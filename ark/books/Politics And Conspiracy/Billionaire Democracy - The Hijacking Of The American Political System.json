This country’sfailure to reflect supermajority preferences in its public policies marks it asa low-quality democracy.The search for ways to improve the quality of America’s democracy begins with anexamination of a system as old as mankind: the exchange of goods for value.Inherent in this system, at the intersection of politics and economics, is adefault setting that occurs in virtually all societies, including capitalistones: A handful of powerful individuals inevitably come to dominate botheconomic and political life. Democracy was devised to neutralize this defaultsetting, and the quality of a democracy is measured by how effectively itdisrupts that default—by how well its political process succeeds in dispersingthe gains from economic activity. Aristotle argued over two millennia ago thatthe quality of democracy can best be measured by the extent of influence enjoyedby the landless.4 [Notes.html#INTF04]Aristotle also observed that oligarchs are naturally displeased by democracy.Democracy’s evolution in Europe over the last millennium—especially after votingfor representatives began in Britain in 1430—has been a struggle marked byrevolution, regicide, and debate as kings and elites resisted being corralled.Democracy, let alone high-quality democracy, has historically been a tenuouscondition—it is under continuous threat from plutocrats and authoritarians andis thus hard won and hard to sustain. Today’s America provides real-timeevidence of that historic fact, and Billionaire Democracy explains why.America’s founding fathers* [Introduction.html#inta] and constitutional framersmade two significant contributions to democracy’s global evolution—the Bill ofRights and an unprecedented expansion of the franchise. Other republics of theirday restricted the franchise to elites and the educated. But our foundingfathers adopted low property thresholds, enabling 60 to 70 percent of whitemales to vote. By the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, other nations hadadopted this broad American-style franchise and crafted democracies thatflourish today, the superior ones characterized by political equality wherevoters are sovereign. But American democracy has floundered because it neverfollowed suit. In 1787, only a handful of years after expanding the vote,America adopted a constitution that explicitly rejected the seminal principle ofpolitical equality.At the root of this rejection is a protest known as Shays’ Rebellion. In 1786,farmers in western Massachusetts protested high taxes and limited credit. Inresponse, the Massachusetts legislature in early 1787 rushed through lawsimposing progressive taxes, providing debt relief, and facilitating the printingof (easy) money. Their reaction revealed for the first time in the new nationthe power of a vastly expanded electorate to sway lawmakers.Bankers, wealthy colonials, and merchants were stunned, and quickly developedmisgivings about the consequences of a grandly expanded electorate. To addresstheir concerns about an electorate that had proven ill-informed and too easilymisled, these elites gathered later that year in Philadelphia to replace thetoo-democratic Articles of Confederation crafted by the founding fathers. Thedesign and architecture of the resulting Constitution was driven by a compellingfear, expressed by Alexander Hamilton in what proved to be his last letter,capitalization included, sent one day before his calamitous duel: “Our realdisease . . . is DEMOCRACY.”5 [Notes.html#INTF05]Three Imperatives of the ConstitutionThe framers not only had misgivings about the outsize influence voters couldwield on policy decisions when given full equality and sovereignty, but theyalso wanted to ensure that lawmakers themselves could not be unduly influenced.The Constitution addressed their concerns about legislative decision making inthree ways.First, the framers stripped power from voters, placing policy decisions in thehands of senators, federal judges, and a president selected by elites. Hamiltonexpressed the intent that “All men of respectability . . . must [ensure] thatthe power of government is entrusted to proper hands.”6 [Notes.html#INTF06]James Madison, the primary author of the Constitution and the smartest man inthe room, explained in Federalist 10 that the Constitution was designed forlawmakers to naturally second-guess voters, their duty being to “refine andenlarge the public views, by passing them through the medium of a chosen body ofcitizens, whose wisdom may best discern the true interest of their country . ..”7 [Notes.html#INTF07]The framers’ retreat from a government featuring voter sovereignty was quicklycriticized by advocates of democracy. Within days of the Constitution’sunveiling, the Federal Farmer, on October 12, 1787, lamented ordinary voters’lack of power as well as the hurdles placed by the framers to prevent reformersfrom unwinding the new, undemocratic constitution with amendments: “Every man ofreflection must see, that the change now proposed, is a transfer of power fromthe many to the few, and the probability is, the artful and ever activearistocracy, will prevent all peaceable measures for changes . . .”8[Notes.html#INTF08]As historian Michael Klarman accurately summarized, “The Constitution wasdesigned to reverse the democratic trajectory of American politics.”9[Notes.html#INTF09]Second, the framers sought to enhance the independence and integrity of therepresentatives by banning bribery of public officials. Indeed, they viewed thebuying of lawmaker votes a seminal threat to the new nation. In his Federalist52 essay, for example, the meticulously prepared Madison insisted that membersof Congress must resist entreaties by donors and favor seekers.10[Notes.html#INTF10] Their fear was existential: The framers believed the successof the new nation hinged on preventing bribery in any guise.The third way the framers sought to elevate decision making in the new nationwas to strengthen the electorate itself. One option was to mimic Britain, wherethe limited franchise was buttressed by bankers and university graduates beinggranted two votes in parliamentary elections.11 [Notes.html#INTF11] Instead,they embraced fact-based media reporting—only newspapers in their day—in hopesof creating an informed electorate resistant to being misled by fabulists. Withthe recent uprising by his western neighbors in mind, for example, prominentMassachusetts delegate Elbridge Gerry warned the Constitutional Convention thatvoters were being “daily misled . . . by the false reports circulated bydesigning men,” whom he alliteratively labeled “pretend patriots.”12[Notes.html#INTF12] And Madison warned in Federalist 63 that voters must becomealert in order to reject what today we call fake news—he termed it “artfulmisrepresentations by interested men.”13 [Notes.html#INTF13] In addressing theConstitutional Convention, Madison was explicit, warning that ill-informed,misled voters “will become the tool of opulence and ambition, in which case . .. property and individual liberty will not be secure in their hands.”14[Notes.html#INTF14]An electorate armed with factual information was central to the framers’ visionfor the First Amendment and indeed to the success of the new nation. Here is thesingle most powerful sentiment that Madison expressed of all the dangers thatconfronted the new nation: “A popular government, without popular information,or the means of acquiring it, is but a prologue to a farce or a tragedy; orperhaps both. Knowledge will forever govern ignorance; and a people who mean tobe their own governors must arm themselves with the power which knowledgegives.”15 [Notes.html#INTF15]Madison and his fellow framers viewed the choice starkly. A democracy whosevoters are misinformed or otherwise lack factual information and thus “the powerknowledge gives,” will assuredly be a troubled nation, destined to become afarce or worse. Abraham Lincoln, America’s greatest president, shared thefounders’ obsession with the centrality of facts to a democracy: “I have faithin the people. They will not consent to disunion. The danger is, that they aremisled. Let them know the truth and the country is safe.”The Low Quality of American Democracy Is Documented by the Income BiasThe low quality of American democracy reflects the failure of lawmakers and theSupreme Court to honor and operationalize the second and third imperatives setforth by the framers. They have failed to corral political corruption or to seekan electorate armed with facts. These failings are long-standing, but havebecome considerably more pronounced in recent years. Above all, the embrace ofpay-to-play—decriminalizing the buying of lawmakers’ votes—by the Supreme Courtis the primary reason that American democracy is of low quality.The most credible and objective proof is provided by what political scientistsrefer to as the income bias, examined in chapter 2 [Chapter02.html]. Income biasdescribes a society where public policy outcomes reflect elite preferencesrather than broadly held preferences. The income bias explains why Americanwages in the key manufacturing sector are $10 an hour lower than in otherwealthy democracies, why America lacks employer-paid maternity or annual leave,why America has the lowest minimum wages and why America alone among the richdemocracies elects huckster populists. It also captures the array of policiesresponsible for the decline in the share of national income received by middle-and working-class Americans in the bottom half from 20 percent in 1980 to 12percent in 2014. That income has been redirected upward. The share accruing tothe top 1 percent rose from 11 percent when Ronald Reagan took office to 20percent by 2014.16 [Notes.html#INTF16] (Overall, the top 20 percent or so ofworkers—so-called knowledge workers—have enjoyed some gains in real wages inrecent decades, although the gains are highly skewed to the top 5 percent andespecially the top 1 percent.)The income bias is a consequence of a skein of Supreme Court rulings explored inchapter 3 [Chapter03.html] that have placed the industrial-scale buying ofpublic officials’ votes at the center of American democracy. Beginning withBuckley v. Valeo (1976), pay-to-play has been empowered by the Court. The narrowmajority of Supreme Court justices responsible for the Buckley genre believethat the buying of lawmaker votes is some sort of free enterprise variant ofdemocracy where (to paraphrase Stanford economist Tibor Scitovsky) what votersreceive depends on how much each of them spends on politics—a rather starkabandonment of James Madison, the framers, and of originalism. (Scitovsky was apioneer in marrying the study of happiness and economics, writing, “Consumersovereignty in a free enterprise economy is a plutocracy, the rule of the rich,where each consumer’s influence on what gets produced depends on how much hespends.”)17 [Notes.html#INTF17] Thus, while America adheres to many of thepractices of other wealthy democracies in conducting its elections, its ballotboxes are de facto stuffed by judicially empowered elites. For their part,lawmakers honor the preferences of the wealthy donor class for the same reasonrobber Willie Sutton focused on banks—“Because that’s where the money is.”The transformation of the US economy wrought by the Buckley era is widelyacknowledged; here is how prominent hedge fund manager Jeremy Grantham put it:“Steadily increasing corporate power over the last 40 years has been . . . thedefining feature of the US government and politics in general.”18[Notes.html#INTF18]Writing in June 2017, in the wake of Associate Justice Neil Gorsuch’sconfirmation to the Supreme Court, the conservative Grantham explicitly creditedthe Supreme Court for this transformation: “Corporate power, however, reallyhinges on other things, especially the ease with which money can influencepolicy. In this, management was blessed by the Supreme Court, whose majority inthe Citizens United decision put the seal of approval on corporate privilege andpower over ordinary people. Maybe corporate power will weaken one day if itstimulates a broad pushback from the general public . . . I suggest you don’thold your breath.”19 [Notes.html#INTF19]Corralling Aristotelian oligarchs more effectively has enabled the quality ofdemocracy in other wealthy nations to forge ahead, leapfrogging well beyond theUnited States. In comparison, America is a low-quality democracy lacking votersovereignty, with policy outcomes commonly unreflective of middle-class ormajoritarian preferences. Indeed, in the eyes of the late dean of Americanpolitical scientists, Robert Dahl, that characteristic calls into questionwhether the United States should any longer be viewed as a democracy. In hisbook Polyarchy, Dahl asserted that “A key characteristic of a democracy is thecontinuing responsiveness of a government to the preferences of its citizens,considered as political equals.”The low quality of America’s democracy is responsible for rising economicinequality in recent decades, characterized by wage stagnation and the declineof collective bargaining among blue- and most white-collar workers. Politicalinequality has begotten economic inequality with flat wages while there havebeen handsome and rising returns on capital. That further begets politicalinequality, trapping most Americans in what French economist Thomas Pikettycalls an “endless inegalitarian spiral.” This spiral unsurprisingly has nurturedcynicism, bringing the inestimable value of democracy itself into question: 32percent of surveyed Americans now express support for an authoritariangovernment.20 [Notes.html#INTF20] They have grown disaffected with thefoundational values of democracy that are responsible for the remarkableinternational spread of human rights, prosperity, and middle classes since thenineteenth century. Frankly, it’s stunning that so many Americans arediscontented with the only device in history proven capable of disruptingmankind’s dismal default setting.Even before the 2016 election, pay-to-play had caused America to be viewed asthe most corrupt of all wealthy economies. The global scold TransparencyInternational, surveying internationally in 2015, ranked America as onlysixteenth best in controlling public corruption, its governance more corrupt inrecent years than Barbados or Uruguay, and on a par with Chile, Qatar, and theBahamas.21 [Notes.html#INTF21] Gallup surveys have found that governmentcorruption is perceived to be more widespread in the United States than innations such as Belize, Estonia, Malta, or Slovakia.22 [Notes.html#INTF22] Theseassessments are evidenced by two of the last five elections, in whichpopular-vote losers were elevated over winners to become US president. In the2000 presidential election, five Supreme Court judges overruled the majoritydecision of 104 million American voters to elevate a member of their ownpolitical party. If the two preceding sentences were not associated with thiscountry, most Americans reading them would instantly consider such a nation tobe a corrupt, faux democracy.Accountability for the Income BiasThe Supreme Court is responsible for pay-to-play, supplanting votes with dollarsas today’s political medium of exchange. But responsibility for policies thatreflect the income bias itself is shared in different degrees by lawmakers fromboth political parties. Democrats shoulder some of the blame, but scholars holdRepublicans considerably more accountable—a consensus that is also reflected inmuch of this book.DemocratsDemocratic Party officials arrogantly overlook concerns of its traditionalnoncollege white voter base, as argued by scholars such as University ofCalifornia Hastings College law professor Joan C. Williams and pollster StanleyGreenberg.23 [Notes.html#INTF23] Infatuated with market fundamentalism, too manyleft-leaning economists have given only lip service over the past three decadesto the Democratic Party’s traditional focus on the economic plight of America’sworking and middle classes. For decades as wages stagnated, they have refused toadvance the seasoned systemic innovations used by other wealthydemocracies—requiring employers to share productivity gains with employees—thathave produced steadily rising real wages. The innovation accomplishing thatoutcome is German-style codetermination, where employees comprise half ofcorporate boards of directors (discussed further in chapter 1 [Chapter01.html]).This innovation yields the most proficient version of capitalism in the worldfor avoiding American-style wage stagnation or sending jobs offshore. Yet thatpotent and time-tested upgrade of corporate governance is ignored despite beingfor decades the norm for “contemporary corporate governance” in other wealthydemocracies across northern Europe.24 [Notes.html#INTF24] The nation’s mostprogressive Democratic politicians, such as Senators Bernie Sanders andElizabeth Warren, are in the dark. That has left the Democratic Party with ameek, ersatz wage agenda—with feet of clay on their signal issue. Moreover, boththe Clinton and Obama administrations were complicit in job offshoring that hasseen imports rise from 6.2 percent of nonenergy manufacturing inputs in 1984 to16.4 percent in 2010.25 [Notes.html#INTF25]Secretary Hillary Clinton suffered from a drop compared to President Obama inturnout among (unenthusiastic) minorities whose wages have stagnated. And shelost white noncollege voters by a 39 percentage point margin—voters fired bypopulist anger with flat wages, job offshoring, and the perception thatDemocrats coddle Wall Street millionaires, minorities, and immigrants at theexpense of “real” Americans. In exit polling, 80 percent of white noncollegevoters in 2016 said their personal economic situation was worse or no betterafter eight years of the Obama administration.26 [Notes.html#INTF26] Thisinattention to Americans of modest means was repaid in kind in November 2016.RepublicansDemocrats have been inattentive to middle-class wage stagnation, but Republicanleaders have become overtly hostile to higher wages. And wages will assuredlycontinue to stagnate during the inept and erratic Trump administration. Moreresponsive than Democrats to the donor class, the GOP aggressively pursues asmall-government agenda that features profit maximization through deregulationand wage suppression. The party of Lincoln, Teddy Roosevelt, and Eisenhower isnow committed to the narcissistic agenda of many of America’s most affluentfamilies, who are covetous of wealth stratification. That commitment hasproduced America’s first ideologically pure political party, its lawmakerswilling, for instance, to strip health care from tens of millions ofworking-class families to fund tax cuts for their donors. Thomas Mann of theprogressive Brookings Institution and Norman Ornstein of the conservativeAmerican Enterprise Institute explained the consequences of this transformationin 2012: “We have no choice but to acknowledge that the core of the problem lieswith the Republican Party . . . The GOP has become an insurgent outlier. It hasbecome ideologically extreme; contemptuous of the inherited social and economicpolicy regime; scornful of compromise; unpersuaded by conventional understandingof facts, evidence and science; and dismissive of the legitimacy of itspolitical opposition.”27 [Notes.html#INTF27]Fake NewsThe furtherance of the donor class agenda has been enhanced by the emergence offake news as a potent GOP political tool. The misrepresentation of facts forpartisan gain or profit is as old as humankind. It has been exacerbated inrecent years, most dramatically by conservatives on talk radio, at partisanorganizations such as Fox News, and on social media platforms by cyberentrepreneurs, polemists, political partisans, and Kremlin propagandists.Importantly, weaponized fake news proved politically effective for Republicansin 2016. By Election Day, for instance, two-thirds of voters supportingcandidate Donald Trump believed the unemployment rate rose under Obama (it fellby more than one-half to near full employment by 2016). Only 17 percent ofRepublicans believed that Obamacare reduced the number of Americans withouthealth insurance to the lowest in history.28 [Notes.html#INTF28] And two-thirdsof Trump supporters also believed that the election machinery in America can berigged, enabling three or four million illegal votes to be cast for formerSecretary Clinton.The GOP exacerbated its afactual narrative by demonizing mainstream fact-basedreporting. Channeling Joseph McCarthy and President Richard Nixon from December1972,29 [Notes.html#INTF29] for instance, candidate Trump routinely assertedthat “the press is the enemy,” attacking factual journalists as “enemies of theAmerican people.”30 [Notes.html#INTF30] The disconcerting outcome was that bythe end of 2016, barely one-third of Americans retained faith in factual,mainstream journalism.The GOP prospered by polarizing America. Immediately before the GOP theologyfully embraced pay-to-play in 1994, only 21 percent of party members surveyed bythe Pew Research Center had a “very unfavorable view of Democrats.” Thetransformation since is stunning, with that figure nearly tripling to 58 percentby 2016.31 [Notes.html#INTF31] Democrats’ distrust of Republicans has grown aswell. Only 21 percent of Americans now believe the nation is united.32[Notes.html#INTF32] And political scientists document that the share of swingvoters has declined by half since the 1990s to barely 5 percent today.33[Notes.html#INTF33] The Republican Party’s success with fake news in engineeringdistrust and polarization has diminished the moderate middle of Americanpolitics, rendering compromise based on an agreed body of facts less likely.The framers primarily rested their aspirations for the new nation on publicofficials free from bribery and an electorate well-armed with facts. Americatoday is failing to fulfill those hopes. The challenge before us now is todivine how America can avoid becoming the farce or even the tragedy feared byJames Madison.[images/line.jpg]* [Introduction.html#rinta]As used herein, the founding fathers refer to thoseinvolved with the Declaration of Independence and the Articles of Confederation,not the later constitutional framers."},{"pageContent":"SECTION 1 [Contents.html#SEC01][images/common.jpg]America Is a Low-Quality Democracy [Contents.html#SEC01a]THE LOW QUALITY OF American democracy reflects denial of majoritarian rule, aneventuality sought by many of America’s wealthiest. Stout majority rule in otherwealthy democracies has translated into larger government sectors funding anexpansive array of public services. Alarmed by this powerful postwar evolution,a number of conservative American billionaires have contrived in recent decadesto deny voter sovereignty and rule by majority. Their names, tactics, andstrategies have been extensively documented by researchers such as Jane Mayer,Nancy MacLean, Kim Phillips-Fein, and Steven M. Teles.The chapters in this section examine how they have exploited Supreme Courtrulings embracing pay-to-play to achieve success. Their tawdry accomplishment ismeasured in the redirection upward of the gains from growth since the Reaganadministration—leaving wages stagnant and lowering opportunity while darkeninghopes and the American dream for most (chapter 1 [Chapter01.html]). Theiraccomplishment is documented by the Income Bias (chapter 2 [Chapter02.html])resulting from their exploitation of pay-to-play (chapter 3 [Chapter03.html])centered on the successful suborning of the Republican Party (chapter 4[Chapter04.html])."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1 [Contents.html#CH01][images/common.jpg]Faux Democracy: America’s Decline to History’s Dismal Default Setting[Contents.html#CH01a][American] economic inequality has followed through to political inequality anddemocratic government is bereft of power and capacity.1 [Notes.html#C1F01]—Stein Ringen, Oxford Professor Emeritus, 2014The main question confronting us today is not really about capitalism in the21st century. It is about democracy in the 21st century.2 [Notes.html#C1F02]—Joseph Stiglitz, The Great DivideThe hollowing out of middle income households is a US-only phenomenon.3[Notes.html#C1F03]—The Financial Times, December 2016POLITICAL DECISIONS DETERMINE WHO receives the fruits of capitalism.High-quality democracies spread those fruits broadly. The low quality ofAmerican democracy is at the heart of America’s middle- and working-classeconomic stagnation. Flat wages and rising income disparity are eroding thespirit of community, enthusiasm, and optimism just as they did during the GreatDepression when Franklin Roosevelt affirmed that “necessitous men are not free.”A Majority of Americans Believe the American Dream Is DeadThe US economy has been misfiring for most Americans for over a generation—wageshave been flat, millions of quality jobs exported, and economic mobility hasdeclined. The decline in economic opportunity is so pronounced that thephenomenon is common fodder for leading European newspapers. The Financial Timesin August 2017, for instance, headlined “Five Charts Show Why Millennials AreWorse Off Than Their Parents.”4 [Notes.html#C1F04] Indeed, 54 percent of USrespondents to the 2013 Economic Values Survey cited by Brookings Institutioneconomists believe the American Dream of opportunity as originally defined byJames Truslow Adams is dead: “Hard work and determination are no guarantee ofsuccess.”5 [Notes.html#C1F05] Their pessimism is fact-based. Upward mobility foryouths has fallen sharply since the 1980s. Some 92 percent of Americans bornduring the 1940s, for instance, earned more than their parents ininflation-adjusted or real dollars. Fewer than half of those born in the 1980shave done as well.6 [Notes.html#C1F06]With wages today scarcely better for most people than earned by their parents,optimism about the future has rightly suffered. Surveys document that decades ofwage stagnation have caused Americans to grow pessimistic about the future fortheir children. Only 21 percent of respondents to a Wall Street Journal/NBC Newssurvey in 2014 believed their children would live better, a record low inpolling. The share stood at 54 percent in 1980 before Ronald Reagan launchedtoday’s era of inequality.7 [Notes.html#C1F07]Some workers have realized higher wages, but an overwhelming majority hassuffered stagnant or real wage declines. Even many of the better educatedyounger workers today earn no more than did younger workers with less educationin 1980. And overall, census data show that the real median income of youngworkers aged twenty-five to thirty-four was 5.5 percent lower in 2016 ($35,000)than in 1975 ($37,000).8 [Notes.html#C1F08] True, household incomes rose until1999, but that reflected women working longer hours. Since then, overall familyincomes have fallen. As documented in an analysis prepared for the NationalBureau of Economic Research in April 2017, weak wages have caused lifetimeearnings for an entire generation of Americans to flat-line or fall. And noimprovement is expected by the authors of this authoritative analysis: “Partiallife-cycle profiles of income observed for cohorts that are currently in thelabor market indicate that the stagnation of lifetime incomes is unlikely toreverse.”9 [Notes.html#C1F09]Since Ronald Reagan, birth status has come to dictate life’s opportunities fortoo many, hardening American social classes. Importantly, despite eight years ofa Democratic White House, the ability of labor unions to raise wages has beenthe weakest since the 1920s. Economists at the International Monetary Fund haveconcluded that this factor alone is responsible for about one-half of theerosion in net US income equality between 1980 and 2010.10 [Notes.html#C1F10]Dwindling opportunity and flat wages explain why two-thirds of respondents to aPublic Religion Research Institute survey in 2015 believed that “one of the bigproblems in this country is that we don’t give everyone an equal chance inlife.”11 [Notes.html#C1F11] The ensuing despair has bled into the social fabricfor Americans of modest means, who are experiencing rising opiate abuse andsuicide rates and falling marriage rates.Wage Rates and Economic Mobility, Here and AbroadIn contrast to America, voter sovereignty translates to economic policies thatcreate prosperous middle-class societies in higher quality democracies. Theoutcome is that economic mobility is more robust there, with youths readilyearning more than their parents did at the same age. Their superior performancebegins at an early age with abundant public prenatal care, expansive child care,early prekindergarten, quality health care, and inexpensive, qualityeducation—kindergarten through college. Investment and job up-skilling is higheras well, causing workforce skill levels in northern Europe and Australia to nowexceed those of the United States.12 [Notes.html#C1F12] Unsurprisingly,productivity levels in nations such as Belgium, Denmark, and France now surpassAmerica’s.13 [Notes.html#C1F13]The beneficence of these policies for low- and middle-income cohorts isexemplified by Germany. Real wages there at lower income levels rose steadilyduring the 1990s at more than 1 percent annually, even outpacing earnings growthat the top of the income scale. That trend slowed during the 2007 economiccrisis. But real wage growth at low- and middle-income levels has since returnedto the long-term trend of around 1 percent per year.How do the real earnings of lower wage workers in Germany and across westernEurope keep pace with income growth at the middle and top? German economistsexplain:[T]his development is also likely a result of changes linked to the collectivebargaining policy. In the hospitality sector, for example—an industry withparticularly low wages—collective-agreement wages increased between 2010 and2015 (by 16.7 percent in the East and 9.9 percent in the West). Although not allemployees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement, the tariff increasesmay have also had an influence on the wages of companies that were not bound bythe agreement. Trade unions were increasingly successful in claiming andenforcing sectoral [widespread] collective agreements . . .14 [Notes.html#C1F14]The contrast with America is dramatic. Hourly pay adjusted for inflation inGermany has increased nearly 30 percent since 1985.15 [Notes.html#C1F15] Laborcompensation as a share of national income has actually increased in Germanysince the 2007 recession, rising from 47.6 percent to nearly 51 percent.16[Notes.html#C1F16] And the gains continue today. In fact, the average 2.5percent real wage gains reported by the Federal Statistics Office for Germanworkers in 2015 alone matched the cumulative rise in median real American weeklywages between 1979 and 2015.17 [Notes.html#C1F17] More broadly, real wages rosean average of 1.4 percent in the twenty-eight European Union (EU) countries in2015 and 1.7 percent in 2016.18 [Notes.html#C1F18]These steady gains have enabled real salaries abroad adjusted for purchasingpower to leapfrog American wages. In the capstone manufacturing sectors ineleven wealthy democracies, wages and benefits are now more than $10 per hourhigher than in the United States, according to the US Bureau of LaborStatistics.19 [Notes.html#C1F19] Service sector wages have risen steadily atnearly the same pace.20 [Notes.html#C1F20] Even so, despite notably higherwages, higher quality democracies outcompete America. Germany is the mostcompetitive economy on earth, its manufacturing sector is robust, wages are highand rising, and unemployment in 2016 was at a twenty-five-year low. Similaroutcomes are commonplace across western Europe, where GDP grew faster in 2016than in America despite their higher wages.21 [Notes.html#C1F21] Burger Kingemployees in Denmark earn $20 per hour (versus $9 in the United States), receivefive weeks’ paid vacation, overtime bonus pay, national health insurance, paidmaternity and paternity leave, and have a pension plan.22 [Notes.html#C1F22]This striking contrast between falling American and rising western Europeaneconomic opportunity and wage performance is reinforced by internationaleconomic mobility statistics; they measure how readily males in various nationscan improve their economic situation through education and diligence. At thiswriting the most recent assessment is from May 2016 by Miles Corak of theUniversity of Ottawa, published by the Stanford Center on Poverty andInequality.23 [Notes.html#C1F23] He and his colleagues concluded that Americahas devolved into a low-mobility society where parental status is increasinglythe determinant of lifetime economic prospects: Intergenerational earningsmobility of Americans is lower than in every nation of northern Europe. Americaneconomic mobility is just one-half that of Australia and Canada. The anemicrewards from education and hard work for American men is little better than forcontemporaries in Chile or Argentina, where widespread wage stagnation andrising inequality also chill economic opportunity.Higher wages also mean the quality of life for most families in northern Europeis superior, with secure retirements, longer vacations, and necessities such asquality public education, child care, college, and health care more broadlyavailable and affordable. Specific economic policies enacted in response tomiddle-class demands are responsible for the success of these countries and fortheir higher economic mobility, especially policies linking wage increases torising productivity. That linkage is the black box behind their success inwidely broadcasting rising incomes.Economic outcomes similar to Europe today were commonplace in America during thepost–World War II decades, ending only with the arrival of the Reagan era andpay-to-play. Between 1947 and 1972, real wages in America rose steadily withimproving productivity, which increased 97 percent over this period while realmedian pay rose 95 percent.24 [Notes.html#C1F24] This postwar boom temporarilycreated history’s greatest middle class—now eclipsed by northern Europe. Manymen and women could control their own economic futures in an opportunity societywhere striving frequently produced a secure and rewarding life for college andhigh school graduates alike. By 1968, income disparities were the lowest inAmerican history, as measured by a standard used by economists, the Ginicoefficient.25 [Notes.html#C1F25]During this era, real wages rose because lawmakers both heard and heeded popularsentiment for rising family prosperity, creating a high-quality Americandemocracy.Labor Unions and Economic Growth, Here and AbroadNorthern European lawmakers and citizens view labor unions as existential alliesin the struggle to fend off the default setting of capitalism. In contrast, toomany Americans—particularly billionaires, GOP lawmakers, and the Republicanmajority on the Supreme Court—reject labor unions and their role as antibioticsfor the inequalities that are woven into capitalism’s DNA. Unions are thebackbone of the northern European model of dynamic economies with robust socialprotections that deliver steady real income growth up and down the incomeladder. This union-friendly mindset, reflected in public policies, is whycorporations in northern Europe widely broadcast prosperity. Wages there risefaster than inflation, roughly in line with productivity growth. Collectivebargaining is why the bottom 90 percent of workers across western Europe and inOceania have received a far greater share of the gains from economic growth thanhave Americans since the Reagan era (chart 1.1). For example, the bottom 90percent of Danish employees have received 90 percent of all income growthbetween 1976 and 2007, while during the same period, the bottom 90 percent ofAmericans received only 18 percent.[images/pg20.jpg]Chart 1.1 Share of Income Growth Accruing to the Bottom 90 Percent 1976–2007.“Focus on Top Incomes and Taxation in OECD Countries: Was the Crisis a GameChanger?” Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, May 2014,chart 3, www.oecd.org/social/OECD2014-FocusOnTopIncomes.pdf[http://www.oecd.org/social/OECD2014-FocusOnTopIncomes.pdf]As concluded by the Financial Times in December 2016, after examining thewealthy democracies: “The hollowing out of middle income households is a US-onlyphenomenon.”26 [Notes.html#C1F26]Comparing American and European Work EffortUnemployment rates are higher in some EU nations than the United States, butthat primarily is an artifact reflecting the millions of discouraged Americanswho no longer are counted in the labor force. In Europe, by contrast, higherwages encourage men and women to work. Indeed, Americans find it startling tolearn that more Europeans than Americans work. Specifically, a higher proportionof both European men and women twenty-five to fifty-four years old—the cohortcentral to middle-class family prosperity—work than their counterparts inAmerica. The data from the US Council of Economic Advisors is unequivocal. Some12 percent of twenty-five- to fifty-four-year-old American men were neitherseeking work nor employed in 2014, for instance. That figure was only 7 percentin France and Spain and 4 percent in Japan.27 [Notes.html#C1F27] Higher Europeanworkforce participation translates to fewer of the pathologies unfortunatelygrowing common in the United States, such as addiction and suicide, explored byRobert Putnam in Bowling Alone, as well as by Angus Deaton, Ann Case, and othersociologists. Importantly, the International Monetary Fund has concluded thatthe strong collective bargaining institutions, codetermination, and otherpractices responsible for steadily rising wages in other wealthy democracieslike Germany are costless: They do not slow productivity or GDP growth.28[Notes.html#C1F28]The Reagan Administration Launched the Age of Political and Economic InequalityToday’s age of rising political and economic inequality was ushered in by the1980 election of Ronald Reagan. An analysis by the Economic Policy Institutefound that 70 percent of all income growth from 1935 to 1980 went to the bottom90 percent of households, while 7 percent went to the top 1 percent. Since 1980,however, real wages have barely risen, despite per capita production rising 80percent,29 [Notes.html#C1F29] with the top 1 percent garnering 72 percent of allincome growth.30 [Notes.html#C1F30] By receiving much of new income growth, theshare flowing to the 1 percent grew to exceed 22 percent of all national incomein 2012, compared to 11 percent in 1944.31 [Notes.html#C1F31]Former American central bank (Federal Reserve) chairman and conservative BenBernanke notes that the wage stagnation, declining economic mobility, and theweaker workforce participation of our era reflects a failure of public policybeginning with Reagan: “The Reagan revolution heralded a more constrainedapproach to economic policy . . .”32 [Notes.html#C1F32] Bernanke explains theideological “errors and omissions” of Reagan were repeated by both the Clintonand George W. Bush administrations, which failedto expand job training and re-training opportunities, especially for the lesseducated; to provide transition assistance for displaced workers, includingsupport for internal migration; to mitigate residential and educationalsegregation and increase the access of those left behind to employment andeducational opportunities; to promote community redevelopment, through grants,infrastructure construction and other means; and to address serious social illsthrough addiction programs, criminal justice reform and the like.The outcome of Bernanke’s “Reagan revolution”—ending the steady postwar rise ofreal wages—has created a second Gilded Age. The original nineteenth-centuryversion was described by the American Populist Party platform of 1892: “Thefruits of the toil of millions are boldly stolen to build up colossal fortunesfor a few, unprecedented in the history of mankind; and the possessors of those,in turn, despise the republic and endanger liberty. From the same prolific wombof governmental injustice we breed the two great classes—tramps andmillionaires.”33 [Notes.html#C1F33]Other wealthy democracies have continued to broadcast income growth widely sincethe 1980s because their citizens have retained political leverage; their votersare sovereign. An example of this is the minimum wage. Unlike the United States,the proportion of low-wage workers in Germany, for instance, is stable.34[Notes.html#C1F34] That is because, also unlike the situation in the UnitedStates, rising poverty induced the German government to institute a nationwideminimum wage and to increase it regularly to €10 per hour in 2017. In contrast,the “Reagan revolution” ushered in decades of stagnant wages (the real minimumwage has declined), job offshoring, widespread acceptance of greed in corporateexecutive suites, a spread in employment contracts containing noncompete andmandatory arbitration clauses, and a surge of independent contracting. Weakerunions are a key factor in US wage stagnation, and the combination ofpay-to-play and hostility to collective bargaining has caused the share of unionjobs to be the smallest since 1916, a hundred-year low. The American middleclass is paying a high price for weaker unions: The Bureau of Labor Statisticsreports that union members had annual earnings of about $49,000 in 2013,compared to $38,600 for comparable nonunion workers.35 [Notes.html#C1F35]Certainly, rapid technology change and globalization have contributed a bit towage stagnation. But the continued growth of real wages in northern Europeaffirms that the policies of Reaganomics are primarily responsible for US wagestagnation. After all, the high-wage economies of northern Europe experiencedthe same technology transformation as America in recent decades. Moreover, theyare even more involved in international trade. Yet real wages there havecontinued to increase.The most important reason is that voters, not political donors, are sovereign.Their political architecture favors majoritarian rule. Pay-to-play is explicitlyrejected (as reviewed in detail in chapter 10 [Chapter10.html]). Lawmakers havenaturally responded to satisfy those sovereigns. They have installed workscouncils in corporations (employee groups performing the equivalent ofmidmanagement duties in US firms), shareholder approval (“say-on-pay”) for CEOand director compensation levels, and, importantly, codetermination to reformcorporate governance. Codetermination requires that employees sit on corporateboards of larger domestic firms in order to ensure a middle-class rather than anelitist firm mission. Those laws are sweeping, applicable also to foreigninvestors. For instance, the $200 million invested by American private equityfirm KKR in the Nuremberg-based GFK in April 2017 included the appointment ofthree new corporate board members.36 [Notes.html#C1F36] They displaced existingshareholder representatives, leaving the original power of employees’representatives unaffected.Employee representatives on corporate boards would upgrade governance atAmerican firms. Employee representatives naturally focus on long-termprosperity, which results in greater investment, R&D, and higher wages. Thatdifferent focus is a major reason that corporate prosperity in northern Europetranslates to family prosperity. To put it in Aristotelian terms, theirpolitical systems produce more equitable economic outcomes because their“landless” are kings.That is not America, and foreign observers know it, exemplified by Germanjournalist Marc Hujer writing in Der Spiegel: “During the last few decades, . .. [America] has been a country in which the rich have become richer, and thepoor poorer, and in which the middle class seems to be disappearing and, withit, the sense that everyone shares in rising prosperity.”37 [Notes.html#C1F37]And here is former Australian Treasurer Wayne Swan, quoted in the BrisbaneTimes, “Don’t let what has happened to the American economy happen here. Don’tlet Australia become a down-under version of New Jersey, where the people andcommunities whose skills are no longer in demand get thrown on the scrap heap oflife.”38 [Notes.html#C1F38]In Australia, Canada, and northern Europe, the policy preferences of a majorityof citizens are implemented by responsive lawmakers. The sovereignty of votersis responsible for their superior economic performance, with income disparitiesfar smaller than in the United States. Indeed, the United States has the mostsevere income disparity of any wealthy democracy—more skewed than Greece orPortugal and comparable to that of authoritarian Turkey.39 [Notes.html#C1F39]America’s Shrinking Middle ClassThe median weekly wage of a full-time American worker in the all-encompassingnonfarm business sector in 2016 was a bare 3.3 percent ($11) higher than in1979, after adjusting for inflation.40 [Notes.html#C1F40] This stagnation beganin the 1980s and has been exacerbated by today’s gig economy, where manyemployee–employer relationships are impersonal and transactional. The number of“nonstandard jobs”—temporary, on-call, independent contractor gigs, or workerssupplied by outside contractors—has risen 70 percent since 2006 to 24 million,now comprising one in six jobs.41 [Notes.html#C1F41] They are popular withemployers, enabling them to dodge benefit and other employee costs such asSocial Security or Medicare taxes. Thus “nonstandard” translates to lowerwages—7 percent less for janitors, 14 percent less for educators, up to 24percent less for security guards, and 9 percent less in retailing, according toeconomists.42 [Notes.html#C1F42] Combine that with job offshoring, weak laborunions, and the migration of jobs to the nonunion American South, and theconsequence is new American jobs that are disproportionately insecure and lowwage. Indeed, Harvard economist Lawrence F. Katz and Alan B. Krueger ofPrinceton have concluded that a whopping 94 percent of employment growth since2007 has been in nonstandard categories.43 [Notes.html#C1F43]Data show that new jobs created in recent decades have consistently paid lessthan the old ones they replaced. More than 40 percent of the 8.5 million jobslost in 2008 and 2009, for instance, had median wages above $20 an hour. Butonly 30 percent of jobs created through February 2014 were comparable.44[Notes.html#C1F44] The international Organisation for Economic Co-operation andDevelopment (OECD) has concluded that the United States has the largest share oflow-wage jobs of any wealthy democracy.45 [Notes.html#C1F45]The outcome of Reaganomics is exemplified by the average wage of $12 per hour atAmerica’s largest employer, Walmart. In contrast, the average pay at GeneralMotors—America’s largest employer in the 1960s—was $35 an hour in today’sdollars.46 [Notes.html#C1F46]These trends have reduced the American middle class, as documented by the Pewresearch organization.47 [Notes.html#C1F47] According to an April 2016 analysis,the share of American adults between 2000 and 2014 living in middle-incomehouseholds declined in 203 of 229 metropolitan areas examined.48[Notes.html#C1F48] And a Pew study one year later found that the share ofAmerican adults living in middle-income households dropped nearly 5 percentbetween 1991 and 2010.49 [Notes.html#C1F49] Contrary to the views ofconservatives at the American Enterprise Institute and elsewhere, householdsfalling out of the middle class account for most of that decline.50[Notes.html#C1F50]Americans know it. A detailed Pew survey in 2014 (see chart 1.2) found for thefirst time ever that the share of Americans who consider themselves below middleclass nearly equaled the share self-identifying as middle class. One in sixAmericans who considered themselves middle class in 2008 have since fallen out,causing a 40 percent jump in the share of Americans who self-classify as belowmiddle income. Moreover, the ranks of those who consider themselves above middleincome (not shown) have also declined from 22 percent in 2008 to 16 percent in2014.This subjective assessment is supported by objective international data. Americanow has the smallest middle class of any wealthy democracy, using global OECDstandards. Measured by the share of households with disposable incomes betweenone-half and twice the national average, America’s middle class is smaller thanevery nation in western Europe and even Russia. It is comparable to the size inUruguay and is scarcely larger than in developing nations with notably skewedincome distributions such as Egypt, Mexico, Brazil, and South Africa.51[Notes.html#C1F51][images/pg26.jpg]Chart 1.2 Self-defined by respondents.Rakesh Kochhar and Rich Morin, “Despite Recovery, Fewer Americans Identify asMiddle Class,” Pew Research Center, January 27, 2014,www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/01/27/despite-recovery-fewer-americans-identify-as-middle-class/[http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/01/27/despite-recovery-fewer-americans-identify-as-middle-class/]Beginning in the Reagan presidency, the income garnered by the top 5 percent ofAmerican households grew faster than in every other democracy while the incomeaccruing to the middle class grew the least. That has caused America to dropnear the bottom of wealthy democracies in providing equal economicopportunities. In 2011, for instance, the German Bertelsmann Foundation rankedAmerica twenty-eighth of the thirty-one highest income democracies, providingless economic opportunity than considerably less affluent nations such asIreland, Poland, Portugal, and Slovakia. It only ranked ahead of Chile, Mexico,and Turkey—nations with far lower per capita incomes and weak investments ineducation and other public goods integral to upward mobility. Notably, theseother low opportunity nations share the US pay-to-play political systems andthus are low quality democracies.52 [Notes.html#C1F52] In a separate analysisthree years later in 2014, officials with the United Nations Development Programalso placed the United States only twenty-eighth in its prominentInequality-adjusted Human Development Index measuring citizen overallwell-being.53 [Notes.html#C1F53]Low-Quality American Democracy as Described by AristotleThe market economies of Aristotle’s day intrigued him with their promise ofexpanding prosperity, and he devoted considerable attention to the pivotal rolethat politics play in determining market outcomes. He observed that over time,markets produce economic inequality and a class of predatory elites he termedoligarchs. Unless corralled, they deploy their economic power to subvert thepolitical process, inevitably leading to a reduction in the quality of democracyand in turn more severe economic inequality. So powerful was this insight thatAristotle made it his measure of the quality of democracy.54 [Notes.html#C1F54]As noted earlier, his key test was the extent to which preferences of thelandless are reflected in policy outcomes: “What differentiates oligarchy anddemocracy is wealth or the lack of it. The essential point is that where thepossession of political power is due to the possession of economic power orwealth, whether the number of persons be large or small, that is oligarchy, andwhen the unpropertied class have power, that is democracy.”55 [Notes.html#C1F55]Aristotle’s Politics and humanist Ethics explored this theme and wereinspirations to political revolutionaries of the seventeenth and eighteenthcenturies, including Thomas Hobbes, Thomas Jefferson, and John Locke.56[Notes.html#C1F56] And his seminal principle linking democracy and economicoutcomes has been repeatedly affirmed in America since the colonial era. Drawingon experience during the Gilded Age, for instance, Supreme Court Justice LouisBrandeis concluded that Americans “may have democracy or may have politicalpower concentrated in the hands of a few, but can’t have both.”57[Notes.html#C1F57]In recent years, econometricians have explored the Aristotelian theme inunprecedented detail. Using gigantic digitalized statistical bases, they havedeveloped a data-rich understanding of the economic character and historicevolution of cultures.58 [Notes.html#C1F58] Economists Daron Acemoglu of theMassachusetts Institute of Technology and James Robinson of Harvard documentthat past societies have rarely been uplifting for the 99 percent, virtuallyalways subject to relentless predation by elites. In Why Nations Fail, theyconclude that political elites always connive to extract economic surplus, andeconomic elites always connive to control politics. Thus, de facto indenturedmen, women, and children, dehumanized as prey, analogized to beasts of burdenand tribal others, have been a large proportion of nearly all societiesthroughout history. There were only four relatively brief epochs before thepolitical revolutions beginning in seventeenth-century Europe where the grip ofelites was considerably if temporarily eased and innovative, entrepreneurial“new men” could emerge: in the ancient Greek city-states beginning with Corinth;Republican Rome prior to Caesar; the thirteenth-century Venetian Republic; andthe handful of innovative textile centers that emerged in fifteenth- andsixteenth-century Europe in circumstances conducive to entrepreneurship.The Quality of Politics Determines Economic OutcomesLike Aristotle, Acemoglu and Robinson conclude that the political nature of asociety is the major determinant of how the gains from growth are allocated.They and others, such as historian Yuval Harari, explain that the defaultsetting of history is for predatory, exclusive economic and political systems togo hand-in-hand.Periods of high-quality democracy, as in postwar America until the 1980s, orEurope today, are rare and tenuous. They are continuously under threat fromAristotelian oligarchs, as noted by Oxford professor Stein Ringen: “Democracy isnot the default. It is a form of government that must be created withdetermination and that will disintegrate unless nurtured.”59 [Notes.html#C1F59]Political and economic equality are unnatural states, achieved and sustainedonly through a relentless, vigorous struggle against long odds, as summarized byOECD officials: “Equitable societies with large middle classes are not thenatural outcome of market forces. Equity, rather, is created by society, byinstitutions—the laws, policies and practices—that govern the society, itseconomy and in particular its labor markets.”60 [Notes.html#C1F60]Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz notes that elites design “the rules of the gameto ensure this outcome; that is, through politics.”61 [Notes.html#C1F61] TheGreeks called this plutocratic bias of market economies diaploki, theconsequence of an incestuous relationship between powerful economic andpolitical actors. Martin Wolf of the Financial Times explains “this outcome is‘rule by affluent vested interests,’ or quite simply, plutocracy.”62[Notes.html#C1F62]In the modern era, this predatory, extractive default setting began to give wayonly in the wake of the remarkable seventeenth-century revolutions in politics(and the later revolution in technology when James Watt had perhaps the singlemost transformative scientific insight in human history: Compressed steam pushesback). More equitable income distributions and expanding middle classes began toemerge on the heels of political tumult as political revolutions in Britain andEurope slowly gained traction. Most notably, the British Glorious Revolution of1688 affirmed the principle that legislatures rather than monarchs rest at thecenter of governance. This transition was neither peaceful nor linear, insteadachieved as a consequence of revolution, regicide, great depression, or war. Asinclusive or pluralistic governing systems with diffused political poweremerged, popular pressure for the development of more inclusive economic systemsfeaturing social safety nets and labor rights grew. In America, Acemoglu andRobinson note that rising suffrage produced a “gradual virtuous circle” ofpolitical and then social and economic reforms. “The political changes wereunmistakably toward more inclusive political institutions and were the result ofdemands from empowered masses.”63 [Notes.html#C1F63] The capstone democracymodel that emerged only slowly across western Europe, Britain, Oceania, andNorth America is a fragile, historical aberration from the natural state ofmankind.Creating Political EqualityCountries such as America that desire greater economic equality must first craftinstitutions that promote and sustain political equality. The post–World War IIgovernments of nations such as Denmark and Germany created high-qualitydemocracies featuring political equality and voter sovereignty. The ensuingpublic policies created opportunity societies characterized by strong wagegrowth, universal health care, collective bargaining, quality daycare,stakeholder corporate governance, quality schools, routine job up-skilling,inexpensive higher education, and the like.Codetermination and High-Quality DemocracyHigh-quality democracies diffuse economic gains and increase economicopportunity with policies that link de facto growth in real wages to laborproductivity growth. The institution at the center of this process iscodetermination. By requiring that employees sit on corporate boards of largerdomestic firms, codetermination ensures a middle-class corporate culture. It isa culture that is also focused on long term firm prosperity, rising real wages,and little if any job offshoring. It’s a concept that is sixty years old, andhas been adopted by nineteen of the twenty-seven EU nations (not counting thedeparting UK). In Germany, for instance, employees occupy half of the seats onboards of directors at the six hundred largest firms.64 [Notes.html#C1F64]The prowess of codetermination is affirmed by the German economic performance.Its impact on job offshoring was documented in October 2016 by the internationalconsulting firm EY (Ernst & Young) using data from the blue-chip firmscomprising Germany’s DAX 30 stock index. The study period was 2011 to 2015.These firms are global household names such as Adidas, BMW, Daimler, and Merck,all with codetermination governance systems. EY analysts found that the increasein sales made abroad (either exports or produced abroad) by these firms (28percent) considerably exceeded their creation of foreign jobs (8 percent). Thedifference was satisfied by adding jobs at home to produce exports. Thatexplains why German employment increased at these huge firms domestically by agreater amount than their rise in domestic sales.65 [Notes.html#C1F65] Thisoutcome reflects the impact of employees sitting on these corporate boards,attentive to long-term firm prosperity, investment as well as expanding domesticemployment.These policies are the precise opposite of policies pursued by many largerAmerican firms, who grow by offshoring higher wage US jobs to low-wage nations.For example, a Wall Street Journal analysis by David Wessel covering the periodfrom 2000 to 2009 found that American multinational firms eliminated a net of2.9 million domestic jobs while adding a net of 2.4 million jobs abroad.66[Notes.html#C1F66] A second study by Martin A. Sullivan on behalf of thenonpartisan Tax Analysts think tank confirmed that data. It found that USmultinationals cut a net 1.9 million domestic jobs during this period whileadding a net 2.35 million jobs abroad.67 [Notes.html#C1F67] The lesson:Codetermination prevents job offshoring. It ensures that corporate job growthoccurs at home rather than in low-wage nations abroad.68 [Notes.html#C1F68]Handelsblatt editor Frank Specht quotes German president Joachim Gauck asdescribing codetermination as “an important cultural asset,” because of itscentrality to middle-class prosperity in capitalism.69 [Notes.html#C1F69]American Ignorance of CodeterminationThe responsiveness of lawmakers to voter preferences explains why higher qualitydemocracies achieve steadily rising real wages. Laws and institutions such asthose in Germany produce outcomes that are the antithesis of American-style wagesuppression.70 [Notes.html#C1F70] Yet, Americans are simply unaware that thenorthern European variant of capitalism produces larger and more affluent middleclasses, with superior future prospects as well. European economists such asThomas Piketty regularly explore the profile and dynamics of thesesuperior-performing democracies and their economies. But his Americancounterparts are mostly mum.71 [Notes.html#C1F71] Progressive Americaneconomists, many liberal organizations, and mainstream media economicjournalists have kept American voters in the dark (no public shaming, but youknow who you are). Only a handful of American industry and labor experts writeabout the superior living standards in northern Europe, including Scott N. Paulwriting in the New York Times in December 2016: “We’re not Germany, with itshigh-wage, high-export and stable manufacturing sector . . .”72[Notes.html#C1F72] But only rarely are the higher living standards ofmiddle-class Europeans and their greater workforce participation even noted inthe US media. Few economic journalists and academic economists in the UnitedStates are informed about works councils and codetermination, with exceptionssuch as Olivier Blanchard at MIT (born in France), Larry Fauver at theUniversity of Tennessee, Michael Fuerst at the University of Miami, and BarryEichengreen at the University of California, Berkeley. It is ironic that themost thorough analysis clarifying that shareholders in codetermination firmsearn higher returns than shareholders in firms lacking codetermination has beenconducted by two American economists, Fauver and Fuerst.73 [Notes.html#C1F73]Low-Quality American Democracy: The Income BiasStagnant wages since the Reagan revolution signal that American democracy is oflower quality than in northern Europe, with US policy outcomes reflecting thepreferences of higher income Americans, producing what political scientists callthe income bias.Surveys reveal that voters realize their votes are outweighed by donors,including respondents to the November 2015 survey, noted earlier, by the PublicReligion Research Institute. Some 64 percent, for example, believe their “votedoes not matter because of the influence that wealthy individuals and bigcorporations have on the electoral process.” Some 79 percent (including 63percent of Republicans) believe American capitalism “unfairly favors thewealthy.”74 [Notes.html#C1F74] Only 5 percent believe the government looks afterthe interests of the middle class.Americans also realize that the income bias has grown more severe of late. Pewpolling in 2015 found that 76 percent of Americans believe money has a greaterinfluence on politics and elected officials “today than in the past”; only 22percent see little difference. And 74 percent believe that elected officials“don’t care what people like me think.” That figure is up from 55 percent in2000.75 [Notes.html#C1F75]Four factors are primarily responsible for the income bias. The first is thecorporate culture that emerged during the Reagan presidency, drawing on thenarcissistic free-market philosophy of the Russian émigré and atheist AlisaRosenbaum (Ayn Rand). This culture embraces Rand’s “rational selfishness”philosophy, urging corporate officials to set aside biblical teachings in favorof their own pecuniary self-interest. The Randian revolution marked abandonmentby executive suites of the postwar model of stakeholder capitalism, in whichcorporations had been managed to benefit employees and local communities as wellas shareholders. It demonized the collective bargaining responsible for highwages and prioritized behaviors designed to facilitate the seizure of windfallsby senior executives armed with stock options. Share buybacks, uneconomicalleveraged buyouts or mergers, and corporate inversions are other manifestationsof this syndrome. Stock options became widespread, with executive remunerationtied to next quarter’s earnings per share. The consequence was a sharp focus byCEOs on self-aggrandizement attained by raising short-term quarterly profits,achieved by allowing cash flow to fall to the bottom line—cash flow that hadpreviously been devoted instead to R&D, wages, and investment. The reduction ofcorporate cash flowing to investments in order to show greater current incomeexplains why privately held firms (where CEOs are tightly monitored) invest at astunning 2.5 times the rate of public US companies (10 percent of assets vs. 4percent).76 [Notes.html#C1F76]A second factor contributing to the income bias is a willingness of wealthyconservatives to aggressively invest in politicians in order to further theirphilosophy of small government. They have donated and spent billions of dollarson the GOP to further their agenda of boosting profits through wage suppression,deregulation, and greater market concentration, while also seeking to lowertaxes at the expense of spending on public R&D, innovation, education, and thelike.A third factor is a transformation of the Republican Party in the early 1990sthat was initiated by then-Congressman Tom DeLay and Speaker of the House NewtGingrich. DeLay believed that accumulating political power necessitated anexpansive pandering by the GOP to affluent donors, especially corporateinterests and wealthy staunch conservatives. Gingrich, as quoted by E.J. DionneJr., explained to Republicans, “You’re fighting a war. It’s a war for power.”77[Notes.html#C1F77]Fourth is the decriminalization of political bribery that marks the Buckleypay-to-play era since 1976, to be discussed in chapters 3 and 8. The SupremeCourt ruling in Buckley v. Valaro and similar decisions including CitizensUnited has transformed the currency of American democracy to, well, currency,rather than votes.These four factors explain why numerous lawmakers have come to favor the agendaof donors rather than the preferences of the broader public, with a profoundimpact on the quality of American democracy. As quoted in the New York Times,Trevor Potter, a former Republican member of the Federal Election Commissionadmits, “It just takes a random billionaire to change a race and maybe changethe country.”78 [Notes.html#C1F78] Acemoglu and Robinson explain that “Inclusiveinstitutions . . . can also reverse course and become more extractive because ofchallenges during critical junctures.”79 [Notes.html#C1F79] Two such criticaljunctures were President Nixon’s four Supreme Court appointees, responsible forthe original Buckley ruling, followed more than a decade later by the threesimpatico appointees by Ronald Reagan. America’s economic inequality comes fromthe political inequality ushered in by the era of pay-to-play and the otherthree factors. As noted earlier, Piketty describes this etiology as producing an“Endless Inegalitarian Spiral,” portraying the decades since Reagan this way:“We subsequently see a rapid rise in inequality in the 1980s until by 2000 wehave returned to a [1910–1930] level on the order of 45–50 percent of nationalincome [flowing to the top 10 percent]. The magnitude of the change isimpressive: . . . [an] unprecedented explosion of very elevated incomes . . .The egalitarian pioneer ideal has faded into oblivion, and the New World may beon the verge of becoming the Old Europe of the twenty-first century’s globalizedeconomy.”80 [Notes.html#C1F80] This theme is also reflected in numerous recentworks by other economists including Robert Reich and Joseph Stiglitz.81[Notes.html#C1F81]Recall that Aristotle’s test of the degree of democracy is the extent to whichthe economically powerful are constrained, with preferences of the landlessreflected in policy outcomes.

Indeed, independent scholars analogize thestratification of contemporary US political outcomes with the behaviors evidentduring the end times of the first democracies in ancient Greece. Here is SteinRingen: “In Athens, democracy disintegrated when the rich grew super-rich,refused to play by the rules and undermined the established system ofgovernment. That is the point that the United States . . . [has] reached. Boththese governments came up against concentrations of economic power that havebecome politically unmanageable.”4 [Notes.html#C2F04]Recently, scholars have examined the money–politics nexus in America, bringingto bear digital databases of unprecedented size and detail.5 [Notes.html#C2F05]Documenting an Income BiasIn his 2012 book Affluence and Influence, Princeton political scientist MartinGilens merged decades of data on federal legislative votes, with survey data onboth political donations and voter preferences parsed by respondents’ incomes.Gilens found a statistical correlation between federal policy outcomes and thepolicy preferences of higher income citizens; in contrast, policy outcomes hadno correlation with preferences of other income classes:Money—the “mother’s milk” of politics is the root of representational inequality. . . Under typical circumstances, the middle class has no more sway than thepoor when their preferences diverge from those of the affluent . . . Theassociated pattern of policy influence and political contributions offer atleast one highly plausible explanation for the inequality in policyresponsiveness to different economic strata . . . This representationalinequality was spread widely across policy domains, with a strong tilt towardhigh-income Americans on economic issues, foreign policy and moral/religiousissues . . .6 [Notes.html#C2F06]Moreover, Gilens found that this income bias has become stronger during thedecades since 1980:My expectation was that representational inequality had grown in the US alongwith the growth in economic inequality. I did find evidence of this pattern inthe steadily rising responsiveness to the well-off—but not to other incomelevels—over the four decades covered by my data . . . In recent decades theresponsiveness of policy makers to the preferences of the affluent has steadilygrown, but responsiveness to less-well-off Americans has not.7[Notes.html#C2F07]Like other research on the nexus of money and politics, the study by Gilens wasindicative, but statisticians found his evidence only suggestive, a correlation.However, a more expansive and meticulous second analysis by Gilens, published in2014 with coauthor Northwestern University political scientist Benjamin Page,definitively documented for the first time evidence of an income bias. Theirseminal analysis found a strong statistical causal relationship between thepolicy preferences of top earners and federal policy outcomes. The odds of therelationship they revealed occurring randomly are quite remote, making theiranalysis historically significant—a smoking gun. The evidence is compelling:America’s claims to being a democratic society are seriously threatened . . .Multivariate analysis indicates that economic elites and organized groupsrepresenting business interests have substantial independent impacts on USgovernment policy, while average citizens and mass-based interest groups havelittle or no independent influence . . . When the preferences of economic elitesand the stands of organized interest groups are controlled for, the preferencesof the average American appear to have only a minuscule, near-zero,statistically non-significant impact upon public policy.8 [Notes.html#C2F08]Gilens, Page, and their research assistants evaluated 1,779 contentiousCongressional votes over more than two decades beginning in 1981. Those policyvotes were carefully matched with contemporary public opinion surveys on thesame topics. The survey data were differentiated by respondent incomes,segregated into three income ranges—the tenth percentile of family incomes (meanincome $12,200 in 2012), fiftieth percentile ($51,000), and ninetieth percentile($146,000). The policy preferences of various interest groups such as unions andbusiness lobbyists were also evaluated separately in the study. Thisencompassing analytical approach and huge data set enabled Gilens and Page todetermine the likelihood that a particular policy outcome would be realizedbased on the specific preferences held by various income groups.They found that economic elites (and separately, business lobby organizations)have dominated American policy outcomes since the 1980s:Until very recently it has not been possible to test theories [of policydominance] against each other in a systematic, quantitative fashion . . . Wehave been able to produce some striking findings. One is the nearly totalfailure of the “median voter” to influence policy . . . In the United States,our findings indicate, the majority does not rule—at least not in the causalsense of actually determining policy outcomes. When a majority of citizensdisagrees with economic elites and/or with organized interests, they generallylose.9 [Notes.html#C2F09]You have just read the definition of income bias. Even more compelling, theirstatistical analysis occurred before the Citizens United ruling (discussed inchapter 3 [Chapter03.html]) or the surge into politics in recent years ofprivate money, corporate money, and independent expenditures by political actioncommittees (PACs) and super PACs.Americans enjoy the trappings of democracy, including free elections; but theyare only trappings. The most powerful political science analysis of our era hasconcluded that average Americans have little or no influence on governmentpolicy outcomes. There are certainly instances when the policy preferences ofmiddle- and low-income citizens are reflected in policies. But Gilens and Pageconclude that such occasions occur only in the happy coincidence whenhigh-income voters share those preferences. When preferences of top-incomeearners conflict with those of low- or middle-income citizens, lawmakersconsistently ignore the latter two groups.The inconsequential nature of average Americans’ political clout is depictedgraphically in chart 2.1, one of the most important in this book. If only 10percent of top earners favor a particular policy outcome, the odds of thatoutcome occurring were found to be less than 10 percent. However, as the shareof top earners favoring that outcome rises to 90 percent, the odds of thatoutcome becoming law increase by about 45 percentage points (to better than 50percent in total). In contrast, as the share of average Americans (the 50thincome percentile) favoring a policy outcome rises from 10 percent to 90percent, the odds of that outcome improved by less than 4 percentage points.Gilens and Page note: “Not only do ordinary citizens not have uniquelysubstantial power over policy decisions; they have little or no independentinfluence on policy at all . . . When a majority—even a very large majority—ofthe public favors change, it is not likely to get what it wants . . . [elitesare] calling the shots.”10 [Notes.html#C2F10]Gilens and Page also teased out the influence of organized groups, includingmass organizations such as the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) orlabor unions, on public policy outcomes. They found that business groups such asthe Chamber of Commerce hold considerably more sway in Washington than evenenormous groups like AARP and unions whenever their agendas conflicted: “Thesebusiness groups are far more numerous and active; they spend much more money;and they tend to get their way . . .”11 [Notes.html#C2F11] Lee Drutman, adonations expert at the nonpartisan New America Foundation, concluded in 2015that the business community outspent such mass membership groups by a whopping34:1 margin. This advantage was up from 22:1 in 1998.12 [Notes.html#C2F12]Campaign donations or the promise of them, rather than membership numbers, isthe decisive factor; trade unions and groups like the AARP have vastly largermemberships than business groups, but the latter contribute vastly more money,the key determinant of influence.*[images/pg39.jpg]Chart 2.1 Top earners dictate federal policy outcomesMartin Gilens and Benjamin I. Page, “Testing Theories of American Politics:Elites, Interest Groups and Average Citizens,” Perspective on Politics,September 2014, doi: 10.1017/S1537592714001595The political impotence of average Americans has consequences because theirpolicy preferences differ from those of higher income households or fromcorporate groups such as the Chamber of Commerce. The preferences of averagefamilies include higher wages, environmental protections, stronger worksitelabor protections, consumer protections, higher taxes on corporations instead offamilies, and an end to job offshoring. But their preferences are mostlyignored. Gilens and Page concluded that “empirical support for majoritarianpluralism looks very shaky, indeed.”13 [Notes.html#C2F13]Evidence of the Income Bias in Federal Tax and Spending ProgramsFurther analytic verification of the income bias is provided by a separate studyprepared under the auspices of the nonpartisan Washington-based Center on Budgetand Policy Priorities. Arloc Sherman, Robert Greenstein, and Kathy Ruffingutilized detailed budget and tax data from 2010 and 2011 in an analysisconcluding that federal programs viewed comprehensively redistribute incomeupward rather than downward.14 [Notes.html#C2F14] The large national entitlementprograms like Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and food stamps redistributeincome downward, disproportionately favoring lower income households. Yet whentax policies and all individualized federal spending policies are added to thedata, their impact swamps entitlement flows, yielding an upward netredistribution by government.Most of this upward redistribution is due to large tax benefits, called taxexpenditures by budgeteers, whose benefits disproportionately accrue to higherincome households. Examples include charitable donation and home mortgage taxdeductions. The researchers concluded that about 30 percent of all incomeredistributed via entitlements and tax expenditures by the federal governmentgoes to the top-earning 20 percent of households (see chart 2.2). For everydollar redistributed to the poorest 20 percent of Americans by the federalgovernment, $1.35 is redistributed to the highest earning 20 percent.15[Notes.html#C2F15][images/pg41.jpg]Chart 2.2 2010 (budget) and 2011 (tax expenditures). Entitlement spendingrepresents 60 percent of federal budget outlays; excluded are federal programswith diffused benefits including defense, general programmatic spending, andcivil service.

Even so,ordinary Americans share the same hopes and aspirations as citizens of peernations. Quite naturally, they seek to improve their lives and favor governmentpolicies that address such hopes. There are no comprehensive studies like thoseof Gilens and Page that assess causal linkage transnationally betweenpreferences, incomes, and policy outcomes. There are, however, databases thatprovide evidence of correlation. The most comprehensive is another big-dataanalysis by College of William & Mary professor Christopher Howard usingstatistics from the International Social Survey (ISSP), a respected survey thatdocuments citizen attitudes from Europe, the United States, Britain, and Canada.Reproduced from Howard’s 2008 statistics, chart 2.3 displays the degree ofsupport among US and foreign respondents for greater spending on governmentprograms like health care or education. Americans were more supportive ofadditional government spending for social services and for education thanrespondents in these other wealthy democracies. And they were nearly asenthusiastic about increased government spending in the other areas surveyed,except running hospitals and reducing income gaps.[images/pg42.jpg]Chart 2.3 Citizen preferences in Canada, Germany, Italy, Norway, Sweden, andBritain compared to the United States.Christopher Howard, The Welfare State Nobody Knows (Princeton, NJ: PrincetonUniversity Press, 2008), table 6.01.Other surveys document similar support among US citizens for such public goods.A March 2013 survey of public attitudes found that 53 percent of US respondentsbelieved it is a duty of government to provide government jobs if necessary toprovide employment for all those willing to work.16 [Notes.html#C2F16] Aseparate June 2013 survey of rural Americans by the Center for Rural Affairsfound that more than 80 percent of respondents supported more governmentspending for infrastructure, preschooling, and job retraining.17[Notes.html#C2F17] Some 66 percent of respondents in a New York Times/CBS Newssurvey in May 2015 believed the gap between rich and poor is widening and thatthe distribution of wealth should be more even.18 [Notes.html#C2F18]Weak American Efforts to Ameliorate Economic InequalityAmericans have the same strong preferences for government income redistributionas citizens in peer nations, but government policy outcomes abroad betterreflect aspirations of average citizens, defining them as higher qualitydemocracies.The most comprehensive international indicator of economic policy outcomes areOECD statistics documenting the extent to which government tax and incomepolicies change domestic income distributions. All thirty-four OECD membernations utilize tax and spending programs to redistribute income downward,drawing from the affluent to improve the lot of the less fortunate.In nearly every instance, such practices reduce the ex-ante market (prior togovernment redistribution) income disparities, although the magnitude variesgreatly as we now see.Utilizing OECD data, Drew DeSilver of the Pew Research Center measured theintensity of government redistribution policies through their impact on Ginicoefficients. This statistical measure of income distribution noted earlier wasdeveloped before World War II by an Italian, Corrado Gini.19 [Notes.html#C2F19]On the Gini scale of 0 to 1, zero value means that all citizens have the sameincome while a value of 1 denotes that one person receives all income. Thefigures in chart 2.4 are the changes in Gini coefficients as a consequence ofgovernment tax and transfer policies. The value shown for each nation is the netdifference between the Gini coefficient calculated using ex-ante market(pregovernment) incomes and the Gini coefficient calculated ex-post afteraccounting for the impact of government income redistributions. For example, thedepicted US figure is .119; that is the difference between the 2010market-income (pregovernment redistribution) Gini coefficient of .499, and theGini coefficient of .380 measuring income disparities with federal governmenttaxes and transfers included (postgovernment redistribution). For comparison,the German tax and income transfer programs reduced its ex-ante market-incomeGini coefficient by .206 points or by nearly twice as much as US policies.The US market-income (pregovernment) Gini figure of .499 is easily the mostskewed of any wealthy democracy, reflecting the relatively large American incomedisparity. Even so, the American income redistribution effort is paltry comparedto peer nations. In fact, only three nations (South Korea, Switzerland, andChile) have weaker redistributive outcomes (not shown) than the American .119.Chile makes virtually no effort to redistribute income. And both South Korea andSwitzerland have weaker efforts because the ex-ante market (pregovernment)income disparity in each nation is dramatically more equal than in the UnitedStates: The market-income Gini coefficient values for South Korea andSwitzerland respectively were .342 and .372, in contrast to .499 for the UnitedStates. In fact, income is more equally distributed in Korea and Switzerlandbefore government redistributive policies are applied than are American incomesafter government redistribution (.380 as detailed momentarily).[images/pg44.jpg]Chart 2.4 Change in Gini coefficients (reduction in income disparities) as aconsequence of federal taxes and transfers; 2010 data except Japan 2009 andChile 2011.Drew DeSilver, “Global Inequality: How the US Compares,” Pew Research Center,November 19, 2013,www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/12/19/global-inequality-how-the-u-s-compares/[http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/12/19/global-inequality-how-the-u-s-compares/]The relatively weak government redistribution effort means the ex-post Americanincome disparity is significantly more unequal or skewed than in other OECDnations. The post-redistribution US Gini coefficient of .380 is about 30 percentlarger than values of the other large democracies of Germany (.286) or France(.303), as reproduced in chart 2.5. These are simply huge differences,emblematic of large middle-class economies, unlike the United States. In fact,America has the most skewed income disparity after government redistributionprograms of all OECD nations aside from Brazil, Chile, and Mexico. It mostclosely resembles that of authoritarian Turkey.20 [Notes.html#C2F20] As noted,these outliers share American-style pay-to-play political systems.[images/pg45.jpg]Chart 2.5 Gini coefficients after federal government taxes and transfers.Drew DeSilver, “Global Inequality: How the US Compares,” Pew Research Center,November 19, 2013,www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/12/19/global-inequality-how-the-u-s-compares/[http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/12/19/global-inequality-how-the-u-s-compares/]DeSilver did not address whether government redistribution policies extract apenalty by slowing economic growth, a contentious issue not resolved until 2014,the year after his analysis was published. Until then, despite lacking evidence,conservative American economists, including the late Arthur Okun, had assertedthat government redistribution policies slow growth and diminish economicefficiency. The flood of digitized international statistics in recent yearsenabled economists at the International Monetary Fund in 2014 to apply rigor tothat question. They found the trade-off imagined by Okun and others betweenredistribution and growth to be mythical: “The best available macroeconomic datado not support such a conclusion.”21 [Notes.html#C2F21] The considerableredistribution conducted by higher quality democracies such as Belgium, Austria,and Germany does not reduce GDP or productivity growth. Indeed, Americanevidence suggests that redistributional programs can aid growth and employmentby reducing inequality. A 2016 analysis by economists at the World Bankconcluded that the increase in inequality from falling American householdincomes between 1998 and 2013 reduced consumer spending by over 3 percent. Thewidening income disparities accounted for an overall decline in US consumerspending of about $400 billion annually, slowing both GDP and job growth.22[Notes.html#C2F22]The impact of economic inequality on US social indicators has also beenexamined. In The Spirit Level, for instance, public health scholars Kate Pickettand Richard Wilkinson teased out the impact of rising inequality on lifeexpectancy, teen motherhood incidence, and the like. They concluded that anumber of social pathologies such as infant mortality, addiction, suicides, andmental illness grow worse as income disparity rises. Other data suggest thesepathologies—already evident among Black Americans—have become especially evidentof late among economically stressed white working-class Americans.Ronald Reagan: When American Income Disparity Began to SkewAs noted earlier, American income disparity is an international outlier, themost exaggerated of the wealthy democracies. We have seen how this profileemerged in the 1980s, when most gains from growth began to flow upward, withpolitical scientists James Druckman and Lawrence Jacobs confirming that theReagan administration initiated this sea change.23 [Notes.html#C2F23] Itspolicies, noted in chapter 1 [Chapter01.html], produced a sharp reversal of theeconomic outcomes common during postwar decades.The shift in distribution of the gains from growth that began during the Reaganadministration has produced the grandest income redistribution in world history.Compared to income shares in 1980, the amount now being redistributed each yearfrom wages to profits is comparable in magnitude to two-thirds of the annualexport earnings of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).Widening income disparity has also caused wealth disparities to skew: Back in1989, the Federal Reserve reported that the top 3 percent of households held44.8 percent of all US wealth; that share increased steadily to 51.8 percent in2007 and to 54.4 percent in 2013.24 [Notes.html#C2F24] A handful of Americanshave grown startlingly wealthy. The six Walmart heirs alone, grown wealthy oninexpensive Asian imports and low wages, are worth as much as the bottom 41percent of US households.25 [Notes.html#C2F25] According to economists EmmanuelSaez and Gabriel Zucman, the wealthiest 16,000 Americans are each worth $110million or 1,100 times the American average. In 1979, they were worth about 220times the average.26 [Notes.html#C2F26]The Income Bias Originates with RepublicansBoth Democratic and Republican lawmakers bear responsibility for the income biasand resulting failure of national policies to ameliorate rising incomedisparities or prosper middle- and working-class Americans. Bipartisan inactionhas long protected the carried interest tax loophole, for instance, savinghigh-income hedge fund managers billions of dollars annually in taxes.27[Notes.html#C2F27]But scholars have grown convinced that Congressional Republicans are vastly moreculpable for laws benefiting the wealthy and in derailing laws and regulationsintended to aid the middle class. The scope of their actions is broad, rangingfrom resisting higher wages (overtime pay or minimum wages) and protectingextravagant levels of pharmaceutical profits to rejecting reforms that wouldpunish Americans and other global tax evaders who use secret offshoreaccounts.28 [Notes.html#C2F28] Indeed, Republican lawmakers in states such asMissouri go so far as to preempt local efforts to improve wages, strippingcounties and communities of the ability to raise minimum wages within theirjurisdictions. Even some conservatives assign most of the blame for these andother behaviors that widen income disparities to Republicans. ProminentRepublican and conservative Christopher Caldwell of the Weekly Standard, forinstance, in September 2014, acknowledged the “[economic] inequality for whichRepublicans are rightly given much of the blame.”29 [Notes.html#C2F29]There’s plenty of evidence that supports Caldwell’s assertion. A 2008 analysisby Vanderbilt University political scientist Larry Bartels concluded that GOPlawmakers (senators specifically) are considerably more responsive to the agendaof high-income Americans than to middle-class preferences. In contrast,Democratic Party senators were found to be most responsive to the middle class,displaying considerably less of an income bias. Bartels drew on votingstatistics from the 101st, 102nd, and 103rd Congresses (1988–1994) to assess howthe voting behavior of senators tracked the preferences of various incomeclasses. The ideological votes he evaluated involved employer versus employeerights (raising the minimum wage, enforcing civil rights in the workplace) andshifting federal funds from defense to the antipoverty programs Head Start andlow-income energy assistance. Lawmakers from both parties tend to give littleweight to the opinions of lower income constituents. But Bartels identified asharp partisan divide in the responsiveness of senators to the agendas ofmiddle-income versus upper income groups. And the differences he identifiedpersisted even between senators from different parties who represent the samestate or states with similar ideological profiles.30 [Notes.html#C2F30] Bartelsfound that Republicans paid no more attention to the opinions of middle-classconstituents than to opinions of the poor—which is to say none (chart 2.6). Incontrast, Democratic senators were most attentive to middle-class opinions: “ForRepublican senators, there is no evidence of responsiveness to middle-incomeconstituents, much less low-income constituents. The views of high-incomeconstituents, however, seem to have received a great deal of weight fromRepublican senators on these four issues . . . more than four times as much asfor Democrats . . . Democrats seem to have responded at least as strongly to theviews of middle-income constituents as to the views of high-income constituents. . .”31 [Notes.html#C2F31]Republican Party indifference to middle- and lower-income voter preferences hascontinued in recent years. They have enjoyed majorities in the Senate since 2010and in the House of Representatives since 2014. Yet during that time,Congressional Republicans have been loath to enact policies on a host of issuesthat benefit the middle class—policies that enjoy huge popular support,including higher minimum wages, providing employees advance notice of workschedules, mandating paid sick leave, or raising taxes on high incomes tosustain Social Security (chart 2.7). Such policies are commonplace in higherquality democracies. They are popular with Americans as well, including manyRepublicans, but clash with the priorities of higher income donors.[images/pg49.jpg]Chart 2.6 Middle income ranged from about $35,000 to $70,000.Larry M. Bartels, Unequal Democracy (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press),fig. 9.4.Such policies also clash with a Republican imperative that emerged during theObama administration to deny Democrats legislative successes. For instance, GOPSenate leader Mitch McConnell was rather infamously overheard declaring in 2009:“The single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to bea one-term president.”32 [Notes.html#C2F32]That strategy signaled to donors that the GOP was committed to meeting theirsmall-government agenda while resisting Democrats’ wage, tax, and spendingincreases. Not a single Republican member of the House of Representatives votedfor the Obama administration’s economic stimulus law in early 2009 that averteda deeper recession. Subsequently, they forced federal spending cuts usingcontentious negotiating tactics including a government shutdown in October 2013,the threat of another shutdown in September 2015, and additional threats thatincluded contriving a default on the national debt. In a government whosearchitecture demands cooperation and collaboration for legislative success,polarization and gridlock became routine. Other scholars join Thomas Mann andNorman Ornstein in blaming Republicans. Robert Kaiser in his book Act ofCongress, for instance, describes McConnell’s partisanship in these terms:“Refusing to cooperate with the Democratic president took precedence overlegislating . . . He ruled out bipartisanship because the term itself implied atruce in, or even an end to, the partisan wars. McConnell was no peacemaker . .. He never hid his desire to prevent Obama from winning politically usefulvictories.”33 [Notes.html#C2F33][images/pg50.jpg]Chart 2.7 Popular public preferences rejected by Congressional Republicans.Noam Scheiber and Dalia Sussman, “Inequality Troubles Americans Across PartyLines, a Poll Finds,” New York Times, June 4, 2015 (work schedule); HaroldMeyerson, “The Next Debate Topic,” Washington Post, August 27, 2015 (tax onmillionaires, Social Security); and Robert P.

Discretionary federal government spending in 2016 waslower than in 2005, adjusted for inflation, including an 11 percent drop ineducation spending in real terms.35 [Notes.html#C2F35] Important R&D spendinghas been reduced dramatically: Only 18 percent of grant applications could befunded by the National Institutes of Health in 2015, compared to 32 percent in2000.36 [Notes.html#C2F36] And although President Obama raised taxes on higherincomes, Congressional Republicans have succeeded in reducing the overallAmerican tax burden: Data from the thirty-four richest democracies collected bythe OECD document that the US total tax-to-GDP ratio declined from 28.2 in 2000to 26 in 2014, nearly the lowest (31st) among them. That decline contrasts withthe other democracies, whose average ratio rose slightly over this period to34.4.37 [Notes.html#C2F37] Moreover, tax loopholes abound, leading the SydneyMorning Herald by 2016 to a headline “US Overtakes Caymans as Tax Shelter forRich.”38 [Notes.html#C2F38]The small-government agenda of the GOP benefited its wealthy donors, butweakened the recovery from the 2008 recession. The government sector actuallysubtracted from growth in 2013 and 2014. It added nothing to growth in 2015 andlittle in 2016 or 2017 either.39 [Notes.html#C2F39]The GOP chokehold on fiscal policy placed undue reliance on monetary policyalone to spark growth. Then Republicans promptly took aim at monetary policy aswell, seeking to browbeat independent Federal Reserve Board (Fed) officials intowithdrawing monetary stimulus. Indeed, GOP members of the House ofRepresentatives in June 2016 ignored salient issues including wage stagnation,widening income disparities, and job offshoring to question Fed Chair JanetYellen whether the Fed was solvent. Economists were stunned (the Fed can createmoney at will).40 [Notes.html#C2F40]These GOP strategies presumably pleased donors but reveal how far today’sRepublican Party has strayed from its 1850s roots. It has become a party hostileto the hopes of Lincoln for an activist government expanding economicopportunity to meet the aspirations of average Americans. It has become obsessedwith fulfilling its donor class agenda, relentlessly pressing for partisanadvantage regardless of circumstance, as powerfully explained by Mann andOrnstein: “The clear implication [of McConnell’s strategy] was that if defaultbrought economic hardship and the president and Democrats got blamed, that wouldbe fine. That kind of calculus—putting partisan advantage ahead of problemsolving, with the stakes for the country sky-high—was not politics as usual, atleast not as we have seen it practiced through several generations of partyleaders.”41 [Notes.html#C2F41]Because of the riches on offer from public policies, politics is always andeverywhere a tough business. The Republican Party’s Machiavellian strategy ofslowing the recovery in order to diminish a political opponent is notunprecedented; President Grover Cleveland was victimized by similar tactics in1892. But its intensity and duration is testament to the powerful impact ofpay-to-play on American democracy. One of the most consequential indicators isSenate Republicans’ refusal to seat President Obama’s nominee Merrick Garland in2016, which derailed a potentially progressive majority on the Supreme Court forthe first time in forty years. Indeed, billionaires, including Sheldon Adelsonand Joe Ricketts spent well over $10 million on TV ads in support of the newjustice, Neil Gorsuch, whose 2017 confirmation has cemented pay-to-play forperhaps decades to come.42 [Notes.html#C2F42]The income bias is grounded in pay-to-play. The next chapter examines its rootsin the decriminalization of pay-to-play by conservative Supreme Court justicessince 1976.[images/line.jpg]*Other big-data researchers have also concluded that lawmakers respond primarilyto opinions of the wealthy and to business groups such as the Chamber ofCommerce.

Douglas, in dissent, WheelingSteel Corp., 1949, quoted in Torres-Spelliscy, 2014CHARLES AND DAVID KOCH were the founding funders of the libertarian CatoInstitute and have donated about $30 million to it over recent decades.3[Notes.html#C3F03] They got their money’s worth in Ilya Shapiro, a researcherthere, who made the following statement, which reads like the donor class credo,at a Senate Committee hearing in 2010: “To the extent that ‘money in politics’is a problem, the solution isn’t to try to reduce the money . . . but to reducethe scope of political activity the money tries to influence. Shrink the size ofgovernment and its intrusions in people’s lives and you’ll shrink the amountpeople will spend trying to get their piece of the pie or, more likely, tryingto avert ruinous public policies.”4 [Notes.html#C3F04]There you have it: Public goods are the problem, not private money purchasingthe votes of public officials.Elections still determine who leads America. But the American political systemhas undergone a seminal deterioration in the past generation due to the incomebias, with much of the blame centered on a transformed Republican Party. TheDemocratic Party has retained its postwar sizable core of moderates whose share(35 percent) matches the share of moderates (34 percent) nationwide.5[Notes.html#C3F05] In contrast, both progressives and moderates have been culledfrom the Republican Party in recent decades. The influence of pay-to-play islargely responsible for that party shrinking by one-quarter and morphing into anear-uniformly conservative entity. The agenda of the donor class to cosset thewealthiest Americans has de facto become the GOP’s agenda.The emergence of a political party unduly influenced by a conservative donorclass resembles events in the GOP a century ago during the Gilded Age. In his1913 book, The New Freedom, President Woodrow Wilson expressed alarm about theeconomic power increasingly wielded by the robber barons of his era. He had inmind Cornelius Vanderbilt, John Pierpont Morgan, and especially John D.Rockefeller—the latter controlled 88 percent of American oil production and wassoon (1916) to be the world’s first billionaire. Some wealthy conservatives oftoday exhibit behavior similar to plutocrats such as Vanderbilt, who lived abovethe law, routinely buying the votes of Congress and judges: “What do I careabout the law? Hain’t I got the power?”6 [Notes.html#C3F06]Buckley v. ValeoToday’s reprising of the Gilded Age is rooted in the Warren Burger Supreme Courtdecision Buckley v. Valeo, 424 US 1 (1976). The Court concluded that limits onindependent spending by individuals to benefit politicians were unconstitutionaland also found that limits on candidate electioneering spending wereunconstitutional. Limits on donations directly to campaigns remainconstitutional. The decision began a process of decriminalizing vote buying*[Chapter03.html#C3a] that continues today. Buckley and subsequent similarrulings (the Buckley genre) have produced an era where dollars rather than votesare determinant in American democracy. The rulings have induced numerousAmerican politicians to (correctly) conclude, as Gilens and Page document, thattheir career prospects are maximized by pandering to affluent contributors.Prior to the Buckley era, party elites—officials, lawmakers, consultants,donors, corporate CEOs, activists, and media figures—selected nominees for boththe Democratic and Republican Parties. Elite endorsements were more predictiveof nominating contest outcomes than money, media attention, celebrity, orpolling results. The Buckley era changed that dynamic, elevating donors tooutweigh traditional elites in party matters—at least with Republicans.Democratic lawmakers have failed to support policies ending wage stagnation inrecent decades, but as previously noted by Larry Bartels, they display primarysympathy for middle-class aspirations. They seem less reliant than Republicanson wealthy donors, enjoying ready access to millions of small donors, anddisplay an income bias infrequently. Recall that the Obama administrationreregulated the financial sector, bailed out the auto industry, enactedObamacare, created a consumer finance watchdog agency, and raised tax rates onthe very highest income earners to 1990s levels.In contrast, on the Republican side, what New York Times journalist NicholasConfessore terms the “conservative donor class” has edged aside other elites tojoin the grassroots as the party’s power brokers.7 [Notes.html#C3F07] Thistransformation is the result of a perfect storm of events that included thefollowing elements: a clutch of staunchly conservative and politically savvywealthy donors covetous of small government; the decision by Tom DeLay in theearly 1990s to partner with these conservatives; a sizable core ofsmall-government social conservatives among the GOP grassroots; the 2008election of a Black Democratic president favoring big government activism; and,beginning in the 1990s, the culling of moderates from the GOP. Another majorcontributing factor to the increased donor influence on Republicans was theemergence of a conservative-themed media complex featuring Fox News and talkradio (made possible by President Reagan’s repeal of the Fairness Doctrine,discussed further in chapter 13 [Chapter13.html]). The most important factor wasthe emergence of a clutch of politically active, wealthy conservatives—aneventuality empowered by Buckley. As a consequence, the postwar inclusive andpluralistic American political system morphed into an “extractive, exclusive”one in the lexicon of Acemoglu and Robinson.Nineteenth-Century Darwinians Decriminalized Political BriberyWhen the Burger Court concluded that acquiring the allegiance of publicofficials with cash is a variant of constitutionally protected free speech, itadopted the game-changing notion that individuals are entitled to spend whateverthey can afford to buy the votes of public officials. This purchase of politicalspeech furnishes an individual with a metaphorical sound truck to outshout hisor her neighbors.This novel jurisprudence is grounded in a conjuration, a misinterpretationregarding the nature of speech rights provided by the First Amendment. TheBurger justices’ error was their conclusion that the right to free speechaddresses the amount of speech as well as the traditional interpretation that itaddresses the content of speech. Critics of Buckley contend that everyone isentitled to their own soap box and street corner, but not to rent a sound truck.This seminal distinction was noted by Justice John Paul Stevens writing aconcurring opinion in Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC (2000): “The rightto use one’s own money to hire gladiators, or to fund “speech by proxy,” . . .[is] not entitled to the same protections as the right to say what onepleases.”8 [Notes.html#C3F08]The Buckley conjuration also lacks precedent. Political scientist Robert E.Mutch in 2014 quotes Harvard law professor Laurence Tribe explaining thatBuckley “was obviously not grounded on prior constitutional authority.”9[Notes.html#C3F09] And Harvard law professor Cass Sunstein terms the entireBuckley genre “an adventurous interpretation of the Constitution.”10[Notes.html#C3F10]The founding fathers, the framers, numerous states, and allprior Supreme Court rulings had criminalized virtually all campaigncontributions as political bribery—vote buying. Congress repeatedly agreedbeginning in 1867, notably including the Tillman Act during Theodore Roosevelt’spresidency in 1907 (banning corporate donations), Taft-Hartley in 1947 (banningindependent expenditures on behalf of candidates, parties, or political issues)and the 1974 amendments to the Federal Election Campaign Act (1971) in the wakeof the Watergate scandal.The original intent of the founding fathers at the Second Continental Congressin 1776 and the constitutional drafters in 1787 was a government free ofinfluence peddling and corruption. They were strongly opposed to the buying oflawmakers’ votes, as explained by James Madison: “My wish is that the nationallegislature be as uncorrupt as possible.”11 [Notes.html#C3F11] In Federalist 52,he urged that members of Congress avoid dependence on donors or favor seekers.12[Notes.html#C3F12] George Mason explained the framers’ stark concern in theseterms: “If we don’t provide against corruption, our government will soon be atan end.”13 [Notes.html#C3F13] The framers worried so much that they placedtwenty or so broadly drawn, specific anticorruption clauses in the Constitutionitself.14 [Notes.html#C3F14]Importantly, the framers adopted the broadest possible definition of acts thatconstituted “corruption.” They were political sophisticates and aware that anycampaign contribution was corrupting. They were informed by the prowess ofBritish monarchs using the Royal Treasury to purchase Royalist fidelity amongthe parliamentarians of their day. Central to the context of contemporarypay-to-play is the framers’ unequivocal belief that such “Royal Treasury”largesse represented political vote buying regardless of whether the recipientwould have supported the Palace otherwise—or whether there was an evident quidpro quo. The framers sweepingly viewed all acts of providing and acceptingdonations as inherently corrupting. Harvard law professor Lawrence Lessig in2011 quotes British historian J.G.A. Pocock’s clarification of this importantpoint:The King’s ministers were not attacked for sitting in Parliament, but they wereattacked for allegedly filling Parliament with the recipients of governmentpatronage. For what was universally acknowledged was that if the members of thelegislature became dependent upon patronage, the legislature would cease to beindependent . . . Corruption on an eighteenth-century tongue . . . meant notonly venality, but disturbance of the political conditions necessary to humanvirtue and freedom.15 [Notes.html#C3F15]The founding fathers and the framers would surely reject Justice AnthonyKennedy’s naïve assertion in 2009 that “The fact that speakers may haveinfluence over or access to elected officials does not mean that these officialsare corrupt.”16 [Notes.html#C3F16] They would instead nod in agreement with JackAbramoff, a lobbyist jailed in 2006 for bribery, who summarized the lesson ofhis years of buying votes in Congress this way: “When somebody petitioning apublic servant for action provides any kind of extra resources—money or a giftor anything—that affects the process.”17 [Notes.html#C3F17]Buckley and Citizens UnitedBuckley not only rejects the intent and concerns of the founding fathers and theframers but also contradicts the iconic conservative Barry Goldwater, who arguedeven before the Buckley era that “Senators and representatives . . . canscarcely avoid weighting every decision against the question, ‘How will thisaffect my fund-raising?18 [Notes.html#C3F18] . . . The role of money is way outof line. It’s strangling us. The influence of money distorts everything.Government of and by the people, for example, is waning . . . Our nation isfacing a crisis of liberty if we do not control campaign expenditures. Unlimitedcampaign spending eats at the heart of the democratic process.”19[Notes.html#C3F19]Ironically, Buckley was promulgated in the wake of the Watergate break-in andcorruption scandal that induced enactment of the most comprehensive legislationever in US history to criminalize political bribery. The 1974 amendments to theFederal Election Campaign Act (FECA) established strict limits on donations andcampaign spending, mandated only public funding of presidential elections, andestablished the Federal Election Commission to police campaign finance. Theseaggressive FECA expansions were the high watermark in America’s struggle tocorral vote buying and improve voter equality. The pinnacle of Americanpolitical equality embodied in the FECA amendments lasted only two years.Since 1976, Buckley has been affirmed and expanded by rulings of bare majoritiesof the subsequent Rehnquist and Roberts Supreme Courts. The Buckley genre hasgrown to now include First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti (1978), CitizensUnited v. Federal Election Commission (2010), and McCutcheon v. Federal ElectionCommission (2013). The genre also includes the SpeechNow.org v. Federal ElectionCommission ruling in 2010 permitting unlimited donations; although issued by theDistrict of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals, it was based on Citizens Unitedand was favorably reviewed by the conservative Republican majority on theRoberts Court, hereinafter Roberts Republicans.Lacking precedent and defying original intent, the original Buckley ruling andthe Roberts Court ruling in Citizens United featured legal legerdemain. CitizensUnited redefined “natural persons” to include, well, unnatural persons, drawingon the mischief first conjured in Santa Clara (discussed later) by the MorrisWaite Supreme Court in 1886. Inanimate legal artifices such as corporationscannot vote, attend church, speak, read, pray, or hold office; nor are theynatural persons as defined by Chief Justice John Marshall two centuries ago: “[Acorporation is] an artificial being, invisible, intangible and existing only incontemplation of law.”20 [Notes.html#C3F20] Former Fed chairman Ben Bernankeagrees: “A financial firm is of course a legal fiction; it’s not a person.”21[Notes.html#C3F21] And so does Goldwater, drawing the line quaintly at flesh andblood: “Financial contributions to political campaigns should be made byindividuals and individuals alone.”22 [Notes.html#C3F22]The root of the Buckley genre is nineteenth-century social Darwinism: the‘fittest’ anointed by the market should not be hobbled by the ‘unfittest’ (readon) in the theocratic terms favored by the likes of William Graham Sumner. Apioneering nineteenth-century sociologist at Yale, Sumner gave aid and comfortto plutocrats of the day, providing a veneer of scholarship in his 1883 bookWhat Social Classes Owe to Each Other for their rampant pay-to-play during theGilded Age: “Let it be understood that we cannot go outside of this alternative:liberty, inequality, survival of the fittest; not-liberty, equality, survival ofthe unfittest.”23 [Notes.html#C3F23]In their bodies of work bearing on economic and political concerns, theconservative majorities of the Burger, Rehnquist, and Roberts Courts have dustedoff Sumner’s nineteenth-century notion, ruling repeatedly to crown his“fittest.” They have mimicked the Melville Fuller Court justice, David Brewer,who wrote in Pollock v. Farmers’ Loan and Trust Co. (1895), that civilization’s“unvarying law . . . [is] that the wealth of a community will be in the hands ofa few.”24 [Notes.html#C3F24]They have explicitly rejected Aristotle, not to mention James Madison, BarryGoldwater, and prominent contemporary scholars such as the late Robert Dahl.25[Notes.html#C3F25] They have disenfranchised the powerless and protected thepropertied, gilding the donor class just as historian Lawrence Goldstonesuggests that the Waite and Fuller Courts bequeathed legitimacy to robber baronsof their day: “Social Darwinism had given the capitalist class a great gift: theability to consider itself virtuous while acting in blatant self-interest. Inthe 1780s, slaveholders brandished their Bibles; in the 1880s, Andrew Carnegiebrandished Social Statistics.”26 [Notes.html#C3F26] And in the 1980s,conservative billionaires brandished Buckley.The courts of the Buckley era have exalted the fittest by creating a novelconstitutionally shielded category of speech—a category that can only bepurchased. Thus it is the preserve of those Americans whom the late JusticeScalia believed “best represent the most significant segments of the economy.”Justice Kennedy drew on Scalia’s full quote to explain his own rationale forproviding constitutional protections for political vote buying by the fittest:“The censorship [donation limit] we now confront is vast in its reach. Thegovernment has muffle[d] the voices that best represent the most significantsegments of the economy.”27 [Notes.html#C3F27]Kennedy’s Darwinian definition discounts the fact that many Americans consideraverage families, firefighters, financial sector regulators, military personnel,teachers, nurses, and the like to best represent the “most significant segments”of the American economy, not plutocrats who buy legislators’ votes.As noted by Justice Stevens, the Roberts Republicans decriminalized vote buyingby conflating constitutional protections for speech content with its volume.Abruptly, money in support of politicians became protected speech. Chief JusticeRoberts asserted that the Court “must give the benefit of any doubt toprotecting rather than stifling speech.”28 [Notes.html#C3F28] This novelty wasreasserted in the Court’s subsequent ruling, McCutcheon v. Federal ElectionCommission (2014), which further eased limits on political giving. MillionaireShaun McCutcheon, the prevailing party in that suit, unintentionally if aptlydescribed the Roberts Republicans’ theology this way: “I would think everybodywould be for more money in politics like I am, because we’re just spreadingspeech.”29 [Notes.html#C3F29] And that theology was famously synthesized earlierin the Buckley era by the Ford administration solicitor general, Robert Bork:“money can sometimes be the equivalent of speech . . . money is a proxy forspeech.”30 [Notes.html#C3F30]Given the nearly two-century legal precedent criminalizing vote buying and thefear of the corrosive impact of pay-to-play by the founding fathers, theframers, and iconic conservatives such as Goldwater, those whom Kennedy andScalia viewed as “the most significant” Americans were doubtless agog at theirgood fortune with Buckley.Today, in other rich democracies, wealthy elites tend not to dominate governmentbecause voters and courts agree with the American founding fathers and framersthat vote buying corrodes democracy. Wealthy citizens in these other nationsenjoy stout constitutional minority protections against majoritarian rule. Butunlike in America, such minority protections do not include the right to bribelawmakers and buy favorable government policies.Globally, that makes America an outlier among the wealthy democracies, alongwith Mexico and Brazil, where half the legislature is under investigation forgraft or worse.31 [Notes.html#C3F31] However, even Brazil and Mexico outlawcorporate political donations.32 [Notes.html#C3F32] The United States issingular in its system of pay-to-play and its decriminalization of vote buyingby corporations. American CEOs are permitted to lavishly fund politicalfavorites using shareholder and investor money without permission. The onlyrecourse of disgruntled investors is to sell their shares.Santa Clara: Corporations Are People, Too. No, Really . . . Trust MeThe uniquely American ability of CEOs to tap corporate treasuries to bribelawmakers is rooted with one Roscoe Conkling. A powerful politician who narrowlylost the 1876 presidential nomination to Rutherford B. Hayes, Conkling was amongthe top two or three most influential Republicans of the day. In 1882 herepresented the rail baron Leland Stanford before the Waite Supreme Court in SanMateo v. Southern Pacific Railroad. Stanford was seeking to roll back localnuisance taxes on his holdings—specifically, property taxes imposed by San MateoCounty, California. Hoping to be rewarded with a large paycheck from a gratefulStanford, Conkling devised a strategy that included conjuring from thin air anexpansive concept of corporate personhood that, in a peculiar twist of Americanhistory, brought about Citizens United more than a century later.As a former Congressman, Conkling was uniquely positioned to make his case. Backin 1868, he had been an original member of the Congressional committee thatdebated and approved the Fourteenth Amendment. That amendment enshrined equalprotection and legal rights for Black males under the Constitution in the wakeof the Civil War. It was a pillar of Reconstruction, providing protectionsagainst their harassment by state and local officials. But Conkling hadsomething else entirely in mind, an audacious, contrived addendum to thatamendment. Conkling baldly asserted to the Waite Court that he and his committeecolleagues had also meant for the amendment to extend protections to the legalartifice of corporations. Bothersome discriminatory local taxes and otherregulations on railroads were thus unconstitutional. He knew Chief JusticeMorrison Waite and some of his Supreme Court colleagues would be sympatheticbecause they were former railroad attorneys.Conkling’s bogus claim of such intent by the drafters of the FourteenthAmendment was ludicrous. As constitutional historian Howard Jay Grahamexplained, “[t]his part of Conkling’s argument was a deliberate, brazenforgery.”33 [Notes.html#C3F33] Contemporaneous evidence was never offered tosupport Conkling’s assertion, because none existed. Indeed, the only proofoffered in 1882 by Conkling himself was his own spare, hand-written ruminations.A considerable body of US corporate jurisprudence had evolved by 1882, but nonegranted these artifices the legal rights enjoyed by persons of flesh and blood.The definitive published record of legislative action in 1868 duringdeliberations on the Fourteenth Amendment itself was called the CongressionalGlobe. It contained no reference even to a debate on granting personhood tocorporations, much less a Congressional or committee vote on such a profound andcontroversial—not to mention bizarre—extension of the Fourteenth Amendment. In aprofession that cherishes debate, minutiae, and records, none existed. AsUniversity of California Los Angeles law professor Adam Winkler wrote in 2012,“no independent evidence to support his claim has ever been uncovered.”34[Notes.html#C3F34]Conkling was untroubled by his factual vacuum because he knew his audience.Historian James MacGregor Burns explained events this way:There was little evidence to back up Conkling’s claim, but neither did anyonecontradict him—most of his colleagues on the framing committee were dead.35[Notes.html#C3F35] Americans might have mused that corporation heads packed the[Supreme] Court as much as presidents. Exerting their overpowering influence onthe White House and Congress, an astonishing number of railroads and otherindustries put their people on the Supreme Court. All of Grant’s appointees . .. including Chief Justice Waite were railroad attorneys.36 [Notes.html#C3F36]Presidents filled the Supreme Court with industry straw men to thank theirgrandest contributors. And the grandest of all were railroad proprietors. In theearly Gilded Age, railroads were the central American industry, consuming vastquantities of steel, men, and capital to connect far-flung America. It wastoday’s IT, auto, internet and aircraft sectors rolled into one spectacularlywealthy industry with irresistible political power to match. Malcolm Gladwellhas concluded that the second and fourth richest persons in all of human historyderived their wealth one way or another from the American railroads of this era:Andrew Carnegie and William H. Vanderbilt.37 [Notes.html#C3F37] Like mostbillionaires, they were economic Darwinians—and so were the justices appointedat their behest to the Waite and successor Fuller Supreme Courts.The Waite and Fuller Courts’ justices routinely favored powerful economicinterests while displaying hostility to human rights, to the emerging middleclass, or to labor rights. Appallingly, they even refused to apply theconstitutional protections explicitly provided in the Fourteenth Amendment toprevent the mayhem, hanging, and vote suppression by Southern state and localofficials that were rampant during the Jim Crow era. The Equal JusticeInitiative documented 4,075 lynchings through the 1940s, worse than one everyweek since the end of Reconstruction seventy years earlier.38 [Notes.html#C3F38]As events transpired, the personhood of corporations was not an issue in the SanMateo ruling. But the payoff for Conkling’s mendacity was realized in January1886 when the Waite court heard another Southern Pacific case, this oneinvolving taxes imposed by Santa Clara County. With no discussion, personhoodfor corporations entered into American statutes with the Santa Clara ruling.Without debate, Chief Justice Waite peremptorily asserted that he and hiscolleagues believed corporations to be “persons” like African-American men andthus were also covered by the Equal Protection Clause of the FourteenthAmendment. “We are all of the opinion that it does,” he concluded, credentialedsolely by Conkling’s spurious contention nearly four years earlier.39[Notes.html#C3F39]Corporate personhood is without precedent—it is immaculate jurisprudence. TheWaite Court’s unsolicited and undebated assertion of corporate personhood is notsupported by historical documents or prior jurisprudence. Silent Congressionalrecords belie Conkling. Indeed, that silence includes the voluminous debates bylegislators in the many states as they discussed ratification of the FourteenthAmendment in 1868. That silence included Conkling himself and every one of hisCongressional colleagues then or in the years thereafter. Political scientistHoward Jay Graham noted in the Yale Law Review in 1938 that what he rathergenerously labeled Conkling’s 1882 “misquotations” of the record “are difficultto reconcile . . . in view of the absence of corroborating statements by othermembers of the Joint Committee, and since Roscoe Conkling himself appears tohave said nothing publicly for sixteen years” until San Mateo.40[Notes.html#C3F40] Moreover, the chief drafter of the 1868 Equal ProtectionClause of the Fourteenth Amendment was committee member John Bingham from Ohio.He frequently discussed and interpreted the amendment in years following, evennoting in the Congressional Globe that it made the entire Bill of Rightsenforceable against the states on behalf of African-American men. Never a hintof corporate personhood from him, either.41 [Notes.html#C3F41]Indeed, the vacuous foundation of the Conkling/Waite corporate personhoodcontrivance is responsible for its dismissal by two of the most respectedtwentieth-century Supreme Court justices, William O. Douglas and Hugo Black.They concluded that there was a good reason why Bingham, Conkling, and all theothers involved in the Fourteenth Amendment neither wrote nor spoke regardinginclusion of corporations: because it simply was pure chicanery. Writing inWheeling Steel Corporation v. Glander (1949), they concluded: “There was nohistory, logic or reason given to support that view,” by the Waite court. “Therewas no suggestion in its submission [for states’ ratification] that it wasdesigned to put negroes and corporations into one class and so dilute the policepower of the states over corporate affairs.” Douglas and Black noted thatvarious Supreme Court justices of the era had even explicitly rejected corporatepersonhood.42 [Notes.html#C3F42]Finally, there is the actual language of the Fourteenth Amendment that makes itclear that only human beings are persons: “All persons born or naturalized inthe United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens . . .No state shall . . . deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, withoutdue process of law . . .” As Douglas and Black noted regarding Conkling’sassertion, “‘Persons’ in the first sentence plainly includes only human beings,for corporations are not ‘born or naturalized.’ Corporations are not ‘citizens’within the meaning of the first clause of the second sentence. It has never beenheld that they are persons whom a State may not deprive of life . . .” Moreover,Douglas and Black noted the antithetical reasoning it takes to construe that theamendment includes corporations: “It requires distortion to read ‘person’ asmeaning one thing, then another within the same clause and from clause to clause. . .”43 [Notes.html#C3F43] If corporate personhood had been created as Conklingaverred, it is simply the best-kept secret in all of American history.[images/line.jpg]* [Chapter03.html#rC3a]As used herein, “vote buying” does not refer tocandidates bribing voters.

Most of America’s richest individuals are highlyactive politically, and their vast resources give them a disproportionateinfluence on US politics. Harvard political scientists Vanessa Williamson andTheda Skocpol, the former president of the American Political ScienceAssociation, note thatWealth and income have become so amazingly unequal in the United States that afew hundred billionaire families have the means to push their own worldview incivic and political affairs . . . When it comes to setting agendas for publicdiscussion and policy debates—encouraging entire convoys of organizations oroffice holders to move in one direction or another—the super-duper wealthy inAmerica today can make quite a difference. At the very highest levels of wealthand disposable income, resources are so stupendous that the personal outlooks,even quirks, of the super-rich matter.”3 [Notes.html#C4F03]In 2012, for instance, 388 of the wealthiest Forbes 400 made politicalcontributions.4 [Notes.html#C4F04] Their agendas matter because their generosityhas come to dominate campaign contributions and political/issue advertising. In1980, the richest one-tenth of one percent (0.1 percent) of donors contributedless than 10 percent of all campaign contributions. In 2012, their share wasgreater than 44 percent.5 [Notes.html#C4F05] In 2016, their share reachedtwo-thirds of donations to Congressional candidates and it dominatedcontributions in hundreds of state contests.6 [Notes.html#C4F06] Their politicalpreferences matter because the “personal outlooks, even quirks” of thesepolitically active multimillionaires and billionaires are shared by few otherAmericans; as noted in chapter 2 [Chapter02.html], they are disdainful ofmiddle- and lower-class priorities. In this chapter, we’ll see how they haveadopted the GOP to implement their agenda. Even so, their agendas are souniquely self-serving that they are often at odds with the preferences of theirfellow Republican Party members.Affluent political donors have favored the Republican party since the GildedAge, transforming the party of Lincoln into a refuge for the privileged. Thatbias eased for a generation before Reagan during the postwar decades, whenmoderate Republicans ascended. Indeed, the party’s collaboration and cooperationwith Democrats were instrumental in the rise of the great American middle classand the resurrection of civil rights. Since Reagan, however, that trend hasdissipated; the Gilded Age bias has reappeared. That trend accelerated in theearly 1990s when Congressional Republicans sought political ascendency byformally adopting a pay-to-play strategy to lure wealthy donors. Both the GOP’sagenda and power and influence within the party itself were explicitly linked byformer Congressman Tom DeLay’s “K-Street Project” to servicing wealthy donors.This shift to transactional politics is evident in the evolution of GOP partyplatforms. In 1992, for example, the GOP had advocated limits on soft moneydonations and favored elimination of corporate and union PACs. But by 2004, ithad reversed course, deciding that any funding restrictions violated the FirstAmendment.7 [Notes.html#C4F07] To appease the donor class, GOP moderates had toaccept a small-government agenda that conflicted with their postwar support ofMedicare, capital gains taxes, and stronger public schools. Moderates beganabandoning the party. Others were culled from leadership positions in a processmanaged by officials including Newt Gingrich, or defeated in primaries.This shift to transactional politics has been rewarded by corporate America andby the fittest. Cornell University economist Jin-Hyuk Kim found that only twentyof the S&P 500 Index firms during the period 1998 to 2004 donated primarily orexclusively to Democrats while tenfold more (206) primarily or exclusivelycontributed to Republican lawmakers.8 [Notes.html#C4F08] Among the 200 bestcompensated CEOs in 2016, the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics notesthey gave $6.50 to the GOP for every dollar going to Democrats, “a clearpropensity to support Republicans.”9 [Notes.html#C4F09] Moreover, among thewealthy, some 158 families accounted for nearly half of all contributions to the2016 presidential race made during the critical money-primary season in 2015,with nearly all (138, or 87 percent) supporting Republicans.10[Notes.html#C4F10] Very few wealthy donors follow the lead of George Soros orenvironmental advocate Tom Steyer, who favor Democrats.The rightward shift with the departure of moderates is reflected in a PewResearch Center finding that the share of Republicans viewing government as an“enemy” increased nearly 60 percent between 1996 and 2015. By contrast, theshare of Democrats viewing it as an enemy changed little—and the share viewingit as a friend rose nearly 20 percent.11 [Notes.html#C4F11] An example of thistransformation is the issue of renewable energy that moderate Republicans suchas former Senator Chuck Percy of Illinois in the past supported. No longer.Beginning in 2010, the fittest led by the Koch brothers spent tens of millionsof dollars in primary contests on behalf of climate deniers. Their lobbyist TimPhillips explained the consequence: “After that, [renewable energy] disappearedfrom Republican ads. Part of that was the polling, and part of that was thevisceral example of what happened to their colleagues who had done that . . . Ittold the Republicans that we were serious, that we would spend some seriousmoney against them.”12 [Notes.html#C4F12]Culling of moderates from Republican ranks was important because it set thestage for the Tea Party. That, in turn, enabled opportunistic donors to undulyinfluence these staunchly conservative GOP grassroots that came to dominateparty primary elections and conventions.Tea Party Grassroots: The Donor Class’s Disproportionate Influence on the GOPUsing the formulation devised in 1982 by political economist Mancur Olsen (TheRise and Fall of Nations), the donor class has emerged as the pinnacle“distributional coalition” in American politics. Most of its members have farmore at stake than you or me from specific public policies, and thus are willingto spend mightily to influence those specific policies—think fossil fuelindustry moguls, hedge fund managers, or pharmaceutical firm CEOs. Most aresmall-government aficionados and some have spent years shaping public opinion,as Nancy MacLean detailed in Democracy in Chains (2017) or Jane Mayer of the NewYorker noted in 2016. Families like the Scaifes, Coors, Ricketts, and Kochs“were among a small rarefied group of hugely wealthy, archconservative familiesthat for decades poured money, often with little public exposure, intoinfluencing how the Americans thought and voted.”13 [Notes.html#C4F13]As 2009 unfolded, some of these activist donors seized the moment offered by theemergence of the Tea Party to rather dramatically increase their influencewithin the GOP, described here by Skocpol and Williamson:A vast network of policy-oriented right-wing intellectual organizations,generously funded, has been strategizing and writing for many years, awaitingthe moment when political and electoral winds might shift just enough, to allowtheir ideas to find a larger place on the mainstream agenda . . . Nationalorganizations, such as Freedom Works and Americans for Prosperity [bothbelonging to the Koch brothers], suddenly saw fresh opportunities to pushlong-standing ideas about reducing taxes on business and the rich, guttinggovernment regulations, and privatizing Social Security and Medicare.14[Notes.html#C4F14]By dint of wallet, wealthy donors began to dramatically enhance the reach ofthose social conservative GOP grassroots activists. The Kochs “were among theoriginal financiers of the Tea Party movement,” explain New York Timesjournalists Sheryl Gay Stolberg and Mike McIntire.15 [Notes.html#C4F15]Journalist Jurek Martin of the Financial Times adds: “It is the Kochs and theirilk who have fueled the Tea Party engine . . . Radical Washington institutionswith mellifluous and innocent-sounding names—Freedom Works, Americans forProsperity and the National Taxpayers Union—have thrived under theirlargesse.”16 [Notes.html#C4F16]Their support was matched by the conservative media mogul Rupert Murdoch, ownerof Fox News, who sought a niche to distinguish his network from the mainstreambroadcast behemoths ABC, CBS, and NBC. Commentator Frank Rich considersMurdoch’s March 2009 directive that his media empire publicize the Tea Party tobe as instrumental as Koch cash in its rise: “The Kochs surely match the in-kinddonations the Tea Party receives in free promotion 24/7 from Murdoch’s Fox News. . .” Fox has been a right-wing mouthpiece and echo chamber in the years since,routinely and more recently relentlessly peddling conspiracies and half-truthsthat observers today would term fake news. Here is New York Times journalistNick Corasaniti: “The network has provided a strategic path for Republicanpoliticians and candidates with a message: To raise an issue, set an agenda orchange the talk around a charged topic, go to Fox News.”17 [Notes.html#C4F17]Skocpol and Williamson explained the lure of Tea Partiers to the decidedlyupscale donor class:Alignment with Tea Party activists is the latest elite maneuver in the waragainst taxes and associated push to dismantle costly popular social programslike Medicare and Social Security . . . Now the anti-tax mantra would have somepopular oomph behind it, enthusiastic backing from the ranks of ordinarymiddle-class conservatives attending Tea Party rallies and meetings. Indeed theTea Party erupted at just the right moment to cut Obama and the Democrats off atthe pass in the never-ending war to reduce regulations on business and free theUS wealthy from having to pay taxes to sustain social supports for their fellowcitizens. That is how the situation looks to right-wing interests . . . GOPersloyal to ultra-right agendas can roll back government spending, smash unionsthat are politically aligned with Democrats, and—above all—block tax increaseson the privileged.18 [Notes.html#C4F18]Studying the mechanics of intraparty Republican politics in light of the rise ofthe Tea Party, the donor class quickly mastered its vulnerability: The departureof moderates had left staunch conservatives disproportionately influential inparty primaries. The Tea Party appellation has become unpopular even amongconservatives in recent years. Even so, Pew surveys have found that 49 percentof those who always vote in GOP primaries are self-identified Tea Partiers ortheir ideological mates. More than 50 percent who voted in the GOP 2012primaries were evangelicals.19 [Notes.html#C4F19] When combined with otherself-identified conservatives, right-wing voters have come to represent fully 75percent of those who always vote in GOP primaries.20 [Notes.html#C4F20]The donor class has magnified the rightward shift of the GOP by further cullingremaining moderates in recent election cycles. Journalist Joe Rothstein explainswhat occurred during 2010 in North Carolina: “James Arthur ‘Art’ Pope, [is] anextraordinarily wealthy North Carolina native who has invested tens of millionsof dollars in buying legislative and Congressional seats and as many statewideoffices as his fortune (mostly inherited) can buy.”21 [Notes.html#C4F21] Many ofthe eighteen moderate state senators and delegates across North Carolina sweptfrom office in 2010 by Pope’s cash were moderate Republicans. The process wasdescribed this way by one of the defeated: “They spent nearly a million dollarsto win . . . [my state Senate] seat. A lot of it was from corporations andoutside groups related to Art Pope. He was their sugar daddy.”22[Notes.html#C4F22]In 2012, Koch money helped defeat eight moderate Republican state senators inKansas primaries. In Arkansas, conservative donors spent millions of dollarsousting moderates in a state where politicians traditionally spent a fewthousand dollars, as noted by Democratic state Senator Robert Thompson inNovember 2012: “If any outside group comes in and spends $10,000, that’s a bigchunk of what the candidates are going to spend.”23 [Notes.html#C4F23]In Fighting For Common Ground, former Senator Olympia Snowe of Maine, a moderateRepublican, writes that her party’s grassroots with Tea Party sympathies hold“the most extreme views within our party . . . [seeking to] ‘purify’ it bydefeating moderates.”24 [Notes.html#C4F24] Her Congressional history ofcollaborating with Democrats attracted a chorus of boos at the state Republicanconvention in Bangor in early 2012, causing her to end her reelection bid.25[Notes.html#C4F25] Only in a few instances of overreach, such as Kansas governorSam Brownback in 2016, has the culling been reversed.Donor class spending pushed the GOP rightward even when their favored candidatesdidn’t prevail in primaries. The threat of an intraparty contest or a sizablenegative advertising buy can be enough. Senators Ron Wyden and Lisa Murkowski inDecember 2012 noted that Congressional voting “is often colored by the prospectof facing $5 million in anonymous attack ads if a member of Congress crosses aneconomically powerful interest.”26 [Notes.html#C4F26]Gerrymandering has also helped conservatives triumph over moderates, and as aresult a sizable number of general election outcomes are increasingly determinedby sparsely attended primaries in one-party legislative districts. Indeed,gerrymandering has caused the number of actual competitive elections forCongress to become minuscule: The Cook Report, for instance, found onlythirty-two races out of 435 in 2016 were decided by a margin of 10 percentagepoints or less, compared to at least 123 races in 1992, 1994, and 1996.27[Notes.html#C4F27] It is the same story in state elections. Some 71 percent ofcandidates in the November 2015 state election ran unopposed for the VirginiaHouse of Delegates, heavily gerrymandered by the GOP.28 [Notes.html#C4F28] Not asingle incumbent legislator was defeated. Careful to preserve their careers,those same legislators in mid-February 2017 vetoed placing a voter referendum onredistricting reform on the Virginia November 2017 ballot.29 [Notes.html#C4F29]These dark corners of American politics were conceived explicitly to strengthenone-party rule. The consequence is to facilitate the fittest agenda by enabling(immoderate) voters in primaries rather than in general elections to dictate whoserves in Congress.The Koch ApparatusA number of wealthy families such as the Mercers—part owners of the whitesupremacist website Breitbart—were important in the Trump and GOP victories in2016; the Adelsons alone donated more than $40 million to Donald Trump and theGOP. But the Koch brothers stand out for their heft, their skill as politicaltacticians, and the vast scope of their political activities, which equal orexceed the reach of the Republican Party itself. They have emerged as a highlyeffective and sophisticated third force in American politics alongside the twopolitical parties. Kenneth Vogel explained in Politico: “The Koch politicaloperation has become among the most dominant forces in American politics,rivaling even the official Republican Party in its ability to shape policydebates and elections.”30 [Notes.html#C4F30] In 2012, the Koch apparatus of fourhundred mega-donors spent about $400 million supporting the GOP—more than doublethe spending in opposition by the ten largest labor unions.31 [Notes.html#C4F31]Although they refused to contribute to the narcissistic Donald Trump, theymarshaled a reported $750 million during the 2016 election cycle to supportdown-ballot conservatives, funding 1,600 full time, year-round staff in 107offices across thirty-eight states.32 [Notes.html#C4F32] Their network has spentover $1.5 billion since the mid-2000s to identify and support conservativeRepublicans, with a preference for electable libertarians.33 [Notes.html#C4F33]Former Obama White House official Chris Lahane spelled it out: “[The Kochbrothers] have effectively acquired the Republican Party and repurposed it.”34[Notes.html#C4F34] Skocpol and Williamson explain that the goal of the Kochs andother conservative moguls is to “remake the Republican Party into a disciplined,uncompromising machine devoted to radical free-market goals.”35[Notes.html#C4F35] The income bias, the attacks on Obamacare, tax cuts,deregulation of environmental and labor rules, and the decline in the share ofGDP attributed to government spending are evidence that these billionaires havelargely succeeded in seizing the agenda of the GOP. Certainly, many thoughtfulRepublicans believe they have, including the commentator Ross Douthat whoacknowledges that “the party’s basic orientation . . . [has become] a tool ofmoneyed interests.”36 [Notes.html#C4F36]A prediction made by commentator Frank Rich in 2010 has been realized: “Yet,inexorably the Koch agenda is morphing into the GOP agenda, as articulated bycurrent Republican members of Congress . . . Their program opposes a federaldeficit, but has no objection to running up trillions in red ink in tax cuts forcorporations and the superrich . . . [while it] opposes the extension ofunemployment benefits . . .”37 [Notes.html#C4F37]The Fittest FiftyNot all Republicans or even all conservatives are pleased with this turn ofevents. South Carolina GOP Senator Lindsey Graham in April 2015 lamented therole being played by a few dozen wealthy donors in his state’s presidentialprimary, arguing, “basically fifty people are running the entire show.”38[Notes.html#C4F38]In honor of social Darwinians such as William Graham Sumner, the conservativedonor class is henceforth in this book referred to as the fittest fifty. A closecontender was the fittest 100 because the Center for Responsive Politics foundthat the top 1 percent of Super PAC contributors in 2012 were responsible fortwo-thirds of their donations. That is a universe of about one hundred peopleand their spouses.39 [Notes.html#C4F39] Also considered was the fittest 195,because the Brennan Center for Justice noted in 2016 that about 60 percent ofthe $1 billion in campaign spending channeled through super PACs in the fiveyears since Citizens United had come from 195 people.40 [Notes.html#C4F40]Pin Money“It’s just one quarter’s dividend.” That’s how billionaire hedge fund managerBill Ackman described the relatively trivial cost of funding a politicalcampaign, even for a presidential primary aspirant.41 [Notes.html#C4F41] Readyexamples include Bill Marriott’s support of Mitt Romney; Foster Friess and RickSantorum; Harold Simons and Rick Perry; Norman Braman and Marco Rubio; RobertMercer, the Wilks brothers, and Ted Cruz. The list grows longer with eachelection.A candidate’s political appeal, stage-presence, and campaign organization arevital elements in a competitive political contest, but so is money. That makesthe fittest fifty indispensable to aspiring politicians in both parties—rareexceptions being aspirants such as Dr. Ben Carson, Donald Trump, or BernieSanders who mobilized small donors. Controversial or prominent figures such asTrump, who are able to garner massive free media exposure, are also less relianton the fittest fifty. Indeed, MediaQuant concluded that Donald Trump benefitedfrom an astounding $4.6 billion in free cable and broadcast coverage during2016, garnering considerably more exposure than Secretary Clinton.42[Notes.html#C4F42] Even so, Trump received lavish donations frommultimillionaires and billionaires Sheldon Adelson, Ronald Cameron, Betsy DeVos,Harold Hamm, Bernard Marcus, Rebekah Mercer, Linda McMahon, Steven Mnuchin,Wilbur Ross, Anthony Scaramucci, and Peter Thiel, among others.43[Notes.html#C4F43]At the presidential level in November, the breadth of popular support for majorcandidates neutralizes any advantage of political money, as noted by researcherssuch as Thomas Frank, Jane Mayer, and journalists like Steven Pearlstein andE.J. Dionne Jr.44 [Notes.html#C4F44] However, that parity disappears when itcomes to down-ballot races. Support from the fittest fifty has been instrumentalto the success in recent years of the GOP at the state level, especially duringoff-year elections. A very modest dump of campaign cash by nationalstandards—$10 million or $20 million—has proved sufficient for quick-wittedlocal conservatives to capture entire state governments. In fact, well-fundedRepublicans captured a near-majority of state governments in 2010, building ongrassroots energized by criticism of big government, Democratic elitism, andObamacare. That brought control of the 2011 redistricting process in thosestates, with the resulting gerrymandering enabling Republicans to solidify theirhold on the House of Representatives.Low turnout and frustration with Democrats were powerful factors in theRepublican ascendency beginning with the 2010 election. But donations fromconservatives unleashed by the Supreme Court’s Citizens United ruling in January2010 were also important. Kenneth Vogel explained its impact this way: “Itchanged the mind-set of big donors and big-money operatives. Perhaps moreimportantly, it introduced the idea that a single ultra-donor, or awell-connected consultant with the ears of a handful of mega-donors, couldfundamentally shift a campaign for the US presidency, not to mention a handfulof Senate or governors’ races or dozens of House seats.”45 [Notes.html#C4F45]The centrality of Citizens United to this political success is confirmed by anelaborate analysis by Tilman Klumpp, Hugo Mialon, and Michael Williams. Theyexamined the ruling’s specific impact, utilizing as a control group those statesthat had previously prohibited corporate political spending. They concluded thatnew corporate contributions to GOP candidates in state-level races in 2010 and2012 increased the Republicans’ odds of winning individual elections by anaverage of 4 percentage points. Their findings drew on data from 29,698 stateHouse races and 8,517 state Senate races in forty-nine states. Importantly, inthe swing states of Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, and Ohio (plus the redstates of Montana and Tennessee), GOP odds improved by a minimum of 10percentage points. And they increased by 7 percentage points in Texas, Colorado,Iowa, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. Moreover, Citizens United was found to reduce thenumber of citizens donating to campaigns. It also reduced the number ofcandidates willing to run as Democrats.46 [Notes.html#C4F46]The hundreds of millions of dollars contributed to this and more recent GOPelectoral successes did not jeopardize fortunes of the fittest fifty. An extremeexample is the casino owners Miriam and Sheldon Adelson. Their contributions andpolitical/issue advertising in 2012 alone was greater than the combinedcontributions from all donors in twelve of the smaller states like Delaware,Idaho, and Maine.47 [Notes.html#C4F47] They squandered some $91.8 millionboosting Newt Gingrich and others during the 2012 election cycle,48[Notes.html#C4F48] yet their wealth increased by $14.4 billion in 2013.49[Notes.html#C4F49] Most US billionaires were lukewarm to candidate Trump in2016, but spent lavishly on behalf of other candidates. Even so, like theAdelsons, the aggregate wealth of American billionaires in 2016 increased (atotal rise of $77 billion according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index) farbeyond their outlays.50 [Notes.html#C4F50]It’s just pin money. The Wiktionary defines pin money as “an amount notparticularly significant . . . for routine expenses or incidentals.” You know,cash spent on whatnots—including the wardrobe pins for Henry VIII’s wives. TheKochs spent less than 1 percent of their fortune in the 2016 election cycle.Chicago hedge fund billionaire Kenneth Griffin spent more money on the Raunerrace for Illinois governor than every member of 244 labor unions.51[Notes.html#C4F51] He can afford it because his after-tax income is $68.5million a month.52 [Notes.html#C4F52] None of these billionaire donors is lesswealthy after their contributions; they remain as rich as Croesus. Just pinmoney. The process at work is explained by French economist Thomas Piketty,noting that size effects enable even the most extravagant to live well on a tinyportion of their income, the balance saved and reinvested to grow even more.53[Notes.html#C4F53] That process is exemplified by a handful of Florentinefamilies who have managed to sustain wealth since 1427. Four of the fivefamilies with the highest incomes in 2014 were in the top 3 percent of earnersthere in 1427, according to research by Guglielmo Barone and Sauro Mocetti:“Those who earn the most among current taxpayers were already at the top of thesocioeconomic ladder there six centuries ago.”54 [Notes.html#C4F54]I Pledge Allegiance to the Fittest FiftyAdopting the fittest fifty agenda has transformed Republicans to be the firstuniformly conservative party in American history. GOP lawmakers are certainlysubject to other powerful influences in crafting policy, including tightlyfocused and organized interest groups such as the gun lobby, right-to-lifeadvocates, the Chamber of Commerce, staunch conservatives such as the FreedomCaucus, and the like. But when it comes to economics, the income bias documentsthat shrewd GOP lawmakers have adopted the fittest fifty agenda of smallgovernment and wage suppression as their own. Maintaining this fealty has beenawkward at times. In 2017, most Congressional Republicans sought to strip healthinsurance from twenty million working-class Americans to fund $300 billion intax cuts for the fittest. And on global warming since 2010, they have beenrequired to suspend reason, evidence, and critical thinking to avoid offendingthe Koch brothers. The New York Times investigative reporters Carol Davenportand Eric Lipton explain: “Koch Industries and Americans for Prosperity startedan all-fronts campaign with television advertising, social media andcrosscountry events aimed at electing lawmakers who would ensure that the fossilfuel industry would not have to worry about new pollution regulations.”55[Notes.html#C4F55]Put differently, timorous Republican lawmakers since 2010 have urged voters toignore the ocean lapping at living rooms in Miami and Norfolk—move on, nothingto see here! As Stuart Stevens, a GOP strategist, acknowledges, “the RepublicanParty has greatly changed.”56 [Notes.html#C4F56]Mann and Ornstein argue that the GOP has been tarnished by its pursuit of thefittest fifty agenda they described as an “unabashed ambition to reverse decadesof economic and social policy by any means.”57 [Notes.html#C4F57] Their tactics(reliance on a drumbeat of fake news, polarizing voters, and shutting down thegovernment twice, for instance) are indicative of a political party that hasfallen out of the historic American political mainstream: “It is as if one ofthe many paranoid fringe movements in American political history hassuccessfully infected a major political party . . . What used to be seen asloony is now broadly accepted or tolerated.”58 [Notes.html#C4F58]Falling unduly under the spell of the fittest fifty has also placed the GOP wellon the fringe among all political parties in the higher quality democracies. In2012, Paul Quinn, a legislator from the conservative New Zealand National Party,explained the consequences to visiting American Fulbright scholars: “I willexplain to you how our system works compared to yours: You have Democrats andRepublicans. My Labor opponents would be Democrats. I am a member of theNational Party, and we would be . . . Democrats as well.”59 [Notes.html#C4F59]Moreover, pursuit of the fittest fifty agenda represents a de facto disavowal ofthe Republicans’ Lincolnian roots as the party of opportunity for averageAmericans. That is particularly evident in Republican Party support of wagesuppression. Indeed, the fittest fifty and executive suites have made theadvocacy of higher wages a third rail of internal Republican Party politics. GOPlawmakers have logically responded by opposing higher minimum wage laws,independent contractor reforms, collective bargaining, overtime pay reform, paidparental leave, or preventing wage theft through stricter enforcement of wageand overtime regulations. Hostility to these pillars of middle-class prosperityis a bizarre position for any political party in a democracy, but flowsnaturally from the GOP’s allegiance to the fittest fifty.GOP Lawmakers Prioritize the Fittest Fifty Agenda Over Party FaithfulFinally, adoption of the fittest fifty agenda has caused GOP lawmakers to ignorethe major economic policy preferences of party grassroots beyond just higherwages. The results of a CBS/New York Times survey from 2015 are informative:Some 85 percent of Americans, including 77 percent of Republicans, supportrequiring corporations and other employers to provide paid sick leave foremployees, for instance (chart 4.1). Similar proportions of GOP party membersalso support paid parental leave and raising taxes to buttress SocialSecurity—policy preferences studiously ignored by Republican lawmakers.The disconnect between the preferences of the GOP grassroots and party lawmakershas forced the latter to adopt a bait-and-switch strategy. Action on hot-buttonissues such as Obamacare, traditional marriage, or abortion rights has beenpromised. But progress has been fitful even in 2017 with the GOP in full controlof the federal government. (Conservative intellectuals such as Ross Douthatargued that the party is burdened by a weak, uninformed, erratic, anddisinterested President.)60 [Notes.html#C4F60] In quite sharp contrast, thefittest fifty agenda of wage stagnation, deregulation, and tax cuts has beenquite successfully pursued by GOP lawmakers. This allegiance to elite donors isespecially evident on fortifying the legalities of pay-to-play, exemplified bythe Senate Republicans’ refusal during 2016 to even consider the Obamanomination of Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court. Democratic SenatorJeff Merkley explains: “The thing the Republican leadership feared most was thatan Obama [Supreme Court] nominee would rule against the huge influx of ‘dark’money into political campaigns that is corrupting our system of government. Theyfeared this outcome more than any other because it is that dark money, a vastamount of which came from the Koch brothers and their organization, that hasplayed a huge role in putting the Republicans in the Senate majority.”61[Notes.html#C4F61][images/pg80.jpg]Chart 4.1 Share of respondents favoring noted policy. CBS News/New York Timessurvey (paid leave, tax on million-dollar incomes) and National Academy ofSocial Insurance (Social Security), 2012.Noam Scheiber and Dalia Sussman, “Inequality Troubles Americans Across PartyLines, a Poll Finds,” New York Times, June 4, 2015; and Harold Meyerson, “TheNext Debate Topic,” Washington Post, August 27, 2015.Pursuing policy outcomes in disagreement with majoritarian economic preferencesand their own grassroots has positioned the contemporary Republican Party wellout of the American mainstream. Even so, this pattern may persist for many yearsuntil a progressive Supreme Court recriminalizes vote buying, thereby providingthe freedom for lawmakers to end the income bias if they choose. Thateventuality is the focus of section 2 [Part02.html]."},{"pageContent":"SECTION 2 [Contents.html#SEC02][images/common.jpg]Reducing the Role of Money to Improve the Quality of American Democracy[Contents.html#SEC02a]THE BUCKLEY GENRE HAS lowered the quality of American democracy, placing wealthyconservative families at the center of American politics.

Here is David Cay Johnstonreflecting on the Buckley era: “The system today is not promoting prosperitybased on individual enterprise and thriftiness.

Posner, March 2016There’s just such a control of government by the wealthy that whatever happens,it’s not working for all the people; it’s working for a few of the people.2[Notes.html#C5F02]—Stanley Greenberg, Pollster, August 2011THE RISE OF THE fittest fifty is rooted in an unprecedented partisan divide onthe Supreme Court. Beginning with the Burger Court, justices appointed byRepublican presidents have outvoted mostly Democratic appointees to rulerepeatedly in suits involving the political system in favor of William GrahamSumner’s fittest. The preferences of higher income Americans, financiers, andCEOs have always been important to public officials. Many are employers,entrepreneurs, and community leaders who can create jobs. They are traditionallyimportant cogs in society, and their concerns warrant attention. But a cultlikedevotion to the fittest among justices has come to characterize the Buckley era.Ideological divides within the Supreme Court aren’t new. But law professors NealDevins of William & Mary, Lawrence Baum of Ohio State University, and RichardHasen of the University of California, Irvine, document that the Roberts Court’spartisan split is unprecedented.3 [Notes.html#C5F03] Its Republican appointeeshave proven far more eager than Democratic appointees to accommodate the GOP’sallies in moneyed circles, especially after Justice Samuel Alito replaced thecentrist Justice O’Connor in 2006. Jeffrey Rosen writing in the New York TimesMagazine in March 2008 concluded that the ensuing partisan divide “was noaccident. It represents the culmination of a carefully planned,behind-the-scenes campaign over several decades to change not only the courtsbut also the country’s political culture.”4 [Notes.html#C5F04] A wide partisangap now separates Democratic and Republican justices on the key issues of votingrights and pay-to-play that bear directly on the equality and the sovereignty ofvoters and thus the quality of American democracy. The 2017 appointment ofJustice Neil Gorsuch ensures that the Roberts Republicans can muster majoritiesto continue cosseting the already comfortable by disenfranchising Democraticvoters and continuing to legitimize political bribery.A judicial partisan divide is widely acknowledged. “Today’s Republicans areessentially saying the court is nothing but another political body,” is how aNew York Times editorial described it.5 [Notes.html#C5F05] The increasinglypolitical nature of Federal courts is exemplified by the refusal of GOP senatorsto consider the nomination of Merrick Garland or numerous other Obama judicialnominees once they regained a majority in the 2014 elections. Republicansenators confirmed only 28 percent of judicial nominees during the last twoyears of the Obama administration. That provided President Trump with well overone hundred federal judgeships to fill upon taking office, sufficient to notablytilt federal courts to the right.6 [Notes.html#C5F06] In contrast, 67 percent ofGeorge W. Bush appointees in his last two years were confirmed by thethen-Democratic majority in the senate, leaving Barack Obama with onlyfifty-three vacancies to fill.7 [Notes.html#C5F07] Between vacancies andmandatory retirements, President Trump is likely to appoint nearly one-half ofappellate seats by 2020, the powerful courts immediately below the Supreme Courtthat decide thousands of cases annually.8 [Notes.html#C5F08] That prospectgreatly pleases Google, Chevron, and the fittest fifty—including the Scaifefamily foundation, Sheldon Adelson, the Kochs, and the Mercers—who have donatedtens of millions of dollars to the Federalist Society and the Judicial CrisisNetwork managing this methodical and successful transformation to a partisanRepublican Federal judiciary.The transformation has succeeded, as noted earlier, because majorities of theBurger, Rehnquist, and Roberts courts accountable for the Buckley genre haveignored nearly two centuries of precedent. Their logic perhaps draws from thesentiments of conservatives such as Ed Whelan. He is president of the Ethics andPublic Policy Center that provided guidance to Republican senators who refusedto debate or vote during 2016 on Merrick Garland. Whelan argues that adherenceto original intent needs to be situationally rejected, that is, “supplemented .. . when that methodology fails to yield a sufficiently clear answer to aconstitutional question.”9 [Notes.html#C5F09]The leading American conservative jurist and retired federal appeals court JudgeRichard Posner has argued that such malleable principles have tarred the RobertsCourt in particular as “a politicized court, which is to say a court stronglyinfluenced in making its decisions by the political beliefs of the judges.”10[Notes.html#C5F10] The late Justice Scalia, for instance, asserted “originalism”as justification for his refusal to recognize new rights for Americans such asmarriage equality. Yet, his perception of originalism was sufficiently malleableto extend religious rights to corporations, to permit corporations to buylegislators’ votes, and to permit GOP officials to shrink Black voting rightsdespite the Fourteenth Amendment.Chief Justice Roberts objects to Posner, insisting any partisan bias of hiscourt is merely impressionistic, colored by the increasingly politicizedconfirmation process: “Judges are not politicians, even when they come to thebench by way of the ballot.”11 [Notes.html#C5F11] This assertion is belied by anumber of rulings by Roberts Republicans that constitutionally embraced statelaws that disproportionately suppress the votes of Democrats. Crawford v. MarionCounty, Indiana Election Board in 2008 shielded spurious voter ID laws, whileShelby County v. Holder in 2013 weakened the Voting Rights Act.The Roberts Court’s Embrace of Democratic Voter SuppressionVoter purges and voter ID laws imposed by Republican state election officials inthe wake of Crawford reduced the Black and Latino franchises in nearly everySouthern state (and others like Iowa, Kansas, and Wisconsin), creating thegreatest suppression of minority voters since Jim Crow. That is why Posner hasconcluded that Crawford is “[w]idely regarded as a means of voter suppressionrather than of fraud prevention.”12 [Notes.html#C5F12] In Texas, for instance,Crawford permitted GOP state officials to reinstall de facto poll taxes withrules burdening some voters with the need to travel hundreds of miles to obtainnewly demanded IDs. The potential disenfranchisement is huge: a federal court inTexas found that 608,470 registered voters lacked the IDs that Crawfordrequired.13 [Notes.html#C5F13] They tend to be poor, elderly, and minorities whovote disproportionately for Democrats.In Iowa, new voter ID laws enacted by GOP officials in 2017 potentially exclude11 percent (260,000) of eligible voters. As elsewhere, minority voters trendingDemocratic were targeted. In Blackhawk County (Waterloo), for instance, Blackscomprise 27 percent of eligible voters without requisite IDs, but comprise only10 percent of county eligible voters. The GOP also eliminated same dayregistration and the ballot option of party-line voting despite acknowledgingthat voter fraud was nonexistent: Not one case of voter impersonation occurredamong the 1.6 million votes cast in 2016, for instance.14 [Notes.html#C5F14]These suppression tactics proved highly effective. Voter turnout rose 1.3percent from 2012 to 2016 in states not imposing voter ID restrictions. Incontrast, turnout in states including, Mississippi, Texas, Virginia, andWisconsin that imposed new voter ID laws in the wake of Crawford and Shelby fell1.7 percent. Moreover, these suppression laws proved to be artfully crafted,disenfranchisement falling most heavily among minorities leaning Democratic.Turnout in counties where Blacks comprised up to 40 percent of voters rose 0.8percent in 2016 in states without voter ID restrictions. In contrast, turnout insuch counties in states with new voter ID laws fell 2.5 percent in 2016. Thedrop was an even larger 5 percent in counties with new ID laws where Blackscomprised more than 40 percent of voters.15 [Notes.html#C5F15] In Wisconsin,state voter ID restrictions by Republican lawmakers contributed to a 41,000 dropin turnout between 2012 and 2016 in mostly minority Milwaukee. Statewide, astudy by Priorities USA found that turnout dropped by 200,000.16[Notes.html#C5F16] That almost certainly flipped the state to Donald Trump in2016, whose winning margin was just 22,748. It is reminiscent of Gore-Bush in2000. While the Supreme Court famously and inappropriately stopped the Floridarecount, that count was only necessary because 12,000 predominantly Black votershad been erroneously purged by Republican officials.17 [Notes.html#C5F17]Crawford and the Buckley genre share a disregard by Republican Supreme Courtjurists of prior jurisprudence or sustentative law, an absence of factualgrounding, and a justification in each instance by the introduction of novellegal arguments lacking underpinning in established legal doctrine.In Citizens United, for instance, the Roberts Republicans could not cite asingle precedent involving First Amendment speech rights of for-profitcorporations.18 [Notes.html#C5F18] Not one. In its Buckley genre rulings, theBurger, Rehnquist, and Roberts courts could not cite a single precedent in thecanons of American law where vote buying had previously been constitutionallyshielded or decriminalized. Not one. And in Crawford, the Roberts Republicanscould not identify one instance of voter identity fraud in the entire history ofIndiana. Not one.In-person voter fraud is virtually nonexistent, an awkward fact for RobertsRepublicans.19 [Notes.html#C5F19] Their insistence that state officials enactingvoter ID laws are nonetheless meeting the spirit and letter of the Constitutionwould have made the nineteenth-century Justice Joseph McKenna proud (read on).Of course, the Buckley genre is not the first skein of Supreme Court rulingsembracing voter inequality grounded in contrived, dubious, or fallacious legalthinking. The Jim Crow era of Supreme Court decisions stripping constitutionalprotections for Black Americans began with the Slaughterhouse ruling in 1873.Justice John Marshall Harlan later charged that his predecessors favoring JimCrow utilized sham legal reasoning to justify this and subsequent rulingsweakening the Fourteenth Amendment.20 [Notes.html#C5F20] Similarly, the RobertsRepublicans’ support for sham voter ID laws in Crawford rather precisely mimicsthe Fuller Court’s Williams v. Mississippi (1898) ruling; it held that electionofficials in Mississippi were not attempting to disenfranchise its 907,000 Blackvoters with literacy tests. Justice Joseph McKenna’s majority opinion at thetime asserted: “The constitution of Mississippi and its statutes do not on theirface discriminate between the races, and it has not been shown that their actualadministration was evil; only that evil was possible under them.”21[Notes.html#C5F21] Justice McKenna and the Fuller Court’s writ included Alabama,where delighted elites rushed to draft a new 1901 constitution to ensure “whitesupremacy in this state . . . [against the] menace of Negro domination.” Itbarred voting by anyone convicted of crimes involving “moral turpitude”—thedefinition of that term was left to local voting registrars.22[Notes.html#C5F22] And it included Louisiana where only 1,700 out of 700,000eligible Blacks were permitted to vote in 1900; by 1904, only 1,342 were evenallowed to register.23 [Notes.html#C5F23] Much of Justice McKenna’s opinionstood as writ on Black (and immigrant) voting rights until the 1960s.How evil was the Fuller Court’s writ? Most telling is that Adolph Hitler soughtto normalize the racist Nazi Nuremberg Laws that presaged the Holocaust byanalogizing them with the Jim Crow era, including its weekly lynchings. As Yalelaw professor James Whitman has noted, Mein Kampf lauds Jim Crow. And Nazipropagandists later touted to Germans the precedent of America’s “racistpolitics and policies . . . [featuring] special laws directed against theNegroes, which limit their voting rights, freedom of movement and careerpossibilities.” Whitman quotes one Nazi who wrote, “What is lynch justice, ifnot the natural resistance of the Volk to an alien race that is attempting togain the upper hand?”24 [Notes.html#C5F24]The pernicious Crawford and Shelby County rulings have compromised the RobertsCourt’s prestige and authority. Their ancestry is the poisonous tree of theracist Williams ruling. All three decisions empowered discrimination amongvoters by partisan state electoral officials. Adding to their discomfiture is afailure to remove the last vestiges of Jim Crow. The Roberts Republicans permitthe disenfranchisement of Democratic-leaning citizens in states like Alabamawhere 20 percent of Blacks are denied the vote as felons, many convicted fornoncrimes including—yes, moral turpitude.25 [Notes.html#C5F25] The consequenceis dramatized by Virginia Democratic Governor Terry McAuliffe who—despiteapoplectic Republican lawmakers—restored voting rights to 156,000 former felonsin recent years, helping turn a red state purple.26 [Notes.html#C5F26]University of Texas law professor Justin Driver summarizes: “An undesirableconsequence of the court’s partisan divide is that it becomes increasinglydifficult to contend with a straight face that constitutional law is not simplypolitics by other means, and that justices are not merely politicians clad infine robes.”27 [Notes.html#C5F27]Indeed, Supreme Court reporter Robert Barnes notes that virtually all SupremeCourt justices of late are the product of a highly politicized process: “Thething that separates all the smart lawyers who would like to become federaljudges from the ones who actually become Party as asserted by Abrahamjudges ismost often political connections. Involvement in ideological causes, politicalcampaigns and conservative or liberal organizations acts as a sieve. Itseparates out those who are chosen by the political elite for lifetimeappointments.”28 [Notes.html#C5F28]The Roberts Republicans Embrace the FittestThe court’s partisan divide has been documented by legal journalist Adam Liptakof the New York Times. Over the long sweep of American history, only two of the382 most important court rulings between 1790 and 2010 broke along party lines.Since 2010, however, at least seven such important rulings have broken alongpartisan lines, including rulings on voting rights, campaign finance, mandatory(customer, client, and patient) arbitration, immigration, and strip searches.29[Notes.html#C5F29] That partisan divide has since expanded to also include unionagency fees in Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association (2016).Partisanship is also evident in Roberts Republican rulings involving majoreconomic interests, corporate behavior, or clashes between economically upscaleand downscale citizens. As summarized by David Cay Johnson in his book FreeLunch, the Roberts Republicans take from the many to cosset the few, whilestripping grievances voiced by the many of judicial standing.30[Notes.html#C5F30]A landmark 2013 statistical analysis by professors Lee Epstein, William Landes,and Judge Posner examined votes by the thirty-six Supreme Court justices who hadserved during the prior sixty-five years. The five Republican appointees sittingon the Roberts court in 2013 were among the ten justices during that periodwhose rulings most closely hewed to business positions. And the two mostobsequious of all thirty-six justices are Roberts and Alito.31[Notes.html#C5F31] Judge Neil Gorsuch will very likely make a triumvirate. TheRoberts Republicans have rejected the founding principle of their RepublicanParty as asserted by Abraham Lincoln in 1859: “Labor is prior to, andindependent of capital . . . Capital could never have existed without labor . .. labor is the superior—greatly the superior—of capital.”32 [Notes.html#C5F32]Specific examples abound. Roberts Republicans have ruled that corporateofficials need not obtain shareholder approval for corporate political donations(Knox v. Service Employees International Union, Local 1000). Yet, unionofficials are required to obtain prior approval of political donations from eachindividual member. Interestingly, this right for CEOs to divert investor orshareholder money to ingratiate and gain political access is viewed askance bymany in the American business community itself. A 2012 survey of that sector bythe Corporate Reform Coalition found 71 percent of respondents supportedrequiring firms to “only spend money on political campaigns if they get approvalfrom their shareholders first.”33 [Notes.html#C5F33] The same proportion ofself-identified Republican respondents agreed.Other Roberts Court rulings favoring the fittest include: • Gross v. FBL Financial Services (2009)—Firms are largely imperviousto age discrimination lawsuits.34 [Notes.html#C5F34] • Walmart v. Dukes (2011) and AT&T Mobility v. Concepcion(2011)—Corporations are permitted to restrict access to the courts by aggrievedcustomers, patients, or employees, instead insisting on arbitration. That is,firms can sue employees, patients, clients, and customers in court, butsimultaneously force those possibly victimized by corporate actions intoarbitration, blocking their access to the justice system for class actionsuits.35 [Notes.html#C5F35] In the year following these rulings, there was adoubling of firms banning class action lawsuits in their user agreements withemployees, customers, and others.36 [Notes.html#C5F36] • Janus Capital Group v. First Derivative Traders (2011)—Immaculatefraud. Use of a shell entity by mutual funds prevents prosecution of the fundsfor defrauding clients (by completing some buy-or-sell-orders on behalf offavored clients at the expense of other clients).37 [Notes.html#C5F37] • Comcast v. Behrend (2013)—Comcast was shielded from prosecution forovercharging its Philadelphia customers by $875 million.38 [Notes.html#C5F38] • RJR Nabisco Inc. v. The European Community (2016)—Tobacco firmssmuggling cigarettes to Europe and participating in international moneylaundering enterprises cannot be sued by European nations or the EuropeanCommunity.39 [Notes.html#C5F39]As the scope of these rulings indicates, the Roberts Republicans have been quiteenergetic in providing a broad constitutional shield for the actions of thefittest fifty and corporations. That reflects in part the fruits of a deft legalstratagem pursued by a variety of private attorneys funded by the fittest fifty.Led by corporate enthusiasts such as James Bopp Jr., a host of Republican groupshave become serial filers of lawsuits cosseting the powerful, many allegingviolation of ephemeral or mythical corporate First Amendment rights. Their modelis to run suits en masse past the Roberts Republicans to see what sticks, courtconservatives opportunistically picking and choosing cases to hear.The Roberts Republicans have also been proactive on their own initiative. Mostnotably, they demanded an unusual reargument of the initial March 2009 CitizensUnited case in order to justify their eventual ruling that went considerablybeyond the original complaint. As former Justice John Paul Stevens explained:“Five justices were unhappy with the limited nature of the case before us, sothey changed the case to give themselves an opportunity to change the law.”40[Notes.html#C5F40][images/star.jpg]Exemplified by Crawford and the Buckley genre, rulings that have transformed thearchitecture of American politics have been instituted by Republican jurists ona foundation of sand. In the fullness of time, they are likely to be reversed.Just ask the CEO of Dow Chemical. Shortly after the death of Justice Scalia,that firm abruptly paid $835 million to settle a long-standing price-fixingconviction in a class action suit. Until then, they had every reason to believethe Roberts Republicans would intervene and overturn the Appeals Court verdictagainst them—just as they had done in other similar instances.41[Notes.html#C5F41]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 6 [Contents.html#CH06][images/common.jpg]Rejection of Political Equality by the Constitution [Contents.html#CH06a]The Constitution was designed to reverse the democratic trajectory of Americanpolitics.1 [Notes.html#C6F01]—Historian Matthew C. Simpson, September 2016Jefferson saw that Hamiltonianism would concentrate power in the hands of thebusiness leaders and financiers that it primarily served, leading inevitably toan American plutocracy . . . Jefferson’s fears were not misplaced. In modernAmerica, concentrated wealth controls politics and government.2[Notes.html#C6F02]—Historian John Ferling, Jefferson and HamiltonBEGINNING IN ANCIENT ATHENS, philosophers pondered the contours of a democraticrepublic. The ideal that emerged was self-government by citizens who enjoypolitical equality—equal influence—and voter sovereignty—elected representativeswho enact policies that accurately reflect popular preferences. Attaining suchequality, featuring rule by Aristotle’s “unpropertied,” came to be understood byJean-Jacques Rousseau, John Locke, Charles-Louis Montesquieu, and otherpolitical philosophers as the quintessential feature of a representativedemocracy. More than a decade before the American Revolution in 1762, Rousseauhad concluded that a self-governing democracy within a republic structure isdependent on public opinion being fairly heard because that “is the generalwill; and the will must speak itself or it does not exist . . .”3[Notes.html#C6F03] Rousseau argued that when a nation’s public opinion is notfairly heard, or when representatives substitute their own judgment for publicsentiment in crafting policy outcomes, that nation fails the test of being aself-governing democracy. Representatives must both hear and heed citizens asequals.The founding fathers certainly reached the same conclusion in 1776, as reflectedin their preamble to the Declaration of Independence. Yet in 1787 atPhiladelphia, the framers rejected political sovereignty and equality,diminishing their moment in history. The further rejection of political equalitythat emerged during the Buckley era was simply part of a pattern established incolonial times in which America’s leaders cosseted the comfortable at theexpense of Sumner’s unfit.Another of the founding fathers’ revolutionary ideals fared much better—thehistorically unprecedented expansion of the franchise noted earlier. Many of thefounders also sought the abolition of slavery, as Heritage Foundation historianMatthew Spalding notes: “In the wake of independence, state after state passedlegislation restricting or banning the institution.”4 [Notes.html#C6F04] InMassachusetts, for example, the soaring language of the Declaration ofIndependence reproduced in the state constitution was the explicit judicialfoundation for its 1783 abolition of slavery.5 [Notes.html#C6F05] Even so, thataspiration fell to the vision of one grand nation of thirteen states—a vision ofthe framers that enabled slave states to reject abolition.Shays’ Rebellion: Political Inequality Becomes a Core Constitutional ValueRecall from the Introduction that Shays’ Rebellion caused colonial elites towrestle with the implications of a broadly enjoyed voter franchise. Therebellion itself was short-lived. An armed protest in western Massachusetts byindebted small farmers run afoul of creditors after borrowing to pay taxes wasquickly suppressed by the militia. It produced few casualties (eight deathsincluding two looters) and a few debtors were freed from prison. But Shays’Rebellion was a supremely pivotal moment in American history, because shortlyafter their protest was put down, the farmers found success through the ballotbox. As 1787 arrived, they refused reelection of the Massachusetts governor,inducing state lawmakers to soon enact much of their agenda—debt forgiveness,progressive taxes, and easy money (printing) laws.The lawmakers’ response demonstrated that voters could exercise theirsovereignty to trump the influence of elites. Colonial creditors, attorneys,merchants, slave owners, and wealthy landowners were stunned by the spectacle ofMassachusetts lawmakers acting like, well, politicians. Historian John Ferlingexplained the elites’ angst: “This was not the American Revolution that they hadimagined . . . they sought the means of removing important decisions frompopular control . . . the most conservative Americans . . . grew steadily moreagitated about what a Massachusetts merchant called ‘plebian despotism and the“fangs” of the citizenry.’ ”6 [Notes.html#C6F06]Anxious elites mobilized swiftly in the heat of the moment to secretly debateways and means of ending political equality and voter sovereignty. Theirsolution was a Constitutional Convention of selected attendance that convenedwithin weeks in Philadelphia. Their goal was to unwind the quality of democracyempowered by the Second Continental Congress in 1776 and its outgrowth, theArticles of Confederation. Historian Joseph J. Ellis cites James Madison’s“critical assessment of the popularly elected state governments” as a reflectionof his and many of his fellow Philadelphia delegates’ fear of political equalityand voter sovereignty.7 [Notes.html#C6F07]Certainly, there were other nagging issues of moment requiring revisions to theArticles. A federal structure was needed for the new nation, including a systemfor selecting a president and creating federal taxing authorities to sustainlaw, order, national defense, and credit reform. But an important—perhaps themost important—motivation for the framers’ abrupt rewrite of the nation’sfounding document in Philadelphia that summer was the danger they perceived fromthe emerging high-quality colonial democracy. Their intention to roll back theArticles was made clear by the fact that only six of the nation’s fifty-sixfounding fathers were invited to or attended the Constitutional Convention.The Constitutional Architecture: A Faux DemocracyThe framers’ overreaction in the wake of Shays’ Rebellion produced a governancearchitecture that has denied political equality to Americans in the centuriessince. Historian Matthew Simpson summarizes: “The proposed government was lessdemocratic than either the Articles of Confederation or the individual stateconstitutions. For example, the president would be chosen by an ElectoralCollege rather than by citizens themselves; senators would be appointed by statelegislators; the smallest states would have as many senators as the largest . .. The constitution was designed to reverse the democratic trajectory of Americanpolitics.”8 [Notes.html#C6F08]The rejection of political equality and sovereignty is exemplified by theElectoral College and, of course, the issue of slavery. Nearly half(twenty-five) of the delegates were slaveholders; several of them owned morethan 200 slaves. The new constitution established the primacy of federalauthority in many matters. Congress, not the states, henceforth was thedeterminant legal authority on a number of issues, including slavery. Thus,slave owners demanded that the newly empowered Congress be prevented from everabolishing slavery. If their demand went unaddressed, the delegates from slavestates appeared determined to create their own separate nation, perhaps inleague with France or Spain. There is a misimpression among historians that theslavery issue pitted large states against small. Not true. James Madisonprovides clarity on this point: “The states were divided into differentinterests not by their difference in size, but principally from their having ornot having slaves . . . It did not lie between the large and small states, itlay between the Northern and Southern.”9 [Notes.html#C6F09]To preserve the union, the framers accepted a constitutionally guaranteed rightfor Americans to hold human beings in bondage in perpetuity. That right wasguaranteed by creation of a second legislative body (the Senate) that gave voteparity to each state—a malapportioned, undemocratic provision that granted slavestates a veto in perpetuity over all laws.The framers also created a constitution centered on selective individualliberty, with white and a handful of Black male voters (and a few women) ofmeans comprising the electorate. The expectation in this new construct was thatlawmakers would routinely substitute their own judgment for the will of elitevoters, voter sovereignty rejected. Ferling notes Hamilton’s support for thiselite bias: “Hamilton emphasized the preservation of order and stability, theprotection of those who had reached society’s summit, and the means ofrestraining those who had not . . . He was convinced that social stabilityrequired the presence of a strong central government dominated by those at thetop of a hierarchical society.”10 [Notes.html#C6F10]This history explains why, despite its provenance in the Declaration ofIndependence, America has had an erratic and ultimately unsuccessful courtshipwith the concept of political equality. At Gettysburg, Lincoln termed politicalequality the nation’s “sheet anchor.”11 [Notes.html#C6F11] It is true that mostwomen, Native Americans, and Americans of color have come to enjoy thefranchise. Yet, the income bias and the resurgence of state-sponsoreddisenfranchisement by the GOP of late are evidence that voter sovereignty andpolitical equality remain only aspirational in America. Indeed, without seminalreforms to pay-to-play and to the US Senate, the nation’s electoral system, andthe Electoral College, noted in later chapters, they are unobtainable.The political revolutions of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Europe producedfour seminal pillars of democratic governance: acknowledgment of the supremacyof individual human rights (including the abolition of slavery), governmentbased on the political equality of each citizen, representatives who fairly hearand fairly heed voters, and the shackling of economic elites and monarchs whodominated previous societies. Aside from rejecting the British monarchy, theAmerican Constitution lacks all four pillars.In stark contrast, voter equality and sovereignty has become the global goldstandard for a genuinely democratic society by other wealthy democracies overthe past century. Operationally, that gold standard means the absence ofdependence corruption, as noted by Harvard law professor LawrenceLessig—lawmakers craft outcomes for the broad public good rather than on behalfof donors. Robert C. Post, dean of the Yale Law School, calls this desideratum astate of “electoral integrity,” where elections are sufficiently fair and freeof taint that they accurately reflect public sentiment—where each vote is fairlyheard and is weighted equally with its neighbor by representatives.Political inequality is deeply embedded in America’s constitutional DNA. Butrealizing the goal of political equality in America means acknowledging thedistinction between the Constitution and original intent. The latter is aseparate, prior, and more foundational standard. And laws or Supreme Courtrulings such as the Buckley genre that affirm, promote, or shield politicalinequality do not necessarily comport with original intent. In any case, as wasargued earlier, there is no ambiguity regarding the founding fathers andframers’ position on political bribery writ large; they greatly feared thepathologies incited by vote buying. And modern research on those pathologies hasfully credentialed their fears, as we will next see."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 7 [Contents.html#CH07][images/common.jpg]Political Bribery Decriminalized: Vote Buying as “Free Speech”[Contents.html#CH07a]There is only scant evidence that independent expenditures ever ingratiate.1[Notes.html#C7F01]—Justice Anthony Kennedy, Majority opinion in Citizens United, 2010In the last nine years, six [Buckley genre] Supreme Court decisions have wreakedhavoc on the nation’s campaign finance laws, opening the door to super PACs andcorporate spending, creating new channels for wealthy donors and candidates toinfluence elections, and weakening programs meant to lower barriers for ordinaryAmericans to run for office.2 [Notes.html#C7F02]—Brennan Center for Justice, New York University Law School, 2016FRANK CAPRA’S GREATEST FILM was Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. Andy Barr is noMr. Smith.As a newly elected member of Congress in 2012, Andy Barr really hit the groundrunning. Before he had even been sworn in, Andy, a former lobbyist fromKentucky, had a decidedly odd fundraiser for a freshman Congressman. It wascosponsored by a powerful K Street lobbyist whose clients included financialfirms like Bank of America and MasterCard International. It was held at theupscale Charlie Palmer Steak house, within sight of the Capitol, a decidedlyglitzy setting for soliciting campaign contributions for a new Congressman. Thecrowd was heavy on financial industry lobbyists including powerful donors likethe American Bankers Association and PNC Bank.3 [Notes.html#C7F03]How did the neophyte Andy earn such a celebrated welcome to Washington? It turnsout that Andy is a very lucky young man. The forty-year-old freshman Republicanhad won a coveted appointment to the House Financial Services committee. Therewas intense bank industry pressure to jump Barr over more than a hundred moresenior GOP members of Congress covetous of that slot, and the GOP leadershipwilted. The industry had obviously concluded Barr was theirs. And Andy? Well, hemay not appreciate the complexities of banking, but he certainly knows thesecret of success in Washington. The Financial Services Committee controlsbanking regulations, making it the primo spot on Capitol Hill for attractingcampaign cash from the richest of all US industries. Andy may be clueless aboutCDOs (collateralized debt obligations), but not about the key to a long careerin the Buckley era of American politics.You might think of folks like Andy as public servants. But the donor classthinks of politicians like him as an investment, and Andy was an asset who waspositioned to yield a bonanza return of fruitful votes for years to come. Onedonor explained Barr this way for New York Times journalist Eric Lipton: “It’salmost like investing in a first-round draft pick for the NBA or NFL. There is apotential there. So we make an investment, and we are hopeful that investmentproduces a return.”4 [Notes.html#C7F04]Andy soon made his investors look clever, providing a quick return on theirinitial outlay of $151,200 in campaign donations. Although he campaigned as afiscal prude, Congressman Barr committed to donors by his first April in officeto sponsor a financial industry tax loophole law that would deepen the deficitby $500 million annually. Even better, the promising rookie introducedlegislation to unwind a portion of the Dodd-Frank reregulation law thatprohibits financial institutions from lending to unqualified home buyers. Theambitious young man either didn’t know or didn’t care that such predatorysubprime loans were a major cause of the Great Recession a few years earlier.Congressman Barr is far from being alone in trading away the public interest andcommon sense in exchange for cash. Another promising investment by bankingindustry lobbyists is Congresswoman Ann Wagner of Missouri. In appreciation fortheir contributions, she sponsored legislation to derail the Obamaadministration “fiduciary rule” protecting consumers; it required life insuranceand financial brokers selling financial products to put their clients’ interestahead of their own. Such protections are commonplace in every other wealthydemocracy. The (Obama) White House Council of Economic Advisers found thatAmericans pay $17 billion annually in excess broker commission because brokersput their own financial interests first. Even so, the Trump administrationprotected the scam by financial advisors, torpedoing the reform proposed by theObama administration just as Wagner and the financial industry wanted.5[Notes.html#C7F05]Barr and Wagner are part of a wave of politicians with, well, Randian viewstoward public service who have entered politics over the last two decades. Theyare willing to spend four hours daily in a cubical for half the week phoningstrangers for money. Their most receptive targets are upper income Americansacross the nation and corporate officers hoping to influence lawmakers toenhance profits by lowering taxes, suppressing wages, and the like. And theirsoulmates are Roberts Republicans.Decriminalizing Vote BuyingThe Roberts Republicans contend the vast bulk of political contributions andthird-party independent expenditures on behalf of lawmakers are “not corruption. . . [but ] embody a central feature of democracy.”6 [Notes.html#C7F06] Intheir view, a donation reciprocated by an explicit quid pro quo (say, agovernment contract) constitutes corruption. But, donations to acquire as yetunspecified future benefits from the same lawmaker—such as a supportive vote onfavored legislation—are instead “a central feature of democracy.” Fordham Lawprofessor Zephyr Teachout argues that this definitional legerdemain is“bedeviled by problems and confusion. Subsequent [judicial] decisions areunclear about the meaning of ‘explicit’ and how the quid pro quo requirement isdefined . . . Nearly twenty-five years later it is still not clear exactly whatkind of campaign exchange constitutes a violation . . .”7 [Notes.html#C7F07]The decriminalization of cash given to or spent on behalf of politicians ignoresthe intent of donors to buy votes; donors always and everywhere intend toinfluence the recipient’s viewpoint. That is why Judge Posner describes the“legislative system [as] one of quasi-bribery.”8 [Notes.html#C7F08] The lateDemocratic Senator Russell B. Long was more, well, measured in his assessment:“Almost a hairline’s difference separates bribes and contributions.”9[Notes.html#C7F09] Justice Kennedy dismissed those sentiments, asserting in themajority opinion of Citizens United that “There is only scant evidence thatindependent expenditures ever ingratiate.”10 [Notes.html#C7F10]There was one Republican Supreme Court justice during the Buckley era whodisputed Kennedy and the Roberts Republicans. In her opinion in McConnell v. FEC(2003), then-Justice Sandra Day O’Connor wrote:We [have] recognized a concern not confined to bribery of public officials, butextending to the broader threat from politicians too compliant with the wishesof large contributors . . . [M]any of the deeply disturbing examples ofcorruption cited by this Court . . . were not episodes of [quid pro quo] votebuying, but evidence that various corporate interests had given substantialdonations to gain access to high-level government officials . . .Justice Kennedy’s interpretation of the First Amendment would render Congresspowerless to address [these] more subtle but equally dispiriting forms ofcorruption. Just as troubling to a functioning democracy as classic quid pro quocorruption is the danger that officeholders will decide issues not on the meritsor the desires of their constituencies, but according to the wishes of those whohave made large financial contributions valued by the officeholder. Even if itoccurs only occasionally, the potential for such undue influence is manifest.11[Notes.html#C7F11]“There Is Only Scant Evidence That Independent Expenditures Ever Ingratiate”This Kennedy quote, a pillar of the Buckley genre, collapses under closescrutiny. Both independent expenditures and campaign contributions haverepeatedly been demonstrated to induce favorable voting by legislators—theprocess responsible for the income bias. University of Chicago law professorNicholas A. Stephanopoulos notes: “There is near consensus in the empiricalliterature that politicians’ positions more accurately reflect the view of theirdonors than those of their constituents.”12 [Notes.html#C7F12] Moreover,business donors occasionally misspeak by publicly revealing that contributionsare intended to buy votes. The National Association of Homebuilders PoliticalAction Committee (BUILD-PAC), for instance, ceased donating to Congress for aperiod in 2008, in a pique at congressional failure to reciprocate its donationsby increasing housing subsidies. Its criticism inadvertently leaked to thepress, causing campaign finance expert Kenneth Gross to note: “This highlyvisible carrot-and-stick approach to the use of PAC contributions displays adisquieting nexus between lobbying and political contributions.”13[Notes.html#C7F13] A second exposé occurred three years later in New York State.A trade association solicited $10,000 from each of its members; the pleaexplained, “Our future ability to adopt favorable legislation, stop terriblelegislation or modify legislation to limit the pain to our industry is directlytied to our continued positive relationship with all the leaders in Albany.”14[Notes.html#C7F14]Anecdotal evidence is buttressed by donors such as then-candidate Trump, whodescribed the political contributions he made in the course of his career asinvestments: “When I need something from them two years later, three yearslater, I call them.”15 [Notes.html#C7F15] This process of investing inpoliticians, as practiced by Trump and by bankers donating to Barr or Wagner,was generalized by professors Jennifer Brown, Katharine Drake, and Laura Wellmanin the American Accounting Association journal this way in 2015: “Proactivefirms build relationships with policymakers through continued campaign support,with the expectation of gaining some economic benefit.”16 [Notes.html#C7F16]Indeed, if contributions or independent expenditures on behalf of politiciansdid not influence them, they would not occur. It would simply be foolish forcorporations or billionaires to donate to politicians, much less to bothcandidates (as some do). In particular, worldly and canny billionaire campaigncontributors such as Sheldon Adelson and the Koch brothers would be fools.Whatever you may think of CEOs or the fittest fifty, they are not fools. Theyview spending on politicians such as Barr like any other investment; a return isexpected, as explained by lobbyist Theresa Kostrzewa in September 2015: “Donorsare demanding a lot these days, man, and they want answers and they want results. . . Donors consider a contribution like, ‘Well, wait, I just invested in you.Now I need to have my say; you need to answer to me.”17 [Notes.html#C7F17]The Roberts Republicans’ Pollyannaish perspective on political spending isbelied by the income bias, by the opinion of retired Justice O’Connor, and bythe billions of dollars invested in public officials by S&P 500 firm CEOs, theWaltons, the Kochs, and others of the fittest fifty.Further, there is a forty-year skein of scholarly studies providing evidencethat donations and third-party independent expenditures sway legislators. Theeffectiveness of such vote buying has been documented for a wide variety ofeconomic public policy issues, including derailing minimum wage increases(researchers Jonathan Silverman and Garey Durden, 1976), trucking deregulation(John Frendreis and Richard Waterman, 1985),18 [Notes.html#C7F18] and telecomindustry deregulation (Rui de Figueiredo and Geoff Edwards, 2005).19[Notes.html#C7F19] The digitization of statistical databases has addedconsiderable heft and breadth to this body of work in recent years, withanalyses definitively documenting causal linkages between political spending andchanges in voting behavior by lawmakers and judges. Examples include: • A 2015 analysis in the Journal of the American Accounting Associationby Jennifer Brown, Katharine Drake, and Laura Wellman concluded that targetedcorporate donations to Congressional lawmakers sitting on tax law committees(Senate Finance and House Ways and Means Committee members) during the 2000slowered firm-specific future expected tax rates an average 1.66 percent—for anaverage enterprise tax savings of $33 million.20 [Notes.html#C7F20] That is anastronomical investment return for a slew of 4-digit personal and PAC donations. • Finance professors Ran Duchin and Denis Sosyura parsed the linkbetween corporate donations prior to 2008 and the allocation of the $205 billionin Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) bank bailout subsidies that year: “Wefind that banks’ political ties played a significant role in TARP funddistribution . . . The TARP investment amounts are positively related to banks’political contributions and lobbying expenditures . . . The estimated magnitudesof political influence are substantial . . . [A] bank’s connection to a Housemember on key finance committees is associated with an 18.2 percent increase [inTARP funds], controlling for other factors.”21 [Notes.html#C7F21] • Journalist Steven Brill, founder of American Lawyer magazine,examined the consequence of $15 million in donations from hedge funds and othermoney managers intended to dilute the Obama administration’s Dodd-Frankreregulation legislation. His July 2010 analysis found that the largesse inducedmembers of Congress to insert a number of loopholes in Dodd-Frank, saving theindustry an estimated $10 billion in taxes annually. That translates to anastronomical return he calculated of 660 percent.22 [Notes.html#C7F22] • US multinationals in the mid-2000s were refusing to repatriatebillions of dollars in profits held in foreign banks in order to avoid payingthe US 35 percent corporate income tax rate. Corporate contributions inducedCongress and the George W. Bush administration to open a temporary tax loopholein 2005, momentarily cutting rates for such repatriations to 5.25 percent.23[Notes.html#C7F23] Corporations took quick advantage of the loophole torepatriate $312 billion in profits, saving over $90 billion in taxes. Economistsat the University of Kansas concluded the loophole returned $220 for everylobbying dollar spent.24 [Notes.html#C7F24] A replay of this lush scenario is alikely element in Trump administration tax changes.Vote buying is also bipartisan. In a study for the National Bureau of EconomicResearch in April 2017, Jeffrey Brown and Jiekun Huang found that meetings bysenior corporate officials with key White House Obama administrationpolicymakers from 2009 through 2015 were associated with more governmentcontracts, regulatory relief, and “abnormal stock returns.” They also found,following the 2016 election of Donald Trump, “that firms with access to theObama administration experience significantly lower stock returns” thanotherwise similar firms.25 [Notes.html#C7F25]Stratmann: Donations Buy Congressional Votes on Agriculture Commodity SubsidiesEconomist Thomas Stratmann conducted an expansive statistical analysis in 1990that documented the purchase of votes in the House of Representatives regardingagricultural commodity price supports (subsidies). This is an unusually powerfuldata set because there are affluent donors on both sides of such votes, such assugar growers opposed by confectionary and other industries favoring lowersweetener prices. Moreover, examining the impact of donations utilizingcommodity subsidy votes is a particularly revealing analysis because most Housemembers have few if any constituents directly connected with commodity pricesupports. They are essentially nonpartisan free votes for most lawmakers, makingthe influence of donors relatively transparent.Stratmann began with a database of individual members’ historic Congressionalvoting behaviors. He then evaluated their reaction to donations by PACsrepresenting growers. Compared to historic vote patterns, such donationsswitched an average 23.8 votes to yes (aye) on each of the ten agriculture pricesupport subsidy bills he examined. On three of the bills, political donationsswayed sufficient votes to determine the final outcome (chart 7.1). Forinstance, a vote to continue dairy subsidies (favored by farmers) passed theHouse by a count of 245–167 in 1990. Had the dairy industry not made campaigncontributions in the several years prior to the vote—or had their contributionsbeen neutralized by contributions from opponents—past individual votinghistories predicted that the outcome would have been a vote of 204–208, killingdairy price supports. Similarly, Stratmann found that a vote to continue sugarsubsidies, enacted by a margin of 267–146, would have failed by a projected voteof 194–219 in the absence of political spending by sugar beet and cane growers;donations switched the votes of seventy-three members of Congress on that one.Stratmann also discovered that lawmaker votes are sold pretty darn cheaply: “A$3,000 sugar PAC contribution maps into a yes vote with almost certainty.”26[Notes.html#C7F26][images/pg106.jpg]Chart 7.1 Farm commodity subsidies are determined by contributors.Thomas Stratmann, “What Do Campaign Contributions Buy? Deciphering CausalEffects of Money and Votes,” Southern Economic Journal 57:3 (January 1991),table IV, http://www.jstor.org/stable/1059776[http://www.jstor.org/stable/1059776]Buying Courtroom VerdictsThe vast majority of judicial verdicts in America are rendered in state andlocal courts, and nearly 90 percent of the judges in those courts are elected.This pervasive reliance on elections to select state and local jurists stands insharp contrast with the practice of other wealthy democracies where judges areappointed on merit and are nonpartisan. Indeed, judges abroad are on a much moredemanding, professionalized career track. Retired Supreme Court Justice O’Connorexplains why other nations reject American-style judicial elections: “No othernation in the world does that because they realize they’re not going to get fairand impartial judges that way.”27 [Notes.html#C7F27]Traditionally, US judicial elections have been modest affairs. But like stateand local legislative elections, that has changed in recent years. Supreme Courtjustices in Florida, for instance, raised a total of just $7,500 between 2000and 2010 for their elections and most races were uncontested. In 2014 alone,however, the three judges seeking reelection raised $1.5 million in donations.28[Notes.html#C7F28] More than $2.6 million was spent on electioneering to fill anopen Supreme Court seat in Wisconsin in April 2016.29 [Notes.html#C7F29] Andjudges in Ohio now routinely raise millions of dollars for their election.30[Notes.html#C7F30]Contributions and independent expenditures by favor seekers involving judicialraces have soared for two reasons. First, Republican politicians since 2010 insome states have run afoul of state courts that have opposed GOP budget cuts,especially for public education. In Kansas, for instance, tax-cuttingRepublicans in control of the state government reduced inflation-adjustedper-student spending statewide by 16.5 percent between 2008 and 2014.31[Notes.html#C7F31] Concerned parents sued, and the state Supreme Court judgedthat the size and distribution of the cuts (with wealthy suburbs protected)violated the state constitution. The governor and legislators refused courtorders to ameliorate the cuts. Frustrated with their recalcitrance, the stateSupreme Court threatened to close all public schools until lawmakers enactedremedies. That put GOP Governor Sam Brownback and the legislature in the awkwardposition of having to raise taxes and education spending, offending the Kochs,their neighboring donors headquartered in Wichita. They chose instead to mimicthe Turkish autocrat Recep Erdoğan and the extreme right Polish Law and Justicepolitical party by seeking removal of the disfavored judges. Kansas GOPlawmakers opposed the reelection of Supreme Court justices in 2016 and alsovoted to strip the court of power to rule on the constitutionality of educationspending.32 [Notes.html#C7F32] Kansans are pretty conservative, but even theywere disappointed with the GOP lawmakers, voting fourteen of them out of officein the August 2016 primaries; previously, only three GOP incumbents had beenousted in sixteen years. In November 2016, voters reelected all the proeducationstate Supreme Court justices, and replaced thirteen Republican state lawmakerswith Democrats.33 [Notes.html#C7F33] Chastened lawmakers joined with Democratsto reverse most of the income tax cuts at the root of the problem in June 2017.Even so, Kansas income taxes retained their Republican flavor: the poorest willbe paying more than twice the share of their income in taxes (11.8 percent) asthe richest 1 percent of Kansans pay 4.8 percent.Second, interest groups, including corporations, have come to appreciate thewindfalls on offer from buying favorable court rulings. Judicial vote buying haspaid off spectacularly in some instances. West Virginia Supreme Court JusticeBrent Benjamin cast the deciding vote absolving the Massey Coal Company ofnegligence for miner deaths after receiving its $3 million campaign donation.That instance of vote buying was subsequently held to be constitutional by theRoberts Republicans.34 [Notes.html#C7F34] Voters took a dimmer view of thecorruption than the Roberts Republicans, however, defeating Benjamin’s bid forreelection in 2016. Another example is Illinois Supreme Court Judge LloydKarmeier. He cast the deciding vote to overturn a $1.18 billion appellate courtverdict (Avery v. State Farm) against the State Farm insurance firm afterreceiving that firm’s $1.35 million donation.35 [Notes.html#C7F35]Such incidents have become sufficiently commonplace for the American BarAssociation to contend that there is “a pervasive public perception thatcampaign contributions influence judicial decision-making.”36 [Notes.html#C7F36]And surveys support that contention. Polling by the Brennan Center for Justicein October 2013, for instance, found that 87 percent of Americans believecontributions and independent political/issue advertising involving judicialcandidates has some or a great deal of influence on court rulings.37[Notes.html#C7F37] Indeed, surveyed separately and anonymously, nearly one-halfof the polled judges themselves agreed that rulings are sold at auction.These contentions and perceptions are supported by facts. A variety of scholarlyanalyses have documented extensive vote buying by litigants before state courts,including: • In 2013, law professor Joanna Shepherd examined 175,000 donations tostate supreme court judges nationwide and found that elected judges chronicallyfavor donors. As the share of contributions to judges from business interestsrose from 1 percent to 50 percent of all donations received, for instance, thelikelihood of the typical judge rendering probusiness rulings rose by 42percentage points. Any firm—and especially those whose business model skirtsregulations or the law—would be foolish indeed not to invest in a clutch ofjudges.38 [Notes.html#C7F38] It is also revealing that judges on the verge ofretirement abandon their donors. In a separate study, Shepherd and coauthorMichael Kang discovered: “In the last term before mandatory retirement, thefavoritism toward business litigants by judges facing partisan and non-partisanelections essentially disappears.”39 [Notes.html#C7F39] • The Center for American Progress examined the impact of pay-to-playon judicial rulings in states electing judges in the wake of Citizens United. Itconcluded, “In the span of a few short years, big business succeeded intransforming courts such as the Texas and Ohio Supreme Courts into forums whereindividuals face steep hurdles to holding corporations accountable.”40[Notes.html#C7F40] • In an analysis of the Ohio Supreme Court published in 2006 coveringabout 1,500 contested cases, a New York Times investigation documented thatdonors bought judicial rulings: “Its justices routinely sat on cases afterreceiving campaign contributions from the parties involved or from groups thatfiled supporting briefs. On average, they voted in favor of contributors 70percent of the time.” One justice voted in favor 91 percent of the time.41[Notes.html#C7F41] “The justices almost never disqualified themselves fromhearing their contributors’ cases.”42 [Notes.html#C7F42]Palmer and Levendis: Donations Buy Judicial RulingsOver a fourteen-year period (1992–2006), Tulane law professor Vernon ValentinePalmer and Loyola University professor John Levendis reviewed donor records andensuing judicial decisions involving the seven Louisiana State Supreme Courtjustices. The scholars began with a statistical baseline revealing the justices’history of favoring plaintiffs or defendants in cases not involvingcontributors. About one-half of all cases did not involve contributors, and thejustices tended to favor defendants in slightly more than one-half (53 percent)of those rulings, as reproduced in chart 7.2.The remainder were cases where at least one litigant (or their litigator) was adonor but justices did not recuse (they almost never recused). The presence ofdonors as party to suits significantly changed voting behavior. When apreponderance of contributions had been received from the defendants’ side,judges favored defendants in 67 percent of their rulings. But, when plaintiffswere the dominant donors, the judges supported defendants only 39 percent of thetime. Overall, Palmer and Levendis determined that buying judicial rulings was asound investment. Political spending increased the bribers’ odds of favorablecourt rulings by 26 percent: “The data indicate that judicial voting favorsplaintiffs’ or defendants’ positions not on the basis of judicial leaning orphilosophical orientation but on the basis of the size and timing of a politicaldonation.”43 [Notes.html#C7F43][images/pg110.jpg]Chart 7.2 1992–2006 Donors buy court justice.Vernon Valentine Palmer and John Levendis, “The Louisiana Supreme Court inQuestion: An Empirical and Statistical Study of the Effects of Campaign Money onthe Judicial Function,” Tulane Law Review 82 (2008),www.law.tulane.edu/uploadedFiles/Tulane_Journal_Sites/Tulane_Law_Review/docs/824palmer27.pdf[http://www.law.tulane.edu/uploadedFiles/Tulane_Journal_Sites/Tulane_Law_Review/docs/824palmer27.pdf]Palast: Judges Acknowledge a Pay-to-Play Judicial SystemOn behalf of the reform group Justice at Stake, attorney Geri Palast compiledresults from a 2002 survey by the Greenberg, Quinlan, Rosner Research firm. Thesurvey included 2,428 judges serving on state supreme courts, appellate courts,and lower courts, nearly all subject to election. The survey was anonymous.The responses revealed that a huge share of judges anonymously believedpay-to-play has created a two-tier American judicial system at the state level:81 percent were concerned that America has one judicial system for the wealthyand powerful and another for everyone else.44 [Notes.html#C7F44] As reproducedin chart 7.3, 46 percent of the justices candidly acknowledged that judicialvotes are influenced by donors. Some 57 percent admitted to anxiety aboutobtaining sufficient donations in election years. And 84 percent acknowledgedthat special interest groups, corporations, and individuals use donations toinfluence judges and shape public policy. Some 56 percent of the judges agreedanonymously that “judges should be prohibited from presiding over and ruling incases where one of the sides has given money to their campaign.”45[Notes.html#C7F45]Recusal Is Not a RemedyThe pervasiveness of vote buying means that recusal is not a feasible remedy tojudicial bribery. Requiring recusal is popularly viewed as the solution tojudicial pay-to-play. A Marist poll, for example, found that 87 percent of NewYorkers favored judicial recusal in instances involving donors that werelitigants in a suit.46 [Notes.html#C7F46] And the survey noted earlier conductedfor the Brennan Center during October 2013 found an even larger 92 percent ofrespondents believed “when one party in a court case has either donated directlyto a judge’s campaign or spent significantly on election materials designed tohelp elect the judge, the judge should step aside:”47 [Notes.html#C7F47]Finally, in the analysis of the Ohio Supreme Court noted earlier covering about1,500 contested cases, the authors concluded: “In the 12 years that werestudied, the justices almost never disqualified themselves from hearing theircontributors’ cases. In the 215 cases with the most direct potential conflictsof interest, for example, justices recused themselves just 9 times.”48[Notes.html#C7F48][images/pg112.jpg]Chart 7.3 “When guaranteed anonymity, judges assert that . . .”Geri Palast, “Justice at Stake,” American Viewpoint, January 2002,www.justiceatstake.org/media/cms/JASJudgesSurveyResults_EA8838C0504A5.pdf[http://www.justiceatstake.org/media/cms/JASJudgesSurveyResults_EA8838C0504A5.pdf]Unfortunately, the prevalence of lax ethical standards has caused vote buying tobecome so embedded in state-level jurisprudence that recusal is now impractical.The Ohio Supreme Court justices participating in the 2006 study explained thatrequiring recusal in suits involving donor-litigants would be “a recipe forhavoc,” leaving far too few judges left to man courtrooms. The only feasibleremedy is to bring a halt to the election of judges.As we see next, the broad pattern of widespread vote buying that involveslawmakers and judges has sown deep cynicism about American democracy."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 8 [Contents.html#CH08][images/common.jpg]The Buckley Era: Cynicism and Diminished Faith in Democracy[Contents.html#CH08a]The appearance of influence or access . . . will not cause the electorate tolose faith in our democracy.1 [Notes.html#C8F01]—Justice Anthony Kennedy, Citizens United majority opinion, 2010Sixty-three percent of voters also still think most members of Congress arewilling to sell their vote for either cash or a campaign contribution.2[Notes.html#C8F02]—Rasmussen survey, August 2014It [harsh antigovernment rhetoric] did produce a deep cynicism that is anexistential threat to democracy.3 [Notes.html#C8F03]—Eric O’Keefe, multimillionaire Republican party donor, March 2012AMERICANS HAVE LOST FAITH in their democracy. In 1964, 77 percent of respondentsto a Pew Research Center survey trusted the government in Washington “to do whatis right just about always or most of the time.” By 2015, only 19 percentbelieved that, a record low. The only less-trusted entities are big business (18percent) and Congress (9 percent). It is the pay-to-play culture that mostrespondents view as responsible for the cynicism responsible for this plunge inconfidence in American governance.4 [Notes.html#C8F04] Indeed, 74 percent of Pewrespondents agreed that “most elected officials put their own interests ahead ofthe country’s interest.”5 [Notes.html#C8F05] Americans’ high degree of distrustin politics reveals as sophistry the Citizens United majority opinion written byJustice Kennedy: “We now conclude that independent expenditures, including thosemade by corporations, do not give rise to corruption or the appearance ofcorruption . . . The appearance of influence or access . . . will not cause theelectorate to lose faith in our democracy.”6 [Notes.html#C8F06]The cynicism revealed by this Pew data suggests many Americans would viewKennedy as a fool. That attitude is both widespread and is a bipartisanphenomenon. Reproduced in chart 8.1, for instance, a New York Times/CBS Newssurvey released in June 2015 found that supermajorities of Democrats,Republicans, and Independents alike believe that “money has too much influence”in politics. Moreover, a solid majority of the respondents were pessimistic thatlawmakers would ever reform pay-to-play.7 [Notes.html#C8F07][images/pg114.jpg]Chart 8.1 Share of respondents agreeing that . . .Nicholas Confessore and Megan Thee-Brenan, “Poll Shows Americans Favor anOverhaul of Campaign Financing,” New York Times, June 3, 2015; and “Americans’Views on Money in Politics,” New York Times/CBS News poll, June 2, 2015.Deep cynicism is even evident among American youth. Surveys by ProfessorJennifer Lawless of American University and law professor Richard Fox of LoyolaUniversity found that pay-to-play politics “has turned off an entiregeneration.” They polled 4,200 high school and college students during the 2012election cycle. Some 85 percent did not think elected officials want to helppeople, with 60 percent convinced they are actually dishonest. In consideringcareers, “they’d rather do almost anything else” than run for political office.8[Notes.html#C8F08] As the former British Labor Party leader Ed Miliband noted,corrupted politics diminishes the spirit of community so vital to a generous,caring society because it “sends the message that anything goes, that right andwrong don’t matter, that we can all be in it for ourselves as long as we can getaway with it. What is a young person just starting out in life, trying to do theright thing, supposed to think when he sees a politician fiddling the expensessystem, a banker raking off millions without deserving it, or a press baronabusing the trust of ordinary people?”9 [Notes.html#C8F09]Even the business community is dismayed by American democracy. A survey ofhundreds of corporate leaders jointly by the business-supported Conference Boardand the Committee for Economic Development in mid-2013 found extremely highlevels of cynicism about American governance. Indeed, only 5 percent ofrespondents disagreed with the term “pay-to-play” to describe American democracyin the Buckley era. Virtually all (94 percent) agreed that pay-to-play causes“politicians to cast votes to please special interests rather than voters.” Some71 percent agreed that major donors have “too much influence on politicians,” 79percent agreed that the Buckley genre drives “politicians and political partiesto be more extreme,” and 83 percent believed pay-to-play is “contributing toCongressional inability to solve big problems the country is facing.” Some 74percent agreed that it is “harming our democracy.”10 [Notes.html#C8F10]The growth of corporate political donations following the Citizens United rulingin 2010 exacerbated this cynicism. Surveys by the Rasmussen polling firm foundthat the share of Americans believing their elected representatives sell accessand policy outcomes to donors rose from an already elevated 59 percent in 2006to 79 percent in 2013.11 [Notes.html#C8F11] One of the most detailed assessmentsof public attitudes toward corporate donations in the wake of that ruling is theOctober 2012 survey by the Corporate Reform Coalition (CRC) noted in chapter 5[Chapter05.html]. The survey found supermajorities of respondents believing thatcorporate donations and independent political expenditures make politics morenegative and exacerbate corruption in state and federal government.12[Notes.html#C8F12] Reproduced in chart 8.2, 75 percent or more of CRCrespondents believed donations induce Congress to reject laws protectingconsumers, that corporate donations make politics more negative, and that theyworsen Congressional corruption. Some 84 percent of respondents believed thatcorporate donations drown out the voices of ordinary voters. As with othersurveys, this cynicism is bipartisan. At least 72 percent of every majorpolitical cohort—conservatives, liberals, independents, Democrats, andRepublicans—believed that corporate political spending in any form iscorrupting.[images/pg116.jpg]Chart 8.2 The business community recognizes the dangers posed by Citizen United.Liz Kennedy, “Citizens Actually United: The Bi-partisan Opposition to CorporatePolitical Spending and Support for Common Sense Reform,” Demos, October 25,2012,www.demos.org/publication/citizens-actually-united-bi-partisan-opposition-corporate-political-spending-and-support[http://www.demos.org/publication/citizens-actually-united-bi-partisan-opposition-corporate-political-spending-and-support]Perceived Congressional Corruption Creates CynicismSurveys and scholarly research have found that dismay with vote buying iscentered on its impact on Congress. An expansive survey by political scientistsat the University of Texas, for example, found that 82 percent of respondentsagreed corruption in Congress was “very serious or somewhat serious” (chart8.3). Two-thirds believed that members of Congress are dishonest. And two-thirdsalso believed that donations and independent political spending do ingratiate,belying Justice Kennedy’s opinion.Similar levels of cynicism are revealed by a number of Rasmussen surveys,including one conducted by telephone in February 2016, reproduced in chart 8.4(next page). Supermajorities of respondents believe that wealthy individuals andAmerican corporations “have too much influence over elections.” And the level ofcynicism is such that majorities are convinced their own representatives inCongress routinely sell votes for cash or campaign contributions regardless ofconstituent preferences.[images/pg117.jpg]Chart 8.3 MC is Member of Congress (2009).Money in Politics National Survey, November 3, 2009, reported by Ross Ramsey,“Americans Worry About Sources of Political Cash,” The Texas Tribune, November16, 2009,www.texastribune.org/2009/11/16/americans-worry-about-sources-of-political-cash/[http://www.texastribune.org/2009/11/16/americans-worry-about-sources-of-political-cash/][images/pg118.jpg]Chart 8.4 Their own member of Congress sells votes.“Voters Say Money, Media Have Too Much Political Clout,” Rasmussen Reports,February16, 2016,www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/general_politics/february_2016/voters_say_money_media_have_too_much_political_clout[http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/general_politics/february_2016/voters_say_money_media_have_too_much_political_clout]International ComparisonsSupermajorities believe the American Congress and state courts are routinelysuborned by donors. Moreover, Americans’ perception of that corruption is themost severe self-assessment by citizens in any wealthy democracy—and on a parwith government corruption as perceived domestically in countries such asAzerbaijan, Belize, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Turkey, and Venezuela.Berlin-based Transparency International (TI) is a world leader in monitoring,documenting, and advocating against government corruption. A global resource, TIproduces an annual matrix of the perceived extent of public sector corruption ina number of nations, drawing on surveys of local citizens in each country. Itmeasures “the degree to which corruption is perceived to exist among a country’spublic officials and politicians.”In 2015, the cynicism of Americans caused the United States to be ranked onlysixteenth, worse than New Zealand, Singapore, Iceland, Canada, and a number ofnorthern European nations. Since pay-to-play ballooned in the 1990s, America hasnever ranked better than fourteenth (in 2000). Indeed, in recent years, thesedomestic assessments have variously rated the US government as more corrupt thangovernments in Barbados or Hong Kong, just as corrupt as Uruguay, and onlyslightly less corrupt than governments in the Bahamas, Chile, and Qatar.13[Notes.html#C8F13]The TI findings are affirmed by other global surveys, including the periodicGallup World Polls. Among peer nations—those with a free press (earning theauthoritative Freedom House Media Freedom status)—domestic surveys put theextent of corruption in American governance at a poor twenty-fifth in the Gallup2015 evaluation.14 [Notes.html#C8F14] The extent of what US respondents termed“widespread” corruption in American governance was more severe than the levelperceived by respondents about their own governments in Belize, Estonia, Latvia,Malta, or Slovakia, and was tied with Mauritius.TI also surveys domestic opinion in the hundred most developed nations regardingthe extent of corruption specifically in national legislatures. The US Congressreceives quite poor marks, reproduced in chart 8.5. The share of Americansasserting that Congress is either “corrupt or extremely corrupt” was twice thatof respondents in northern European nations and on a par with local assessmentsof parliaments in India, Pakistan, and Venezuela.The cynicism of Americans regarding their judiciary is just as severe as theirrather dismal assessment of Congress. Chart 8.6 (page 121[Chapter08.html#page_121]) is reproduced from the TI 2010/2011 Global CorruptionBarometer survey asking locals to judge the degree of corruption exhibited bytheir domestic judiciaries. The share of Americans believing the US judiciary iscorrupt or extremely corrupt—from the Supreme Court down to local courts—is 45percent; that is on a par with the level of cynicism expressed by respondents inAzerbaijan or Indonesia. This share of cynical Americans is by far the highestof any wealthy democracy and higher than local opinion even in authoritarianTurkey (41 percent) or India (41 percent) where judicial bribery is alsocommonplace.[images/pg120.jpg]Chart 8.5 Congress viewed as corrupt as the Indian Parliament.“Perception of Corruption,” Domestic Share of Respondents Viewing TheirNationalLegislature as “Corrupt” or “Extremely Corrupt,” table 1b, GlobalCorruption Barometer 2010/2011, Transparency International,https://www.transparency.org/gcb201011 [https://www.transparency.org/gcb201011]These sentiments are crystallized in the authoritative Freedom House assessmentof the quality of national representative governance across the globe. Primarilyfor its weak electoral system and pay-to-play, the United States was stripped ofits place in the first rank of democracies by Freedom House in 2016. The qualityof its governance placed a woeful thirty-second behind nations such as Kiribatiand Palau, its ranking on a par with Cape Verde and Costa Rica.15[Notes.html#C8F15]Cynicism Caused by Buckley Empowers American AuthoritarianismCynicism about the honesty of its lawmakers and jurists has caused Americans toquestion the values of democracy itself. A rather startling World Value Survey(WVS) reported by lead investigator Roberto Foa and Yascha Mounk of Harvardfound rising support between 1995 and 2011 among Americans for authoritariangovernment (chart 8.7). This increase certainly reflects a high level of dismayand frustration with pay-to-play in Congress and the courts. But it also likelyreflects dismay with the betrayal by political elites of economic expectationsof average Americans: profits rise briskly as wages stagnate, high value jobsare offshored, economic mobility dwindles, and income disparities worsen. Evenso, it is stunning that fewer than half (46.5 percent) of American respondentsin the WVS agreed it is “absolutely important” to even live in a democracy.16[Notes.html#C8F16] That is the lowest share among citizens of any wealthydemocracy. Even more dismaying, it is a lower share than in nearly any otherdemocracy, including quite imperfect ones such as Armenia, Cyprus, Qatar,Romania, South Africa, Tunisia, Uruguay, and Uzbekistan.17 [Notes.html#C8F17][images/pg121.jpg]Chart 8.6 American courts viewed as corrupt as those in India and Turkey.“Perception of Corruption,” table 1b, Global Corruption Barometer 2010/2011,Transparency International, https://www.transparency.org/gcb201011[https://www.transparency.org/gcb201011]At 32 percent, the share of Americans in July 2016 who supported a strong leaderdispensing with elections and Congress was not a fringe group. This support isconsiderably more pronounced among Republicans, who also came to increasinglyadmire Russian President Vladimir Putin during the course of the 2016 election.Only 12 percent of Republicans polled by Gallup viewed the murderous Putinfavorably in 2015. But Russian meddling in the 2016 election, candidate Trump’sembrace of that meddling, and his surprising win may well be responsible fornormalizing Putin with GOP supporters. Putin’s favorability rating tripled to 37percent among Republican respondents in a YouGov/Economist survey in December2016 (also chart 8.7).Recall that during the campaign, Donald Trump urged the Russian government torelease hacked information casting Hillary Clinton in an unfavorable light.Earlier, his oldest son, son-in-law, and campaign manager met with four Russianspromising confidential Kremlin information embarrassing to Clinton as “part ofRussia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump.”18 [Notes.html#C8F18] Thisinterference reflected the Kremlin’s tactic (in France, Germany, theNetherlands, and elsewhere as well as the United States) to aggressively bombardvoters with misinformation during elections.[images/pg122.jpg]Chart 8.7 Share of respondents (%) . . .Live in Democracy: World Value Survey, Wave 6 (question 140).

First, Putin sought to enhance electoral gainfor candidate Trump (as reviewed in chapter 14 [Chapter14.html]) by demonizingHillary Clinton.19 [Notes.html#C8F19] His second objective more broadly was todeploy fake news to spin corruption and conspiracy theories that besmirched thedemocratic process itself. Psychology professor Karen Douglas at the Universityof Kent in Britain explained Putin’s logic: “Therefore rather than empoweringpeople to stand up and act on perceived injustices, conspiracy theories appearto make them disengage and instead do nothing. They seem to erode trust inpoliticians and institutions and lead to apathy rather than action. Why wouldpeople want to vote for a political system that they think is constantlycommitting crimes and hiding information from the public?”20 [Notes.html#C8F20]While the impact of Putin’s strategy on the 2016 election will never be known,it is certainly evident that Americans are relatively cynical regarding thevalues of democracy. Overall, the share of Americans who reject democracy ismore than double the share in the wealthy democracies of Europe.21[Notes.html#C8F21] That sentiment includes right-wing fringe groups such aswhite supremacists empowered by President Trump in the wake of theCharlottesville riot. More problematic, it includes too many American youths.Those who consider a democratic system to be a “bad” or “very bad” way to run anation are only a fringe among youths aged 12 to 24 in peer nations, but reflectthe opinions of nearly 25 percent of American youths.22 [Notes.html#C8F22][images/star.jpg]The greater support for democracy in northern Europe reflects their historicalexperience with fascism and communism. But it also reflects in some measure themore robust economic outcomes yielded by these higher quality democracies. Theircitizens have a lifetime of experience with the practices of home-grown firms.These include prioritizing the creation of high-value domestic jobs and steadilyrising real wages—practices demanded by lawmakers in Germany and elsewhereresponding to the preferences of voters.The lower quality of American democracy enables US firms to eschew suchpractices. And foreign investment by American multinationals in recent decadeshas enabled Canadians and northern Europeans to experience firsthand theconsequential behaviors and antics of US enterprises. Those antics had souredthem on the America variant of capitalism even before the 2016 election outcome."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 9 [Contents.html#CH09][images/common.jpg]International Dismay with the Variant of Capitalism Produced by Low-QualityAmerican Democracy [Contents.html#CH09a][England is] being shown a thing or two by its German rivals about fosteringyoung talent, learning from mistakes and planning for the long term . . . Theascent, on and off the pitch, has not been lost on UK observers, withpolicymakers across the political spectrum looking to Germany for economicinspiration.1 [Notes.html#C9F01]—Chris Bryant, Brian Groom, Michael Steen, and James Wilson, Financial Times,May 2013[T]he United States, by many of the standard indicators of inequality, is nowthe most unequal long-standing democracy in a developed country in the world.2[Notes.html#C9F02]—Alfred Stepan and Juan Linz, Perspective on Politics, December 2011AMAZON IS AN EXEMPLAR of American-style capitalism, seizing market share inAmerica and Europe in numerous business lines. Its profits are built on processand product innovation but also on vigorous wage suppression. The lack of votersovereignty in American permits it to pursue practices that are forbidden tocompetitors in higher quality democracies. At home, it exploits loopholes inlabor laws first opened by the Reagan administration to commoditize its workforce—combining weak wages, paltry benefits, and low job security with manifesthostility to labor unions and collective bargaining. An investigation by the NewYork Times in 2015 highlighted Amazon’s bruising worksite culture, centered ongenerating workplace stress—with supervisors encouraging conflict and peercriticism between workers to spur more innovation.Amazon lugs this same culture overseas wherever it can. The sharp contrast ofits practices with those of firms in higher quality democracies engendersresentment abroad from even surprising quarters. For instance, Amazon is a largeemployer in the former coal mining town of Rugeley in Staffordshire, England. Itwas a dying town that initially heartily welcomed the new mail-order jobs. TheDistrict Council’s economic development manager, Glenn Watson, has since becomedismayed by Amazon’s culture: “They’re not seen as a good employer . . . Ourdefinition of a good employer is someone who takes on people and provides themwith sustainable employment week in week out, not somebody who takes on workersone week and gets rid of them the next . . . We had no idea Amazon was going tobe as indifferent to these issues as they have been. It’s come as a shock to ushow intransigent they are.”3 [Notes.html#C9F03]The treatment of employees by Amazon in Germany is similar. Amazon provides itsGerman employees with scant benefits and a pay scale that’s 25 percent belowprevailing employer–employee agreements for similar mail-order work. And to keepit that way, Amazon relentlessly fights German unions seeking to organize itsemployees. That stonewalling also enables it to install US-style gig-employmentpractices, including reliance on low-paid, insecure, temp jobs as in Rugeley;the temporary employee share of Amazon’s German workforce is double that atcompetitors such as Otto or Hermes Fulfillment.4 [Notes.html#C9F04]Nor is Amazon an exception. Other nameplate firms like Apple and Honeywell alsopursue the same strategy of suppressing wages and resisting collectivebargaining. In Australia in 2016, for example, Coca-Cola incited a nationwideboycott with plans to cut wages for its fifty-six higher-wage employees at itsAbbotsford facility. The plans were withdrawn, but Coca-Cola did not learn alesson. In 2017, Coca-Cola promised a hefty immediate retirement bonus if seniorworkers at its Richlands, Australia, bottling facility agreed to weaker rulesand double-digit wage cuts for junior colleagues—a tactic one labor leadertermed “a real mate against mate scenario . . . They’re trying to get rid of anexisting workforce (as at Abbotsford) and hire people to do the same job at ahell of a lot less pay . . . They’re going to cop a huge decrease in earningsover their lifetime.”5 [Notes.html#C9F05]American multinationals like Amazon and Coca-Cola despise the high-wage andcollaborative stakeholder capitalism in the higher quality democracies ofAustralia, Canada, and much of Europe. Yet, in order to gain access to therichest consumer markets on earth, they have been forced to reach someaccommodation with the European middle-class economic model. Across the EU, forexample, there are more than 1,050 domestic and foreign firms with workscouncils covering 19 million employees. (Recall that works councils arelabor/management committees that substitute for what would be midmanagement inUS firms.) Some 171 of these firms are US multinationals, because anynon-European firm with more than 150 employees in two or more EU nations mustestablish works councils. It has been a positive experience, with many Americanmanagers proving able to operate profitably in the EU high-wage environmentwhere collaboration between workers and management is the norm. Works councilscannot dictate pay or avoid job layoffs, but as a former UK Minister for Europeexplains, “they are an important mechanism for workers employed by the same firmto keep in touch and for the senior managers to hear about and try and resolveproblems before they turn conflictual.”6 [Notes.html#C9F06]US firms have proven far more hostile to the concept of codetermination,commonplace among all large firms in nineteen nations of the EU. By law,corporate boards of directors at larger firms in these nations must includeemployee representatives.7 [Notes.html#C9F07] One-half of the directors at everyGerman firm you can name, for instance, are elected by employees while the otherhalf are elected by shareholders. This collaboration by employees and employersis more than fifty years old. It has a stabilizing influence and accounts forthe longer term business horizon and superior investment performance of Europeanfirms compared to their US competitors. It explains why job offshoring is rarein Europe, as noted earlier, and why rising real wages, sound benefits, employeeup-skilling, and secure retirements are common.8 [Notes.html#C9F08] Employees innations like Denmark, France, and Germany earn more per hour, with wages broadlyset through collective bargaining. That’s why they have enjoyed real wage gainssince 1981 that vastly exceed the gains made by 95 percent of US employees. Andrecall that more of them work than in America.High Wages, No Employee SubsidiesThe higher wages, greater economic mobility, and superior living standardscompared to the United States reflect the higher quality of democracy innorthern Europe. European voters demand that firms pay well enough to avoidtaxpayers having to subsidize their employees. In contrast, the US Congress payslittle heed to middle-class concerns or raising wages, more focused on theagenda of the fittest fifty. They enhance profits by permitting firms to payunduly low wages, insisting that taxpayers make up the difference by fundingfood stamps, Medicaid, and the like used by their poorly paid employees. Theconsequence is that wages at the largest US employers such as fast food firms orWalmart are so low that hundreds of thousands of their employees routinely relyon public assistance. Economists have concluded that taxpayers provide nearly $7billion in food stamps, Medicaid, Children’s Health Insurance, and other incomesupplements for fast food employees.9 [Notes.html#C9F09] Data on Walmart israre, but equally revealing: some 15,246 Walmart employees in Ohio, for example,during 2009 relied on Medicaid and 12,731 utilized food stamps.10[Notes.html#C9F10] And Walmart employees in Wisconsin receive more than $5,800apiece annually in taxpayer funded Medicaid benefits, according to BusinessWeek.11 [Notes.html#C9F11] Overall, Americans for Tax Fairness found thatWalmart employees receive as much as $6.2 billion in taxpayer funds annually forfood, health, and other low-income supports.12 [Notes.html#C9F12]Too many of the fittest fifty believe that too much is never enough, exemplifiedby the four major Walton heirs. Their fortunes rose by $20.9 billion betweenMarch 2014 and March 2015. For one-half that amount, each Walmart employee couldhave received a $5-per-hour raise, ending all taxpayer subsidies.13[Notes.html#C9F13]Foreign Distrust of American EnterprisesInformed by the practices of home-grown firms, exposure to the practicescommonplace with American multinationals have caused Canadians and Europeans togrow wary, viewing them with nearly the same trepidation they reserve forChinese firms. The reputation of American firms abroad reflects the antics offirms such as Amazon but also lingering memories of practices at US firms likeWalmart before it abandoned the German market a decade or so ago. Walmartdeparted in disgrace for encouraging employees at its eighty-five stores toeavesdrop on one another, their policy reminiscent of Soviet and fascist regimesfrom recent history. In combination with Walmart’s attempts to undercut theGerman wage structure, such antics proved simply too much for continentalconsumers.14 [Notes.html#C9F14] They shopped at competitors they consideredbetter corporate citizens.The poor reputation of American-style capitalism in Europe also reflectsbehavior like that of the US auto firm Molex. It closed its factory inVillemur-sur-Tarn, Haute-Garonne, in October 2009, leaving unpaid about €4million ($4.4 million) in wages to its nearly three hundred French employees.Not only did it embarrassingly haul away valuable equipment in the middle of thenight, Molex subsequently reported record profits, including paying out a 14percent dividend.15 [Notes.html#C9F15]Bitterness and recriminations have also followed the takeover of localenterprises abroad by US firms. Eager to acquire cutting edge railway locomotiontechnology, for example, Caterpillar purchased Electro-Motive Canada fromGeneral Motors in 2010. GM had paid Canadian-scale wages in line with Europeanwages at Electro-Motive that were well above US wages. Caterpillar’s takeovercalculations included reaping savings with large wage cutbacks to US levels.Despite record profits in 2011, Caterpillar demanded significant wageconcessions from its new Canadian employees soon after the purchase. In thecommon American style, its demands featured a threat to close Electro-Motive andtransfer its technology to a plant in a lower-wage country—Muncie, Indiana, inthis instance. Canadian employees resisted and Caterpillar promptly closed theplant. Also in the usual American style, Caterpillar demanded that firedCanadian employees first train their foreign (American) low-wage replacements.Rachel Mendleson of Huffington Post Canada explained Caterpillar’s tactics thisway: “Contract talks broke down after union leaders refused a deal that wouldhave cut benefits and slashed wages by more than half, from $35 to $16.50 perhour, giving rise to rumors that the company was planning to shift operations toa newly opened plant in Muncie, Ind., where workers are paid between $12 and $18an hour.”16 [Notes.html#C9F16]Many US multinationals are innovative, some remarkably so. But virtually allbehave like the blue-chip firms Amazon, Caterpillar, and Coca-Cola. They dodgeregulations, provide extravagant executive compensation too often delinked fromperformance, are serial practitioners of the independent contractor andgig-employment scams to lower wages, buy votes in Congress and the courts withdonations, are serial tax dodgers utilizing foreign tax havens, are chronicexporters of high-value jobs, and strongly resist collective bargaining tosuppress wages and spike profits.Foreign observers have tumbled to these pathologies and logically have come todistrust American firms. Evidence comes from an expansive database compiled bythe Edelman public relations firm. As an occasional element of its annualsurveys, it garners opinion toward American firms by informed citizens innorthern Europe, Canada, and elsewhere; respondents are described by theFinancial Times as “well-educated, highly paid and engaged 25–64 year olds.”17[Notes.html#C9F17] The surveys reveal that “US Companies Have a Trust Deficit inEurope.” In a detailed 2006 Edelman survey, for example, reproduced as chart9.1, about 70 percent of elite Germans trusted the management and boards ofGerman or Canadian firms “to do the right thing,” by sharing their prosperitywith employees and customers; only 41 percent had the same trust in leadershipof American firms. Indeed, the behavior of American management is viewed withonly slightly more favor than that anticipated from the owners of Chinese firms.American firms were consistently ranked as markedly less trustworthy than eitherCanadian firms or indigenous firms by elites in Canada, France, Germany, and theUnited Kingdom.18 [Notes.html#C9F18]The trust deficit documented in chart 9.1 also applied to specific iconicAmerican firms. The 2006 Edelman survey found that its European respondents hada significant trust deficit with major US corporations such as Coca-Cola,General Electric, Johnson & Johnson, McDonald’s, and Starbucks. That distrustmeans foreign observers view these firms considerably less favorably than doAmericans themselves. Some 65 percent of American participants in the surveyviewed Coca-Cola as trustworthy, for example, while only 41 percent of Europeanrespondents did so (chart 9.2).19 [Notes.html#C9F19] The marks for McDonald’swere particularly low. As professor Tony Royle at the National University ofIreland explains, its outlets in Europe have become notorious for resistingcollective bargaining, violating wage standards, manipulating low-wage programsintended solely for trainees, and ignoring labor regulations. Like Amazon orWalmart, that firm is determined to exploit loopholes to pay American-stylewages rather than higher European ones.20 [Notes.html#C9F20][images/pg131.jpg]Chart 9.1 Responses to “How Much Do You Trust Global Companies Headquartered inthe Following Countries to Do What Is Right?”2006 Annual Edelman Trust Barometer, “Trust in Companies Headquartered in OtherCountries,”http://www.yooyahcloud.com/MOSSCOMMUNICATIONS/ftFsP/Edelman_Trust_Barometer.pdf[http://www.yooyahcloud.com/MOSSCOMMUNICATIONS/ftFsP/Edelman_Trust_Barometer.pdf][images/pg131a.jpg]Chart 9.2 Responses to “Do You Trust [firm] to Do the Right Thing?”2006 Annual Edelman Trust Barometer, “Trust in Companies Headquartered in OtherCountries.”Jaundiced sentiment about American business practices based on unfavorablecomparisons with domestic firms is pervasive in other wealthy democracies,including Canada. The prospect of a takeover of local firms by American ones isthus viewed with alarm. The 2006 Edelman survey included questions on the extentof unease should American, European, Chinese, South Korean, or Indian firms seekto acquire local firms. The degree of dismay at the prospect of US takeovers wasdramatically worse than for firms from any other wealthy democracy, includingJapanese firms. Only potential takeovers by Chinese firms were viewed with moreconcern (chart 9.3). Indeed, respondents in Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom,and France viewed American takeovers with more mistrust than they did takeoversby firms from India; they prefer local firms being taken over by Indiancorporations than by American corporations. Overall, among Germans, theintensity of dismay should US firms buy out German firms was a stunningtwenty-two times greater than for Japanese takeovers, and five to seven timesgreater than for takeovers by firms from their historic adversaries in France orBritain.[images/pg132.jpg]Chart 9.3 Mistrust of takeover by foreign firms.2006 Annual Edelman Trust Barometer, page 13, “Mistrust in Foreign CompaniesAcquiring National Companies,”www.yooyahcloud.com/MOSSCOMMUNICATIONS/ftFsP/Edelman_Trust_Barometer.pdf[http://www.yooyahcloud.com/MOSSCOMMUNICATIONS/ftFsP/Edelman_Trust_Barometer.pdf]Europeans are decidedly unimpressed with the wages, job security, and otherlabor practices of US firms chiseled by Ronald Reagan and Ayn Rand onto tabletsatop Mont Pelerin.

Political practices responsible for ahigher quality of democracy abroad start with the criminalization of votebuying. While necessary, that step alone is insufficient. Higher qualitydemocracies also feature electoral characteristics that empower politicalequality, particularly multiple-member legislative districts, runoff voting fornational leaders, mandatory voting as in Australia, and proportionalrepresentation in legislatures (what political scientists term “single votetransferable electoral vote systems”).The various electoral policies and practices utilized abroad to corral economicelites and sustain political equality begin this section."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 10 [Contents.html#CH010][images/common.jpg]Other Wealthy Democracies Corral Oligarchs [Contents.html#CH010a]Britain’s Parties Should be Funded [entirely] by the State.1 [Notes.html#C10F01]—Financial Times editorial, February 2015Our politicians hire American electoral advisers as though Washington andWestminster were comparable polities. When they arrive, they see they cannot buytelevision advertising, or raise serious sums of money, or treat the election asa two-party race, and they quietly recede.2 [Notes.html#C10F02]—Janan Ganesh, Financial Times, April 2015In comparison to the US, the UK has what appears to be a tough set of controlson campaign spending.3 [Notes.html#C10F03]—Jacob Rowbottom, The New Republic, 2011AS WE HAVE SEEN in earlier chapters, the American election system is a starkoutlier among wealthy democracies. Nearly all other wealthy democracies tightlyproscribe campaign contributions and independent political spending to preventpolitical inequality, the distortion of public opinion, and corrupted lawmakers.Another goal is to prevent American-style polarization caused by negativeadvertising. The particulars vary, but nearly all mimic Germany and the UnitedKingdom in preventing pay-to-play by sharply capping electioneering campaignspending. With far less scope for electioneering spending than in America,candidates and political parties have far less legitimate need for donations.Moreover, peer nations also subsidize candidates and small donors to furtherfree political parties and candidates from reliance on large donors.These higher quality democracies also restrict political TV and radioadvertising opportunities, with those limited opportunities usually providedfree or inexpensively. Campaigns are limited to a few months in duration aswell. In addition, corporations and entities that are independent of candidatesand political parties (similar to Warren Buffett or the Koch brothers’ Americansfor Prosperity) are prohibited or strictly circumscribed from contributing to,or purchasing political speech during elections on behalf of politicians orpolicies. Thus, American-style negative advertising on TV and elsewhere isabsent, with the glaring exception everywhere of social media.Taken together, this policy array in higher quality democracies affordscandidates abundant communication resources while maximizing political equalityand individual free speech rights. Any person can speak freely for as long asthey choose on any street corner or soapbox on nearly any subject.The Fittest in Other Wealthy Democracies Cannot Outshout NeighborsThere are tight limits on electioneering spending by parties or candidates inhigher quality democracies. For instance, the nationwide campaign spending byGerman chancellor Angela Merkel in 2013 was $27 million.4 [Notes.html#C10F04] Itwas even lower in France in 2012 and 2017. Other tight limits apply to citizendonations and independent spending. Voters in other wealthy democracies arecomfortable with such tight caps. They would be shocked if opaque, powerfulgroups could spend unlimited amounts of money for years to mold public opinionand influence election outcomes—or if individuals such as Sheldon Adelson orPaul Singer were allowed to speak with the voice of tens of millions.Pay-to-play is rejected because peer nations strive mightily to guaranteepolitical equality and voter sovereignty while nurturing a consensus-drivenpolitical middle by supporting electoral and representational integrity. Theycovet these desiderata as pillars of a prosperous democracy rather than as theniceties or novelties they are to the American eye. Indeed, peer nations are sodetermined to avoid vote buying that even the Financial Times—Britain’sequivalent of the Wall Street Journal—rather remarkably demanded in a 2015editorial that private contributions be entirely abolished, with Britishpolitics funded solely by taxpayers: “If the political class at Westminster isto have any chance of winning back public trust, it needs to end the suspicionthat the culture of political donations is corruptible. The only way to do thisis a system of taxpayer funding . . .”5 [Notes.html#C10F05]It’s ironic that Britain—the abhorred example of political corruption forcolonial Americans—has come to hew far more closely than America to both thepolitical equality proclaimed by the Declaration of Independence and theoriginal intent of the founding fathers and the framers to excise all politicalcorruption, defined most broadly.The success of Britain and other wealthy nations in corralling Aristotle’soligarchs and crafting high-quality democracies is a consequence of twocenturies of revolution, debate, and contemplation. It has taken almost thatlong to devise their refined political systems which maximize and equilibrateindividual political freedom, rendering voters sovereign. Precluding vote buyingby strictly limiting the need for donations has emerged as the time-testedtechnique to ensure that citizens are equally heard and equally heeded bylawmakers. Some go further and actually impose de jure limits on the amount ofdonations by individuals and independent entities, while others such as Britaindon’t bother. It makes no practical difference because the operational keypreventing pay-to-play is national caps on electioneering spending. Candidatesor their parties cannot legally spend many tens of millions of dollarsAmerican-style to win political office.Australia is the only wealthy democracy other than the United States to allowunlimited political donations and independent third-party political spending,including by corporations. The similarities end there, however, becauseAustralian pay-to-play is on a tiny scale. The ten biggest donor corporations,for instance, contributed a total of US$3 million during the 2016 generalelection there—a rounding error in American pay-to-play.6 [Notes.html#C10F06]The other Anglo-Saxon nations (Canada, New Zealand, and Britain) follow thehigh-quality democracies of Europe in severely limiting overall electioneeringspending—de facto or de jure tightly capping campaign donations and independentspending while prohibiting corporate donations.(Genuine) Free SpeechWe saw earlier that Roberts Republicans conflate the First Amendment guaranteeof speech content with speech volume or amount. They do so by treating money ashaving the same validity as speech, thereby enabling the fittest to insist thatlimits on their political contributions and independent spending amount tocensorship of constitutionally protected free speech. Their self-serving claimswould be jeered at in nearly all other democracies. Limits on the donor class inwealthy democracies such as Canada are not considered censorship because thecaps serve to maximize speech equality and thus maximize individual speechrights. In other wealthy democracies, the right of individual citizens to saytheir piece as often as possible is a political foundation. The German versionsof Charles Koch can opine endlessly on street corners and elsewhere, but theycannot rent a sound-truck or purchase TV spots to drown out their neighbors’opinions. As of this writing, however, the fittest fifty can purchase unlimitedexposure on social media, a deficiency discussed later.How well does this formulation abroad maximize individual speech rights? Well,the conservative Freedom House’s iconic “Freedom in the World” index grantsthese peers the same perfect scores awarded the United States under all three ofits free speech categories—“Freedom,” “Political Rights,” and “CivilLiberties.”7 [Notes.html#C10F07]Political Systems in Other Wealthy DemocraciesAs noted, limits on electioneering spending in nearly all peer nations are setsufficiently low to obviate the need for large donations. Tobias Döring andChristof Kerkmann writing in the Düsseldorf-based Handelsblatt described thefeverish final weeks in the 2013 German elections this way: “The electioncampaign is in the final sprint. Billboards, online advertising and a lot ofpens.”8 [Notes.html#C10F08]More than seventy nations further reduce the need for private campaign donationsby providing candidates with public funding to defray electioneering costs. Thegoal is to avail citizens of a factual, full airing of genuine policydifferences between candidates and between political parties. The outcome isrobust and highly competitive elections where the weight of ideas and policyprescriptions are determinant rather than weight of wallet.European nations provide candidates and their political parties an average ofabout $5 per voter in public funding with the greatest level at $15 in Norway.9[Notes.html#C10F09] Such subsidies represent about 40 percent of spending bycandidates and political parties over an election cycle. In France, forinstance, public subsidies equal 47.5 percent of permitted electioneeringspending.10 [Notes.html#C10F10] The balance of campaign funding is derived fromsmall donations, typically incentivized by tax credit as in Canada, France, andGermany. Political parties in Germany garnering 0.5 percent of votes forBundestag (federal) candidates receive €1 ($1.10) for each of their first 4million votes and 83 cents per vote received thereafter, with an upper cap ontax credits granted for individual and total donations.11 [Notes.html#C10F11]Combining a limited need for campaign donations with public funding hassuccessfully freed lawmakers from reliance on wealthy contributors. The proof isvoter sovereignty: Policy outcomes of other wealthy democracies do not reflectan American-style income bias. Cynics argue that political bribery is soprofitable that money inevitably leeches into politics regardless of rules. Butthat assertion is belied by evidence in peer nations of the efficacy of theircomprehensive monitoring and their aggressive enforcement of spending rules.Indeed, exposés of dubious campaign finance practices routinely cause electoralblowback: Voters in these nations harshly punish parties or candidates whoappear implicated in vote buying. For instance, disgusted Germans voted out theentire Free Democratic Party’s (FDP) parliamentary delegation following adonation exposé in 2013. The FDP had opened a tax loophole after receiving a €1million contribution from August von Finck, the billionaire owner of theMövenpick hotel empire.12 [Notes.html#C10F12]Here are specifics from the UK, Canada, and Northern European electoral systems.United KingdomTotal electioneering spending per campaign in the United Kingdom is capped bylaw at about $150 million. That includes spending by parliamentary candidates,which is capped at £39,400 (about $50,000) apiece plus a 9 pence (11 cents)per-voter bonus. A separate nationwide cap of £19.5 million ($24 million) existsfor each major political party over the year concluding on Election Day.13[Notes.html#C10F13] Quite remarkably, these caps have remained in thatneighborhood (in inflation-adjusted terms) for 135 years since politicalspending was first limited by the 1883 reforms to end vote buying. You read thatdate correctly. Electioneering spending since then has been capped at aboutone-half the cost of the 1880 campaign, with no evident deterioration in Britishdemocracy.14 [Notes.html#C10F14] These limits, of course, are a tiny fraction ofUS spending. The amount spent in the last English national campaign roughlyequals the political spending during the 2014 midterm election in the state ofGeorgia.15 [Notes.html#C10F15] And more was spent by candidates Obama and Romneyraising money in 2012 than was spent in total by the two major British politicalparties.16 [Notes.html#C10F16]In further dramatic contrast with the United States, where candidates rush toreserve popular TV times and digital access, candidates in England rush toreserve, well, scarce billboards. Political advertising is restricted toleaflets, canvassing, billboards, and social media, supplemented with free butlimited TV time and one free mass mailing to every residence. Like nearly everyother wealthy democracy, political spending by independent entities, includingdonations, advertising, or issue advocacy, is limited. The specific UK cap onsuch independent spending per entity nationwide (such as Warren Buffett orCharles Koch) is £988,000 ($1,200,000) during the entire one-year periodconcluding with Election Day.17 [Notes.html#C10F17] New York Times journalistSteven Castle explains the impact of this system:In a country where television election spots are banned, billboards are bookedlong before voting day, and other strict laws constrain election spending, thattask proved so hard that the [UKIP] party says it is unlikely to use all themoney before Britons go to the polls . . . Campaigning in Britain remains local,with candidates pounding the streets, knocking on doors, issuing leaflets andsending mail. Even these expenditures have to be recorded in minute detail andsubmitted to the election authorities. Spending limits also apply toorganizations like charities or unions that want to campaign ahead ofelections.18 [Notes.html#C10F18]Like Canada and its richer European neighbors, Britain finances elections with ablend of state subsidies allocated on a per capita basis, supplemented withprivate donations that are tightly capped by law at small amounts.19[Notes.html#C10F19] This array of regulations devised since 1883 prevent theBritish fittest from influencing elections—with the exception of press baronslike Rupert Murdoch, as noted later.Even so, the United Kingdom’s electoral system shares two features with Americathat reduce the quality of its democracy. Parliamentarians representsingle-member districts—giving rise to both millions of wasted votes andgerrymandering. Single-member districts mean all voters for the loser areunrepresented in the legislature, unlike outcomes in proportional representationsystems, discussed later, that are common in higher quality democracies.Proportional systems also prevent gerrymandering.CanadaLike Britain, Canada caps donations for national elections, includingparliamentary contests. A few provinces such as British Columbia do permit largedonations to candidates seeking provincial or local offices. In contrast,donation limits for such contests in other provinces (Alberta, Manitoba, NovaScotia, Ontario, and Quebec) are much tighter than national limits.20[Notes.html#C10F20]Electioneering spending is also limited in Canada to reduce the need for privatecampaign donations.21 [Notes.html#C10F21] For candidates in the general electionin October 2015, for instance, the caps on electioneering spending varied bypopulation in each Riding (electoral district), but averaged slightly overC$200,000 ($150,000) for individual federal parliamentary candidates. The capwas C$55 million ($43 million) for each of the leading political parties or inthe neighborhood of C$250 million combined for all parties. The entirety ofpolitical advertising on television is limited to about ten hours during the twoto three months of campaigning, with some airtime provided free.22[Notes.html#C10F22] Political TV ads purchased by independent third parties arepermitted but severely limited in number. Consequently, Canadians are subject toa fraction of the number of 30-second political spots that Americans see. Theirnationwide total is equivalent to what viewers in some US media marketsexperience over a weekend in election season.23 [Notes.html#C10F23] Such capsare prevalent across continental Europe as well. In Germany for instance,Chancellor Merkel’s campaign sponsored a total of 140 TV ads in 2013, comparedto 100,000 by President Obama in 2012 just in Ohio.24 [Notes.html#C10F24]Note that these electioneering spending caps are ceilings. Actual Canadianoutlays traditionally are lower because amounts hinge on the good graces ofsmall donors. That means amounts spent by individual candidates and parties inelections vary a great deal depending on their popularity, although major partycandidates tend to achieve a rough spending parity. Like other higher qualitydemocracies, Canada provides public funding to ensure that all candidates whoqualify for the ballot have adequate communications opportunity. The subsidiescan total as much as one-half of all permitted spending by political parties andup to 60 percent of permitted spending by candidates themselves.25[Notes.html#C10F25]Individual campaign contributions are limited to no more than C$4,575 (US$3,400)per annum (indexed for inflation), including C$1,525 in total permitted to bedonated to political parties, up to another C$1,525 to candidate(s), and anotherC$1,525 to candidates should an intraparty leadership contest occur.26[Notes.html#C10F26] Donors of more than C$200 must be identified by name. Donorsof more than C$200 to independent outside entities must also appear on allensuing political advertising. Wealthy candidates are limited to just C$5,000 incontributions to their own campaigns.27 [Notes.html#C10F27]Independent political spending by outside entities is also strictly limited. IfGeorge Soros and the Koch brothers were Canadians, they would have been limitedto donations or spending in 2015 of slightly more than C$208,200 (US$155,000).28[Notes.html#C10F28] Note that these caps apply for the usual thirty-seven daycampaign; they were adjusted upward proportionately in 2015 because the generalelection ran seventy-eight days.29 [Notes.html#C10F29] Perhaps Canada’s largestremaining loophole is that huge donations are still permitted to foundations oruniversities favored by politicians.30 [Notes.html#C10F30] Such donations canobviously curry favor.Donors to independent entities must be publicly identified. Moreover, thedefinition of political spending and donations subject to these rules utilizedby Elections Canada (the federal election supervisor) is encompassing. It coversany political spending involving the “transmission to the public by any meansduring any election period of an advertising message that promotes or opposes aregistered party or the election of a candidate, including one that takes aposition on an issue with which a registered party or candidate isassociated.”31 [Notes.html#C10F31]Elections Canada is vigilant for attempts by wealthy political activists to useindependent entities to bypass spending limits: “A third party shall notcircumvent, or attempt to circumvent, a limit set out in section 350 in anymanner, including by splitting itself into two or more third parties for thepurpose of circumventing the limit or acting in collusion with another thirdparty so that their combined election advertising expenses exceed the limit”(section 351, Canadian Elections Act).32 [Notes.html#C10F32] Conservatives havepleaded with the Canadian Supreme Court to nullify these limits on independentpolitical spending in hopes of enabling American-style PACs to flourish. Verymuch unlike America, however, Canadian electoral jurisprudence is nonpartisan,mirroring that of nearly all other higher quality democracies, and hasconsistently affirmed support of independent spending limits. The Court’s logicis explained in the landmark ruling Harper v. Canada (2004):Unlimited third party advertising can undermine election fairness in severalways. First, it can lead to dominance of political discourse by the wealthy . .. Second it may allow political parties and candidates to circumvent their ownspending limits through the creation of third parties. Third, unlimited thirdparty spending can have an unfair effect on the outcome of an election. Fourth,the absence of limits on third party advertising expenses can erode theconfidence of the Canadian electorate who perceive the electoral process asbeing dominated by the wealthy.33 [Notes.html#C10F33]Western EuropeAs in Canada and the UK, electioneering spending limits are commonplace in thewealthy democracies of Europe. Total spending by all Swiss political parties inthe run-up to the 2011 general election was SF44 million ($50 million), forinstance.34 [Notes.html#C10F34] In France, each political party in the 2017presidential campaign was capped at €16.8 million ($18 million) and another€22.5 million ($24 million) for the binary runoff.35 [Notes.html#C10F35]Political party spending is limited in Italy by law to €96 million ($105million), funded with a blend of private donations and public subsidies (tiedper capita to votes and donations received).36 [Notes.html#C10F36] In Germany asnoted, caps held the reelection campaign spending of German chancellor AngelaMerkel in 2013 to $27 million. German spending by legislative candidates is alsocapped. For example, total nationwide electioneering spending by Merkel’s entireChristian Democratic Union slate four years earlier involving campaigns for 598parliament races, six state legislatures, and numerous regional and municipalelections was $112 million.37 [Notes.html#C10F37] That is not much more than the$93 million that Sheldon Adelson alone spent in 2012 and less than one-sixth ofthe $750 million spent over the 2016 election cycle by the Koch politicalbehemoth.Caps on independent spending mean that American-style purchased speech is eithernonexistent or quite limited in Europe, Canada, and Britain. Candidates informvoters utilizing free or inexpensive TV advertising, supplemented by print,social media, canvassing, leaflets, and billboards. Campaign lengths arelimited, reaching sixty days in France, up to seventy-eight days in Canada, upto thirty-five days in Australia, and six weeks in Germany. And elections aretypically conducted on Sundays to make voting convenient for workers. Voterregistration is automated.[images/star.jpg]The election processes in superior democracies offer lessons for improving thequality of American democracy. The first step is an end to pay-to-play. And thatstep depends on the Supreme Court. As American politics unfolded after 2016 withthe appointment of Judge Gorsuch, the Buckley era seems likely to persist forsome years. In the future, recriminalizing vote buying hinges on a reconstitutedSupreme Court willing to reassert originalism, hewing to the framers’ intent toprevent corruption. That reassertion must rest on a clear understanding of thevarious rationales justifying an end to the Buckley era, examined in the nextchapter."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 11 [Contents.html#CH011][images/common.jpg]Recriminalizing Vote Buying [Contents.html#CH011a]Nor shall any person holding any office of profit or trust under the UnitedStates, or any of them, accept any present, emolument, office or title of anykind.1 [Notes.html#C11F01]—Articles of Confederation, 1777If access to political power in a democracy becomes purchasable, governmentsturn into bazaars made up not of elected officials who govern according to law,but of entrepreneurs who sell their wares to the highest bidder.2[Notes.html#C11F02]—David Crossland, Berliner Zeitung, February 2010IT IS THE MOST famous presidential speech in American history. Lincoln’sGettysburg address is lionized by historians. It eloquently consecrated thesacrifice of the thousands of American sons, brothers, and husbands who fell onthe battlefield. But Lincoln’s 272 words were not only a moving tribute to thefallen. He also sought to resurrect the foundation of the nation set forth inthe Declaration of Independence by the Second Continental Congress. Indeed, theRepublican Party emerged in 1854, built on Abraham Lincoln’s intention. GarryWills, Pulitzer Prize winning historian, explains that Lincoln rejected thediscriminatory, selective liberty embodied in the Constitution in favor ofindividual equality as the seminal inspiration and principle for Americandemocracy.3 [Notes.html#C11F03] On that November afternoon in 1863, Lincolnspoke of lifting from the nation the dead hand of a constitution empowering aslaveocracy and political inequality.Lincoln invoked the better angels in all Americans. But his call—like the 1776vision of Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, John Jay, the abolitionists, advocatesof women’s rights, and others—would fail. The Jim Crow era, empowered byembarrassing supreme courts, would soon follow. Indeed, Lincoln’s hope remainsunfulfilled as you read this. Political equality has been repeatedly rejected byBuckley era supreme courts in mimicry of the nineteenth-century Chase, Waite,and Fuller courts. American democracy is low quality because representativesneither fairly hear nor heed citizens. The Buckley genre sustains a criminalizedpolitical system that disrupts both the electoral integrity and representationalequality that are central features of higher quality democracies. Yes, there areadditional factors contributing to America’s poor quality of democracy includingthe Electoral College and the severely malapportioned Senate. But ending theBuckley era is the crucial step—an epochal reform that hinges solely onrecomposition of the Supreme Court. That is a prerequisite for Lincoln’s hope ofindividual equality to be realized.The Roberts Republicans may hope that their rulings have firmly placed theincome bias at the center of American democracy—that the Buckley genre hasdefinitively tipped the scales against original intent and two centuries ofjudicial precedent and jurisprudence. The late Justice Scalia asserted inWilliams-Yulee v. Florida Bar (2015), for instance, that pay-to-play is a“settled First Amendment principle . . .”4 [Notes.html#C11F04] Their hopes arecertain to be thwarted at some point by judicial review.Episodes of abandonment of original intent like the Buckley era are not unusualin the history of the Supreme Court, whose dynamics are routinely influenced bypersonal preferences, events, better information, or turnover. In fact, theforemost conservative American jurist, Judge Posner, argues that the evolutionin Supreme Court rulings regarding vote buying (especially after 2006 whenJustice Samuel Alito replaced the retiring Justice Sandra Day O’Connor)“underscores the question of the personal and political elements in judging andthus of the sense in which the nation is ruled by judges rather than by law.”5[Notes.html#C11F05]It is ironic that the practice of judicial review utilized since 1976 todecriminalize vote buying is also the pathway for its remediation. Theconstitutional shield for corruption erected by the Burger, Rehnquist, andRoberts courts rests on quicksand, not original intent. The lottery ofappointment and lifespan will assuredly produce at some future date aprogressive Supreme Court majority willing to hew to original intent. That courtcan seek comfort by looking to rulings beginning in 1937, which began to balancethe economics of labor and capital and bring life finally to the New Dealagenda.6 [Notes.html#C11F06] That and subsequent courts lifted the dead hand ofeconomic Darwinism from Americans for nearly half a century, temporarilycreating the grandest middle class in history. And a future one will have therare opportunity, as historian James MacGregor Burns wrote of the Earl WarrenCourt, “to forge a luminous exception to the Court’s historic role as thebulwark of anti-democratic, anti-egalitarian conservatism . . .”7[Notes.html#C11F07]Indeed, Supreme Court turnover in the past has produced seismic new directionsin national policy. Courts embracing Jim Crow and apartheid, beginning with the1873 Slaughterhouse ruling, eventually gave way generations later to the WarrenCourt and its 1954 ruling in Brown v. Board of Education, reasserting themeaning and intent of the Fourteenth Amendment. And a new court configurationwill eventually install political equality and voter sovereignty by ending votebuying as the foundational principle of American democracy.The fittest fifty and small-government conservatives have benefiteddisproportionately from the Buckley genre. But some conservatives are keenlyaware that the Buckley era is on shaky ground, resting entirely on a court ofdynamic composition. It was instructive that soon after the passing of JusticeScalia, the Koch behemoth began spending $42 million in attack ads against sixDemocratic senate candidates such as Ted Strickland to (successfully) ensurecontinued GOP control of the Senate in 2016.8 [Notes.html#C11F08]The Kochs have reason to fear recomposition of the Supreme Court. Limits oncampaign donations (including by foreigners and some military personnel) havebeen constitutional since 1867. Limits on political speech itself arecommonplace in America, including fastidious rules for local governmentmeetings, polling stations, state and federal legislative hearings, courtrooms,and the like. Moreover, supreme courts in the past have issued rulingsexplicitly to improve political equality, including Reynolds v. Sims (1964)requiring one person one vote.And then there is original intent. The founding fathers and the framers soughtto prohibit vote buying, determined to avoid the judgment of public officialsbeing distorted by “interested men” bearing gifts or campaign donations.Acknowledging this original intent by recriminalizing vote buying to minimizecorruption is the most compelling rationale within the American constitutionalframework for ending pay-to-play. But there are other justifications, includingmaximizing political equality, enhancing electoral integrity, strengtheningFirst Amendment individual speech rights, and removing the advantages affordedincumbency by pay-to-play to render voters sovereign by reducing the incomebias. Each is a vital national interest.Minimizing CorruptionThe founders’ and the framers’ concern with vote buying was a culmination of theanticorruption themes in the writings of Plato, Edmund Burke, and Montesquieu aswell as the 1651 Dutch law forbidding even trivial “gifts” to public officials.The founders’ intent was a sine qua non for states as they began writing theirown charters and constitutions, and creating legislatures in the wake of theSecond Continental Congress in 1776. In instructing the members of Congressscattering back to their states (while dodging Redcoats) to lead these trulyremarkable events, John Adam admonished: “Great care should be taken to effectthis, and to prevent unfair, partial, and corrupt elections.”9[Notes.html#C11F09] Moreover, as noted in the introduction, unabashed oppositionto corruption in any guise was written into the Articles of Confederation thefounding fathers soon crafted: “Nor shall any person holding any office ofprofit or trust under the United States, or any of them, accept any present,emolument, office or title of any kind.”10 [Notes.html#C11F10]The founding fathers could not have more forcefully provided future generationswith clarity of their intent. A decade later, in 1787, the framers were equallyadamant, exemplified by the concerns of James Madison and George Mason, noted inchapter 3 [Chapter03.html]. That is why they included more than twentyanticorruption provisions in the Constitution—more than any other topic. As inthe Articles, their definition of corruption was all encompassing. Constitutionscholars like Robert Post have emphasized that the framers had an obsessivefocus on indirect as well as quid pro quo corruption. Their definition of votebuying was perceived in the broadest possible terms—exemplified by their concernover King George III’s suborning of parliamentarians. Royal grants wereconsidered corrupting regardless of whether any quid pro quo occurred. Indeed,even royal grants and emoluments to loyal Tory parliamentarians were viewed ascorruption. Emphasizing this original intent, Justice Sandra Day O’Connor echoedthe founding fathers’ broad definition of corruption in her opinion in McConnellv. FEC (2003), quoted in chapter 7 [Chapter07.html].11 [Notes.html#C11F11]Professor Zephyr Teachout explains their broadest possible definition this way:“[Delegates] started their experiment in self-government committed to expandingthe scope of the actions that were called corrupt to encompass activitiestreated as noncorrupt in British and French cultures . . . [Buckley] isincompatible with the traditional American theory of corruption.”12[Notes.html#C11F12]The founding fathers and the constitutional framers’ criminalization ofpolitical bribery in any form and forum was soon reflected in state statutes.Public officials of the day were generally considered guilty of corruption whenaccepting support even when their votes or behavior went unchanged.13[Notes.html#C11F13] An 1816 statute in Georgia and similar laws that followed inKentucky, Michigan, North Carolina, Minnesota, and other states went well beyondquid pro quo exchanges to quite broadly criminalize political donations of anykind. Teachout explains: “For example, in Michigan, the briber was guilty if hegave something of value ‘with intent to influence his [public official’s] act,vote, decision or judgment on any matter’.”14 [Notes.html#C11F14] Federal lawlater (Acts to Prevent Frauds on the Treasury) similarly criminalized politicaldonations intended to influence a public official’s “vote or decision on anyquestion . . . before him in his official capacity, or in his place of trust orprofit.”15 [Notes.html#C11F15]Colonial era anticorruption statutes expanded to keep pace with the ingenuity offavor seekers, especially following the 1896 McKinley presidential campaign,which rather famously featured voluminous fund-raising from corporate donors bySenator Mark Hanna. Within a decade, the Tillman Act (1907) had criminalizedsuch corporate political donations and independent spending as well. UCLA lawprofessor Adam Winkler writes “in the early 1900s, Congress and the majority ofstate legislatures adopted laws completely barring corporations fromcontributing money to candidates for public office.”16 [Notes.html#C11F16]Included was Montana’s Corrupt Practices Act of 1912, barring corporatepolitical donations and spending by “Copper Kings” and other bribers. Enacted bycitizens’ initiative, this law stood for a century until struck down by theRoberts Republicans in June 2012.Maximizing Political EqualityA second justification for ending pay-to-play is to place political equality atthe center of American democracy, a concept viewed with hostility by RobertsRepublicans. The opportunity for citizens to speak freely and for as long andforcibly as any other citizen should not be infringed by the fittest fifty’sability to purchase television time or sound trucks to speak louder than theirneighbors. As Justice Louis Brandeis concluded in 1920, protecting everycitizen’s speech rights enables and thus promotes direct involvement ingovernment.17 [Notes.html#C11F17] Many American political scientists and somejurists nowadays place political equality at the center of their arguments thatjustify limits on political spending.18 [Notes.html#C11F18] For example, retiredJustice John Paul Stevens believes it is the most compelling argument, becausewith pay-to-play, “The voter is less important than the man who provides moneyto the candidate.”19 [Notes.html#C11F19] And Teachout joins legal theorists suchas Cass Sunstein, Richard Hasen, David Strauss, and Kathleen Sullivan in arguingthat the Buckley genre is designed to strip concerns of equality or inequalityfrom campaign financing laws.20 [Notes.html#C11F20]Every other wealthy democracy has centered its governance model on politicalequality, marking it the global gold standard. Like the United States, freespeech in Canada for instance is a constitutional guarantee. It exaltsprotections on speech content. But unlike the Roberts Republicans, Canada’sSupreme Court has found that political equality is a foundational value to ahigh-quality democracy that justifies limits on speech volume. Over stridentopposition from then-conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper, the CanadianSupreme Court held in the landmark ruling, Harper v. Canada (2004), that suchstrict limits on donations and independent political spending will “create alevel playing field for those who wish to engage in the election discourse.This, in turn, enables voters to be better informed; no one voice is overwhelmedby another . . . Individuals should have an equal opportunity to participate inthe electoral process . . . that requires the wealthy to be prevented fromcontrolling the electoral process to the detriment of others with less economicpower.”21 [Notes.html#C11F21]Judge Guido Calabresi of the Second Circuit Court agreed, writing in 2012:If an external factor, such as wealth, allows some individuals to communicatetheir political views too powerfully, then persons who lack wealth may, for allintents and purposes, be excluded from the democratic dialogue . . .Contribution limits, like noise ordinances, still allow those who have thecapacity a full opportunity to make their speech widely heard . . . but suchlimits make sure that this is done only in ways that leave room for everyoneelse to do the same.22 [Notes.html#C11F22]Calabresi makes a second point, that purchasable political speech lends itselfto misjudgments in the intensity of feelings held by voters:To return to the example of the megaphone in the public square, the problem withits loudness is not just that it drowns out the voices of others, but also thatit misrepresents, to an outside observer, the relative intensity of thespeaker’s views . . . The one speaker’s relative loudness—along with the otherspeakers’ relative softness—obscures the depth of each speaker’s views, therebydegrading the communicative value of everyone’s message . . . The ability toexpress one’s feelings with all the intensity that one has—and to be heard—is acentral element of the right to speak freely . . . Today, the amount of anindividual’s campaign contribution reflects the strength of that individual’spreferences far less than it does the size of his wallet.23 [Notes.html#C11F23]Maximizing Electoral IntegrityRobert Post posits that “electoral integrity” is a more precise justificationfor limiting vote buying than political equality. The outcome is the same: inthe absence of political bribery, public confidence in the democratic process ismaximized because representatives can thereby best hear and heed each citizen.In his book Citizens Divided, Post emphasized that it is paramount for each voteto be equally valued by representatives “because political decisions arecharacteristically imposed on all.”24 [Notes.html#C11F24]Maximizing Individual First Amendment RightsA high-quality democracy features elected representatives who hear citizens’voices equally, or what Post and Justice Stephen Breyer term a sturdy political“chain of communication.” By providing a constitutional shield for unequalpolitical voices, the Buckley genre diminishes the quality, vicissitude, andvariety of speech being heard. That diminishes First Amendment rights, asJustice Breyer explained in his dissent to McCutcheon v. FEC (2014), quoted hereat length:The First Amendment advances not only the individual’s right to engage inpolitical speech, but also the public’s interest in preserving a democraticorder in which collective speech matters. What has this to do with corruption?It has everything to do with corruption. Corruption breaks the constitutionallynecessary “chain of communication” between the people and their representatives.It derails the essential speech-to-government-action tie. Where enough moneycalls the tune, the general public will not be heard. Insofar as corruption cutsthe link between political thought and political action, a free marketplace ofpolitical ideas loses its point. That is one reason why the Court has stressedthe constitutional importance of Congress’ concern that a few large donationsnot drown out the voices of the many.25 [Notes.html#C11F25]The majority opinion in Buckley argues that limits on the volume of politicalspeech will disrupt the constitutional goal of promoting “the unfetteredinterchange of ideas,” diminishing free speech rights. By this illogic, it wouldseem that a sound truck enhances the exchange of ideas while its absenceinhibits such exchanges. In actuality, political equality, electoral integrity,and the chain of communication are enhanced by limits that preserve the freespeech rights of each and every citizen—thereby strengthening an individual’sFirst Amendment rights, as argued by Judge Calabresi:[Unfettered political spending] garbles the political debate, trumpeting voicesthat would otherwise be muted and muting voices that would otherwise betrumpeted . . . the only way to ensure a truly “unfettered interchange ofideas”—an interchange, that is, where each voice is heard in reasonableproportion to the intensity of the beliefs it expresses—is to give thegovernment some freedom to mitigate the fettering impact of theseinequalities.26 [Notes.html#C11F26]Maximizing Electoral Competition for IncumbentsJustice Kennedy argues that limits on contributions and independent politicalspending is an “incumbency protection plan.”27 [Notes.html#C11F27] Hiscontention is that such limits suppress well-funded challengers. Columnists suchas George Will agree, writing that limits rather cunningly “will be set byincumbent legislators . . . [to] serve incumbent interests.” George Will iscorrect; the limit favored by incumbents is infinity. And Justice Scalia arguedthat, “If incumbents and challengers are limited to the same quantity ofelectioneering, incumbents are favored. In other words, any restrictions upon atype of campaign speech . . . tend to favor incumbents.”28 [Notes.html#C11F28]These contentions by Kennedy, Will, and Scalia assume a fanciful vision of everychallenger as a multimillionaire of pure heart willing to bury larcenousincumbents with dollars. That stylized and vanishingly rare scenario is beliedby facts. A domain of unlimited donations enhances the electoral prospects ofincumbents. In virtually all elections, incumbents easily outraise and outspendopponents. They spend their careers pandering to donors, as the income biasdocuments, making them nearly invulnerable at the ballot box (read on). TheBuckley genre is the real incumbency protection plan.Evidence shows that making incumbents vulnerable requires corralling theirmonetary advantage by limiting electioneering spending, capping contributions,and capping independent political spending, while nurturing challengers withpublic funding. When limits are imposed in a fashion that equalizeselectioneering resources, political competition is enhanced. Politicalscientists Kenneth Mayer, Timothy Werner, and Amanda Williams concluded in aBrookings Paper, for instance, that “The fear that spending limits would putchallengers in an impossible strategic situation and make incumbents even moreunbeatable has simply not been realized.”29 [Notes.html#C11F29] Other scholarlyanalyses reached the same conclusion; Harvard-Enching Institute scholar KihongEom and political scientist Donald Gross determined that donation caps reducethe advantage of incumbency: “If anything, contribution limits can work toreduce the bias that traditionally works in favor of incumbents.”30[Notes.html#C11F30]A February 2013 analysis by George Washington University political scienceprofessor John Sides and Public Policy Institute of California research fellowEric McGhee examined the 2012 election cycle and concluded that incumbencyprovides about a five percentage points electoral edge.31 [Notes.html#C11F31]That advantage includes name recognition and at least a two-year head start inraising donations, which is why Buckley has resulted in the typicalCongressional incumbent outspending opponents by almost four to one.Consequently, more than 90 percent of Congress members are routinely reelected,including 97 percent of those seeking reelection in 2016.32 [Notes.html#C11F32]Elections are even less competitive at the state level where 93 percent ofincumbents typically win reelection. In a sentiment uniformly expressed bypolitical scientists, University of Illinois professor Michael Miller notesthat, “A career as an American legislator comes with a great deal of jobsecurity . . . Incumbents are practically unassailable . . . Most of the time,incumbents are able to bury challengers in campaign cash.”33 [Notes.html#C11F33]The necessary factors to reduce this incumbency advantage are to limitcontributions and independent political spending and equalize electioneeringresources to all candidates. These are common practices in higher qualitydemocracies to ensure competitive elections by roughly equalizing resources toall candidates, as we learned in the previous chapter. Yet equalizing resourcesto ensure competitive elections are vigorously rejected by the RobertsRepublicans. During oral argument on Arizona Free Enterprise Club PAC v. Bennett(2011), for instance, Chief Justice Roberts asserted: “Well, I checked theCitizens’ Clean Election commission website this morning and it says that thisact was passed to, quote, ‘level the playing field’ when it comes to running foroffice. Why isn’t that clear evidence that it’s unconstitutional?”34[Notes.html#C11F34]Evidence that political spending limits reduce the edge associated withincumbency comes from Arizona and Maine, states with the most seasoned publiccampaign funding programs in the United States. An analysis of these programs bypolitical science professors Seth Masket and Michael Miller in 2014 concludedthat limits combined with public funding “appear to ‘manufacture’ qualitycandidates who might otherwise lack the attributes or experience to run viablecampaigns.”35 [Notes.html#C11F35]Documentation is also provided in a subsequent analysis by Miller in his bookSubsidizing Democracy. Miller drew on more than twenty years of data and surveysfrom more than one thousand candidates in states that limit electioneeringspending while providing public funding to challengers. That combination createsmore robust competition. In Arizona, for instance, the share of incumbentsforced to confront major party challengers rose from 68 percent before publicfunding to 85 percent afterward. It improved the quality of that competition aswell. Nearly 60 percent of candidates in public funding campaigns believed theywere consequently more competitive; Miller writes they “cited public funding asvaulting them to a level of competitiveness that they would not have been ableto achieve otherwise.” The improvement in competitiveness is also suggested by adecline in electoral winning margins.36 [Notes.html#C11F36]The most expansive database bearing on the question of incumbency protection,political spending, and competition is from Albuquerque. Strict limits ondonations and on electioneering spending existed there for several decades inmunicipal races—from 1974 until terminated by lawsuits based on Buckley in themid-1990s. Its system also utilized public funding to equalize electioneeringresources for candidates during these decades, providing a data-rich base. Thefirst lawsuit challenging the Albuquerque donation limits induced acomprehensive assessment that has since been parsed by Richard Hasen. He notedthat “The court made a number of factual findings suggesting robust campaigningand widespread satisfaction with the system of candidate spending limits.” Thatsatisfaction certainly did not include incumbent mayors. The city’s combinationof public funding with caps on both donations and electioneering spending provedto be an existential threat to them—none was able to win reelection in these twodecades. Hasen explained:In contrast to the nationwide incumbency rate of 88 percent for mayors,Albuquerque had a zero percent incumbency rate in city mayoral elections heldunder spending limits. Many candidates spent less than the spending limits, andthe 1997 winner spent less than $44,000 on his campaign . . . Candidatecampaigns were vigorous and contested; incumbents did not benefit and perhapsmay have been hurt by spending limits; voter turnout was higher than in othercities; and the public approved of the programs.37 [Notes.html#C11F37]The analysis also concluded that spending limits did not constitute censorship,with Hasen noting, “the trial court’s findings do not show significantgovernment suppression of speech.”Public surveys became another element of the Albuquerque record when provided ina separate federal district court lawsuit filing. The share of local respondentswho believed that federal elections featuring unlimited political spendingfavored “special interest money” was well more than double the share believingthat Albuquerque elections featuring limits favored such interests. The federaldistrict court in Homans v. City of Albuquerque (2001) concluded that: “57percent of surveyed Albuquerque voters think that federal elections are overlyinfluenced by special interest money. In contrast, only 23 percent think thatAlbuquerque elections are overly influenced by special interest money.”38[Notes.html#C11F38]You have just read how best to begin restoring the faith of Americans in theirdemocracy.Most Americans Support Recriminalizing Vote BuyingA Pew Research Center survey in 2015 found that 76 percent of Americans believe“government is run by big interests” with only 19 percent believing that it isrun for the benefit of everyone.39 [Notes.html#C11F39] A Bloomberg survey inSeptember 2015 found 87 percent of respondents agreed that the campaign finance“system should be reformed so that a rich person does not have more influencethan a person without money.”40 [Notes.html#C11F40] Results are similar in thejoint New York Times/CBS News survey released in June 2015, noted in chapter 2[Chapter02.html]. Some 84 percent of respondents—including 80 percent ofself-described Republicans, 84 percent of independents, and 90 percent ofDemocrats—believe “money has too much influence in American politics.”41[Notes.html#C11F41] Respondents were critical of the Roberts Supreme Court, morethan half rejecting any constitutional basis for the Buckley genre. Nearly 80percent of them agreed that contributions and independent political spendingshould be capped (chart 11.1). Overall, a remarkable 85 percent of respondentsbelieved the pay-to-play US political system requires “fundamental changes,”including 46 percent who agreed that it should be abandoned entirely: “thesystem for funding political campaigns has so much wrong with it that we mustcompletely rebuild it.”42 [Notes.html#C11F42][images/pg159.jpg]Chart 11.1 Americans believe that . . .New York Times/CBS News poll, May 28–31, 2015,www.scribd.com/doc/267409090/cbs-news-new-york-times-money-and-politics-poll[http://www.scribd.com/doc/267409090/cbs-news-new-york-times-money-and-politics-poll];www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/06/01/us/politics/document-poll-may-28-31.html[http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/06/01/us/politics/document-poll-may-28-31.html]Americans’ preference to extinguish pay-to-play extends to corporatecontributions and their political/issue advertising as well. Supermajorities ofAmericans today would agree with President Theodore Roosevelt, writing in 1907,that “All contributions by corporations . . . for any political purpose shouldbe forbidden by law; directors should not be permitted to use shareholders’money for such purposes . . .”43 [Notes.html#C11F43] Even business sectorrespondents agree. The polling in Demos reported by Liz Kennedy noted in chapter8 [Chapter08.html] concluded that some 70 percent of business-sector respondentsto the 2012 Corporate Reform Coalition survey “[b]elieve a ban on corporatefunded political ads would improve politics. And a majority was in favor of aconstitutional amendment to ban all corporate contributions and political/issueadvertising.” Those majorities include 57 percent of self-described “moderates”and also 57 percent of “independents.”44 [Notes.html#C11F44] If Citizens Unitedcannot be overturned, respondents favored requiring full transparency, withcorporate donor names released immediately. And corporate and CEO donor namesshould be prominently displayed in all advertising.The widespread dismay with Citizens United is bipartisan, indicated by citizensin relatively conservative Montana and the swing state of Colorado. Montanans in2012 approved Initiative 166, which requires its Congressional delegation tosponsor a constitutional amendment to prohibit corporate donations or spendingin state elections. And some 74 percent of voters in Colorado in 2012 alsosupported a referendum calling for a US constitutional amendment to reverseCitizens United. The referendum won in every Colorado County.45[Notes.html#C11F45]Americans largely reject vote buying. Their knowledge that it remains widespreadis certainly one of the primary factors responsible for their sense of politicalimpotence and loss of faith in the nation’s governance.

Voters are neither equal nor sovereign. The remedy is to recriminalizevote buying with limits on both donations and independent political spending.Following the example of other wealthy democracies, limits are also warranted onissue advocacy during election periods. Caps or bans in other wealthydemocracies strengthen political competition, political equality, and votersovereignty while eliminating most negative appeals. Their candidates, asexemplified by German chancellor Angela Merkel, are eager to co-opt popularpolicy positions from any source—thereby edging politics to the center.Washington Post columnist Ruth Marcus explains: “In Merkel’s Germany, it hasresulted in a race to the middle—not just in forming a coalition government butin the campaign itself.”4 [Notes.html#C12F04]The most compelling lawyerly rationale in America for recriminalizing campaigndonations and independent political spending is to honor original intent, asdiscussed in the previous chapter. Definitional precision is paramount, and whena future Supreme Court seeks to end the Buckley era, it should recall whatJustice Sandra Day O’Connor concluded in McConnell v. FEC (2003). Defining andidentifying corruption is so fraught, she wrote, that “[t]he best means ofprevention is to identify and to remove the temptation.”5 [Notes.html#C12F05]The O’Connor maxim—a sweeping, encompassing definition “to remove thetemptation”—translates to an electoral system that permits only de minimiscampaign donations and does not permit expansive political/issue advertising ordonations by nominal or genuinely independent entities. Any weaker standardinvites inventive evasion. Drawing on experience in Denmark, France, Latvia, andLithuania, for instance, the UK Committee on Standards in Public Life noted in2011 that vote buyers stridently endeavor to bypass limits using loans, bydivvying-up donations among family members and trusted colleagues, by funnelinggifts through nominally independent entities, and by creating new politicalparties.6 [Notes.html#C12F06]The O’Connor maxim would provide a clarity that’s common in other wealthynations as noted by Professor Andrea Römmele of Berlin’s Hertie School ofGovernment: “In Germany, giving money in politics is always seen as trying tobuy access.”7 [Notes.html#C12F07]Within an overarching commitment to recriminalize vote buying, America can raisethe quality of its democracy with the following agenda of rules, procedures, andpractices drawn from superior democracies.Limit Electioneering SpendingElectioneering spending caps are imposed abroad to preclude a significant rolefor private capital in any guise in political campaigns. In Canada, as notedearlier, electioneering outlays by major parties at the federal level werecapped in 2015 at about $43 million apiece in a nation of 26 million registeredvoters. There and elsewhere, limits are typically imposed on a per registeredvoter basis, and vary with the scope of office sought. A common companioncomponent is prohibitions or limits on broadcast advertising, with the bulk ofelectioneering spending devoted to inexpensive marketing options likebillboards, get-out-the-vote, and more recently social media messaging.Limits on electioneering spending are closely monitored, audited, and rigorouslyenforced. For instance, the senior French court, the Constitutional Council,concluded in July 2013 that the party of presidential candidate Nicolas Sarkozyhad overspent during his 2012 election contest. His overspending totaled amodest €460,000 ($500,000), but the penalty was huge—a fine of €10 million ($11million). The penalty was more than one-third of the legally allowed overallparty spending (including a binary runoff) in 2012, reported Financial Timesjournalist Hugh Carnegy.8 [Notes.html#C12F08] The French paper Le Figarospeculated that the penalty would be “financially asphyxiating” for Sarkozy’scenter-right UMP party for several years to come.9 [Notes.html#C12F09] Exactly.Ensuring that all qualified candidates have adequate electioneering resources tochallenge incumbents is a key means of ensuring competitive elections. As in theUS, debates in other wealthy democracies are vibrant. The pool of candidates isquite diverse, representing a broad range of domestic opinion. Elections arevigorously challenged, with new issues and new candidates readily emerging.Limits on spending do not quell candidate communications or voter choice. Quitethe contrary, limits require a focus of scarce political communicationsopportunities on building candidate and party brand, while clarifying policydifferences.Higher quality democracies typically provide some level of public subsidy forcandidates in order to maximize political competition. Public fundingaccompanied by a cap on electioneering outlays ensures a high degree of citizenconfidence in the outcome, a characteristic of what Robert Post termed electoralintegrity. That does not mean equality of electioneering resources to eachcandidate, by the way. Instead, other wealthy democracies like Canada typicallyadopt systems that de facto or de jure link the actual amount of electioneeringspending beneath the official ceiling to the robustness of public support asmeasured by the number of small donations garnered.Limits on electioneering spending eliminate negative political advertising.Comprehensive transparency and content attribution rules in other wealthydemocracies mean negative political messaging cannot be conducted anonymously.Candidates and parties risk voter blowback from attack ads. By contrast,negative advertising is common in the United States in good part becausesponsorship can be veiled, absolving political parties of accountability,especially on social media.Americans have their own considerable, satisfactory experience with limits onelectioneering spending. They are a central element of public campaign fundingprograms in a number of localities, such as Maine and New York City. Thespending caps in New York City’s Campaign Finance Act (CFA) enacted in 1988 are$168,000 for city council candidates and $6,426,000 for mayoral aspirants.Similar caps exist for primary elections as well. As in every other publiccampaign funding program in America, participation by candidates must bevoluntary under prevailing Buckley era court rulings.Tight electioneering spending limits would be popular with Americans. Some 77percent of respondents in a Pew Research Center survey in late 2015 believedthere “should be limits on the amount of money individuals and organizations canspend on political campaigns and issues.” Only 20 percent believed thatorganizations or individuals should be able to donate or spend without limit.And the sentiment was bipartisan, with 72 percent of Republicans and 84 percentof Democrats agreeing on limits.10 [Notes.html#C12F10]Limit Donations to Candidates and PartiesMany higher quality democracies that limit electioneering spending such asBelgium, Canada, France, and Japan also choose to cap donations at modestlevels. American communities that adopt public campaign funding programs havefollowed suit. Individual donations to New York City politicians participatingin its CFA program, for instance, are capped at $2,750 for city council contestsand $4,950 for mayoral races.11 [Notes.html#C12F11]In New York as well as in peer nations, capping contributions to encouragenumerous small-dollar donations serves two purposes. First, in the formativestages of an election cycle, the robustness of small donations is utilized togauge community support for candidates, and thus eligibility to receive publicsubsidies. Requiring a show of small donor support is a practical market-test ofaspirants while winnowing marginal, ideologically extreme, or noveltycandidates. To appear on ballots, aspirants typically must raise a threshold,modest amount from a predetermined number of donors. City Council aspirantsunder the CFA program, for instance, must garner contributions totaling at least$5,000 from at least seventy-five donors to qualify for the ballot.12[Notes.html#C12F12] And gubernatorial candidates participating in Maine’s publiccampaign financing system must receive threshold donations from at least 3,200voters.13 [Notes.html#C12F13]Second, an emphasis on small donations appears to incentivize engagement incivic affairs and politics. When large donors were sidelined by Albuquerque’sinnovative program of limited donations in the 1970s, citizen participation incivic affairs rose. Analyses of the CFA by the Brennan Center and by politicalscientists Michael Malbin, Peter Brusoe, and Brendan Glavin in 2012 foundsimilar results. They concluded that permitting only small donations forcescandidates to solicit an entirely novel and vastly more representative set ofdonors.14 [Notes.html#C12F14]Most other wealthy democracies consider small donations so important tocompetitive elections that they subsidize them with tax credits and by offeringmatching funds. In Canada, contributors receive a 75 percent tax credit for thefirst C$400 of a political donation, the credit diminishing at higher amounts.And under CFA, any donation up to $175 is matched 6:1 from public coffers,making a small donation of that amount actually worth $1,225 to the recipientcandidate.15 [Notes.html#C12F15]There have been campaign spending reform proposals introduced in Congress thatfeature such incentives as well. The Fair Elections Now Act, for instance, firstintroduced in 2009, caps political contributions but encourages small donationswith a 5:1 match for the first $100 of donations.”16 [Notes.html#C12F16] Morerecently, the Government by the People Act sponsored by Congressman JohnSarbanes provides both a tax credit ($25) and a 6:1 match to encourage smalldonations.17 [Notes.html#C12F17]Limit Independent Political SpendingIn 2012, California public health advocates placed a referendum on ballots in ElMonte and Richmond to impose a tax on sugary drinks in an effort to reduceconsumption, a proven technique to reduce demand. As is sometimes the case inreferendums like this, voters were subjected to a barrage of issue advocacyadvertising by affected enterprises. Opponents commanded far more resources: the$114,000 mustered by health advocates was swamped by $4 million spent onbroadcast and cable TV ads, canvassing teams, phone banks, billboards, publicrallies, and the like by the sugar industry. Each antitax vote actually cast onElection Day cost the sugar advocates $115, but it was money well spent. The taxwas defeated.18 [Notes.html#C12F18] Indeed, American commercial interests ofevery stripe in recent decades have refined a sophisticated expertise to swayvoters on policy issues with lavish independent expenditures.To reduce the risk of such manipulation, higher quality democracies limit or bandonations and political issue advocacy by independent interests for some monthspreceding elections. Many utilize a definition of such spending similar to thatadopted by Elections Canada, as noted in chapter 10 [Chapter10.html].19[Notes.html#C12F19] And if adopted in the United States, that definition shouldalso feature the quaint standard proposed by Senator Barry Goldwater in TheConscience of a Conservative in 1960.20 [Notes.html#C12F20] Advocates sponsoringpolitical appeals must be able to breathe.Recall that in Canada, nationwide political advertising and issue advocacy byindependent entities during the federal election period is capped at $155,000(proportionately higher for campaigns longer than thirty-seven days). Donorsmust be identified in all advertising. In Britain, the limits are also modest,as noted by journalist Jacob Rowbottom writing in the New Republic: “Independentorganizations can spend no more than £988,000 ($1,250,000) in support of apolitical party in the UK in the 12 months before a general election and no morethan £500 ($625) in support of an individual candidate in the month before anelection. As it happens, in the 2010 UK election, very few independentorganizations came close to spending anything near the national limit.”21[Notes.html#C12F21]The UK approach is a good model for America. Independent political spending andissue advocacy are limited during the year preceding elections. Yet publicdebate is vibrant, as judged by international speech advocates such as FreedomHouse. Accepting Goldwater’s proposal, independent spending should only bepermitted by human beings. As in Canada, any cash from individuals choosing tosupport independent efforts should be deducted from an overall nationalindividual donation and spending cap.In such an election structure, there would be no scope for social-welfare501(c)(3), 501(c)(4) advocacy organizations, PACs, or super PACs, includinggroups such as Americans for Prosperity. Nor would there be room for specialpurpose slush funds created by politicians for non-election purposes, such asthe entities created to deflect accountability for the Flint water contaminationfrom Governor Rick Snyder.22 [Notes.html#C12F22] The logic for limits onindependent entities was explained by the Canadian Supreme Court, as notedearlier. And here is an explanation by Simon Fraser University politicalscientist Andrew Heard: “There are two main justifications for the third-partylimits. The first is to protect the spending limits on political parties andcandidates; otherwise, parallel campaigns could be conducted by groups allied toparticular parties. The other is to protect individual candidates from beingtargeted by expensive ad campaigns to which they could not respond because ofboth their own limited funds or the spending limits imposed on candidates.”23[Notes.html#C12F23]Adopting the UK structure would still leave considerable leeway fororganizations to opine, particularly outside the year-long election window.Entities could continue traditional branding advertising. Moreover, lobbyingactivities would continue. Finally, many corporate leaders are viewed asgenerators of wealth and employment, guaranteeing that their voices would beheard and heeded by lawmakers and their constituents. Indeed, scholars havedocumented that their influence can sway public opinion even in the absence ofpay-to-play. Duke business professor Aaron Chatterji and Harvard professorMichael Toffel in 2016 assessed the ability of CEOs to influence public opinion.They chose a controversial social issue for their project—whether Indiana statelaw should permit discrimination against homosexuals. As a precursor to theirexperiment, about half of their 3,400 respondents were told that Apple CEOTimothy Cook, the CEO of Indiana-based Angie’s List, William Oesterle, and themayor of Indianapolis opposed any law that permitted discrimination: “We foundthat public support for the law declined sharply, and roughly equally, ifrespondents were informed that Mr. Cook, Mr. Oesterle, or the mayor ofIndianapolis were concerned about it . . . Prominent chief executives . . . canshape public opinion about controversial social issues.”24 [Notes.html#C12F24]Voter equality is maximized by election systems abroad because of effective andtimely monitoring of donors and of electioneering spending, which facilitatesthe prosecution of political corruption. Independent third parties are alsoclosely monitored abroad and must register immediately upon establishment. Arevamped, expanded, independent Federal Election Commission or any successor inthe United States ideally should be able to track outlays and to obtain thenames and amounts of individual donations and of spending on a real-time basis.Both Elections Canada and the California’s Fair Political Practices Commissionprovide useful models. Regulators in the latter were responsible for peelingaway four layers of obfuscating 501(c)4 cutouts in 2012, for instance, todiscover that the Koch brothers, Sheldon Adelson, and Charles Schwab were behindan $11 million campaign of attack ads to kill Proposition 30 in that state. Theproposition—raising state income taxes on higher incomes to fund a $6 billionincrease in education spending—was approved by voters nonetheless.25[Notes.html#C12F25] A useful reform was instituted in reaction to this exposé:California in 2014 enacted a law requiring groups with political spending of$50,000 or more in one year (or $100,000 within four years) to reveal everydonor of more than $1,000.26 [Notes.html#C12F26]An additional monitoring tactic is the use of undercover investigations byauthorities to ferret out corrupt public officials. Such stings have beenutilized to snare corrupt American and European parliamentarians.27[Notes.html#C12F27] For instance, over one hundred (of 480) Romanian legislatorsresponded to a fake bribe attempt by sham firms in the United Arab Emirates in asting engineered by the daily Romania Libera.28 [Notes.html#C12F28]Finally, monitoring systems need to be dynamic in order to keep pace withadvances in voter-influencing technology. The fittest fifty mostly fundtraditional political techniques—advertising, grass roots mobilization, and thelike—that should be subject to reports and auditing. But pioneers such asbillionaire Robert Mercer are marrying big data from social media to targetvoters utilizing psychological warfare techniques derived from the military.It’s called psychometrics and targets individual voters in gargantuan numbersmore effectively than traditional media.29 [Notes.html#C12F29] Mercer has spentat least $15 million refining such tools using social data analytics to pinpointindividual swing or “persuadable” voters.30 [Notes.html#C12F30] A test run inearly 2016 targeted 600,000 identified persuadables in Britain who were soondeluged with pro-Brexit information. Similar influencer programs were likelyconducted by the Koch data mining firm i360 and the Trump campaign (incollaboration with Mercer’s Cambridge Analytica) using ad buy on Twitter andFacebook during 2016. Such psychographic practices manipulate rather thanpersuade voters. Their use for political purposes should be prohibited, whetherconducted by Russians or Americans.Limit Length of CampaignsOther wealthy democracies limit the period for campaigns and so should theUnited States. Campaign seasons are set by law or in some instances as in Canadaby common practice. The longest are nearly five months (139 days) in the UnitedKingdom and Mexico (147 days), but are shorter elsewhere.31 [Notes.html#C12F31]Compare that to the 2016 US election cycle, which began well before the firstprimaries on February 1, 2016. A relatively short campaign season would bewelcomed by Americans. In most if not all other wealthy democracies,electioneering spending by candidates and political parties are prohibitedexcept during the campaign season. Limits on third-party political spending andissue advocacy are imposed for even longer periods preceding Election Day,including the noted UK caps on independent political spending and politicalissue advocacy applicable for the year concluding on Election Day.32[Notes.html#C12F32]Limit Political and Issue Advertising in Broadcast and Other MediaPeer nations have concluded that limits on broadcast advertising are animportant element to controlling electioneering spending and ensuring that afactual, informative political discourse occurs between candidates, parties, andvoters. Paid political advertisements on TV (but not on social media) are bannedin Belgium, Britain, Brazil, France, Ireland, Japan, and others, although someairtime is variously provided free.33 [Notes.html#C12F33] In France, forinstance, six hours of air time is provided gratis, split among all presidentialcandidates equally. In Canada, some 214 minutes of political air time isprovided free on public television split between parties. And privatebroadcasters must make available for sale at relatively low rates an additional6.5 hours split between parties.34 [Notes.html#C12F34] (Political parties canpurchase this additional airtime as long as they remain beneath their overallnationwide electioneering spending cap.) Advertising on American TV stations isprohibited.35 [Notes.html#C12F35] Political parties in Germany are given modestairtime on public networks and can purchase a bit more on private networks. Butas noted earlier, spending limits nonetheless held the number of times politicalads by Chancellor Merkel were aired in 2013 to 140 in total. In addition, TVadvertising by independent entities or associations, if permitted at all, iscapped at quite low levels during the campaign season everywhere.36[Notes.html#C12F36]American political advertising should be limited, with airtime ideally providedgratis and in equal portions on public television and by broadcasters enjoyinguse of the public airways. Such spending caps would doubtless be welcomed byviewers. The Wesleyan Media Project determined that 1.35 million ads were airedduring the 2014 midterm elections in the United States.37 [Notes.html#C12F37] Ifeach was thirty seconds in duration, that translates to 11,000 hours ofpolitical advertising—vastly more than permitted in peer nations.A major benefit of capping broadcast airtime abroad is a flight to positivecampaigning by candidates and parties. That characteristic is magnified furtherif anonymity is stripped away, with actual donors identified in all independentpolitical spending. And regulations abroad are sufficiently robust that publicmonitors reject outright fabrications, analogous to the US Swift Boat adsregarding John Kerry in 2004, or ads during the 2012 Republican primary in SouthCarolina alleging that Mitt Romney was a serial killer.38 [Notes.html#C12F38]Political speech on social media is discussed in Chapter 15 [Chapter15.html].Mandate Public Funding of ElectionsIn crafting a replacement for pay-to-play in financing elections, Americancourts or lawmakers can draw on the rich and successful domestic history ofpublicly funded elections, time-tested at every level of US politics. Theconcept was first introduced by Theodore Roosevelt in the wake of the 1907financial panic to weaken the political influence of the fittest fifty of hisday. But implementation was fitful until the Watergate scandal in 1974. Thefirst nationwide American public funding mechanism was adopted as one element ofthe new campaign finance reforms enacted then by Congress. The law mandated thatpresidential candidates utilize only public funding for campaigns; that mandatewas removed two years later in the Buckley ruling, leaving participationvoluntary ever since. Even so, public funding comprised the bulk of presidentialcampaign spending until 1996, when surpassed by independent expenditures and PACspending.39 [Notes.html#C12F39] All major party presidential candidates utilizedpublic funding until 2008 when President Obama opted to fund his campaignentirely with private donations.Albuquerque adopted public funding in 1974, with other adventuresome states andlocalities following, supported by advocates from both political parties. Thepolitical benefits have also been bipartisan. For example, the election ofgrassroots conservatives in Arizona who later emerged as the foundation of theTea Party was enabled by that state’s public financing program. And earlier,Ronald Reagan became president thanks to public campaign financing. ChallengingPresident Gerald Ford for the GOP nomination in 1976, Reagan ran out of moneyduring the primaries.40 [Notes.html#C12F40] Accepting taxpayer funds from thenewly established presidential public financing program enabled him to campaignexpansively in primary states in 1976. His charisma and impressive politicalskills emerged and were powerful elements in his success four years later.Despite this history, contemporary conservatives seem unhappily surprised by thepopularity of public campaign funding, with Washington Post neoconservativeDavid Ignatius writing, “the public funding idea isn’t as unpopular as you mightthink.”41 [Notes.html#C12F41] In fact, grassroots staunch conservatives find itattractive as one step toward shrinking the influence of political elites. Thepublic funding program in Tallahassee installed by 67 percent of referendumvoters in 2014, for instance, was a joint effort of the local Tea Party andprogressive grassroots.42 [Notes.html#C12F42]Surveys confirm the broad base of support for public campaign financing. Forexample, some 74 percent of respondents to the Corporate Reform Coalition surveyin 2012 noted in chapter 5 [Chapter05.html] favor a campaign finance systemfeaturing small-dollar private donations supplemented with public funding. Some72 percent believed that “politics would improve with public funding ofCongressional campaigns instead of special interest spending.”43[Notes.html#C12F43] Support for public funding also emerged in a detailed surveyof reform ideas in 2009, conducted by political scientists at the University ofTexas. On a scale of 1 (no support) to 10 (strongly support), support wasstrongest for reforms that provided free and equal TV airtime to candidates(mean score 7.23), that strengthened the Federal Election Commission (6.69),that shortened campaigns to four weeks (6.00), and that replaced all privatepolitical contributions with public funding (5.83).44 [Notes.html#C12F44]Mandate Public Funding of Judicial ElectionsHefty majorities of Americans also prefer eliminating contributions andindependent political/issue advertising in judicial elections. And judgesthemselves have long agreed. Surveys by the nonpartisan National Center forState Courts beginning in 2001 found public funding of such elections werefavored by 53 percent of judges surveyed in California (2001), 56 percent inFlorida (2001), 69 percent in Illinois (2001), 74 percent in New York (2001), 60percent (of voters) in Idaho (2002), and 65 percent (of voters) in Wisconsin(2008).45 [Notes.html#C12F45] The legal profession also supports public funding,exemplified by this declaration by an American Bar Association commission in2002: “The Commission unanimously recommends that states that elect judges incontested elections finance judicial elections with public funds . . . TheCommission concludes that public financing of judicial elections will addressthe perceived impropriety associated with judicial candidates accepting privatecontributions from individuals and organizations interested in the outcomes ofcases those candidates may later decide as judges.”46 [Notes.html#C12F46]In addition, recall that Geri Palast evaluated survey data garnered anonymouslyfrom 2,428 judges serving on state supreme courts, appellate courts, and lowercourts on behalf of Justice at Stake. Most respondents were subject to election,and thus had firsthand experience with the range of pathologies in state courtsinduced by pay-to-play. The survey revealed considerable angst regarding theinfluence of money, with 71 percent of the judges believing that campaigndonations to judicial candidates should be limited. Some 61 percent supported apublicly financed campaign system for judicial elections. In the interim, untilsuch reforms occur, a majority of respondents (56 percent) agreed that judgesshould recuse from cases involving campaign contributors; as noted earlier, thatis an impractical solution.47 [Notes.html#C12F47]American Experience with Public FundingThe broad appeal of programs for public funding of political or judicialcampaigns is responsible for their spread in various forms to some twenty-fivestates since the 1970s, including thirteen statewide programs in variousformulations.48 [Notes.html#C12F48] Aside from New York City (established in1988), the most expansive are elaborate statewide programs in Maine (1996),Arizona (1998), and Connecticut (2005). These are “clean election” programswhere full funding for campaigns is provided once a candidate qualifies byraising numerous small donations. Ten other states provide campaign funding tomatch small donations. A few states like Maryland provide public funding just togubernatorial and judicial candidates. Public funding programs have also beenadopted in various forms by a host of localities beyond Albuquerque and New YorkCity, including Chapel Hill, North Carolina, Long Beach, Los Angeles, Santa Fe,San Francisco, Seattle, and most recently in Chicago, Howard and MontgomeryCounties in Maryland, and Tallahassee. California in 2016 lifted itstwenty-nine-year-old ban that will enable public financing to be broadly adoptedbeyond the few current city programs. In contrast, programs have been pared backor dropped in recent years in Wisconsin and North Carolina (the repeal by NorthCarolina Republicans included terminating the public funding of judicialelections also). Public funding is popular with Americans. When the decision isleft to voters rather than politicians, public funding generally is approved.For instance, voters in Maine in 2015 rejected GOP efforts to end the stateprogram, instead voting to considerably expand funding.Under Buckley era rulings, participation by aspirants in these programs must bevoluntary; candidates are given the option to participate by accepting somepublic funding or to opt out and rely instead on private contributions. Allprograms require participating candidates (but not those opting out) to acceptelectioneering spending limits. It is also common for candidates to be requiredto qualify for public support by raising a sizable number of small donations, asalready noted. Participants are usually required to engage in debates withrivals; in Seattle, for instance, the minimum is three debates. Program revenuesare typically derived from civil and other fines such as speeding tickets orfrom general revenue. Seattle voters in November 2015 approved an innovative anduser-friendly public campaign financing program that began in 2017. Financed bya token increase in local real estate taxes (i.e., $9), each registered voterreceives four $25 “democracy vouchers” during each election cycle to donate toas many as four candidates in city elections.49 [Notes.html#C12F49] Expandingthat program statewide, however, was rejected by voters in 2016.Public funding programs succeed in drawing participation from well more thanone-half of all candidates. Some 74 percent of winning Maine state senatecandidates in 2016 were clean election candidates, for instance; overall, 64percent of winning state legislators in 2016 were clean election candidates, upfrom 58 percent in the previous legislature.50 [Notes.html#C12F50] InConnecticut in 2014, both gubernatorial candidates participated, as did all sixwinning candidates for statewide office and 83.4 percent of winning statelegislators.51 [Notes.html#C12F51] And some 196 candidates of both partiesparticipated in 2016, receiving a total of $8 million. To receive $95,710,senate candidates had to qualify by raising $15,000 from at least 300constituents. House candidates received $28,150 upon raising $5,000 from atleast 150 district residents.52 [Notes.html#C12F52] The outcome has been a morediverse group of competitive candidates and legislators, including more womenand members of minority groups. For instance, 89 percent (51 out of 57) of thewomen elected in Connecticut in 2014 were public funding candidates.53[Notes.html#C12F53]As University of Illinois professor Michael Miller noted in a detailed 2014analysis, when publicly funded candidates are freed of most fundraising chores,they spend more time interacting with voters and refining electoral skills thando traditionally funded candidates.54 [Notes.html#C12F54] Consequently,incumbents face more and higher quality competitors.55 [Notes.html#C12F55]Recall that no mayoral incumbents were reelected during the two decades ofpublic campaign funding in Albuquerque. A study by Kenneth R. Mayer, TimothyWerner, and Amanda Williams summarized the academic perspective on such programsthis way:Public funding programs increase the pool of candidates willing and able to runfor state legislative office. This effect is most pronounced for challengers,who were far more likely than incumbents to accept public funding. Publicfunding increases the likelihood that an incumbent will have a competitive race. . . public funding has not made incumbents safer. Fears that public fundingwould amount to an incumbency protection act are unfounded . . . In the end, weconclude that public funding programs—particularly the full “clean elections”systems in Arizona and Maine—increase the competitiveness of state legislativeelections.56 [Notes.html#C12F56]Public funding also focuses candidates on middle-class concerns as explained byGeorge Leventhal, a local elected official in Montgomery County, Maryland: “Whenyou are looking for campaign support in chunks of $1,000 or more, you spend alot of time with millionaires. What I’m finding now is that to get to $500[donor threshold], I’ve spent most of my time with ordinary working people.”57[Notes.html#C12F57]Public campaign funding programs in this country and others have successfullyrelied on small donors to provide adequate resources for more competitiveelections. They have also proven that small donors combined with some publicfunding can replace large donors in sufficiently financing electoral systems.The most comprehensive analysis of small donors is by Public Campaign, anadvocacy group supporting public funding of campaigns. It found that smalldonors of $200 or less gave a total of $1 billion during the 2014 electioncycle.58 [Notes.html#C12F58] Real-world experience in Canada, Britain, andnumerous American localities such as Albuquerque, Connecticut, and Maine areevidence that public campaign finance systems and spending caps ensureinformative, robust, and competitive elections—and make incumbents nervous.A Partisan Divide Created by the Fittest FiftyParticipation by candidates has been robust and bipartisan since the inceptionof public campaign funding, and remains so today: Some 78 percent of winningRepublicans in Connecticut in 2014, for instance, utilized public funding.59[Notes.html#C12F59] Indeed, Tea Party activists and state/local GOP officialswere cochairs of the successful ballot referendum in 2016 that established theSouth Dakota campaign finance voucher program featuring an independent ethicsboard and a $100 limit on lobbyists’ gifts. Opponents included the Koch brotherswho funded 95 percent of spending on the losing side. The Kochs don’t takedefeats easily, however. More anxious to please the Kochs by preservingpay-to-play than their constituents, Republican state legislators and thegovernor in South Dakota defiantly repealed the reforms on February 2, 2017.Such defiance is rare. The other recent episode was when GOP lawmakers in 2017gutted implementation of an anti-gerrymandering constitutional amendmentsupported by 63 percent of Florida voters.60 [Notes.html#C12F60]The reaction of these South Dakota politicians dramatizes the opposition amongRepublican officials (but not grassroots) to public campaign financing programs.Recall that such programs have recently been terminated by GOP state officialsin North Carolina and Wisconsin. In Congress, the GOP majority on theAdministration Committee in the House of Representatives in early 2015 voted toentirely extinguish the presidential public financing program. And the Trumpadministration may support its demise. Even so, political scientists such asMichael Miller have found empirically that public funding does not disadvantageconservatives or Republicans.61 [Notes.html#C12F61]Republican distaste for public funding appears rooted in three factors: theirsmall-government ideology, their (possible) superior ability to garner privatedonations, and their allegiance to the fittest fifty, who naturally have anextreme antipathy toward contribution limits and public funding. Thus, GOPcandidates make somewhat less use of public funding opportunities thanDemocrats. For instance, the share of Republican candidates for state houseseats in Arizona, Connecticut (2008 only), and Maine utilizing public fundingranged between 40 percent and 66 percent from 2002 to 2008. The share ofDemocrats in those states varied between 70 percent and 85 percent.62[Notes.html#C12F62]Public campaign funding advocates have also had to overcome opposition rooted inthe jurisprudence of Roberts Republicans, whose rulings have notably diminishedthe lure of such programs. In Randall v. Sorrell (2006), for example, theyrejected mandatory electioneering spending caps and donations limits imposed onparticipating candidates in state and local public campaign funding programs.And in 2011 (Arizona Free Enterprise v. Bennett and McComish v. Bennett), theyrejected provisions allowing participating candidates to receive a largeinfusion of taxpayer funds to match lavish electioneering spending by anonparticipating (privately funded) rival. Such a provision had enabled JanetNapolitano to defeat a well-funded Congressman in 2006 in Arizona, becoming thefirst governor elected with public funding.These rulings reduced participation in some public funding programs. In Maine,for instance, candidate participation in 2016 fell below its peak of 81 percentin 2008. In Arizona, the share of general election candidates participating fellby more than half (66 percent to 28 percent) between 2008 and 2014. Indeed, inthe Arizona election of 2012, eighteen legislators who had previously beenelected using public funding switched to relying solely on private donations.63[Notes.html#C12F63]These steps to roll back public funding programs by Republicans have metresistance. Unhappy voters in Maine reacted to the Arizona Free Enterpriseruling by approving a referendum in November 2015 increasing the amount of moneyavailable to publicly funded candidates. The referendum mandated otherimprovements as well and requires disclosure on political advertisements of thetop three donors to each candidate not participating in public funding. Theevents in Maine are indicative of persistently broad support for public campaignfunding programs despite the hostility of Roberts Republicans. Connecticut’sstatewide program and the CFA program in New York City are especially thriving.In 2013, New York City’s program saw a 92 percent participation rate bycandidates during the primary and 72 percent during the general election. Thenext year, participation in Connecticut was a record 84 percent of winningcandidates.64 [Notes.html#C12F64]This enthusiasm is also reflected in successful 2016 referenda designed toimprove the quality of American democracy. They included: • South Dakota voters established a program to encourage smalldonations, providing each voter $100 in vouchers to donate to eligiblecandidates in future elections.65 [Notes.html#C12F65] (This is theaforementioned program subsequently killed by GOP legislators and governor inFebruary 2017.) • Missouri voters reestablished campaign donation limits that had beenremoved in 2008 by state legislators. In the future, individual donations tocandidates are capped at $2,600 and at $25,000 to political parties. • Programs to provide a public match for small donations were approvedin Berkeley, California, and Howard County, Maryland. • Voters in California, Washington, and Wisconsin approved resolutionsto overturn the Roberts Republicans’ Citizens United ruling.Rehabilitate the Electoral SystemThe Buckley genre’s embrace of pay-to-play is responsible for the income biasidentified by Giles, Page, and other scholars. This chapter has outlined thespecific steps that higher quality democracies utilize to remediate that bias.They do more by also utilizing superior electoral systems to enhance voterequality and sovereignty. These systems provide a model for America to upgradeits own system—a system judged to be of dismal quality by international experts.The most compelling and sustentative international analysis of the quality ofelectoral systems is produced by the Election Integrity Project (EIP), a jointeffort of 2,000 political scientists and other independent observers across theglobe under the auspices of the Australian Research Council, the University ofSydney, and Harvard University. Its most recent survey analyzed 213 electionsconducted by 153 nations between 2012 and 2016.66 [Notes.html#C12F66] Expertsevaluated practices in each nation against a global standard of 49 componentsmeasuring the quality of elections—assessing how well individual politicalrights and voter preferences were safeguarded and reflected in electoraloutcomes.The EIP experts found American elections to be of poor and deteriorating qualityjudged using impartial global criteria. In two of the last five presidentialelections, for instance, also-ran aspirants were jumped over the winningcandidates—once (in 2000) by court decree: “American elections are riskyenterprises where outcomes may be determined by the legal wisdom of the courtsrather than a count of the votes cast in the ballot box . . . The evidence showsthat recent US elections display the worst performance among two-dozen Westerndemocracies . . . The evidence does not suggest that the quality of Americanelections has improved over these successive contests; if anything, problems areperceived to have worsened.”67 [Notes.html#C12F67]The nonpartisan EIP experts were particularly critical of the role played bywealthy donors and of the extraordinary ability of partisans in Congress andstate legislatures to establish and police self-serving electoral rulesgoverning their own career prospects: “Matters of electoral governance shouldnot be determined through laws enacted by self-interested partisanrepresentatives in state houses—the equivalent to putting the fox in charge ofthe chicken coop.”EIP found the quality of American elections to be so low that it ranked onlyfifty-second in electoral integrity among the 153 nations, well behind otherwealthy democracies, and also below the caliber of elections in a large numberof middle-income nations such as Croatia, Tunisia, and Brazil. Indeed, the poorquality of American elections was determined to be no better than thoseconducted by a group of other underperforming democracies including Rwanda,Barbados, Panama, and South Africa (chart 12.1). You read that correctly.[images/pg179.jpg]Chart 12.1 Mean assessment values ranged from 0 (poor) to 100 (excellent).Election Integrity Project, Pippa Norris, “Why American Elections Are Flawed(And How to Fix Them),” Faculty Research Working Paper Series 16-038, September30, 2016, https://research.hks.harvard.edu/publications/getFile.aspx?Id=1431[https://research.hks.harvard.edu/publications/getFile.aspx?Id=1431]A separate study released in January 2017 by the Economist, summarized in anepigraph to this chapter, reached similar findings, the magazine’s editorsconcluding that the United States is a “flawed democracy.” “Popular trust ingovernment, elected representatives and political parties has fallen toextremely low levels in the US . . . The US now keeps company with countriesthat include Italy, Botswana, Sri Lanka, and Mexico.”68 [Notes.html#C12F68]Other foreign experts concur. American elections are characterized by partisanvoter suppression, tens of millions of wasted votes, maladministration, and ahost of ensuing second-order malpractices. As noted by Australian professorPippa Norris, US elections are “[e]xemplified by inaccurate voter registers,partisan gerrymandering, maladministration of polling, vote-buying,clientalistic politics . . . erroneous counts, campaigns awash with money, andexcessively high legal barriers to elected office. ‘Second-order’ malpracticescan happen anywhere . . . as exemplified by the notorious hanging chads inFlorida in 2000.”69 [Notes.html#C12F69][images/star.jpg]The EIP assessment lamented the “massive influence of wealthy private donors onelectoral campaigns and programs.”70 [Notes.html#C12F70] It fingered thefollowing specific practices as responsible for the low quality of Americanelections: • Winner-take-all electoral systems and single member districts thatmisrepresent voter preferences and produce tens of millions of wasted votes(cast for losing candidates)—a phenomenon rare in wealthy democracies. Theremedy is adoption of proportional representation (PR) systems to ensure thateach voter’s preference is reflected in composition of legislatures. Conceivedin Denmark during the 1850s, PR’s leading proponents included Alexis deTocqueville in France and John Stuart Mill in England. Utilized in over twentyhigher quality democracies in Europe such as Germany, PR eliminatesgerrymandering and wasted votes. But in the United States, political partyofficials have successfully resisted efforts to install PR and have eliminatedthose established by voter referendum in cities such as Cincinnati. Today, itattracts little attention aside from advocates such as Democratic CongressmanDon Beyer and the nonpartisan advocacy organization FairVote.71[Notes.html#C12F71] (A different, narrower definition of “wasted votes” isutilized by American political scientists; it is a measure of the degree towhich partisan lawmakers create gerrymandered legislative districts that arelopsided in favor of one political party.)72 [Notes.html#C12F72] • Gerrymandering of legislative districts to favor the ruling party.The success of US political parties in cornering state governments andCongressional seats regardless of popular vote outcomes is a consequence ofgerrymandering. The dark corners of American democracy are gerrymandered,single-party legislative districts fostering lawmakers on the political fringe.Gerrymandering is only possible in the rare winner-take-all, single memberlegislative district structures like the United States, not in the PR electoralsystems nearly universal in higher quality democracies. Until PR is adopted, aninterim reform is to rely on entities independent of politicians to drawlegislative district lines. Of the forty-three states with more than one seat inCongress, eight, including California, no longer permit lawmakers themselves todesign their legislative districts. Instead, they rely on independentcommissions, most installed by citizen referenda. And one state,Democratic-leaning Maryland, has proposed that five other mid-Atlantic states(New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and North Carolina) join it inestablishing such nonpartisan commissions; the imaginative proposal was vetoedby the Republican governor in 2017. Importantly, the Supreme Court in ArizonaState Legislature v. Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission (2015) ruledsuch independent entities constitutional. Winner-take-all elections and singlemember districts cause electoral outcomes in the most gerrymandered Americanstate (North Carolina) to reflect popular choices and voter opinion no betterthan do elections in notoriously faux democracies such as Cuba, Indonesia, orSierra Leone. • Extremely low turnout for Congressional and other down-ballotoffices. Negative political advertising, indifference by legislators to popularsentiment, and the oppressive influence of wealthy donors has discouragedparticipation. Moreover, with major elections held on Tuesdays, many Americansmust leave work to vote. Low turnout is exacerbated by partisan steps limitingearly voting opportunities and reducing the availability of ballot stations instates controlled by the Republican Party, such as Ohio. • Partisan disenfranchisement through targeted voter registrationrestrictions. The EIP analysts noted that the burdensome American “voterregistration system de facto discriminates against lower classes andAfrican-Americans in particular.” Partisans should not be involved in voterregistration or balloting mechanisms. The success of American Republicanofficials in restricting registration opportunities reflects the absence of afederalized, automated national voter registration system. Restrictive practicesinclude needless voter ID requirements, limited Election Day registrationopportunities, the curtailing of registration campaigns by nonpartisan groupssuch as the League of Women Voters, and the unwarranted purge of voterregistration rolls (e.g., in Florida, North Carolina, Ohio, and Wisconsin)particularly targeting minorities. (In higher quality democracies, voter systemsregister citizens at age eighteen and autonomously update them during theirlives.) These practices have been justified by members of the Republican Partywith bogus assertions, including Trump advisor Stephen Miller who hasmendaciously asserted that “14 percent of noncitizens,” including Latinoimmigrants, are registered to vote.73 [Notes.html#C12F73] • The Electoral College and absence of a binary runoff mechanism allowselectoral losers to ascend to the presidency. America stands alone among wealthydemocracies in thwarting the majoritarian will of voters in selecting nationalleaders. Other nations select national leaders by absolute majority vote(France) or by parliamentary vote (Germany). As Swiss researcher Nils-ChristianBormann and Penn State political science professor Matt Golder explain, “The[concept of an] electoral college is currently used only in the United States,after Argentina and Finland abandoned it in the 1980s.”74 [Notes.html#C12F74]Reforms Threatened by Institutionalized Voter SuppressionThe institutionalized disenfranchisement and suppression of political opponentspinpointed by the EIP is rooted in two judicial rulings by the RobertsRepublicans. As noted in chapter 5 [Chapter05.html], Crawford empowered voter IDlaws while Shelby declared section 5 of the Voting Rights Act unconstitutional.Shelby restored the Jim Crow era doctrine of undue state sovereignty on votereligibility—federal authority subservient—belying the Fifteenth Amendment. Inthe wake of that ruling, numerous Republican state governments enacted votersuppression laws aimed at Democratic-leaning voters. Some 600,000 mostly poor orelderly whites and minorities in Texas alone who lacked required IDs werestripped of eligibility. The types of suppression highlighted by the EIP reportinclude burdensome new voter ID rules, elimination of hundreds of pollingstations in Democratic precincts, elimination of voter registration drives inhigh schools and on college campuses, purges of eligible voters fromregistration rolls, reduction in early voting opportunities, and ending ElectionDay registration. For instance, GOP election officials since 2008 in Indianahave manipulated the early voting process to expand Republican votingopportunities while shrinking Democratic ones. They tripled the number oflocations in Republican-leaning counties like Hamilton to facilitate voters withtransportation or schedule challenges while restricting Democratic-heavyIndianapolis (Marion County) to just one site. Consequently, each early votingsite serves roughly 100,000 registered voters in Hamilton but more than 700,000in Marion. The strategy was quite effective: Compared to 2008, early voting roseby 21,000 (63 percent) in Hamilton in 2016 while actually shrinking by 24,000(26 percent) in Marion. The share of all ballots cast early rose from 25 percentto 34 percent in Hamilton County, while declining to 19 percent from 24 percentin Marion County.75 [Notes.html#C12F75]Abolishing the ability of citizens to register on Election Day is a particularlyeffective vote suppression tactic. The fifteen states permitting suchregistration consistently have the nation’s highest electoral turnout rates,including the top state of Minnesota where 75 percent of eligible (registeredand unregistered) citizens cast ballots in 2016—25 percent greater than thenational average of 60 percent in presidential election cycles.76[Notes.html#C12F76]With the share of nonwhite eligible voters rising briskly nationally,institutionalized suppression has emerged as an imperative for the RepublicanParty, fully supported by the Trump administration. Its Justice Department inJanuary 2017, for instance, reversed long-standing practice by ceasing allinvestigations of alleged violations by state and local GOP officials of theVoting Rights Act. A few months later, it conjured a “Presidential AdvisoryCommission on Electoral Integrity” stacked with GOP officials experienced instripping Democratic-leaning citizens from state voter rolls. In-person voterfraud in America is essentially nonexistent—a sham. Yet the goal of theCommission is to sow doubts about that fact in order to justify the widespreaddisenfranchisement of voters who bend Democratic. The commission is chaired byKansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, whose “Crosscheck” initiative in the pasthas widely disseminated bogus registration information used to purge voters instates like Idaho and Iowa.77 [Notes.html#C12F77] For instance, it fingered240,000 Iowans in 2012 and 2014 as purge targets because they shared without-of-state voters common birthdates and (first and last) names like MariaRodriguez.78 [Notes.html#C12F78] Yet researchers at Stanford, Harvard, theUniversity of Pennsylvania, and Microsoft determined that only a minuscule sixof them had cast double ballots.79 [Notes.html#C12F79]The Trump administration has also refused to intervene in Ohio where GOPGovernor John Kasich has purged 2 million mostly young, poor, and nonwhiteoccasional voters since 2011. The purges have affected Democratic-leaningneighborhoods at roughly twice the rate of Republican-leaning neighborhoods,according to an independent analysis by Reuters.80 [Notes.html#C12F80]Looking ahead, the Trump administration, Roberts Republicans, and the GOPCongress may prohibit online voter registration, which significantly eases thechore of registration. Some thirty-one states allowed online registration in2016, a dramatic increase since 2010 when only six did.81 [Notes.html#C12F81]There are three other electoral reforms expanding voting that may also betargeted. The first could be repeal of the National Voter Registration Act, alsoknown as Motor Voter. This law facilitates voter registration for citizensinteracting with state agencies. Indeed, some ten states and the District ofColumbia have or are installing automatic registration mechanisms for suchcitizens, including Oregon. Under its first-in-the-nation law, citizensinteracting with that state’s Division of Motor Vehicles are automaticallyregistered to vote. Some 272,000 were registered in its first year. Easing theburden of registration paid off in November 2016 when participation by these newvoters caused the increase in turnout in Oregon to lead the nation.82[Notes.html#C12F82]A second target could be reforms that ensure binary runoffs occur, like theLouisiana electoral system. A variation that prevents a second election when nocandidate wins a majority initially is called ranked-choice, in use in a fewlocalities such as Takoma Park, Maryland. Residents cast votes for candidates inhierarchical order, ensuring that only candidates favored by a majority ofvoters can be elected.83 [Notes.html#C12F83]Third could be a ban on nonpartisan or open primaries. All aspirants for apolitical office in California, Washington state, and Louisiana are required tofirst compete in a single primary—the so-called “jungle” primary—regardless ofpolitical party affiliation. The two aspirants receiving the most votessubsequently compete in a binary runoff in the November general election. Thissystem has quite dramatically moderated the voting behavior of CongressionalRepublicans in California.84 [Notes.html#C12F84] They have been forced since2012 out of the dark corners of American democracy to compete in primaries notdominated by staunchly conservative party grassroots. (Importantly, Californiaalso eliminated gerrymandered legislative districts at the same time.) In 2013,for instance, the median left-right Congressional voting record of CaliforniaRepublicans shifted from the quite conservative eighty-fifth percentile amongall Members of Congress to the sixtieth percentile.85 [Notes.html#C12F85][images/star.jpg]Ending pay-to-play would ease the path for legislators to then pursue thereforms explored in this chapter. It would enable members of Congress soinclined to meet the preferences of middle-class voters rather than donors,raising the quality of American democracy, diminishing the income bias, andaffirming original intent. Another important pillar of democracy identified bythe framers was the quality of information available to voters. This originalintent, derailed by the fake news phenomenon during the 2016 presidentialelection, is examined in the following chapters."},{"pageContent":"SECTION 4 [Contents.html#SEC04][images/common.jpg]Original Intent to Prevent Fake News [Contents.html#SEC04a]THE FRAMERS DRAMATICALLY SPREAD the franchise but realized that the poorlyinformed voters of their day needed to be provided with facts and knowledge inorder to bring informed opinions into the voting booth. They were concerned withthe dangers posed by an electorate misled by “artful misrepresentations byinterested men,” or “pretend patriots.”Their concerns have resurfaced of late with one of the two major politicalparties concluding that partisan success can be found by diminishing the qualityof factual information available to voters. That is a harsh conclusion, but theRepublican Party today seeks to prosper by providing voters with fake newssupporting afactual narratives for partisan advantage. Their Orwellian newsstrategy includes delegitimizing factual journalism with persistent attacks onthe mainstream media. Both practices would leave the framers apoplectic.By institutionalizing fake news as a seminal party principle, the GOP strategyis to inveigle voters with a compelling alternative to truth. Americans havebecome more divided than at any time since the Vietnam War and perhaps since theantebellum era. Compromise has become toxic. Convinced that they are disdainedby big government elites who are indifferent to wage stagnation, and threatenedby immigrants and minorities, a sizable cohort of mostly conservative whitevoters has grown suspicious of collaboration and cooperation with Democrats.This Republican tactic centered on misinformation has reduced the politicalmiddle, diminishing the moderation and respect for opponents that are essentialfor a high-quality democracy. It has promoted a polarized society whereneighbors no longer share the same facts and view each other as fools or worse,significantly exacerbating the divide explored by Mann and Ornstein in 2012. Forexample, in the wake of 9/11 in 2001, Gallup surveys found that 74 percent ofrespondents believed the nation was united. In 2004, that sentiment stood at 45percent. But, the 2016 election drove that figure down to a bare 21 percent.1[Notes.html#S4F01] Michigan State political science professor Corwin Smidt hasdocumented a dramatic decline in the share of floating or swing voters in theAmerican electorate. They comprise only 5 percent of voters now—one-half theirshare in the early 1990s and down from a high of 15 percent in the late 1960s.2[Notes.html#S4F02]Eliminating pay-to-play is central to raising the quality of American democracy.Integral to that goal is realizing the framers’ hope by expunging fake news fromAmerican politics to elevate the factual foundation of voter decisions andrebuild a moderate center."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 13 [Contents.html#CH013][images/common.jpg]Original Intent: A Fact-Based Media [Contents.html#CH013a]The First Amendment goal of producing an informed public . . .

FCC, Majority Opinion, 1969, The Warren Supreme CourtBehind the Scenes, Billionaires’ Growing Control of News [headline]2[Notes.html#C13F02]—Jim Rutenberg, New York Times, May 28, 2016FOCUSING SOLELY ON THE founding fathers’ and the framers’ intent to avoidcorruption by ending pay-to-play will leave unaddressed their equally graveconcern with the quality of information available to voters.The unique contributions of the nation’s founders were the Bill of Rights andtheir expansion of the franchise, which they achieved by sharply reducing thehigh property standards for male voters in contemporary republics of the day. Atthe extreme, leaders in 1777 of what became Vermont entirely delinked thefranchise from financial circumstances.3 [Notes.html#C13F03]The framers realized that a greatly expanded franchise renders a democracyvulnerable if it is not complemented by voters armed with facts. As thischapter’s epigraph notes, one goal A key objective of their First Amendment wasan “informed public,” free of temptation by fabulists.They wrote and spoke repeatedly of the dangers posed to the new nation bycharlatans or demagogues seeking partisan gain or profit byinflaming andmisleading voters with what we today call fake news. As noted in theIntroduction, Elbridge Gerry worried about voters being duped by “pretendpatriots. In Massachusetts it had been fully confirmed by experience, that theyare daily misled into the most baneful measures and opinions, by the falsereports circulated by designing men, and which no one on the spot can refute.”4[Notes.html#C13F04] And Madison in Federalist 63 coveted fact-based votersresistant to “artful misrepresentations by interested men.”5 [Notes.html#C13F05]He later explained the urgency of an electorate armed with fact-basedinformation as noted earlier: “A popular government, without popularinformation, or the means of acquiring it, is but a prologue to a farce or atragedy; or perhaps both. Knowledge will forever govern ignorance; and a peoplewho mean to be their own governors must arm themselves with the power whichknowledge gives.”6 [Notes.html#C13F06]Constitutional Framers: The Vital Role of a Free PressThe framers envisaged a key role for a free press in providing a fact-basedforum. One of their remedies for fake news was to build a central role for themedia of the day—newspapers and broadsheets—into the nation’s architecture. Theycreated the concept of a free press in hopes that the media would serve as afact-based narrator, investigator, reporter, truth-teller, and commentator onpolitics and policy free of government or other influence. Their naïve hopeswere quickly dashed. Too many media owners since colonial times have exercisedtheir independence to misinform and mislead the public, molding public opinionto mirror their own biases. Thomas Jefferson in 1800 attributed the disingenuousand malicious coverage of politics in the new nation in “great degree” to theninety colonial era newspaper proprietors disseminating fake news: “I deplore .. . the putrid state into which our newspapers have passed and the malignity,the vulgarity, and mendacious spirit of those who write for them.”7[Notes.html#C13F07]The Revolutionary War and the War of 1812 were replete with fake news intendedto enhance American fervor using bogus reports of massacres by Indians alliedwith the British.8 [Notes.html#C13F08] Indeed, the colonial era and theantebellum era that followed featured harshly partisan local broadsheets. By the1920s, economies of scale had enabled some media firms to grow sufficientlylarge to reshape public opinion and preferences nationwide. Fictitious claimswere still commonly disseminated.9 [Notes.html#C13F09] As Sigmund Freud’sAmerican nephew, Edward Bernays, explained, “our minds are molded, our tastesformed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of.”10[Notes.html#C13F10] Indeed, American media proprietors of the day werecontinuing a practice reaching back thousands of years in history, includingweaponized fake news deployed during the Roman civil war circa 35 BC betweenMark Antony and Octavian.11 [Notes.html#C13F11]The threat of fake news to democracy feared by the framers reached new heightswith the marriage of state-directed propaganda and radio in the 1930s.Authoritarians in Russia, Germany, Italy, and elsewhere utilized slick audioversions of fake news to cement dictatorships. In politics, that period was themost prominent precedent for the dramatic surge in weaponized fake news byRussians and partisan Americans seeking to sway voters in 2016.The Fairness Doctrine: The Rights of Viewers Trump the Rights of BroadcastersIn reaction to the biased news foisted on the public by foreign authoritariansand news barons of the 1930s and 1940s, Congress successfully upgraded thequality of information to voters. Like the framers, Congress hoped to elevatethe media to an unbiased and nonpartisan source of news. Government investmentplayed a key role in the R&D that produced broadcast technology, so Congresscentered its reforms on media outlets that exploited government-funded R&D.Public radio and television were supported. And after considerable contemplationand debate, a policy known as the Fairness Doctrine was devised for privatebroadcasters. Not originally reliant on government R&D, print media wereexcluded. Enacted by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) under PresidentTruman in 1949, the Fairness Doctrine was extremely successful in meetingoriginal intent. It reined in partisanship and extremism in broadcast reporting.The process featured self-regulation with proprietors filtering content toachieve factual and nonpartisan objectivity in the discussion of policy andpolitics.The doctrine’s central principle was an obligation for broadcasters to givefactual coverage to all sides of issues and to all candidates. It also includedequal time for a prompt response by those victimized by on-air attacks.Importantly, proprietor filtration proved remarkably effective—producingfact-based, unbiased, and judicious presentations. The logic of the FairnessDoctrine was explained by Princeton politics professor Jan-Werner Müller inJanuary 2016: “An election, after all, can be undemocratic even if the rulingparty refrains from stuffing ballot boxes. If opposition parties have beenhindered in making their case to the electorate . . . the ballot boxes havealready been stuffed.”12 [Notes.html#C13F12]Proprietors of broadcast properties argued that the doctrine’s obligationsamounted to content censorship, violating their First Amendment rights. TheWarren Supreme Court disagreed, pointing to the media’s central role envisagedby the framers in a democracy. In Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC (1969), theyfound the doctrine constitutional, concluding that it furthered “the right ofthe public to receive suitable access to social, political, esthetic, moral andother ideas and experiences . . . [and] the First Amendment goal of producing aninformed public capable of conducting its own affairs . . .”13[Notes.html#C13F13]Media proprietors were galled that the FCC regulation compelled them to provideexposure to opinions expressed by those unable to purchase airtime. The WarrenSupreme Court highlighted this concern in Red Lion; Judge Guido Calabresi of theUS Court of Appeals for the Second District explained their thinking in hisDecember 2011 concurring opinion in Ognibene et al. v. Parkes et al.:For an articulation of this concern—i.e., that, without regulation, the wealthywould be able to use their wealth to overwhelm the voices of the poor—one needlook no further than the Supreme Court’s decision in Red Lion Broadcasting Co.v. FCC (1969) where, in upholding the FCC’s “fairness doctrine,” the High Courtlong ago explained that, without the rule in place, “station owners and a fewnetworks would have unfettered power to make time available only to the highestbidders” and thereby broadcast only those bidders’ political views; (againquoting Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC). “Just as the Government may limit theuse of sound-amplifying equipment potentially so noisy that it drowns outcivilized private speech, so may the Government limit the use of broadcastequipment. The right of free speech of a broadcaster, the user of a sound truck,or any other individual does not embrace a right to snuff out the free speech ofothers.”14 [Notes.html#C13F14]Broadcast proprietors were further galled that the FCC regulation mandatedcoverage of opinions they disfavored. Indeed, gaining the autonomy to torpedooriginal intent by unilaterally skewing information to voters was the goaluppermost in broadcasters’ minds as events unfolded in 1987 during the Reaganadministration: Edward O. Fritts, president of the National Association ofBroadcasters, described the doctrine as “an intrusion into broadcasters’journalistic judgment.”15 [Notes.html#C13F15] The Warren Court had alreadyrejected that concern, holding that it was unconstitutional for proprietors tofoist only their opinions and ideologies on voters. The Red Lion Broadcastingruling insisted that “it is the right of viewers and listeners, not the right ofthe broadcasters, which is paramount.”16 [Notes.html#C13F16]Collapse of the Fairness Doctrine: Talk Radio, Fox News, and SinclairBroadcasting GroupBy 1987 President Reagan was in a position to respond to the ardent parochialdesires of broadcasters. He had appointed industry straw men to the FCC asopenings occurred, and finally had the votes to kill the Fairness Doctrine. Analarmed Congress reacted, with large bipartisan majorities voting to codify thedoctrine into law in order to shield it from Reagan. The Senate passed suchlegislation in April by a vote of 59–31 and the House followed suit on June 3,1987, by a vote of 302–102.17 [Notes.html#C13F17] But Reagan vetoed thelegislation, and his appointees to the FCC soon thereafter killed the doctrine.Its abandonment has meant the only constraints that broadcasters confront inpressing their personal ideologies on voters are the de minimus “equal time” and“reasonable access” rules promulgated by the FCC more than eighty years ago(1934). And those rules serve only to prevent gross injustices such as refusalto sell comparable airtime for campaign ads to all (financially able) candidatesat comparable ad rates.18 [Notes.html#C13F18] The new environment it ushered inwas aptly described by A.J. Liebling: “Freedom of the press is guaranteed onlyto those who own one.19 [Notes.html#C13F19]In the years since Ronald Reagan mocked original intent, broadcasters haveabandoned objectivity in favor of an afactual, partisan din. Fables foisted asreality have become commonplace, buttressed by demonizing and discreditingfact-based investigative reporting. The ensuing polarization of voters hascaused the moderate center of US politics to dwindle, with Americans now oftenselecting only their own ideologically compatible information regardless offactual content.20 [Notes.html#C13F20]Data indicate these trends are especially evident on the right, with some 40percent of voters who supported candidate Trump in 2016, for instance, citingconservative Fox News rather than fact-based mainstream media as their “mainsource” of information. In contrast, the main news sources for Clinton voterswere scattered among CNN (18 percent), MSNBC (9 percent), local TV (8 percent),National Public Radio, and ABC (each at 7 percent).21 [Notes.html#C13F21] Thatis significant because Fox News is an especially active purveyor of fake,afactual news, evidenced in a survey by Fairleigh Dickinson political scientistDan Cassino. Some 52 percent of Fox News viewers still believed as late as 2015the bogus claim that weapons of mass destruction had been found following theinvasion of Iraq. Only 14 percent of MSNBC viewers were still fooled.22[Notes.html#C13F22]Recall it was Frank Rich who contended that Fox was instrumental, in cooperationwith the Koch brothers, in empowering the Tea Party movement. Its owner, RupertMurdoch, is a charter member (with the Scaifes, Coors, Ricketts, and Kochs) inwhat Jane Mayer describes as “a small, rarefied group of hugely wealthy,archconservative families that for decades poured money, often with littlepublic exposure, into influencing how the Americans thought and voted.”23[Notes.html#C13F23]The Democrats certainly bend in some measure to the will of their own donorclass. But the fittest fifty enjoy far greater sway on the right, their agendamorphing into that of the Republican Party, aggressively propagated byconservative media outlets. The most impactful exemplar is the SinclairBroadcasting conglomerate (read on). Less important if far better known is theFox cable news channel. Fox News under Roger Ailes emerged as the most faithfuland effective inheritor of Reagan, peddling the animus of the fittest fiftytoward higher wages, public education, collective bargaining, and governmentprograms that expand scientific knowledge and opportunity. A Pew survey inOctober 2014 found that few moderates or liberals watch Fox because of itsslanted reporting. In contrast, 47 percent of those self-identifying as“consistently conservative” named Fox as their “main source for government andpolitical news”; some 84 percent obtained political news from Fox in theprevious week.24 [Notes.html#C13F24] Fox News cable viewership is sizable enoughthat the Pew Research Center in December 2016 found more Americans believed FoxNews than National Public Radio.25 [Notes.html#C13F25]Fox has cornered a portion of the market for conservative TV viewership dollarsin the same fashion that Donald Trump won the 2016 GOP presidential nomination,by being the most extreme, hyperbolic, and often fact-free critic of governmentand all things progressive. This strategy is facilitated by its on-air model,blending opinion with partisan, slanted, and too often afactual reporting. Thenetwork disseminates misleading or fake news with fanfare, only rarely andbelatedly offering muted retractions or corrections. During the 2008 election,Fox News disseminated numerous bogus claims to demonize candidate Obama. Indeed,some 30 percent of Fox News viewers in 2015 still believed the birtherism canardthat he was not a citizen (another 9 percent remained uncertain); only 7 percentof MSNBC viewers remained snookered.26 [Notes.html#C13F26] And during the 2016political campaign, Fox News was a global sound truck for sensational partisanfabrications, some sourced by Russian cyber hackers. They readily airedfantasies (terrorist attack in Sweden!) and repeatedly hosted poseurs offictitious provenance such as Nils Bildt.27 [Notes.html#C13F27] Today, it is byfar the most favored outlet for interviews by President Donald Trump.Fox News presenters and articulate alternative-reality radio hosts such as GlennBeck and Rush Limbaugh have infused the conservative movement with such a senseof camaraderie, excitement, and purpose that 84 percent of self-identified TeaPartiers by 2010 believed that their “movement generally reflects the views ofmost Americans.” In reality, that same poll found that only 25 percent ofrespondents nationally believed that Tea Partiers reflect the views of mostAmericans.28 [Notes.html#C13F28]The nation’s largest TV conglomerate, Sinclair Broadcasting Group of beautifulHunt Valley, Maryland, is a less conspicuous but more powerful advocate of theGOP and the fittest fifty agenda. With deregulation, it had grown from threestations in 1996 to 173 by 2016. And under Trump, the Federal CommunicationsCommission relaxed legal limits in 2017, allowing Sinclair to expand to 215stations. Its sweep enables it to wield more influence than Fox in shapingpublic attitudes. For example, once he secured the GOP nomination, candidateTrump restricted TV interviews mostly to alternative-reality media platformssuch as Fox News and Sinclair, eschewing news conferences entirely. Firstrevealed by Politico, based on a speech to donors by Trump son-in-law JaredKushner, the arrangement with Sinclair was described this way by Paul Farhi ofthe Washington Post. “The Trump campaign struck a deal with Sinclair to provideaccess and coverage . . . Sinclair’s stations, particularly in swing states suchas Ohio and Florida, reached a far greater audience in their local areas than anational network . . . A review of Sinclair’s reporting and internal documentsshow a strong tilt toward Trump . . . while often casting Clinton in anunfavorable light.”29 [Notes.html#C13F29]The Sinclair conglomerate aired thirty-one exclusive interviews, for instance,after July 2016 with Trump, his running mate Mike Pence, or campaign surrogatessuch as Ben Carson compared to seven with the Clinton campaign. Some were aslong as eighteen minutes and most were distributed to stations as “must-run”stories. Moreover, Sinclair’s on-air commentators, such as executive Mark Hyman,routinely traffic in fake news, arguing breathlessly on October 27, 2016, forinstance, that “Most Americans know very little about the leaked Clinton emails.Major news organizations buried the most damaging. So we’re sharing them withyou.” Factual news that cast GOP candidates in a poor light went unreported,including Trump’s failure to release medical or tax records or to document thejustification for his Vietnam War era draft deferments. Sinclair had previouslyaired fake news in 2004, impugning Democratic candidate John Kerry’s service inVietnam. In 2016, its TV stations in Pittsburgh persisted in airing attack adsagainst Democratic senate candidate Joe Sestak despite knowing they containedfalsehoods.30 [Notes.html#C13F30]The conservative media have had considerable success in sowing distrust ofgovernment programs and elevating tribalism. For example, Pew Research Centerpolling in 2015 found that three-quarters of conservative respondents believedgovernment benefits enable the impoverished to “have it easy.” Only one in sevenacknowledged the reality that the poor “have it hard.”31 [Notes.html#C13F31] Bemindful that we are talking about the 22 percent of Americans who work two jobsto make ends meet.32 [Notes.html#C13F32] Or the 42 percent of Americans livingin or near poverty, earning less than $15 per hour, and the 46 percent ofAmericans unable to scrape together $400 in cash to meet an emergency.33[Notes.html#C13F33] They live paycheck to paycheck in a downtrodden lifestyledescribed by Barbara Ehrenreich in Nickled and Dimed, and by Kathryn Edin and H.Luke Shaefer in $2 a Day: Living on Almost Nothing in America. How strapped arethey for cash? Look to Virginia where one-sixth of motorists (more than 900,000)lost their licenses in 2015 because of their inability to pay modest court finesand fees.34 [Notes.html#C13F34]In contrast, absent from the conservative media are reports of malfeasance bythe fittest or the business sector’s suppression of wages, job offshoring infavor of profits, and routine use of corporate tax havens. Indeed, Fox News hasgood reason to downplay the latter, since its highly profitable Australianparent 21st Century Fox (Rupert Murdoch’s original News Corporation) pays lessthan a 1 percent tax rate.35 [Notes.html#C13F35] It is viewed by the AustralianTaxation Office as the most egregious tax dodger in that nation.36[Notes.html#C13F36]The conservative media deflect middle-class attention from wage stagnation,facilitating the GOP pursuit of the fittest agenda by stoking race and classresentment. Former Washington Post columnist Harold Meyerson explained that it“tapped into and built a right-wing populism that focuses the white workingclass’s blame for its woes downward—at the racial other—rather than up.”37[Notes.html#C13F37] It is Jim Crow era class incitement updated to includeLatinos and city dwellers.[images/star.jpg]The Democratic Party certainly has partisan advocates in the media such as theHuffington Post, but audience data confirm they are outgunned by Sinclair andFox. As we see in the next chapter, the 2016 election cycle saw America’senergetic and entrepreneurial conservatives expand beyond broadcast media to beeager innovators in the explosion of partisan and fake news on social mediaplatforms."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 14 [Contents.html#CH014][images/common.jpg]Fake News Exacerbates Political Polarization, Tribalism, and the Income Bias[Contents.html#CH014a]We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016aimed at the US presidential election . . .

Itfractures the centrality of collaborative governance: wisdom derived from a bodyof commonly accepted facts that form the basis for informed decision making bycitizens, facilitating tolerance and moderation in public affairs. Fake newsdilutes that wisdom, thereby posing an existential danger to high-qualitydemocracy. That danger was dramatized in 2016, when fake news surged, allowing aspread of misinformation by partisans akin to Elbridge Gerry’s “pretendpatriots.” Political analyst Richard Heydarian described the consequence of thatelection: “Voices that were lurking in the shadows are now at the center of thepublic discourse.”3 [Notes.html#C14F03]This surge occurred on outlets such as Fox News that cater to conservatives. Butit was also powerfully disseminated in an unprecedented fashion on social mediaplatforms or POPS—privately owned public spaces—including Facebook, Google(including YouTube), and Twitter. Inexpensive, unfiltered, and hyperaccessiblesocial media communications have supplanted much of the traditionalinformational functions of broadcast and print media for Americans under the ageof fifty. Some 57 percent of Americans in a July 2016 Pew survey citedtelevision among their news sources while online sources overall were citedsecond at 38 percent. But that disguises a huge generational gap. The internetwas cited as the most frequent news source by Americans under the age of fifty;for those under age thirty, it was cited first by a 2:1 margin over TV.4[Notes.html#C14F04] This seismic shift in news sources is documented by thereaction of marketers, who have rationally shifted ad placements online. Digitaladvertising now rivals the $70 billion spent on TV.5 [Notes.html#C14F05]This transformation poses a considerable challenge to prospects for an informedelectorate. Potentially malicious or mendacious corner soapbox rants accessibleto a handful within hearing distance just a few years ago are abruptly nowaccessible to billions. The surge of fake news during the 2016 election marks asea change, casting yet another shadow over the quality of American democracy.Jonathan Taplin, Director Emeritus of the Annenberg Innovation Lab at theUniversity of Southern California explains: “The original mission of theinternet was hijacked by a small group of right-wing radicals to whom the ideasof democracy and decentralization were anathema.”6 [Notes.html#C14F06] EvenTwitter founder Evan Williams is dismayed by the extremism and toxicityabounding as entrepreneurs and partisans glamorize or monetize the outlandishand far worse on social media: “And it’s a lot more obvious to a lot of peoplethat it’s broken . . . I thought once everybody could speak freely and exchangeinformation and ideas, the world is automatically going to be a better place. Iwas wrong about that.”7 [Notes.html#C14F07] Indeed, the level of toxicity isstunning: The Pew Research Center has found that four in ten internet users havebeen harassed online—and these are adult users, not adolescents or youths.8[Notes.html#C14F08] And according to the Washington Post, 4 percent of internetusers, including Marine Corps personnel, are victims of explicit images.9[Notes.html#C14F09]This trend will persist because, while voters tend to be skeptics about generalnews sources, a sizable minority of Americans seemingly have yet to developskepticism for information gleaned from cyberspace. That especially includesyounger Americans, the most internet-reliant cohort. For example, researchers atthe Stanford Graduate School of Education in 2016 tested student acumen inevaluating the sourcing of internet information, a key variable determiningviewer trust. Their analysis of some 7,800 students nationwide found they“predominantly relied on social media for news.” No surprise there. Yet, thestudents proved to be quite inept at assessing the veracity of informationbecause they failed to discriminate between news sources: a remarkable 93percent were unable to winnow fact from fake news. The researchers found thattest subjects accepted at face value self-serving claims and misleading graphicsmade by special interest groups including financial information proffered by abank advertisement, information from the National Rifle Association, orcommentary by employers opposed to minimum wages. The analysts found “adismaying inability by students to reason about information they see on theinternet. Students, for example, had a hard time distinguishing advertisementsfrom news articles or identifying where information came from . . . Many peopleassume that because young people are fluent in social media they are equallyperceptive about what they find there. Our work shows the opposite to be true .. .”10 [Notes.html#C14F10]Fake News Is Circulated More Widely Than Factual NewsThe Stanford analysis reveals a generalized weakness among Americans of all agesin identifying fake news, evidenced by the willingness of many internet users tocirculate bogus postings as readily as they circulate factual news stories.Twitter provides the data. Professor Philip Howard and colleagues at OxfordUniversity’s Internet Institute evaluated all 138,686 tweets of a politicalnature sent by residents of Michigan during ten days ending on November 11,2016, surrounding the election. The sharing of links on social media likeTwitter is a persuasive signal that users consider the information important andcredible. Slightly more than 24,000 of these political tweets included links andthus were subsequently evaluated. Some 23 percent of those links (5,615) provedto be to fake news stories. This volume nearly equaled the number of linkstweeted to stories originating with fact-based media (5,668).11[Notes.html#C14F11] However, when links to Russian-origin news stories and tounverified WikiLeaks news reports were added, the volume of searches involvingpolitical fake news sources surpassed professional news sources.12[Notes.html#C14F12]In a separate analysis, the news website BuzzFeed also concluded that fake newswas shared among Facebook users more than real news.13 [Notes.html#C14F13]Fake News Is Widely BelievedWhen a large pool of Americans with underdeveloped skills in evaluating newssources enter into an ecosystem of factual and fake news on POPS platforms, manymillions are certain to be misled. That outcome was quantified by New YorkUniversity professor Hunt Allcott and Stanford professor Matthew Gentzkow in thewake of the 2016 election. Survey data of voters they evaluated found that onlyabout 15 percent (14.1 percent and 15.3 percent in two waves) of respondentsrecalled seeing fake news on social media during the election, such as the Popeendorsing candidate Trump. That’s the good news. The bad news is that over halfof those viewers (59 percent and 52 percent in the two waves) believed thefables.14 [Notes.html#C14F14] That suggests about 11 million American voterswere misled in 2016, an enormous cohort who both saw and believed fake news.Political scientists have not yet measured the impact of fake news on the 2016balloting. If these 11 million snookered voters disproportionately selectedPresident Trump, the outcome may have been influenced. A definitive answer iselusive, however, because any misled Trump (or Clinton) voter may have alreadybeen committed; viewing the fake news merely served to reinforce a preexistingbias. Political scientists call that syndrome “confirmation bias,” where viewersseek out or best retain information that fuels preexisting opinion. What seemscertain is that millions of American voters were influenced in some measure byfake news. After all, BuzzFeed concluded that the fake news story about PopeFrancis endorsing Donald Trump was the single most visited item of news onFacebook in the three months before the US election.15 [Notes.html#C14F15]Conservatives Have Proven Disproportionately Susceptible to Fake NewsResearch surrounding the 2016 election has produced other notable findings.Perhaps most importantly, political scientists have concluded that conservativevoters are unduly inclined to believe fake news. The machinations involving fakenews during the 2016 presidential election led to the discovery thatconservatives are considerably more suggestible than other Americans. Thisconclusion is based on real-world data and the experience of entrepreneurs inthe media marketplace.Fake news websites proffering political information in 2016 were divided betweenfor-profit ventures and ideological, partisan ventures on behalf of candidates.Beginning in the spring of 2016, for-profit sites carrying political newsproliferated at the hands of hundreds of entrepreneurs, including folks such asJohn Egan of Vancouver, Beqa Latsabidze of Tbilisi, Georgia, and a number ofMacedonian computer experts from the town of Veles.16 [Notes.html#C14F16] Thebusiness model was to entice viewers on Facebook and other social mediaplatforms to click over to (linked) for-profit websites festooned with ads.Initially agnostic about US politics, these international entrepreneurs triedgenerating clicks for websites with hyperbolic postings using pro-Clintonthemes, football themes, food themes, and anti-Clinton/pro-Trump themes. Thiscottage industry soon discovered through trial and error that Trump supporterswere far more prone to respond to their fallacious posts, many merely respondingto hoax headlines alone. They were readily gulled and thus held the greatestpromise of profit. These entrepreneurs quickly honed in withpro-Trump/anti-Clinton fake news posting on POPS platforms in order to drivetraffic to mendacious websites with names like TrumpVision365.com,USConservativeToday.com, and DonaldTrumpNews.com. According to the Guardian, theVeles contingent of cyber profiteers alone ended up creating 150 sites bashingClinton, some allegedly receiving 1 million visits monthly.17[Notes.html#C14F17] (Mr. Latsabidze’s hoax that Mexico would close its borderwith the US should Trump be elected was the third-most-trafficked story onFacebook between May and July 2016 according to Buzzfeed.)18 [Notes.html#C14F18]American web entrepreneurs made the same discovery and also quickly pivoted toprofit from gullible Trump supporters. The star is Brandon Vallorani, whoseLiberty Alliance grossed $11 million in 2016. His forty employeesproduced/copied incendiary content that pandered to the right and far-right,using 176 Facebook identities during the election to drive tens of millions offollowers to his websites.19 [Notes.html#C14F19] (You read that figurecorrectly.) San Francisco computer experts and former waiters Paris Wade and BenGoldman similarly used Facebook to drive traffic to their anti-Clinton siteLiberty Writers News. Daily dashing off flamboyant 400-word fake stories, theyearned tens of thousands of dollars monthly from clicks on their website.Another prominent practitioner of fake news for profit, Paul Horner, admitted inlate 2016 that customizing bogus claims for undiscerning conservatives washighly profitable: “Honestly, people . . . just keep passing stuff around.Nobody fact-checks anything anymore—I mean, that’s how Trump got elected. Hejust said whatever he wanted, and people believed everything, and when thethings he said turned out not to be true, people didn’t care because they’dalready accepted it. It’s real scary. I’ve never seen anything like it.”20[Notes.html#C14F20]This massive pivot to hoodwink conservatives by entrepreneurs across the globehas been documented. For example, BuzzFeed found that seventeen of the twentymost popular fake news sites on Facebook in the last three months of the 2016election cycle were either pro-Trump or anti-Clinton.21 [Notes.html#C14F21]Political scientists researching Tea Party loyalists earlier had identified thesame characteristic vulnerability, as noted by Skocpol and Williamson: “At timesto be sure, national rightwing advocates and media stars are handling out a loadof bull to grassroots Tea Party people, who accept outlandish claims a bit tooreadily. In meetings and interviews, we found that misinformation was prevalentamong Tea Party supporters . . . Tea partiers seem to be trusting to the pointof gullibility.”22 [Notes.html#C14F22]Important in a broader context, as Cornell economist Nancy Folbre explains,their gullibility and brand loyalty in the face of counterfactuals also meansthat party grassroots are unaware how quickly the Republican lawmakers theyelect, like Andy Barr, switch loyalties. Lawmakers soon ignore constituentconcerns to pander to the fittest fifty agenda of raising profits at the expenseof wages, with constituents left in the dark: “Many Tea party members may beunaware of the extent to which wealthy political conservatives like the Kochbrothers have controlled their efforts and shaped legislative priorities.”23[Notes.html#C14F23]Fake News for Partisan GainIn addition to fake news propagated by profit seekers, innumerable websites andsocial media postings were and are still crafted for partisan gain alone,including by the Russian government. And there is a third category of bogusonline information disseminators who blend profit with ideology andpartisanship.* [Chapter14.html#C14a] Aside from Fox News and Sinclair, theyinclude the National Enquirer, Breitbart News, talk radio, InfoWars, the DailyCaller, Liberty Alliance, Truthfeed, and entrepreneurial fabricators such asCameron Harris of Annapolis, Maryland, owner of the siteChristianTimesNewspaper.com. Like others, Harris was stunned by the gullibilityof those conservatives drawn by his mendacity: “At first it kind of shockedme—the response I was getting. How easily people would believe it [bogusanti-Clinton screeds].”24 [Notes.html#C14F24]Some web authors are cyber sophisticates, utilizing innovations such asautomated Twitter accounts or bots that disseminate programmed information involume with very little human input. In fact, Professor Howard at OxfordUniversity found that a fifth of the tweets his team examined in the last weekof the election were generated by high volume users—fifty or more posts daily—asignal that they were likely automated bots. And by nearly a 3:1 margin (78,662vs. 28,074), they disseminated pro-Trump, anti-Clinton messages, designed toattract attention with alluring captions beneath bizarre pictures.25[Notes.html#C14F25] Moreover, the location of the bots suggested to experts thatthey focused their political messages on users in important swing states such asFlorida.26 [Notes.html#C14F26]The gullibility of grassroots conservatives and their tendency to self-selectfor right-wing news disseminators does not surprise Republican politicalprofessionals. Former Romney presidential campaign advisor Ted Newton explainsthat their conservative convictions “almost made them slaves to those newsoutlets. So there is a whole group of people who will only watch Fox, who willonly read Breitbart News. And they are living in a bubble.”27[Notes.html#C14F27] Retired conservative radio host Charlie Sykes describes manyof his listeners in the same vein: “You can be in this alternative media realityand there’s no way to break through it.”28 [Notes.html#C14F28] Other Republicansagree, including George W. Bush speechwriter David Frum: “Too often,conservatives dupe themselves. They wrap themselves in closed informationsystems based upon pretend information . . . [e.g.] tax cuts always pay forthemselves . . . This is how to understand the Glenn Beck phenomenon. Every day,Beck offers alternative knowledge—an alternative history of the United Statesand the world, an alternative system of economics, an alternative reality.”29[Notes.html#C14F29]Between being targeted with fake news and their confirmation bias, the GOPgrassroots is not well informed about political or economic issues, nor of theinvaluable role government has played for two centuries in expanding Americanprosperity. Indeed, the GOP electoral base has become so fact-challenged as toalarm even some conservatives. Here is Jennifer Rubin, writing in May 2016:“Conservatives must end their infatuation with phony news, conspiracy theoriesand demonization of well-meaning leaders. It is time to grow up, turn off SeanHannity, get off toxic social media and start learning about the world as it is. . . [It] has become pathological.”30 [Notes.html#C14F30]Feeding American conservatives a diet of partisan Republican opinion withslanted and fake news is hugely profitable for Fox News, Breitbart News,entrepreneurs such as Vallorani, and talk radio hosts such as Rush Limbaugh.However, their success means that too many Americans have settled into comfortzones where facts are merely one option among many on the information dashboard:President Obama was not born in America; Serena Williams uses banned substances;4 million people fraudulently voted for Hillary Clinton; New Jersey Muslimsboisterously celebrated 9/11; President Obama wiretapped Trump Tower.The gullibility regarding fake news that emerged in 2016 on the American rightputs the lie to Alexis de Tocqueville’s 1830s observation in Democracy inAmerica: “I do not think that there is a single country in the world where, inproportion to the population, there are so few ignorant . . . individuals as inAmerica.”Delegitimizing Fact-Based Journalism to Polarize the Electorate for PartisanGainWeaponized fake news has bolstered the GOP, and its fabulists present anotherbarrier to ending the income bias. Recall Fox News’s role in promoting the TeaParty at the behest of the Kochs and Rupert Murdoch. That role was reprised inrecent years by the Mercer family in providing millions of dollars to the superPAC Make American Number 1 and the nationalist Breitbart News website.31[Notes.html#C14F31] The risks posed by such behavior to the quality of democracyare one reason that higher quality democracies explicitly limit their fittest’sability to bend politics. In Harper v. Canada (2004), for example, the CanadianSupreme Court expressed fears for any society where “the affluent . . . dominatethe political discourse . . . This unequal dissemination of points of viewundermines the voter’s ability to be adequately informed of all views.”32[Notes.html#C14F32]The sheer scope of cyber entrepreneurialism in 2016 means the fittest fiftyactually played only a modest role in the explosion of fake news. Nonetheless,its agenda has been greatly furthered by the ensuing GOP electoral successes.The central role played by fake news in today’s Republican Party is rooted inthe aftermath of the 1964 Goldwater campaign when a narrative emerged, assertingthe outcome reflected a liberal media bias. Richard Hofstadter wrote then of theparanoid beliefs of GOP grassroots, that “America has been largely taken awayfrom them . . .”33 [Notes.html#C14F33] That narrative has been embellishedsince. The George W. Bush administration mocked the “reality-based community” ofthe New York Times. “That’s not the way the world works anymore . . . we createour own reality.”34 [Notes.html#C14F34] Mitt Romney’s pollster in 2012, NeilNewhouse, declared: “We’re not going to let our campaign be dictated by factcheckers.”35 [Notes.html#C14F35] President Trump has gone considerably further,making warfare on fact-checkers a central element of his administration’s publicoutreach strategy. Doubts are raised. Independent purveyors of facts rangingfrom the New York Times to Snopes and Factcheck.org [http://Factcheck.org] arelabeled fake news sources. The mainstream media is routinely termed the “fakenews industry” by President Trump himself, demonized as an “enemy of theAmerican people . . . The press is out of control, the level of dishonesty isout of control.”36 [Notes.html#C14F36] President Trump also routinely punchesdown at “disgusting reporters . . . scum,” asserting, “They’re very, verydishonest people . . .”37 [Notes.html#C14F37]Scholars studying the use of fake news (it’s called “agnotology”) emphasize itsgoal to raise doubts about the truth by creating and then sustaining controversyregarding awkward facts. They explain that the GOP and President Trump’sreliance on fake news mimics tactics used by the postwar tobacco industryanxious to obfuscate the fact that tobacco use caused cancer: All facts arepreliminary; studies are merely anecdotal or statistical manipulations; expertsdisagreed; critics had hidden agendas; it’s unsettled science; wait for the bestpeople to get a real answer.38 [Notes.html#C14F38]This mimicry of the tobacco industry by President Trump in casting doubt onmainstream fact-based reporting has been astoundingly successful. Survey datafrom the Pew Research Center in March 2017 found that a sharp divide was openedin 2016 between how Democrats and Republicans perceive news organizations. Some89 percent of Democratic adults agreed, for instance, that news organizations“keep political leaders from doing things that shouldn’t be done.” Only 42percent of Republicans respondents agreed with this watchdog role, creating thewidest gap by far in this survey series that began in 1985.39[Notes.html#C14F39]One of the most notable statistics in this book is a Gallup finding that onlyone-third (32 percent) of Americans in 2016 toward the end of the electionexpressed “trust and confidence” in the mainstream media. That share has fallenby more than half from 72 percent in 1976 before Ronald Reagan launched the GOPassault on moderation in public affairs by abandoning the Fairness Doctrine.40[Notes.html#C14F40] With only one-third of Americans expressing confidence infact-based reporting, the nation is no longer the collaborative postwardemocracy that routinely reached compromise on difficult issues such as civilrights on the basis of a widely accepted body of common facts. Indeed, a SuffolkUniversity–USA Today survey in March 2017 found that 34 percent of registeredvoters agreed that mainstream media outlets are “the enemy of the Americanpeople.”41 [Notes.html#C14F41] The GOP’s war on the press has convincedone-in-three Americans that facts derived from investigative reporting are theirenemy.GOP officials’ adoption of the destructive strategy of polarizing fake newssignals how their powerfully aggressive pursuit of the fittest fifty agenda hasoverruled the Republicans’ democratic—and conservative—roots. The intellectualfather of modern conservatism, Milton Friedman, for example, acknowledged thatfacts are an inestimable pillar in sustaining a quality democracy. In his famous1955 essay, he wrote that a “stable and democratic society is impossible withoutwidespread acceptance of some common set of values and without a minimum degreeof literacy and knowledge on the part of most citizens.”42 [Notes.html#C14F42]In wielding fake news as a cudgel to demonize the mainstream press, theRepublican Party and especially Donald Trump are precisely mimicking Europeanand Japanese authoritarians in the 1930s; Richard Nixon in the 1970s; and morerecently Silvio Berlusconi, Hugo Chavez, Vladimir Putin, and Recep Erdoğan.Sykes explains the vital role played by its partisan supporters on talk radio,Fox News, and the like in polarizing the nation:Instead, we opened the door for President Trump, who found an audience thatcould be easily misled . . . the more the fact-based media tries to debunk thepresident’s falsehoods, the further it will entrench the battle lines . . . Hecan do this because members of the Trump administration feel confident that thealternative-reality media will provide air cover, even if they are caughtfabricating facts or twisting words (like claiming that the “ban” on Muslimimmigrants wasn’t really a “ban”). Indeed, they believe they have shifted theparadigm of media coverage, replacing the traditional media with their own.43[Notes.html#C14F43]Today’s alternative-reality media includes conservative commentator RushLimbaugh who regularly argues that “Fake News is the everyday [mainstream media]news . . . They just make it up.”44 [Notes.html#C14F44] The consequentialdiminution of factual information for Americans is lamented by Sykes: “As welearned this year [2016], we had succeeded in persuading our audiences to ignoreand discount any information from the mainstream media. Over time, we’dsucceeded in delegitimizing the media altogether—all the normal guideposts weredown, the referees discredited . . . We destroyed our own immunity to fake news,while empowering the worst and most reckless voices on the right.”45[Notes.html#C14F45]Another conservative media figure, Oliver Darcy, adds:I’m a conservative talk show host. All conservative hosts have basicallyestablished their brand as being contrasted to the mainstream media. So we havespent 20 years demonizing the liberal mainstream media . . . [A]t a certainpoint you wake up and you realize you have destroyed the credibility of anycredible outlet out there. The analogy that I think of is somebody who has ababy alligator in their bathtub and they keep feeding it and taking care of it.And it’s really cute when it’s a baby alligator—until it becomes a grown-upalligator and comes out and starts biting you.”46 [Notes.html#C14F46]Their concern is echoed by other conservatives such as radio host John Ziegler:“Over the years, we’ve effectively brainwashed the core of our audience todistrust anything that they disagree with. And now it’s gone too far . . . Thegatekeepers have lost all credibility in the minds of consumers . . . You canonly be exposed to stories that make you feel good about what you want tobelieve. Unfortunately, the truth is unpopular a lot.”47 [Notes.html#C14F47]While being interviewed on Fox News by Megyn Kelly on January 21, 2014, achastened Glenn Beck acknowledged that many of his gullible viewers had become“fragile.” He said, “I played a role unfortunately in helping tear the countryapart. And it’s not who we are. I didn’t realize how really fragile the peoplewere. I thought we were kind of a little more in it together. And now I lookback and I realize if we could have talked about the uniting principles a littlemore, instead of just the problems . . .”48 [Notes.html#C14F48]In the wake of 2016, the hallmarks of twenty-first-century American democracyare a social media industry promulgating division and a Republican Party grownsuccessful with fake news fostering polarization. You may deplore this newreality, but others welcome it, including Russians eager to see America becomethe farce feared by Madison. The Trump campaign’s spinning of conspiracytheories while questioning America’s democratic process sowed distrust anddiscord, rather dramatically furthering Russian propaganda objectives. Bymendaciously claiming rigged elections and voter fraud, candidate and thenPresident Trump has utilized traditional Russian propaganda and misinformationtechniques to discredit American democracy. Moreover, he routinely calledattention to WikiLeaks information hacked by Russian cyber spooks,credentialing, rewarding, and incentivizing Kremlin intervention. TraditionalRepublican conservatives such as Robert Kagan were stunned by this de factoTrump–Putin collaboration: “It would have been impossible to imagine a year agothat the Republican Party’s leaders would be effectively serving as enablers ofRussian interference in this country’s political system. Yet, astonishingly,that is the role the Republican Party is playing.”49 [Notes.html#C14F49]On the world stage, America has championed the virtues of democracy, individualrights, and freedoms since World War II. Its economic and military might provideimportant sustenance to the higher quality democracies abroad whose politicalsystems do actually spread the gains from growth broadly. A fretful VladimirPutin has sought for nearly a decade to diminish the lure of such democraticgovernance. And his marquee success is the election of a president critical ofthe US democratic system and reluctant to reject white supremacists. American’simage worldwide has suffered. Pew Research Center polling in June 2017 found thenation’s favorability rating globally had fallen from 64 percent to 49 percentfollowing Trump’s first months in office. Pointing to his “arrogant” demeanor,Pew’s 40,000 global respondents expressed more confidence in the murderous Putin(27 percent) than in Trump (22 percent).50 [Notes.html#C14F50]It is unclear if Putin is accountable for the election of Donald Trump. ButRussian intervention certainly enhanced his relative appeal to American voters.How was that accomplished?Russian Cyber Espionage in Support of Donald TrumpVladimir Putin is hostile to democracy. He is especially annoyed byfact-checkers in the media at home or abroad. Unlike the GOP, however, Putin isable with impunity to do more domestically than merely demonize them in effortsto make facts miscible. More than a score of Russian investigative reportershave been murdered in unsolved crimes since 2009.51 [Notes.html#C14F51] Otherssit in jail at Putin’s behest, falsely accused.Abroad, the Russians have a history since 2009 of aggressive cyber interventionin the politics of the Baltic, Balkans, and Western democracies. Thisinterference is motivated by concern for the well-being and position of Putinand his close colleagues, with the goal of discrediting democracies abroadsufficiently to blur their sharp contrasts with his kleptocracy. Putin’sinterest in discrediting democracy rose sharply following the Arab Spring,including the “color revolutions” in Ukraine and across North Africa thatdisplaced authoritarians. The Kremlin began to covertly aid the election ofunconventional candidates in Europe and America to bring discredit on thedemocratic process. In 2014, Russia provided $10 million to Marine Le Pen’sxenophobic, fascist French National Front.52 [Notes.html#C14F52] In Holland in2016, fake news disseminated by Russian intelligence officials masquerading asUkrainians was responsible for Dutch voters rejecting a free trade agreementwith Ukraine; it took another year to expose the Russians and achieveratification. On TV and in public appearances, these poseurs demonized the newUkrainian democracy, repeating Kremlin mendacities such as Ukrainian troopsburned the Dutch flag or killed a three-year-old for wearing a crucifix.53[Notes.html#C14F53] Even so, most Russian misinformation was spread on socialmedia platforms.These and other similar events are elements of a pattern of “pervasive andendemic” Russian intervention in European elections documented by the Center forStrategic and International Studies in Washington and the Sofia, Bulgaria,Center for the Study of Democracy. Recent actions have focused on Eastern Europein addition to America, France, and the Netherlands.54 [Notes.html#C14F54] TheKremlin tactics featuring character assassination have scored considerablesuccess, flipping governments to pro-Russian leaders in Armenia, Georgia,Hungary, and Moldova.55 [Notes.html#C14F55]This Russian strategy, including leaked emails, was replicated in America during2016. For instance, its TV network RT broadcasting in America repeatedly smearedSecretary Clinton with fables such as “How 100 percent of the Clintons’ 2015‘charity’ went to . . . themselves.”56 [Notes.html#C14F56] The reach of thisKremlin propaganda became surprisingly broad among Americans. RT’sEnglish-language broadcasts streamed on Google’s YouTube platform were morewidely viewed, for instance, than CNN’s streaming news coverage.57[Notes.html#C14F57] And pro-Trump ads surreptitiously purchased by Russians onsocial media were widely viewed. In January 2017, the American intelligenceagencies explained the goals of such Russian intervention in the election thisway:We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016aimed at the US presidential election . . . Russia’s goals were to underminepublic faith in the US democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harmher electability and potential presidency. We further assess Putin and theRussian government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump . . .Putin and the Russian government aspired to help President-elect Trump’selection chances when possible by discrediting Secretary Clinton and publiclycontrasting her unfavorably to him.58 [Notes.html#C14F58]This intervention actually began in 2015. Russian military websites, includingGuccifer 2.0 (posing as Romanian freedom activists) and DCLeaks.com (posing asAmerican freedom activists) joined RT in seeding anti-Clinton fake news onsocial media platforms. The impact of this cyber warfare was enhanced because ofbreakdowns at the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), which is responsiblefor countering covert Russian espionage. As reported on December 14, 2016, bythe leading European business paper, the Financial Times, the FBI proved inept.Journalist David J. Lynch explained that the Russian cyber warriors exploited“short-handed Federal Bureau of Investigation counterintelligence units.”59[Notes.html#C14F59] And Luke Harding, Stephanie Kirchgaessner, and Mick Hopkinsof the Guardian quoted the top British spy agency GCHQ conclusion that “It lookslike the [US] agencies were asleep. They [the European agencies] were saying:‘There are contacts going on between people close to Mr. Trump and people webelieve are Russian intelligence agents. You should be wary of this.”60[Notes.html#C14F60] The sluggish FBI reaction hampered President Obama,reluctant to publicize the Russian intervention without hard facts during theelection campaign. In fact, while the CIA had decided in August 2016 that theKremlin was aiding candidate Trump, the undermanned FBI demurred for months.American voters were left in the dark about the de facto Russian–Trumpcollaboration deplored by Kagan and others.61 [Notes.html#C14F61]The Russian intervention included hacking of personal email accounts, websites,and at least twenty-one state election systems on behalf of candidate Trump,along with Russian propaganda being disseminated through thousands of ads andwebsites. Facebook hosted huge numbers of fake Russian accounts like themythical Melvin Redick whose postings directed gullible Americans toanti-Clinton sites such as the Kremlin’s DCLeaks.At the center of Kremlin propaganda was the Russian Internet Research Agency.Its accounts generated Russian postings and advertisements viewed by 10 millionAmericans on Facebook alone—some bought with rubles. The surreptitious,incendiary posts featured divisive issues designed to generate anger andelectoral enthusiasm among American conservatives, especially in swing states.[images/star.jpg]The moderate center of American democracy can prosper only when supported bywhat Madison termed “the power that knowledge gives”—a common body of widelyaccepted facts forming a foundation for reasoned public debate. 62[Notes.html#C14F62] The next chapter reviews options for rebuilding that centerby hewing to originalism in reducing the reach and impact of fake news.[images/line.jpg]* [Chapter14.html#rC14a]Pushing a partisan agenda can also be costly. The WallStreet Journal, for example, reported that the National Enquirer paid $150,000to purchase exclusive rights to information about a woman’s affair with DonaldTrump, a report they promptly buried, squelched. (In contrast, on November 5,2016, on the eve of the election, the Enquirer revealed to readers thatSecretary Clinton was addicted to narcotics.) See Margaret Sullivan, “EnquirerSticks a Fork in Rancid Campaign Journalism,” Washington Post, November 6, 2016."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 15 [Contents.html#CH015][images/common.jpg]Closing the “Hate Factories”: Avoiding the Farce Feared by Madison[Contents.html#CH015a]Facebook: “The Hate Factory.”1 [Notes.html#C15F01]—Jan Fleischhauer, Der Spiegel, October 2016What they’re doing [the POPS, or privately owned public spaces] is introducingall of these bad sites into our ecosystem and not having the means to monitorthem appropriately and effectively.2 [Notes.html#C15F02]—Marc Goldberg, Trust Metrics, December 2016Providers have used the social media like a newspaper or a radio station todisseminate their opinions and messages—without being subject to the provisionsof the general press law. They should change quickly . . . Facebook should belike a publishing house.3 [Notes.html#C15F03]—German Christian Democrats party chairman Ruprecht Polenz, December 2016MORE SO THAN IN any year in American history, 2016 brought to realization theframers’ fear that voters would be misled by innuendo, half-truths, andcharacter assassination conducted by an unsympathetic foreign power. InFederalist 68, Alexander Hamilton explicitly and forcefully warned of eventsthat eerily unfolded in 2016, where the presidential contest was possiblydetermined by “cabal, intrigue, and corruption . . . chiefly from the desire inforeign powers to gain an improper ascendant in our councils. How could theybetter gratify this, than by raising a creature of their own to the chiefmagistracy of the union?”4 [Notes.html#C15F04]Hamilton’s fear of an electorate duped by nefarious foreign powers was just oneelement of the framers’ pervasive fears of misinformed citizens. In rather sharpcontrast with original intent, the GOP’s operational manifesto is garnerpolitical power by appealing to voters with an afactual alternative narrativecentered on fake news. That strategy includes demonizing the fact-basedinformation industry central to the framers’ vision of a democracy sustained byan informed electorate.The GOP manifesto rejects fact, truth, and political collaboration as pillars ofAmerican democracy. It is diametrically in opposition to the Constitution andoriginal intent. Their manifesto has created a new era featuring an Americanelectorate increasingly exemplifying what the framers feared.Historians should look back with nostalgia at the relatively containedenvironment—comprised mostly of print and broadcast media—in which George Orwelland Alexander Solzhenitsyn labored to dissect and debunk the authoritarians’fake news of the 1930s and 1950s. Today’s social media is a new and dangerousaddition to the misinformation industry they confronted. More than 100 millionAmericans visit Facebook alone daily, far more than read newspapers andcomparable to TV as an information source.5 [Notes.html#C15F05]The “Hate Factories”With content filtration meek, the social media platforms or POPS have becomepopulated by not only you and your neighbors, but also by partisans, Kremlinpropagandists, terrorist recruiters, white supremacists, psychopaths, and othertraffickers seeking political gain, revenge, or to demean US democracy. Twentyyears ago they could only stand on a street corner and shout (unless owning amedia property). Today they can broadcast to billions from their living rooms.Malicious and mendacious postings are a minority on social media but plentifulenough for Facebook to be labeled the “hate factory.”6 [Notes.html#C15F06] Thelack of qualitative content censorship or filtration by the POPS has enabledthis minority to expose democracies to the same dysfunction, antagonism, anddisruption that followed the aggressive exploitation of the previous sensationalnew media innovation—radio—by European and Soviet authoritarians in the 1930s.The POPS have been slow in addressing even pathological content on theirplatforms, with fake news, killings, revenge porn, animal abuse, and the likeroutinely going viral within moments of posting. Twitter for a time permittedthen-Breitbart editor Milo Yiannopoulos and pharmaceutical entrepreneur MartinShkreli to harass online (respectively) an actress and an investigativereporter, including doctored photos.7 [Notes.html#C15F07] And, it permitsphysical assaults on customers by online sociopaths deploying flashing animationto precipitate epileptic seizures among the vulnerable—attacks that Americanpolice too rarely investigate.8 [Notes.html#C15F08] Indeed, Twitter is anespecially accommodating platform for psychopaths or partisans, easilyaccommodating anonymity. Moreover, its technical architecture is unusuallyvulnerable, enabling entrepreneurs to create hundreds of automated accounts orbots, propagating similar themes, striving to land on Twitter’s “TrendingTopics.” Such coordination generates a Potemkin front of nonexistent personsproviding puppet masters with a cyberspace sound truck. Samuel Woolley of OxfordUniversity’s Computational Propaganda Project explains: “Bots allow groups tospeak much more loudly . . . to use Twitter as a megaphone . . . manufacturingconsensus, or building the illusion of popularity for a candidate or aparticular idea.”9 [Notes.html#C15F09] This practice is hugely popular becausepractitioners (and researchers) have discovered that viewers have greatdifficulty distinguishing bots from humans. Recall Oxford researchers concludedthat about 20 percent of all political conversation they analyzed on Twitter in2016 was merely bots.10 [Notes.html#C15F10]Twitter’s efforts to strip terrorists and the like from its platform and rein inbots have been meek. In January 2017, angry relatives of the three Americanskilled by ISIS (Islamic State of Iraq and Syria) attacks in Belgium and Francesued Twitter for failing to delete members of the terrorist organization fromits platform. The suit alleged that Twitter played “a uniquely essential role inthe development of ISIS’s image, its success in recruiting members from aroundthe world, and its ability to carry out attacks and intimidate its enemies.”11[Notes.html#C15F11] ISIS cyber experts continued to use Twitter to plan anddirect attacks abroad in 2017.12 [Notes.html#C15F12] Even more accommodating isTelegram, originally developed by Russian libertarians. Its military gradeencryption and secret chat rooms have proven ideal for global communications byIslamic State terrorists who laud its features and encourage followers to useit.13 [Notes.html#C15F13] Other POPS that have proven reluctant to censorneo-Nazis and the like are PayPal, GoFundMe, Patreon, and GoDaddy, facilitatorsof the racial confrontations in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017.14[Notes.html#C15F14]Facebook’s track record is also discouraging. It failed to alert authorities in2014 of information that could have prevented the murder by Islamist terroristsof British soldier Lee Rigby.15 [Notes.html#C15F15] A suicide and murders inMinnesota, Virginia, and Cleveland have been streamed; and police in Uppsala,Sweden, during January 2017 investigated the streaming of a sexual assault.16[Notes.html#C15F16] Indeed, Facebook quite possibly influenced the presidentialvote in 2016 by refusing to ban fake news postings; intimidated by conservativesin the month before the election, it actually fired its team of contentmonitors.17 [Notes.html#C15F17] The Russian military meanwhile utilized Facebookmarketing to craft pro-Trump and racist messaging. Posing as Americans, it fedpropaganda hundreds of millions or billions of times to targeted voters beforethe election on Twitter, Facebook, and other POPS. Facebook on occasion has alsomocked and intimidated critics of its permissiveness. BBC investigatorsuncovered Facebook postings involving child abuse in March 2017, for instance.After demanding the BBC investigators send it copies of the postings, Facebookofficials refused to take them down, and instead played “gotcha”—reporting theinvestigators to the police.18 [Notes.html#C15F18]Voluntary Self-Regulation FailedThe POPS business model calls for maximizing user clicks by too readilydismissing ethical standards, journalistic safeguards, and a moral obligation topresent the truth, censor hate speech, or (for PayPal and the like) deny fundingfor hate groups. Facebook has come to partner with fact-checkers to investigatecomplaints of offensive and bogus postings, deleting some or attaching alerts.And it does proactively veto some offensive postings including nudity. But likeother POPS, user complaints about offensive postings or images are mostlyaddressed belatedly after they have already gone viral. Moreover, its filtrationsystem has been slow to mobilize. Facebook officials in Germany concluded, forinstance, that anonymous online threats by one or more sociopaths to attack afemale actor’s face with a chain saw “had not violated our communitystandards.”19 [Notes.html#C15F19] They refused to delete postings urging thatwar refugees be sent to gas chambers or that readers “pour petrol over them[Syrian refugees] and set them on fire.” In each instance, Facebook respondedthat complaints about these posts “lack merit,” and that its refusal to deletethem was “no violation of German law by Facebook or its employees.”20[Notes.html#C15F20] This business model shields psychopaths, Kremlin propaganda,and fake news from the sort of explicit content accountability that printjournalists or broadcasters face under German law, where even printing maliciousletters to the editor can cause a publication to be closed.21[Notes.html#C15F21]Pushed by German officials, the POPS responded by agreeing in mid-2016 tovoluntary self-filtration of content. The results were underwhelming. During thefourth quarter of 2016, only 40 percent of flagged content was even reviewed bythe POPS within twenty-four hours, and only 28.3 percent of such content wasremoved.22 [Notes.html#C15F22] Overall, Facebook deleted less than one-half ofhate speech postings, despite the fact that German law obligates social mediaplatforms to promptly delete postings inciting violence or slandering anotherperson upon complaint.23 [Notes.html#C15F23] In contrast, the more responsibleYouTube platform removed 90 percent of objectionable content flagged by userswithin twenty-four hours.24 [Notes.html#C15F24]Justice Minister Heiko Maas summarized the experiment this way: “Too littleillegal content is being deleted and it’s not being deleted sufficientlyquickly. The biggest problem is and remains that the networks don’t take thecomplaints of their own users seriously enough.”25 [Notes.html#C15F25] Hisfrustration led to the German January 2018 Network Enforcement law that imposesfines of up to €50 million on larger social media platforms failing to deleteillegal or offensive speech, hate speech, or fake news within twenty-fourhours.26 [Notes.html#C15F26] The officials simply extended rules applicable toprint and broadcasters to social media platforms as well. Structuring thecensorship obligation in this manner mimics in some measure the successfulAmerican procedure under the Fairness Doctrine, although the German processremains reactive rather than ex-ante—a huge shortcoming.27 [Notes.html#C15F27]In France, it took similar severe pressure from officials fearing the impact offake news and Russian propaganda on voters in 2017 for the POPS to beginaggressive monitoring of French-language postings. Some fifteen POPS, includingFacebook and Google, eventually partnered with Le Monde in the CrossCheckinitiative.The situation is little better in America where cyber targets have redress onlythrough cumbersome and expensive libel laws or privacy statutes. The successfulsuit by billionaire Peter Thiel fronted by Terry Bollea (Hulk Hogan), involvingfake news disseminated by the website Gawker, consumed years, $10 million,hinged on a hometown jury, and defendants (owners of Gawker) who were Americansand thus reachable by US courts.28 [Notes.html#C15F28]Remediating the offensive content of the POPS is low on the agenda of the Trumpadministration. But American corporations including financial firms andStarbucks have increasingly become targets of cyberattacks. That has generatedinterest in corralling fake news that propagates globally at lightning speed(Costco no longer taking memberships; Xbox killed a teenager!). Some twelve ofSnopes’ top fifty fake news attacks were targeted at firms, reported theFinancial Times.29 [Notes.html#C15F29]Leading European governments have become more proactive, insistent that the EUrequire dramatically better content accountability from the POPS. GermanEconomic Minister Brigitte Zypries has called for laws against fake news andhate mongering, explaining that “soft” regulation “privatizes justice.”30[Notes.html#C15F30] Referring to “evil material,” Theresa May demanded inSeptember 2017 that “Industry needs to go further and faster . . . developingtechnological solutions which prevent it being uploaded in the first place.”This European pressure has forced the POPS to react more aggressively inevaluating questionable postings. New tools, algorithms, and thousands ofcensors have been added. The POPS have the technical and financial capability tocensor ex-ante all content.31 [Notes.html#C15F31] Thus far they have onlyselectively adopted ex-ante censorship, relying on algorithms that have proveneasily gamed and by-passed.Comprehensive content censorship is most likely to begin in Europe and withvideo content. Including YouTube, the POPS may perhaps soon be required to meetthe same rules applicable to broadcasters. Hate speech, fake news, incitement toterror, and the like could be required to be rejected ex-ante through revisionsto the audiovisual media services regulations.32 [Notes.html#C15F32]Expunging Fake News from All Media PlatformsThe pathological, fake and partisan news carried by the POPS has darkened thevisionary goals of entrepreneurs like Twitter cofounder Evan Williams to makethe world “a better place.” To realize that vision, governments must ceaseabdicating content filtration to market forces. Their challenge is no differentfrom confronting environmental polluters or drug dealers, who privatize profitswhile socializing the harmful costs of their practices and products. With socialmedia, that cost is measured in the loss of individual privacy and contentment,as well as diminution in the quality of information available to citizens andvoters. It is also measured in the steadily thinning newsrooms of the fact-basedmainstream media struggling with online competitors who themselves eschewexpensive investigative and watchdog reporting.The time-honored solution of economists in situations like this where marketforces underprice social costs is to raise that price with penalties or throughregulation on suppliers. Adopting a nuanced and comprehensive approach drawingon that traditional economic principle is warranted to address the failures ofthe POPS market: • Educators and parents should address the issue of fake news inschools, around the kitchen table, and elsewhere. For example, Bamse, thepopular Swedish children’s comic strip, has sought to teach youths todistinguish between fact and fake news, and to question all internet content.33[Notes.html#C15F33] • Mainstream media should continue to aggressively identify fake newsstories34 [Notes.html#C15F34] and nourish fact-checking initiatives patterned onLe Monde’s Decodex and the BBC’s RealityCheck. • The public sector should require that content on POPS platforms notbe poisonous, meet community standards, and be factual—ingredients central to ahigh quality democracy. That creates a bias toward ex-ante censorship. Policyadvocacy/political ads should be limited, ex-ante filtered, and held to the sameattribution standards as print and broadcast media, including identification offunders. Exceptions for individual political speech should be considered. • In democracies imposing limits on electioneering spending, politicalinformation and opinion disseminated on social media threaten to derail thepositive character of their political campaigns. Specific bans or limits onsocial media for all political speech in such countries are appropriate. Socialmedia should not become a loophole enabling corporate or independent entities toevade existing limits on political speech or issue advocacy during elections. • Automated bots should be eliminated from cyberspace, following thepattern set by political parties in Germany.35 [Notes.html#C15F35] • The POPS such as PayPal that process payments should also be requiredto delete users promoting hate speech or fake news. • All POPS should be required to obtain explicit user permission todisseminate their cyberspace data.The German government is perhaps most advanced in this direction, aided by itsexisting thorough press law that lays out responsibilities and rights forinformation disseminators. Handelsblatt journalist Dietmar Neuerer explains thefundamental principle being promulgated is that derogatory information andopinion on social media is violative of the nation’s free speech guarantee: “Noone is entitled to freedom of expression, to violate the rights of others, forexample, by inciting them to violence, or to slander them. These laws apply—theymust be applied more consistently in social networks than before.”36[Notes.html#C15F36]Justice Minister Maas agrees: “The providers of social networks are responsiblewhen their platforms are misused to spread hate crime or illegal false news.”37[Notes.html#C15F37] Tabea Rößner, a leading Green Party official, explainedtheir logic: “Social platforms were initially not press companies with editorialresponsibility, [but have become a] crucial part of the opinion-formingprocess.” The Christian Democratic Party’s parliamentary chairman RuprechtPolenz concurs: “Providers have used the social media like a newspaper or aradio station to disseminate their opinions and messages—without being subjectto the provisions of the general press law. That should change quickly . . .Facebook should be like a publishing house.”38 [Notes.html#C15F38][images/star.jpg]American internet experts agree in some measure. Wired journalist Emma GreyEllis concluded in April 2017, for instance, that “The only way to kill revengeporn is to stop it being posted in the first place.”39 [Notes.html#C15F39]POPS’s censorship of social media communications may offend many Americans, butit will not run afoul of their First Amendment rights shielding nearly allspeech content. That right entitles one to opine on street corners and precludesthe government from censoring your commentary on any media, including socialmedia. But the media platforms themselves can legally act as censors in Americaand in Europe, as explained by law professors Margot Kaminski of Ohio State andKate Klonick of Yale Law School.40 [Notes.html#C15F40] Indeed, media platformsare routinely sued for not adequately censoring offending content. Mediaproprietors including the POPS are obligated neither to lend you megaphones norto publish or otherwise broadcast your musings or opinion. Referring to mediaorganizations, Kyle Pope, editor and publisher of the Columbia JournalismReview, explained, “It’s totally within their rights to set ground rules,” andto set standards in choosing what advertisements and news they air or publish.41[Notes.html#C15F41]As an industry, the POPS differ only technologically from print or broadcastmedia platforms, and their content should be subject to ex-ante or ex-postreview as appropriate. The original justification for the Fairness Doctrinerequirement for broadcast censorship was the US role in fostering broadcastingtechnology. And the same compelling logic applies to cyberspace disseminators aswell. Moreover, adoption of a filtration regime would align the POPS with commonpractice in many areas of American governance and society. Protocols andprocedures to ensure dissemination of nonpartisan, fact-based information arecommon in the fields of national security, transportation, medicine, food andequipment safety, and a host of other applications that involve scientificinvestigation and development. They are intended to ensure that security andintelligence officials, judges, medical researchers, clinicians, pesticidesafety investigators, transportation managers, environmental engineers,legislators, NASA engineers, and public officials are exposed to the wisdomderived from evidence-based, unbiased, and nonpartisan information. Voters, theultimate stakeholders and arbiters of American governance, are entitled to noless.Proactive censorship of cyberspace is controversial but will not disrupt thevast bulk of interpersonal communications. Indeed, POPS like Facebook and Googlemay seek to rebuild reputational damage in seizing the competitive advantageoffered by providing users a credible platform rather than a grimy scrum.Content censorship is justified by the existential risks noted by Madison andothers that are posed to democracy by a misinformed citizenry. The challenge isto find their aspirational information sweet spot—that universe where mostlyfactual information is enjoyed by citizens practicing free speech—free ofdistortion, free of self-serving filtration by government, and free of slander,hate speech, and fake news.Admittedly, it is uncertain how technically comprehensive a regime to censorsocial media can be. Delistings by Facebook, PayPal, GoDaddy, Google, and otherssent white supremacist websites scurrying to platforms such as Gab.ai, Hatrone,and WeSearchr during the latter half of 2017.42 [Notes.html#C15F42] Desperate toremain accessible, the Daily Stormer, for instance, shifted to Tor (a browserfor anonymous web surfing), then to a Russian server, then to CloudFlare fromwhich it was also soon booted.43 [Notes.html#C15F43] Flitting through the darkweb certainly limits accessibility, which is important. Yet it will take thecooperation of state actors like Russia to achieve an effective cyber censorshipregime, not to mention support by the Republican Party. Judging by behaviors in2016, it seems evident that neither is inclined to see fake news and the likestripped from cyberspace. Quite the contrary.The Dangers of Loopholes in Content Accuracy StandardsIdeally, content standards should apply impartially across all media platforms.Britain offers an example of the consequences of standards that are notcomprehensively applied. It insists on a “due impartiality” standard forbroadcasters but not for newspapers or social media.44 [Notes.html#C15F44] Thatprint loophole has been exploited by the fittest, including Rupert Murdoch. As anewspaper proprietor, he enjoys a judicially affirmed right (as in Australia andAmerica) to discredit the disfavored and skew public opinion as much as hiswallet and conscience allow. In one instance, Murdoch placed a large picture incolor of political opponent Kevin Rudd professionally photoshopped in a Naziuniform on the front page above the fold of Australia’s most widely readnewspaper weeks before an election.45 [Notes.html#C15F45]Such antics provide an important lesson. If any loophole is permitted, theoutcome will mimic experience in Britain, with consequences all too familiar toAmericans: “The type of opinionated and polarized news that is now a feature inUS television and radio has for years been found in the UK print media,”explained Jacob Rowbottom in the New Republic:If “special interests” are often cast as the villains of US politics, mediaproprietors play an equivalent role in the UK. In the US, candidates, parties,and special interest groups spend huge sums of money to gain an advantage in thead wars. By contrast, the most vicious political messages in the UK tend to befound in the pages of the tabloid newspapers . . . The newspapers . . . are theonly outlet that can engage in electoral advocacy without restraint from eitherspending controls or content regulation. As a result, whoever controls thenewspapers has a much greater capacity to steer the course of an electiondebate. Given the relatively small number of titles with a national audience andlevels of concentration, this influence lies in the hands of a small number ofcompanies. News Corporation alone has over a third of the market share fornational newspapers. This explains why so many politicians went out of their wayto win the favour of Rupert Murdoch and his lieutenants.46 [Notes.html#C15F46]This predicament highlights the challenge of integrating political and policyadvocacy carried on social media with any system of limits on electioneering andbroadcast spending. Laws in higher quality democracies that limit campaignspending do not address social media advertising or communications as a rule.Thus, regulators in these countries face new challenges in crafting limits onthe volume of political communications by any individual or organization oversocial media.47 [Notes.html#C15F47]A further challenge is posed by the emerging practices labeled psychometricsnoted earlier, designed to sway voters using data surreptitiously seized fromcyberspace. Russia, US politicians, and the Mercers garner data revealed bycyber interactions, what would seem to be an abuse of privacy by the POPS.Facebook for example, refused to sell most user information until 2012. Today,personal and credit card interactions are just another industry revenue stream,widely marketed without user permission. As exploited during the Brexit vote,noted earlier, this prized personal data enabled partisans to classifyindividual voters by their pet peeves and preferences. That is how some 600,000targeted Brits came to be bombarded by a billion individualized, misleading, oreven mendacious appeals.48 [Notes.html#C15F48]The POPS should voluntarily end this abuse of privacy, ceasing to compile ormarket data on users. Lacking an effective response, the democracies should banthis invasive exploitation of social media users. This reform will need to beled by the higher quality democracies such as Germany, because the Trumpadministration is opposed. Soon after taking office, it torpedoed an Obamaadministration regulation requiring internet providers to obtain customerpermission before tracking and commercializing their online habits.Fact-Based Reporting Should Be Complemented with High-Quality ReportingAnother concern is the erosion of fact-based reporting as resources atmainstream media enterprises are drawn away by social media. Quality factualreporting is thriving in a few fact-based media organizations like the New YorkTimes and Washington Post, which have successfully adapted to the cyberrevolution. But, they are the exception. An example is the American Center forPublic Integrity, including its branch the International Consortium ofInvestigative Journalists (ICIJ). Although they are the source of numerousexposés including the Panama Papers, which has reduced the use of internationaltax havens, they lack an adequate financial base.49 [Notes.html#C15F49] Despitetheir fundamental value to societies, the same challenge exists for otherinvestigators such as ProPublica or the Marshall Project’s work on criminaljustice.Ideally, a regime requiring more socially responsible behavior by the POPSshould include social media platforms directing resources to the expansion ofwhat Richard Hasen terms the “checking” activity—fact-checking and unveiling thetruth while holding dissemblers accountable.50 [Notes.html#C15F50] That seminalobligation of mainstream journalism has inspired remarkable reporting on manyoccasions, including Karl Fleming and Claude Sitton reporting oninstitutionalized abuse and homicide during Jim Crow; Edward R. Murrow reportingon the demagogic Joseph McCarthy; or Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein onWatergate. Such truth-telling requires an idealized “significant set of skillsand traditions” explains University of Alabama law professor, Paul Horowitz:“Before a story is published, every line, every quote, every judgment call issubjected to checking and re-checking, debate and counter-debate, andinstitutional second guessing.”51 [Notes.html#C15F51] University of Chicagoeconomist Luigi Zingales has argued that such an aggressive independentmedia—professional, objective, and free of bias—is vital in limiting abuse andcorruption by government and powerful interests.52 [Notes.html#C15F52]The private and nonprofit sectors are actively searching for business modelsthat support the preservation of objective journalism. And they are seekinginnovative new ways to collaborate with social media platforms that increasinglydominate news dissemination. One successful if ad hoc approach has been forcitizens to directly support online independent, investigative journalism,exemplified by the French venture Mediapart or by Philadelphia’s H.F. Lenfest’ssupport of The Inquirer, The Daily News, and Philly.com [http://Philly.com].Another example is eBay founder Pierre Omidyar, who donated $100 million in 2017to support a number of independent investigative entities, including $4.5million to the ICIJ. George Soros has also donated to efforts resisting fakenews. And Wikipedia’s founder Jimmy Wales is raising capital for a new globalnews organization called Wikitribune to expose fake news.53 [Notes.html#C15F53]These efforts to enhance fact-based reporting and the checking function can bedramatically accelerated if the POPS themselves begin in-house investigativereporting. The more widespread the watchdog or checking activity on all Americanmedia platforms, including the POPS, the closer the nation will come torealizing the framers’ intent for an informed electorate.Restoring the Quality of American DemocracyA global retreat from democracy is well underway, with nations such as Hungary,Mozambique, Poland, and Turkey growing more authoritarian of late. Indeed, 2016was the eleventh year in a row that the Freedom House matrix noted earlierdocumented that the reach of global democracy has diminished. This certainlyreflects in some measure America’s retreat from global leadership beginning withthe humiliating 2000 election and the Iraq war of choice. That retreat isreflected in the Freedom House’s rather dismal ranking of thirty-second place in2016 for American democracy, as noted in chapter 8 [Chapter08.html]. It removedAmerica from the top rank of democracies due to “the cumulative impact of flawsin the [US] electoral system, a disturbing increase in the role of private moneyin election campaigns, and the legislative process, legislative gridlock . ..”54 [Notes.html#C15F54]The last chapter provides recommendations to remediate these deficiencies. Theyare the steps needed to raise the quality of American democracy, enabling thenation to join the ranks of peer wealthy nations in prioritizing the prosperityof all its citizens."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 16 [Contents.html#CH016][images/common.jpg]Epilogue [Contents.html#CH016a]If we must be governed by those whom the billionaires choose to fund, then thesocial contract really has been ruptured.1 [Notes.html#C16F01]—Charles Fried, Reagan administration solicitor general, April 2014THE LAST MILLENNIUM OF political thought, revolution, and evolution has produceda handful of wealthy societies that have managed to derail capitalism’s defaultsetting of plutocratic rule. Many have crafted high-quality Aristoteliandemocracies where individual political rights are respected and equal to allothers: Not the United States.Many feature expansive voting rights and proportional representation where everyvote is meaningful: Not the United States.Many feature voter sovereignty where policy outcomes reflect majoritarianpreferences clearly heard and readily heeded by lawmakers: Not the UnitedStates.Many are responsive to middle-class aspirations for steadily rising prosperity.Just as Adam Smith dared hope in 1776 in An Inquiry into the Nature and Causesof the Wealth of Nations, they have harnessed the wondrous mechanism ofcapitalism to widely broadcast the gains of growth: Not the United States.Many moderate passions in the pursuit of the common good, rejecting tribalism:Not the United States.Today, the low quality of America’s democracy is primarily a consequence oftransitory majorities of conservative justices on the Supreme Court beginningwith Buckley v. Valeo in 1976. For partisan gain, they have rejected originalismin the key area of political corruption—epitomized by the Roberts Court’sMcCutcheon v. FEC (2014) decision, in which the majority concluded thatpolitical donations to purchase “ingratiation and access . . . is a centralfeature of democracy.” Thus, they have proudly made industrial-scale vote buyingand the ensuing cynicism and tribalism the central features of Americandemocracy.The Buckley era has empowered the fittest fifty to move the nation backward,toward the default setting of capitalism. Average Americans are now firmly inthe grip of Piketty’s endless inegalitarian spiral. The consequence, accordingto Brookings Institution researchers, is that a majority have come to believethat the American dream is dead, that “hard work and determination are noguarantee of success.”2 [Notes.html#C16F02] Their grim prognosis will not soonor easily be lifted, notes Robin Wigglesworth, US Markets Editor of theFinancial Times: “In the long term it is not inconceivable that the politicallandscape shifts away from corporate interests and the US re-embraces the“trust-busting” zeal of Teddy Roosevelt. But it certainly looks a distantprospect today.”3 [Notes.html#C16F03]Improving Political Equality Begins with the Supreme CourtEnding the spiral to resuscitate the American dream begins with the SupremeCourt, where all issues involving pay-to-play and political equality fall withinits purview. Its powers under judicial review are a settled matter. That meansthe corruption of pay-to-play is more amenable to remediation over time, forexample, than the slaveocracy that confronted Abraham Lincoln in 1861. True, theantimajoritarian US electoral and governance architectures pose the samebarriers to political equality today as in the spring of 1861. But judicialreview offers a lifeline to future reformers that was unavailable to Lincolnbecause the Constitution unquestionably embraced slavery. In contrast, both thefounding fathers and the framers’ original intent unquestionably was to deny aconstitutional shield to the political corruption inherent with pay-to-play.Raising the quality of American democracy hinges on more than endingpay-to-play. While meaningfully amending the Constitution is problematic, theSupreme Court can unilaterally implement needed seminal reforms enhancingpolitical equality. Indeed, other democracies have rather routinely improved thequality of their governance by revamping antiquated practices, including nationssuch as the UK, whose democracy predates the US. To elevate individual politicalrights so that citizens are fairly heard and heeded, for instance, upgrades byhigher quality democracies have featured adoption of unicameral legislativesystems to render irrelevant malapportioned legislative bodies like the USSenate. Moreover, the upgrades have facilitated adoption of proportionalrepresentation electoral systems, which in the process eliminated the severelyantidemocratic phenomenon of wasted votes caused by single-member legislativedistricts, inevitably gerrymandered. And many have eliminated winner-take-all(plurality) electoral systems in favor of binary runoff structures. Thesereforms were adopted precisely to avoid American-style outcomes wheremajoritarian opinion is degraded and popular vote losers leapfrog over winnersto become national leaders, sometimes by judicial edict, as in banana republics.These upgrades abroad have ensured that public authority to act and theconsequences for such acts are clear to voters, avoiding an American-stylemiasma of diffused political accountability. The complexity and tangledauthority forced by the US Constitution guarantees opaqueness in an age whenhigher quality democracies emphasize transparency.A Supreme Court Agenda to Build a Higher Quality DemocracyAn aspirational agenda for a visionary Supreme Court beyond ending pay-to-playincludes the following items:Supreme Court AppointmentLife tenure populates the Court with justices whose formative years, education,and career experiences often leaves them quite far removed from their legalcontemporaries or society. Term-limiting Supreme Court justices is the bestremedy. Another upgrade would require legislative supermajority confirmation ofall judicial appointments, including the Supreme Court. Over some years, thatstep would populate the American judiciary with less strident or partisanjustices. In contrast, the conservative Justice Gorsuch was confirmed in 2017 bya bare majority of senators representing a minority of Americans. At a minimum,justices of the Supreme Court should adopt the same ethical code of conductapplicable to all other federal judges. It should become de rigeur to placeassets in blind trusts. And recusal should be triggered in cases involvingfamilial or commercial connections or cases involving interests with whomjustices interact meaningfully.The Campaign Finance SystemRecriminalizing vote buying will require complementary reforms to the Americancampaign finance system, drawn from the spending limits and electioneeringfunding practices of higher quality democracies.Voting RightsEnding the income bias should incentivize voter participation. That can beencouraged with steps to expand voting rights by reversing rulings of theRoberts Republicans, including Crawford and Shelby County, which disenfranchisedmillions of citizens.The SenateArticle V of the Constitution poses a formidable barrier to democratizing theSenate. An option is to draw on Australian law. Its Senate suffers irreparablyfrom American-style malapportionment (it has a US-style equalstate-representation structure), but Australians ameliorate its undemocraticfeature in this fashion: A relatively large number of senators (12) representeach state, importantly selected through a proportional representation electoralsystem. Australia also provides representation in the Senate for its nationalcapital, Canberra.Electoral CollegeThe antidemocratic Electoral College should be neutered, its members voting onlyfor the winner of the national presidential popular vote. This reform is beingimplemented by the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, encouraging statesto enact statutes pledging to cast their electoral votes for the popular votewinner.4 [Notes.html#C16F04] Such action by states with at least 270 electoralvotes would de facto eliminate the Electoral College, although state statutescan always be repealed at a later date.Reforming State and Local Judicial SystemsAll state and local judicial appointments should be based on merit, appointed bysupermajority votes of legislators. The Supreme Court should insist thatjudgeships be professionalized, drawing on the potent mechanism in higherquality democracies: The judiciary is a formal, professional career track,featuring educational thresholds and periodic evaluations. For example France’srigorous training to become a judge is open only to lawyers and laststwenty-seven months. Only 5 percent of aspirants become judges. Cornellinternational law professor, Mitchel Lasser, explains that judges abroad “havespent years in school taking practical and theoretical courses on how to be ajudge. They are professionals. The rest of the world is stunned and amazed atwhat we do, and vaguely aghast that our state judges can rise to their positionsthrough elections rather than highly specialized, demanding training.”5[Notes.html#C16F05] Additionally, judicial recusal from cases involving familialor commercial connections should be mandated, as should the use of blind trustsfor all state and local judges.Reforming State and Local Electoral SystemsWith a federal government dominated by the GOP at the moment, steps towardpolitical equality can only be taken at state and local levels. The BrennanCenter estimates that five million eligible voters are affected by voter ID lawsand the like, their votes potentially lost to partisan disenfranchisement.6[Notes.html#C16F06] Yet, that figure is dwarfed by the sixty million or soAmericans whose votes were wasted in 2016, cast for losers in single memberlegislative districts. Their preferences are ignored, the voters unrepresentedbecause of the undemocratic American electoral structure. In contrast, allvoters’ voices are heard in higher quality democracies abroad through their PRelectoral systems. The Supreme Court should mandate PR for all Americanlegislative elections.Another reform is binary runoff elections (or the increasingly popularranked-choice mechanism) in instances involving a single office, such as mayoror governor. States can also abolish gerrymandering on their own initiative byadopting independent entities to design legislative districts; it is possiblethat the Supreme Court’s Gill v. Whitford ruling, due in 2018, could evenmandate that states minimize gerrymandering. And they can upgrade by adopting afurther handful of reforms, including open primaries (as in Louisiana,Washington state, and California), election day registration, and automaticvoter registration of applicants for drivers’ licenses, as in Oregon,California, West Virginia, and Vermont; that innovation tripled newregistrations in Oregon (nine other states and the District of Columbia haveapproved the reform). Finally, states and communities can draw on experience inConnecticut, Maine, New York City, and the like and adopt electioneeringspending caps complemented by public funding of elections.Fact-Based MediaIn today’s media market, factual information struggles to compete with alluringand flamboyant fake news, with more Americans consequently coming to distrustthan trust mainstream media. The seminal responsibility of media as sources offactual information for voters distinguishes them as a class uniquely valuableto democracy. There are three steps appropriate to restore the centrality soughtby James Madison of nonpartisan, fact-based information to American democracy.First, the Fairness Doctrine should be resurrected, applicable to bothbroadcasters and the POPS, each media form the product of public investment.Proprietors in both media industries should be held accountable for meetingcommunity standards, for the accuracy of the information they disseminate, andfor reflecting the doctrine in their presentation of political and policyissues. That means fake news, abusive content, hate speech, violent content, andcontent that fails community standards should be denied access to the publicspace provided by broadcasters and the POPS. Nor should online paymentproprietors permit access by entities that disseminate such content. While thesesteps would leave the vast bulk of information on the POPS unaffected,objectionable content would be denied the public space. Meeting required qualitystandards as truth-tellers would include broadcasters and the POPS evaluatingall content ex-ante, the veracity of material verified. The success of theFairness Doctrine teaches the powerful lesson that dissemination of factualinformation sustained by content filtration does not equate to Orwelliancensorship.Second, social media should end collection of personal information from userswithout explicit and clear permission.Third, the POPS should support investigative journalism and ideally initiatetheir own factual reporting.Upgrading American DemocracyThe goal of these reforms is to upgrade the quality of American democracy byeasing the political grip of the fittest fifty. They view the US economy as azero-sum game where the gain of others in the form of higher wages, forinstance, is only achieved at their expense. Adam Smith recognized this syndromein 1776, noting that “masters [employers] are always and everywhere in a sort oftacit, but constant and uniform combination, not to raise the wages of labor. .. .”7 [Notes.html#C16F07] Many have proven unwilling to support the sameopportunities for others that America availed them. Most are market literalists,yet ignore the tapestry woven by Adam Smith, who insisted that capitalismflourishes best when featuring regulation encouraging responsible businessstewardship and citizenship. The fittest fifty reject the seminal role envisagedby Smith and the higher quality democracies for the business community asguarantors of a broadly based prosperity.America confronts formidable structural challenges to productivity and growth,as explored by economists such as Northwestern University professor Robert J.Gordon.8 [Notes.html#C16F08] Those challenges are rendered forbidding byopposition from the fittest fifty and their GOP acolytes to higher wages and tothe types of public investment that have been instrumental to growth in the pastlike education and R&D. They view demands for higher wages, an end to offshoringof high-wage jobs, closing foreign tax havens, and meeting government safety,health, labor, and environmental standards as impositions. Fierce opposition totaxes by the GOP on behalf of the fittest fifty, for example, is the reasonAmerican families confront the highest out-of-pocket child care costs of anywealthy democracy. According to the OECD, Americans spend 28 percent of netfamily incomes for toddler child care—nearly double the share in Australia andtriple the 9 percent share in France or Germany.9 [Notes.html#C16F09]Embracing the fittest fifty agenda has seen the Republican Party forsakepolitical moderation. Their extreme tactics in pursuit of this agenda haveemptied the American political center, diminishing the ballast provided by abroad moderate core of swing voters. The virtues of prudence, acknowledgedlimits, invective-free debate, balancing competing principles, openness to newfacts, and respect for opponents have become scarce in American politics. Publicpolicy devised by facts-driven debate, dialogue, compromise, and the crowningvirtue of majoritarian opinion fairly heard and heeded have been subsumed byintemperance and a Machiavellian pursuit of political gain.Pay-to-play and the ensuing polarization has made American democracy the farcefeared by James Madison. The US government now resembles that of India, as notedby Tom Colebatch in the Sydney Morning Herald: “Look at the United States, andIndia, where partisan politics has ruled out any serious attempt to reform eventhe most obvious problems.”10 [Notes.html#C16F10]This Australian columnist is one in a chorus of foreign observers perceivingAmerica as a nation in decline. With middle-class economic opportunity erodingand politics bedeviled by pay-to-play, American exceptionalism has faded apacewith its shrinking middle class. Vote buying, economic immobility, stagnantwages, and the loss of a moderate, fact-based political center mock thatpretension. Here is an assessment by Spiegel journalists: “[It] has reached apoint in its history when the obvious can no longer be denied: The reality oflife in America so greatly contradicts the claim—albeit one that has always beenexaggerated—to be the ‘greatest nation on earth,’ that even the most ardentpatriots must be overcome with doubt.”11 [Notes.html#C16F11] And these commentswere written before the 2016 election.The only preceding period in American history of such political division was theantebellum era, when slave owners insisted that their constitutional rights berespected. Then as now, America lacked a visionary Supreme Court. The issues maybe different—today plutocrats seek economic gain by lowering the quality ofdemocracy rather than economic gain by perpetuating slavery. But the outcome isthe same. Political and economic equality are suppressed, democracy demeaned.Here is how neoconservative Robert Kagan explains the consequence of Republicanspursuing the fittest fifty agenda: “The Party’s wild obstructionism—the repeatedthreats to shut down the government . . . the insistence that compromise wasbetrayal . . . taught Republican voters that government, institutions, politicaltraditions, party leadership and parties themselves were things to beoverthrown, evaded, ignored, insulted, laughed at.”12 [Notes.html#C16F12]Charles Darwin would recognize the pathology immediately. In the Descent of Man,he described the disadvantage of such tribal division: “An advancement in thestandard of morality will certainly give an immense advantage to one tribe overanother. A tribe including many members who, from possessing in a high degreethe spirit of patriotism, fidelity, obedience, courage and sympathy, were alwaysready to aid one another, and to sacrifice themselves for the common good, wouldbe victorious over most other tribes . . .”13 [Notes.html#C16F13]Higher quality democracies abroad are characterized by unity of purpose,compromise, and collaboration. Their communitarian comity yields moreadvantageous societies that better fulfill the potential for citizens to meettheir aspirations and achieve happiness. High-quality democracies are ballastedby large centers of moderate voters. They flourish because governance is focusedon the greater good. Voter aspirations for tranquility and widespread prosperitycombine with political equality to translate into government policy. Theircitizens are able to overcome a natural distrust of others and actualize themoral sentiments in mankind’s better angels. That is how these democracies areable to perform on a higher plane than America and suppress the darker aspectsof mankind’s nature and of capitalism. It is how they succeed where Americafails in sustaining societies that realize the greatest good for the greatestnumber.Turnover on the Supreme Court will eventually put that desideratum in reach ofAmerica. Recriminalization of vote buying in particular will begin the processof replacing a pathology that Harvard biology professor E.O. Wilson terms“individual selection” with a society featuring empathy and shared mutual aid.14[Notes.html#C16F14]Like the Warren Court’s support of civil rights, it will take courage for futureCourt majorities to subordinate the fittest to Aristotle’s landless. But indoing so, these giants will begin the process of rebuilding the moderate centerof American democracy and realizing the full promise of the founding fathers’remarkable preamble to the Declaration of Independence."},{"pageContent":"[images/common1.jpg] NOTES [Contents.html#NOTES] [images/common1.jpg]Introduction: Removing the Dead Hand of Pay-to-Play 1 [Introduction.html#rINTF01].
