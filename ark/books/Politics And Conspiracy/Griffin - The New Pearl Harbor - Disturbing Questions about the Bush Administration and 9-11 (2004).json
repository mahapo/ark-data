Hough, President , Union Theological Seminary in New York ACKNOWLEDGMENTS In writ ing this book, I received an enormous amount of help and support . The great est help came, of course, from the aut hors upon whose work I drew. Wit hout the work of Naf eez Ahmed and Paul Thompson, this book would not have even been begun, and wit hout the books by Thierry Meyssan and Michel Chossudovsky , it would have been far less complet e. And then there are all those report ers and researchers who have published relevant mat erial in newspapers and magazines, on television shows, or on the Web, some of whom were labouring away long bef ore Ahmed and Thompson began their work. To some of these report ers and researchers I am indebt ed only indirect ly, through their influence on my primary sources; to others, I am direct ly indebt ed. I have acknowledged the work of at least many of them in the not es. The attempt to discover the trut h about 9/11 and bring it to light has been a very cooperat ive ent erprise, one involving hundreds of intensely dedicat ed, most ly unpaid, invest igat ors. I have received help from many other people, including Tal Avit zur, John Cobb, Michael Diet rick, Hilal Elver, Richard Falk, Allison Jaqua, Gianluigi Gugliermet to, Colleen Kelly, John McMurt ry, Pat Pat terson, Rosemary Ruet her, Pamela Thompson, and Sarah Wright . I wish also to thank all those who took time to express in writ ing their support for this book. I am indebt ed to Richard Falk for reasons that go far beyond his gracious willingness to writ e the Foreword. It was through his influence that I first began working on global polit ical mat ters. He has been my main discussion part ner about these mat ters. And it was through him that I became connect ed wit h Olive Branch Press of Interlink Publishing. I am especially grat eful for this connect ion. The two people wit h whom I have worked at Olive Branch — Pamela Thompson and Michel Moushabeck — have not only been delight ful collaborat ors. They have also manif est ed the kind of commit ment to this book that aut hors usually only dream about . I am appreciat ive of my inst itution, the Claremont School of Theology, and especially its president , Philip Amerson, and its dean, Jack Fit zmier, for their unst inting support of academic freedom and their recognit ion of the need for the schools facult y to writ e about vital public issues of the day. Finally, I am, as usual, most indebt ed to the ongoing support from my wif e, Ann Jaqua. FOREWORD David Ray Grif fin has writ ten an ext raordinary book. If caref ully read wit h even just a 30 - percent open mind, it is almost cert ain to change the way we underst and the workings of const itutional democracy in the Unit ed States at the highest levels of government . As such, this is a dist urbing book, depict ing a prof ound crisis of polit ical legit imacy for the most powerf ul sovereign state in the hist ory of the world — a count ry, furt hermore, embarked on the first borderless war, wit h no markers of vict ory and def eat . If The New Pearl Harbor receives the sort of public and media attent ion that it abundant ly deserves, it should alter the general public debat e and exert a posit ive influence on how the future unf olds. It is rare, indeed, that a book has this pot ent ial to become a force of hist ory. What makes The New Pearl Harbor so special is that it explores the most sensit ive and cont roversial terrain — the broad landscape of official behavior in relat ion to the tragedy of 9/11 — in the best spirit of academic det achment , coupled wit h an exemplary display of the strongest scholarly virt ue: a willingness to allow inquiry to follow the pat h of evidence and reason wherever it leads. And it leads here to explosive dest inat ions, where severe doubt s are raised about the integrit y and worldview of our leadership in those part s of the government that exercise the great est cont rol over the behavior and dest iny of the count ry, part icularly in the area of nat ional"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"securit y, which includes a war overseas and the stifling of libert ies at home. Grif fin brilliant ly makes an overwhelming argument for a comprehensive, unhampered, fully funded, and suit ably prominent invest igat ion of the ent ire story of how and why 9/11 happened, as well as why such an unprecedent ed breakdown of nat ional securit y was not fully and immediat ely invest igat ed as a mat ter of the most urgent nat ional priorit y. There are so many gaping holes in the official account s of 9/11 that no plausible coherent narrat ive remains, and unt il now we have been staggering forward as if the trut h about these traumat ic event s no longer mat tered. Grif fin shows, wit h insight and a firm grasp of the many dimensions of the global securit y policy of the Bush Administ rat ion, that get ting 9/11 right , even belat edly, mat ters desperat ely. The layer upon layer of unexplained fact s, the mult iple effort s by those in power to foreclose independent inquiry, and the evidence of a pre -9/ 11 blueprint by Bush insiders to do exact ly what they are now doing on the basis of a 9/11 mandat e is why the Grif fin assessment does not even require a reader wit h a normally open mind. As suggest ed, 30 - percent recept ivit y will do, which means that all but the most dogrnat ically blinded adherent s of the Bush presidency should be convinced by the basic argument of this book. It must be underscored that this book does not belong in the genre of \"conspiracy theories, \" at least , as Grif fin himself point s out , in the pejorat ive sense in which that term is usually underst ood. It is a painst akingly scrupulous look at the evidence, wit h an account ing of the numerous discrepancies bet ween the official account provided by the US government and the best informat ion available. Of course, it is fair to wonder, if the conclusion toward which Grif fins evidence point s is correct , why this story -of -the -cent ury has not been clearly told bef ore in this count ry. Why have the media been asleep ? Why has Congress been so passive about fulfilling its role as a wat chdog branch of government , above all prot ect ive of the American people ? Why have there been no resignat ions from on high by principled public servant s followed by elect rifying revelat ions ? There have been quest ions raised here and there and allegat ions of official complicit y made almost from the day of the attacks, especially in Europe, but as far as I know, no American unt il Grif fin has had the pat ience, the fort itude, the courage, and the intelligence to put so many pieces toget her in a single coherent account . Part of the difficult y in achieving credibilit y in relat ion to issues this prof oundly dist urbing to public conf idence in the basic legit imacy of state power is that the accusat ory voices most often heard are strident and irresponsible, making them easily dismissed as \"paranoid\" or \"out rageous\" wit hout furt her considerat ion of whet her the concerns raised warrant invest igat ion. In cont rast , Grif fins approach is calm and his argument consist ent ly well -reasoned, making his analysis undeniably compelling. But there are troubling forces at work that block our access to the trut h about 9/11. Ever since 9/11 the mainst ream media have worked hand -in -glove wit h the government in orchest rat ing a mood of pat riot ic fervour making any expressions of doubt s about the official leadership of the count ry tant amount to disloyalt y. Media personalit ies, such as Bill Maher, who quest ioned, even casually, the official narrat ive were given pink slips, sidelined, and silenced, sending a chilling message of intimidat ion to anyone tempt ed to voice dissident opinions. Waving the American flag became a subst itute for crit ical and independent thought , and slogans such as \"Unit ed We Stand\" were used as blanket s to smot her what ever crit ical impulses exist ed. This thought -st opping equat ion of pat riot ism wit h unquest ioning accept ance of the present administ rat ions policies has played into the hands of those president ial advisors who have seen 9/11 not as a nat ional tragedy but —in the phrase used by Secret ary of Def ense Donald Rumsf eld during a TV interview wit h Jim Lehrer on the second anniversary of the attacks—\"a blessing in disguise. \" As the spell cast by pat riot eering has begun to wear off, there is anot her relat ed dynamic at work to keep us from the trut h— what psychiat rist s describe as \"denial. \" The unpleasant realit ies of the Iraq occupat ion make it difficult for most Americans to acknowledge that the whole undert aking, including the deat h and maiming of young Americans, was based on a willf ul dist ort ion of realit y by the elect ed leadership of the count ry—namely, the suggest ion that Saddam Hussein was responsible for 9/11. This unpleasant ness is magnif ied many times over if what is at stake is the possibilit y that the terrible event s of 9/11 were from the out set , or bef ore, obscured by deliberat ely woven net works of falsehoods. Part of the impulse to deny is a desperat e wish to avoid coming face -to-face wit h the gruesome realit ies that are embedded in the power struct ure of government that cont rols our lives. Grif fin's book is a much -needed ant idot e for the collect ive denial that has paralyzed the conscience and consciousness of the nat ion during these past few years. At the very least , it should give rise to a debat e that is late, but far bet ter late than never. Long ago Thomas Jef ferson warned that the \"price of libert y is eternal vigilance. \" There is no excuse at this stage of American development for a post ure of polit ical innocence, including an unquest ioning accept ance of the good faith of our government . After all, there has been a long hist ory of manipulat ed public belief s, especially in mat ters of war and peace. Hist orians are in increasing agreement that the fact s were manipulat ed"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"(1) in the explosion of the USS Maine to just ify the start of the Spanish -American War (1898), (2) wit h respect to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor to just ify the previously unpopular ent ry into World War II.

The official explanat ions of such hist oric event s as the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the assassinat ion of President Kennedy have also not stood up to scrut iny by object ive scholars. In these respect s, the breaking of trust bet ween government and citizenry in the Unit ed States has deep hist orical root s, and is not at all merely a part isan indict ment of the current leadership associat ed wit h the right wing of the Republican Part y. But it does pose for all of us a fundament al, haunt ing quest ion. Why should the official account of 9/11 be treat ed as sacrosanct and accept ed at face value, especially as it is the rat ionale for some of the most dangerous undert akings in the whole hist ory of the world ? As Grif fin shows, it is not necessary to go along wit h every suspicious inference in order to conclude that the official account of 9/11 is thoroughly unconvincing. His approach is based on the cumulat ive impact of the many sof t spot s in what is officially claimed to have happened, sof t spot s that relat e to advance not ice and several indicat ions of act ions facilit ating the prospect s of attack, to the peculiar gaps bet ween the port rayal of the attack by the media and government and independent evidence of what act ually occurred, and to the unwillingness of the government to cooperat e wit h what meager effort s at inquiry have been mount ed. Any part of this story is enough to vindicat e Grif fin's basic cont ent ion that this count ry and the world deserve a comprehensive, credible, and immediat e account ing of the how and why of that fateful day. Such a step would exhibit today the enduring wisdom of Ben Franklins celebrat ed response when asked what the Const itutional Convent ion in Philadelphia had accomplished: \"A republic, if you keep it.\" —Richard Falk INTRODUCTI ON The attacks of 9/11 have often been compared wit h the attacks on Pearl Harbor. Invest igat ive report er James Bamf ord, for example, has writ ten about President Bush's behavior \"in the middle of a modern -day Pearl Harbor. \" > 1 CBS News report ed that the president himself , bef ore going to bed on 9/11, wrot e in his diary: \"The Pearl Harbor of the 21 st cent ury took place today. \" > 2 This comparison has often been made for the sake of arguing that the American response to 9/11 should be similar to the American response to Pearl Harbor. Just after the president s address to the nat ion on Sept ember 11, 2001, Henry Kissinger post ed an online art icle in which he said: \"The government should be charged wit h a syst emat ic response that , one hopes, will end the way that the attack on Pearl Harbor ended — wit h the dest ruct ion of the syst em that is responsible for it.\" > 3 An edit orial in Time magazine that appeared right after the attacks urged: \"For once, let's have no fatuous rhet oric about 'healing. '. . . A day cannot live in infamy wit hout the nourishment of rage. Let 's have rage. What 's needed is a unif ied, unif ying Pearl Habor son of purple American fury. \" > 4 Some of the comparisons have point ed out that the attacks of 9/11 did indeed evoke a response, calling for the use of US milit ary power, similar to that produced by Pearl Harbor. Quot ing a predict ion made in 2000 by soon -to-be top officials in the Bush administ rat ion that the changes they desired would be difficult unless \"a new Pearl Harbor\" occurred, > 5 Aust ralian journalist John Pilger wrot e: \"The attacks of 11 Sept ember 2001 provided the new Pearl Harbor. '\" > 6 A member of the US Army's Inst itute for Strat egic Studies report ed that after 9/11, \"Public support for milit ary act ion is at levels that parallel the public react ion after the attack at Pearl Harbor. \" > 7 These comparisons of 9/11 wit h Pearl Harbor do not seem unjust ified. The event s of 9/11, virt ually everyone agrees, were the most import ant event s of recent times — for bot h America and the rest of the world. The attacks of that day have provided the basis for a signif icant rest rict ion on civil libert ies in the Unit ed States (just as Pearl Harbor led to rest rict ions on the civil libert ies of Japanese Americans). > 8 Those attacks have also been the basis of a worldwide \"war on terror\" led by the Unit ed States, wit h the wars in Afghanist an and Iraq being the two major episodes thus far. The Bush administ rat ions \"war on terror\" is, moreover, widely perceived as a pret ext for a more aggressive imperialism. Phyllis Bennis, for example, says that 9/11 has result ed in \"foreign policy imposed on the rest of the world through an unchallenged law of empire. \" > 9 Of course, a few hist orians have been point ing out for some time that American leaders have long desired an empire covering the whole world. > 10 But most crit ics of US foreign policy believe that the"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"imperialism of the Bush II administ rat ion, especially since 9/11, has been much more explicit , far- reaching, and arrogant . > 11 Richard Falk has, in fact , ref erred to it as \"the global dominat ion project .\" > 12 Alt hough there was an out pouring of good will toward America after 9/11 and a widespread willingness to accede to its claim that the attacks gave it a mandat e to wage a worldwide war on terrorism, this good will was quickly exhaust ed. American foreign policy is now crit icized around the world more widely and severely than ever bef ore, even more so than during the war in Viet nam. The American answer to all crit icism, however, is 9/11. When Europeans crit icized the Bush administ rat ions intent ion to go to war against Iraq, for example, several US opinion -makers support ive of the war explained the difference in percept ion by saying that the Europeans had not suf fered the attacks of 9/11. The Fai lure of the Press Given the role of 9/11 in leading to this much more explicit and aggressive imperialism, some observers have suggest ed that hist orians will come to look back on it as the real beginning of the 21st cent ury. > 13 Nevert heless, in spit e of the virt ually universal agreement that 9/11 has been of such transcendent import ance, there has been little public scrut iny of this event itself . On the first anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, the New York Times wrot e: \"One year later, the public knows less about the circumst ances of 2,801 deat hs at the foot of Manhat tan in broad daylight than people in 1912 knew wit hin weeks about the Tit anic. \" > 14 That was the case in part because the Bush administ rat ion, arguing that an invest igat ion would be a dist ract ion from the needed \"war on terrorism, \" resist ed the call for a special commission. But the publics lack of informat ion about 9/11 was also due in large part to the fact that the Times and the rest of the mainline press had not aut horized invest igat ive report s, through which the publics lack of knowledge might have been overcome. Anot her year later, furt hermore, the situat ion remained virt ually the same. On Sept ember 11, 2003, a writ er for the Philadelphia Daily News asked: \"why after 730 days do we know so little about what really happened that day ?\" > 15 The American press has, in part icular, provided no in-dept h invest igat ion of whet her the official account of what happened fits wit h the available evidence and is otherwise plausible. > 16 Many newspaper and television stories have, to be sure, raised several dist urbing quest ions about the official account , showing that there are element s of it that do not seem to make sense or that seem to cont radict cert ain fact s. But the press has not conf ront ed government officials wit h these apparent implausibilit ies and cont radict ions. The mass media have not , moreover, provided the public wit h any comprehensive overviews that lay out all the dist urbing quest ions of which they are aware. There have been many very import ant stories by a number of journalist s, including the internat ionally known, award -winning journalist Gregory Palast and Canada's award -winning Barrie Zwicker (see not es > 16 and > 18). But such stories, if even seen, have been largely forgot ten by the collect ive consciousness, as they have remained individual product s of brilliant and courageous report ing, having thus far not been allowed to add up to anyt hing signif icant . Finally, although strong crit icisms of the official account have been present ed by many otherwise credible individuals, the mass media have not exposed the public to their views. Crit icisms of the official account are, to be sure, inflammat ory, for to reject the official account is to imply that US leaders, including the president , have const ruct ed a massive lie. And if they did const ruct a false account , they would have done so, most people would assume, in order to cover up their own complicit y. And that is indeed the conclusion of most crit ics of the official account . That would cert ainly be an inflammat ory charge. But how can we claim to have a free press — a Fourt h Est ate — if it fails to invest igat e serious charges made against a sitting president on the grounds that they are too inflammat ory ? The charges against President Nixon in the Wat ergat e scandal were inflammat ory. The charges against President Reagan in the Iran -Cont ra affair were inflammat ory. The various charges brought against President Clint on were inflammat ory. In all these cases, however, the press report ed the issues (albeit in the first two cases rat her belat edly). It is precisely in such situat ions that we most need an independent press. But the press has failed to do its job wit h regard to 9/11 even though if the official account of 9/11 were found to be false, the consequences would be enormous — much more so than wit h any of those prior scandals. The official account of 9/11 has been used as the just ificat ion for the wars in Afghanist an and Iraq, which have result ed in the deat hs not only of thousands of combat ant s but also of far more innocent civilians than were killed on 9/11. This account has been used as the just ificat ion for dozens of other operat ions around the world, most of which are largely unknown to the American people. It has been used to just ify the USA PATRI OT Act , through which the civil libert ies of Americans have been curt ailed. And it has been used to just ify the indef init e incarcerat ion of count less people in Guant anamo and elsewhere. And yet the press has been less aggressive in quest ioning President Bush about 9/11 than it was in quest ioning President Clint on about his relat ionship wit h Monica Lewinsky, a very trivial mat ter by comparison. The failure of the American media in this regard has been admit ted by some insiders. For example, Rena Golden, execut ive vice -president and general manager of CNN Internat ional, was quot ed as saying in August of 2002 that the American press had censored itself on bot h 9/11 and"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"the war in Afghanist an. \"Anyone who claims the US media didn't censor itself ,\" Golden added, \"is kidding you. And this isn't just a CNN issue — every journalist who was in any way involved in 9/11 is part ly responsible. \" > 17 As to why this has been the case, CBS anchorman Dan Rat her has said: There was a time in Sout h Africa that people would put flaming tires around people's necks if they dissent ed. And in some ways the fear is that you will be necklaced here, you will have a flaming tire of lack of pat riot ism put around your neck. Now it is that fear that keeps journalist s from asking the toughest of the tough quest ions. > 18 Rat her's conf ession surely explains at least part of the press's ret icence to quest ion the official account , especially since journalist s perceived as unpat riot ic are in danger of being fired. One of the chief crit ics of the official account , Thierry Meyssan, suggest s that Americans have viewed any crit icism of the official account to be not only unpat riot ic but even sacrilegious. On Sept ember 12, Meyssan reminds us, President Bush announced his intent ion to lead \"a monument al struggle of Good versus Evil. \" > 19 On Sept ember 13, he declared that the next day would be a Nat ional Day of Prayer and Remembrance for the Vict ims of the Terrorist Attacks. And on Sept ember 14, the president himself , surrounded by Billy Graham, a cardinal, a rabbi, and an imam as well as four previous president s and many members of Congress, delivered the sermon. In this sermon, he said: Our responsibilit y to hist ory is already clear: to answer these attacks and rid the world of evil. War has been waged against us by stealt h and deceit and murder. This nat ion is peacef ul, but fierce when stirred to anger. ...In every generat ion, the world has produced enemies of human freedom. They have attacked America, because we are freedom's home and def ender. And the commit ment of our fathers is now the calling of our time. ...[W] e ask almight y God to wat ch over our nat ion, and grant us pat ience and resolve in all that is to come. ... And may He always guide our count ry. God bless America. > 20 Through this unprecedent ed event , in which the president of the Unit ed States issued a declarat ion of war from a cat hedral, Meyssan observes, \"the American government consecrat ed. ..its version of event s. From then on, any quest ioning of the official trut h would be seen as sacrilege. \" > 21 9/II and the Left If raising dist urbing quest ions about the official account would be seen as bot h unpat riot ic and sacrilegious, it is not surprising that , as bot h Rena Golden and Dan Rat her admit , the mainline press in America has not raised these quest ions. It is also not surprising that right -wing and even middle -of -the -road comment ators on polit ical affairs have not raised serious quest ions about the official account . It is not even surprising that some of them — including Jean Bet hke Elsht ain, a prof essor of social and polit ical ethics — have declared that the accusat ion of official complicit y is beyond the pale of reasonable debat e, so that any argument s on its behalf can simply be ignored. Elsht ain, calling the suggest ion that American officials, including the president , were complicit in the attacks \"prepost erous, \" adds: \"This sort of inflammat ory madness exist s out side the boundary of polit ical debat e\" and theref ore does not even \"deserve a hearing. \" > 22 From this perspect ive, it is not necessary to examine the evidence put forward by crit ics of the official account , even though some of these crit ics are fellow intellect uals teaching in neighboring universit ies — such as two well -respect ed Canadian academics, economist Michel Chossudovsky and social philosopher John McMurt ry. > 23 Alt hough Elsht ain point s out that \"[i]f we get our descript ions of event s wrong, our analyses and our ethics will be wrong too, \" > 24 she evident ly thinks it unnecessary to consider the possibilit y that the official descript ion about the event s of 9/11 might be wrong. Alt hough this attitude is unf ort unat e, especially when it is expressed wit hin the intellect ual communit y, it is not surprising. What is surprising, however, is that America's leftist crit ics of US policy, who are seldom worried about being called either unpat riot ic or sacrilegious, have for the most part not explored, at least in public discourse, the possibilit y of official complicit y. > 25 These crit ics have, to be sure, been ext remely crit ical of the way in which the Bush administ rat ion has responded to 9/11. They have, in part icular, point ed out that this administ rat ion has used 9/11 as an excuse to enact policies and carry out operat ions that have little if any relat ion to either punishing the perpet rat ors of the attacks or prevent ing furt her such attacks in the future. They have even point ed out that most of these policies and operat ions were already on the agenda of the Bush administ rat ion bef ore the attacks, so that 9/11 was not the cause but merely the pret ext for enact ing them. These crit ics also know that the Unit ed States has many times in the past fabricat ed an \"incident \" as a pret ext for going to war — most not oriously for the wars against Mexico, Cuba, and Viet nam. > 26 But few of these crit ics have seriously discussed, at"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"least in public, whet her this might also be the case wit h 9/11, even though a demonst rat ion of this fact , if it were true, would surely be the most effect ive way to undermine policies of the Bush administ rat ion to which they are so strongly opposed. Abjuring a \"conspiracy theory, they accept , at least implicidy, a \"coincidence theory, \" according to which the attacks of 9/11 were, from the administ rat ions point of view, simply a godsend, which just happened to allow it to carry out its agenda. An example is provided by Rahul Mahajan, a brilliant and out spoken crit ic of US imperialism. He analyzes the themes of US imperialism since 9/11 in the light of the document alluded to earlier that ment ioned the need for a \"new Pearl Harbor, \" this being Rebuilding America's Def enses, which was prepared by the Project for the New American Cent ury. Three of the major themes of this document , Mahajan emphasizes, are the need to place more milit ary bases around the world from which power can be project ed, the need to bring about \"regime change\" in count ries unf riendly to American interest s, and the need for great ly increased milit ary spending, especially for \"missile def ense\" — explicidy underst ood not as det errence but as \"a prerequisit e for maint aining American preeminence\" by prevent ing other count ries from det erring us. Mahajan then point s out that \"[t]he 9/11 attacks were a nat ural opport unit y to jack up the milit ary budget \" and that the other ideas in this document , in conjunct ion wit h the well -known preoccupat ion of Bush and Cheney wit h oil, provided the major themes of their post -9/ 11 imperial strat egy. Mahajan also not es that this document said that the desired transf ormat ion of the milit ary would probably be polit ically impossible \"absent some cat ast rophic and cat alyzing event — like a new Pearl Harbor. \" And Mahajan even adds that \"wit hin a year they [the aut hors of this document ] had their Pearl Harbor and the chance to turn their imperial fant asies into realit y.\" After point ing out all of this, however, Mahajan opt s for coincidence over conspiracy, saying: \"Conspiracy theorist s will no doubt rejoice, but this, like so many event s in the hist ory of US foreign policy, is simply anot her example of Past eur's famous axiom that 'Fort une favors the prepared mind. \" > 27 Mahajan may, of course, be right . But he gives us no reason to think so. He, in part icular, reveals no sign of having studied the evidence provided by those who have argued that the attacks could have been successf ul only through the complicit y of the US government . How Thi s Book Came About Whet her or not it is true that Mahajan dismissed the evidence wit hout examinat ion, it was cert ainly true of me. Unt il the spring of 2003, I had not looked at any of the evidence. I was vaguely aware that mere were people, at least on the Internet , who were offering evidence against the official account of 9/11 and were suggest ing a revisionist account , according to which US officials were complicit . But I did not take the time to try to find their websit es. I had been studying the hist ory of American expansionism and imperialism quit e intensely since 9/11, so I knew that the US government had fabricat ed \"incident s\" as an excuse to go to war several times bef ore. Nevert heless, although the thought did cross my mind that 9/11 might likewise have been arranged, I did not take this possibilit y seriously. It seemed to me simply beyond belief that the Bush administ rat ion — even the Bush administ rat ion — would do such a heinous thing. I assumed that those who were claiming otherwise must be \"conspiracy theorist s\" in the derogat ory sense in which this term is usually employed — which means, roughly, \"crackpot s.\" I knew that if they were right , this would be very import ant . But I was so conf ident that they must be wrong — that their writ ings would consist merely of loony theories based on wild inferences from dubious evidence — that I had no mot ivat ion to invest time and energy in tracking these writ ings down. I fully sympat hize, theref ore, wit h the fact that most people have not examined the evidence. Life is short and the list of conspiracy theories is long, and we all must exercise judgment about which things are wort h our invest ment of time. I had assumed that conspiracy theories about 9/11 were below the threshold of possible credibilit y. But then a fellow prof essor sent me an e-mail message that provided some of the relevant websit es. Knowing her to be a sensible person, I looked up some of the mat erial on the Internet , especially a massive timeline ent itled \"Was 9/11 Allowed to Happen ?\" by an independent researcher named Paul Thompson. > 28 I was surprised, even amazed, to see — even though Thompson limit s himself strict ly to mainline sources > 29 — how much evidence he had found that point s to the conclusion that the Bush administ rat ion did indeed intent ionally allow the attacks of 9/11 to happen. At about the same time, I happened to read Gore Vidal's Dreaming War: Blood for Oil and the Cheney -Bush Junt a, which point ed me to the most ext ensive book on 9/11, The War on Freedom: How and Why America Was Attacked Sept ember 11, 2001, by Naf eez Ahmed, an independent researcher in England. > 30 Ahmed's book provides an organized, ext ensively document ed argument that direct ly challenges the accept ed wisdom about 9/11, which is that it result ed from a \"breakdown\" wit hin and among our intelligence agencies. > 31 Ahmed, like Thompson, suggest s that the attacks must have result ed from complicit y in high places, not merely from incompet ence in lower places. Ahmed's and Thompsons mat erial taken toget her, I saw, provided a strong prima facie case for this cont ent ion, cert ainly strong enough to merit an ext ensive invest igat ion by the American press, the US Congress, > 32 and the 9/11 Independent Commission, > 33 all of which had thus far operat ed on the assumpt ion that 9/11 result edf rom"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"intelligence and communicat ion failures. I also saw, however, that the work of Thompson and Ahmed was not likely to reach very many of the American people. Thompson's timelines, while ext remely helpf ul for researchers wit h the time and pat ience to work through them, were not easily readable by ordinary citizens, part ly because they were available only online and part ly because, as the name \"timeline\" indicat es, the evidence was arranged chronologically rat her than topically. > 34 And, although Ahmed's evidence was in a book and was arranged topically, the book was quit e long and cont ained far more mat erial than needed to support the basic argument . Much of this addit ional mat erial was, furt hermore, in the book's early chapt ers, so that one had to work through several chapt ers bef ore get ting to the evidence that direct ly cont radict ed the official account . If the import ant informat ion provided by Ahmed and Thompson were to reach many people, including busy members of Congress and the press, somet hing else would be needed. I decided, accordingly, to writ e a magazine art icle that would summarize the main evidence and also point interest ed readers to the studies of Thompson, Ahmed, and others present ing a revisionist account of 9/11. But that art icle grew into a book -lengt h manuscript , because I soon found that , even though I tried to limit myself to the most import ant evidence, it was impossible wit hin the conf ines of an art icle to present an intelligible account that would do just ice to the evidence that has been provided by these researchers. After I began writ ing, furt hermore, I learned of the work of the previously ment ioned French researcher, Thierry Meyssan, in part icular his hypot hesis that the aircraf t that hit the Pent agon could not have been a Boeing 757, which is what Flight 77 was, but must have been a guided missile. When I first learned of this revisionist hypot hesis, I — probably like most people now reading my report of it — assumed it was complet ely absurd. Surely the difference bet ween a gigant ic 757 and a relat ively small missile is so great that if the Pent agon had been hit merely by a missile, Pent agon officials could not have convinced anyone that it was a 757! Did we not learn from press report s that the hole creat ed in the side of the Pent agon was 200 feet wide and five stories high ? Had we not learned from one of the passengers on Flight 77 — TV comment ator Barbara Olson — that it was headed toward Washingt on ? And had not eyewit nesses ident ified it? Virt ually everyone, including most crit ics of the official account of 9/11, accept ed the idea that the Pent agon was hit by Flight 77. How could they all be wrong ? Nevert heless, after I got Meyssan's books and read them for myself , I saw that his case as absurd as it had seemed at first glance, is quit e strong. I event ually became convinced, in fact , that it is wit h regard to the strike on the Pent agon that — assuming Meyssan's descript ions of the evidence to be accurat e the official account seems most obviously false. Or at least that it is tied for first place for this honor. The fact that the official account of the strike on the Pent agon is still widely accept ed provides an especially good example, theref ore, of the fact that most of the public has simply not been exposed to the relevant evidence. The present book seeks to bring toget her all the major strands of this evidence. No previous book has done this. Ahmed's book, while easily the most comprehensive, does not have much of the evidence cont ained in Thompson's timelines and in Meyssan's books. And Meyssan's books while cont aining import ant evidence not available elsewhere, do not have most of the informat ion provided by Ahmed and Thompson. The same is true of the other most import ant book in English on the subject , Michel Chossudovsky's War and Globalisat ion: The Trut h Behind Sept ember 11. As its subt itle indicat es, it focuses on the background to 9/11, dealing wit h 9/11 itself only brief ly. In the present book, I have brought toget her what seems to me the most import ant evidence found in these > 35 and some other sources. > 36 The Book's Contents As I see it, five major types of evidence have been raised against the official account . The first type, which involves inconsist encies and implausibilit ies in the official account of what happened on 9/11 itself , is discussed in the four chapt ers of Part I. The four other types of evidence are discussed in Part II. All this evidence is organized in terms of a number of \"dist urbing quest ions, \" > 37 which are dist urbing precisely because they suggest that official account is, as the tide of the English translat ion of Meyssan's first book on the subject calls it, a \"big lie. \" > 38 They are also dist urbing beause they suggest the revisionist thesis that the attacks of 9/11, which President Bush has right ly called evil, were carried out wit h the complicit y or so officials of the Bush administ rat ion itself . In the Conclusion, I ask whet her the best explanat ion of the evidence present ed in the prior chapt ers is indeed, as the revisionist s suggest , official complicit y in the attacks of 9/11. I then discuss the implicat ions for the kind of invest igat ion now needed. Possi ble Meani ngs of \"Offi cial Compl icity\" Alt hough the revisionist writ ings on which this book draws charge official complicit y in the attacks of 911, one thing missing in them is any caref ul discussion of just what they mean by \"of ficial complicit y.\" There are at least eight possible views of what official complicit y in the attacks of 9/11 might mean. In order that readers can decide, as they examine the evidence, which kind of"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"official complicit y, if any, the evidence support s, I list these eight possible views here in ascending order of seriousness — meaning the seriousness of the charge against the Bush administ rat ion that the view would imply. 1. Const ruct ion of a False Acount : One possible view, is that although US officials played no role in facilit ating the attacks and did not even expect them, they const ruct ed a false account of what really happened — whet her to prot ect Nat ional Securit y, to cover up pot ent ially embarrassing fact s, to exploit the attacks to enact their agenda, or for some other reason. Athough this would be the least serious charge, it would be suf ficient ly serious for impeachment — especiallv if the president had lied about 9/11 for personal gain or to advance some pre -est ablished agenda, such as attacking Afghanist an and Iraq. 2. Somet hing Expect ed by Intelligence Agencies: A second possible view is that although they had no specif ic informat ion about the attacks in advance, some US intelligence agencies — such as the FBI , the CIA, and some intelligence agencies of the US milit ary — expect ed some sort of attacks to occur. Alt hough they played no role in planning the attacks, they perhaps played a role in facilit ating them in the sense of deliberat ely not taking steps to prevent them. Then, having done this wit hout Whit e House knowledge, they persuaded the Whit e House after 9/11 not only to cover up their guilt , by const ruct ing a false account , but also to carry out the agenda for which the attacks were intended to gain support . 3. Specif ic Event s Expect ed by Intelligence Agencies: A third possible view is that intelligence agencies (but not the Whit e House) had specif ic informat ion about the timing and the target s of the attacks. 4. Intelligence Agencies Involved in Planning: A fourt h possible view is that intelligence agencies (but not the Whit e House) act ively part icipat ed planning the attacks. 5. Pent agon Involved in Planning: A fifth possible view is that the Pent agon (but not the Whit e House) act ively part icipat ed in planning the attacks 6. Somet hing Expect ed by Whit e House: A sixt h possible view is that although the Whit e House had no specif ic knowledge of the attacks in advance, it expect ed some sort of attacks to occur and was a part y to facilit ating them, at least in the sense of not ordering that they be prevent ed. > 39 This view allows for the possibilit y that the Whit e House might have been shocked by the amount of deat h and dest ruct ion caused by the attacks that were act ually carried out . 7. Specif ic Advance Knowledge by Whit e House: A sevent h possible view is that the Whit e House had specif ic foreknowledge of the target s and the timing of the attacks. 8. Whit e House Involved in Planning: An eight h possible view is that the Whit e House was a part y to planning the attacks. As these possibilit ies show, a charge that 9/11 involved \"complicit y\" or \"conspiracy\" on the part of US officials can be underst ood in many ways, several of which do not involve act ive involvement in the planning, and most of which do not involve president ial involvement in this planning. One reason these dist inct ions are import ant is that they show that discussion of the idea of official complicit y — whet her such complicit y is being charged or reject ed — needs to be more nuanced than is often the case. For example, the charge that Jean Bet hke Elsht ain reject s as \"prepost erous\" is the \"charge that American officials, up to and including the president of the Unit ed States, engineered the attacks to bolst er their popularit y.\" > 40 In so wording it, she not only equat es the charge of official complicit y wit h the eight h of the possible views list ed above, which is the strongest charge, but also ties this charge to the imput ation of a specif ic mot ive to the American officials allegedly involved — that of bolst ering their own popularit y. Having dismissed that highly specif ic charge as prepost erous, she evident ly assumes that the whole idea of official complicit y has been laid to rest . But there are many other possibilit ies. For example, Michael Parent i, one of the few well -known leftist thinkers to have suggest ed some form of official complicit y, point s out , like Mahajan, that the attacks were so convenient that they have provoked suspicion: \"The Sept ember terrorist attacks creat ed such a serviceable pret ext for react ionism at home and imperialist expansion abroad as to leave many people suspect ing that the US government itself had a hand in the event .\" Parent i at first seems to dismiss this suspicion as complet ely as Mahajan, saying: \"I find it hard to believe that the Whit e House or the CIA act ively part icipat ed in a conspiracy to dest roy the World Trade Cent er and part of the Pent agon, killing such large numbers of Americans in order to creat e a casus belli against Afghanist an. \" > 41 Parent i, however, does not stop there. Cit ing an art icle by Pat rick Mart in, who ref ers to some fact s suggest ing official complicit y, Parent i endorses Mart ins conclusion — that although the US government did not plan the det ails of the attacks or ant icipat e that thousands of people would be killed, it \"expect ed somet hing to happen and looked the other way. \" > 42 Parent i thereby illust rat es the second or, more likely, the sixt h of the possible views."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"In any case, I have found, as I have said, that the revisionist s have made a strong prima facie case for at least some version of the charge of official complicit y. To say that they have made a convincing case would require a judgment that the evidence that they cite is reliable. And, although I have repeat ed only evidence that seemed credible to me, I have not independendy verif ied the accuracy of this evidence. As the reader will see, this evidence is so ext ensive and of such a nat ure that no individual — especially no individual wit h very limit ed time and resources — could check out its accuracy. It is for this reason that I claim only that these revisionist s have present ed a strong prima facie case for official complicit y, strong enough to merit invest igat ions by those who do have the necessary resources to carry them out — the press and the US Congress. If a signif icant port ion of the evidence summarized here holds up, the conclusion that the attacks of 9/11 succeeded because of official complicit y would become virt ually inescapable. I should perhaps emphasize that it is not necessary for all of the evidence to stand up, given the nat ure of the argument . Some argument s are, as we say, \"only as strong as the weakest link. \" These are deduct ive argument s, in which each step in the argument depends on the trut h of the previous step. If a single premise is found to be false, the argument fails. However, the argument for official complicit y in 9/11 is a cumulat ive argument . This kind of argument is a general argument consist ing of several part icular argument s that are independent from each other. As such, each part icular argument provides support for all the others. Rat her than being like a chain, a cumulat ive argument is more like a cable composed of many strands. Each strand strengt hens the cable. But if there are many strands, the cable can still hold a lot of weight even if some of them unravel. As the reader will see, there are many strands in the argument for official complicit y in 9/11 summarized in this book. If the purport ed evidence on which some of these are based turns out to be unreliable, that would not necessarily undermine the overall argument . This cumulat ive argument would then simply be support ed by fewer strands. And some of the strands are such that , if the evidence on which they are based is conf irmed, the case could be support ed by one or two of them. > 43 \"Conspi racy Theori es\" Bef ore turning to the evidence, however, we should pause to consider the fact , to which allusion has been made, that it seems widely assumed that any such case can be reject ed a priori by point ing out that it is a \"conspiracy theory. \" Indeed, it almost seems to be a requirement or admission into public discourse to announce that one reject s conspiracy theories. What is the logic behind this thinking ? It cannot be that we literally reject the very idea that conspiracies occur. We all accept conspiracy theories of all sort s. We accept a conspiracy theory whenever we believe that two or more people have conspired in secret to achieve some goal, such as to rob a bank, def raud cust omers, or fix prices, we would be more honest , theref ore, if we followed the precedent of Michael Moore, who has said: \"Now, I'm not into conspiracy theories, except the ones that are true. \" > 44 To ref ine this point slight ly, we can say that we accept all those conspiracy theories that we believe to be true, while we reject all those that we believe to be false. We cannot , theref ore, divide people into those who accept conspiracy theories and those who reject them. The division bet ween people on this issue involves simply the quest ion of wich conspiracy theories they accept and which ones they reject . > 45 To apply this analysis to the attacks of 9/11: It is false to suggest that those who allege that the attacks occurred because of official complicit y are \"conspiracy theorist s\" while those who accept the official account are not . People differ on this issue merely in terms of which conspiracy theory they hold to be true, or at least most probable. According to the official account , the attacks of 9/11 occurred because of a conspiracy among Muslims, wit h Osama bin Laden being the chief conspirat or. Revisionist s reject that theory, at least as a suf ficient account of what happened, maint aining that the attacks cannot be sat isfact orily explained wit hout post ulat ing conspiracy by officials of the US government , at least in allowing the attacks to succeed. The choice, accordingly, is simply bet ween (some version of) the received conspiracy theory and (some version of) the revisionist conspiracy theory. Which of these compet ing theories we accept depends, or at least should depend, on which one we believe to be bet ter support ed by the relevant fact s. Those who hold the revisionist theory have become convinced that there is considerable evidence that not only suggest s the falsit y of the received conspiracy theory, which we are calling \"the official account ,\" but also point s to the trut h of the revisionist theory.

Some of the reasons for this wariness are valid. One concern is that a focus on exposing conspirat orial crimes of present office -holders may ref lect the naive asssumpt ion that if only we can replace those individuals wit h bet ter ones, things will be fine. Underlying that worry is the concern that a focus on conspirat ors can divert attent ion from the more import ant issue of the struct ural problems in the nat ional and global order that need to be overcome. But although those dangers must be guarded against , we should also avoid a too strong dichot omy bet ween struct ural and conspirat orial analysis. For one thing, although struct ural analysis is essent ial for any deep underst anding of social processes, struct ures as such, being abst ract ions, do not enact themselves. They are influent ial only insof ar as they are embodied in agent s — bot h individual and inst itutional — who act in terms of them. These agent s, furt hermore, are not fully det ermined by the dominant values of their societ ies. They have degrees of freedom, which they can use to act in ways that are more or less wise, more or less just , and more or less legal. When polit ical leaders enact policies that are egregiously unjust , dangerous, and even illegal, it is import ant to replace them wit h leaders who are at least somewhat bet ter. Finally, and most import ant , the exposure of a conspiracy may, rat her than divert ing attent ion from a societ y's problemat ic struct ures, turn attent ion to them. For example, if it became evident that our nat ional polit ical leaders caused or at least allowed the attacks of 9/11 and that they did so part ly because they had deeply embodied cert ain values pervasive of our societ y, we might finally decide that a societ y-wide reorient ation is in order. 26 This pract ice is, of course, not unique to America. It is generally agreed, for example, mat the \"Mukden incident ,\" in which an explosion dest royed part of the Japanese railway in Manchuria, was engineered by Japanese army officers \"as an excuse to conquer Manchuria\" (Walt er LaFeber, The Clash: US -Japanese Relat ions Throughout Hist ory [New York: Nort on, 1997] , 166). 27 Rahul Mahajan, Full Spect rum Dominance: US Power in Iraq and Beyond (New York: Seven Stories, 2003), 59, 50, 48. 28 Paul Thompson's main timeline, ent itled \"Was 9/11 Allowed to Happen ? The Complet e Timeline, \" list s possibly relevant event s ext ending over many years and fills some 200 single - spaced pages. 29 This is one respect in which Thompson sees himself as differing from some other researchers, such as Michael Ruppert , ment ioned in not e 36, below. 30 Gore Vidal, Dreaming War. Blood for Oil and the Cheney -Bush Junt a (New York: Thunder's Mout h/Nat ion Books, 2002); Naf eez Mosaddeq Ahmed, The War on Freedom: How and Why America Was Attacked Sept ember 11, 2001 (Joshua Tree Calif , Tree of Life Publicat ions, 2002). Vidal, one prominent member of the American left who has reject ed the official account of 9-11, endorses Ahmed's book -- calling it \"the best , most balanced report , thus far\" (l4) -- and summarizes some of its argument . 31 See Breakdown: How America's Intelligence Failures Led to Sept ember 11 (Washingt on: Regnery 2002), by Bill Gert z, a journalist for the Washingt on Times. A more recent version of this thesis is provided in Gerald Posner, WhyAmerica Slept : The Failure to Prevent 9/11 (New York: Random House, 2003) Posner attribut es the failure to breakdowns (xi), blunders (xii, 169), missed opport unit ies (xii, 146), invest igat ive mix -ups (34), mist akes (150, 155, 169), incompet ence and bad judgment (142, 167), stifling bureaucracy (173), and especially the failure of agencies to share informat ion wit h each other (35, 44 -47, 59, 178). \"The failure to have prevent ed 9/11, \" assert s Posner, \"was a syst emic one\" (xii). The task bef ore us, theref ore, is simply to fix the syst em. As Walt er Russell Mead says (wit hout crit icism) in a book review, \"the message of Why America, Slept is on balance a hopef ul one. Incompet ence in our securit y est ablishment is somet hing we can address\" (\"The Tragedy of Nat ional Complacency, \" New York Times, Oct ober 29, 2003). 32 A Joint Inquiry into the attacks was carried out in 2002 by the intelligence commit tees of the US Senat e and House of Represent atives. Alt hough this Joint Inquiry had complet ed its final report by December of 2002, the Bush administ rat ion long ref used to allow it to be released. Only a very"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"brief summary of this final report was made public (it can be read at http://intelligence. senat e.gov/ press. htm under December 11, 2002). Finally, late in July 2003, the final report itself was released. Alt hough discussions in the press described the report as surprisingly crit ical, the crit icism was limit ed to charges of incompet ence. Signif icant port ions of the final report were, to be sure, delet ed in the name of nat ional securit y, but I see no reason to believe that these delet ions — which report edly involved foreign count ries, especially Saudi Arabia — cont ained any accusat ions of complicit y in 9/11 by US officials. Possible reasons for the inadequacy of the Joint Inquiry's report are discussed in Chapt er 10. 33 Alt hough its official name is the Nat ional Commission on Terrorist Attacks upon the Unit ed States, it is informally known as the 9/11 Independent Commission. President Bush had long opposed the creat ion of any such commission, claiming that it would take resources away from the war on terrorism. But embarrassing revelat ions from the Joint Inquiry (see previous not e) report edly left him little choice (Newsweek, Sept ember 22, 2002). In November of 2002, Bush signed a bill est ablishing the commission (the websit e of which is www. 9-11 commision. gov). Problems in relat ion to this commission are discussed in Chapt er 10. 34 In the meant ime, Thompson has been developing art icles in which the mat erial is organized in terms of a large number of topics, which cont inues to grow. He also has a growing number of art icles in which he discusses various dimensions of the cont roversies about 9/11. His websit e is theref ore becoming increasingly easy to use. 35 Implicit in this statement is the fact that I do not endorse all argument s in the main sources I employ. Meyssan, for example, has some theories that I find implausible and others that seem at least insuf ficient ly support ed by evidence. 36 One failing of this book is that I have usually made no effort to discern, wit h regard to various stories and fact s report ed, which invest igat or or researcher was first responsible for report ing them. This means that I have surely in many cases failed to give proper credit . One example involves the fact that I cite Paul Thompson's timelines abundant ly while citing Michael Ruppert 's websit e, From the Wilderness (www. fromt hewilderness. com or www. copvcia. com), relat ively rarely. And yet Ruppert was one of the earliest major crit ics of the official account of 9/11. In fact , in Thompson's statement of \"credit s and sources, \" he says: \"This timeline start ed when I saw the excellent timeline at the From the Wilderness websit e and began adding to it. I found that timeline to be a great resource, but it wasn't as comprehensive as I want ed. My version has since grown into somet hing of a monst er, but the inspirat ion still lies wit h From the Wilderness\" ( www. cooperat iveresearch. org/ timeline/ index. html ). Ruppert , furt hermore, is simply one example of several researchers, such as Jared Israel, who were publishing informat ion challenging the official account almost immediat ely after 9/11. To try to sort all of this out in order to assign proper credit , however, would det ract from the task of get ting the challenge to the official account into the public discussion. Most researchers, as far as I can tell, seem more interest ed in this than in receiving credit . The quest ion of proper credit , in any case, is one that would appropriat ely be answered by some hist orian of this movement if it is successf ul. 37 In suggest ing that there are many dist urbing quest ions that have thus far not been answered, I am to some ext ent ref lect ing the attitude of the organizat ions formed by families of the vict ims of the attacks, one of which is, in fact , called \"Unanswered Quest ions\" (see www. UnansweredQuest ions. org). Other organizat ions wit h websit es include Familiy Steering Commit tee for the 9/11 Independent Commission (www. 911 Independent commission. org), Voices of Sept ember 11 th (www. voicesof sept 11. org), 9-11 Cit izens Wat ch ( www. 911 Cit izenswat ch. org ), and the 9/11 Visibilit y Project ( www. sept emberelevent h.org ). 38 This book, cited in previous not es, is a translat ion of Meyssan's L'Ef froyable impost ure (Paris Les Edit ions Carnot , 2002). 39 This view of the Whit e House could be combined wit h any of the previous five views insof ar as those views deal only wit h the involvement of other US agencies. This sixt h view, theref ore, has five possible versions. The same is true of the sevent h and eight h views. 40 Elsht ain, 2-3. 41 Michael Parent i, The Terrorism Trap: Sept ember 11 and Beyond (San Francisco: Cit y Light s, 2002), 69, 70. 42 Parent i, 70 -71, citing Pat rick Mart in, \"US Planned War in Afghanist an Long Bef ore Sept ember 11, \" World Socialist Conf erence, November 20, 2001 ( www. wsws. org/ art ides/ 2001/ nov2001/ afghn20. html ); the quot ed words, which summarize Mart ins posit ion, are Parent i's. 43 I emphasize this point because some polemicist s, when conf ront ed by a book whose conclusion they do not like, seek to undermine this conclusion by focusing on the few point s that they believe can be most easily discredit ed. That tact ic, assuming that good evidence is really present ed against those point s, is valid wit h regard to a deduct ive argument . In relat ion to a cumulat ive argument , however, it is tact ic usef ul only to those concerned wit h somet hing other than trut h. 44 Michael Moore, Dude, Where's My Count ry? (New York: Warner Books, 2003), 2. 45 To ref ine the point a little more: There are some conspiracy theories that , although we may not be convinced of their trut h, we find at least plausible, so we are willing to ent ert ain the possibilit y that they might be true. We are open, accordingly, to reading and hearing evidence intended to"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"support them. There are other conspiracy theories, by cont rast , that we find complet ely implausible, so we tend to suspect the intelligence or sanit y of people who believe them or who even ent ert ain the possibilit y of their trut h. What ever fact s they offer as evidence we reject out of hand, holding that , even if we cannot explain these fact s, the true explanat ion cannot be the one they are offering. But the quest ion of what we find complet ely implausible — 'beyond the pale' — is seldom det ermined simply by a dispassionat e considerat ion of empirical evidence. Plausibilit y is largely a mat ter of one's general worldview. We are also influenced to some degree by wishf ul- and -fearf ul thinking, in which we accept some ideas part ly because we hope thay are true and reject other ideas because we would find the thought that they are true too fright ening. At least somet imes, however, we are able, in spit e of our prejudgment s, to revise our prior ideas in light of new evidence. Most revisionist s about 9/11, in present ing their evidence, seem to be count ing on this possibilit y. Part One The Events of 9/11 CHAPTER ONE Flights 11 and 175: How coul d the Hijacker's Mi ssi ons have succeded ? I n many respect s, the strongest evidence provided by crit ics of the official account involves simply the event s of 9/11 itself . At 8:46 AM, one hijacked airplane crashed into the Nort h Tower of the World Trade Cent er (WTC). At 9:03, anot her crashed into the Sout h Tower. And at 9:38, the Pent agon was hit. In light of standard procedures for dealing wit h hijacked airplanes, however, not one of these planes should have reached its target , let alone all three of them. It is also far from clear how the New York attacks could have succeeded in the sense of causing the buildings of the WTC to collapse. There are, furt hermore, dist urbing quest ions about the third airliner — whet her it was really the aircraf t that hit the Pent agon — and about the fourt h one — whet her it was the one plane that was shot down. Finally, after examining quest ions that have been raised about all these mat ters, I will look at quest ions raised by President Bush's behavior that day. The present chapt er, however, deals only wit h Flight s 11 and 175 and the collapse of the WTC buildings. Ameri can Airlines Flight II The first plane to be hijacked was American Airlines (AA) Flight 11, which left Bost on at 7:59 AM. At 8:14, besides failing to respond to an order from FAA (Federal Aviat ion Administ rat ion) ground cont rol to climb, its radio and transponder went off, > 1 suggest ing that it had possibly been hijacked. At 8:20, wit h FAA ground cont rol wat ching its flight pat h on radar, the plane went radically off course, leading ground cont rol to conclude that it had probably been hijacked. At 8:21, flight attendant s report ed by telephone that the plane had def init ely been taken over by hijackers, who had already killed some people. At 8:28, the plane turned toward New York. At 8:44, Secret ary of Def ense Rumsf eld was in the Pent agon talking about terrorism wit h Represent ative Christ opher Cox. \"Let me tell ya, \" the Associat ed Press quot ed Rumsf eld as saying, \"I've been around the block a few times. There will be anot her event . Therewill be anot her event .\" > 2 And, if he in fact said this, he was right . Two minut es later, at 8:46, Flight 11 crashed into the WTC's Nort h Tower. This was 32 minut es after evidence that the plane had possibly been hijacked and 25 minut es after knowledge that it def init ely had been. Skept ics about the official account believe that the attempt to crash an airliner into the WTC could not have been successf ul under normal circumst ances. The basic problem, they argue, is that there are standard procedures for situat ions such as this and that , if they had been followed, Flight 11 would have been intercept ed by fight er jets wit hin 10 minut es of any sign that it may have been hijacked. Had the plane then failed to obey the standard signal to follow the fight er jets to an airport to land, it would have been shot down. This would have occurred by 8:24, or 8:30 at the latest , so that the quest ion of whet her to shoot down a commercial airliner over the heart of New York Cit y would not have arisen."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"As evidence, the skept ics cite FAA regulat ions, which inst ruct air traf fic cont rollers: Consider that an aircraf t emergency exist s...when: ...There is unexpect ed loss of radar cont act and radio communicat ions wit h any. .. aircraf t.... If...you are in doubt that a situat ion const itutes an emergency or pot ent ial emergency, handle it as though it were an emergency. > 3 Accordingly, at 8:14, the loss of radio cont act alone would have led the flight cont roller to begin emergency procedures. The loss of the transponder signal would have made the situat ion doubly suspect . The cont roller, after finding that it was impossible to re-est ablish radio cont act , would have immediat ely cont act ed the Nat ional Milit ary Command Cent er (NMCC) in the Pent agon and its Nort h American Aerospace Def ense Command (NORAD), which would have immediat ely had jets sent up — \"scrambled\" — from the nearest milit ary airport . According to spokespersons for NORAD, from the time the FAA senses that somet hing is wrong, \"it takes about one minut e\" for it to cont act NORAD, and then NORAD can cramble fight ers \"wit hin a mat ter of minut es to anywhere in the Unit ed States. \" > 4 \"According to the US Air Forces own websit e,\" report s Naf eez Ahmed, an F-15 rout inely \"goes from 'scramble order' to 29, 000 feet in only 2.5 minut es\" and then can fly at 1,850 nmph (naut ical miles per hour). > 5 If normal procedures had been followed, accordingly, Flight 11 would have been intercept ed by 8:24, and cert ainly no later than 8:30, 16 minut es bef ore it, in the act ual course of event s, crashed into the WTC. Furt hermore, even if radio cont act and the transponders signal had not been lost , the fact that the plane went radically off course at 8:20 would have led the FAA to not ify the milit ary. Every plane has a flight plan, which consist s of a sequence of geographic point s, or \"fixes, \" and, according to a report by MSNBC: Pilot s are supposed to hit each fix wit h pinpoint accuracy. If a plane deviat es by 15 degrees, or two miles from that course, the flight cont rollers will hit the panic but ton. They'll call the plane, saying \"American 11, you're deviat ing from course. \" It's considered a real emergency. > 6 So, even if the FAA had wait ed unt il the plane went off course at 8:20, the plane should have been intercept ed by 8:30, or 8:35 at the latest , again in plent y of time to prevent it from going into New York Cit y. As to what would occur upon intercept ion, Ahmed explains by quot ing the FAA manual: [The intercept or milit ary craf t communicat es by] Rocking wings from a posit ion slight ly above and ahead of, and normally to the left of, the intercept ed aircraf t.... This act ion conveys the message: \"You have been intercept ed. \" The commercial jet is then supposed to respond by rocking its wings to indicat e compliance, upon which the intercept or perf orms a \"slow level turn, normally to the left, on to the desired heading [direct ion] .\" The commercial plane then responds by following the escort . > 7 If Flight 11 had been thus intercept ed but did not respond, it would, according to standard procedures, have been shot down. Marine Corps Major Mike Snyder, a NORAD spokesman, after telling the Bost on Globe that NORAD's \"fight ers rout inely intercept aircraf t,\" cont inued: When planes are intercept ed, they typically are handled wit h graduat ed response. The approaching fight er may rock its wingt ips to attract the pilot s attent ion, or make a pass in front of the aircraf t. Event ually, it can fire tracer rounds in the airplanes pat h, or, under cert ain circumst ances, down it wit h a missile. > 8 The quest ion raised by crit ics, of course, is why this did not happen in the case of Flight 11. Why was the plane not even intercept ed ? Some conf usion about this mat ter, they point out , was creat ed by VicePresident Cheney during an interview on \"Meet the Press\" on Sept ember16, in which he suggest ed that the \"quest ion of whet her or not we would intercept commercial aircraf t,\" as well as the quest ion of whet her it would be shot down, was \"a president ial-level decision. \" This statement , point out the crit ics, conf uses two mat ters: intercept ing and shoot ing down, and intercept ion is a rout ine mat ter, which occurs well over a hundred times a year. > 9 The conf usion of these two mat ters was also aided by General Richard Myers, then Act ing Chairman of the Joint Chief s of Staff, > 10 in test imony to the Senat e Armed Services Commit tee on Sept ember 13, in which he stated: \"[A}f ter the second tower was hit, I spoke to the commander of NORAD, General Eberhart . And at that point , I think the decision was at that point to start launching aircraf t.\" > 11 He, like Cheney, implied that fight ers would be sent up to intercept flight s only if ordered to by commanders at the highest level. But intercept ion occurs rout inely, as a mat ter of standard operat ing procedure, even if shoot ing down a plane would be, as Cheney implied, \"a president ial-level decision. \" Moreover, although some researchers have accept ed the view that a hijacked plane could be shot down only wit h president ial aut horizat ion, > 12 Thierry Meyssan point s out that the milit ary regulat ions seem to say otherwise. According to these regulat ions,"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"In the event of a hijacking, the NMCC [Nat ional Milit ary Command Cent er] will be not ified by the most expedit ious means by the FAA. The NMCC will, wit h the except ion of request s needing an immediat e response — forward request s for DoD [Depart ment of Def ense] assist ance to the Secret ary of Def ense for approval. > 13 Accordingly, concludes Meyssan, the regulat ions give the responsibilit y for shoot ing down hijacked airplanes \"to the Secret ary of Def ense. \" Furt hermore, as the phrase beginning \"wit h the except ion\" shows, if the Secret ary of Def ense cannot be cont act ed in time, other people in the line of command would have the aut horit y. According to a Depart ment of Def ense document cited by Meyssan: It is possible to formulat e to any element in the chain of command \"Request s needing Immediat e Response. \" These arise from imminent ly serious condit ions where only an immediat e act ion taken by an official of the Depart ment of Def ense or a milit ary commander can prevent loss of lives, or mit igat e human suf fering and great propert y damage. > 14 According to this reading, many people in the line of command would have had the aut horit y to prevent the \"loss of lives\" and \"great propert y damage\" that occurred when AA Flight 11 slammed into the Nort h Tower of the WTC. One might argue, to be sure, that at that time no one would have known that the plane was going to do that . But , crit ics of the official account would reply, that argument — besides not explaining why Flight 11 was not at least intercept ed — would not apply to the second plane to crash into the WTC. Uni ted Airlines Flight 175 UA Flight 175 left Bost on at 8:14 AM, which was just when the FAA was learning that Flight 11 may have been hijacked. At 8:42, its radio and transponder went off and it veered off course. Knowing by then that the earlier flight had def init ely been hijacked and was flying across New York Cit y, FAA officials would surely have been ready to cont act the milit ary immediat ely. They, in fact , report edly not ified NORAD at 8:43. > 15 NORAD should have had fight er jets intercept ing this plane by 8:53. And by this time, being 7 minut es after the first hijacked plane had hit the WTC, the fight ers cert ainly should have been ready to shoot down this second hijacked plane if it did not immediat ely follow orders. Inst ead, however, no planes intercept ed Flight 175, and it crashed into the WTC's Sout h Tower at 9:03. Anot her dist urbing feat ure about this crash, especially to the families of the vict ims, is that at 8:55, a public announcement was report edly broadcast inside the Sout h Tower, saying that the building was secure, so that people could ret urn to their offices. Such announcement s report edly cont inued unt il a few minut es bef ore the building was hit, and may have cont ribut ed \"to the deat hs of hundreds of people. \" > 16 Paul Thompson asks: \"Given that at 8:43 NORAD was not ified Flight 175 was hijacked and headed toward New York Cit y, why weren't people in the building warned ?\" A dist urbing quest ion, since Thompson's implicat ion seems to be that perhaps someone other than the hijackers was seeking to ensure that a signif icant number of lives were lost . In any case, given the fact that this plane hit the WTC 17 minut es after the first crash, none of the reasons that could be imagined to explain why standard procedures broke down wit h regard to the first plane — such as inat tent ive air traf fic cont rollers, pilot s at milit ary bases not on full alert , or the assumpt ion that the plane's aberrant behavior did not mean that it had been hijacked — could be used to explain why Flight 175 was not shot down or even intercept ed. For one thing, by then all the technicians at NORAD's Nort heast Air Def ense Sect or \"had their headset s linked to the FAA in Bost on to hear about Flight 11, \" so NORAD would have been fully aware of the seriousness of the situat ion. > 17 Even more puzzling is why in anot her 35 minut es, at 9:38, the Pent agon would be hit, but we will wait unt il the next chapt er to examine this third flight . The present task is to consider the official account of the first two flight s and the response of the crit ics. Why Were Flights 11 and 175 Not Intercepted ? One of the strange things about the official account , say its crit ics, is that there has been more than one version of it. General Myers, in his aforement ioned test imony to the Senat e Armed Services Commit tee on Sept ember 13, said: \"When it became clear what the threat was, we did scramble fight er aircraf t.\" When asked whet her that order was given \"bef ore or after the Pent agon was struck, \" Myers — who was act ing chairman of the Joint Chief s of Staff — replied: \"That order, to the best of my knowledge, was after the Pent agon was struck. \" > 18 One problem wit h this statement , point out crit ics, is that officials at NMCC would have become clear about \"what the threat was\" long bef ore the Pent agon itself was hit at 9:38. It would have been clear at least by 8:46, when the WTC was hit and anot her hijacked plane was heading in its direct ion. Anot her problem, of course, is that it was not necessary for officials at NMCC and NORAD to underst and fully \"what the threat was\" in order for there to be jets in the air to intercept Flight s 11, 175, and"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"any unaut horized aircraf t headed toward Washingt on. Standard operat ing procedures should have taken care of all those things. This version of the official account was also told by at least two other officials. According to a story in the Bost on Globe on Sept ember 15, Major Mike Snyder, speaking for NORAD, said that no fight ers were scrambled unt il after the Pent agon was hit. And on Sept ember 16, when Tim Russert , during his aforement ioned interview wit h Vice President Cheney on \"Meet the Press, \" expressed surprise that although we knew about the first hijacking by 8:20, \"it seems we were not able to scramble fight er jets in time to prot ect the Pent agon, \" Cheney did not disput e this statement . > 19 The major problem wit h this first version of the official account , of course, is that it says that milit ary behavior complet ely cont radict ed standard procedures, which call for jets to be scrambled as soon as a suspect ed hijacking is report ed. Despit e the fact that statement s by Myers and Cheney seemed to suggest otherwise, it requires no command from on high for fight er jets to be scrambled. Rat her, the crit ics point out , an order for them not to be scrambled is what would require a command from on high. For example, Illarion Bykov and Jared Israel, comment ing on the fact that the standard emergency syst ems failed on 9/11, say: \"This could only happen if individuals in high posit ions worked in a coordinat ed way to make them fail. \" > 20 Wit hin a few days, in any case, NORAD began saying that it did have planes scrambled but they arrived too late. > 21 To the crit ics, however, this second version seems almost as strange as the first . According to this version, NORAD was not not ified by the FAA of the hijacking of Flight 11 unt il 8:40. This would have been 26 minut es after the plane's radio and transponder went off and 20 minut es after it went off course. Allan Wood and Paul Thompson writ e: Is NORAD's claim credible ? If so, the air traf fic cont rollers. ..should have been fired and subject to possible criminal charges for their inact ion. To dat e, however, there has been no word of any person being disciplined. ... If NORAD's claim is false, and it was indeed informed wit hin the time frame out lined in FAA regulat ions. .., that would mean NORAD did absolut ely not hing for almost thirt y minut es while a hijacked commercial airliner flew off course through some of the most congest ed airspace in the world. Presumably, that would warrant some very serious charges. Again, no one associat ed wit h NORAD or the FAA has been punished. > 22 The lack of disciplinary act ion suggest s either that this story is false or that the relevant part ies at FAA and/ or NORAD did what they had been inst ruct ed to do. This account has more anomalous feat ures. After NORAD received word of the hijacking, according to this account , it did not give the scramble order unt il 8:46, six minut es after it had been not ified. Furt hermore, NORAD inexplicably gave this order not to McGuire Air Force Base in New Jersey, which is only 70 miles from NYC, but to Otis Air Nat ional Guard Base in Cape Cod, which is over 180 miles away. That would have made no difference wit h regard to Flight 11, of coursebecause 8:46 was when it was striking the WTC. In the meant ime, however, NORAD says that it had received not ificat ion at 8:43 from the FAA of Flight 175's hijacking, so the two F-15 s that were given the scramble order at 8:46 were sent after this flight inst ead. But , inexplicably, the F-15 s are said not to have taken off unt il 6 minut es later, at 8:52. However, perhaps the strangest feat ure of this story, from the viewpoint of the crit ics, involves its failure to explain, even wit h all those delays, why the planes did not arrive in time to stop the second attack on the WTC. At 8:52, there were still 11 minut es unt il 9:03, when Flight 175 would hit the second tower. Lieut enant Colonel Timot hy Duf fy, a pilot said to have flown one of the F- 15s, has been quot ed as stating that he \"was in full-blower all the way, \" which would mean he was going over 1,875 nmph. > 23 At this speed, the F-15 s would have been covering over 30 miles a minut e. Hence, allowing the standard 2.5 minut es for them to get airborne and up to speed, they should have reached Manhat tan in about 8 minut es, having a full 3 minut es left to shoot down the errant airliner. And yet , according to this second version of the official account , the F-15 s were still 70 miles away when Flight 175 crashed into the Sout h Tower. > 24 Indeed, according to NORAD's timeline, it took them 19 minut es to reach the city. So, if the story about jets from Otis is even true, they must have been traveling at far less than \"full blower\" — in fact , if we accept NORAD s timeline, more like 700 mph. > 25 Furt hermore, even if the times in this story are adjust ed enough to account for the fact that the planes were late, there is still the quest ion of why the order was not given to McGuire Air Force Base. As Ahmed says, an F-15 flying at 1,850 nmph \"would cover the ground from New Jersey's"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Air Force Base to New York in under 3 minut es, and thus could have easily intercept ed Flight 175. \" > 26 So, the crit ics conclude, even if this second story is accept ed, the WTC's second tower should not have been hit. Finally, the claim that jets were scrambled to try to stop this second hijacked plane still leaves us wit h no explanat ion as to why standard procedures were not followed wit h regard to the first one. Accept ing this second version of the official account would, furt hermore, leave us puzzled as to how General Myers, Vice President Cheney, and the NORAD spokesman could have at first believed that no planes what soever had been scrambled unt il after the Pent agon had been hit. Accordingly, some crit ics, including some wit h milit ary experience, think that the second version was fabricat ed. For example, Stan Gof f, a ret ired Mast er Sergeant who taught Milit ary Science at West Point , concludes that no Air Force jets were scrambled unt il after the Pent agon was hit. > 27 Andreas von Bülow, former State Secret ary in the German Def ense Minist ry, said: \"For 60 decisive minut es, the milit ary and intelligence agencies let the fight er planes stay on the ground. \" > 28 Under either version of the official account , in any case, the successf ul attacks on the WTC should not have been possible. This view is support ed by Anat oli Kornukov, the commander in chief of the Russian Air Force, who was quot ed the day after 9/11 as saying: \"Generally it is impossible to carry out an act of terror on the scenario which was used in the USA yest erday. ... As soon as somet hing like that happens here, I am report ed about that right away and in a minut e we are all up. \" > 29 After quot ing Kornukovs statement , Ahmed comment s: \"It is, of course, well known that the US Air Force is far superior to Russia's, \" adding that some reasonable inferences can be drawn from these fact s — in part icular, that the attacks on the WTC could have happened only if standard operat ing procedures were suspended. Standard Operat ing Procedures (SOP) were complet ely and inexplicably dropped on 11 th Sept ember — somet hing that had never occurred bef ore. The quest ion then remains as to who was responsible for ensuring that rout ine emergency response rules were not adhered to. > 30 Bykov and Israel have little doubt about who that was, saying: The sabot age of rout ine prot ect ive syst ems, cont rolled by strict hierarchies, would never have been cont emplat ed let alone attempt ed absent the involvement of the supreme US milit ary command. This includes at least US President George Bush, US Secret ary of Def ense Donald Rumsf eld and the then -Act ing Head of the Joint Chief s of Staff, Air Force General Richard B. Myers. > 31 This is indeed the quest ion that must be faced: Could a plan to hijack airplanes and crash them into the WTC have been successf ul wit hout \"st and down\" orders approved by Bush, Rumsf eld, and Myers ? As the conclusions drawn by crit ics of the official account of Flight s 11 and 175 show, this account has evoked dist urbing quest ions. > 32 Furt her dist urbing quest ions have been raised by the collapse of the buildings of the World Trade Cent er. > 33 The Col lapse of the WTC Bui ldings According to the official account , the Nort h and Sout h Towers (the Twin Towers) collapsed due to the impact of the airliners plus the intense heat produced by the result ing fires. Calling this the \"of ficial account ,\" I should add, does not mean that it has been endorsed by any official body. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) was given the task of invest igat ing the collapse, but when it issued its report in May of 2002, it declared that \"the sequence of event s leading to the collapse of each tower could not be def init ively det ermined. \" > 34 Nevert heless, FEMA's report was filled wit h speculat ion that served to support the official theory. This theory is widely reject ed by those familiar wit h the fact s. It was reject ed already in January of 2002 in an art icle by Bill Manning ent itled \"Selling Out the Invest igat ion, \" which was published in Fire Engineering, a trade magazine wit h ties to the New York Fire Depart ment . Manning report ed that a growing number of fire prot ect ion engineers had suggest ed that \"the struct ural damage from the planes and the explosive ignit ion of jet fuel in themselves were not enough to bring down the towers. \" > 35 In the meant ime, many more object ions to the official theory have been raised. Some of these object ions involve special problems associat ed wit h the collapse of a third building in the complex known as Building 7 (WTC -7). To evaluat e these object ions, it is necessary to review some of the fact s. The Nort h Tower (WTC - 1) was struck at 8:46 AM. It collapsed one hour and 42 minut es later, at 10: 28. The Sout h Tower (WTC -2) was struck at 9:03 AM. It collapsed 56 minut es later, at 9:59. Building Number 7 (WTC - 7), which was two blocks away and was not struck, collapsed at 5:20 PM. These fact s immediat ely suggest two quest ions: Why did the Sout h Tower, which was struck 17 minut es later"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"than the Nort h Tower, nevert heless collapse 29 minut es earlier ? And why did WTC -7 collapse at all, given the fact that it was not struck ? Addit ional det ails about the collapse of these three buildings raise even more quest ions. I will first deal wit h quest ions that have been raised about the Nort h and Sout h Towers, then turn to WTC -7. The Twin Towers: According one account that became widely circulat ed short ly after 9/11 by being art iculat ed on a NOVA program, the Nort h and Sout h Towers were caused to collapse when the heat of the fires, fed by the jet fuel, melt ed the buildings' steel columns. > 36 It is now universally agreed, however, that the fires would not have been nearly hot enough. To melt steel, one needs a temperat ure in the range of 2,770° F (1, 500° C), which can be produced only by some special device, such as an oxyacet yline torch. A hydrocarbon fire, such as one based on ref ined kerosene — which is what jet fuel is — does not get nearly that hot . As explained by Thomas Eagar, prof essor of mat erials engineering and engineering syst ems at MI T, the maximum possible temperat ure for an open fire fueled by hydrocarbons would be 1,600 to 1,700° F. Moroever, since the WTC fires were fuel -rich fires, as evidenced by the fact that they gave off much black smoke, they were not even very hot for hydrocarbon fires, \"probably only 1,200 or 1,300° F.\" > 37 As the melt ing theory illust rat es, some of the widely accept ed explanat ions of the collapse of the towers are unsound scient ifically. Many other theories are inadequat e because they do not take account of specif ic fact s about the buildings and the nat ure of the collapses. Bef ore examining any more theories, theref ore, we should look at some of these fact s. Each of the towers was about 1,300 feet tall. To support these ext remely tall buildings, there were 47 steel columns in the cent ral core of each building and 240 steel columns around the perimet er, wit h each column being far thicker at the bot tom than at the top. The perimet er columns were connect ed to the core by means of steel bar -joist trusses in the concret e floors. Alt hough there has been considerable talk of \"flimsy trusses, \" > 38 Scient ific American quot ed engineer Robert McNamara as saying \"nowadays, they just don't build them as tough as the World Trade Cent er. \" Wit h regard to the bar -joist trusses in part icular, the FEMA report said: \"The floor framing syst em for the two towers was complex and subst ant ially more redundant than typical bar joist floor syst ems. \" > 39 Invest igat ions of some recovered steel have found, furt hermore, that far from being def ect ive, it met or even exceeded the standard requirement s. > 40 Given these fact s about the towers, we can dismiss a second idea that has been widely promulgat ed, namely, that the impact of the airplanes would have subst ant ially weakened the towers. Thomas Eagar says that the impact of the airplanes would have been insignif icant , because \"the number of columns lost on the init ial impact was not large and the loads were shif ted to remaining columns in this highly redundant struct ure. \" > 41 [W] ithin a few dozen seconds after the plane crash, \" Eric Huf schmid point s out , \"[t]he Nort h tower was quiet , stable, and mot ionless. \" > 42 Those who support the official account , such as Eagar himself , generally argue that the collapses must be explained in terms of the heat from the fires. In Eagar's words: \"The real damage in the World Trade Cent er result ed from the size of the fire. \" Because the steel used in buildings must be able to hold five times its normal load, Eagar point s out , the steel in the towers could have collapsed only if it was heat ed to the point at which it \"lost 80 percent of its strengt h,\" which would be about 1,300 F. Eagar believes that this is what happened. > 43 The credibilit y of the official theory, accordingly, depends at least in part on whet her there is evidence that the towers had the requisit e fires. To evaluat e this issue we must acknowledge the dist inct ion, emphasized by Eagar himself , bet ween temperat ure and heat (or energy). > 44 Somet hing, such as a burning mat ch or light bulb, can have a very high temperat ure but not generat e much heat (energy), because it is so small. A burning mat ch would never bring a steel beam up to its temperat ure. A 1,300 F fire would bring a huge steel beam up to this temperat ure only if it were a very big fire, so that it had lots of energy. There is one more condit ion: The big fire would have to be applied to the steel beam for a considerable period of time. For the official theory to be credible, theref ore, the fires in the towers must have been moderat ely hot ; they must have been large fires, spreading throughout the buildings; and they must have burned for a considerable lengt h of time. All the available evidence, however, suggest s that the opposit e was the case. A most valuable book for examining this evidence is Eric Huf schmid's Painf ul Quest ions, > 45 which cont ains the best set of phot ographs available. The Twin Towers have commonly been described as \"towering infernos. \" From the point of view of human bodies, this was a true descript ion of the Nort h Tower, from which many people leaped to their deat h to avoid the smoke and flames in the floors above the 96 th floor, where the airplane hit. There is a huge difference, however, bet ween the tolerance of human bodies and that of steel. Phot ographs of the Nort h Tower provide no evidence of any fire that could have weakened its steel signif icant ly. A phot ograph taken wit hin 16 minut es of when the Nort h Tower was hit (because the Sout h Tower had not yet been hit) shows only a dark hole wit h black smoke pouring"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"out of it. No flames arc visible. As Huf schmidt point s out : \"The lack of flames is an indicat ion that the fires were small, and the dark smoke is an indicat ion that the fires were suf focat ing. \" > 46 Anot her phot o, taken from anot her angle just after the Sout h Tower was hit, shows some flames on floors just above the point of impact but no others. However great the flames may have been in the first several minut es, while they were being fed by the jet fuel, this skyscraper was not a towering inferno by the time 16 minut es had passed. > 47 We have all, of course, seen pict ures of a huge fireball out side the Sout h Tower. > 48 There was also a fireball out side the Nort h Tower after it was hit. > 49 These fireballs were creat ed by the burning of the jet fuel that was spilled. The Sout h Tower had a far bigger fireball because it was hit near a corner, so more fuel was spilled out side. These fireballs generat ed a great amount of heat . But it was moment ary, because the fuel was quickly burned up. > 50 The fact that the Sout h Towers fireball was bigger, furt hermore, does not mean that the Sout h Towers fires were bigger. To the cont rary. Because so much jet fuel was burned up wit hin the first few minut es, there was less to feed the fire inside the building. As Huf schmid report s, \"phot os show the spect acular flames vanished quickly, and then the fire remained rest rict ed to one area of the tower. ..[and] slowly diminished\" > 51 The fact s about the fire, theref ore, seem to rule out any version of the official account according to which each tower had hot , widespread, long -last ing fires. Insof ar as there were hot fires, they were localized and of short durat ion. Such fires, even if they were 1,300° F, could not have brought much if any steel up to that temperat ure. > 52 Anot her count against the fire theory is the likelihood that , even if the Twin Towers had been engulf ed in raging fires, they would not have collapsed. Prior to the alleged except ions of 9/11, a steel -framed building had never bef ore collapsed solely because of fire. As a report by FEMA in 1991 stated about a fire in a Philadelphia building that year, the fire was so energet ic that \"[b]eams and girders sagged and twist ed, \" but \"[d]espit e this ext raordinary exposure, the columns cont inued to support their loads wit hout obvious damage. \" > 53 Def enders of the fire theory, however, appeal to the special charact erist ics of the Twin Towers. Given these special charact erist ics, they cont end, the fire did not have to heat all me steel by spreading throughout all the floors. According to Thomas Eagar, it was suf ficient to have a hot fire that covered one floor. The culprit s, he says, were the angle dips, \" which \"held the floor joist s bet ween the columns on the perimet er wall and the core struct ure, \" and which, he says, were not designed to hold five times their normal load. > 54 Art iculat ing what crit ics call the \"zipper\" version of the truss theory, Eagar says: \"Once you start ed to get angle clips to fail in one area, it put ext ra load on other angle clips, and then it unzipped around the building on that floor in a mat ter of seconds. \" > 55 And then: As the joist s on one or two of the most heavily burned floors gave way and the out er box columns began to bow out ward, the floors above them also fell. The floor below (wit h its 1300 - ton design capacit y) could not support the roughly 45, 000 tons of ten floors (or more) above crashing down on these angle clips. This start ed the domino effect that caused the buildings to collapse wit hin ten seconds. > 56 Somet hing like this theory was endorsed in the FEMA report , which spoke of \"a pancake -type of collapse of successive floors. \" > 57 There are, however, many problems wit h this account . First , even this more modest view of the amount of steel that had to become very hot would seem to require more heat than was present , especially in the Sout h Tower. Second, as Huf schmid point s out : \"In order for a floor to fall, hundreds of joint s had to break almost simult aneously on 236 ext erior columns and 47 core columns. \" > 58 Third, Eagar means his theory to do just ice to the fact that the towers collapsed \"wit hin ten seconds. \" For a 1,300 - foot building, however, ten seconds is almost free -fall speed. But if each floor produced just a little resist ance, so that breaking through each one took a half second, the collapse of all those floors — 80 or 95 of them — would have taken 40 to 47 seconds. Can we really believe that the upper part of the buildings encount ered virt ually no resist ance from the lower part s? > 59 The problem would be even worse in relat ion to the Nort h Tower, at least if Huf schmid is right to say that it fell in eight seconds, which would be exact ly free -fall speed \"How, \" he asks, \"could the debris crush 100 steel and concret e floors while falling as fast as object s fall through air ?\" > 60 Fourt h, Eagar's theory, like all other versions of the official account cannot do just ice to the fact that the collapse of the towers was total, result ing in a pile of rubble that , in Eagars own words, \"was only a few stories high. \" > 61 Even if one grant ed that his theory might explain why the floors and out er columns collapsed, it docs not explain, argues Pet er Meyer, the collapse of the massive steel columns in the core of the buildings:"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Why were the lower part s of the massive support ing steel columns not left standing after the collapse ? If the official story is true, that the damage was caused by the impact s and fires, which occurred only in the upper floors, and that the floors then pancaked, one would expect the massive steel columns in the cent ral core, for, say, the lowest 20 or 30 floors, to have remained standing. > 62 Still anot her fact about the collapse of the towers that count s against the fire theory is the fact , ment ioned at the out set , that the Sout h Tower collapsed first . As we saw, it would take considerable time for fire to heat steel up to its own temperat ure. All other things being equal, then, the tower that was struck first should have collapsed first . And yet , although the Sout h Tower was struck 17 minut es later than the Nort h Tower, it collapsed 29 minut es earlier. This surprising fact would perhaps not creat e a problem if the fire in the Sout h Tower had been much bigger. As we have seen, however, the fire in the Sout h Tower was act ually much smaller. Upon hearing that one tower took almost twice as long as the other one, theref ore, one would assume that that was the Sout h Tower. And yet the opposit e was the case. This complet e reversal of expect ations suggest s that the collapse of these buildings was caused by somet hing other than the fires. > 63 And that is, of course, what the crit ics maint ain. Their alternat ive explanat ion is that the collapse was an example of a cont rolled demolit ion, based on explosives that had been placed throughout the building. This theory, point out its advocat es, can explain all the fact s discussed thus far. Wit h regard to why the collapse was total and so rapid, Meyer says that this is underst andable if the bases of the steel columns were dest royed by explosions at the level of the bedrock. Wit h those bases oblit erat ed, and the support ing steel columns shat tered by explosions at various levels in the Twin Towers, the upper floors lost all support and collapsed to ground level in about ten seconds. > 64 Also, the cont rolled demolit ion theory, in conjunct ion wit h the fact that the Sout h Tower was struck near the corner, can account for the otherwise surprising order in which the two towers collapsed. In bot h cases the fires wit hin the buildings died down after awhile, giving off only black, soot y smoke. If the Twin Towers were deliberat ely demolished, and the intent ion was to blame the collapse on the fires. .. then the latest time at which the towers could be collapsed would be just as the fires were dying down. Since the fire in the Sout h Tower result ed from the combust ion of less fuel than the fire in the Nort h Tower, the fire in the Sout h Tower began to go out earlier than the fire in the Nort h Tower. Those cont rolling the demolit ion thus had to collapse the Sout h Tower bef ore they collapsed the Nort h Tower. > 65 There are, furt hermore, some addit ional fact s about the collapse of the Twin Towers that seem explainable only by the demolit ion theory. One of these is the fact that each collapse produced a lot of fine dust or powder, which upon analysis proved to consist primarily of gypsum and concret e. > 66 Jef f King, examining the official account in light of what the videos show, says: [T]he biggest and most obvious problem that I see is the source of the enormous amount of very fine dust that we see generat ed during the collapse. ... Where does the energy come from to turn all this reinf orced concret e into dust ? > 67 And as Huf shmid adds, phot os of the rubble show only \"a few small pieces of concret e,\" which means that \"[v]irtually every piece of concret e shat tered into dust .\" As a result , \"Perhaps 100, 000 tons of concret e in each tower was pulverized to a powder. This required a lot of energy. \" > 68 What is especially problemat ic, King suggest s, is how much very fine concret e dust is eject ed from the top or the building very early in the collapse. Since it should at most be accelerat ing under gravit y at 32 feet per second, things would act ually be moving quit e slowly at first .... It is very hard to imagine a physical mechanism to generat e that much dust wit h concret e slabs bumping into each other at 20 or 30 mph. > 69 Huf schmid point s out , moreover, that even concret e slabs hitting the ground at free -fall speed would not be pulverized. \"In order to pulverise concret e into powder, explosives must be used. \" > 70 The use of explosives is perhaps even more strongly suggest ed by anot her feat ure of the collapses, alluded to in King's second statement , namely, that when the towers start ed to collapse, they did not fall straight down, as the pancake theory holds. They exploded. The powder was eject ed horizont ally from the buildings wit h such force that the buildings were surrounded by enormous dust clouds that were perhaps three times the widt h of the buildings themselves. The phot ographs in Huf schmid's book are especially valuable for helping one grasp this"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"overwhelmingly impressive and import ant fact . > 71 What other than explosives could turn concret e into powder and then eject it horizont ally 150 feet or more ? And if it be suspect ed that the dust simply float ed out , some of the phot ographs show that rat her large pieces of the tower were also thrown out 150 feet or more. > 72 Anot her start ling feat ure of the collapse would have required still more energy. Besides powdery dust , the other major component of the rubble was, as would be expect ed, steel. But the steel was in short sect ions. \"Almost every piece of steel in bot h towers broke at the joint s.\" > 73 The cont rolled demolit ion theory is given addit ional support by the fact that some people, including some firemen, report ed hearing explosions, feeling explosions, or wit nessing effect s that appeared to be result s of explosions, bot h in the intermediat e floors and in the subbasement s of the Towers. > 74 Still more support is provided by seismic evidence that a moderat ely powerf ul eart hquake was recorded as each tower was collapsing. The seismographs at Columbia Universit y's Lamont - Dohert y Eart h Observat ory in Palisades, New York, 21 miles nort h of the WTC, recorded a 2.1 magnit ude eart hquake beginning at 9:59: 04, then a 2.3 quake beginning at 10: 28: 31. > 75 In each case, \"the shocks increased during the first 5 seconds then dropped abrupt ly to a lower level for about 3 seconds, and then slowly tapered off.\" This pat tern, Huf schmid suggest s, ref lect s the fact that the first explosives det onat ed were those near the tops of the towers, where the steel columns were the thinnest . The shocks get stronger as the det onat ion pat tern, cont rolled by a comput er program, worked its way down. The final explosions at the base of the tower and in the basement had to break joint s on columns made from 100 mm thick steel, so they were powerf ul explosives. The seismic dat a peaked when the explosives in the basement were det onat ed. Then the explosions stopped and the rubble cont inued to fall for anot her couple of seconds, result ing in small seismic tremors. > 76 The demolit ion theory is furt her support ed by report s that molt en steel was found at the level of the subbasement s. The president of Cont rolled Demolit ion, Inc. (in Phoenix, Maryland), Mark Loizeaux, who wrot e the clean -up plan for the ent ire operat ion, has been quot ed as saying that in the third, fourt h, and fifth weeks, the clean -up crew found \"hot spot s of molt en steel. ..at the bot toms of the elevat or shaf ts of the main towers, down seven [basement ] levels. \" > 77 Besides explaining the exist ence of the widely report ed hot spot s, which kept smoldering for weeks, > 78 the theory that explosives had been set could explain an otherwise inexplicable fact — that after the collapse of the towers, the debris, induding the steel, was quickly removed bef ore there could be any signif icant invest igat ion. The New York Times complained, saying: \"The decision to rapidly recycle the steel columns, beams and trusses from the WTC in the days immediat ely after 9/11 means def init ive answers may never be known. \" The next week, the aforement ioned essay in Fire Engineering said: \"The dest ruct ion and removal of evidence must stop immediat dy. \" > 79 But it went ahead at full speed. > 80 Explaining the possible signif icance of this feet , Meyer point s out that [a] way to prove that the support ing steel columns of the Twin Towers had been blast ed by explosives would be to examine fragment s from them among the debris for evidence of what met allurgist s call \"twinning. \" But the WTC debris was removed as fast as possible and no forensic examinat ion of the debris was permit ted. ... Almost all the 300, 000 tons of steel from the Twin Towers was sold to New York scrap dealers and export ed to places like China and Korea as quickly as it could be loaded ont o the ships, thereby removing the evidence. > 81 Why this hast e, crit ics wonder, unless the government had somet hing to hide ? > 82 WTC -7: Alt hough the collapse of this 47 - story building is generally ignored or discussed simply as an aftert hought , it is in many respect s the most puzzling. Because it was not struck by an airplane, the main ingredient s in the typical explanat ions of the collapse of the Twin Towers cannot be employed. There is, in fact , no official explanat ion. The FEMA report provided a lot of speculat ion about what might have happened, but provided no consensus statement about what act ually did happen. > 83 The report by the House Science Commit tee also provided no explanat ion. > 84 But insof ar as there is an account that is widely accept ed in official and media circles, it goes somet hing like this. Alt hough Building 7 -- which was 355 feet away from the Nort h Tower and still fart her from the Sout h Tower — was not hit by any signif icant amount of falling debris, enough debris did cross over to start a fire. Then besides the fact that the fire chief decided, for some unknown reason, not to have his crew ent er this building, the sprinkler syst em (inexplicably) failed to put out this little fire, and it grew unt il it was raging. It then came into cont act wit h the thousands of gallons of diesel fuel stored on the ground floor. The result ing fire then became so hot that it caused the building's steel reinf orcement to collapse at 5:20 PM. This theory faces many problems. First , there is no evidence of any raging fire. \"Every phot o"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"taken of building 7,\" Huf schmid report s, \"shows only a few tiny fires in only a few windows, \" primarily on the 7 th and 12 th floors. > 85 Second, there is again the problem of how a hydrocarbon fire, even had it been raging, could have caused the collapse, especially since Buildings 4, 5, and 6 did have raging fires but did not collapse. > 86 In this case, moreover, the collapse could not be part ly explained by the impact and fuel of an airplane, so WTC -7 would be the first steel -framedbuilding in hist ory to collapse solely from fire damage. > 87 If such a thing really happened on 9/11, crit ics point out , this would be an event of overwhelming import ance. Everyt hing that archit ect s and building engineers have long assumed about steel -framed buildings would need to be ret hought . Insurance companies around the world would need to recalculat e all their rat es on the basis of the realizat ion that ordinary fires could cause steel -framed buildings to collapse. And so on. And yet the idea that WTC -7 collapsed because of fire has been accept ed as if it were not hing unusual. In an essay ent ided \"WTC -7: The Improbable Collapse, \" Scot t Loughrey says: FEMAs nonchalance about WTC -7 s collapse is stunning. Struct ural failures of this magnit ude do not normally take place. ... [Do] we now live in an era when tall steel buildings can collapse in large cities wit hout any signif icant discussion of why ? > 88 Third, there are several feat ures that would be difficult for the official theory because they suggest cont rolled demolit ion. Indeed, Huf schmit emphasizes, the collapse of WTC -7, unlike that of the Twin Towers, suggest s a typical demolit ion, because \"Building 7 collapsed at its bot tom. \" When Building 7 collapsed, the interior fell first , and that caused the out side of the building to move inward. ... The result was a very tiny pile of rubble, wit h the out side of the building collapsing on top of the pile. This is how convent ional demolit ions operat e. > 89 A signif icant amount of powdery dust was also produced, although in this case there was not as much dust and most of it was produced at the ground, where this collapse began, inst ead of in the air. > 90 Seismic vibrat ions were regist ered at the time of the collapse, although they were only one tent h the magnit ude of those associat ed wit h the other towers, and there were two hot spot s in the rubble from this collapse, one of which was ext remely hot . > 91 Molt en steel was also report edly found at this site. > 92 Finally, the steel was quickly removed from this site as well, and wit h even less just ificat ion, for the building had long since been evacuat ed, so there was no need to search for survivors, as there had been at the Twin Towers. So what possible just ificat ion was there for the dest ruct ion of forensic evidence — which is generally considered a serious crime ? In conclusion, I ret urn to the point that the FEMA report act ually gave no explanat ion. It inst ead said: The specif ics of the fires in WTC 7 and how they caused the building to collapse remain unknown at this time. Alt hough the total diesel fuel on the premises cont ained massive pot ent ial energy, the best hypot hesis has only a low probabilit y of occurrence. > 93 It must be recognized, however, that FEMA had been given an impossible assignment — to explain the collapse of this building while remaining wit hin the framework of the official theory. Not being able to suggest that the collapse result ed from a cont rolled demolit ion, the best FEMA could come up wit h was a theory having \"only a low probabilit y.\" The same underst anding must be applied to Thomas Eagar and all the other expert s who have present ed highly improbable explanat ions of the collapse of the Twin Towers. If polit ical correct ness were not a fact or so that they could simply state the most probable hypot hesis, given the evidence, most of them would surely choose cont rolled demolit ion. For example, Mat thys Levy, who suggest ed that the towers fell because their steel melt ed, also said: \"It was very much like a cont rolled demolit ion when you look at it.\" > 94 If it was indeed a cont rolled demolit ion, of course, that would mean that the terrorist s were able to succeed in their mission to bring down the World Trade Cent er only because it was an inside job. ====== The quest ions raised about the official account s of Flight 77, Flight 175, and the collapse of Buildings 1,2, and 7 of the World Trade Cent er do not necessarily point to president ial complicit y. But they do seem to point to official complicit y at some level. Alt hough the evidence that the collapse of the WTC was an inside job might mean that it was planned by pri vate part ies, the fact that the federal government allowed forensic evidence to be removed suggest s at least the first possible view ment ioned in the Introduct ion: official complicit y in a cover -up. But then this first view — according to which no US officials played a role in facilit ating the attacks — seems to be ruled out by the evidence relat ed to Flight s 11 and 175, which seems to require involvement by at least the Pent agon's NMCC and NORAD. The evidence about the flight s also seems to rule out"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"the second possible view, according to which no US agencies had any specif ic knowledge of the attacks in advance. The attacks on the WTC, it would seem, could not have succeeded unless some US officials had given \"st and down\" orders for standard operat ing procedures to be canceled on that part icular day. And, although this might be taken to mean the fifth possible view, according to which the Pent agon gave those orders, it would be difficult to believe that such orders could have been given wit hout Whit e House approval. Examinat ions of the official account of the attacks on the WTC in relat ion to various relevant fact s have, in any case, raised dist urbing quest ions. Furt her dist urbing quest ions have been evoked, moreover, by tensions bet ween the fact s and the official account s of the other flight s.

One or these is whet her the airplanes that crashed into the towers were really being flown by hijackers, or were inst ead being guided by remot e cont rol, perhaps using the Global Hawk technology developed by the Def ense Depart ment , which has been funct ioning at least since 1997 and enables an airplane to fly itself , from takeof f through landing (Thompson, \"Timeline, \" 1998 [A] and April 23, 2001). Meyssan believes that this is likely, part ly because he considers it improbable that amat eur pilot s could have hit those relat ively narrow target s so accurat ely wit h Boeing airliners, which have low maneuverabilit y. He finds this especially improbable wit h regard to Flight 175, which \"was forced to execut e a complex rot ation maneuver, part icularly difficult facing the wind. \" Prof essional pilot s he consult ed, he report s, \"conf irmed that few amongst themselves could envisage perf orming such an operat ion and complet ely ruled it out in the case of amat eur pilot s\" (9/ 11: The Big Lie, 33 - 34). In relat ion to this theory, Thompson report s that Flight s 11, 175, and 77, all of which had surprisingly few passengers for transcont inent al flight s (81, 56, and 58, respect ively), each had at least one passenger who was a senior official in Rayt heon's division of Elect ronics Warf are, which developed the Global Hawk technology (\"Timeline, \" Sept ember 25, 2001). Since such officials would presumably not have sacrif iced themselves willingly, this curious fact would seem to make sense only in conjunct ion wit h the view, held by some revisionist s mainly on the basis of video evidence, that the Twin Towers were not hit by Flight s 11 and 175 but inst ead by milit ary planes. Some who hold this theory believe that the purpose of turning off the transponders was to allow the swit ch to be made. In any case, this theory would raise the quest ion of what really happened to these two flight s and their passengers (just as the theory that the Pent agon was not really hit by Flight 77, to be discussed in Chapt er 2, raises the quest ion of what happened to this flight and its passengers). This theory would also seem to imply that the flight training undergone by the alleged hijackers, to be discussed in Chapt ers 6 and 8, was for the sake of creat ing a plausible cover story. (On the reason for ref erring to the alleged hijackers, see the sect ion on \"The Quest ion of the True Ident ity of the Hijackers\" in Ch. 6.) In any case, the fact that I have not discussed these more radical challenges to the official account in the text does not necessarily ref lect my judgment that they are not true. It simply ref lect s my judgment that , what ever their merit s, they are not necessary for the purpose of this book, which is not to explain \"what really happened\" but merely to summarize what seem to be the strongest reasons that have been given for considering the official account to be false (so as to show the need for a full invest igat ion to find out what really happened). And the evidence against the official account of the failure to prevent the attacks on the WTC is very strong independent ly of any of these more radical challenges. (In the latter part of this chapt er and in the following chapt er, by cont rast , I do deal wit h the quest ion of what really happened insof ar as it is integral to the crit ics' challenges to the official account .) 33 Throughout most of the period during which I was working on this book, I had ignored this issue, having decided on the basis of an early, cursory reading of some of the argument s that the evidence against the official view was not strong enough to include. As wit h other mat ters,"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"however, I event ually found that my init ial impression was fault y. When I finally took a serious look at the case that has been marshalled against the official account of the collapse of the WTC buildings, I found this case, especially wit h regard to WTC -7, to const itute one of the strongest argument s on behalf of the need for a new invest igat ion. 34 See FEMA's Report #403, World Trade Cent er Building Perf ormance Study (May, 2002; available at www. fema. gov/ library/ wtcst udy. sht m). 35 Bill Manning, \"Selling Out the Invest igat ion, \" Fire Engineering, January, 2002, quot ed in The New York Daily News, Jan. 4, 2002, and in Thompson, \"Timeline, \" January 4, 2002. 36 The NOVA show \"Why the Towers Fell\" appeared on PBS April 30, 2002 (www. pbs. org/ wgbh/ nova/ transcript s/2907_wt c.html).

The hist ory of the const ruct ion of the Twin Towers, however, reveals that they were unique (at the time) in this respect . For this hist ory see James Glanz and Eric Lipt on, The Rise and Fall of the World Trade Cent er (New York: Times Books/ Henry Holt & Company, 2003).

Indeed, a third phot ograph, looking direct ly into the hole creat ed by the airplane, reveals two people standing in a room, far removed from any of the flames (27). 48 Technically, as Huf schmid point s out (30), the Sout h Tower had two or even three fireballs. 49 For a pict ure of the Nort h Tower fireball, see Huf schmid, 30. 50 In Huf schmid's words, \"that jet fuel burned so rapidly that it was just a moment ary blast of hot air. The blast would have set fire to flammable object s, killed people, and broken windows, but it could not have raised the temperat ure of a massive steel struct ure by a signif icant amount . A fire will not affect steel unless the steel is exposed to it for a long. ..period of time\" (33). 51 Huf schmid, 38. 52 Wit h regard to the fire in the Sout h Tower in part icular, Huf schmid asks, rhet orically: \"How could a fire produce such incredible quant ities of heat that it could dest roy a steel building, while at the same time it is incapable of spreading beyond its init ial start ing locat ion ?

Because there were more floors above the weakened port ion of the Sout h Tower, accordingly, the addit ional weight would have led to its fast er collapse. The problem wit h this theory, Huf schmid says, is that \"the steel columns in the crash zone of the Sout h Tower were thicker in order to handle the heavier load above them\" (41). 64 Meyer, \"The World Trade Cent er Demolit ion and the So -Called War on Terrorism, \" sect ion ent ided \"Evidence for Explosives in the Twin Towers. \" 65 Ibid. , sect ion ent ided \"Did the Twin Towers Collapse on Demand ?\" 66 Huf schmid, 45. 67 Jef f King, \"The WTC Collapse: What the Videos Show, \" Indymedia Webcast News, Nov. 12, 2003 ( http://ont ario. indymedia. org/ display. php3 ?art ide_id=73428 cgroup=webcast ) . 68 Huf schmid, 50, 80.

At 9:25, which was 29 minut es after Flight 77 disappeared, air cont rollers at Dulles Airport report ed seeing a fast -moving plane, which, they warned, appeared to be heading toward the"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Whit e House. > 3 At 9:27, Vice President Cheney and Nat ional Securit y Advisor Condoleeza Rice were report edly told, while in the bunker below the Whit e House, that an airplane, being tracked by radar, was 50 miles out side Washingt on and headed toward it. > 4 Beginning at 9:33, radar dat a report edly showed the aircraf t crossing the Capit ol Belt way and heading toward the Pent agon, which it flew over at 9:35. > 5 Then, start ing from about 7,000 feet above the ground, the aircraf t made a difficult \"downward spiral, turning almost a complet e circle and dropping the last 7,000 feet in two -and -a-half minut es. \" > 6 At this time, Secret ary of Def ense Rumsf eld, according to the official account , had not been informed of the approaching aircraf t and was still wit h Represent ative Cox. While they toget her wat ched the television coverage of the WTC, Rumsf eld report edly demonst rat ed his predict ive powers again, saving: \"Believe me, this isn't over yet . There's going to be anot her attack, and it could be us. \" Moment s later, at about 9:38, the Pent agon was hit. > 7 As a result of the crash and the ensuing fire, 125 workers in the Pent agon, primarily civilians, were killed. Alt hough later that day the aircraf t that struck the Pent agon was said to be Flight 77, which was a Boeing 757, this equat ion was evident ly not immediat ely obvious. Danielle O'Brien, one of the air traf fic cont rollers at Dulles who report ed seeing the aircraf t at 9:25, said: \"The speed, the maneuverabilit y, the way that he turned, we all thought in the radar room, all of us experienced air traf fic cont rollers, that that was a milit ary plane. \" > 8 Anot her wit ness, seeing the plane from a 14t h floor apart ment in Pent agon Cit y, said that it \"seemed to be able to hold eight or twelve persons\" and \"made a shrill noise like a fight er plane. \" > 9 Lon Rains, edit or at Space News, said: \"I was convinced it was a missile. It came in so fast it sounded not hing like an airplane. \" > 10 Still anot her wit ness, who saw it from his aut omobile, was report ed as saying that it \"was like a cruise missile wit h wings. \" > 11 The official account , however, would be that it was a much bigger aircraf t, a Boeing 757—indeed, Flight 77 itself . On that day, that connect ion was, however, only gradually made. At 10: 32, ABC News report ed that Flight 77 had been hijacked, but there was no suggest ion that it had ret urned to Washingt on and hit the Pent agon. Indeed, Fox TV short ly thereaf ter said that the Pent agon had been hit by a US Air Force flight . > 12 Only somet ime in the afternoon did it become generally accept ed that the aircraf t that hit the Pent agon was Flight 77. Some crit ics of the official account reject this ident ificat ion. The chief crit ic of the official account of the strike on the Pent agon is the aforement ioned French researcher Thierry Meyssan, president of the Volt aire Net work, which the Guardian in April of 2002 described as a respect ed independent think tank whose left -leaning research project s have unt il now been considered models of reasonableness and object ivit y.\" > 13 Officials at the Pent agon have, to be sure, denounced Meyssan's theory. At a Depart ment of Def ense news brief ing on June 25, 2002, spokesperson Vict oria Clarke, when asked about Meyssan's theory, said: \"There is no quest ion, there is no doubt what happened that day. And I think it's appaling that anyone might try to put out that kind of myt h. I think it's alsoappalling for anyone to cont inue to give those sort s of people any kind of publicit y.\" > 14 It is underst andable, what ever the trut h of the mat ter is, that the Pent agon would want to discourage report ers and other people from examining Meyssans theory by calling it \"appalling. \" Meyssan himself uses the same term for the official theory, calling it \"the appalling fraud. \" > 15 But , of course, name -calling by either side of the issue should not be allowed to set tle anyt hing. The quest ion should be which of the compet ing theories is best support ed by evidence. And Meyssans argument s, combined wit h those of other crit ics, do provide many reasons for concluding that it was not Flight 77 that hit the Pent agon. I will discuss five such reasons, then point out some furt her difficult ies for the official theory about the strike on the Pent agon. Were the Sources for the Identi ficati on Credi ble? Meyssan, in addit ion to not ing that the ident ificat ion bet ween AA Flight 77 and the aircraf t that struck the Pent agon was made only gradually, argues that the original sources for this ident ificat ion are dubious. In part icular, he suggest s, all but one of the statement s on which this ident ificat ion was based came from milit ary personnel. > 16 The first move toward the ident ificat ion was made by a statement on the websit e of the Pent agon announcing that it had been hit by a \"commercial airliner, possibly hijacked. \" > 17 Then that afternoon the story that this airliner was Flight 77 spread quickly through the media. The source of this story, the Los Angeles Times report ed, was some milit ary officials speaking on condit ion of anonymit y. > 18 The media also start ed report ing that Flight 77, just bef ore it disappeared from view, had made a U-turn and headed back toward Washingt on. \" But , argues Meyssan, since the civilian air cont rollers were, according to the official account , no longer receiving informat ion from either radar or the transponder, this \"inf ormat ion must also have come from milit ary sources. > 20 The one other statement used to connect Flight 77 wit h the strike on the Pent agon was made by Theodore (\"Ted\") Olson, the US Just ice Depart ment 's Solicit or General. He said that his wif e, Barbara Olson— the well -known aut hor and television comment ator—had made two phone calls"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"to him from Flight 77 at about 9:25 and 9:30. These conversat ions, as report ed, said not hing about where the plane was or in what direct ion it was headed, but they did indicat e that Flight 77 had not already crashed or exploded but had been hijacked. Flight 77, theref ore at least might have been die aircraf t that hit the Pent agon. Skept ics about this ident ificat ion suggest that there arc at least four reasons to doubt Ted Olson's test imony. First , he is very close to the Bush administ rat ion. Besides having pleaded George W. Bush's cause bef ore the Supreme Court in the 2000 elect ion disput e, he more recent ly has def ended Vice President Cheney's attempt to prevent the release of papers from his energy task force to the commit tee invest igat ing the Enron scandal. Second, Olson has stated that there are many situat ions in which \"government officials might quit e legit imat etly have reasons to give false informat ion out .\" > 21 Third, Olsons report s about the conversat ions wit h his wif e are bot h vague and self cont radict ory. > 22 Fourt h, on the other flight s, telephone calls were report edly made by several passengers and flight attendant s, but Ted Olson is the only person who report ed receiving a call from Flight 77. This latter fact is especially strange in light of a later report that at about 9:30 the hijackers told the passengers that they were all going to die and so should call their families. Thompson asks: \"Given this announcement , why are there no phone calls from this flight except for Barbara Olson's ?\" > 23 Thompson's quest ion, in other words, is whet her there really was a call from her. This quest ion could presumably be answered by subpoenaing the telephone records of her cell phone company, American Airlines, and the Just ice Depart ment . Any of the alternat ive scenarios consist ent wit h this quest ion would need to explain, of course, what became of Barbara Olson, and also whet her it is plausible that Ted Olson would have part icipat ed in a plan wit h that out come. This issue is one of the problems ment ioned in Chapt er 9 that would face any complicit y theory about \"what really happened. \" Physi cal Evi dence That the Pentagon Was Not Hit by a Boei ng 757 In addit ion to the argument that all the informat ion originally connect ing Flight 77 wit h the aircraf t that struck the Pent agon evident ly came from dubious sources, a second argument , provided by Meyssan, consist s of physical evidence that the Pent agon was not hit by a Boeing 757, which is what AA Flight 77 was. Most import ant is the evidence provided by phot ographs that were taken immediat ely after the crash. One crucial phot o was taken by Tom Horan of the Associat ed Press just after the firet rucks had arrived but bef ore the firemen had been deployed. (This phot o is reproduced in Meyssans Pent agat e and on the cover of his 9/11: The Big Lie and is also available on the Internet . > 24) When this phot ograph was taken, the west wing's facade had not collapsed. Anot her phot o taken at this time shows that the hole in the facade was bet ween 15 and 18 feet in diamet er, cont radict ing a newspaper report that it was \"five stories high and 200 feet wide. \" > 25 This phot o also shows no damage above the hole or on either side of it. And neit her phot o shows any sign of an airplane—no fuselage, no tail, no wings, no engines > 26—or any evidence that the lawn had been scraped. > 27 What ever struck the Pent agon made a clean hit from the air and went complet ely inside. Just how far the aircraf t went into the Pent agon is shown by a phot ograph that was taken later and published by the Pent agon (and on the cover of Meyssans Pent agat e). This phot o shows that the inside wall of the third of the Pent agons five rings, known as the C-ring, was penet rat ed, result ing in a hole about seven feet in diamet er. This means that the aircraf t had the power to penet rat e six reinf orced walls. This phot ographic evidence creat es enormous problems for the official account , according to which the damage was caused by an aircraf t as large as a Boeing 757. The most obvious problem is that since the aircraf t penet rat ed only the first three rings of the Pent agon, only the nose of a Boeing 757 would have gone inside. (This can be seen in a pict ure, provided by Meyssan, in which the out line of a Boeing 757 is superimposed upon an aerial phot ograph, provided by the Depart ment of Def ense, of the Pent agons west wing. > 28) The rest of the airplane would have remained out side. As Meyssan comment s: \"We should thus be able to see the wings and the fuselage out side, and on the lawn in fact .\" In response, one might suggest that perhaps the plane burned up bef ore any phot ographs could be taken. But , Meyssan says: While the planes nose is made of carbon and the wings, cont aining the fuel, can burn, the Boeings fuselage is aluminum and the jet engines are built out of steel. At the end of the fire, it would necessarily have left a burnt -out wreck. > 29 But not the slight est sign of a burnt -out wreck is shown in the phot ograph taken by Tom Horan or any of the other phot ographs. The official story, to be sure, takes account of this problem by saying that not simply the nose but the ent ire airplane went inside the Pent agon. This is why it does not appear in the phot ographs. > 30 Other feat ures of the phot ographic evidence, however, creat e isuperable difficult ies for this theory. One of these feat ures is the fact that the orif ice creat ed by the impact , as ment ioned"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"above, was at most 18 feet in diamet er. Is it not absurd to suggest that a Boeing 757 creat ed and then disappeared into such a small hole ? As Meyssan point s out , the hole was bis enough for the passenger cabin, which is less than twelve feet in widt h. But the plane's wings give it a breadt h of 125 feet . Can anyone seriously believe that a 125 - foot -wide airplane creat ed and then went inside a hole less than 20 - feet wide ? Evident ly so. Some def enders of the official account claim that the wings, upon hitting the strongly reinf orced facade of the west wing, would have folded back, allowing the ent ire plane to disappear wit hin the building. According to one such def ense: As the front of the Boeing 757 hit the Pent agon, the out er port ions of the wings likely snapped during the init ial impact , then were pushed inward towards the fuselage and carried into the buildings interior; the inner port ions of the wings probably penet rat ed the Pent agon walls wit h the rest of the plane. Any sizable port ions of the wings were dest royed in the explosion or the subsequent fire. > 31 One problem wit h this explanat ion, of course, is that after the plane's forward morion was suddenly reduced when the nose hit the Pent agon, the wings would not have folded back Unless the laws of kinet ic energy were moment arily suspended, Meyssan point s out , \"the wings would have been propelled forwards rat her than backwards. \" > 32 On a Boeing 757, furt hermore, the jet engines, made of steel, are attached to the wings, so the wings would have hit the facade wit h great force. And yet prior to the facade's collapse, as we have seen, the phot osreveal no visible damage to the facade on either side of the orif ice, even where the engines would have hit the building. And if that problem is not considered decisive enough, the fact that the phot ographs clearly show that the facade above the opening is complet ely intact and even unmarked - creat es a still more insuperable problem, given Boeing 757's big tail. As Meyssan says, when its tail is taken into account , the Boeing is about 40 feet high. So, unless one is going to claim chat the tail obligingly ducked bef ore ent ering, the fact that the facade above the opening is complet ely intact proves that it was not a Boeing 757 that went inside the Pent agon's west wing. For support , Meyssan quot es French accident invest igat or Francois Grangier, who said: \"What is cert ain when one looks at the phot o of this facade that remains intact is that it's obvious the plane did not go through there. \" > 33 The more general problem is that what ever did hit the Pent agon simply did not cause nearly enough dest ruct ion for the official story to be true. A Boeing 757, besides being so tall and having such a wide wingspan, weighs over 100 tons. Traveling at a speed of 250 to 440 miles per hour, it would have caused tremendous devast ation. And yet , as a phot ograph supplied by the Depart ment of Def ense itself shows, \"the plane only dest royed the first ring of the building. \" > 34 The second and third rings were merely penet rat ed by an aircraf t small enough to creat e a hole only seven feet in diamet er. Furt hermore, if the aircraf t that hit the Pent agon did too little to have been a Boeing 757, this last -ment ioned fact , about the hole in the inside wall of the C-ring, shows that it also did too much. That is, Meyssan point s out , the nose of a Boeing, which cont ains the elect ronic navigat ion syst em, is made of carbon fibers rat her than met al. Being \"ext remely fragile, '' such a nose could not have gone through three rings of the Pent agon, creat ing a seven -foot exit hole in the inside wall of the third ring. The Boeing's nose would have been \"crushed rat her than piercing through. \" What could creat e such a hole is the head of a missile. Cert ain missiles are specially conceived to have a piercing effect . These missiles are weight ed wit h deplet ed uranium, an ext remely dense met al that heat s wit h slight est frict ion and renders piercing easier. These missiles are not ably used to pierce bunkers. An airplane crashes and smashes. A missile of this type pierces. > 35 And this is what the phot ographs show — that the Pent agon was pierced rat her than smashed. The not ion that the Pent agon was hit by a missile rat her than an airplane is support ed by still anot her feat ure of the phot ographic evidence — the kind of fire it document ed. Phot os of hydrocarbon fires, such as the fires produced in the Twin Towers by the burning of the jet fuel, show yellow flames mixed wit h black smoke. But phot ographs of the Pent agon fire show a red flame, indicat ing the kind of fire produced by the type of missile described above — a much hot ter and more inst ant aneous fire. > 36 Suggest ing that the Pent agon was hit by \"one of the latest generat ion of AGM -type missiles, armed wit h a hollow charge and a deplet ed uranium BLU tip,\" Meyssan says that a missile of this type can cause \"an inst ant aneous fire, giving off heat in excess of 3,600° Fahrenheit .\" And that corresponds wit h the fire start ed in the Pent agon: In traversing the Pent agon's first ring, the aircraf t start ed a fire, as gigant ic as it was sudden. Immense flames issued from the building, licking at the facades. They wit hdrew just as quickly, leaving behind them a cloud of black soot . > 37"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"The phot ographic evidence, in sum, provides several reasons to conclude that the Pent agon was not hit by a Boeing passenger plane but was inst ead hit by a milit ary missile. This conclusion from the phot ographic evidence is given addit ional support by the fact that the aircraf t that headed toward the Pent agon was not shot down by on -sit e missiles. Alt hough some news report s have said that the Pent agon, unlike the \"Whit e House, has no such missiles, the Pent agon is in fact , Meyssan point s out , prot ect ed by \"[f]ive ext remely sophist icat ed ant imissile bat teries. \" > 38 And, although Pent agon officials claim that they had no idea that an aircraf t was coming their way, an unident ified aircraf t was, as we saw earlier, report ed at 9:25 to be speeding in that direct ion. Meyssan says: Cont rary to the Pent agons claims, the milit ary thus knew perf ect ly well that an unident ified vehicle was headed straight for the capit ol. Yet the milit ary did not react and the Pent agons ant i-missile bat teries did not funct ion. Why? The close - range ant i-aircraf t def enses at the Pent agon are conceived to dest roy missiles that attempt to approach. A missile should normally be unable to pass. As for a big Boeing 757 -200, it would have strict ly no chance. Whet her an airliner or a missile, an explanat ion needs to be found. Meyssan then suggest s a hypot hesis that could account for this anomaly: Each milit ary aircraf t in fact possesses a transponder which. ..permit [s] it to declare itself in the eyes of its possessor as friendly or host ile. . An ant imissile bat tery will not ...react to the passage of a friendly missile. It is not impossible that was what happened at the Pent agon on 11 Sept ember 2001. > 39 Meyssan's hypot hesis could also answer a quest ion raised by report s that when the aircraf t was making its circular approach to the Pent agon, it came very near to the Whit e House — namely, why the Whit e House's missile syst em did not shoot it down. > 40 In light of these considerat ions, the very fact that the aircraf t that hit the Pent agon was not shot down by the Pent agons (and the Whit e House's) missiles can be considered physical evidence against the claim that it was a passenger plane. Furt her physical evidence is provided by the simple fact that there were evident ly no remains of a Boeing 757 at the crash site. As we have seen, the explanat ion why no such remains were visible in the phot ographs is that the ent ire plane went inside the Pent agon. If that is what happened (ignoring now the quest ion of whet her it is even remot ely plausible), there should have been a burnt -out wreck, or at least some ident ifiable remnant s of the plane, found inside the Pent agon after the fire was put out . But that was evident ly not the case. At a Pent agon brief ing on the day after 9/11, Ed Plaugher, the count y fire chief who was in charge of put ting out the fire in the Pent agon, was asked whet her anyt hing was left of the airplane. He said that there were \"some small pieces. ..but not large sect ions. ... [T]here's no fuselage sect ions and that sort of thing. \" > 41 According to Plaugher's eyewit ness test imony the day after the fire, theref ore, there was no fuselage or any other large pieces, such as jet engines. His test imony was, furt hermore, implicidy conf irmed by the Depart ment of Def ense insof ar as the only part s of Flight 77 that it announced finding, other than unident ifiable fragment s (which, as Meyssan point s out , \"could have been from somet hing quit e different \"), were a beacon and the two black boxes. The black boxes were said, furt hermore, to have been found at a time — 4:00 AM — that makes crit ics of the official story suspicious. > 42 Plaugher's test imony was furt her conf irmed at a Pent agon press conf erence on Sept ember 15. When Terry Mit chell was asked about evidence of the plane, he said that one could see only \"small pieces. \" Lee Evey, head of the renovat ion project , said that the evidence of the aircraf t is \"not very visible. ... None of those part s are very large. ... You don't see big pieces of the airplane sitting there ext ending up into the air. \" > 43 How is this test imony consist ent wit h the idea that the Pent agon was hit by a Boeing 757 ? That airplanes fuselage is made of aluminum, which does not melt in an ordinary hydrocarbon fire. Its engines are made of tempered steel, which also does not normally melt . And yet the more -or -less official story was that the fire was so hot that all this met al not only melt ed but was vaporized. > 44 Is this believable ? In the first place, if the fire was that hot , how did the upper floors of the Pent agon survive ? In the second place, why would the fire have been so hot if it were a hydrocarbon fire ? In the third place, even if there was somet hing about the crash that made this hydrocarbon fire ext ra hot — hot enough to produce the red flames and other effect s shown in the phot ographs — would even fire this hot vaporize aluminum and steel ? If the official story rest s on this account of the laws of physics, it is import ant enough to run an experiment to test this hypot hesis. And this could be done easily enough, using some worn -out Boeing 757. Even if one believed that there was a chance that such a test might be successf ul, however,"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"there would be one more condit ion that would have to be passed. According to at least one version of the official story, aut horit ies were able to ident ify vict ims of the crash by their fingerprint s. > 45 To provide support for the official account , theref ore, the fire would have to be hot enough to vaporize aluminum and steel and cool enough to leave human flesh intact . This would, of course, be impossible, so Meyssan is amazed that the Pent agon could evidendy make bot h of these claims wit hout fear of ridicule. > 46 In any case, such a test is no longer necessary because, as wit h other feat ures of the official account of 9/11, this one evolved into a second version. As Meyssan report s, six mont hs later, in April of 2002, the FBI claimed that enough of the Boeing 757 had been recovered to make possible its almost complet e reconst itution. An FBI spokesman, Chris Murray, was quot ed as saying: \"The pieces of the plane are stocked in a warehouse and they are marked wit h the serial numbers of flight 77\" > 47 The following mont h, furt hermore, this new version of the official account was support ed by Ed Plaugher, who now remembered that when he arrived on the scene he had seen, he said, \"pieces of the fuselage, the wings, the landing gear, pieces of the engine, seat s,\" adding: \"I can swear to you, it was a plane. \" He even — inadvert endy cont radict ing the Pent agon's statement that the black boxes were not found unt il 4:00 AM three days later-claimed to have seen one of them. > 48 It might seem that US officials could conf irm this new version of the fate of Flight 77 by simply showing the warehouse full of recovered pieces to report ers and members of the 9/11 Independent Commission. At most , however, this evidence would show only that much of the airplane had been recovered. It would not tell us that it had been recovered from the Pent agon — as opposed to Ohio, Kent ucky, or somewhere else. It is not possible, theref ore, to conf irm this theory by point ing to this physical evidence in combinat ion wit h Ed Plaugher's improved memory. Moreover, this new version, besides being in conf lict wit h Plaugher's statement s on Sept ember 12, is also in conf lict wit h the statement s of Timot hy Mit chell and Lee Evey on Sept ember 15. If big pieces of the airplane, such as the engines, the fuselage, and the tail, were in the Pent agon, why did these men not see them ? Why did Evey not see any \"big pieces of the airplane sitting there ext ending up into the air\" ? And why have our report ers not asked such obvious quest ions ? Meyssan's claim that what hit the Pent agon was somet hing other than Flight 77, we have seen, is support ed by considerable physical evidence. This claim gat hers a little addit ional support from two more fact s report ed by Paul Thompson. For one thing, when the flight cont rol transcript s for the 9/11 planes were finally released on Oct ober 16, \"Flight 77's ends at least 20 minut es bef ore it crashes. \" > 49 Alt hough there is more than one possible explanat ion for this fact , one of these explanat ions is that government officials did not want the press and the public to hear what act ually occurred during the final 20 minut es of Flight 77. The second fact is the exist ence of a news story according to which an employee at a gas station across the street from the Pent agon that services only milit ary personnel says the gas station's securit y cameras should have recorded the moment of impact . However, he says, \"I've never seen what the pict ures looked like. The FBI was here wit hin minut es and took the film. \" > 50 This report , if true — and someone could presumably interview the employee, José Velasquez — suggest s that the FBI had known that an aircraf t was going to crash into the Pent agon. How else can we explain that they got there \"wit hin minut es\" ? And, more direct ly germane to our present topic, it also suggest s that FBI officials feared that the gas station's securit y cameras might have capt ured somet hing about the crash scene that they did not want the press or the public to see, and this could have been the fact that the Pent agon was struck by a milit ary missile rat her than a commercial airliner. If, by cont rast , the camera's pict ures support ed the government s claims, we would expect the government to have made these pict ures public. So these two stories, while not const ituting physical evidence as such, do suggest that there is (or at least was ) physical evidence that would furt her undermine the official account . What about the Reported Sighti ngs of an Ameri can Airliner ? Whereas the physical evidence strongly count s against the official theory and inst ead support s the missile theory, proponent s of the official theory have relied primarily upon report s that several eyewit nesses saw an American Airliner hit the Pent agon. For example, one debunker of the view that the Pent agon was not really struck by a Boeing 757 wrot e in the Sunday Times that \"the killer blow to this conspiracy is that several wit nesses saw the plane hit the building. \" > 51 How can crit ics of the official account reconcile their revisionist view wit h the fact that these report s exist ? There seem to be four main approaches. One approach builds on the standard forensic point that when there is a conf lict bet ween physical evidence and eyewit ness test imony, the physical evidence is usually, once its aut hent icit y is conf irmed, given more weight . If the prosecut ing attorney in a criminal trial has present ed a strong case based on physical evidence, the def ense attorney can seldom hope to render a \"killer blow\" to this case simply by present ing eyewit ness test imony to the cont rary. This is because the"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"human test imony might be wrong for all sort s of reasons, such as mispercept ion, fault y memory, or out right lying (perhaps because of bribery or intimidat ion). Accordingly, any allegedly eyewit ness test imony that cont radict s the physical evidence is explained away. Meyssan employs this approach. The claims by wit nesses to have seen an American Airlines plane could be explained, he suggest s, in terms of the dynamics of the social psychology of percept ion and memory, which often leads people to \"see\" what they expect to see, or to \"remember\" having seen what they are expect ed to have seen Given the fact that these wit nesses had seen images or heard report s of airliners hitting the WTC and later heard that it was an American Airlines Boeing 757 that hit the Pent agon, it is not at all surprising that several people would report having seen such an airplane headed for the Pent agon, even if the act ual aircraf t was somet hing quit e different . > 52 Meyssan combines this approach wit h a second, which is to point out that there were also several report s of eyewit nesses who said that the aircraf t looked and/ or sounded like a missile or a milit ary plane. Recall the test imony of, for example, Dulles air traf fic cont roller Danielle O'Brien, who said that all the experienced air traf fic cont rollers in the room thought that it was a milit ary plane and the wit ness who said that it \"seemed to be able to hold eight or twelve persons\" and \"made a shrill noise like a fight er plane\" (see page 26). Meyssan, in addit ion to quot ing the statement s of these eyewit nesses and others, point s out that an AGM -type missile \"does look like a small civilian airplane\" and \"produces a whist ling noise similar to that of a fight er aircraf t.\" On this basis, he count s those who report ed seeing a milit ary plane as wit nesses on behalf of the missile theory. > 53 Finally, having shown that the eyewit nesses support ive of the official theory are at least part ly balanced by eyewit nesses support ive of the missile theory, Meyssan can assume that we should take these latter wit nesses more seriously. That is, if what hit the Pent agon was a missile, the fact that several people said that they saw a commercial airliner hit the Pent agon is not surprising, given the dynamics of the psychology of percept ion and memory. But if what hit the Pent agon had been a Boeing 757, it would be very surprising to have report s of people — especially people wit h trained eyes and ears — claiming to have seen a missile or small milit ary plane. These report s of having seen a missile or a small milit ary plane must , accordingly, be given more weight . Properly interpret ed, then, the eyewit ness test imony does not cont radict , but inst ead support s, the missile theory. There is, however, a third way to reconcile the physical evidence and the report s of eyewit ness test imony support ing the official theory. Rat her than explaining away these report s by appealing to the psychology of percept ion and memory, one could examine the report s themselves more caref ully to see if the people act ually said what they were report ed to have said. This approach is taken by Gerard Holmgren. Beginning wit h 19 account s said by the Urban Legends websit e to be eyewit ness test imony that an American airliner hit the Pent agon, > 54 Holmgren found, for start ers, that a majorit y of the people cited did not act ually claim to have seen the Pent agon hit by a commercial airplane. Inst ead, \"[w]hat they claimed was to have seen a plane flying way too low. and then immediat ely afterwards to have seen smoke or an explosion coming from the direct ion of the Pent agon which was out of sight at the time of the collision. \" (Alt hough this dist inct ion might at first glance seem too picayune, these report s would be compat ible wit h the two -aircraf t thesis, to be discussed below. ) Wit h regard to the other cases, Holmgren found one or more of the following problems: the alleged wit ness could not be ident ified; the claim that the wit ness had seen an American Airlines plane was added by the report er or the wit ness who init ially claimed to have seen the American airplane hit the Pent agon wit hdrew the claim under quest ioning — which was the case wit h Mike Walt er of USA Today when he was interviewed on CBS by Bryant Gumbel. > 55 \"What appeared at first reading to be 19 eyewit ness account s,\" Holmgren concludes, \"act ually turned out to be none. \" Then, finding ten other report s that init ially appeared to provide eyewit ness test imony, he found that they all suf fered from similar problems. Holmgren's effort s led him to the following conclusion: My conclusion is that there is no eyewit ness evidence to support the theory that F77 hit the Pent agon, unless my search has missed somet hing very signif icant . Given the strengt h of the phot ographic evidence that what ever hit the Pent agon could not possibly have been F77, I can see no reason for not stating this conclusion wit h a lot of conf idence, unless and unt il cont rary evidence emerges. > 56 There is, finally, a fourt h way to reconcile the physical evidence and the eyewit ness test imony — a way that allows an even less skept ical approach to test imony that seems to support the official theory. This approach involves the hypot hesis that there were two aircraf t heading toward the Pent agon. According to this two -aircraf t thesis, bot h set s of eyewit nesses — those who report ed seeing a missile (which they may have called a small milit ary plane) and those who report ed seeing a passenger jet (which they may have specif ically ident ified as an American airliner) —"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"were correct . Dick East man, who develops this bot h/and posit ion, says that eyewit nesses divide up into three set s: (1) those who report ed seeing \"an airliner, shiny, red and blue markings, wit h two engines, in a dive, and flying 'low' in terms of one or two hundred feet , and silent \"; (2) those who report ed seeing an aircraf t coming in \"at tree -top level, at '20 feet ' all the way, hitting lamp post s in perf ect low level flight ...engines roaring pouring on speed; smaller than a mid -sized airliner\"; and (3) those such as Kelly Knowles, in an apart ment two miles away, who \"saw two planes moving toward the Pent agon, one veering away as the other crashed. \" East man's analysis can also explain the test imony of those wit nesses who combine feat ures of the first two cat egories by supposing that they saw the American airliner while hearing the missile. East mans main point , in any case, is that at least most of the test imony of most of the wit nesses can be accept ed as accurat e, but that the only wit nesses who stated the full trut h were those in the third cat egory — those who report ed seeing two aircraf t. East mans theory, in other words, is that an American Airlines plane was put ting on an attent ion - get ting exhibit ion to draw all eyes to itself . Then it flew towards the Pent agon while the missile was heading in the same direct ion — too close to the ground for most wit nesses to see it even if they had not been dist ract ed by the airliner. Then the airliner veered off at the last second, disappearing behind the immense cloud of smoke produced by the crash. It then landed unnot iced at Reagan Nat ional Airport , which was only a mile away in the direct ion it was headed. > 57 These four approaches are not mut ually exclusive. Alt hough East man and Holmgren take different approaches, they can act ually be viewed as mut ually support ive. That is, Holmgren's main point is that most of the eyewit nesses who seemed to claim that they saw an American Airlines passenger plane hit the Pent agon act ually claimed only that they saw it come very close to the Pent agon just bef ore the explosion. East man's two -aircraf t hypot hesis explains why this dist inct ion may be import ant and also provides a reconciliat ion of all the test imony about an American airplane wit h the physical evidence that the Pent agon was not struck by any such airplane. Also, Meyssan's two approaches can be strengt hened by combining them wit h East man's approach, Holmgren's approach, or an East man -Holmgren approach. > 58 For our present purposes, it is not necessary to decide what the trut h of the mat ter is. The purpose of this discussion has been simply to show that the easy assumpt ion that Meyssan's missile theory is disproved by eyewit ness test imony is far from the trut h. Having made this point , I now ret urn to the list of reasons for believing that the aircraf t that crashed into the Pent agon was not Flight 77. The first two reasons, to recall, were that the ident ificat ion was based on dubious sources and that the physical evidence was incompat ible wit h this ident ificat ion. Why Woul d Terrori sts Have Struck the West Wi ng ? A third fact about the Pent agon crash suggest ing that it was not caused by hijackers on Flight 77 was the locat ion of the crash. Assuming that terrorist s in cont rol of a Boeing 757 would want to be cert ain of hitting their target , why would they aim at one of the facades, which are only 80 feet high, when they could have simply dived into the roof , which covers 29 acres ? More import ant , one would assume that they would have want ed to cause as much damage to the Pent agon and kill as many of its employees as possible, and these aims would also have made the roof the logical target . > 59 Furt hermore, even if there were an answer to that quest ion, why would they hit the west wing, which was the one part of the Pent agon that was being renovat ed ? As the Los Angeles Times report ed: It was the only area of the Pent agon wit h a sprinkler syst em, and it had been reconst ruct ed wit h a web of steel columns and bars [and blast -resist ant windows] to wit hst and bomb blast s.... While perhaps 4,500 people normally would have been working in the hardest -hit areas because of the renovat ion work only about 800 were there. > 60 One would also assume that terrorist s would be especially interest ed in killing the Pent agons top civilian and milit ary leaders, but the attack on the west wing killed none of them. > 61 Most of the casualt ies were civilians, many of whom were working on the renovat ion, \"and only one general was to be found among the milit ary vict ims. \" > 152 If the Pent agon was struck by terrorist s flying a Boeing 757, why would they target the west wing, where the crash would have the least rat her than the great est impact ? The force of this quest ion is increased by the fact that according to the report ed radar dat a, the aircraf t, given its traject ory, was able to hit the west wing only by execut ing a very difficult downward spiral. > 63 In other words, it was act ually technically difficult to do as little damage to the Pent agon as was done. Coul d an Inexperi enced Pilot Have Flown the Aircraft ? This downward spiral was so difficult and so perf ect ly execut ed, in fact that it raises a fourt h argument against the official account . This argument is that no pilot wit h the minimal training the hijackers evident ly had could have execut ed this maneuver. > 64 On this issue, Ahmed quot es the milit ary expert Stan Gof f's descript ion of what he considers \"the real kicker\" in the official account :"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"A pilot they want us to believe was trained at a Florida puddle -jumper school for Piper Cubs and Cessnas, conduct s a well -cont rolled downward spiral, descending the last 7,000 feet in two -and -a-half minut es, brings the plane in so low and flat that it clips the elect rical wires across the street from the Pent agon, and flies it wit h pinpoint accuracy into the side of this building at 460 naut s.... When the theory about learning to fly this well at the puddle -jumper school began to lose ground, it was added that they received furt her training on a flight simulat or. This is like saying you prepared your teenager for her first drive on I-40 at rush hour by buying her a video driving game. > 65 This argument is made even stronger by the fact that the man who was supposed to be the pilot , Hani Hanjour, was report edly not just an amat eur but also an especially incompet ent one. According to a story in the New York Times: Staff members charact erized Mr. Hanjour as polit e, meek and very quiet . But most of all, [a] former employee said, they considered him a very bad pilot . \"I'm still to this day amazed that he could have flown into the Pent agon, \" the former employee said. \"He could not fly at all. \" And according to a report on CBS News: Mont hs bef ore Hani Hanjour is believed to have flown an American Airlines jet into the Pent agon, managers at an Arizona flight school report ed him at least five times to the FAA. They report ed him not because they feared he was a terrorist , but because his English and flying skills were so bad. ... [T]hey didn't think he should keep his pilot s license. \"I couldn't believe he had a commercial license of any kind wit h the skills that he had, \" said Peggy Chevret te, Arizona flight school manager. > 66 How could anyone believe that this pilot could have handled the perf ect maneuver execut ed by the aircraf t that hit the Pent agon ? Coul d Flight 77 Real ly Have Been Lost for Hal f an Hour? A fifth problem that has been raised for the official account is that it ent ails Flight 77 having flown toward Washingt on for 29 minut es wit hout being det ect ed by any radar syst em. A Pent agon spokesman report edly said: \"The Pent agon was simply not aware that this aircraf t was coming our way. \" > 67 Thompson asks, rhet orically: \"Is it conceivable that an airplane could be lost inside US air space for [that long] ?\" > 68 Even if the local air cont rollers did not have the kind of radar syst em that can track a plane wit h its transponder off, as claimed. > 69 the FAA syst em cert ainly would have been able to track the flight pat h back to Washingt on. > 70 Even more, Meyssan argues, the Pent agon possesses \"several very sophist icat ed radar monit oring syst ems, incomparable wit h the civilian syst ems. \" The PAVE PAWS syst em, for example, \"does not miss anyt hing occurring in Nort h American airspace. \" According to its websit e, it is \"capable of det ect ing and monit oring a great number of target s that would be consist ent wit h a massive SLBM [Submarine Launched Ballist ic Missile] attack\" Are we to believe that it can do all this, Meyssan wonders, while not being able to det ect a single giant airliner headed toward the Pent agon itself ? > 71 Why Was the Stri ke Not Prevented by Standard Operati ng Procedures ? Besides all these quest ions, which are specif ic to the strike on the Pent agon, the official account of the Pent agon strike is faced by the generic quest ion: Assuming that the strike was made by Flight 77 under the cont rol of hijackers, why was it not prevent ed by standard operat ing procedures ? To crit ics, this quest ion seems even more powerf ul in relat ion to this strike because it occurred over a half hour after the second WTC tower was hit, so that the Nat ional Milit ary Command Cent er at the Pent agon should have been in the highest possible state of alert , and also because the Pent agon is probably the most well -def ended building on the face of the planet . > 72 How does the official account explain the fact that in this case it was not def ended at all? According to the first version, as we have seen, fight er jets were not even ordered unt il after the Pent agon had been struck. However, since US officials quickly gave up this story, we will move direct ly to crit icisms of the second version. According to this account , given by NORAD, the FAA did not not ify it that Flight 77 had been hijacked and was heading toward Washingt on unt il 9:24 > 73 — which would be 34 minut es after the FAA had, according to the official account , lost radio cont act wit h the plane and 28 minut es after the plane disappeared from its radar. Then at 9:27, NORAD ordered planes scrambled from Langley Air Force Base. These planes are said not to have arrived unt il about 15 minut es after the Pent agon was struck at 9:38. > 74 Crit ics ask several quest ions about this account . Why was not the NMCC and hence NORAD, wit h"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"its superior radar syst em, independent ly monit oring the flight pat h? Even if we ignore this quest ion, how could the FAA have been so leisurely, especially given the fact that short ly after 9:03 everyone in the syst em would have known that two hijacked airplanes had been flown into the WTC ? \"Is such a long delay believable, \" Thompson asks, \"or has that informat ion been doct ored to cover the lack of any scrambling of fight ers ?\" > 75 Also, why would it take NORAD, after finally hearing from the FAA, anot her three minut es to order planes scrambled ? And why would it order those planes from Langley, which is 130 miles from Washingt on, rat her than from Andrews Air Force Base, which is only 10 miles away and has the assignment to prot ect Washingt on ? In relat ion to this last quest ion, USA Today report ed that it was told by Pent agon sources that Andrews \"had no fight ers assigned to it.\" Anot her story in that newspaper the same day report ed that Andrews did have fight ers present \"but those planes were not on alert .\" > 76 Bykov and Israel argue that bot h stories, besides being inherent ly implausible, are cont radict ed by the US milit ary informat ion websit e. According to it, Andrews houses the 121 st Fight er Squadron of the 113 th Fight er Wing, which is equipped wit h F-16 fight ers and \"provides capable and ready response forces for the Dist rict of Columbia in the event of nat ural disast er or civil emergency. \" Andrews also has the Marine Fight er Attack Squadron 321, which \"flies the sophist icat ed F/A-18 Hornet \" and is support ed by a reserve squadron that \"provides maint enance and supply funct ions necessary to maint ain a force in readiness. \" > 77 Andrews also has the Dist rict of Columbia Air Nat ional Guard (DCANG), which said on its websit e that its \"mission\" was \"to provide combat unit s in the highest possible state of readiness. \" > 78 In addit ion to this evidence, the falsit y of the claim that Andrews had no fight ers on alert , say crit ics, is shown by the fact that , as widely report ed, immediat ely after the attack on the Pent agon, F-l6s from Andrews were flying over Washingt on. > 79 One of the dist urbing quest ions, theref ore, is why the Pent agon would have put out disinf ormat ion. Anot her quest ion is why some of the websit es were changed after 9/11. Thompson report s, for example, that the DCANG websit e was changed to say merely that it had a \"vision\" to \"provide peacet ime command and cont rol and administ rat ive mission oversight to support cust omers, DCANG unit s, and NGB in achieving the highest state of readiness. \" > 80 In any case, it remains a puzzle, these crit ics say, why officials NORAD — or NMCC — would have ordered planes to come from Langley, unless they were simply invent ing a story to explain why no planes appeared in time to stop the attack If so, the crit ics add, even this story is inadequat e. Thompson writ es (from wit hin the framework of the official account ) that if F-l6s from Langley were airborne by 9:30, as alleged, they would have to travel slight ly over 700 mph to reach Washingt on bef ore Flight 77 does. The maximum speed of an F-16 is 1,500 mph. Even at traveling 1,300 mph, these planes could have reached Washingt on in six minut es — well bef ore any claim of when Flight 77 crashed. > 81 Given the fact that the planes were said to arrive 15 minut es too late, crit ics find this story absurd. As George Szamuely put s it: \"If it took the F-l6s half an hour to cover 150 miles, they could not have been traveling at more than 300 mph — at 20 percent capabilit y.\" > 82 In any case, had the jet fight ers been ordered from Andrews, as they should have been, they would have had even more time. A still deeper problem is why the fight ers were not flying over Washingt on long bef ore that . Capt ain Michael Jellinek, the command direct or of NORAD, report edly said that at some point not long after the first attack on the WTC, telephone links were est ablished wit h the NMCC, Strat egic Command, theat er commanders, and federal emergency -response agencies in order to have an Air Threat Conf erence Call. At one time or anot her, it was report ed, the voices of President Bush, Vice President Cheney, key milit ary officers, FAA and NORAD leaders, the Whit e House, and Air Force One were heard on the open line. Brigadier General Mont ague Winf ield, head of the NMCC, report edly said: \"All of the government al agencies there that , that were involved in any act ivit y that was going on in the Unit ed States at that point , were in that conf erence. \" The call report edly cont inued right through the Pent agon explosion. > 83 One implicat ion of this admit ted fact is that all of these individuals and agencies would have known since 8:56 that Flight 77 was presumed to be hijacked and also that all airplane takeof fs from Washingt on were stopped short ly after the crash of Flight 175 at 9:03. Thompson asks: \"Why is the emergency considered import ant enough to stop all takeof fs from Washingt on at this time, but not import ant enough to scramble even a single plane to def end Washingt on ?\" > 84 Why Was the Pentagon Not Evacuated ? One of the dist urbing quest ions raised by the crash of Flight 175 into the second tower of the WTC, as we saw, was why there was a public announcement telling people that the building was secure so they should ret urn to their offices. A similar quest ion is raised by the attack on the Pent agon, even if the official account is accept ed. According to this account , Flight 77 was lost at"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"8:56, just after the radar allegedly showed it making a U-turn back towards Washingt on. Given the fact that the Pent agon was called by its staff \"Ground Zero, \" even having a snack bar of that name, > 85 why would its officials, knowing of the attacks on the WTC, not have ordered its immediat e evacuat ion ? Furt hermore, even if they did not do so short ly after 8:56, why did they not do so immediat ely upon learning that the air traf fic cont rollers had spot ted an unident ified fast -flying aircraf t heading in the direct ion of the Pent agon and the Whit e House at 9:25 ? In the 13 minut es remaining bef ore the Pent agon was hit, virt ually everyone, presumably, could have been evacuat ed. In explaining why this was not done, a Pent agon spokesman said: \"The Pent agon was simply not aware that this aircraf t was coming our way. \" Def ense Secret ary Rumsf eld and his top aides, in part icular, were said to be unaware of any danger up to the moment of impact . > 86 However, since the crash of the first plane into the WTC at 8:46, according to the New York Times, \"milit ary officials in [the Nat ional Milit ary Command Cent er] on the east side of the [Pent agon] were urgendy talking to law enf orcement and air traf fic cont rol officials about what to do. \" And, according to the official story, the FAA had not ified NORAD at 9:24 that Flight 77 appeared to be headed back towards Washingt on. > 87 Having cited these report s, Thompson asks: \"Is it believable that everyone in the Pent agon out side of that command cent er, even the Secret ary of Def ense, would remain uninf ormed ?\" > 88 And if it is not believable, then why were those people in the west wing allowed to be killed ? Offi cial Reacti on to Meyssan's Theory When Meyssan's theory was published, it was immediat ely denounced by U.S. officials. On April 2, 2002, the FBI issued a statement saying: To even suggest that AA77 did not crash into the Pent agon on Sept ember 11 is the ultimat e insult to the memory of the 59 men, women and children on AA77 and the 125 dedicat ed milit ary and civilian workers in the Pent agon who were rut hlessly murdered by terrorist s on Sept ember 11. A similar statement was made later that mont h on behalf of the Depart ment of Def ense by Vict oria Clarice, who said: I think even the suggest ion of it is ludicrous. And finally, it is just an incredible, incredible insult to the friends and the relat ives and the family members of the almost 200 people that got killed here on Sept ember 11 th and the thousands who were killed in New York. > 89 Meyssan agrees, of course, that the 125 Pent agon workers were rut hlessly murdered by terrorist s. He simply disagrees wit h the official theory as to the ident ity of these rut hless terrorist s. He also agrees that it would be an insult to the vict ims and their families and friends for anyone knowingly to perpet rat e a false account of who was responsible. He simply disagrees on the quest ion of who is guilt y of this insult . These mut ual recriminat ions, of course, set tle not hing. What we need is a full invest igat ion into the strike on the Pent agon, in conjunct ion wit h such an invest igat ion into the attacks on the World Trade Cent er, in which all the dist urbing quest ions raised by Meyssan and other crit ics of the official account s can be thoroughly examined. If the evidence relat ed to the strike on the Pent agon is added, the third of the possible views discussed in the Introduct ion would seem to be ruled out . According to that view, no US officials part icipat ed in the planning for the attacks. But the evidence about the Pent agon strike present ed by the crit ics of the official account , especially Meyssan, seems to require act ive planning by members of the US milit ary, at least in this incident (because only an aircraf t belonging to the US milit ary would have had a transponder that signaled friendly to the Pent agons ant imissile bat teries and thereby avoided being shot down). Alt hough the evidence from this flight itself might allow these members to belong to some rogue out fit wit hin the milit ary, the evidence from the previous flight s has already shown that the conspirat ors must have included NMCC officials in the Pent agon itself Also, if the stories about Rumsf eld's predict ion of the strike on the Pent agon as well as the strike on one of the WTC towers is true, the civilian head of the Pent agon would seem to have known when the attacks were to occur. ================= To summarize where we are wit h regard to the first three flight s: From the point of view of the crit ics, a scrut iny of the official account of 9/11 in light of the act ual fact s leaves us only two possible conclusions: our government and milit ary leaders were either incredibly incompet ent or criminally complicit . And the problem wit h the incompet ence theory, says Canada's award -winning journalist Barrie Zwicker, is that \"[i]ncompet ence usually earns reprimands\" and yet \"there have been no report s, to my knowledge, of reprimands. \" He then adds: \"This causes me to ask—and other media need to ask—if there were 'stand down' orders. \" > 90 Answering his own quest ion, he says:"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"In the almost two hours of the total drama not a single US Air Force intercept or turns a wheel unt il it's too late. Why? Was it total incompet ence on the part of aircrews trained and equipped to scramble in minut es?... Simply to ask these few quest ions is to find the official narrat ive frankly implausible. The more quest ions you pursue, it becomes more plausible that there's a different explanat ion: Namely, that element s wit hin the top US milit ary, intelligence and polit ical leadership. ..are complicit in what happened on Sept ember the 11 th. > 91 Gore Vidal reaches the same conclusion. Ref lect ing on the official reject ion of any inquiry \"not limit ed to the assumpt ion that the administ rat ions inact ion was solely a consequence of 'breakdowns among federal agencies, '\" he concludes: So for reasons that we must never know, those \"breakdowns\" are to be the goat . That they were more likely to be not break but \"st and -downs\" is not for us to pry. Cert ainly the hour -twent y-minut e failure to put fight er planes in the air could not have been due to a breakdown throughout the ent ire Air Force along the East Coast . Mandat ory standard operat ing procedure had been told to cease and desist , > 92 Bot h Zwicker and Vidal conclude that complicit y rat her than incompet ence—\"st and down\" rat her than \"break down\"—is the more plausible explanat ion of how the attacks on the WTC could have succeeded. Relevant to this discussion is Michael Parent is observat ion that polit ical leaders somet imes \"seize upon incompet ence as a cover\"—t hat is, as a way to deny their act ive involvement in some illegal operat ion. This admission of incompet ence is then \"eagerly embraced by various comment ators, \" because they pref er to see their leaders as suf fering from incompet ence \"rat her than to sec deliberat e decept ion. \" Is that what is going on here ? Ahmed, ref lect ing on Jared Israel's discussion, says that if there was as much incompet ence on 9/11 as the official account irnplies \"then evidence of inst itutional incompet ence wit hin these emergency response services should have frequent ly surf aced during previous responses to rout ine emergencies, possible hijackings, and so on. There is no such evidence\" xx93 Must not this quest ion be pressed ? How could a syst em that normally works flawlessly, according to all available evidence, suddenly, on the day that these attacks were scheduled to occur, suf fer so many inexplicable breakdowns ? This quest ion has not gone unasked by family members of the vict ims of 9/11. For example, Krist en Breit weiser, whose husband died in the WTC, said on Phil Donahue's television show: I don't underst and how a plane could hit our Def ense Depart ment ... an hour after the first plane hit the first tower. I don't underst and how that is possible. I'm a reasonable person. But when you look at the fact that we spend a half trillion dollars on nat ional def ense and you're telling me that a plane is able to hit our Pent agon. ..an hour after the first tower is hit ? There are procedures and prot ocols in place in this nat ion that are to be followed when transponders are disconnect ed, and they were not followed on Sept ember 11 th.xx94 Do we not owe her an answer ? ======= An interest ing foot not e to this chapt er: While correct ing page proof s, I learned of an interview wit h Secret ary of Def ense Rumsf eld in the Pent agon on Oct ober 12, 2001, in which he, in speaking of the various kinds of weapons used by the terrorist s, ref erred to \"the missile [used] to damage this building. \"xx95 Was this a revealing slip ?

The fate of UA Flight 93, say crit ics, present s us wit h the opposit e problem: A plane that should not have been shot down was. Paul Thompson's timeline provides evidence from which he draws this conclusion. The crucial items in the first part of this timeline are the following: Flight 93 depart ed from Newark 41 minut es late, at 8:42 AM. At 9:27, one passenger, Tom Burnet t, called his wif e, telling her that the plane had been hijacked and that she should call the FBI , which she did. At 9:28, ground flight cont rollers heard sounds of screaming and scuf fling. At 9:34, Tom Burnet t again called his wif e, who told him about the attacks on the WTC, leading him to realize that his own plane was on \"a suicide mission. \" At 9:36, the plane turned toward Washingt on. At 9:37, Jeremy Glick and two other passengers learned about the WTC attacks. > 1 At 9:45, Tom Burnet t told his wif e that he did not think, cont rary to the hijackers' claim, that they had a bomb, and that he and others were making a plan. By this time, which was 19 minut es bef ore the plane went down, the FBI was monit oring these calls. At 9:45, wit h the FBI list ening in, passenger Todd Beamer began a long phone conversat ion wit h a Verizon represent ative, describing the situat ion on board. > 2 Short ly after 9:47, Jeremy Click told his wif e that all the men had vot ed to attack the hijackers, adding that the latter had only knives, no guns (which would, in combinat ion wit h the convict ion that the hijackers did not really have a bomb, have increased the passengers' belief that they could be successf ul). > 3 At 9:54, Tom Burnet t called his wif e again. According to early report s, he said: \"I know we're all going to die. There's three of uswho are going to do somet hing about it.\" > 4 However, according to a later more complet e account , he sounded more opt imist ic, saying: \"It's up to us. I think we can do it,\" adding that they were planning to gain cont rol of the plane over a rural area. > 5 The following incident s in Thompson's timeline suggest to him that the plane was shot down after it became evident that the passengers — among whom were a prof essional pilot and a flight cont roller > 6 — might gain cont rol of the plane. At 9:57, one of the hijackers was heard saying that there was fight ing out side the cockpit . A voice from out side said: \"Let 's get them. \" At 9:58, Todd Beamer ended his phone call by saying that the passengers planned \"to jump\" the hijacker in the back of the plane, then uttered his famous words: \"Are you ready guys ? Let 's roll. \" > 7 At 9:58, a passenger talking on the phone to her husband said: \"I think they're going to do it. They're forcing their way into the cockpit .\" A little later, she exclaimed: \"They're doing it! They're doing it! They're doing it!\" But her husband then heard screaming in the background followed by a \"whooshing sound, a sound like wind, \" then more screaming, after which he lost cont act . > 8 Anot her passenger, calling from a rest room, report edly said just bef ore cont act was lost that he heard \"some sort of explosion\" and saw \"whit e smoke coming from the plane. \" > 9 (Mont hs later, the FBI denied that the recording of this call cont ained any ment ion of smoke or an explosion, but the person who took this call was not allowed to speak to the media. > 10) The person list ening to Jeremy Click's open phone line report edly said: \"The silence last ed two minut es and then there was a mechanical sound, followed by more screams. Finally, there was a mechanical sound, followed by not hing. \" > 11 According to one newspaper report , moreover: \"Sources claim the last thing heard on the cockpit voice recorder is the sound of wind — suggest ing the plane had been holed. \" > 12 Thompson believes that this record shows that the plane was indeed \"holed\" — shot down by a missile or two — after it seemed that the passengers were gaining cont rol of it. Thompson is also suspicious about the tape of the cockpit recording and the official crash time."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Relat ives of vict ims have been allowed to list en to this tape. It begins at 9:31 and runs for 31 minut es, so that it ends at 10: 02. This would be close to the time of the crash — if the crash occurred at 10: 03, as the US government claims. However, a seismic study concluded that the crash occurred slight ly after 10: 06, leading the Philadelphia Daily News to print an art icle ent itled \"Three -Minut e Discrepancy in Tape. \" Thompson asks: \"What happened to the last three or four minut es of this tape ?\" > 13 And this was not , Thompson report s, the only record of this flight that was missing. On Oct ober 16, the government released flight cont rol transcript s of the airplanes — except for Flight 93. > 14 Wit h regard to the suspicion that the plane was shot down, it is signif icant that according to news report s, it was short ly after 9:56 that fight er jets were finally given orders to intercept and shoot down any airplanes under the cont rol of hijackers. > 15 Short ly thereaf ter, a milit ary aide report edly said to Vice President Cheney: \"There is a plane 80 miles out . There is a fight er in the area. Should we engage ?\", to which Cheney responded \"Yes, \" after which an F-16 went in pursuit of Flight 93. > 16 It was also report ed that as the fight er got nearer to Flight 93, Cheney was asked two more times to conf irm that the fight er should engage, which Cheney did. > 17 Also, Brigadier General Winf ield of the NMCC later said: \"At some point , the closure time came and went , and not hing happened, so you can imagine everyt hing was very tense at the NMCC. \" > 18 Furt hermore, when President Bush was told of the crash of Flyght 93 at 10: 08, he report edly asked: \"Did we shoot it town or did it crash ?\" > 19 These report s, which are cont ained in Thompsons timeline, suggest to him that the intent ion to shoot down Flight 93 was in several minds. Report s of fight er jets in the area add to his suspicion that Flight 93 was indeed shot down. Short ly bef ore the crash, CBS television report ed that two F-16 fight ers were tailing the flight . And a flight cont roller, ignoring an order to cont rollers not to talk to the media, report edly said that \"an F-16 fight er closely pursued Flight 93. ... [T]he F-16 made 360 - degree turns to remain close to the commercial jet.\" > 20 The exist ence of a fight er plane in the area is support ed, furt hermore, by many wit nesses on the ground. Accort ing to a story in the Independent , \"At least half a dozen named individuals. ..have report ed seeing a second plane flying low. ..over the crash site wit hin minut es of the Unit ed flight crashing. They describe the plane as a small, whit e jet wit h rear engines and no discernible markings. \" > 21 The FBI claimed that the plane was a Fairchild Falcon 20 business jet. > 22 But , said one woman: It was whit e wit h no markings but it was def init ely milit ary. .. It had two rear engines, a big fin on the back like a spoiler. ... It def init ely wasn't one of those execut ive jets. The FBI came and talked to me andsaid there was no plane around. ... But I saw it and it was there bef ore the crash and it was 40 feet above my head. They did not want story. > 23 Her assert ion, which is support ed by the consensus report ed by the Independent , is furt her support ed by statement s quot ed by Thompson in which several other people say that they had seen a whit e plane, wit h some of them adding the det ails about rear engines and the lack of discernible markings. Even stronger evidence that the plane was shot down is provided by wit nesses who heard sounds. One wit ness said that after she heard the planes engine, she heard \"a loud thump\" and then \"two more loud thumps and didn't hear the plane's engine anymore. \" Anot her wit ness heard \"a loud bang. \" Anot her heard \"two loud bangs\" bef ore wat ching the plane take a downward turn. Anot her heard a sound that \"wasn't quit e right ,\" after which the plane \"dropped all of a sudden, like a stone. \" Anot her heard a \"loud bang\" and then saw the plane's right wing dip, after which the plane plunged into the eart h. And the mayor of Shanksville (Ernie Stull, see the german Wisnewski video Akt enzeichen 911) report edly said that he knew of two people who \"heard a missile, \" adding that one of them \"served in Viet nam and he says he's heard them. \" Thompson concludes that while some of the account s have conf lict ing element s, they \"virt ually all support a missile strike. \" > 24 This conclusion is undergirded still furt her by report s about the locat ion of remnant s from the plane. For one thing, a half -ton piece or one of the engines was report edly found over a mile away. One newspaper story called this fact \"int riguing\" because \"the heat -seeking, air -to-air Sidewinder missiles aboard an F-16 would likely target one of the Boeing 757's two large engines. \" > 25 Also consist ent wit h one or more missile strikes, Thompson point s out , is the fact that wit nesses report ed seeing burning debris fall from the plane as far as eight miles away, wit h workers at Indian Lake Marina saying that they saw \"a cloud of conf etti-like debris descend on the lake and nearby farms minut es after hearing the explosion. \" > 26 And debris, including what appeared to be human remains, was indeed report edly found as far as eight miles from the crash site. > 27 The inference that Flight 93 was shot down is addit ionally support ed by subsequent statement s made by milit ary and government officials. One F-15 pilot report edly said that after ret urning from his assignment to pat rol the skies over NYC in the early afternoon, he was told that a milit ary F-"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"16 had shot down a fourt h airliner in Pennsylvania. > 28 This rumor was suf ficient ly widespread that when General Myers was being interviewed by the Armed Services Commit tee on Sept ember 13, Senat or Carl Levin, asking Myers whet her the Def ense Depart ment took act ion against any aircraf t, ment ioned that \"there have been statement s that the aircraf t that crashed in Pennsylvania was shot down, \" adding: \"Those stories cont inue to exist .\" Alt hough Myers declared that \"the armed forces did not shoot down any aircraf t,\" > 29 Paul Wolf owit z, Deput y Secret ary of Def ense, report edly said that \"the Air Force was tracking the hijacked plane that crashed in Pennsylvania. ..and had been in a posit ion to bring it down if necessary. \" > 30 Thompson believes that the government decided that it was necessary — but not because the hijackers' mission was going to succeed. Thompson asks why fight er pilot s were given aut horizat ion to shoot down hijacked airplanes only after Flight 93 was the only one left in the sky. > 31 This is, of course, the dist urbing quest ion raised by the evidence Thompson present s about this flight . His implicit answer, given the evidence that the passengers were successf ully wrest ing cont rol of the plane away from the hijackers, is that this was the one plane that was likely to be landed saf ely — which would, among other things, mean that there might be live hijackers to be interrogat ed. Thus interpret ed, the evidence about Flight 93 provides furt her reason to conclude that the failure to shoot down the previous three flight s was not due to incompet ence. This evidence suggest s that when the aut horit ies want ed a flight shot down, they were not hindered by lack of either compet ence or coordinat ion. The evidence from this flight suggest s, like the previous ones, act ive involvement of US milit ary leaders in planning the attacks. In this case, they apparendy also had to take remedial act ion because of an unexpect ed development . Wit h regard to the possible levels of official complicit y list ed in the Introduct ion: Insof ar as the revisionary account of Flight 93 (and/ or Flight 77) is accept ed, all the possible views lower than the fifth one are ruled out . An intriguing dimension of this story is that Flight 93's fate was evident ly due to the fact that it was 41 minut es late depart ing from the airport . All four flight s were scheduled to leave at about the same time and were hence probably intended to hit their respect ive target s at about the same time. The other three planes were fairly well synchronized depart ing only bet ween 10 and 16 minut es late. But because Flight 93's depart ure was 41 minut es late, by the time the hijackers took cont rol of it the two planes headed toward the WTC had already hit their target s Passengers making phone calls from Flight 93 learned, theref ore, that their flight was on a suicide mission. Unlike the passengers on the two flight s headed for the WTC, accordingly, the passengers on Flight 93, knowing that they were headed for cert ain deat h if they remained passive, decided to try to gain cont rol of the plane. > 32 Had the plane not been so late leaving, the passengers may not have tried this, so this plane might also have hit its target . Had it hit its target , furt hermore, we might well look back upon Flight 93 s mission as in some respect s the most devast ating one. Evacuat ion of the US Capit ol building did not begin unt il 9:48, which was 23 minut es after an unident ified aircraf t had been spot ted flying across Washingt on and 10 minut es after it had hit the Pent agon. What if Flight 93 had been more nearly on time ? Thompson says: \"It is later report ed that the target for Flight 93 was the Capit ol building, so had that flight not been delayed 40 minut es bef ore takeof f, it is possible most senat ors and congresspeople would have been killed. \" > 33 Thompson is perhaps trying to mot ivat e them to undert ake a more far-reaching invest igat ion into the event s of 9/11. Also, given the fact that the other main hypot hesis about Flight 93'sint ended target is that it was the Whit e House, crit ics also wonder why it was not evacuat ed sooner. According to many news report s, bot h Vice President Cheney and Nat ional Securit y Advisor Rice were taken to the Whit e House's underground bunker by the Secret Service at about 9:03. > 34 However, it was over 40 minut es later, at 9:45, when a general evacuat ion of the Whit e House was begun. > 35 If it was thought at 9:03 that Cheney and Rice were in danger, why were not the other people told to leave at that time ? At the very least , why was the Whit e House not evacuat ed short ly after 9:25, when the air traf fic cont rollers at Dulles report ed a fast -flying plane headed toward the Whit e House ? This quest ion is even more pressing insof ar as the official account of Flight 77 is accept ed, according to which the passengers were told that they were all going to the because the plane was going to crash into the Whit e House. > 36 Had that been true, people working in the Whit e House, inst ead of people working in the Pent agon, would have been killed, since the evacuat ion of the Whit e House did not begin unt il seven minut es after the Pent agon was struck. We have, accordingly, still anot her dist urbing quest ion: Was there a plan to have deat hs in the Whit e House or the US Capit ol Building as well as the Pent agon and the World Trade Cent er?

CHAPTER FOUR THE PRESI DENT'S BEHAVI OR: WHY DID HE ACT AS HE DID? Dist urbing quest ions about the official account have been raised not only by the four aircraf t"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"crashes of 9/11 but also by President Bush's behavior on that day. Alt hough the quest ions that crit ics have raised about that behavior are legion, I will focus on those that seem most dist urbing. The president 's schedule that day called for him to visit an element ary school in Sarasot a, Florida, where he was to list en to student s read as a \"phot o opport unit y.\" He arrived at the school short ly bef ore 9:00 AM, at which time, according to at least one version of the official account , he was told that a plane had flown into the WTC. Since it was by then known that this plane as well as two others had been hijacked, one would assume, crit ics point out , that the president would also know this. Allan Wood and Paul Thompson state the problem thus: The first media report s of Flight 11's crash into the World Trade Cent er began around 8:48, two minut es after the crash happened. CNN broke into its regular programming at that time. ... So wit hin minut es, millions were aware of the story, yet Bush supposedly remained unaware for about anot her ten minut es. > 1 Crit ics find this difficult to believe. The members of the president s traveling staff, including the Secret Service, argues Barrie Zwicker, \"have the best communicat ions equipment in the world. \" Accordingly, says Zwicker, wit hin a minut e after the first airliner hit the World Trade Cent er, the Secret Service and the president would have known about it. > 2 In fact , Thompson point s out , Vice President Cheney evidendy let the cat out of the bag. During his interview on \"Meet the Press\" on Sept ember 16, Cheney said: \"The Secret Service has an arrangement wit h the FAA. They had open lines after the World Trade Cent er was. ..\"—st opping himself , Thompson adds, bef ore finishing the sent ence. > 3 So, the Secret Service personnel in the president s mot orcade, including the ones in his own car, would have known about the first attack on the WTC bef ore the mot orcade arrived at the school at 9:00. Indeed, it is even part of the official account that Ari Fleischer, the Whit e House press secret ary, learned about the first attack on the way. Having cited that story, Thompson adds: \"It would make sense that Bush is told about the crash immediat ely and at the same time that others hear about it. Yet Bush and others claim he isn't told unt il he arrives at the school. \" Thompsons implied quest ion, of course, is that if President Bush knew about the crash bef ore arriving at the school, why did he and others pret end otherwise ? The vice president s inadvert ent revelat ion about the open lines bet ween the Secret Service and the FAA creat es an even great er difficult y, crit ics point out , for anot her part of the official account . Upon learning that a plane had hit the WTC, President Bush report edly ref erred to the crash as a \"horrible accident .\" > 4 However, Zwicker's complet e statement , only part ially summarized above, includes the point that by that time, the Secret Service and the president would have known that several airliners had been hijacked. So how could President Bush have assumed that the first crash into the WTC was an accident ? Giving voice to the dist urbing quest ion raised by this story, Thompson asks: \"[Are] Bush and his aides put ting on a charade to pret end he doesn't know there is a nat ional emergency ? If so, why ?\" > 5 In any case, the president was then report edly updat ed on the situat ion via telephone by his Nat ional Securit y Advisor, Condoleezza Rice, who would presumably have made sure that he knew not only about all the hijackings but also that the Direct or of the CIA, George Tenet , had already concluded that the hijackings were orchest rat ed by Osama bin Laden to carry out terrorist attacks. > 6 But the president report edly told the school's principal that \"a commercial plane has hit the World Trade Cent er and we're going to go ahead and. ..do the reading thing anyway. \" > 7 Crit ics find this incredible. If the hijackings were unant icipat ed occurrences, as claimed, wit h one of the hijacked airplanes having already complet ed its terrorist mission, the count ry was suf fering the worst terrorist attack of its hist ory. And yet the Commander in Chief , rat her than making sure that his milit ary was prepared to shoot down all hijacked planes, sticks to his planned schedule. The strangeness of this behavior is brought out well in a summary of the situat ion by Wood and Thompson: At approximat ely 8:48 AM. ..,the first pict ures of the burning World Trade Cent er were broadcast on live television. ... By that time, the Federal Aviat ion Administ rat ion (FAA), the Nort h American Aerospace Def ense Command (NORAD), the Nat ional Milit ary Command Cent er, the Pent agon, the Whit e House, the Secret Service, and Canada's Strat egic Command all knew that three commercial airplanes had been hijacked. They knew that one plane had been flown deliberat ely into the World Trade Cent er's Nort h Tower; a second plane was wildly off course and also heading toward Manhat tan. ... So why, at 9:03 AM—f ifteen minut es after it was clear the Unit ed States was under terrorist attack—did President Bush sit down wit h a classroom of second -graders and begin a 20 - minut e pre -planned phot o op ? > 8 Bush's behavior is made even more ast ounding by the fact that his Secret Service would have had to assume that he was one of the intended target s. Indeed, one Secret Service agent , seeing the television coverage of the crash of the second airliner into the WTC, report edly said:"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"\"We're out of here. \" > 9 But if one of the agent s act ually said this, he was obviously overruled. At the same time, by cont rast , Cheney and Rice were report edly being rushed to bunkers under the Whit e House. > 10 And yet , \"For some reason, Secret Service agent s [do] not hust le [Bush] away, \" comment s the Globe and Mail ''Why doesn't this happen to Bush at the same time ?\" Thompson asks. \"Why doesn't the Secret Service move Bush away from his known locat ion ?\" > 11 The reason for pressing this quest ion is that , as Wood and Thompson point out : \"Hijackers could have crashed a plane into Bush's publicized locat ion and his securit y would have been complet ely helpless to stop it.\" > 12 This apparent ly unconcerned behavior, crit ics point out , cont inued for almost an hour. The intelligence expert James Bamf ord has writ ten: [H]aving just been told that the count ry was under attack, the Commander in Chief appeared unint erest ed in furt her det ails. He never asked if there had been any addit ional threat s, where the art acks were coming from, how to best prot ect me count ry from furt her attacks. ... Inst ead, in the middle of a modern -day Pearl Harbor, he simply turned back to the mat ter at hand: the day's phot o op. > 13 This phot o opport unit y involved, as indicat ed above, the president 's list ening to second graders read a book about a pet goat . After Bush had been in the classroom a few minut es, his chief of staff, Andrew Card came in and whispered in his ear, report edly telling him about the second attack. But the president , after a brief pause, had the children go ahead wit h the reading demonst rat ion. To emphasize the strangeness of this behavior, Bamf ord adds this ref lect ion: As President Bush cont inued wit h his reading lesson, life wit hin the burning towers of the World Trade Cent er was becoming ever more desperat e.... Wit hin minut es, people began jumping, pref erring a quick deat h to burning alive or suf focat ing. > 14 While this was going on, the president was list ening to the student s read: \"The -Pet -Goat . A-girl - got -a-pet -goat . But -the -goat -did -some -things -that -made -the -girls -dad -mad. \" After list ening to this for several minut es, President Bush made a joke, saying: \"Really good readers, whew! These must be sixt h graders! \" > 15 Anot her person who has found the cont rast bet ween the president s behavior and what was happening in New York troubling is Lorie van Auken, whose husband was one of the vict ims of the attacks on the towers. Having obt ained the video of the president s session wit h the children, she wat ched it over and over, saying later: \"I couldn't stop wat ching the president sitting there, list ening to second graders, while my husband was burning in a building. \" Also, not ing that the president had just been told by an advisor that the count ry was under attack, she wondered how the president could make a joke. > 16 Besides joking, the president lingered, not at all act ing like a commander in chief wit h an emergency on his hands. Indeed, according to a book called Fight ing Back by the Whit e House correspondent for the Washingt on Times, Bill Sammon—a book that present s the Whit e House perspect ive on most issues and generally provides an ext remely sympat het ic account of the president > 17—Bush was \"openly stret ching out the moment .\" When the lesson was over, according to Sammon's account , Bush said: Hoo! These are great readers. Very impressive! Thank you all so much for showing me your reading skills. I bet they pract ice too. Don't you ? Reading more than they wat ch TV ? Anybody do that ? Read more than you wat ch TV ? [Hands go up] Oh that 's great ! Very good. Very import ant to pract ice! Thanks for having me. Very impressed. > 18 Bush then cont inued to talk, advising the children to stay in school and be good citizens. And in response to a quest ion, he talked about his educat ion policy. \" Sammon describes Bush as smiling and chat ting wit h the children \"as if he didn't have a care in the world\" and \"in the most relaxed manner imaginable. \" After a report er asked if the president had heard about what had happened in New York, Bush said, \"I'll talk about it later, \" then, in Sammons words, \"st epped forward and shook hands wit h [the classroom teacher] Daniels, slipping his left hand behind her in anot her phot o-op pose. He was taking his good old time. ... Bush lingered unt il the press was gone. \" Sammon, in fact , ref ers to the president as \"the dawdler in chief .\" > 20 Amazingly, perhaps stung by the crit icisms of the president 's behavior, the Whit e House put out a different account a year later. Andrew Card, Bush's chief of staff, was quot ed as saying that after he told the president about the second attack on the World Trade Cent er, Bush \"excused himself very polit ely to the teacher and to the student s\" and left the classroom wit hin \"a mat ter of seconds. \" > 21 In an alternat ive wording of the new story, Card said, \"Not that many seconds later the president excused himself from the classroom. \" > 22 Apparent ly, say crit ics, the Whit e House was so conf ident that none of its lies about 9/11 would be challenged by the media that it felt saf e telling this one even though it is flatly cont radict ed by Sammons pro -Bush book and by the video"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"tape produced that day, which, as Wood and Thompson put it, \"shows these statement s are lies —unless 'a mat ter of seconds' means over 700 seconds! \"23 In any case, back to real hist ory, the president finally left the classroom at 9:16 to meet wit h his advisors, report edly to prepare his television address to the nat ion, which he delivered at 9:29. Thompson comment s: \"The talk occurs at exact ly the time and place stated in his publicly announced advance schedule—making Bush a possible terrorist target .\" > 24 And not only Bush. When Andrew Card and Karl Rove were later asked why the president had not left the classroom as soon as he had word of the second attack, their answer, Wood and Thompson point out , was that he did not want to upset the children. But , they ask, \"why didn't Bush's concern for the children ext end to not making them and the rest of the 200 or so people at the school terrorist target s?\" > 25 Might the answer be that Bush knew that there was really no danger ? In any case, the president and his people then went in their scheduled mot orcade on their scheduled rout e to the airport , during which they report edly learned that the Pent agon had been struck and also heard that the president 's plane, Air Force One, was a terrorist target . Nevert heless no milit ary escort was ordered. \"Amazingly, \" says Thompson, \"his plane takes off wit hout any fight ers prot ect ing it,\" > 26 This seems especially surprising given the feet that there were still over 3,000 planes in the air over the Unit ed States and there was no way to know at that time how many airlines had been hijacked. For example, about an hour later, Thompson report s, the FAA had said that there were six missing aircraf t— a figure that Cheney subsequendy ment ioned—and at one time eleven flight s were suspect ed of having been hijacked. > 27 According to Karl Rove, furt hermore, the Secret Service had learned of \"a specif ic threat made to Air Force One. \" > 28 So, why had fight er jets not been ordered from one of the two nearby milit ary bases, which have fight ers on 24 - hour alert ? > 29 The strangeness of the president 's behavior, given the apparent circumst ances, has not gone unnot iced by family members of the vict ims of the attacks of 9/11. For example, Krist en Breit weiser, whose quest ion about how a plane could have struck the Pent agon was quot ed earlier, also said: It was clear that we were under attack. Why didn't the Secret Service whisk him out of that school ? He was on live local television in Florida. The terrorist s, you know, had been in Florida. ... I want to know why he sat there for 25 minut es. > 30 Much attent ion at the time was given to the fact that once Air Force Onebecame airborne at 9:55, President Bush remained away from Washingt on for a long time, perhaps, speculat ed some comment ators, out of fear. Indeed, some report ers who crit icized the president on that score lost their jobs > 31—which may account for why the Whit e House could later be conf ident that the news media would not challenge any of its fabricat ions. In any case, the real quest ion, the crit ics suggest , is why there was apparent ly no fear during the first hour. The implied quest ion is, of course, a dist urbing one: Did the president and at least the head of his Secret Service det ail know that he was not a target ? The idea that the Bush administ iarion had advance knowledge of the attacks is furt her suggest ed by a statement later made by Bush himslef : \"I was sitting out side the classroom wait ing to go in,\" he claimed, \"and I saw an airplane hit the tower—t he TV was obviously on, and I used to fly myself , and I said, There's one terrible pilot .\" > 32 Given the fact that according to the official story, Bush did not have access to a television set unt il at least 15 minut es later, > 33 this statement raised quest ions. An art icle in the Bost on Herald said: Think about that . Bush's remark implies he saw the first plane hit the tower. But we all know that video of the first plane hitting did not surf ace unt il the next day. Could Bush have meant he saw the second plane hit—which many Americans wit nessed ? No, because he said that he was in the classroom when Card whispered in his ear that a second plane hit. Point ing out that Bush had told this story several times, the writ er asked: \"How could the Commander -in -chief have seen the plane fly into the first building—as it happened ?\" > 34 This is an excellent quest ion. But it is simply one of many excellent quest ions mat have been raised by individual report ers and then allowed to die by the rest of the news media. They have not pressed for an answer. Thierry Meyssan, however, has suggest ed a possible answer. Point ing out that \"according to his own declarat ion, the President of the Unit ed States saw pict ures of the first crash bef ore the second had taken place, \" Meyssan emphasizes the fact that the pict ures report edly seen by Bush could not have been \"those accident ally filmed by French document ary -makers Jules and Gédéon Naudet ,\" because \"their video was not released unt il thirt een hours later. \" On the morning of 9/11, theref ore, Bush could not have seen the pict ures of the first crash that we have all seen time and time again. Theref ore, Meyssan suggest s, the pict ures must"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"have been secret images transmit ted to him wit hout delay in the secure communicat ions room that was inst alled in the element ary school in preparat ion for his visit . But if the US intelligence services could have filmed the first attack, that means they must have been informed bef orehand. > 35 Meyssans suggest ion, in other words, is that although the president did not see the plane fly into the first building \"as it happened, \" he did see it, as he claimed, bef ore he went into the classroom. ======================== According to crit ics of the official account , in sum, the behaviour of President Bush on 9/11 reinf orces the conclusion, inferable from the fate of the four crashed airliners, that government and milit ary officials at the highest level had advance knowledge of, and conspired to allow; the traumat ic event s of that day. > 36 Wit h regard to our list of possible views, furt hermore, the crit ical account of the president 's behaviour seems to eliminat e the first five possible views, according to which the Whit e House had no expect ation of any attacks. The behavior of President Bush and his Secret Service seems to imply at least the sixt h view, according to which the Whit e House expect ed some sort of arracks. Furt hemore, if we accept Meyssans conject ure about Bush's statement that he saw the first WTC crash on television bef ore ent ering the classroom, the sevent h view—according to which the Whit e House had foreknowledge of the target s and the timing of the attacks—is suggest ed. That view is also suggest ed by the evidence that President Bush and his Secret Service seemed to know that they would not be target s of the attack. For the crit ics of the official account , this conclusion for some sort of official complicit y is made even stronger when the event s of 9/11 are seen in me larger cont ext provided by informat ion about relevant event s bot h prior to and after 9/11.

Finally, on Sept ember 26, CBS News laid the story to rest wit h this explanat ion: \"Sources say Whit e House staffers apparent ly misunderst ood comment s made by their securit y det ail. \" Slat e magazine gave its \"Whopper of the Week\" award to Cheney, Fleischer, and Rove (Slat e, Sept ember 28, 2001). Unf ort unat ely, Thierry Meyssan, having evident ly missed the ret ract ion, based his most speculat ive theory on this bogus report (9/ 11: The Big Lie, Ch. 3: \"Moles in the Whit e House\"). But he can perhaps be forgiven, since CBS, evident ly forget ting about its own debunking, revived the story a year later (CBS, Sept ember 11, 2002, cited in Wood and Thompson, under \"Rewrit ing Hist ory\"). 29 Wood and Thompson, under \"Air Force One Takes OffWit hout Fight er Escort .\" 30 Krist en Breit weiser's comment s, made on Phil Donahue's television show on August 13, 2002, are quot ed in Thompson, \"Timeline, \" August 13, 2002. 31 Washingt on Post , Sept ember 29, 2001, cited in Wood and Thompson, introduct ory discussion. 32 CNN December 4, 2001, quot ed in Thompson (9: 01 AM). 33 Washingt on Times, Oct ober 7, 2002, quot ed in Thompson (9: 01 AM). 34 Bost on Herald, Oct ober 22, 2002, quot ed in Thompson (9: 01 AM). 35 Meyssan, 9/11: The Big Lie, 38 -39.

PART TWO THE LARGER CONTEXT CHAPTER FIVE DID US OFFI CIALS HAVE ADVANCE INFORMATI ON ABOUT 9/11 ?"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"The larger cont ext for viewing the event s of 9/11, according to crit ics of the official account , consist s of four more types of evidence against that account . In this chapt er, I explore the first type: evidence that US officials had informat ion about the attacks bef ore they happened. Many leading officials in the Bush administ rat ion have claimed that the event s of 9/11 were complet ely unant icipat ed. For example, Condoleezza Rice, Bush's Nat ional Securit y Advisor, said in May of 2002: \"I don't think anybody could have predict ed that these people would take an airplane and slam it into the World Trade Cent er, take anot her one and slam it into the Pent agon, that they would try to use. ..a hijacked airplane as a missile. \" > 1 The next mont h, President Bush, in an address to the nat ion, said: \"Based on everyt hing I've seen, I do not believe anyone could have prevent ed the horror of Sept ember the 11 th.\" > 2 A furt her claim, endorsed in the summary of the final report of the Joint Inquiry conduct ed by the intelligence commit tees of the US Senat e and House of Represent atives, is that although there were some indicat ions of plans for terrorist attacks wit hin the Unit ed States, \"it was the general view of the Intelligence Communit y, in the spring and summer of 2001, that the threat ened bin Laden attacks would most likely occur against US interest s overseas. \" > 3 These general claims can be divided into two more part icular ones, each of which has been challenged by crit ics of the official account . Was the Very Possi bility of Such Attacks not Envi sioned ? One of these claims is that the very possibilit y that someone would use planes as weapons had not been imagined. For example, a def ense official was quot ed as saying: \"I don't think any of us envisioned an internal air threat by big aircraf t. I don't know of anybody that ever thought through that .\" > 4 About a year later, Whit e House Press Secret ary Ari Fleischer said: \"Unt il the attack took place, i think it's fair to say that no one envisioned that as a possibilit y. Crit ics say, however, that there is much evidence to the cont rary. For example, in 1993 a panel of expert s commissioned by the Pent agon suggest ed that airplanes could be used as missiles to bomb nat ional landmarks. However, this not ion was not published in its report , Terror 2000, because, said one of its aut hors: \"We were told by the Depart ment of Def ense not to put it in.\" But in 1994, one of these expert s wrot e in the Fut urist magazine: Target s such as the World Trade Cent er not only provide the requisit e casualt ies but , because of their symbolic nat ure, provide more bang for the buck. In order to maximize their odds for success, terrorist groups will likely consider mount ing mult iple, simult aneous operat ions. > 6 In that same year, there were three airplanes hijacked wit h the intent to use them as weapons, including a highly publicized plan of a terrorist group linked wit h al-Qaeda to crash one into the Eif fel Tower. In 1995, Senat or Sam Nunn, in Time magazines cover story, described a scenario in which terrorist s crash a radio -cont rolled airplane into the US Capit ol building. > 7 The year 1995 also brought the most import ant discovery, which has been widely report ed: Philippine police found an al-Qaeda comput er wit h a plan called Project Bojinka, one version of which involved hijacking planes and flying them into target s such as the World Trade Cent er, the Whit e House, CIA headquart ers, and the Pent agon. This plan—which was evident ly formulat ed by Khalid Shaikh Mohammed (lat er to be ident ified as the mast ermind of 9/11) and his relat ive Ramsi Yousef > 8—resurf aced in the 1996 trial of the latter for mast erminding the 1993 attack on the World Trade Cent er (in which Mohammed was also indict ed). > 5 (Not e: Ramsi Youssef was NOT charged wit h the 1993 attack on the WTC, there is an mp3 of his lawyer talking publicly about it on the web. It is now est ablished that a FBI [double -?]agent inst igat ed that attack. ) Yousef 's convict ion, Ahmed point s out , was on Sept ember 11, 1996, so that 9/11 was its fifth anniversary. .\" Furt hermore, after the attacks, report s Thompson, a Philippine invest igat or said: \"It's Bojinka. .. We told the Americans everyt hing about Bojinka. Why didn't they pay attent ion ? \" > 11 In 1999, the Nat ional Intelligence Council, which advise the President and US intelligence agencies on emerging threat s, said in a special report on terrorism: Al-Qaeda's expect ed ret aliat ion for the US cruise missile attack [of 1998] ...could take several forms of terrorist attack in the nat ion's capit ol. Suicide bombers belonging to al-Qaeda's Mart yrdom Bat talion could crash -land an aircraf t packed wit h high explosives. ..into the Pent agon, the headquart ers of the Cent ral Intelligence Agency (CI A), or the Whit e House. > 12 Wit h regard to the Pent agon in part icular, officials in Oct ober of 2000 carried out an emergency drill to prepare for the possibilit y that a hijacked airliner might be crashed into the Pent agon. > 13 In sum, argue crit ics, the claim that the possibilit y of such attacks had not been envisioned is clearly unt rue."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Were There No Speci fic Warni ngs about the Attacks ? A second, narrower claim is that although there were warnings about the possibilit y of this kind of attack, there were no specif ic warnings relat ing to 9/11. For example, three days afterwards, FBI Direct or Robert Mueller (six days in office) said: \"There were no warning signs that I'm aware of that would indicat e this type of operat ion in the count ry. \" > 14 A year later, he still claimed: \"To this day we have found no one in the Unit ed States except the act ual hijackers who knew of the plot .\" > 15 Accept ance of this claim is ref lect ed in the summary of the final report of the Joint Inquiry conduct ed by the House and Senat e intelligence commit tees. The first \"finding\" report ed in this summary reads: While the Intelligence Communit y had amassed a great deal of valuable intelligence regarding Usama Bin Laden and his terrorist act ivit ies, none of it ident ified the time, place, and specif ic nat ure of the attack that were planned for Sept ember 11, 2001. [ Aut hor's not e: Spellings of his name shif t due to different styles of translit erat ing the Arabic into English. ] Indeed, as we saw earlier, this summary of the Joint Inquiry's final report said that the informat ion led the intelligence communit y to expect the attacks to be direct ed \"against US interest s overseas. \" But in fact , crit ics argue, there were evident ly many quit e specif ic warnings in the mont hs leading up to 9/11 and, given the fact that by May of 2001, warnings of an attack against the US were report edly higher than ever bef ore, US intelligence agencies should have been especially on the alert . > 16 This state of alert should have been increased still furt her, one would assume, given the fact that an intelligence summary for Condoleezza Rice from CIA Direct or George Tenet on June 28 said: \"It is highly likely that a signif icant al-Qadea attack is in the near future, wit hin several weeks. \" > 17 It was in such a cont ext that the rat her specif ic warnings came. In late July, for example, the Taliban's Foreign Minist er informed US officials that Osama ben Laden was planning a \"huge attack\" inside America that was imminent and would kill thousands. > 18 That the informat ion indicat ed that the attack was to involve commercial airlines is suggest ed by the fact that on July 26, CBS News report ed that Attorney General Ashcrof t had decided to quit using this mode of travel because of a threat assessment —alt hough \"neit her the FBI nor the Just ice Depart ment —would ident ify what the threat was, when it was det ect ed or who made it.\" > 19 In May of 2002, it was claimed that the threat assessment had not hing to do wit h al-Qaeda, but Ashcrof t, according to the Associat ed Press, walked out of his office rat her than answer quest ions about it. The San Francisco Chronicle complained: \"The FBI obviously knew somet hing was in the wind. ... The FBI did advise Ashcrof t to stay off commercial aircraf t. The rest of us just had to take our chances. \" CBS's Dan Rat her later asked, wit h regard to this warning: \"Why wasn't it shared wit h the public at large ?\" > 20 August and Sept ember brought more warnings. A Moroccan agent who had penet rat ed al-Qaeda was evident ly brought to the Unit ed States to discuss his report that bin Laden, being disappoint ed that the 1993 bombing had not toppled the \"WTC, planned \"large scale operat ions in New York in the summer or fall of 2001. \" > 21 Former CIA agent Robert Baer report edly told the CIAs Count er-Terrorism Cent er that he had learned from a milit ary associat e of a Persian Gulf prince that a \"spect acular terrorist operat ion\" was about to take place. > 22 Some warnings, furt hermore, were report edly given by several foreign intelligence agencies. For example, Russian President Put in later stated that in August , \"I ordered my intelligence to warn President Bush in the strongest terms that 25 terrorist s were get ting ready to attack the US, including import ant government buildings like the Pent agon. \" The head of Russian intelligence also said: \"We had clearly warned them\" on several occasions, but they \"did not pay the necessary attent ion. \" > 23 Warnings were also report edly given by Jordan, Egypt , and Israel, > 24 wit h the latter count ry warning, a few days bef ore 9/11, that perhaps 200 terrorist s linked to Osama bin Laden were \"preparing a big operat ion. \" > 25 One of the official warnings during this period became widely known—a memo provided by Great Brit ain, which was included in the intelligence brief ing for President Bush on August 6. This warning said that al-Qeda had planned an attack in the Unit ed States involving mult iple airplane hijackings. The Whit e House kept this warning secret , wit h the president repeat edly claiming after 9/11 that he had received no warning of any kind. But on May 15, 2002, CBS Evening News revealed the exist ence of this memo from Brit ish intelligence. Condoleezza Rice tried to dismiss its signif icance by saying that it was \"fuzzy and thin, \" consist ing of only a page and a half . Newspaper account s, however, said that it was 11 pages long. > 26 Press Secret ary Ari Fleischer said in no uncert ain terms: \"The president did not —not —receive informat ion about the use of airplanes as missiles by suicide bombers. \" > 27 A few days later, however, the Guardian report ed that \"the [August 6] memo left little doubt that the hijacked airliners were intended for use as missiles and that intended target s were to be inside the US. \" > 28 Doubt about the administ rat ions"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"trut hfulness is raised by the fact that it has ref used to release the memo while claiming that there is not hing specif ic in it. As Michael Moore has asked: \"If there is not hing specif ic, then why cant they release it?\" > 29 In any case, if that informat ion is still considered too general to have made the event s of 9/11 prevent able, even more specif ic informat ion was provided by the stock market . Intelligence agencies monit or the stock market , crit ics point out , to wat ch for clues of impending cat ast rophes. And the days just bef ore Sept ember 11 saw an ext remely high volume of \"put opt ions\" purchased for the stock of Morgan Stanley Dean Wit ter, which occupied 22 stories of the World Trade Cent er, and for Unit ed and American Airlines, the two airlines used in the attacks. > 30 For these two airlines, and only these two, \"the level of these trades was up by 1,200 percent in the three days prior to the World Trade Cent er attacks. \" > 31 To buy a put opt ion is to bet that the price of shares is going to go down, and in this case the bet was highly prof itable. As the San Francisco Chronicle explained: \"When the stock prices. ..dropped. ..in response to the terrorist attacks, the opt ions mult iplied a hundredf old in value, making millions of dollars in prof it.\" If a single group of speculat ors purchased most of the thousands of put opt ions for those three stocks, this group would have made over $10 million. This unusual set of purchases \"raises suspicions that the invest ors. ..had advance knowledge of the strikes. \" > 32 Even more import ant here is the conclusion that any intelligence officer looking at this development , especially in light of all the warnings, would easily have concluded that someone wit h inside informat ion knew that in the near future bot h American and Unit ed airplanes were going to be used in attacks, quit e likely on the World Trade Cent er. And there can be no serious doubt , Ahmed adds, that intelligence officers monit or the market looking for such anomalies. He quot es invest igat ive journalist Michael Ruppert , a former det ect ive for the Los Angeles Police Depart ment , who wrot e: \"It is well document ed that the CIA has long monit ored such trades—in real time—as pot ent ial warnings of terrorist attacks and other economic moves cont rary to US interest s.\" Ahmed adds that \"[t]he UPI also report ed that the US -sponsored ECHELON intelligence net work closely monit ors stock trading. \" > 33 An intriguing foot not e to this story is that A. B. \"Buzzy\" Krongard, who in March of 2001 was promot ed wit hin the CIA by President Bush to become its execut ive direct or, had unt il 1998 been the manager of Deut sche Bank, one of the major banks through which put opt ions on Unit ed Airlines were purchased. > 34 The implicat ion, of course, is that there might have been insider trading going on that dwarf ed Mart ha Stewart 's in size and signif icance. In any case, furt her specif ic informat ion, crit ics cont inue, was evidendy obt ained from elect ronic intercept s. Shordy bef ore 9/11, the FBI report edly intercept ed messages such as \"There is a big thing coming\" and \"They're going to pay the price. \" > 35 On Sept ember 9, a foreign intelligence service report edly passed on to US intelligence an intercept ed message from bin Laden to his mot her, in which he told her: In two days you're going to hear big news, and you're not going to hear from me for a while. \" > 36 And the next day, Sept ember 10, US intelligence report edly obt ained elect ronic intercept s of conversat ions in which al Queda members said: \"Tomorrow will be a great day for us. \" > 37 One of those intercept s was report edly made by the Nat ional Securit y Agency (NSA), which had monit ored a call during the summer bet ween Mohamed Atta and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, believed to be one of the archit ect s of Project Bojinka, the 1993 bombing of the WTC, and the bombing of the USS Cole. > 38 In the intercept of Sept ember 10, 2001, Atta report edly received final approval for the 9/11 attacks from Mohammed. According to the Sept ember 15, 2002 story in the Independent that report ed this intercept , informat ion as to when the intercept was translat ed had not been released. > 39 But given the fact that US intelligence had learned in June of 2001 that Khalid Shaikh Mohammed was interest ed in \"sending terrorist s to the Unit ed States, \" > 40 one would assume that translat ing an intercept ed message from him would have had the highest priorit y. US intelligence agencies, however, would later claim that the highly specif ic messages received the two days bef ore 9/11 were not translat ed unt il afterwards. In relat ion to this claim, it is signif icant , as Thompson point s out , that Senat or Orrin Hat ch report ed that US officials had overheard two bin Laden aides celebrat ing the successf ul terrorist attack At a news brief ing on Sept ember 12, Secret ary of Def ense Rumsf eld report edly manif est ed chagrin at Hat ch's breach, which revealed that the US government was, in fact , monit oring these communicat ions elect ronically in real time. > 41 The idea that specif ic informat ion was not only received but also translat ed on Sept ember 10 is furt her suggest ed by Newsweek's report that on that day \"a group of top Pent agon officials suddenly canceled travel plans for the next morning, apparent ly because of securit y concerns. \" > 42 Wit h this informat ion bef ore us, we can bet ter evaluat e the Joint Inquiry's final report , as ref lect ed in its summary, according to which none of the informat ion available to the intelligence communit y \"ident ified the time, place, and specif ic nat ure of the attacks that were planned for Sept ember 11, 2001. \" The Joint Inquiry evident ly tried to reconcile this finding wit h the kind of very specif ic informat ion reviewed above by saying: \"In the period from Sept ember 8 to Sept ember 10, 2001,"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"NSA intercept ed, but did not translat e or disseminat e unt il after Sept ember 11, some communicat ions that indicat ed possible impending terrorist act ivit y.\" > 43 It would be interest ing to know, however, whet her this conclusion was based on any evidence other than test imony by members of the NSA. It would also be interest ing to know whet her the Joint Inquiry tried to explain why on Sept ember 10 \"a group of top Pent agon officials suddenly canceled travel plans for the next morning. \" And whet her they asked why, given the many very specif ic report s prior to Sept ember 8, the NSA was not translat ing and disseminat ing the warnings it intercept ed from Sept ember 8 to 10—in other words, whet her the claim that it did not do so is really believable. In any case, Ahmed, ref erring to Condoleezza Rice's statement that US officials had no specif ic informat ion about the attacks in advance, concludes that it is \"pat endy false. \" > 44 Michel Chossudovsky, ref erring to the discussion of whet her members of the Bush administ rat ion knew about the attacks bef orehand, says: \"Of course they knew! \"—adding that \"the American people have been consciously and deliberat ely deceived. \" > 45 Crit ics of the official account have cert ainly provided evidence that seems to support these conclusions. The mat erial in this chapt er provides, at the very least , furt her evidence against the first two of the possible views, according to which US intelligence agencies had no specif ic informat ion about the attacks. Some of this evidence, furt hermore, seems to rule out the first six views, according to which at least the Whit e House had no specif ic knowledge about the impending attacks. All the views except the sevent h and the eight h, accordingly, would seem to be ruled out insof ar as the evidence summarized in this chapt er stands up to furt her scrut iny. The cumulat ive evidence of government complicit y becomes even more compelling, crit ics of the official account of 9/11 believe, when it includes evidence that US officials act ively obst ruct ed invest igat ions that might have uncovered the plot .

CHAPTER SIX DID US OFFI CIALS OBSTRUCT INVESTI GATI ONS PRI OR TO 9/11 ?"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"When informat ion of some of the warnings discussed in the previous chapt er leaked out , US officials dismissed the import ance of these warnings by claiming that there is always so much intelligence coming in that it is often difficult to dist inguish the signif icant informat ion from the \"noise, \" meaning all the report s that turn out to be false or insignif icant . After a cat ast rophe such as 9/11 happens, they say, it is unf air to pick out those few bits of informat ion relat ed to it and claim, wit h 20/ 20 hindsight , that officials should have been able to \"connect the dot s.\" However, say crit ics, even if that argument could legit imat ely be used to dismiss the warnings discussed in the previous chapt er (which, they maint ain, it could not ), the fact of official complicit y would be strongly suggest ed if there is evidence that government al agencies had purposely prevent ed invest igat ions of al-Qaeda and individuals thought to be connect ed to it. And, they claim, such evidence does exist . The Anti -Hunt for Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda One of the main reasons for doubt ing the official story about 9/11, say crit ics, is evidence that , far from doing everyt hing it could to kill or capt ure bin Laden, US government officials repeat edly failed to do so when they had opport unit ies. I will summarize a few of the episodes that have been dug up by Ahmed and Thompson. In December of 1998, CIA Direct or George Tenet report edly circulat ed a memorandum in the intelligence communit y that said: \"We are at war, \" and added: \"I want no resources or people spared in this effort , either inside CIA or the [larger intelligence] communit y.\" But the Congressional Joint Inquiry would later learn that there was no signif icant shif t in budget or personnel and that few FBI agent s had ever heard of the declarat ion. > 1 On December 20 of 2000 Richard Clarke, a count er-terrorism expert , submit ted a plan to roll back al-Qaeda in response to the bombing of the USS Cole (which had occurred in Oct ober). The main component of Clarke's plan was a dramat ic increase in covert act ion in Afghanist an to \"eliminat e the sanct uary\" for bin Laden. The Clint on administ rat ion, on the grounds that the Bush admimst rat ion would be taking over in only a few weeks, passed the plan on to it. In January however, the Bush administ rat ion reject ed the plan and took no act ion. > 2 According to a story report ed by ABC News, Julie Sirrs, an agent for the Def ense Intelligence Agency (DI A), traveled to Afghanist an twice in 2001. On her first trip, she met wit h Nort hern Alliance leader Ahmad Masood. > 3 On her second trip, she ret urned home wit h what she later called \"a treasure trove of informat ion, \" including evidence that bin Laden was planning to assassinat e Masood (and Masood would indeed be assassinat ed on Sept ember 9, as discussed in Chapt er 8). But she was met at the airport by a securit y officer, who conf iscat ed her mat erial, after which the DIA and the FBI invest igat ed her. However, she said, no higher intelligence officials want ed to hear what she had learned in Afghanist an. Finally, her securit y clearance was pulled and she resigned from the DIA. > 4 In March of 2001, the Russian Permanent Mission at the Unit ed Nat ions secret ly submit ted \"an unprecedent edly det ailed report \" to the UN Securit y Council about bin Laden and his whereabout s, including \"a list ing of all bin Laden's bases, his government cont act s and foreign advisors\"—enough informat ion, they said, to kill him. But the Bush administ rat ion took no act ion. Alex Standish, the edit or of Jane's Intelligence Review, would later conclude that the attacks of 9/11 were not an intelligence failure but the result of \"a polit ical decision not to act against bin Laden. \" > 5 By the summer of 2001, Osama bin Laden was America's \"most want ed\" criminal, for whom it was offering a $5 million bount y, and the US government had supposedly tried to kill him. And yet in July according to report s by several of Europe's most respect ed news sources, bin Laden spent two weeks in the American hospit al in Dubai (of the Unit ed Arab Emirat es). Besides being treat ed by an American surgeon, Dr. Terry Callaway, he was also report edly visit ed by the head of Saudi intelligence and, on July 12, by the localCI A agent , Larry Mit chell. Alt hough the report s were denied by the CIA, the hospit al, and bin Laden himself , Dr. Callaway report edly simply ref used comment , and the news agencies stood by their story. > 6 \"The explosive story, \" comment s Thompson, was \"widely report ed in Europe, but barely at all in the US. \" > 7 After this story broke in November Chossudovsky, quot ing Secret ary of Def ense Rumsf eld's comment that finding binLaden would be like \"searching for a needle in a stack of hay, \" said: \"But the US could have ordered his arrest and ext radit ion in Dubai last July. But then they would not have had a pret ext for waging a war. \" > 8 Hidden Connecti ons between Bush, bin Laden, and Saudi Royal s One of the dist urbing quest ions that has been raised by crit ics of the official account is whet her the act ual relat ions bet ween the Bush administ rat ion, Osama bin Laden, and the Saudi Royal family are not rat her different from the public port rayal of these relat ions. There are several"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"grounds for suspicion. First , the bin Laden family—one of the wealt hiest and most influent ial families in Saudi Arabia—and the Bush family had business relat ions for over 20 years. > 9 Second, although Osama binLadin has been port rayed as the black sheep of the family who was disowned for his terrorist ways—so that the \"good bin Ladens\" could be radically dist inguished from the \"bad bin Laden\"—t here is much evidence that Osama's close ties wit h his family cont inued. > 10 Third, there is evidence that Osama bin Laden cont inued to receive covert aid from America's close ally, Saudi Arabia. > 11 A fourt h ground for suspicion is the report that immediat ely after 9/11, the US government , working wit h the Saudi government , helped many members of the bin Laden family depart from the Unit ed States, even allowing their jets to fly bef ore the nat ional air ban was lifted. > 12 A fifth cause for suspicion is the fact that when the final report of the Joint Inquiry into 9/11 carried out by the House and Senat e intelligence commit tees was finally released in 2003, the administ rat ion had insist ed on blocking out some 28 pages, which report edly dealt primarily wit h Saudi Arabia. There is, finally, the simple fact that most of the alleged hijackers were from Saudi Arabia. These grounds for suspicion are, furt hermore, support ed by report s from credible people about cont inuing ties bet ween the Saudi government , Osama bin Laden, and al-Qaeda. On August 22, 2001, John O'Neill, a count er-terrorism expert who was said to be the US government s \"most commmed tracker of Osama bin Ladeen and his al-Qaeda net work of terrorist s,\" resigned from the FBI , citing repeat ed obst ruct ion of his invest igat ions into al- Qaeda. > 13 The previous mont h, O'Neill, who held one of the top posit ions in the FBI had report edly complained of obst ruct ion by the Whit e House, saying that the main obst acles to invest igat ing al-Qaeda were \"US Oil corporat e interest s and the role played by Saudi Arabia. \" He then added: \"All the answers, everyt hing needed to dismant le Osama bin Laden's organizat ion, can be found in Saudi Arabia. \" > 14 O'Neill's assessment , Ahmed comment s, was given support by Tariq Ali, who wrot e: \"Bin Laden and his gang are just the tent acles [of the Wahhabi oct opus] ; the head lies saf ely in Saudi Arabia, prot ect ed by US forces. \" > 15 The idea that any serious invest igat ion would need to focus on Saudi Arabia has, interest ingly, been support ed more recent ly by Gerald Posner, an aut hor who on most point s support s the official account of 9/11. > 16 On the basis of informat ion provided anonymously but independent ly by two sources in the US government , Possner report s on the US interrogat ion of the Saudi Arabian Abu Zubaydah, one of al- Qaeda's top operat ives, who was capt ured in Pakist an late in March of 2002. The interrogat ion, aided by thiopent al sodium (Sodium Pent othal), was carried out by two Arab - Americans pret ending to be Saudi Arabians. Relieved to be in the presence of men he believed to be fellow count rymen, Zubaydah became very talkat ive. > 17 Hoping to save himself , Zubaydah claimed that he, as a member of al-Qaeda, had been working on behalf of senior Saudi officials. Encouraging his interrogat ors to conf irm his claim, he told them to call one of King Fahd's nephews, Prince Ahmed bin Salman bin Abdul -Aziz (chairman of a huge publishing empire and founder of the Thoroughbred Corporat ion, which produced Kent ucky Derby winner War Emblem). Zubaydah even gave them Prince Ahmed's telephone numbers from memory. When his interrogat ors said that 9/11 had surely changed everyt hing, so that Prince Ahmed would no longer be support ive of al-Qaeda, Zubaydah told them that it would not have changed anyt hing, because Prince Ahmed had known in advance that America would be attacked on 9/11. Zubaydah also gave from memory the phone numbers of two other relat ives of King Fahd's who could conf irm his claims: Prince Sult an bin Faisal bin Turki al-Saud and Prince Fahd bin Turki bin Saud al-Kabir. Less than four mont hs later, event s occurred that suggest ed to Posner that Zubaydah's test imony may have been true. Wit hin an eight -day period, all three of the named Saudis died. On July 22, Prince Ahmed, who was 43, report edly died of a heart attack. The next day, Prince Sult an bin Faisal, who was 41, report edly died in a single -car accident . And a week later, Prince Fahd bin Turki, who was 21, \"died of thirst .\" > 18 Zubaydah also said that he had been present at several meet ings bet ween Osama bin Laden and Prince Turki bin Faisal, the chief of Saudi intelligence, including a meet ing in Kandahar in 1998 at which Prince Turki promised that Saudis would cont inue to support the Taliban and would not ask for Osama's ext radit ion as long as al-Qaeda kept its promise not to attack the Saudi kingdom. But Prince Turki—who had been dismissed as head of Saudi intelligence ten days bef ore 9/11, after which he became the Saudi ambassador to Great Brit ain—survived the test imony about him. > 19 In any case, the account s of these interconnect ions bet ween Saudi royals, Osama bin Laden , and al-Qaeda suggest that the American failure to capt ure bin Laden may be connect ed wit h the close relat ions bet ween the Saudi royals, the bin Laden family, and the Bush administ rat ion. According to a story by invest igat ive report ers Gregory Palast and David Pallist er, US intelligence agent s, having long complained that they had been \"prevent ed for polit ical reasons from carrying out full invest igat ions into members of the bin Laden family, \" said that after the Bush administ rat ion took over, things had become worse—t hat they \"had been told to 'back off' from invest igat ions involving other members of the Bin Laden family [and] the Saudi royals. \" > 20 Palast , elaborat ing"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"on this point in an interview, stated: \"There is no quest ion we had what looked like the biggest failure of the intelligence communit y since Pearl Harbor but what we are learning now is it wasn't a failure, it was a direct ive. \" > 21 This conclusion is support ed by an American intelligence agent , who said: \"There were part icular invest igat ions [of the bin Laden family] that were effect ively killed. \" > 22 ============== It was not , however, only wit h regard to bin Laden and his family that invest igat ions were report edly stifled. Ahmed and Thompson point to several cases in which invest igat ions of other promising leads were apparent ly either obst ruct ed or not even init iated. These cases are especially pert inent to the Joint Inquiry's conclusion that the attacks of 9/11 were due to intelligence failures that were regret table but underst andable. While point ing out that the intelligence agencies had received more warnings than they had admit ted, the Joint Inquiry part ly let them off the hook by saying that although they had missed some import ant clues, \"They are the kinds of misses that happen when people ... are simply overwhelmed. \" > 23 In some of the following cases, agent s in the field were evident ly less overwhelmed than overruled. Ignori ng the FBI in Phoeni x On July 10, 2001, Phoenix FBI agent Ken Williams sent a now well -known memorandum to the count ert errorism division at FBI headquart ers, warning about suspicious act ivit ies involving a group of Middle East ern men who were taking flight training lessons. Williams had begun invest igat ing them in 2000, but early in 2001 he was reassigned to an arson case—leading a ret ired agent in Phoenix to writ e FBI Direct or Mueller after 9/11, asking: \"Why take your best terrorism invest igat or and put him on an arson case ?\" Williams had been back on the flight -school case for only a mont h when he wrot e his memo. Suggest ing that bin Ladens followers might be taking flying lessons for terrorist purposes, he recommended a nat ional program to track suspicious flight -school student s. FBI headquart ers, however, did not inst itute such a program. > 24 Blocki ng the FBI in Mi nneapol is In mid -August of 2001, the staff at a flight school in Minneapolis called the local FBI to report their suspicion that Zacarias Moussaoui, who had paid to train on a Boeing 747 simulat or, was planning to use a real 747 \"as a weapon. \" > 25 After the Minneapolis FBI agent s arrest ed Moussaoui and discovered many suspicious things about him, they asked FBI headquart ers for a warrant to search his lapt op comput er and other possessions. However, even though FBI headquart ers received addit ional informat ion about Moussaoui from France—which according to French officials clearly showed that he posed a threat > 26— senior FBI officials said that the informat ion \"was too sket chy to just ify a search warrant for his comput er. \" > 27 But the Minneapolis agent s, having seen the French intelligence report , were \"in a frenzy, \" wit h one agent speculat ing that Moussaoui might \"fly somet hing into the World Trade Cent er. \" > 28 Becoming \"desperat e to search the comput er lap top, \" the Minneapolis agent s sent a request through FBI headquart ers for a search warrant under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FI SA), which would be cert ain to grant it, because in the past its officials had grant ed virt ually all request s. > 29 At FBI headquart ers, however, the request was given to the Radical Fundament alist Unit (RFU), one of whose agent s crit icized the Minneapolis FBI supervisor for get ting people \"spun up\" over Moussaoui—but wit hout telling this supervisor about the memo from Ken Williams in Phoenix, which the head of the RFU had received. > 30 The Minneapolis request was then given to RFU agent Marion \"Spike\" Bowman, who lived up to his nickname by proceeding to remove the evidence that Moussaoui was connect ed to al-Qaeda through a rebel group in Chechnya. Then the FBI Deput y General Counsel, on the basis of this edit ed request , said that there was insuf ficient connect ion to al-Qaeda for a search warrant and did not even forward the request to FISA. > 31 Minneapolis FBI legal officer Coleen Rowley asked: \"Why would an FBI agent deliberat ely sabot age a case ?\" Other agent s in the Minneapolis office joked that those at headquart ers who blocked the request \"had to be spies or moles. ..working for Osama bin Laden, \" while one agent concluded that FBI headquart ers was \"set ting this up for failure. \" > 32 It is interest ing to compare this account of what happened wit h the \"finding\" in the Joint Inquiry's summary of its final report , which says that \"personnel at FBI Headquart ers, including the Radical Fundament alist Unit and the Nat ional Securit y Law Unit , as well as agent s in the Minneapolis field office, misunderst ood the legal standard for obt aining an order under FISA, \" having \"the percept ion. ..that the FISA process was lengt hy and fraught wit h peril. \" According to this finding, there was no sabot age, just misunderst anding all around, even in Minneapolis. Given the fact that this report was published many mont hs after Coleen Rowley's blist ering memo, discussed below, became part of the public record, it is puzzling how the Joint Inquiry could have thought that the agent s in Minneapolis were conf used. In any case, the Minneapolis FBI agent s were unable to examine Moussaoui's comput er and"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"other personal effect s unt il after the 9/11 attacks. > 33 Following that search, the former FBI Deput y Direct or said that the comput er cont ained \"not hing signif icant ...pert aining to 9/11, \" but the Washingt on Post cited congressional invest igat ors as saying that \"the evidence that lay unexamined in Zacarias Moussaouis possession was even more valuable than previously believed, \" as it connect ed him \"to the main hijacking cell in Hamburg\" and to \"an al-Qaeda associat e in Malaysia whose act ivit ies [had been] monit ored by the CIA.\" > 34 The New York Times concluded that the Moussaoui case \"raised new quest ions about why the Federal Bureau of Invest igat ion and other agencies did not prevent the hijackings. \" > 35 Three days after 9/11, FBI Direct or Mueller, who had only recent ly been appoint ed to this posit ion, made his previously quot ed statement : \"There were no warning signs that I'm aware of that would indicat e this type of operat ion in the count ry. \" Coleen Rowley and other Minneapolis agent s tried to reach his office to make him aware of the Moussaoui case so that his \"public statement s could be accordingly modif ied, \" yet Mueller cont inued to make similar comment s, including his test imony in a Senat e hearing on May 8, 2002, that \"there was not hing the agency could have done to ant icipat e and prevent the attacks. \" > 36 According to report s of this hearing, however, Mueller finally had to admit that a mont h bef ore 9/11, one FBI agent had speculat ed \"at a high -level meet ing that Moussaoui might have been taking lessons to enable him to crash an aircraf t into the World Trade Cent er in New York. \" > 37 Two weeks later, Rowley released a long memo she had writ ten about the FBI 's handling of the Moussaoui case, which Time magazine called a \"colossal indict ment of our chief law -enf orcement agency's neglect .\" > 38 After this memo became publicized, Mueller modif ied his public stance slight ly, saying: \"I cannot say for sure that there wasn't a possibilit y we could have come across some lead that would have led us to the hijackers. \" > 39 Blocki ng the FBI in Chi cago In 1998, FBI agent Robert Wright had begun tracking a terrorist cell in Chicago, suspect ing that money used for the 1998 bombings of US embassies came from a Saudi mult imillionaire living in Chicago. In January of 2001, in spit e of his belief that his case was growing stronger, he was told that it was being closed. In June, he wrot e an internal memo charging that the FBI , rat her than trying to prevent a terrorist attack, \"was merely gat hering intelligence so they would know who to arrest when a terrorist attack occurred. \" > 40 In May of 2002, Wright announced jhat he was suing the FBI for ref using to allow him to publish a book he had writ ten about the affair. Included in his descript ion of the act ions of his superiors in curt ailing his invest igat ions were words such as \"prevent ed, \" \"thwart ed, \" \"obst ruct ed, \" \"threat ened, \" \"int imidat ed, \" and \"ret aliat ion. \" > 41 In a later interview, report ing that he had been told that his case was being closed because it was \"bet ter to let sleeping dogs lie, \" he said: \"Those dogs weren't sleeping, they were training, they were get ting ready. ... Sept ember the 11 th is a direct result of the incompet ence of the FBI 's Internat ional Terrorism Unit .\" Chicago federal prosecut or Mark Flessner, who also worked on the case, evident ly thought that somet hing other than incompet ence was involved, saying that there \"were powers bigger than I was in the Just ice Depart ment and wit hin the FBI that simply were not going to let [the building of a criminal case] happen. \" > 42 Blocki ng the FBI in New York On August 28, 2001, the FBI office in New York, believing Khalid Almihdhar—who would later be named as one of the hijackers—had been involved in the bombing of the USS Cole, tried to convince FBI headquart ers to open a criminal invest igat ion. But the New York request was turned down on the grounds that Almilidhar could not be tied to the Cole invest igat ion wit hout the inclusion of sensit ive intelligence informat ion. One New York agent expressed his frust rat ion in an e-mail letter, saying, \"What ever has happened to this—someday someone will die—and. ..the public will not underst and why we were not more effect ive. ...

Edmonds soon informed her superiors that Dickerson had previously worked for a part icular foreign organizat ion, which was being invest igat ed by the FBI , and that Dickerson was mist ranslat ing, or even not translat ing at all, sensit ive informat ion regarding this organizat ion. Edmonds informed her superiors, furt hermore, that Dickerson had threat ened her for ref using to work as a spy for this organizat ion. But , Edmonds report ed, the FBI failed to respond to her complaint s, which she had made more than once, so in March she wrot e a letter to the Inspect or General of the Depart ment of Just ice, soon after which she was fired.

In Oct ober, at FBI Direct or Mueller's request , Attorney General Ashcrof t, appealing to the privilege of state secret s \"to prot ect the foreign policy and nat ional securit y interest s of the Unit ed States, \" asked a judge to throw out Edmonds' lawsuit . > 44 Crit ics wonder, of course, why the nat ional securit y of the Unit ed States would be prot ect ed by ignoring a claim that a spy for a foreign organizat ion being invest igat ed by the FBI was sabot aging that"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"invest igat ion. Schi ppers and FBI Agents Versus the US Government On Sept ember 13, 2001, Attorney David Schippers—who was the Chief Invest igat ive Counsel for the US House of Represent atives' Judiciary Commit tee in 1998 and its chief prosecut or for the impeachment of President Clint on in 1999—publicly stated that he had attempt ed to warn Attorney General Ashcrof t about attacks planned for \"lower Manhat tan\" six weeks bef orehand, based on informat ion he had received from FBI agent s. In this and subsequent statement s, Schippers said that the dat es and target s of the attacks as well as the names and funding sources of the hijackers were known by these agent s mont hs in advance. Schippers claimed furt her that the FBI curt ailed these invest igat ions, then threat ened the agent s wit h prosecut ion if they went public wit h their informat ion. At that time, Schippers furt her stated, the agent s asked him to try to use his influence to get the government to take act ion to prevent the attacks. Having failed in that effort , Schippers agreed to represent some of the agent s in a suit against the federal government , during which, if subpoenaed, they would be able to tell their story wit hout fear of prosecut ion. > 45 Because of this suit , Schippers—like the public interest law firm Judicial Wat ch, which joined forces wit h him on this case—is not a disint erest ed wit ness. But Schippers' allegat ions have been corroborat ed, Ahmed point s out , in a story by William Norman Grigg in a conservat ive rnagazine, The New American. Gngg, having interviewed three FBI agent s report ed that they had conf irmed \"that the informat ion provided to Schippers was widely known wit hin the Bureau bef ore Sept ember 11t h.\" One of them report edly said that some of the FBI field agent s—who were some of the \"most experienced guys\"—\"predict ed, almost precisely, what happened on Sept ember 11 th.\" He also said that it was widely known \"all over the Bureau, how these [warnings] were ignored by Washingt on. \" > 46 These report s make even more puzzling how the Joint Inquiry could have concluded, as ment ioned in the previous chapt er, that none of the informat ion available to the intelligence communit y \"ident ified the time place, and specif ic nat ure of the attacks that were planned for Sept ember 11, 2001. \" It seems that at least one US intelligence agency had this kind of very specif ic advance knowledge. Visa and Watch List Violati ons Immediat ely after 9/11, a number of irregularit ies regarding the alleged hijackers became known. It was learned, for example, that Mohamed Atta, considered the ringleader, was allowed back in the Unit ed States three times in 2001, in spit e of the fact that he had let his visa expire in 2000, had violat ed his visa by taking flying lessons, was known to have terrorist connect ions, and was under FBI surveillance. It was report ed, furt hermore, that evident ly over 50 people were involved in planning 9/11. These fact s led to this crit icism in a review by Accuracy in Media (AI M): Yet the conspirat ors proceeded unmolest ed. What is striking is how saf e these people apparent ly felt, how unt hreat ened by law enf orcement .... They left and ent ered the count ry unimpeded. Some were report edly on the so-called \"wat ch list \".... Yet this apparent ly caused them no problems. > 47 The crit ics suspect , of course, that somet hing other than incompet ence might account for this pat tern. The Questi on of the True Identi ty of the Hijackers Alt hough this issue does not , strict ly speaking, belong in this chapt er, I should explain why I have been qualif ying \"hijackers\" wit h the adject ive \"alleged. \" One of the unanswered quest ions about 9/11 is whet her the hijackings were really carried out by any of the men later named. Short ly after the attacks, stories appeared in newspapers suggest ing that at least five of the men ident ified by the FBI as 9/11 hijackers were still alive, and these stories were support ed by report s of \"st olen ident ities. \" > 48 The Saudiembassy in Washingt on, report s Meyssan, said that Abdulaziz al-Omari (supposedly the pilot of Flight 11, which crashed into the Nort h Tower of the WTC), Mohand al- Shehri, Salem al-Hazmi, and Saeed al-Bhamdi were all alive and living in Saudi Arabia. Meyssan also says that a fifth alleged hijacker, Waleed M. al-Shehri, \"gave an interview to the Arab - language daily, Al-Quds al-Arabi, based in London. \" > 49 One report even said that \"invest igat ors are studying the possibilit y that the ent ire suicide squad consist ed of impost ors. \" > 50 FBI Direct or Mueller, however, later claimed: \"We at this point def init ely know the 19 hijackers who were responsible. \" > 51 \"Yet many of the names and phot os are known to be wrong, \" says Thompson. \"Perhaps embarrassing fact s would come out if we knew their real names. \" > 52 Anot her report that creat es suspicion regarding the official story, according to which the hijackers were \"fundament alist \" Muslims, is that bet ween May and August of 2001, several of the alleged hijackers, including Mohamed Atta, report edly made at least six visit s to Las Vegas, during which"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"they drank alcohol, gambled, and frequent ed strip clubs, where they had lap dances perf ormed for them. > 53 Is this somet hing that true believers would do short ly bef ore going on a suicide mission to meet their maker ? There are also grounds for suspicion that evidence was plant ed to connect some of the alleged hijackers to the flight s. On 9/11, for example, aut horit ies found two of Attas bags, which failed to get loaded ont o Flight 11. These bags cont ained various items, including flight simulat ion manuals for Boeing airplanes, a copy of the Koran, a religious casset te tape, a not e to other hijackers about ment al preparat ion, and Attas will, passport , and internat ional drivers license. A report er for the New Yorker later wrot e: many of the invest igat ors believe that some of the init ial clues that were uncovered about the terrorist s' ident ities and preparat ions, such as flight manuals, were meant to be found. A former high -level intelligence official told me, \"What ever trail was left was left deliberat ely—f or the FBI to chase. \" As Thompson asks, why would Atta have planned to bring his will \"ont o a plane he knew would be dest royed ?\" > 54 Also suspicious was the discovery, a few blocks from the WTC on the day after 9/11, of the passport of alleged hijacker Sat am al-Suqami. > 55 One newspaper— ref lect ing the fact that it was widely but mist akenly report ed that the passport belonged to Atta—said \"the idea that Atta's passport had escaped from that inferno unsinged [strains] credulit y.\" > 56 These stories suggest that the trut h about what happened on 9/11 may be even furt her from the official account than suggest ed by the evidence I have cited prior to this sect ion. Meyssan, for example, proposes that \"the FBI invent ed a list of hijackers from which it drew an ident ikit port rait of the enemies of the West .\" > 57 I will, however, not pursue this quest ion furt her. ============= This chapt er obviously provides addit ional evidence against any posit ion weaker than the third possible view, because it suggest s that at least one US agency—t he FBI —had specif ic advance knowledge of the plot and took deliberat e steps to prevent this plot from being uncovered. Tyrone Powers, a former FBI special agent , is quot ed by Ahmed as saying that wit hin the intelligence communit y, \"on occasion, [damaging] act s are allowed if in the minds of the decision makers, they will lead to 'great er good. '\" One of the FBI agent s interviewed by Grigg for The New American said: \"There's got to be more to this than we can see. ... Obviously, people had to know. ... Its terrible to think this, but this must have been allowed to happen as part of some other agenda. \" > 58 The crit ics of the official account have some suggest ions as to what this agenda might have been.

CHAPTER SEVEN DID US OFFI CIALS HAVE REASONS FOR ALLOWI NG 9/11 ? The wars waged by the US government in Afghanist an and Iraq have been port rayed as part of its \"war on terrorism. \" These wars have been, in other words, just ified as responses to the terrorist attacks of 9/11. However, say crit ics of the official account , these wars were act ually on the agenda of the Bush administ rat ion long bef ore the attacks. Furt hermore, they claim, these wars were part of an even larger agenda. Pre -9/ 11 Plans to Attack Afghani stan Wit h regard to Afghanist an, Ahmed, drawing on various sources, > 1 calls it a mat ter of public record that \"corresponding wit h the growing shif t in US policy against the Taliban, a milit ary invasion of Afghanist an was planned long bef ore 11 th Sept ember. \" > 2 Ahmed and Thompson bot h suggest that at least one of the fundament al purposes behind this plan was to facilit ate a huge project of a consort ium of oil companies known as Cent Gas (Cent ral Asia Gas Pipeline). This consort ium, which includes Delt a Oil of Saudi Arabia, was formed by Unocal, one of the oil giant s of the Unit ed States, to build pipelines through Afghanist an and Pakist an for transport ing oil and gas from Turkmenist an to the Indian Ocean. In Sept ember of 2000, a year bef ore 9/11, an Energy Informat ion Fact Sheet , published by the US government , said: Afghanist an's signif icance from an energy standpoint stems from its geographic posit ion as a pot ent ial transit rout e for oil and nat ural gas export s from Cent ral Asia to the Arabian Sea. This pot ent ial includes proposed mult ibillion dollar oil and gas export pipelines through Afghanist an. > 3 At one time, Unocal and Washingt on had hoped that thcTaliban would provide suf ficient stabilit y for their project to move forward, but they had lost this hope."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"Providing some background, Ahmed and Thompson explain that the Taliban was originally creat ed by the CIA, working in conjunct ion wit h Pakist an's ISI (Inter-Services Intelligence), wit h addit ional financial support from Saudi Arabia. > 4 According to Ahmed Rashid's well -known book Taliban, the pipeline project was cent ral to this support : Impressed by the rut hlessness and willingness of the then -emerging Taliban to cut a pipeline deal, the State Depart ment and Pakist an's Inter-Services Intelligence agency agreed to funnel arms and funding to the Taliban. > 5 When the Taliban, wit h this financial support from Saudi Arabia and the CIA funneled through the ISI, conquered Kabul in 1996, Unocal was hopef ul that it would provide enough stabilit y to allow its pipelines to be built and prot ect ed. Indeed, it was report ed, \"preliminary agreement [on the pipeline project ] was reached bet ween the [Taliban and Unocal] long bef ore the fall of Kabul. \" > 6 Unocal even report edly provided some of the financial support for the Taliban. > 7 The fact that the Taliban cont inued to serve the purposes of the ISI is illust rat ed, Thompson point s out , by the fact that when Taliban troops were about to conquer the major city in nort hern Afghanist an in 1998, an ISI officer sent a message saying: \"My boys and I are riding into Mazar -i- Sharif .\" > 8 In any case, after the Taliban conquered this city, it had cont rol of most of Afghanist an, including the ent ire pipeline rout e. Cent Gas then announced that it was \"ready to proceed. \" > 9 Lat er that year, however, Unocal, having become dubious about the Talibans abilit y to provide suf ficient stabilit y, pulled out of Cent Gas. From then on, says Ahmed, \"the US grew progressively more host ile toward the Taliban, and began exploring other possibilit ies to secure its regional supremacy, while maint aining basic ties wit h the regime, to negot iate a non -milit ary solut ion. \" > 10 The final attempt to find a non -milit ary solut ion report edly occurred at a four -day meet ing in Berlin in July of 2001. The Bush administ rat ion tried to get the Taliban to share power, thereby creat ing a joint government of \"nat ional unit y.\" According to the Pakist ani represent ative at the meet ing, Niaz Naik, one of the Americans said \"eit her the Taliban behave as they ought to...or we will use anot her opt ion. .a milit ary operat ion\" Anot her American report edly told the Taliban: \"Eit her you accept our offer of a carpet of gold, or we bury you under a carpet of boobs. \" > 11 Alt hough one of the Americans later denied that such a threat was made, one of them conf irmed it, saying: \"I think there was some discussion of the fact that the Unit ed States was so disgust ed wit h the Taliban that they might be considering some milit ary act ion. \" > 12 According to a BBC report , furt hermore, Naik said that he was told by senior American officials that \"milit ary - act ion against Afghanist an would go ahead by the middle of Oct ober\"—t hat it would take place \"bef ore the snows start ed falling in Afghanist an, by the middle of Oct ober at the latest .\" > 13 Thompson, not ing that the Unit ed States start ed bombing Afghanist an on Oct ober 7, asks: \"Is it coincidence that the attacks begin exact ly when the US said they would, mont hs bef ore 9/11 ?\" > 14 The supposit ion that it was not simply a coincidence is support ed by an account from a former member of the Sout h Carolina Nat ional Guard, who later declared: My unit report ed for drill in July 2001 and we were suddenly and unexpect edly informed that all act ivit ies planned for the next two mont hs would be suspended in order to prepare for a mobilizat ion exercise to be held on Sept . 14, 2001. We worked diligent ly for two weekends and even came in on an unscheduled day in August to prepare for the exercise. By the end of August all we needed was a phone call, which we were to expect , and we could hop into a fully prepared convoy wit h our bags and equipment packed. > 15 If this report is true, it suggest s that it was known in July that the attacks would occur short ly bef ore Sept ember 14. In any case, Niaz Naik also did not think that mere coincidence was involved. The BBC report quot ed him as saying that he \"was in no doubt that after the World Trade Cent er bombings, this pre -exist ing US plan had been built upon and would be implement ed wit hin two or three weeks. \" Naik also said it was doubt ful that Washingt on would drop its plan even if bin Laden were to be surrendered immediat ely by the Taliban, because \"the wider object ive was to topple the Taleban [sic] regime and inst all a transit ional government .\" > 16 Ahmed and Thompson find this assessment of the wider object ive, along wit h the view that included facilit ating the pipeline project , to be conf irmed by subsequent event s, such as the fact comment ed upon in the following statement by a writ er in an Israeli newspaper: If one looks at the map of the big American bases creat ed, one is struck by the fact that they are complet ely ident ical to the rout e of the project ed oil pipeline to the Indian Ocean. ... If I were a believer in conspiracy theory, I would think that bin Laden is an American agent . > 17 Thompson and Ahmed also point out that bot h the new Afghani prime minist er, Hamid Karzai, and President Bush's special envoy to Afghanist an, Zalamy Khalilzad, were previously on Unocals"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"payroll. These appoint ment s, Ahmed adds, \"illust rat e the fundament al interest s behind US milit ary intervent ion in Afghanist an. \" > 18 As early as Oct ober 10, Ahmed furt her not es, the US Depart ment of State had informed the Pakist ani Minist er of Oil that \"in view of recent geopolit ical development s,\" Unocal was ready to go ahead wit h the pipeline project . > 19 In light of this background, Ahmed concludes that 9/11 was more the \"trigger\" than the reason for the US war in Afghanist an. > 20 Pre -9/ 11 Plans to Attack Iraq In a statement in early March of 2002, President Bush, after saying that he was not very concerned about Osama bin Laden, added: \"I am deeply concerned about Iraq. \" > 21 Thompson and Ahmed believe that this was not a recent concern, that the war against Iraq, like the war against Afghanist an, had already been planned by US officials prior to 9/11. Part of the evidence for this claim is found in the document Rebuilding America's Def enses: Strat egy, Forces, and Resources for a New Cent ury, which I brief ly ment ioned in the Introduct ion. This document was published in Sept ember of 2000 by the Project for the New American Cent ury (PNAC), a neo -conservat ive think tank that was formed by many people who went on to become insiders in the Bush admnist rat ion, including Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsf eld, Paul Wolf owit z (Rumsf eld's deput y at the Def ense Depart ment ), and Lewis \"Scoot er\" Libby (Cheney's Chief of Staff) > 22 Wit h regard to the quest ion of whet her the 2003 war against Iraq was really mot ivat ed by the perceived need to eliminat e Saddam, as these men would then claim, the following passage in Rebuilding America's Def enses (quot ed by Thomspon) is relevant : The Unit ed States has for decades sought to play a more permanent role in Gulf regional securit y. While the unresolved conf lict wit h Iraq provides the immediat e just ificat ion, the need for a subst ant ial American force presence in the Gulf transcends the issue of the regime of Saddam Hussein. > 23 The main thing, in other words, was get ting a \"subst ant ial American force presence in the Gulf ,\" wit h Saddam providing the \"immediat e just ificat ion. \" Edward Herman also point s to the import ance of this document for assessing the sincerit y of the public rat ionale given for the war: \"Key members of the Bush administ rat ion, \" point s out Herman, \"had announced an aim of 'toppling Saddam Hussein back in 2000 in the publicat ion of the Project for the New American Cent ury. \" > 24 This group made an even earlier statement of this aim in a letter to President Clint on in January of 1998, urging him to adopt a strat egy aimed at \"the removal of Saddam Hussein's regime from power. \" This letter, signed by Donald Rumsf eld, Paul Wolf owit z, and Richard Perle, among others, urged Clint on \"to take the necessary steps, including milit ary steps, to prot ect our vital interest s in the Gulf ,\" adding that \"American policy cannot cont inue to be crippled by a misguided insist ence on unanimit y in the UN Securit y Council. \" > 25 In support ing the cont ent ion that 9/11 was more a pret ext than a reason for the attack on Iraq, Thompson quot es a report that Secret ary of Def ense Rumsf eld, only a few hours after the Pent agon had been struck, wrot e a memo saying that he want ed the \"best info fast . Judge whet her good enough hit S.H. [Saddam Hussein] at same time. Not only UBL [Usama bin Laden] . Go massive. Sweep it all up. Things relat ed and not .\" > 26 Thompsons cont ent ion is given addit ional support by John Pilger, who cites Bob Woodwards report that the next day at the meet ing of the Nat ional Securit y Council, Rumsf eld said that Saddams Iraq should be target ed in the first round of the war on terrorism. > 27 Crit ics can, furt hermore, point to bot h act ions and statement s during and after the war that support their cont ent ion that the war had much more to do wit h oil and regional cont rol than it did wit h the announced purposes for the war. Whereas the Bush and Blair administ rat ions claimed that the war was to remove weapons of mass dest ruct ion, through which Saddam Hussein posed a threat to his neighbors and even the Unit ed Kingdom and the Unit ed States, the intelligence behind this assessment has been widely report ed to have been dist ort ed, even invent ed. Sir Jonat han Porrit t, head of the Sust ainable Development Commission, which advises Blair's government on ecological issues, publicly stated that the prospect of winning access to Iraqi oil was \"a very large fact or\" in the allies' decision to attack Iraq in March, adding: \"I don't think the war would have happened if Iraq didn't have the second -largest oil reserves in the world. \" Paul O'Neill, Bush's former Treasury Secret ary, has said that the Bush administ rat ion had from the out set planned to attack Iraq, in large part for its oil. > 28 The fact that oil was of preeminent import ance was demonst rat ed Stephen Gowans says, by the fact that the top item on the Pent agon's agenda, once it gave the order for jackboot s to begin marching on Baghdad, was to secure the oil fields in sout hern Iraq. And when chaos broke out in Baghdad, US forces let gangs of loot ers and arsonist s run"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"riot through \"the Minist ry of Planning, the Minist ry of Educat ion, the Minist ry of Irrigat ion, the Minist ry of Trade, the Minist ry of Indust ry, the Minist ry of Foreign Affairs, the Minist ry of Cult ure and the Minist ry of Informat ion. \" ...But at the Minist ry of Oil, where archives and files relat ed to all the oil wealt h Washingt on has been itching to get its hands on, all was calm, for ringing the Minist ry was a phalanx of tanks and armoured personnel carriers. > 29 The suspicion that Iraq was not attacked primarily for the publicly stated reasons is also suggest ed by the evidence that the Bush administ rat ion planned to use its post -9/ 11 \"war on terrorism\" as a pret ext for attacks on still other count ries. A report in Newsweek for example, said that prior to the attack on Iraq, some of Bush's advisors advocat ed also attacking Saudi Arabia, Iran, Nort h Korea, Syria, and Egypt . One senior Brit ish official was quot ed as saving: \"Everyone want s to go to Baghdad. Real men want to go to Tehran. \" > 30 One of those \"real men\" was Richard Perle, a founding member of PNAC, who has been quot ed as describing America's \"war on terrorism\" in these words: This is total war. We are fight ing a variet y of enemies. There are lots of them out there. All this talk about first we are going to do Afghanist an, then we will do Iraq. ... [T]his is ent irely the wrong way to go about it. If we just let our vision of the world go fort h, and. ...just wage a total war. ..our children will sing great songs about us years from now. > 31 This kind of vision could give fanat icism a bad name. It is now increasingly recognized that insof ar as the Unit ed States is waging a war on terrorism, \"terrorism\" is being def ined in a very select ive, self -serving way. \"For Bush, \" Meyssan says, \"terrorism seems to be def ined as any form of violent opposit ion to American leadership. \" > 32 Richard Falk likewise saw that it soon became clear that the \"war on terrorism was being waged against all non -st ate revolut ionary forces perceived as host ile to American global interest s.\" What is really going on, in other words, is \"an empire -building project undert aken behind the smokescreen of the war on global terror. \" > 33 Phyllis Bennis agrees, saying that \"the war [on terrorism] was never about bringing anyone to just ice; it was about conquest and the mushrooming of US global power, all in the name of right eous vengeance. \" > 34 Chossudovsky, Mahajan, and count less other crit ics have made the same point . In any case, it is now widely agreed that the Bush administ rat ion (as well as Blair's government ) lied about the reasons for attacking Iraq. Is it not time to expand this quest ion to whet her it also lied about the event itself , 9/11, that was used as the primary just ificat ion for the wars against Afghanist an and Iraq and the even larger agenda of the Bush administ rat ion ? A New Pearl Harbor Woul d Hel p Wit h regard to this larger agenda, bot h Ahmed and Thompson ref er to the 1997 book by former Nat ional Securit y Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski, The Grand Chessboard: American Primacy and its Geost rat egic Imperat ives. Besides port raying the Eurasian landmass as the key to world power, Brzezinski port rayed Cent ral Asia, wit h its vast oil reserves, as the key to the dominat ion of Eurasia. Having summarized this argument , Ahmed and Thompson point to Brzezinskis statement that ensuring cont inued \"American primacy\" by get ting cont rol of this region will require \"a consensus on foreign policy issues\" wit hin the American public Get ting such consensus, however, will be difficult , because \"America is too democrat ic at home to be aut ocrat ic abroad, \" a fact that \"limit s the use of America's power, especially its capacit y for milit ary intimidat ion. \" Cont inuing his analysis of the def ect s in the American charact er, Brzezinski explained that \"the pursuit of power is not a goal that commands popular passion, except in condit ions of a sudden threat or challenge to the public's sense of domest ic well being. \" > 35 Theref ore, he counseled, the needed consensus on foreign policy issues will be difficult to obt ain \"except in the circumst ance of a truly massive and widely perceived direct ext ernal threat .\" > 36 Ahmed connect s this passage to an earlier one, in which Brzezinski said that the American public, which is ambivalent about \"the ext ernal project ion of American power, \" had \"support ed America's engagement in World War II largely because of the shock effect of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. \" > 37 Ahmed's point is that if those two passages are read toget her, the kind of \"widely perceived direct ext ernal threat \" said to be needed would be Pearl Harbor type of event . Brzezinski's book, aut hored by a former nat ional securit y advisor, cannot be considered simply one book among hundreds offering advice to the government . Alt hough Brzezinski advised a Democrat ic president (Jimmy Cart er), he is a hard liner who has report edly been highly regarded by the Bush administ rat ion. It is perhaps not merely coincident al, theref ore, that three years after Brzezinskis apparent wish for a Pearl -Harbor -type event was published, the aforement ioned publicat ion of the Project for the New American Cent ury would cont ain a similar passage. Alt hough this passage has previously"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"been cited, it is import ant to emphasize that it comes in the cont ext of a call for the complet ion of the \"revolut ion in milit ary affairs, \" through which a Pax Americana, or \"American Peace, \" can be more efficient ly est ablished. Unf ort unat ely, according to this document 's aut hors, the needed transf ormat ion would probably come about slowly \"absent some cat ast rophic and cat alyzing event —like a new Pearl Harbor. \" > 38 If a new Pearl Harbor were to occur, in other words, this complet ion of the revolut ion in milit ary affairs could be brought about more quickly, because the massive funding needed could be obt ained. It was in response to this predict ion that John Pilger made the assert ion, quot ed in the Introduct ion, that \"[t]he attacks of 11 Sept ember 2001 provided the 'new Pearl Harbor. '\" > 39 What kind of changes did these advocat es of American dominance out line, and has the New Pearl Harbor helped bring them about ? Mi ssi le Defense and a Space Pearl Harbor It is import ant to realize that the cent erpiece of the \"revolut ion in milit ary affairs\" is a program to weaponize and hence dominat e space. This program will require much of the massive increase in funding for \"def ense\" for which Brzezinski and the Project for the New American Cent ury have called. The purpose of this program is spelled out quit e explicit ly in a document called \"Vision for 2020, \" which begins wit h this mission statement : \"US Space Command—dominat ing the space dimension of milit ary operat ions to prot ect US interest s and invest ment .\" > 40 Its primary purpose, in other words, is not to prot ect the American homeland, but to prot ect American invest ment s abroad. It makes this point even more explicit by comparing the import ance of the Space Command today wit h the fact that in previous times \"nat ions built navies to prot ect and enhance their commercial interest s.\" It is to dominat e space to prot ect the commercial interest s of America's elit e class that , according to current project ions, over $1 trillion will be required from American taxpayers. > 41 The \"Vision for 2020\" document engages in no sent iment al propaganda about the need for the Unit ed States to dominat e space for the sake of promot ing democracy or otherwise serving humanit y. Rat her, it says candidly, if indiscreet ly: \"The globalizat ion of the world economy. ..will cont inue wit h a widening bet ween 'haves' and 'have -not s.'\" In other words, as America's dominat ion of the world economy increases, the poor will get still poorer while the rich get still richer, and this will make the \"have -not s\" hat e America all the more, so we need to be able to keep them in line. We can do this through what the advocat es of this program originally called \"Global Bat tlespace Dominance. \" Because some people found this term too explicit , the pref erred term today is \"Full Spect rum Dominance\" (which provided the tide for a previously quot ed book by Rahul Mahajan). This term means not only being dominant on land, on the sea, and in the air, as the US milit ary is already, but also having cont rol of space. Discussing this \"American project of global dominat ion associat ed wit h the weaponizat ion of space, \" Richard Falk says: \"The empire - building quest for such awesome power is an unprecedent ed exhibit ion of geopolit ical greed at its worst , and needs to be exposed and abandoned bef ore it is too late.\" > 42 The only part of this program that has received much public discussion is the def ensive aspect of it, which in the Reagan Administ rat ion was called the Strat egic Def ensive Initiative and is today called the Missile Def ense Shield. Alt hough these names suggest that America's goal in space is purely def ensive, this so-called shield is only one part of a three -part program. One of the other part s is put ting surveillance technology in space, wit h the goal of being able to zero on any part of the planet wit h such precision that every enemy of US forces can be ident ified. This part is already well on the way to realizat ion. > 43 The third part of the prograrn - which shows that the informal name for this program, \"St ar Wars, \" is more accurat e than its technical name - is put ting act ual weapons in space, including laser cannons. These lasercannons have the offensive pot ent ial, as one writ er put it, to \"make a cruise missile look like a firecracker. \" > 44 Wit h lazer weapons on our sat ellit es, the Unit ed States will be able to dest roy the milit ary sat ellit es any adversarial count ry would try to send up, and this is, indeed, part of the announced intent ion: \"to deny others the use of space. \" The US Space Command could thereby maint ain total and permanent dominance. The aggressive purpose of the US Space Command's program is announced in the logo of one of its divisions: \"In Your Face from Out er Space. \" > 45 It is not only in this document that such aggressive aims are frankly stated. As Mahajan point s out , the Project for the New American Cent ury's document makes the following \"remarkable admission\": In the post -Cold -War era, America and its allies. ..have become the primary object s of det errence and it is states like Iraq, Iran and Nort h Korea who most wish to develop det errent capabilit ies. Project ing convent ional milit ary forces—will be far more complex and const rained when the American homeland. ..is subject to attack by otherwise weak rogue regimes capable of cobbling toget her a minuscule ballist ic missile force. Building an effect ive. ..syst em of missile def enses is a prerequisit e for maint aining American preeminence. > 46 In other words, although the name \"missile def ense shield\" suggest s that the syst em is designed to shield America from attacks, its real purpose is to prevent other nat ions from det erring America"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"from attacking them. This statement furt her suggest s that Iran, Iraq, and Nort h Korea were later det ermined by President Bush to deserve the title \"axis of evil\" because of their perverse wish to develop the capacit y to det er the Unit ed States from project ing milit ary force against them. The Project 's descript ion of the US milit ary's role in these offensive terms is fully in accord wit h the Bush administ rat ions Nat ional Securit y Strat egy, published in 2002, which, besides embodying most of the recommendat ions of Rebuilding America's Def enses, says that \"our best def ense is a good offense. \" > 47 The most import ant new component of this offense is to be the \"full spect rum dominance\" afforded by complement ing America's land, air, and sea forces wit h a full-fledged Space Force. Short ly bef ore becoming Secret ary of Def ense in January of 2001, Ronald Rumsf eld complet ed his work as chairman of the Commission to Assess US Nat ional Securit y Space Management and Organizat ion. This \"Rumsf eld Commission, \" as it was informally known, published its report in the second week of January. > 48 The aim of its proposals, it said, was to \"increase the asymmet ry bet ween US forces and those of other milit ary powers. \" Besides advocat ing the terminat ion of the 1972 ABM Treat y (which the Bush administ rat ion act ed on prompt ly), this report recommended subst ant ial changes, including the subordinat ion of all the other armed forces and the intelligence agencies to the Space Force. Recognizing that such a drast ic reorganizat ion of the armed forces and intelligence agencies would normally evoke great resist ance, the report added: Hist ory is replet e wit h inst ances in which warning signs were ignored and change resist ed unt il an ext ernal, \"improbable\" event forced resist ant bureaucracies to take act ion. The quest ion is whet her the US will be wise enough to act responsibly and soon enough to reduce US space vulnerabilit y. Or whet her, as in the past , a disabling attack against the count ry and its people—a \"Space Pearl Harbor\"—will be the only event able to galvanize the nat ion and cause the US Government to act . > 49 We have, accordingly, yet anot her suggest ion by a cent ral figure in the Bush administ rat ion that anot her \"Pearl Harbor\" may be necessary to \"galvanize the nat ion. \" This report was released on January 11, 2001, exact ly nine mont hs bef ore the US suf fered attacks from the air that our def enses appeared to be helpless to prevent . And the primary response evoked by these attacks was a sense of America's vulnerabilit y. The chairman of the commission that issued the above report was, furt hermore, well placed to take advant age of those attacks and the result ing sense of \"US space vulnerabilit y.\" As Meyssan point s out , at a press conf erence that began at 6:42 PM on 9/11 itself , Rurnsf eld, now Secret ary of Def ense, used the attacks to browbeat Democrat ic Senat or Carl Levin, who was then chair of the Senat e Armed Services Commit tee (during the brief period of the Bush administ rat ion during which Democrat s had cont rol of the Senat e). Bef ore live camera, Rumsf eld said: Senat or Levin, you and other Democrat s in Congress, have voicedf ear that you simply don't have enough money for the large increase in def ense that the Pent agon is seeking, especially for missile def ense, and you fear that you'll have to dip into the Social Securit y funds to pay for it. Does this sort of thing convince you that an emergency exist s in this count ry to increase def ense spending, to dip into Social Securit y, if necessary, to pay for def ense spending --increase def ense spending ? > 50 It does appear that the attacks of 9/11 provided Rumsf eld wit h what he thought could pass for \"a Space Pearl Harbor, \" and he seemed remarkably prepared to take advant age of it. Furt hermore, if US officials were involved in facilit ating the attacks of 9/11 Rumsf eld was not the only one wit h great interest in the Space Command. Its other primary advocat e was its current commander, General Ralph E. Eberhart , who in his role as commander of NORAD was in charge of air traf fic cont rol on 9/11. \" Also, General Richard Myers, who was in the process of becoming the new chairman of the Joint Chief s of Staff and was the Act ing Chairman on 9/11, had previously been head of the US Space Command. Known by some as \"General Starwars, \" he was in charge during the writ ing of \"Vision for 2020, \" wit h its quit e explicit expression of the intent to get absolut e cont rol of space so that the Pent agon can prot ect American commercial interest s while they are increasing the gap bet ween the \"haves\" and the \"have -not s\" of the world. Accordingly, the three men who have been most ident ified wit h advocacy of the US Space Force are also the three figures who would have been most direct ly involved in promulgat ing and overseeing a \"st and down\" order on 9/11, if such was given. ============ The evidence summarized in this chapt er shows that officials of the Pent agon and the Bush administ rat ion would have had many reasons— from their plans for Afghanist an and Iraq to their desire for massive funding to weaponize space—f or allowing, if not planning, the attacks of 911. Some of this evidence point s to the trut h of at least the sevent h possible view—t hat the"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"Whit e House had specif ic knowledge of the attacks in advance, knowing that they would occur, for example in time to launch a war against Afghanist an bef ore the wint er snows start ed. Some of the evidence even suggest s the eight h view, according to which the Whit e House was involved in the planning. It is possible of course, that although cent ral figures of the Bush administ rat ion evident ly desired \"a new Pearl Harbor, \" they did not plan the attacks but simply learned that they had been planned by others, so that all they had to do was to make sure that the attacks were not prevent ed. Yet wit h all that was apparent ly riding on the occurrence of a new Pearl Harbor, reasonable people could conclude that the Whit e House would not have left this occurrence to chance. A Precedent: Operati on Northwoods All the informat ion summarized so far arguably present s strong evidence point ing to US complicit y in the attacks of 9/11 involving US intelligence agencies, the Pent agon, and the Whit e House. But regardless of how strong this evidence may be considered, many and perhaps most Americans will resist the idea that this \"at tack on America\" could have been an inside job, staged by America's own leaders. The primary responsibilit y of the president and vice president , their cabinet , US intelligence agencies, and US milit ary leaders is to prot ect America and its citizens. Even if the official account of 9/11 leaves dozens of unanswered quest ions, the true account cannot , many Americans will assume, be that American polit ical and milit ary leaders colluded to allow, much less stage, the attacks of 9/11 - Regardless of the benef its that may have been foreseen if a \"new Pearl Harbor\" were to occur; our milit ary and polit ical leaders would not have part icipat ed in a plan to bring about such an event . We feel that we know a priori that all conspiracy theories of this type are false, because American milit ary and polit ical leaders simply would not do such a thing. In 1962, however, a plan was formulat ed that provides a part ial precedent , a plan about which we now know because of recent ly declassif ied document s. The background to this plan was President Eisenhower's request to the CIA, near the end of his administ rat ion, to come up wit h a pret ext to invade Cuba. The CIA formulat ed \"A Program of Covert Operat ions Against the Cast ro Regime, \" the goal of which was \"the replacement of the Cast ro regime wit h one more devot ed to the true interest s of the Cuban people and more accept able to the US, in such a manner to avoid any appearance of US intervent ion. \" > 52 Eisenhower had approved this plan. But after the next president , John Kennedy, accept ed a CIA plan that led to the Bay of Pigs fiasco, he had responsibilit y for Cuba taken away from the CIA and assigned it to the Depart ment of Def ense Early in 1962, the Chairman of the Joint Chief s of Staff, General Lyman Lemnit zer brought Kennedy a plan called Operat ion Nort hwoods. > 53 According to the covering \"Memorandum for the Secret ary of Def ense, \" signed by all the Joint Chief s, this plan, marked Top Secret described \"pret ext s which would provide just ificat ion for US milit ary intervent ion in Cuba. \" > 54 According to the \"Memorandum for Chief of Operat ions, Cuba Project ,\" a decision to intervene \"will result from a period of height ened US -Cuban tensions which place the Unit ed States in the posit ion of suf fering just ifiable grievances. \" It was import ant , the memorandum said, \"to camouf lage the ultimat e object ive. \" Part of the idea was to influence world opinion in general and the Unit ed Nat ions in part icular \"by developing the image of the Cuban government as rash and irresponsible, and as an alarming and unpredict able threat to the peace of the West ern Hemisphere. \" > 55 The plan then list ed a series of possible act ions to creat e this image. For example: \"We could develop a Communist Cuban terror campaign in the Miami area, in other Florida cities and even in Washingt on. ..We could sink a boat load of Cubans enrout e to Florida (real or simulat ed). \" > 56 Part icularly interest ing, in light of some of the proposed scenarios as to \"what really happened\" on 9/11 (see Ch. 1, n. 32), is the following idea: It is possible to creat e an incident which will demonst rat e convincingly that a Cuban aircraf t has attacked and shot down a chart ered civil airliner. ... The dest inat ion would be chosen only to cause the flight plan rout e to cross Cuba. The passengers could be a group of college student s off on a holiday. ... a. An aircraf t at Eglin AFB would be paint ed and numbered as an exact duplicat ion for a civil regist ered aircraf t belonging to a CIA propriet ary organizat ion in the Miami area. At a designat ed time the duplicat ion would be subst ituted for the act ual civil aircraf t and would be loaded wit h the select ed passengers, all boarded under caref ully prepared aliases. The act ual regist ered aircraf t would be convert ed to a drone. b. Take off times of the drone aircraf t and the act ual aircraf t will be scheduled to allow a rendezvous sout h of Florida. From the rendezvous point the passenger - carrying aircraf t will descend to minimum altitude and go direct ly into an auxiliary field at Eglin AFB where arrangement s will have been made to evacuat e the"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"passengers and ret urn the aircraf t to its original status. The drone aircraf t meanwhile will cont inue to fly the filed flight plan. When over Cuba the drone will being [sic] transmit ting on the internat ional dist ress frequency a \"MAY DAY\" message stating he is under attack by Cuban MI G aircraf t. The transmission will be interrupt ed by dest ruct ion of the aircraf t which will be triggered by radio signal. > 57 In this and some of the other plans, although casualt y list s would be placed in US newspapers to \"cause a wave of nat ional indignat ion, \" > 58 the subt erf uge would not act ually result in the loss of life. But this was not true of all of the plans, such as the plan to \"sink a boat load of Cubans. \" At least one plan, furt hermore, would have taken the lives of Americans. According to this idea, called a \"Remember the Maine\" incident : \"We could blow up a US ship in Guant anamo Bay and blame Cuba. \" > 59 Kennedy reject ed this plan, even though it was endorsed by all the joint chief s. Those who say that , although milit ary leaders might formulat e such plans, an American president would never agree to such a despicable plan can point to this reject ion as evidence. However, different president s, in different circumst ances, make different decisions. For example, in the early 1890 s, a plan to annex Hawaii was reject ed by President Grover Cleveland, whose secret ary of state considered the plan \"a self ish and dishonourable scheme of a lot of advent urers. \" But this scheme was accept ed by the next president , William McKinley > 60 (who was also the one who used the Maine incident to just ify ent ering the war against Spain in order to take cont rol of Cuba, Puert o Rico, and the Philippines). Accordingly, the fact that Kennedy turned down that part icular plan at that part icular time—short ly after the Bay of Pigs embarrassment —does not necessarily mean that all American president s in all circumst ances would turn down plans to achieve geopolit ical goals through \"incident s\" involving the taking of innocent lives, even innocent American lives. > 61 =============== The evidence in this chapt er, in any case, provides furt her support for the conclusion of Michel Chossudovsky, only part ially quot ed earlier, that the post -9/ 11 American war \"is not a campaign against internat ional terrorism. It is a war of conquest ... [a] nd the American people have been consciously and deliberat ely deceived by their government .\" > 62 The next chapt er will provide one more kind of evidence present ed by the crit ics for this conclusion.

For example, according to many resident s of Kabul, a convoy of al-Qaeda forces, thought to include its top leaders, made a remarkable escape during one night in early November of 2001. A local businessman said: We don't underst and how they weren't all killed the night bef ore because they came in a convoy of at least 1,000 cars and trucks. It was a very dark night , but it must have been easy for the American pilot s to see the headlight s. The main road was jammed from eight in the evening unt il three in the morning. Thompson comment s: \"Wit h all of the sat ellit e imagery and intense focus on the Kabul area at the time, how could such a force have escaped the city unobserved by the US ?\" > 1 Also early in November, US intelligence agencies, having wat ched al-Qaeda fight ers and leaders move into the area of Jalalabad, report ed that bin Laden himself had arrived. According to Knight - Ridder newspapers, this is what happened next : American intelligence analyst s concluded that bin Laden and his recreat ing fight ers were preparing to flee across the border. But the US Cent ral Command, which was running the war, made no move to block their escape. \"It was obvious from at least early November that this area was to be the base for an exodus into Pakist an, \" said one intelligence official, who spoke only on condit ion of anonymit y. \"All of this was known, and frankly we were amazed that not hing was done to prepare for it.\" > 2 Short ly thereaf ter, on November 14, the Nort hern Alliance capt ured Jalalabad. That night , a convoy of \"several hundred cars\" holding 1,000 or more al-Qaeda and Taliban fight ers, evident ly including bin Laden, escaped from Jalalabad and reached the fort ress of Tora Bora. US forces bombed the nearby Jalalabad airport , but apparent ly not the convoy. > 3 On November 16, approximat ely 600 al-Qaeda and Taliban fight ers, including many senior leaders, report edly escaped from Afghanist an, by taking a long trek to escape the bombing in the Tora Bora region. Alt hough there are two main rout es from the Tora Bora region to Pakist an, US planes bombed only one of these rout es, so that the 600 men were able to escape unharmed by using the other one. Hundreds more report edly cont inued to use this escape rout e over the next weeks, generally not bot hered by US bombing or Pakist ani border guards. > 4 One Afghan intelligence officer report edly said that he was ast ounded that the Americans did not station troops to block the most obvious exit rout es. The Telegraph later said: \"In ret rospect , and wit h the benef it of dozens of account s from the part icipant s, the bat tle for Tora Bora looks more like a grand charade. \" Eyewit nesses expressed shock, it said, that US forces pinned in Taliban and al- Qaeda forces, thought to cont ain many high leaders, on three sides only, leaving the rout e to Pakist an open. An intelligence chief in Afghanist an's new government was quot ed as saying: \"The border wit h Pakist an was the key, but no one paid any attent ion to it.\" > 5 A Special Forces soldier stationed in Fayet teville, Nort h Carolinalat er stated that on November 28, US forces had bin Laden pinned in a Tora Bora cave but failed to act . While Special Forces soldiers were wait ing for orders, he said, they wat ched two helicopt ers fly into the area where bin Laden was believed to be, load up passengers, and fly toward Pakist an. This statement , made on condit ion of anonymit y, is given more credibilit y, Thompson point s out , by the fact that Newsweek separat ely report ed that many Tora Bora locals claimed that \"myst erious black helicopt ers swept in, flying low over the mount ains at night , and scooped up al-Qaeda's top leaders. \" > 6 \"Perhaps just coincident ally, \" Thompson adds, the same day that this story was report ed there was also a story report ing that five soldiers at Fayet teville—at least three of whom were Special Forces soldiers who had recent ly ret urned from Afghanist an—and their wives had died since June in apparent murder -suicides. > 7 In late December of 2001, the new Afghan interior minist er, Younis Qanooni, claimed that the ISI had helped bin Laden escape from Afghanist an. > 8 For crit ics of the official account , this claim is signif icant given the fact that the Bush administ rat ion has considered Pakist an a part ner in its post -9/ 11 effort s."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"In March of 2002, this apparent lack of interest in killing or capt uring bin Laden was put into words by the president himself , who said of bin Laden: \"He's a person who's now been marginalized. ..! just don't spend that much time on him. ..I truly am not that concerned about him. \" The suspicion that the war was never about bin Laden, which Bush's statement could be taken to imply, was explicit ly stated, Thompson point s out , a mont h later by General Richard Myers, who said that \"the goal has never been to get bin Laden. \" > 9 Anot her American official was quot ed as making an even more revealing statement , saying that \"cast ing our object ives too narrowly\" risked \"a premat ure collapse of the internat ional effort if by some lucky chance Mr. bin Laden was capt ured. \" > 10 A way of making sense of all this was provided by George Monbiot , who wrot e a week after 9/11: If Osama bin Laden did not exist , it would be necessary to invent him. For the past four years, his name has been invoked whenever a US president has sought to increase the def ence budget or wriggle out of arms cont rol treat ies. He has been used to just ify even President Bush's missile def ence programme. ... Now he has become the personif icat ion of evil required to launch a crusade for good: the face behind the faceless terror. ... [H]is usef ulness to west ern government s lies in his power to terrif y. When billions of pounds of milit ary spending are at stake, rogue states and terrorist warlords become asset s precisely because they are liabilit ies. > 11 Monbiot s statement , in conjunct ion wit h the American officicial's concern about a \"premat ure collapse of the internat ional effort ,\" provides apossible explanat ion as to why the \"hunt for bin Laden\" was unsuccessf ul. Conceal ing the Rol e of Paki stan's ISI As we saw earlier, the CIA and its count erpart in Pakist an, the ISI, worked toget her in the late 1990s to creat e the Taliban and ensure its vict ory. This point is reinf orced by Chossudovsky, who says: \"Wit hout US support channeled through the Pakist ani ISI, the Taliban would not have been able to form a government in 1996. \" > 12 Furt hermore, he says, just as wit hout the ISI there would have been no Taliban government in Kabul, \"wit hout the unbending support of the US government , there would be no powerf ul milit ary -int elligence apparat us in Pakist an. \" > 13 This close relat ionship bet ween the CIA and the ISI goes back to the 1980 s, during which the ISI was the local agency through which the CIA conduct ed its covert operat ion in Afghanist an, which began in 1979. The CIA and the ISI recruit ed radical Muslims from around the world to form the Mujaheddin to fight against Soviet forces. > 14 Osama bin Laden was originally brought to Pakist an to help wit h this effort . Alt hough he was under cont ract to the CIA, \"the CIA gave Usama free rein in Afghanist an, as did Pakist an's intelligence generals\"—Ahmed quot es John Cooley as saying—and bin Laden used that free rein and his accumulat ed wealt h to begin organizing al-Qaeda in 1985. > 15 In the late 1980 s, Pakist an's President Benazir Bhut to, seeing how strong the Mujaheddin movement was becoming, told President Bush: \"You are creat ing a Frankenst ein. \" > 16 Then in the late 1990 s, after the CIA had worked wit h the ISI to creat e the Taliban, Sout h East Asia specialist Selig Harrison who knew CIA agent s, report s that he warned them that they \"were creat ing a monst er. \" > 17 And if bot h al-Qaeda and the Taliban were report edly becoming monst rous, the same was said of the ISI itself . After the wit hdrawal of the Soviet Union from Afghanist an, the ISI, which had at the inst igat ion of the CIA begun producing heroin in order to turn Soviet soldiers into addict s, began smuggling its heroin into West ern count ries, using the huge prof its to build itself up. As a result , said one analyst , the ISI became a \"parallel struct ure wielding enormous power over all aspect s of government .\" Time magazine later conf irmed this analysis, saying that the \"not orious\" ISI \"is commonly branded 'a state wit hin the state,' or Pakist an's 'invisible government ,'\" and a story in the New Yorker called the ISI \"a parallel government of its own. \" > 18 This hist ory of the ISI, wit h its links to the CIA on the one hand and al-Qaeda and the Taliban on the other, is import ant in light of evidence that these links were never broken. Chossodovsky, reject ing the view that the \"Osama -CI A links belong to the 'bygone era' of the Soviet -Af ghan war, \" assert s: \"The CIA has never severed its ties to the 'Islamic Milit ant Net work. '\" > 19 And Ahmed quot es Selig Harrison's statement , made in March of 2001, that \"[t]he CIA still has close links wit h the ISI.\" > 20 These links are also support ed by an invest igat or wit h a very different polit ical perspect ive from Ahmed's and Chossudovky's, Gerald Posner. I cited earlier Posners report on the interrogat ion of Abu Zubaydah insof ar as it dealt wit h Zubaydah's claim that his al-Qaeda act ivit ies were carried out on behalf of Saudi officials. Zubaydah also report edly said that it was on behalf of Pakist ani officials. \"According to Zubaydah, \" report s Posner, he was present in 1996, in Pakist an, when bin Laden struck a deal wit h Mushaf Ali Mir, a highly placed milit ary officer wit h close ties to some of the most pro -Islamist dement s in ISI. It was a relat ionship that was still act ive and provided bin Laden"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"and al-Qaeda prot ect ion, arms, and supplies. > 21 Posner also report s that , just as three of the Saudis ident ified by Zubaydah died wit hin four mont hs, the same fate bef ell Musf aaf Ali Mir seven mont hs later. On February 20, 2003, he, his wif e, and many of his closest conf idant s were killed when their air force plane—which had recent ly passed inspect ion—went down in good weat her. > 22 Accordingly, although Posner accept s the official American posit ion on most issues, he here present s evidence against the US attempt to dist ance the Pakist anis, port rayed as good, from bin Laden and al-Qieda, port rayed as evil. In any case, the import ance of the fact that the ISI cont inued to be closely linked wit h bot h the CIA and al-Qaeda may have been made manif est by a discovery coming short ly after 9/11 - This was the disovery that an ISI agent , Saeed Sheikh, had made a wire transf er of $100. 000 to Mohamed Atta's bank account s in Florida, and that he had done this at the inst ruct ion of none other than General Mahrnoud Ahmad, the Direct or of the ISI. > 23 Accordingly, the ISI, which had cont inued to work closely wit h the CIA, was discovered to have secret ly sent money to the man considered to be the ringleader of the 9/11 terrorist s. This \"damning link, \" as Agence France - Press called it, was report edly first revealed to the US government by the Indian government . > 24 The discovery of this transf er took on even more pot ent ial signif icance when it was learned that General Mahmoud Ahmad had been in Washingt on on 9/11—having, in fact , been there from Sept ember 4 unt il several days after 9/11. During this period, he report edly met wit h CIA Direct or George Tenet unt il Sept ember 9, then met wit h officials in the Pent agon, the Nat ional Securit y Council, and the State Depart ment , as well as wit h the chairmen of the House and Senat e Intelligence commit tees. The News, a leading newspaper in Pakist an, made this signif icant comment on Sept ember 10: \"What added interest to [General Ahmad's] visit is the hist ory of such visit s. Last time [his] predecessor was [in Washingt on] , the domest ic [Pakist ani] polit ics turned topsy -turvy wit hin days. \" The ref erence, Thompson point s out , is to the coup of Oct ober 12, 1999, when General Musharraf took over the government —af ter which he made General Ahmad, who had been inst rument al to the success of the coup, the Direct or of the ISI. > 25 Big things also happened on the occasion of this visit , and not only the attacks of 9/11 itself . On Sept ember 9, the leader of the Nort hern Alliance, Ahmad Masood, was the vict im of an assassinat ion, which the Nort hern Alliance declared to be the work of the ISI. That this assassinat ion followed immediat ely upon ext ended conversat ions bet ween the head of the ISI and the head of the CIA is especially signif icant , suggest s Chossudovsky, in light of the fact that the Unit ed States had long been seeking to \"weaken Masood, who was perceived as a nat ionalist ref ormer. \" Suggest ing that this assassinat ion \"served US interest s,\" Chossudovsky adds that after Masood was dead, \"the Nort hern Alliance became fragment ed into different fact ions. Had Masood not been assassinat ed, he would have become the head of the post -Taliban government formed in the wake of the US bombings of Afghanist an. \" > 26 These ref lect ions provide a possible explanat ion of the treat ment of Julie Sirrs by the Def ense Intelligence Agency, discussed in Chapt er 6 . The signif icance of Masoods assassinat ion was perhaps alluded to by John O'Neill, the invest igat or who had resigned from the FBI after having his attempt s to invest igat e al-Qaeda obst ruct ed. On Sept ember 10, the day after Masood's assassinat ion, O'Neill moved into his new office in the Nort h Tower of the WTC, where he had become direct or of securit y, and on 9/11 he was one of the people killed. On the night of Sept ember 10, he had report edly told a colleague: \"We're due for somet hing big. I don't like the way things are lining up in Afghanist an. \" > 27 From the perspect ive of the crit ics of the official account of 9/11, the fact that Masood was assassinat ed while the ISI chief was visit ing Washingt on might have been one of the reasons Washingt on tried to keep this visit quiet . In any case, a comparison of transcript s of Condoleezza Rice's press conf erence on May 16, 2002, suggest s, believes Chossudovsky, that the Bush administ rat ion did want to keep General Ahmads presence in Washingt on from being widely known. The transcript from the Federal News Service shows that the following interchange occurred: QUESTI ON: Are you aware of the report s at the time that the ISI chief was in Washingt on on Sept ember 11 th, and on Sept ember 10 th, $100, 000 was wired from Pakist an to these groups in this area ? And why he was here ? Was he meet ing wit h you or anybody in the administ rat ion ? MS. RICE: I have not seen that report , and he was cert ainly not meet ing wit h me. Besides the quest ion whet her it is credible that the head of Pakist an's intelligence agency would meet wit h the Nat ional Securit y Council but not wit h the president 's Nat ional Securit y Advisor, the other suspicious thing is that , as point ed out by Chossudovsky, the Whit e House version of this transcript begins thus:"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"QUESTI ON: Dr. Rice, are you aware of the report s at the time that (inaudible) was in Washingt on on Sept ember 11 th...? This version of the transcript , which—unlike the transcript from the Federal News Service—does not cont ain the informat ion that the person being discussed was \"the ISI chief ,\" was the one report ed on the CNN show \"Inside Polit ics\" later that day. > 28 The suspicion that US officials want ed to conceal the ISI connect ion is also suggest ed by the evidence, raised by Chossudovsky, that the FBI , in report ing on the connect ion wit h Pakist an, did not specif ically ment ion General Ahmad, Saeed Sheikh, or the ISI. For example, Brian Ross of ABC News report ed that he had been told by federal aut horit ies that they had \"tracked more than $100, 000 from banks in Pakist an. \" Ross also report ed that according to Time magazine, \"some of that money ... can be traced direct ly to people connect ed to Osama bin Laden. \" > 29 The FBI 's way of report ing the story, saying that the money came from \"people connect ed to Osama bin Laden, \" divert ed attent ion from General Ahmad, Saeed Sheikh, and the ISI. Indeed, thus laundered, the pot ent ially embarrassing discovery about the transf er of money was used to conf irm the official account —t hat primary responsibilit y for the attacks belonged to Osama bin Laden. Lat er evidence suggest ed that Saeed Sheikh had transf erred even more money to Atta. Thompson says that evident ly $100, 000 was transf erred in 2000 and anot her $100, 000 on August 11 of 2001, and that it is not clear to which of these transf ers the story that broke in Oct ober ref erred. > 30 Also, the New York Times suggest ed that a total of about $325, 000 was transf erred to Atta's Florida account s by one \"Must afa Ahmed, \" and this name was thought by some, including the Guardian and CNN, to be an alias for Saeed Sheikh. > 31 This individual's final transf ers to Atta's account occurred on Sept ember 8 and 9. > 32 \"These last -minut e transf ers, \" Thompson report s, \"are tout ed as the 'smoking gun' proving al-Qaeda involvement in the 9/11 attacks, since Saeed is a known financial manager for bin Laden. \" However, Thompson asks, \"since Saeed also works for the ISI, aren't these transf ers equally a smoking gun of ISI involvement in the 9/11 attacks ?\" > 33 Chossudovsky takes this thought a step furt her, calling the story of the ISI's transf er of money to Atta, in conjunct ion wit h the presence of the ISI chief in Washingt on during the week, \"the missing link behind 9-11. \" According to his summary statement : The 9-11 terrorist s did not act on their own volit ion. The suicide hijackers were inst rument s in a caref ully planned intelligence operat ion. The evidence conf irms that al-Qaeda is support ed by Pakist an's ISI [and it is amply document ed that ] the ISI owes its exist ence to the CIA. > 34 Chossudowski, accordingly, believes that this evidence suggest s possible complicit y by \"key individuals wit hin the US milit ary -int elligence Est ablishment ,\" adding: \"Whet her this amount s to complicit y on the part of the Bush administ rat ion remains to be firmly est ablished. The least one can expect at this stage is an inquiry. \" > 35 Chossudowsky is not alone in his musings on the possibilit y that the money transf er might point to direct US involvement in the planning of 9/11. Ahmed and Jared Israel bot h ask whet her the long - time connect ion bet ween the CIA and the ISI might mean that US financial aid was funneled to al-Qaeda through the ISI. > 36 This possibilit y is also suggest ed by a story in the Pit tsburgh Tribune -Review, which said: \"There are many in Musharraf 's government who believe that Saeed Sheikh's power comes not from the ISI, but from his connect ions wit h our own CIA. The theory is that ...Saeed Sheikh was bought and paid for. \" > 37 Ahmed, realizing that the suggest ion of CIA financing is speculat ive, believes that what happened next at least demonst rat ed that Washingt on did not want the cont inuing relat ionship bet ween al- Qaeda and the ISI explored. On Oct ober 8, just bef ore the beginning of the bombing campaign in Afghanist an, General Ahmad gave up his posit ion wit h the ISI. Alt hough it was publicly announced that he had decided it was time to ret ire, a story in the Times of India said: \"the trut h is more shocking. \" This more shocking trut h was that after India had given US officials evidence of the money transf er ordered by General Ahmad, he had been quiet ly dismissed after \"US aut horit ies sought his removal. \" > 38 For Ahmed, this behavior suggest s a cover -up: The US, which one would think would be spearheading a full-scale invest igat ion into the role of the ISI, act ually prevent ed one from going ahead by asking from behind the scenes for the ISI chief ...to quiet ly resign. ... By pressuring the then ISI Direct or-General to resign wit hout scandal on the pret ext of reshuf fling, while avoiding any publicit y wit h respect to his siphoning of funds to alleged lead hijacker Mohamed Area, the US had effect ively blocked any sort of invest igat ion into the mat ter. It prevent ed wide publicit y of these fact s, and allowed the ISI chief , who was clearly complicit in the terrorist attacks of 11 th"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"Sept ember, to walk away free. What ever the mot ivat ions behind such a cynical policy, it is indisput able that the US response at least suggest s a signif icant degree of indirect complicit y on the part of the US government , which appears more interest ed in prot ect ing, rat her than invest igat ing and prosecut ing, a milit ary intelligence agency that funded the lead hijacker in the WTC and Pent agon attacks. > 39 Chossudovsky likewise finds it dist urbing that \"the Bush administ rat ion ref uses to invest igat e these ISI links. \" > 40 Anot her possible connect ion bet ween the ISI and 9/11 is Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, ident ified by the US government as the mast ermind of the 9/11 attacks (as well as one of the planners of Project Bojinka, the 1993 bombing of the WTC, and the bombing of the USS Cole). In 1999, according to report s, he repeat edly visit ed Atta's apart ment in Hamburg. > 41 As we saw earlier, the day bef ore 9/11 he evident ly gave Atta final approval during a telephone call intercept ed by the NSA. All this is generally known (wit h the proviso that , according to the NSA, it did not translat e the cont ent of that call unt il after 9/11). What has rarely been ment ioned, however, is evidence that Mohammed, a Pakist ani, had links to the ISI. One of the few except ions to this silence was Josef Bodansky, the direct or of the Congressional Task Force on Terrorism and Unconvent ional Warf are, who stated in 2002 that Mohammed was relat ed to the ISI, which had act ed to shield him. > 42 If this is correct , then the day bef ore 9/11, Mohamed Atta was given money by one ISI agent (Saeed Sheikh) and final aut horizat ion by anot her ISI agent (Khalid Shaikh Mohammed). We will see below, furt hermore, that there is evidence that Saeed and Mohammed worked closely toget her on anot her ISI -relat ed operat ion. Further Evi dence that the ISI Shoul d Be Investi gated Crit ics of the official account of 9/11 report that in addit ion to the fact that US officials evidendy tried to cover up the connect ion bet ween die ISI and the al-Qaeda operat ives in the Unit ed States, there have been still other stories about the ISI suggest ing that any real attempt to underst and 9/11 would need to focus on it. Some of these stories have involved invest igat ive report ers. In November of 2001, Christ ina Lamb was in Pakist an invest igat ing the connect ions bet ween the ISI and the Taliban, but the ISI had her arrest ed and expelled from the count ry. > 43 In late January of 2002, Wall Street Journal report er Daniel Pearl was kidnapped while in Pakiscan invest igat ing, according to a story in the Washingt on Post \"links bet ween Pakist ani ext remist s and Richard C. Reid, the Brit ish man accused of trying to blow up an American airliner wit h explosives hidden in his sneakers. \" Pearl, who had read a story in the Bost on Globe suggest ing that Reid may have had ties to a religious group called Al-Fuqra, was evident ly going to see its leader, Ali Gilani, when he was kidnapped. Gilani report edly had links wit h Saeed Sheikh and the ISI. The story in the Washingt on Post cont inued: \"As part of that probe, Pearl may have soured into areas involving Pakist an's secret intelligence organisat ions, \" > 44 The US press suspect ed early on, theref ore, that the ISI was responsible for Pearl's fate. That the kidnappers were not just ordinary terrorist s was suggest ed by their demands, especially their demand that the Unit ed States sell F-16 fight ers to Pakist an. As Thompson comment s: \"No terrorist group had ever shown interest in the F-16's, but this demand and the others ref lect the desires of Pakist an's milit ary and the ISI.\" > 45 It was report ed by UPI at me end of January, in fact , that US intelligence believed the kidnappers to be connect ed to the ISI. > 46 After this, stories about Pearl would only seldom ment ion the ISI. After it was learned that Pearl had been murdered, it was also learned that Saeed, the ISI agent who had wired $100, 000 to Mohamed Atta, had been involved in the kidnapping. The ISI picked him up and held him secret ly for a week, after which neit her Saeed nor the ISI would discuss what had transpired that week. The Pakist ani police then attribut ed Pearl's murder to him. Saeed at first conf essed, but , after he was sent enced to hang, he recant ed. Thompson asks: \"Did Saeed work out a secret deal during his 'missing week' in ISI cust ody to get a light sent ence, a deal that is later broken ?\" > 47 In any case, bet ween Saeeds arrest and his convict ion, Thompson report s, some news stories ment ioned his links to al-Qaeda, some ment ioned his links to ISI, and a few ment ioned that he might have been relat ed to bot h groups, but many stories failed to ment ion either connect ion. By the time of Saeed's convict ion in July of 2002, moreover, \"not a single US newspaper is connect ing Saeed to either al-Qaeda or the ISI.\" Thompson asks: \"Is the media afraid of report ing any news that could imply a connect ion bet ween the ISI and the 9/11 attacks ? \" > 48 The same quest ion could be asked, furt hermore, wit h regard to the report ing about Khalid Shaikh Mohammed's involvement in the Pearl case. In 1997, former CIA agent Robert Baer was told by a former police chief in Qat ar—t o which Mohammed had fled after the exposure of the Bojinka plot in the Philippines—t hat Mohammed was one of bin Laden's key aides. > 49 Baer then told Pearl"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"about Mohammed, so Pearl may have been looking into the connect ion bet ween Reid and Mohammed. Invest igat ors later came to believe, in any case, that Reid operat ed under Mohammed's supervision. > 50 They also came to believe that Mohammed was the mast ermind behind the kidnapping. > 51 Furt hermore, Josef Bodansky, the man who claimed in 2002 that Mohammed had ties to the ISI, also claimed then that Mohammed was the one who ordered Pearl's murder, > 52 and in Oct ober of 2003, report er John Lupkin said that US officials \"now have new informat ion that leads them to believe [Mohammed] killed Pearl. \" > 53 In this story, however, there is no ment ion of a possible ISI connect ion. Pearl is said to have been working on \"a story on Islamic milit ant s.\" And the only organizat ion to which Mohammed is connect ed is al-Qaeda. In any case, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, thought to be the mast ermind behind 9/11, is also thought to be behind the kidnapping and murder of Daniel Pearl. If that is so, it would not be a big leap to infer that Pearl may have been killed out of fear that he was uncovering the trut h about 9/11. And if Mohammed was indeed connect ed wit h ISI, this would be furt her reason to suspect ISI involvement in 9/11. Yet anot her story involving the ISI and report ers began when Pakist an's government failed in February of 2002 to prevent the News from publishing a story about Saeed's connect ions to the ISI. Saeed had not only admit ted his involvement in attacks on the Indian parliament , the story revealed, but had also said that the ISI had helped him finance, plan, and execut e the attacks. Short ly thereaf ter, the ISI pressured the News to fire the four journalist s who worked on the story and also demanded an apology from the newspaper's edit or. The journalist s were fired and the edit or fled the count ry. > 54 After summarizing these report s, Thompson adds: \"This informat ion comes from an art icle tided, 'There's Much More To Daniel Pearl's Murder Than Meet s the Eye, ' and that cert ainly seems to be the case. \" > 55 The fact that the ISI apparent ly has so much to hide, combined wit h the fact that an American journalist was report edly kidnapped and perhaps murdered by the same ISI agent who had sent money to Mohamed Atta, should, one would think, make US intelligence agencies very anxious to interview Saeed to learn all they could about the ISI. The Washingt on Post , for example, said: \"The [ISI] is a house of horrors wait ing to break open. Saeed has tales to tell. \" > 56 However, in late February of 2002, Time magazine stated that the second highest Taliban official in US cust ody, Mullah Haji Abdul Samat Khaksar, had after several mont hs still been wait ing to talk to the CIA, even though he had report edly volunt eered the informat ion that \"ISI agent s are still mixed up wit h the Taliban and al-Qaeda. \" Many mont hs later, the Indian Express was wondering why Saeed, sitting in a Pakist ani prison, still had not been interviewed by US intelligence agencies. > 57 This lack of curiosit y suggest s to crit ics of the official account that US intelligence agencies assumed that these men had not hing to tell them that they did not already know. Far from pursuing the ISI connect ions, in fact , Washingt on seemed intent on denying that there were any. In March of 2002, Secret ary of State Powell declared that there were no links bet ween Pearl's murder and \"element s of the ISI.\" In light of the overwhelming evidence that the main suspect , Saeed Sheikh, worked for the ISI, said the Guardian, Powell's denial was \"shocking. \" > 58 Short ly thereaf ter, when Attorney General Ashcrof t announced a criminal indict ment against Saeed, there was no ment ion of his financing of the 9/11 attacks. > 59 These incident s suggest ing an official desire to cover up ISI involvement , furt hermore, report edly had a start ling precedent in 1999. According to later report s, an informant for the US government , Randy Glass, made a wire -recording of a conversat ion at a dinner involving himself , some illegal arms dealers, and an ISI agent named Rajaa Gulum Abbas. This dinner, which took place on July 14, 1999, and was observed by FBI agent s at nearby tables pret ending to be cust omers, was at a rest aurant wit hin view of the WTC. Abbas, besides saying that he want ed to buy a shipload of stolen US milit ary weapons to give to bin Laden, point ed to the WTC and said: \"Those towers are coming down. \" > 60 In June of 2002, Abbas was secredy indict ed for attempt ing to buy US milit ary weapons illegally. But when the indict ment was finally revealed in March of 2003, it made \"no ment ion of Pakist an, any ties to Afghanist an's former Taliban regime or the ultimat e dest inat ion of the weapons. \" > 61 If the part of this story about the towers is true, it suggest s, obviously, that the plan to attack the WTC was discussed long bef ore the Bush administ rat ion took office, and even bef ore Sept ember of 2000, when the Project for the New Amencan Cent ury published its manif est o wit h its ref erence to the good that could come out of a new Pearl Harbor. \" And if true, moreover, it makes the circumst ant ial case for ISI involvement in the planning for 9/11 even stronger, adding furt her interest to the fact that the Bush administ rat ion has been so intent to keep the ISI's nameout of all stories about 9/11. FBI Flight from Flight School Investi gati ons Furt her lack of curiosit y about the background to the attacks was shown by the FBI in relat ion to a story, which broke four days after 9/11, that many of the alleged hijackers had received flight training at US milit ary inst allat ions. These inst allat ions included the Naval Air Station in"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"Pensacola, Brooks Air Force Base in San Ant onio, Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama, and the Def ense Language Inst itute in Mont erey, Calif ornia. > 62 The Pensacola station was even list ed on the drivers licenses of three of the men as their permanent address. > 63 When asked about this report , a spokesperson for the US Air Force said that while the names were similar, \"we are probably not talking about the same people. \" > 64 TV producer, book aut hor, and invest igat ive journalist Daniel Hopsicker report s that when he asked a major in the Air Force's Public Affairs Office about this story, she said: \"Biographically, they're not the same people. Some of the ages are 20 years off.\" But when Hopsicker, replying that he was interest ed only in Mohamed Atta, asked if she was \"saying that the age of the Mohamed Atta who attended the Air Forces Internat ional Officer's School at Maxwell Air Force Base was different from the terrorist Atta's age as report ed, \" she replied: \"Urn, er, no. \" Then when Hopsicker said that he would like informat ion about the Mohamed Atta who had attended the school at Maxwell, so that he could cont act him, the major report edly said that she did not think he was going to get that informat ion. On Sept ember 16, news report s said that , wit h regard to Atta and two other men who had report edly attended US milit ary schools: \"Of ficials would not release ages, count ry of origin or any other specif ic det ails of the three individuals. \" > 65 Even US senat ors evident ly got stonewalled. When Florida's Senat or Bill Nelson learned that three of the hijackers had been trained at Pensacola Naval Station, he sent a letter to Attorney General Ashcrof t asking if this was true. Hopsicker report s that when a spokesman for Senat or Nelson was asked about this, he said: \"we never got a def init ive answer from the Just ice Depart ment . So we asked the FBI for an answer. .. Their response to dat e has been that they are trying to sort through somet hing complicat ed and difficult .\" Nevert heless, on Oct ober 10, wit h this \"complicat ed and difficult \" problem unsolved and dozens of other fact s seeming to scream out for an ext ensive and intensive invest igat ion, FBI Direct or Mueller, calling the FBI 's mont h-long invest igat ion of 9/11 \"the most exhaust ive in its hist ory, \" declared it over. Officials report edly said that Mueller's attitude was that his agent s now had \"a broad underst anding of the event s of Sept ember 11\" and that it \"was now time to move on. \" > 66 Mueller, according to the Washingt on Post , \"described report s that several of the hijackers had received flight training in the Unit ed States as news, quit e obviously. '\" But he had the agent s who were invest igat ing this news reassigned. > 67 \"The invest igat ive staff has to be made to underst and, \" one law enf orcement official was quot ed as saying, \"that we're not trying to solve a crime now. \" > 68 To crit ics of the official account , a cover -up is suggest ed not only by the FBI 's ref usal to invest igat e this story but also by evidence that it had earlier tried to conceal the training received by some of the hijackers at two flight schools in Venice, Florida. Hopsicker, report ing that many of the men had trained at these two schools, also report s that just 18 hours after the 9/11 attacks— at 2 AM—FBI agent s came to bot h schools and removed student files. > 69 This story, like the one about the FBI conf iscat ing the film from the gas station across from the Pent agon immediat ely after the crash there, lends addit ional support to the charge that the FBI had rat her specif ic advance knowledge. The FBI 's Qui ck Rel ease of Omar al-Bayoumi One fact about post -9/ 11 invest igat ions that the crit ics of the official account find signif icant is that whereas many people wit h no apparent connect ions to the hijackers were arrest ed and held for long periods, some people wit h seemingly obvious connect ions were, if arrest ed at all, quickly released. For example, report s Thompson, back in 1999, when Nawaf Alhazmi and Khalid Almihdhar—who would later be named as two of the hijackers—f irst ent ered the count ry, they were met at the airport in Los Angeles by a Saudi named Umar al-Bayoumi. He drove them to San Diego and provided an apart ment for them. He also helped them open a bank account , obt ain car insurance, get Social Securit y cards, and call flight schools in Florida. > 70 As the CongressionalJoint Inquiry would later learn, \"One of the FBI 's best sources in San Diego informed the bureau that he thought that al-Bayoumi, \" who seemed to have access to large sums of money, \"must be an intellignece officer for Saudi Arabia, \" > 71 Two mont hs bef ore 9/11, al- Bayoumi moved to England. After 9/11, he was arrest ed by Brit ish agent s working wit h the FBI . However, the FBI , ost ensibly accept ing his story that he had met Alhazmi and Almihdhar by coincidence, angered Brit ish agent s by releasing him \"af ter a week wit hout charge. \" Thompson comment s: \"Al -Bayoumis quick release is in sharp cont rast to that of hundreds of US Muslims who are held anonymously for many monris after 9/11 despit e having no connect ions to terrorism of any kind. \" > 72 A Cover -Up at the NSA ? In late Oct ober of 2001, the Bost on Globe report ed that some government intelligence officials were furious because, they said informat ion pert inent to the 9/11 invest igat ion was being dest royed by the Nat ional Securit y Agency (NSA). They also claimed that possible leads were not being followed because of lack of cooperat ion by the NSA. > 73 In a story that Thompson evident ly"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"thinks might be relat ed, invest igat ive report er James Bamf ord, an aut horit y on the NSA, report ed that at least six of the ident ified hijackers, including all of those that boarded Flight 77 from Washingt on, had from August unt il 9/11 been \"living, working, planning and developing all their act ivit ies in Laurel, Maryland, which happens to be the home of the NSA. So they were act ually living alongside NSA employees as they were plot ting all these things. \" > 74 This fact might be simply a coincidence, but the accusat ions of a cover -up by NSA officials could make one wonder. Later Devel opments Invol ving Moussaoui On July 2, 2002, mot ions from Zacarias Moussaoui were unsealed infederal court . Claiming to have informat ion showing the US goverment want ed the attacks of Sept ember to happen, Moussaoui indicat ed that hewant ed to test ify bef ore bot h a grand jury and Congress. > 75 Thus far what he has to say has not been made public. In Sept ember of 2002, invest igat ive report er Seymour Hersh revealed that federal prosecut ors had not discussed a plea bargain wit h Moussaoui since he had been indict ed the previous November. Report ing that Moussaoui's lawyers, and some FBI officials, remain bewildered at the government 's failure to pursue a plea bargain, \" Hersh quot ed a federal public def ender as saying: \"I've never been in a conspiracy case where the government wasn't interest ed in knowing if the def endant had any informat ion—t o see if there wasn't more to the conspiracy. \" > 76 On July of 2003, an Associat ed Press story cont ained the following statement s: Def ying a court order, the Just ice Depart ment said Monday it would not make an al-Qaeda wit ness available to terrorism suspect Zacarias Moussaoui—even though prosecut ors underst ood this could mean dismissal of the charges. The only US case to arise from the Sept ember 11 attacks could be sent to a milit ary tribunal if US Dist rict Judge Leonie Brinkema dismissed the case. ... The government said it recognizes that its object ion means the deposit ion of suspect ed Sept ember 11 organizer Ramzi Binalshibh cannot go forward. The Just ice Depart ment 's decision also \"obligat es the court now to dismiss the indict ment unless the court finds that the interest s of just ice can be served by anot her act ion, \" the prosecut ion filing said. ... Brinkema has ruled that Moussaoui, who is represent ing himself , should be allowed to quest ion Binalshibh via a sat ellit e hookup. The exchange, which the government is desperat ely trying to stop, could be played to jurors if Moussaoui's case goes to trial. .. Repeat ing earlier argument s, the government said Monday: \"The deposit ion, which would involve an admit ted and unrepent ant terrorist (the def endant ) quest ioning one of his al-Qaeda conf ederat es, would necessarily result in the unaut horized disclosure of classif ied informat ion. Such a scenario is unaccept able to the government , which not only carries the responsibilit y for prosecut ing the def endant , but also of prot ect ing this nat ions securit y at a time of war wit h an enemy who already murdered thousands of our citizens. \" > 77 From the point of view of crit ics of the official account of 9/11, these stories suggest that the Just ice Depart ment 's primary concern is not to find out what really happened, nor to prosecut e the man who has beenknown as \"the 20 th hijacker, \" but to keep him from speaking in public. Promoti ons Instead of Puni shment The two major theories to account for the failure to prevent the attacks of 9/11, as we have seen, are the complicit y theory and the incompet ence theory. As Barrie Zwicker point ed out , \"Incornpet ence usually earns reprimands, \" so the incompet ence theory is weakened in the eyes of crit ics by the absence of reprimands. Thompson report s for example, that over a year after 9/11, the direct ors of the CIA, the FBI , and the NSA all admit ted bef ore a congressional commit tee that no individuals in their agencies had been fired or even punished for misst eps connect ed to 9/11. > 78 To the cont rary, Thompson adds, some of them were promot ed. For example, Marion \"Spike\" Bowman—t he agent at FBI headquart ers who altered the Minneapolis FBI 's request for the warrant to search Moussaouis belongings—was in December of 2002 given an FBI award for \"except ional perf ormance. \" This award came, furt hermore, after a congressional report said that Bowman's RFU unit had given Minneapolis FBI agent s \"inexcusably conf used and inaccurat e informat ion\" that was \"pat ent ly false. \" > 79 Ref lect ing on this and other promot ions, a former Just ice Depart ment official said that FBI Direct or Mueller had \"promot ed the exact same people who have presided over the—f ailure. \" > 80"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"Such act ions, of course, give crit ics support for their cont ent ion that from the point of the FBI and the Bush administ rat ion more generally, the event s of 9/11 represent ed not a failure but a spect acular success. ========== For the crit ics of the official account , the evidence summarized in this chapt er, which concerns official US behavior after 9/11, furt herst rengt hens the case for concluding not only that the official account is false but also that the true account would point to US complicit y. For one thing, the evidence that American forces did not really try to capt ure Osama bin Laden suggest s that his long -term relat ionship wit h US agencies had not really, as the official account says, come to an end. As to exact ly which US inst itutions were involved in the conspiracy, evidence in this chapt er, more than that in previous ones, suggest s CIA involvement . This chapt er also provides furt her evidence of complicit y by the Whit e House, at least in the attempt to cover up the ISI's—and thereby the CIA's—involvement . Wit h regard to Whit e House involvement in the planning: If the predict ion about the WTC towers made by an ISI agent in 1999 really occurred and ref lect ed a joint ISI -CI A plan, then that plan must have been formulat ed long bef ore it was cert ain that George W. Bush would become president . If he was involved in the planning, he would most likely have been brought in after the basic plan had already been formulat ed.

Called \"Worldwide Attack Mat rix, \" Tenet s plan, Bob Woodward has report ed, \"described covert operat ions in 80 count ries that were either underway or that he was now recommending. \" At a meet ing at Camp David four days after 9/11, Tenet received aut horizat ion. > 3 Short ly afterwards, point s out Meyssan, \"the agency's funding was increased by 42 percent to successf ully carry out the 'Worldwide Attack Mat rix. '\" > 4 Wit h regard to the Pent agon and the weapons indust ry: The president , having assert ed that US milit ary capacit y would be increased suf ficient ly to win this new war \"what ever it cost s,\" was able to push through the biggest increase for milit ary spending since the end of the Cold War. Wit hout 9/11, such an increase would have been highly unlikely. As Phyllis Bennis point s out : \"The $48 billion addit ion to the Pent agon budget request ed by the Bush administ rat ion in January 2002 by itself was more money than any other count ry spent on its milit ary. \" > 5 In a calmer atmosphere, in other words, Congress might have decided that we were already spending more than enough. The attacks of 9/11 allowed, in part icular, great ly increased funding for the Space Force, championed by Donald Rumsf eld, General Eberhart , and General Myers. For these men, new support for the \"missile def ense syst em\" may have been the most import ant benef it to come out of 9/11. Whereas in July of 2001, a Gallup Poll showed that only 53 percent of the populat ion support ed this syst em, a poll released on Oct ober 21 showed that support had jumped to 70 percent . > 6 Wit h regard to benef its to the Bush administ rat ion as such, Ahmed reminds us that prior to 9/11 it was widely perceived to be in a crisis. Many Americans believed Bush to have gained the presidency fraudulent ly; there was a growing economic crisis, bot h domest ic and globally; \"the Bush administ rat ion was becoming increasingly isolat ed due to its foreign policies. ..and was consequent ly failing to push through resolut ions via the Unit ed Nat ions Securit y Council and other internat ional bodies\"; there were massive \"ant i-globalizat ion\" demonst rat ions; \"Bush approval rat ings—bot h personal and polit ical -were plummet ing, \" so it was probably going to be \"ext remely difficult for the Bush administ rat ion to maint ain its already uncomf ort ably slim majorit y in the House for the midt erm elect ions in 2002; and \"the strat egic and milit ary planning out lined in Brzezinski's [The Great Chessboard] would have been impossible to implement at this time. However, \"handed the public mood of shock and revulsion over the shocking tragedy of 11 th Sept ember, the Bush administ rat ion was able to exploit these sent iment s to advance long - standing global economic and strat egic aims\" and \"to avert the crisis of legit imacy it had previously faced. \" > 8 Wit h regard to implement ing its strat egic and milit ary plans, the Bush administ rat ion and its advisors seemed well prepared to use this attack by non -st ate terrorist s as a basis for going to war against states on its attack list . In his address to the nat ion on the evening of 9/11, President Bush said: \"We will make no dist inct ion bet ween the terrorist s who commit ted these act s and those who harbor them. \" Then, as ment ioned in the Introduct ion, as soon as the president s address was complet ed, Henry Kissinger had an opinion piece ready to publish on the Internet . In that piece, he in effect support ed Bush's \"no dist inct ion\" point , saying: The government should be charged wit h a syst emat ic response that , one hopes, will end the way that the attack on Pearl Harbor ended— wit h the dest ruct ion of the syst em that is responsible for it. That syst em is a net work of terrorist organizat ions shelt ered in capit als of cert ain count ries. ... [A]ny government that shelt ers groups capable of this kind of attack, whet her or not they can be shown to have been involved in this attack, must pay an exorbit ant price. > 9"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"A week later, Richard Perle made the same point in an edit orial ent itled \"St ate Sponsors of Terrorism Should Be Wiped Out Too, \" in which he said: Those count ries that harbour terrorist s—t hat provide the means wit h which they would dest roy innocent civilians—must themselves be dest royed. The war against terrorism is about the war against those regimes. > 10 It does appear that the administ rat ion and its advisors were ready to hit the ground running wit h this message. And it worked. After the president announced his intent ion to \"rally the world\" in support of America's worldwide war on terrorism, says Phyllis Bennis: The worlds leaders and the worlds government s did not object . To the cont rary. Bef ore Sept ember 11, out rage had been rising among French intellect uals over whet her the US hyperpower was behaving like a sovereign of an empire. Bef ore Sept ember 11, Russia was audibly object ing to US threat s to abandon the ABM treat y. Bef ore Sept ember 11, Europeans and others had begun caut ious effort s to punish Washingt on's lack of account abilit y to the internat ional communit y.... But by 10 AM on that Sept ember Tuesday, all those already hesit ant moves came to an abrupt stop. Inst ead, government s cheered and much of the world stood by as the US assert ed the right s of empire. x11 Wit h regard to the planned operat ion in Afghanist an in part icular Meyssan observes: \"The attacks of Sept ember 11 allowed what was not hing more than a classic colonial expedit ion to be disguised as a legit imat e operat ion. \" > 12 The fact that this tragedy for the count ry provided a tremendous opport unit y for the administ rat ion was widely underst ood. For example, John Pilger, after saying that \"[t]he attacks of 11 Sept ember 2001 provided the 'new Pearl Harbor, '\" added that these attacks have been \"described 'the opport unit y of ages. '\" > 13 They were described in those terms by the Bush administ rat ion itself . At the meet ing of the Nat ional Securit y Council on the night of 9/11, President Bush report edly said that the attacks provided \"a great opport unit y.\" > 14 A mont h later, Donald Rumsf eld told the New York Times that 9/11 creat ed \"the kind of opport unit ies that World War II offered, to ref ashion the world. \" > 15 Condoleezza Rice told senior members of the Nat ional Securit y Council to \"think about 'how do you capit alize on these opport unit ies. '\" > 16 This point was even put in The Nat ional Securit y Strat egy of the Unit ed States of America, issued by the Bush administ rat ion in Sept ember of 2002. \"The event s of Sept ember 11, 2001, \" it candidly declared, \"opened vast , new opport unit ies. \" > 17 \"Time and again, \" observers Pilger, \"11 Sept ember is described as an 'opport unit y.'\" The opport unit y provided by the attacks has been comment ed upon by many others. A story in US News and World Report said: Then came 9/11. Worldwide revulsion and the shared sense of threat handed Washingt on a once -in -a-generat ion chance to shake up internat ional polit ics. Ten days after the attacks, State Depart ment expert s cat alogued for [Colin] Powell a dozen \"silver linings. \" > 18 Walden Bello, one of the major third -world crit ics of the US -led global economy, likewise said: The Al Qaeda New York mission was the best possible gift to the US and the global est ablishment .... As for the crisis of polit ical governance in the US, Sept ember 11 has turned George W.

One would be naive to think the Bush Jr. fact ion and its oil, milit ary -indust rial and Wall Street backers. ..do not benef it ast ronomically from this mass -kill explosion.

The milit ary, the CIA, and every sat ellit e armed securit y apparat us have more money and power than ever, and become as dominant as they can over civilians in \"the whole new era\" already being declared by the Whit e House. > 22 Accordingly, given the principle that in general when crimes are commit ted, those who most benef it from them are to be considered the prime suspect s, there is a prima facie case for assuming that the Bush administ rat ion was involved in this part icular crime. Or, to repeat Pat rick Mart ins caref ul phrasing: \"It is reasonable to ask whet her those who have prof ited to such an ext ent from this tragedy cont ribut ed to bringing it about .\" Having argued, along wit h others, that the principle \"who most benef its?\" should lead us to suspect complicit y by the Bush administ rat ion, Ahmed then summarizes his evidence for this suspicion. The Evi dence for Offi cial Compl icity: A Summary Anmed's summary of his evidence, > 23 supplement ed wit h point s cont ribut ed by Chossudovsky, Thompson, Meyssan, and other researchers, cont ains the following element s: 1.

Evidence that men wit h connect ions to al-Qaeda were allowed into the Unit ed States in spit e of regulat ions that should have kept them out 3. Evidence that men wit h connect ions to al-Qaeda were allowed to train in US flight schools. 4. Evidence that the attacks of 9/11 could not have succeeded wit hout an order from the highest level of government to suspend normal operat ing procedures for responding to hijackings. 5. Evidence that US polit ical and milit ary leaders made misleading and even false statement s about their response to the hijackings. 6. Evidence in part icular that the present ly accept ed official account , according to which jet fight er planes were scrambled but arrived too late, was invent ed some days after 9/11. 7. Evidence that the collapse of the WTC buddings was brought about by explosives, so that part icipat ion by the US government in the prevent ion of an adequat e examinat ion of the debris, especially the steel, const itutes evidence of its part icipat ion in a cover -up. 8. Evidence that someone in aut horit y sought to ensure that there would be deat hs in the attacks on the second WTC tower and the Pent agon by not having these buildings evacuat ed. 9. Evidence that what hit the Pent agon was not a Boeing 757 but a much smaller aircraf t, such as a guided missile. 10. Evidence that Flight 93 was shot down after aut horit ies learned that the passengers were gaining cont rol of it. 11. Evidence that Secret ary of Def ense Rumsf eld revealed advance knowledge of two of the attacks. 12. Evidence that President Bush on 9/11 feigned ignorance of the occurrence and seriousness of the attacks. 13. Evidence that President Bush and his Secret Service knew on 9/11 that he would not be a target of attacks. 14. Evidence that the FBI had specif ic knowledge of the time and target s of the attacks at least a mont h in advance. 15. Evidence that the CIA and other intelligence agencies would have had very specif ic advance knowledge of the attacks by means of the put opt ions purchased short ly bef ore 9/11. 16.

Evidence against the alternat ive explanat ion—t he incompet ence theory—provided by the fact that those who were allegedly guilt y of incompet ence were not fired but , in some cases, promot ed. In summarizing his argument for complicit y (which cont ains many but not of all of these 24 point s), Ahmed adds that he does not pret end to have present ed a conclusive case. Rat her, he considers his conclusions to be \"merely the best available inferences from the available fact s that have been so far uneart hed. \" > 24 Possi ble Probl ems for a Compl icity Theory Ahmed is right to put it that way, because there well may be other fact s that would cast the fact s discussed by the revisionist s in a different light . Also, some of the items they have present ed as \"fact s\" may not be such; only furt her invest igat ions can decide. Moreover, the judgment that a case for some thesis is \"conclusive\" is always in part a subject ive judgment , depending upon the biases of those making the judgment . The quest ion, accordingly, is not whet her the case for official complicit y—t he best case that can be const ruct ed from the writ ings of Ahmed, Chossudovsky, Meyssan, Thompson, and other researchers—is conclusive. The quest ion is whet her it is likely to be widely perceived as conclusive. And for this to be so, crit ics of this revisionist theory could well claim, these revisionist s must do more than show that the official account is implausible. They must also present an alternat ive account of what happened that incorporat es all the relevant fact s now available in a plausible way. Furt hermore, these count er- crit ics could cont inue, insof ar as an alternat ive account is already cont ained, at least implicit ly, in the writ ings of the revisionist s, it could be subject ed to a great number of rhet orical quest ions, to which easy answers do not appear to be at hand. One such quest ion, for example, might be: If officials in the Bush administ rat ion want ed a new Pearl Harbor, why would they choose the set of event s that occurred on 9/11, which required a massive conspiracy, involving at least members of the Whit e House, the Just ice Depart ment , the FBI , the CIA, and the Pent agon ? (\"Choosing\" here need not imply part icipat ion in planning the attacks; it can simply mean \"choosing to allow. \") Given standard procedures for dealing wit h hijacked planes, furt hermore, allowing such planes to strike the WTC and the Pent agon required such obvious violat ions of standard procedures that the conspirat ors could hardly have expect ed not to be found out . They could, to be sure, have assumed that the shock of the attacks and the out burst of uncrit ical pat riot ism to follow would allow them to get away wit h the scheme for a while. But how could they have believed that the absurdit ies in their story would not event ually lead to their exposure ? So why would they have concoct ed such a complex scheme, requiring such absurdit ies, when virt ually the same effect s could have been achieved wit h a much simpler hoax, such as an attack by chemical or biological weapons, which could have been carried out by a very small number of perpet rat ors ? After all, the new Pearl Harbor did not need to mimic the original one to the ext ent of being an attack by airplanes. Furt hermore, even supposing that there was some rat ional reason for the administ rat ion to choose the kind of attacks that occurred on 9/11, why would they have risked exposure of the fact that the attack on the WTC was an inside job by having the buildings collapsed by explosives ? Was ensuring the occurrence of several thousand deat hs wort h this addit ional risk of exposure ? And why, in any case, would they have demolished WTC -7, thereby undermining the claim that the Twin Towers collapsed because of the impact of the airliners combined wit h the heat from the jet -fuel -fed fires ? Also, assuming for the sake of argument the revisionist s' conspiracy theory, there are many feat ures of the alleged conspirat ors' result ing behaviour that suggest s incompet ence beyond belief . For example, given the fact that if no planes were scrambled unt il after the Pent agon had been hit, this would obviously have required an order to cancel standard procedured, why would the conspirat ors first tell this story ? And then when they realized that that story would likely inplicat e them, why would they concoct a second version almost equally absurd—wit h planes ordered from dist ant air bases and wit h travel times implying that they were flying only a few hundred miles per hour ? Given the massive planning that must have gone into the whole operat ion, why was there not a caref ully formulat ed, plausible cover story that would be told by everyone from the out set ?"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"Moreover, crit ics can ask, why would the conspirat ors then raise addit ional doubt s wit h needless lies and foolish statement s? Why, for example, would they suggest that it required a president ial order merely to have hijacked planes intercept ed, when any cub report er could find out otherwise ? Why would they claim that they had received no advance warnings of the attacks, when the falsit y of this claim would surely be discovered ? Why would they have President Bush appear to be ignorant of the fact that the count ry was (apparent ly) under attack, when it is well known that he would be informed of such event s immediat ely ? Why would the president then, after officially knowing that a modern -day Pearl Harbor was unf olding, cont inue to do \"the reading thing\" ? And why would the president remain in his publicly known locat ion, thereby appearing to demonst rat e that he and his staff knew that no suicide missions were coming their way ? Would not the conspirat ors have orchest rat ed a scene that made the Secret Service appear genuinely concerned and the president genuinely president ial? Furt hermore, if Cheney, Rumsf eld, Wolf owit z, and Libby had been planning this incident when their Project for the New American Cent ury produced its 2000 document , why would they have allowed what could be read as a call for a \"new Pearl Harbor\" to be included in this public document , which anyone could read ? And why would Rumsf eld (assuming the trut h of Represent ative Cox's report ) predict the occurrence of more terrorist attacks on America just bef ore the first attack on the WTC and again just bef ore the attack on the Pent agon, thereby giving a basis for suspicion that he had foreknowledge of the fact and even the timing of the attacks ? Anot her set of rhet orical quest ions could be raised by the revisionist account of the attack on the Pent agon. One such quest ion might be: Given the well -known fact that the Pent agon is def ended by missiles, along wit h the more general assumpt ion that it must be the most well -prot ect ed place on eart h, why would the conspirat ors have it included among the target s? Or, if they did not choose the target s but merely allowed them to be hit, why—assuming that the original plan was for a hijacked airliner to strike the Pent agon—would the conspirat ors have planned to allow the Pent agon act ually to be hit, especially since shoot ing down an attacking airplane would have provided evidence of their intent to def end ? Or, if the theory is that the plan all along was to have the Pent agon struck by a milit ary aircraf t and then claim that it was a hijacked 757, why would they use a much smaller aircraf t, perhaps a winged missile, which many people would see and which would neit her creat e a big enough hole in the Pent agon nor leave enough big pieces of met al to be seen ? (Nowadays airplanes, not just guided missiles, can fly wit hout pilot s.) Or, if the alternat ive theory is that the use of this much smaller aircraf t was an improvisat ion, necessit ated by the fact that Flight 77 crashed unexpect edly (perhaps because the passengers resist ed the hijackers), why was there not a bet ter back -up plan ? Or bet ter yet , why did the conspirat ors not simply let this part of the plan go rat her than improvise a scenario the absurdit y of which would be visible to someone from as far away as France ? Why in any case did they make the totally ridiculous claim that the bodies of the vict ims were still ident ifiable, after they had claimed that the fire was so hot that it vaporized the plane's steel and aluminum ? Furt hermore, what plausible account can be given of the role of Ted Olson ? Are we to believe that upon learning that his wif e had just been killed in an operat ion overseen by his superiors, he willingly told a lie to help them out ? Or that the whole story was a hoax—t hat Barbara Olson was not really killed, which would mean that she would have to spend the rest of her life incognit o? And, in any case, why manuf act ure this implausible story—in which all the passengers are encouraged to call home but she is the only one to do so? There surely could have been some bet ter way to convey the impression that Flight 77 had not crashed and might be headed back to Washingt on. Finally, if the Boeing 757 that was Flight 77 crashed somewhere, perhaps in Ohio or Kent ucky, why have there been no report s of its discovery ? Still more rhet orical quest ions would doubt less be evoked by the account of Flight 93 implicit in the revisionist hypot hesis, according to which government officials, after realizing that the passengers were gaining cont rol of the plane, had it shot down. For example, why would not the conspirat ors, who could draw upon the best milit ary and CIA minds wit h experience in covert operat ions, have not come up wit h a bet ter back -up plan, such as inst alling a bomb that could be elect ronically det onat ed ? Why risk a met hod of disposal that would likely provide so many tell-tale signs, especially the sight ings of the jet fight er? Finally, crit ics of the complicit y theory might believe that the most damaging rhet orical quest ion arises precisely from the fact , emphasized by crit ics of the incompet ence theory, that there have been no known punishment s. If 9/11 result ed from a conspiracy, crit ics of this view could ask, why were there no scapegoat s? The official account involves, even if only implicidy, perhaps the most ext ensive incompet ence theory in hist ory, because this story implies that incredible incompet ence was manif est ed by FBI agent s, FAA flight cont rollers, NMCC officials, NORAD officials, and jet fight er pilot s, among others. There were pot ent ial scapegoat s galore, a few of whom could have been sacrif iced to prot ect the act ual conspirat ors from suspicion. Cont rary to virt ually all past experience, however, this was not done. Indeed, of all the people who must have manif est ed gross incompet ence if the official account be true, evidendy not one was fired or even publicly reprimanded, and some of them were even promot ed—t hereby increasing the suspicion that they had act ed as their superiors wished. But would such behavior not be too arrogant , attribut ing too much stupidit y or willing blindness to the press, to be believable ? Must we not assume that if"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"leading figures in the Bush administ rat ion were complicit in 9/11, they would have made a big show of punishing at least a few people for gross incompet ence ? These are, at least , the rhet orical quest ions that have occurred to me as I have tried imaginat ively to flesh out the complicit y theory that seems to be implicit in the crit iques of the official account . When all these rhet orical quest ions are taken toget her, it seems that we are faced not simply wit h a choice bet ween an incompet ence theory and a complicit y theory. Rat her, the choice seems to be bet ween a theory involving subordinat es who moment arily became incredibly incompet ent , on the one hand, and a theory involving high -level officials who manif est ed incredible incompet ence in creat ing a conspiracy, on the other. And to call this incompet ence \"incredible\" is to suggest that it is difficult to believe. Crit ics of the complicit y theory, theref ore, can say that accept ance of this theory would require excessive credulit y. Those who accept the theory of high -level conspirat ors could, to be sure, explain the apparent incompet ence of the plan by the theory of the \"big lie, \" according to which the masses are more likely to believe a big lie than a little one, precisely because they cannot imagine that someone would try to get a way wit h such an audacious story. Gore Vidal, for example, says: \"It would seem that the Hit ler team got it about right when it comes to human credulit y: the great er the lie, the more apt it is to be believed. \" > 25 It is unlikely, however, that this explanat ion will serve to overcome many peoples doubt that officials who had risen to the top in polit ical, intelligence, and milit ary circles would have devised a plan involving such an obviously implausible cover story. In suggest ing that it would be difficult to const ruct an account of official complicit y that could be found widely plausible, at least on the basis of present ly known fact s, I am simply enlarging on Ahmed's admission that he does not claim to have present ed a conclusive case. At this point , however, Ahmed, Chossudovsky, Meyssan, Thompson, and other crit ics of the official account might wish to interject a word of caut ion. The fact that there are quest ions that they cannot answer, they might add, should not be taken to mean that we are simply left wit h a toss -up bet ween two hypot heses, each of which is subject to equally serious quest ions. Inst ead, the quest ions they have raised about the official account are based on conf lict s bet ween this account and known fact s, whereas the quest ions just now raised about the complicit y theory are rhet orical quest ions, implying that no answers could be given to any of them. But perhaps answers can be given to at least some of them. For example, as to why the attacks involved attacks by airplanes, rat her than some other form of terrorist attack that could have been more easily arranged, an answer has already been implied. If one of the mot ives for the attack was to garner support for spending tens of billions of dollars on the Missile Def ense Shield, the attacks had to come from the air, being perceivable as a \"Space Pearl Harbor. \" Alt hough chemical and biological attacks would have been much simpler, requiring far fewer people to be in on the conspiracy, they would not have produced the desired effect . Wit h regard to the quest ion of whet her it is plausible that so many conspirat ors would have kept silent , the revisionist s could reply, people raising this quest ion have probably never experienced the kind of intimidat ion that can be brought to bear on individuals by threat s of prosecut ion and worse. Furt hermore, the revisionist s could add, some of the rhet orical quest ions depend on the fact that there are many things about 9/11 that we do not present ly know. These quest ions might be answered through a full invest igat ion. One cannot expect that the revisionist s, being independent researchers wit h limit ed budget s and no power to subpoena test imony, could answer all the quest ions raised by their alternat ive scenario. Meyssan, for example, says that although in some inst ances the fact s he has uncovered allow us to see the trut h of what happened, in other cases \"our quest ions remain for the moment unanswered. \" Point ing to one set of such quest ions to which he himself would most like answers, he asks: \"What became of American Airlines flight 77 ? Are the passenger dead ? If so, who killed them and why ? If not , where are they ?\" While fully admit ting he does not yet have all the answers, he adds that \"this is no reason to go on believing the lies put forward by officials. \" > 26 We will not get an account of what really happened on 9/11, in other words, unt il our awareness that they are lies leads us to demand full-scale invest igat ions. The remainder of the rhet orical quest ions simply suggest that to accept the complicit y theory would be to attribut e a degree of incompet ence to the conspirat ors that is beyond belief . But the trut h may be that they really were terribly incompet ent . Wit h regard to the occupat ion of Iraq, the incompet ence of the Bush administ rat ion's plans—f or everyt hing except winning the init ial milit ary vict ory and securing the oil fields and minist ries—has been becoming increasingly obvious. Perhaps their formulat ion of the plan for 9/11, wit h its cover story, involved comparable incompet ence. Perhaps this fact is not yet widely recognized only because the news media have failed to inform the American public about the many tensions bet ween the official account and the relevant fact s. For example, the mass media have not educat ed the public about standard operat ing procedures for intercept ing hijacked airliners. They have not emphasized the fact that what now passes for the official account of the government s response to the hijackings is very different from what was said the first few days after 9/11. They have not emphasized the fact"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"that the explanat ions for why the fight er jets arrived too late to prevent the attacks do not make sense. Nor have they informed the public about the many physical fact s that cont radict the official account of the strike on the Pent agon. Once these and other relevant fact s are well known, crit ics of the official theory can argue, it will become widely evident that , as the name of Jared Israels websit e suggest s, the emperor has no clot hes. > 27 Probl ems for a Coi nci dence Theory Even more import ant , crit ics ot the official account could point out , reject ion of the conspiracy theory exact s a high price. A conspiracy theory usually depends upon the percept ion of a pat tern, plus a claim that the exist ence of this pat tern is best explained by supposing that it was brought about through the combined effort s of two or more people. To reject a part icular conspiracy theory of this nat ure requires either a denial that the alleged pat tern exist s or the assert ion that the exist ence of the pat tern could be purely coincident al. It would be hard to deny that the crit ics of the official account have discerned a pat tern. They have shown that many otherwise puzzling event s—bef ore, during, and after 9/11—can be explained by the theory that high -level officials in the US government conspired to allow the attacks to occur and then to cover up this fact . Given that pat tern, the price for reject ing this conspiracy theory is to accept a coincidence theory. And, crit ics of the official account can point out , the number of coincidences that would need to be accept ed is enormous. A complet e list would include the following coincidences: 1. Several FAA flight cont rollers exhibit ed ext reme incompet ence on 9/11, and evidendy on that day only. 2. The officials in charge at bot h NMCC and NORAD also act ed incompet ent ly on 9/11, and evident ly on that day only. 3. In part icular, when NMCC -NORAD officials did finally order jet fight ers to be scrambled to prot ect New York and Washingt on, they ordered them in each case from more dist ant bases, rat her than from McGuire and Andrews, respect ively. 4. After public statement s saying that Andrews Air Force Base had no jet fight ers on alert to prot ect Washingt on, its websit e, which had previously said that many jets were always on alert , was altered. 5 Several pilot s who normally are airborne and going full speed in under three minut es all took much longer to get up on 9/11. 6. These same pilot s, flying planes capable of going 1,500 to 1,850 miles per hour, on that day were all evident ly able to get their planes to fly only 300 to 700 miles per hour. 7. The collapse of the buildings of the World Trade Cent er, besides occurring at almost free -fall speed, exhibit ed other signs of being cont rolled demolit ions: molt en steel, seismic shocks, and fine dust were all produced. 8. The video and physical evidence suggest ing that cont rolled demolit ion was the cause of the collapse of the Twin Towers co-exist s wit h test imony from people in these buildings that they heard, felt, and saw the effect s of explosions. 9. The collapse of WTC -1 and WTC -2 had some of the same feat ures as the collapse of WTC -7, even though the latter collapse could not be attribut ed to the impact and jet fuel of an airplane. 10. Bot h the Nort h Tower and the Sout h Tower collapsed just as their respect ive fires were dying down, even though this meant that the Sout h Tower, which had been hit second, collapsed first . 11. Government al agencies had the debris, including the steel, from the collapsed WTC buildings removed wit hout invest igat ion, which is what would be expect ed if the government want ed to prevent evidence of explosives from being discovered. 12. Physical evidence suggest ing that what hit the Pent agon could not have been a Boeing 757 co-exist s wit h test imony of several wit nesses that the aircraf t that did hit the Pent agon was far smaller than a 757. 13. This evidence about the aircraf t that hit the Pent agon co-exist s wit h report s that Flight 77 crashed in Kent ucky or Ohio. 14. This evidence co-exist s wit h the fact that the only evidence that Flight 77 did not crash was supplied by an attorney closely associat ed wit h the Bush administ rat ion. 15. Evidence that Flight 77 did not ret urn to Washingt on to hit the Pent agon co- exist s wit h the fact that when the flight cont rol transcript was released, the final 20 minut es were missing. 16. The fact that the aircraf t that hit the Pent agon did so only after execut ing a very difficult maneuver co-exist s wit h the fact that it struck a sect ion of the Pent agon that , besides cont aining none of its leaders, was the sect ion in which the strike would cause the least deat h and dest ruct ion. 17. On the same day in which jet fight ers were unable to prot ect the Pent agon from an attack by a single airplane, the missiles that normally prot ect the Pent agon also failed to do so. 18. Sounds from cell phones inside Flight 93 suggest ing that the plane had been hit by a missile were mat ched by many report s to this effect from wit nesses on the"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"ground. 19. This evidence that Flight 93 was shot down co-exist s wit h report s from bot h civilian and milit ary leaders that there was intent to shoot this flight down. 20. The only plane that was evident ly shot down, Flight 93, was the only one in which it appeared that passengers were going to gain cont rol. 21. The evidence that Flight 93 was shot down after the passengers were about to gain cont rol co-exist s wit h the fact that the flight cont rol transcript for this flight was not released. 22. That coincidence co-exist s wit h the fact that when the cockpit recording of Flight 93 was released, the final three minut es were missing. 23. Evidence showing that the US government had far more specif ic evidence of what was to occur on 9/11 than it has admit ted co-exist s wit h evidence that it act ively blocked invest igat ions that might have prevent ed the attacks. 24. Report s of obst ruct ions from FBI agent s in Minneapolis co-exist wit h similar report s from Chicago and New York. 25. Report s of such obst ruct ions prior to 9/11 co-exist wit h report s that invest igat ions after 9/11 were also obst ruct ed. 26. These report s of obst ruct ionism co-exist wit h mult iple report s suggest ing that the US government did not really try to capt ure or kill Osama bin Laden either prior to or after 9/11, wit h the result that several people independent ly suggest ed that the US government must be working for bin Laden—or vice versa. 27. All these report s co-exist wit h report s of hijackers being allowed in the count ry in spit e of known terrorist connect ions or visa violat ions. 28. These report s about immigrat ion violat ions co-exist wit h evidence that some of these same men were allowed to train at US flight schools, some on milit ary bases. 29. This evidence of training at various American flight schools co-exist s wit h report s that US officials tried to conceal this evidence. 30. The traumat ic event s of 9/11 occurred just a year after a document published by the Project for the New American Cent ury, an organizat ion whose founders included several men who became cent ral figures in the Bush administ rat ion, ref erred to benef its that could come from \"a new Pearl Harbor. \" 31. The \"unif ying Pearl Harbor sort of purple American fury\" produced by the 9/11 attacks did benef it the Bush administ rat ion in many ways. 32. A credible report that spokespersons for the Bush administ rat ion had earlier announced that the US government was planning a war on Afghanist an, which would begin bef ore the middle of Oct ober, co-exist s wit h the fact that the attacks of 9/11, by occurring on that dat e, gave US milit ary forces time to be ready to attack Afghanist an on Oct ober 7. 33. Ahmad Masood, whose cont inued exist ence would have posed problems for US plans in Afghanist an, was assassinat ed, report edly by ISI operat ives, just after the head of the ISI, General Mahmoud Ahmad, had been meet ing in Washingt on for several days wit h the head of the CIA. 34. In the Whit e Houses version of the recording of Condoleezza Rice's press brief ing on May 16, the only port ion that was inaudible was the port ion in which the person under discussion, ment ioned as having been in Washingt on on 9/11, was ident ified as \"the ISI chief .\" 35. Evidence of official effort s to conceal General Ahmad's presence in Washingt on co-exist s wit h evidence that , after it became known that General Ahmad had ordered $100, 000 wired to Mohamed Atta, US leaders exert ed pressure on the ISI to dismiss him from his post quiet ly. 36. Evidence of these attempt s to conceal General Ahmad's involvement in 9/11 co-exist s wit h evidence that the FBI and other federal agencies sought to obscure the fact that Saeed Sheikh, the man who wired the money to Atta, was an ISI agent . 37. The fact that agent s in FBI headquart ers who presided over the alleged intelligence failure that allowed 9/11 to happen, widely called the biggest intelligence failure since Pearl Harbor, were promot ed inst ead of fired or otherwise punished co-exist s wit h the fact that other intelligence agencies also report ed that there had been no punishment s for incompet ence relat ed to 9/11. 38. This evidence of lack of punishment for poor perf ormance co-exist s wit h report s that intelligence officers who were diligendy trying to pursue invest igat ions relat ed to 9/11 suf fered negat ive treat ment from superiors. As can be seen, what some crit ics call the incompet ence theory can be underst ood as simply part of a larger coincidence theory, because it ent ails that FAA agent s, NMCC and NORAD officials, pilot s, immigrat ion agent s, US milit ary leaders in Afghanist an, and numerous US intelligence agencies all coincident ally act ed wit h ext reme and unusual incompet ence when dealing wit h mat ters relat ed to 9/11."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"But the coincidence theory requires even great er credulit y. To accept it requires holding not only that each conjunct ion of event s on the above list -- which a conspiracy theory could explain by regarding each one as part of a pat tern of event s that had been planned — was purely coincident al. It also requires holding that the fact that there are so many event s relat ed to 9/11 that involve coincidences—at least 38 such event s—is itself purely coincident al. Seen in this light , the fact that a complicit y theory may not at this time be able to answer all the quest ions it evokes, revisionist s can say, is a relat ively trivial problem. Once the relevant fact s are put bef ore us, the official account involves a coincidence theory that would require far great er credulit y than that of which \"conspiracy theorist s\" are accused.

CHAPTER TEN THE NEED FOR A FULL INVESTI GATI ON I have argued that our Fourt h Est ate needs to carry out a thorough invest igat ion of the kind of informat ion summarized in this book. It is usually only when the press leads the way that an official invest igat ion is undert aken. But finally it will be the official invest igat ion that is decisive. In considering the kind of invest igat ion that is now needed, it will be helpf ul to review the official invest igat ions that have been aut horized thus far and the obst acles they have faced from the Bush administ rat ion. The Joi nt Inqui ry As we have seen, the intelligence commit tees of the US Senat e and House of Represent atives carried out a Joint Inquiry in 2002. As we have also seen, however, there are many reasons to consider the report issued by this inquiry inadequat e. For example, it concludes that US intelligence agencies, besides not having specif ic informat ion about imminent attacks, did not even expect attacks to occur wit hin the Unit ed States. The report does suggest that federal agencies were at fault . Indeed, the report was described by the press as a \"scat hing indict ment \" of the intelligence agencies. But the named problems—such as inadequat e communicat ion bet ween agencies, failure to make rat her obvious inferences, and failure to take warnings wit h suf ficient seriousness—all fit under the incompet ence and coincidence theories. In light of the evidence summarized in this book, the underlying weakness of the Joint Inquiry is that its members apparent ly simply assumed from the out set that no deliberat e complicit y was involved, as illust rat ed by the fact that the test imony of the various wit nesses was evident ly accept ed at face value. For example, if NSA officials said that they had not translat ed specif ic warnings that had been intercept ed bet ween Sept ember 8 and 10 unt il after the attacks, that test imony was simply accept ed as the trut h. If agent s at FBI headquart ers said that they misunderst ood the standards under FISA for issuing a warrant , that test imony was accept ed as the trut h, in spit e of evidence of deliberat e sabot age. There are several possible explanat ions for the inadequacy of the Joint Inquiry. One is simply that a thorough invest igat ion of the many quest ions raised by crit ics of the official account would have taken far more time and resources than were devot ed to this inquiry, which report edly involved only nine public hearings and thirt een closed sessions. But there is also reason to believe that intimidat ion may have dampened some of the members' invest igat ive zeal. Thompson cites a report that on August of 2002, FBI agent s had quest ioned nearly all 37 members of the Senat e and House intelligence commit tees about 9/11 - relat ed informat ion leaks. The agent s even demanded that these senat ors and represent atives submit to lie det ect or test s and turn over phone records and appoint ment calendars. A law prof essor, comment ing on this demand, said: \"It creat es a great chilling effect on those who would be crit ical of the FBI .\" > 1 Some senat ors and represent atives expressed grave concern about the violat ion of the separat ion of powers, wit h Senat or John McCain saying: \"What you have here is an organizat ion compiling dossiers on people who are invest igat ing the same organizat ion. \" The FBI , said one senat or, is \"trying to put a damper on our act ivit ies and I think they will be successf ul.\" > 2 Beyond the problems wit h the Joint Inquiry, the larger quest ion is why Congress did not immediat ely undert ake a full-scale invest igat ion into 9/11. Assigning the task simply to the intelligence commit tees implied that the success of the attacks of 9/11 was already known to be the result of not hing other than intelligence failures. A more sweeping invest igat ion was evident ly not undert aken because the congressional leaders acceded to request s from the Whit e House that the scope of their invest igat ion be limit ed. Bot h President Bush and Vice President Cheney, in personal appeals to Senat e Majorit y Leader Tom Daschle, report edly asked that only the House and Senat e intelligence commit tees look into the pot ent ial breakdowns among federal agencies"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"that could have allowed the terrorist attacks to occur, rat her than a broader inquiry that some lawmakers have proposed. \" Bush and Cheney were making this request , they said because a broader inquiry would take resources and personnel away from the war on terrorism. \" > 3 In light of the fact that Bush and Cheney must now be included among the prime suspect s, it would obviously be problemat ic if they had been allowed to det ermine the cause of the 9/11 attacks—t hat it was \"breakdown\" rat her than \"complicit y\"— and hencet o limit the scope of the invest igat ion carried out by the people's represent atives. We normally do not allow the suspect s in an invest igat ion to make such decisions. Nevert heless, in spit e of all these problems, the work of the Joint Inquiry was not in vain. It provided enough damaging revelat ions to leave President Bush, after having long opposed the creat ion of any special invest igat ing body, little choice but to support the creat ion of The Nat ional Commission on Terrorist Attacks upon the Unit ed States, informally known as the 9/11 Independent Commission. > 4 The 9/11 Independent Commi ssi on Alt hough it was good that this commission was finally creat ed, it has also been riddled wit h problems. One problem is that the Bush administ rat ion placed obst acles in front of it from the out set . An immediat e obst acle was the very small sum of money allocat ed by the administ rat ion to fund the commission's work. As of January 2003, the commission had been given only $3 million—whereas in 1996, by cont rast , a federal commission to study legalized gambling was given $5 million. > 5 In March of 2003, Time magazine report ed that the commission had asked the Bush administ rat ion for an addit ional $11 million but had been turned down. One commissioner, point ing out that the request was hardly excessive, not ed that the commission on the Columbia shut tle disast er, by cont rast , had $50 million. Stephen Push, one of the leaders of families of the vict ims, said that this ref usal suggest ed that the Bush administ rat ion saw this \"as a convenient way for allowing the commission to fail. They've never want ed the commission and I feel the Whit e House has always been looking for a way to kill it wit hout having their finger on the murder weapon. \" > 6 After more time passed, the addit ional funding was finally approved. Yet anot her obst acle was that although the commission's mandat e dict ated that it must complet e its work by May 2004, the Bush administ rat ion was very slow in issuing the needed securit y clearances to the commission's personnel. For example, even Slade Gort on, a former Republican US senat or wit h much experience wit h intelligence issues, still had not received a securit y clearance by March 12, 2003, leading the commissions vice chairman, former Democrat ic congressman Lee Hamilt on, to say: \"It's kind of ast ounding that someone like Senat or Gort on can't get immediat e clearance. \" > 7 As a result of these delays, by the time the commission was finally able to begin work in the middle of 2003, it had less than a year to carry out its work. Anot her obst acle was difficult y in obt aining needed document s and wit nesses. For one thing, although this commission was supposed to use the final report of the Joint Inquiry as a point of depart ure, the Bush administ rat ion did not allow this report to be released unt il late in July of 2003. Also, short ly bef ore this report was released, the commission's chairman, Thomas H. Kean, complained that the Just ice Depart ment and other federal agencies were wit hholding document s —which they obviously would not have done if they had been ordered by the Whit e House to turn them over. Kean also complained that federal agencies were insist ing on having \"minders\" present when any of their employees were called to give test imony, which Kean (reasonably) interpret ed as an attempt to intimidat e these employees. The Whit e House also indicat ed that the president himself would not give test imony, at least under oat h. In light of the enormous number of quest ions that have been raised about 9/11, these obst acles were probably by themselves suf ficient to prevent the commission from providing def init ive answers to most of the quest ions, even if the commission carried out the most independent , aggressive invest igat ion possible in the time remaining. Indeed, in Oct ober of 2003, one member of the commission, former senat or Max Cleland, told New York Times report er Philip Shenon that the commission could not complet e its work by May of 2004, adding: \"It's obvious that the Whit e House want s to run out the clock here. ... [W] e're still in negot iations wit h some assist ant Whit e House counsel about get ting these document s—it 's disgust ing. \" Alt hough Cleland is a Democrat , this attitude, report ed Shenon, was bipart isan, wit h Slade Gort on also complaining that the \"lack of cooperat ion\" would make it \"very difficult \" for the commission to complet e its work by the deadline. > 8 The obst acles creat ed by the Bush administ rat ion, however, were not the only problem. Anot her reason to doubt that the commissions report would answer many quest ions was that its leaders adopt ed a very limit ed underst anding of its task: \"The focus of the commission will be on the future, \" said Vice Chairman Hamilt on. \"We're not interest ed in trying to assess blame, we do not consider that part of the commission's responsibilit y.\" > 9 The commission, in other words, evident ly approached its task by simply taking for grant ed the trut h of the incompet ence theory, so that the quest ion of official complicit y would not even be explored. Hamilt on's words seemed,"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"in fact , to imply that the commission would not even assess blame in the sense of incompet ence. In saying that the commission's focus \"will be on the future, \" Hamilt on was apparent ly indicat ing that it would limit itself strict ly to the quest ion of how to make sure that a \"breakdown\" does not happen again. Now that we have bef ore us the quest ions raised by crit ics of the official account , along wit h the alternat ive theory implicit therein, we can see the absurdit y of such a limit ed mandat e. Any explanat ion of how the attacks on 9/11 could have occurred requires that there was either complicit y at the highest level of the U.S. government or an unprecedent ed syst em -wide breakdown in this count ry's abilit y to prot ect itself from a very crude form of attack—and this despit e the fact that a huge port ion of our nat ions trillion -dollar budget goes annually for \"def ense\" and \"int elligence. \" In the face of a seemingly forced choice bet ween these two explanat ions, the commissions failure to assess blame would be an enormous derelict ion of dut y. We need an invest igat ion that will seek to place blame where it belongs. We also need one that will not shrink from asking whet her 9/11 result ed from official complicit y rat her than merely massive incompet ence. To be fair to Hamilt on and the other members, it must be added that the commission's limit ed scope was perhaps imposed upon it. I have read report s that President Bush agreed to aut horize the 9/11 Independent Commission only on condit ion that its scope would be limit ed to the quest ion of how to prevent similar breakdowns in the future—in other words, only on condit ion that the commission would be independent in name only, not free to det ermine for itself the nat ure and scope of its invest igat ion. In any case, what ever be the fact s wit h regard to the commission's mandat e, the president clearly did make it a condit ion of his aut horizat ion of such a commission that he would appoint its chairman. > 10 Bush's first choice, which many observers found incredible, was Henry Kissinger. There was widespread scept icism about Kissinger's abilit y to guide the commission in an independent and impart ial way. > 11 \"Indeed, \" said the New York Times, \"it is tempt ing to wonder if the choice of Mr. Kissinger is not a clever maneuver by the Whit e House to cont ain an invest igat ion it long opposed. \" > 12 Skept icism about Kissinger's capacit y for independence was based in part on report s of possible conf lict s of interest , about which he evident ly had not been interrogat ed by the Whit e House. Kissinger, for one thing, was get ting huge consult ing fees from corporat ions wit h heavy invest ment s in Saudi Arabia. > 13 And, of course, besides report edly supplying many of the hijackers for 9/11, Saudi Arabia has been, according to John O'Neill and other intelligence agent s, the primary cont inuing source of support for al-Qaeda. Kissinger's relat ionship wit h Unocal—t he oil company wit h plans to build a pipeline through Afghanist an—was also report ed. > 14 The obvious problem here is that the attacks of 9/11 provided the basis for a war in Afghanist an, after which the Unit ed States inst alled a puppet government headed by a former Unocal employee and placed milit ary bases along the proposed rout e for the pipeline. The fact that Bush would appoint someone reput ed to be financially connect ed wit h Unocal as well as Saudi Arabia suggest ed, to say the least , that the impart ialit y of the commission's chairman was not his chief concern. Bush declared, in fact , that Kissinger was not required to reveal his business client s. The Congressional Research Service said otherwise, however, and Kissinger resigned rat her than do so. > 15 It was after this debacle that Thomas Kean became the chairman. Kean, formerly the governor of New Jersey, was the president of Drew Universit y at the time of his appoint ment . Because he was to cont inue as Drew's president , Kean would have only limit ed time to devot e to the commission. Crit ics also complained about possible conf lict s of interest , wit h the main problem being his membership on the Board of Direct ors for anot her oil company, Amerada Hess, wit h ext ensive invest ment s in Cent ral Asia. Amerada Hess had, furt hermore, joined wit h Delt a Oil of Saudi Arabia—one of the companies in the Cent Gas consort ium—t o form Hess -Delt a. > 16 All of the other members of the commit tee, furt hermore, report edly had at least one possible conf lict of interest . > 17 Also problemat ic is the fact that the president also appoint ed the commit tees execut ive direct or, Philip Zelikow, who had been deeply enmeshed wit h the Bush administ rat ion. He was appoint ed to Bush's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board short ly after 9/11. Back during the administ rat ion of the elder George Bush, he served wit h Condoleezza Rice in the Nat ional Securit y Council, then later collaborat ed wit h her on a book. > 18 Stephen Push, one of the founders of Families of Sept ember 11 comment ed on the problem of get ting \"commissioners and staff who are truly independent .\" He was uncomf ort able, he indicat ed, wit h the fact \"that Philip Zelikow has such a close relat ionship to Rice and other people the commission is invest igat ing. \" > 19 The Family Steering Commit tee for the 9/11 Independent Commission has, in fact , called on Zelikow to step down. > 20 Accordingly, given the make -up of the commission, people aware of the issues had reason to suspect that any evidence that the Bush administ rat ion itself was complicit in the event s of 9/11 would not be impart ially and thoroughly explored. Several good people were appoint ed to the"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"commission, and various issues were assigned to a number of commit tees, wit h capable and dedicat ed staff members. Report s indicat ed that these commit tees, under Kean's overall direct ion, were going somewhat beyond the limit ed scope originally suggest ed by Hamilt on's statement . But evident ly not very far: Even as late as Oct ober of 2003, a quot ation from one member of the commission seemed to suggest that its most import ant task would be \"making recommendat ions for the future. \" > 21 Nevert heless, cont inued stonewalling by the Whit e House and various agencies led to statement s by Kean suggest ing that he would be tenacious in obt aining evidence that the Bush administ rat ion and its various agencies were trying to wit hhold. The same mont h, in fact , Kean's commission issued a subpoena to the FAA, adding that this subpoena would \"put other agencies on not ice that our document request s must be taken as seriously as a subpoena. \" > 22 He also stated in an interview that he was ready to subpoena the Whit e House itself if necessary. In his strongest statement up to that point , Kean said: Any document that has to do wit h this invest igat ion cannot be beyond our reach. ... I will not stand for [stonewalling] .... We will use every tool at our command to get hold of every document .... There are a lot of theories about 9/11, and as long as there is any document out there that bears on any of those theories, we're going to leave quest ions unanswered. And we cannot leave quest ions unanswered. Assuming Kean was really serious about taking the various \"theories\" seriously and obt aining every available document relevant to them, there was the possibilit y that the commission might uncover evidence suggest ing that 9/11 happened more through complicit y than incompet ence. This possibilit y was suggest ed by Max Cleland's statement that , \"As each day goes by, we learn that this government knew a whole lot more about these terrorist s bef ore Sept . 11 than it has ever admit ted. \" > 23 But there was also the possibilit y, indeed the probabilit y, that this would not happen. And, regardless of people's assessment of Kean's integrit y, the fact remains that he was appoint ed by President Bush. At the time the commission was chosen, of course, the evidence that point ed to complicit y by the Bush administ rat ion was known by very few people, so acceding to Bush's insist ence that he should appoint the commission's leaders did not seem complet ely absurd. But insof ar as there is widespread knowledge of this evidence, the fact that the chairman was appoint ed by Bush will creat e suspicion that he, like Kissinger, was chosen for the sake of cont aining the invest igat ion. This suspicion might well be misplaced, at least if it is suspicion that Kean would, out of loyalt y to his part y and the president , deliberat ely conceal evidence of complicit y. Alt hough Kean is, like the president , a Republican, he is \"a moderat e Republican known for his independence, \" > 24 who report edly ref used to run for the US Senat e because of his disagreement wit h the direct ion being taken by his parry. The president perhaps select ed him to replace Kissinger not because he would be almost as saf e but because the administ rat ion did not want to risk anot her embarrassment . Nevert heless, because Kean, like Zelikow, was appoint ed by the president , a report by the commission exonerat ing President Bush and his administ rat ion of all wrongdoing would be suspect ed, by those who know the kinds of quest ions report ed in this book, of cont ribut ing to a cover -up, even if only through failure to exert the kind of pressure required to obt ain trut hful test imony and access to needed document s. This kind of failure was arguably illust rat ed, in fact , when in November of 2003 Kean agreed to rest rict ions demanded by the Whit e House wit h regard to those intelligence report s for the president known as PDBs, short for President ial Daily Brief s. (An example would be the PDB for August 6, 2001, which included the memo from Brit ish intelligence, discussed in Chapt er 5, which report edly indicat ed that terrorist s planned to use hijacked airliners as missiles to hit target s inside the Unit ed States. ) According to the agreement accept ed by Kean, the Whit e House would be allowed to edit these brief s bef ore sending them to the commission. And then only a few members of the commission would be allowed to see even these edit ed brief s. Then, besides only being able to take not es on these edit ed brief s, they would have to show these not es to the Whit e House. > 25 As Cleland described the deal that was struck: A minorit y of the commissioners will be able to see a minorit y of the [PDB] document s that the Whit e House has already said is pert inent . And then a minorit y of the commissioners themselves will have to brief the rest of the commissioners on what the Whit e House thinks is appropriat e.... [B]ut first they have to report to the Whit e House what they're going to tell the other commissioners. > 26 This agreement , cont inued Cleland, means that the commissioners are not able \"to fulfill their obligat ion to the Congress and the American people. \" Whereas the commissioners are supposed to get access to all the document s they need, \"the president of the Unit ed States is cherry -picking"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"what informat ion is shown to what minorit y of commissioners\"—a situat ion that Cleland labeled \"ridiculous. \" This decision produced the first public split wit hin the commission. Cleland, a Democrat , called the deal a \"bad deal, \" adding that this independent commission should be independent and should not be making deals wit h anybody. ... I don't think any independent commission can let an agency or the Whit e House dict ate to it how many commissioners see what .... [W] e shouldn't be dealing. If somebody want s to deal, we issue subpoenas. In his strongest charge, Cleland said: \"[T]hat decision compromised the mission of the 9/11 commission, pure and simple. \" > 27 Fellow Democrat Timot hy Roemer also reject ed this decision, complaining that the Whit e House might pass along \"only two or three paragraphs out of a nine - page report ,\" thereby allowing it to hide any \"smoking guns. This decision was also labeled \"unaccept able\" by the Family Steering Commit tee for the 9/11 Independent Commission, which declared: \"The commission should issue a statement to the American public fully explaining why this agreement was chosen in lieu of issuing subpoenas to the CIA and execut ive branch. \" Spokesperson Krist en Breirweiser added: \"This is an independent commission that is supposed to be transparent .\" > 28 Given these development s, everyone now, including those who fervent ly want the president and his administ rat ion to be freed from any suspicion of complicit y in the event s of 9/11, should support the aut horisat ion of a full invest igat ion led by someone, perhaps a special prosecut or, whose independence cannot reasonably be doubt ed. > 29 Everyone should now favour this regardless of the conclusions of the 9/11 Independent Commission. That is, if the commissions conclusion is that there was, or at least may have been, complicit y by the Bush administ rat ion, that conclusion would rat her obviously require the appoint ment of a special prosecut or. Alt ernat ively, if the commission denies that there was any complicit y, perhaps by failing even to raise the quest ion, a new invest igat ion would be needed for the reason given above—namely, that there will be widespread suspicion that the Bush administ rat ion, through its select ion of the chairman and execut ive direct or combined wit h its obst ruct ionism, prevent ed the trut h from being discovered. > 30 Recent Events After the manuscript for this book was essent ially finished, several event s occurred that drove home even more clearly the need for a new invest igat ion. These event s involved publicat ions, two president ial candidat es, a lawsuit , and the 9/11 Independent Commission. Publicat ions: Several recent publicat ions, by raising the kinds of quest ions dealt wit h in this book, suggest that these dist urbing quest ions, far from going away, will cont inue to be raised unt il credible answers are provided. One of these publicat ions was an art icle in the Guardian in Sept ember of 2003 by former Brit ish Minist er of the Environment Michael Meacher. Point ing out that the 2000 document produced by the Project for the New American Cent ury (PNAC) says that its agenda will be difficult to implement wit hout \"a new Pearl Harbor, \" Meacher suggest ed that this document \"provides a much bet ter explanat ion of what act ually happened bef ore, during, and after 9/11 than the global war on terrorism thesis. \" Wit h regard to event s prior to 9/11, he said that \"US aut horit ies did little or not hing to pre -empt the event s of 9/11\" even though \"at least 11 count ries provided advance warning to the US of the 9/11 attacks. \" > 31 Wit h regard to 9/11 itself , he said that wit h all the advance warnings America had, the slow react ion was \"ast onishing. \" Not a single fight er plane was scrambled to invest igat e from the US Andrews airf orce base, just 10 miles from Washingt on DC, unt il after the third plane had hit the Pent agon at 9.38 AM. > 32 Why not ? There were standard FAA intercept procedures for hijacked aircraf t bef ore 9/11. .. It is a US legal requirement that once an aircraf t has moved signif icant ly off its flight plan, fight er planes are sent up to invest igat e. Meacher then asked the crucial quest ion: Was this inact ion simply the result of key people disregarding, or being ignorant of, the evidence ? Or could US air securit y operat ions have been deliberat ely stood down on Sept ember 11 ? If so, why, and on whose aut horit y? Meacher then quot ed the former US federal crimes prosecut or, John Lof tus, as having said: The informat ion provided by European intelligence services prior to 9/11 was so ext ensive that it is no longer possible for either the CIA or FBI to assert a def ence of incompet ence."},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"Wit h regard to the American response after 9/11, Meacher said that 9/11 offered an ext remely convenient pret ext to put the PNAC plan into act ion. > 33 Meacher's art icle evoked much response. The nat ure of some of it was ref lect ed in the title of an art icle, \"Fury Over Meacher Claims, \" writ ten by Ewen MacAskill, the Guardian's diplomat ic edit or. > 34 As MacAskill report ed, a spokesman for the US embassy in London said: Mr. Meacher's fant ast ic allegat ions—especially his assert ion that the US government knowingly stood by while terrorist s killed some 3,000 innocent s in New York, Pennsylvania and Virginia—would be monst rous, and monst rously offensive, if they came from someone serious or credible. Having made such \"fant ast ic allegat ions, \" Meacher could be dismissed as neit her serious nor credible, in spit e of having been the UK's environment minist er for several years (who as such would have known somet hing about internal discussions of coming oil short ages). Equally dismissive was an art icle in London's Sunday Times, which said that Meacher had \"lurched into the twilight zone. \" > 35 At the same time, Meacher's art icle evoked a remarkable amount of support . One letter to the edit or from America said: \"It is obvious to me that the 'fury' attribut ed to represent atives of my government derives from their underst anding that his views cut close to the bone. \" Anot her American wrot e: \"Please let Mr. Meacher know that , despit e howls ofout rage and denial at his fort hright analysis, there are many of us who have long made the same deduct ions. My grat itude to the Guardian for having the courage to publish it.\" A writ er from England said: \"Kudos to Mr. Meacher for being the first prominent Brit ish polit ician to say what many have long known. But when will other senior Labour members have the courage to support him ?\" > 36 In any case, a week later, Meacher, perhaps reject ing the support he had received as well as the vilif icat ion, wrot e a second letter, which began: Cont rary to the wilf ul misrepresent ation by some of my art icle, I did not say at any point , and have never said, that the US government connived at the 9/11 attacks or deliberat ely allowed them to happen. It need hardly be said that I do not believe any government would conspire to cause such an atrocit y. > 37 He had only, he claims, argued that the US government had exploit ed 9/11 as a pret ext to carry out its already formulat ed agenda for Iraq and Afghanist an. However, given Meacher's quest ion whet her US securit y forces were \"deliberat ely stood down\" and his reject ion of a def ense based on \"incompet ence, \" the readers could surely be forgiven for having thought that he had charged official complicit y. > 38 But even if one accept s Meacher's statement that his original art icle was not meant to \"suggest a conspiracy theory, \" its cent ral point remains valid—t hat the failure of the US government to give sat isfact ory answers to the quest ions it raised \"has provided ample ammunit ion to those who do. \" Accordingly, his art icle, along wit h the posit ive responses it evoked, point s to the increasing sense that we need an invest igat ion aimed at answering these quest ions. Short ly after the Meacher flap an art icle appeared on the front page of the Wall Street Journal ent itled \"Conspiracy Theories About Sept ember 11 Get Hearing in Germany. \" > 39 While point ing out that books cont aining such theories have also become best -sellers in France, Italy, and Spain, this art icle said that such books have been especially well received in Germany, where a recent public opinion poll showed 20 percent of the citizens believing that \"the U.S. government ordered the attacks itself .\" This art icle focused in part icular on a best -selling book by Andreas von Bülow. > 40 Besides point ing out that von Bülow had been a long -time member of parliament after having been \"one of the top officials in the West German def ense depart ment ,\" this art icle added that his book was put out by \"one of the count ry's most prest igious publishing houses. \" Ian Johnson, the aut hor of this art icle, suggest ed that Germany is especially hospit able to 9/11 conspiracy theories, wit h their \"improbable and out rageous assert ions, \" because Germany has become increasingly host ile to American foreign policy. Johnsons art icle has, nevert heless, alert ed a signif icant readership to the fact that the charge of official US complicit y has been made by a highly credible public figure in Germany and is widely believed. A mont h after Meacher s original art icle appeared, freelance journalist Paul Donovan published a crit icism of journalist s who had attacked Meacher. Complaining that many journalist s seemed to be seduced by power, Donovan complained that although the \"premier role of the journalist should be as a check on power. ..many seem to...get great er job sat isfact ion as parrot s of the official trut h.\" After brief ly recount ing what he called \"the staggering story of the event s of 9/11, \" Donovan said:"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"No reasons have been given for the Bush administ rat ions conduct on that day, no one has been brought to account . Yet from the tragedy that was 9/11 Bush has been able to deliver for his backers in the arms and oil indust ries. The President has also been able to port ray himself as a wart ime leader. This is the real story that journalist s should be probing at and uncovering, not decrying the likes of Meacher who has at least had the gut s to stand up and say what many have suspect ed for some time. > 41 During the same period in which the Meacher, Johnson, and Donovan pieces were appearing, a new book by Michael Moore -- Dude Where's My Count ry? — was published. What ever one thinks of Moore, his books attract a huge readership (his previous book, Stupid Whit e Men, was the best -selling nonf iction book of 2002 -2003). In this new books first chapt er, ent iled \"George of Arabia\" Moore addresses seven quest ions to President Bush. One of them asks about Bushs behavior in the classroom on 9/11, but most of them deal wit h the relat ionship bet ween him and the Saudi royal family, the bin Laden family, and the Taliban. Moore's own hunch as to what really happened is evident ly ref lect ed in his third quest ion to President Bush: \"Who attacked the Unit ed States on Sept ember 11 — a guy on dialysis from a cave in Afghanist an, or your friends, Saudi Arabia ?\" > 42 Moore's strongest statement is one that provides a possible answer to why the Whit e House has been impeding the 9/11 Independent Commission and also to why the press and the American people in general have been so passive. Having asked why Bush does not \"st op prohibit ing the trut h from coming out ,\" Moore suggest s: Perhaps it's because George & Co. have a lot more to hide beyond why they didn't scramble the fight er jets fast enough on the morning of Sept ember 11. And maybe we, the people, are afraid to know the whole trut h because it could take us down roads where we don't want to go. This latter supposit ion—which is in harmony wit h Dan Rat her's statement that it is fear that has kept the press from asking the difficult quest ions—is probably correct . It is indeed fright ening to think that perhaps our government did, Michael Meacher's later statement not wit hst anding, \"conspire to cause such an atrocit y.\" It is especially fright ening to consider the implicat ions of such a conspiracy if it included the FBI , the CIA, the Just ice Depart ment , and the Pent agon. It might seem prudent simply to \"let sleeping dogs lie. \" If the suspicions are correct , however, these dogs are not sleeping, but are using the official account of 9/11 for various nef arious purposes, bot h wit hin our count ry and the rest of the world. Also, if we suspect foul play but keep silent out of fear, we can say farewell to any pret ense to being the \"land of the free and the home of the brave. \" And, in fact , to being a democracy. We may simply have to go \"down roads where we don't want to go. \" That some members of the American press may be ready to do this is suggest ed by the publicat ion on Sept ember 11, 2003, of an online art icle by William Bunch of the Philadelphia. Daily News ent ided \"Why Don't We Have Answers to These 9/11 Quest ions ?\" > 43 This is the art icle, ref erred to in the Introduct ion, that asks \"why after 730 days do we know so little about what really happened that day ?\" To illust rat e how much is still unknown, Bunch asks 20 quest ions, about half of which overlap wit h the cent ral quest ions of the present book. He then asks why \"a docile mainst ream media\" has not demanded answers to these quest ions. Perhaps his art icle in the Unit ed States, like Donovan's art icle in the unit ed Kingdom, is a sign that the press is ready to become less docile. A Candidat e's Statement about an \"Interest ing Theory\": During an interview on Nat ional Public Radio on December 1, 2003, Democrat ic president ial candidat e Howard Dean was asked, \"Why do you think he [Bush] is suppressing that [Sept . 11] report ?\" He replied: \"I don't know. There are many theories about it. The most interest ing theory that I've heard so far ... is that he was warned ahead of time by the Saudis. Now who knows what the real situat ion is?\" > 44 The task of disciplining Dean and warning others not to express such thought s in public was taken on by Charles Kraut hammer. In a Washingt on Post art icle ent itled \"Delusional Dean, \" Kraut hammer said that Dean's statement —t hat \"the most interest ing\" theory. ..is that Bush knew about Sept . 11 in advance\"—is evidence that Dean had been struck by a new psychiat ric condit ion that is abroad in the count ry. Kraut hammer labels this condit ion BDS, or \"Bush Derangement Syndrome, \" def ined as \"the acut e onset of paranoia in otherwise normal people in react ion to the policies, the presidency—nay—t he very exist ence of George W. Bush. \" Kraut hammer's piece provides an example of the standard approach taken by def enders of the official account . Rat her than dealing wit h any of the problems in this account , they simply declare that all theories of official complicit y are so obviously absurd that anyone taking such theories seriously must have deep psychological problems. Any problem wit h the official account alleged"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"by crit ics, such as evidence that the Bush administ rat ion had more informat ion about the attacks in advance than it has admit ted, is dismissed a priori. The offiicial account is thereby prot ect ed from scrut iny, and other people are warned not to raise quest ions. Alt hough Kraut hammer's art icle was obviously intended to be cleverly humorous, its serious intent was made clear by the following comparison: When Rep. Cynt hia McKinney (D-GA) first broached this idea [that Bush had advance knowledge] bef oret he 2002 primary elect ion, it was considered so nut ty it helped make her former represent ative McKinney. Today the Democrat ic president ial front -runner prof esses agnost icism as to whet her the president of the Unit ed States was tipped off about 9/11 by the Saudis, and it goes unnot iced. The virus is spreading. > 45 Writ ing several days after Dean's statement was broadcast , Kraut hammer appeared alarmed that Dean's statement had not evoked the same out cry that was raised against Congresswoman McKinney. Just as she was convict ed in the press and the court of public opinion of being too \"nut ty\" to remain in office, Kraut hammer was suggest ing, the press and the public should have taken Dean's statement as evidence that he, too, is unf it for public office. In alluding to Cynt hia McKinney's def eat in 2002, Kraut hammer was presupposing the convent ional wisdom as to the \"lesson\" to be drawn from it -- namely, that it is polit ical suicide for any candidat e, even a Democrat , to raise the quest ion of whet her the president had prior knowledge about the attacks of 9/11. An examinat ion of the circumst ances surrounding McKinneys def eat , however, suggest s that this might not necessarily be the case. There are at least three fact ors to be taken into considerat ion. In the first place, McKinneys quest ions about 9/11 were conf lated by the press wit h her statement s about the subsequent wars, wit h the result that it appeared to most people that she had charged not only that the president had specif ic foreknowledge of the attacks but that he had allowed them to happen for a very part icular reason. A story in the Orlando Sent inel for example, claimed that McKinney had assert ed \"that President George W. Bush knew about the 9-11 attacks in advance and did not hing to prevent them. Why? So that all his cronies could get rich on the subsequent milit ary buildup. \" > 46 A story in the New York Times said: \"Ms. McKinney suggest [ed] that President Bush might have known about the Sept ember 11 attacks but did not hing so his support ers could make money in a war. \" > 47 As Greg Palast and others have shown, however, the idea that McKinney charged Bush wit h allowing the attacks for this reason result ed from an illegit imat e conf lation of some of McKinneys statement s. Palast even present s good reason to believe that a similar conf lation lay behind the belief that McKinney had charged the Bush administ rat ion wit h having had specif ic knowledge of the attacks in advance. > 48 Palast argues, in fact , that McKinneys real posit ion was similar to his own, according to which several warnings had been given, so that the fact that the attacks were not ant icipat ed in time to prevent them point ed to a massive intelligence failure, for which the president 's policies were at least part ly responsible. > 49 In any case, what ever McKinneys act ual intent , she was not present ed to the public as having simply suggest ed that there should be an invest igat ion of whet her the Bush administ rat ion had prior knowledge. There is, furt hermore, a second reason why her elect oral def eat does not necessarily mean that making such a suggest ion would be polit ical suicide, even for a Democrat . In Georgia, vot ers in a primary elect ion are allowed to \"cross over, \" so that regist ered Republicans, for example, can choose to vot e in the Democrat ic primary. According to McKinney's account of what happened, anot her black woman, wit h posit ions closer to those of the Republican part y, was urged by Republicans to run against McKinney in the primary, after which \"Republicans fed her campaign cof fers and then 48, 000 of them crossed over and vot ed for her. \" > 50 Alt hough Georgia's vot ing laws make it impossible to know how many cross -over vot ers there act ually were, McKinney's general claim is support ed by John Sugg, senior edit or of Atlant a's weekly paper, who said: \"Republicans crossed over in droves to vot e in the Democrat ic primary. \" > 51 Still anot her relevant fact concerns an online poll set up on April 17 by the Atlant a Journal - Const itution. The poll's quest ion was based on the assumpt ion that McKinney had charged that the president had advance knowledge of the attacks. People were asked: \"Are you sat isfied the Bush administ rat ion had no advance warning of the Sept ember 11 attacks ?\" Given the fact that the AJC was one of the newspapers that led the attack on McKinney, the purpose of the poll was evident ly to show that McKinney's charge had little if any public support . But according to NewsMax. com—a websit e that shared the AJCs host ility to McKinney—only 52 percent responded affirmat ively. Two percent of the respondent s chose the answer, \"I'm not sure. Congress should invest igat e,\" while the other possible answer, \"No, I think officials knew it was coming, \" was select ed by 46 percent of the responders. Hence the title put on the story: \"Poll Shocker: Nearly Half Support McKinney's 9/11 Conspiracy Theory. \" The writ er of this story, which was post ed short ly after 3:30 PM, added: \"Though over 23, 000 Atlant a Journal -Const itution readers had responded by midaf ternoon, the poll has been myst eriously wit hdrawn from the"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"paper's web site.\" > 52 Such polls are not , of course, scient ific. But this one does raise an interest ing quest ion, which is what the result s of a scient ific poll taken in the Unit ed States would be. No such poll has been taken—perhaps on the basis of the old advice: \"If you don't want to know the answer, don't ask the quest ion. \" But perhaps if such a poll were to be taken, we would find that public opinion in America regarding the Bush administ rat ion's relat ion to 9/11 is closer to public opinion in Germany than had been assumed. It is, at least , an interest ing quest ion, which could be test ed. In any case, these three fact s—t hat Cynt hia McKinney's \"charge\" was dist ort ed, that apart from the cross -over vot e she might not have been def eat ed, and that a remarkable percent age of the people in the Atlant a area evident ly believed already in April of 2002 that \"of ficials knew it was coming\"—suggest that her def eat does not necessarily prove that it would be polit ical suicide for any polit ician to point to evidence suggest ing that the Bush administ rat ion had foreknowledge of the attacks. Be that as it may, the fact that the quest ion of such foreknowledge was raised by a president ial candidat e, whose quest ion was then publicized by a prominent journalist , provides yet furt her evidence that an invest igat ion into this very quest ion is needed. Ellen Mariani's Complaint : Still furt her evidence is provided by anot her recent event —a lawsuit that makes a charge not wholly unlike the charge Cynt hia McKinney was thought to have made. > 53 On November 26, 2003, attorney Philip J. Berg held a news conf erence in Philadelphia to announce that Ellen Mariani, whose husband was on Unit ed Airlines Flight 175, had filed a Federal Court Complaint against President Bush and several members of his cabinet under the RICO (Racket eer Influenced and Corrupt Organizat ions) Act . > 54 This Complaint alleges that George W. Bush (GWB) and other officials -including John Ashcrof t, Dick Cheney, Condoleezza Rice, Donald Rumsf eld, and George Tenet —are guilt y \"for 'failing to act and prevent ' the murder of Plaint iff's husband, Louis Neil Mariani, for financial and polit ical reasons\" and that they \"have 'obst ruct ed just ice' in the aftermat h of said criminal act s and omissions. \" > 55 In elaborat ing on this summary charge, the Complaint says, among other things: Def endant GWB \"owed a dut y\" not only to Plaint iff, but the American People to prot ect and def end against the prevent able attacks based upon subst amial intelligence known to Def endant GWB prior to 911\" which result ed in the deat h of Plaint iffs husband and thousands of other innocent vict ims on \"911. \"... Def endant GWB has not been fort hright and honest wit h regard to his administ rat ions pre -knowledge of the pot ent ial of the \"911\" attacks and Plaint iff seeks to compel Def endant GWB to just ify why her husband Louis Neil Mariani died on \"911. \"...[T]he compelling evidence that will be present ed in this case through discovery, subpoena power by this Court and test imony at trial will lead to one undisput ed fact , Def endant GWB failed to act and prevent \"911\" knowing the attacks would lead to our nat ion having to engage in an \"Internat ional War on Terror (IWOT)\" which would benef it Def endant s bot h financially and for polit ical reasons. ... Plaint iff believes, Def endant GWB et al, allowed the attacks to take place to compel public anger and out cry to engage our nat ion and our milit ary men and women in a prevent able \"IWOT\" for personal gains and agendas. ... Special Agent Robert Wright wrot e a memo on June 9, 2001, warning his superiors, Def endant DOJ/ FBI of the pot ent ial of terrorist s hijacking aircraf t to attack the Unit ed States and two (2) mont hs later, Def endant GWB's Nat ional Securit y Advisor, Def endant Condoleezza Rice, acknowledged that on August 6, 2001. ..she provided a writ ten brief to Def endant GWB at his Texas ranch which warned \"OBL\" might try to hijack US aircraf t. Plaint iff... [has] a \"right to know\" why these report s provided Def endant GWB were not act ed upon to prevent the most deadly attacks against our nat ion since Pearl Harbor, which led us into World War II, as \"911\" is now leading us into the never ending \"IWOT. \" From the mount ain of evidence and the ongoing \"secrecy\" of Def endant GWB and his unwillingness to cooperat e wit h the \"911 Commission, \" Plaint iff brings this RICO Act civil act ion to obt ain just ice for herself and husband Louis Neil Mariani and to expose the \"trut h\" to the American public as to the great bet rayal Def endant s have inflict ed upon each and every freedom -loving American arising from the crimes prior to, during and after \"911. \" > 56 Besides providing copies of this Complaint , Berg also handed out an open letter to the president from Ellen Mariani. In this letter, she says Stop blocking the release of cert ain evidence and document s that were discovered"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"by the 9/11 Invest igat ion Commission if you have not hing to hide proving you did not fail to act and prevent the attacks of 9/11.

This suit , along wit h the Dean -Kraut hammer exchange and several recent publicat ions, suggest that these quest ions will be raised wit h increasing frequency and intensit y. More and more citizens will believe that the official account is a lie. The only solut ion compat ible wit h a democrat ic form of government is an invest igat ion that finally provides a credible account of what happened on 9/11. That this may need to be a new invest igat ion has been furt her suggest ed by recent development s in relat ion to the 9/11 Independent Commission. The 9/11 Independent Commission: In spit e of all the problems that have hobbled this commission, many people, including leaders of the Family Steering Commit tee, had long held ont o some hope that it would finally provide answers to at least some of the many unanswered quest ions. But that hope has been undermined by furt her development s. First , the previously discussed agreement by the commission to work out a deal wit h the Whit e House, inst ead of using its subpoena power, gave support to the charge that it should be called \"the 9/11 Coverup Commission. \" > 58 Second, the commission lost its most out spoken crit ical member, Max Cleland. > 59 Third, the quest ion of conf lict s of interest was raised anew in mid -January by the revelat ion in a New York Times story that the commission had interviewed two of its own members, execut ive direct or Philip Zelikow and commissioner Jamie Gorelick (who was a senior member of the Just ice Depart ment during the Clint on administ rat ion). This revelat ion raised the quest ion wit h special intensit y because Zelikow and Gorelick are \"the only two commission officials wit h wide access to highly classif ied Whit e House document s.\" When asked about the news that Zelikow had been interviewed, Krist en Breit weiser said: \"He has a huge conf lict of interest ,\" adding: \"This is what we've been concerned about from Day 1.\" Elaborat ing on this concern, she feared, she said, that the commission report \"is going to be a whit ewash. '' > 60 A fourt h blow to the hope that the commissions report will answer atleast some of the quest ions will be delivered if the commissions request foraddit ional time is ref used. As we saw earlier, commission members had long worried that the obst ades creat ed by the Whit e House would make it impossible for them to complet e their work by the end of May. Lat e in January, die commission formally request ed that it be given a few mont hs more so that its work could be, in the words of Timot hy Roemer, \"credible and thorough. \" But the init ial response to this request was negat ive. The commission members should \"be able to meet that deadline, \" said a spokesperson for the administ rat ion, since \"[t]he administ rat ion has given them an unprecedent ed amount of cooperat ion. \" > 61 In an art icle about this response (ent ided \"What 's Bush Hiding From 9/11 Commission ?\"), Joe Conason said that from the out set \"Mr. Bush has treat ed the commission and its essent ial work wit h cont empt ,\" cont inually working \"to undermine, rest rict and censor the invest igat ion of the most signif icant event of his Presidency. \" Ref erring to a report in Newsweek that the administ rat ion gave the commission the choice of meet ing the May deadline or post poning release of the report unt il December—which would be, of course, after the November elect ions— Conason comment ed; \"Mr. Bush doesn't want his re-elect ion subject to any informed judgment about the disast er that reshaped the nat ion and his Presidency. \" > 62 Nevert heless, in spit e of the cont inued stonewalling, the commission, according to the most recent report s as this book was going to press, was not planning to issue subpoenas to President Bush, Vice President Cheney, or other administ rat ion officials to require mem to test ify under oat h. > 63 These recent development s have evidendy been the final straw for at least some members of the Family Steering Commit tee. According to a story in the Washingt on Post , \"The commissions handling of the deadline has angered a group of relat ives of Sept . 11 vict ims, who argue that the panel has not been aggressive enough in demanding more time and in seeking key document s and test imony from the Bush administ rat ion. \" The report er then quot ed Krist en Breit weiser as saying: \"We've had it....

Philip Shenon of the New York Times wrot e: Mr. Cleland's intent ion to resign from the 10 - member commission has been known since last summer, when Senat e Democrat s announced that they had recommended him for a Democrat ic slot on the board of the Export -Import Bank But the timing of his depart ure became clear only last week when the Whit e House formally sent the nominat ion to the Senat e. His imminent depart ure from the panel has creat ed concern among vict ims' family groups, because Mr. Cleland has been one of the commission's most out spoken members and has joined wit h advocat es for the families in their crit icism of the Bush administ rat ion. (Philip Shenon, \"Ex -Senat or Will Soon Leave 9/11 Panel, \" New York Times, December 5, 2003. ) Suspicious minds might , of course, speculat e that the Whit e House speeded up the nominat ion process because it would rat her have the out spoken Cleland on the board of the Export -Import Bank than on the commission invest igat ing 9/11. In any case, a few days later it was announced that Tom Daschle, the leader of the Senat e's Democrat s, had select ed Bob Kerrey, the former Democrat ic senat or from Nebraska (who had been vice chairman of the Senat e Intelligence Commit tee), to replace Cleland (Philip Shenon, \"Ex -Senat or Kerrey Is Named to Federal 9/11 Commission, \" New York Times, December 9, 2003). 28 Shenon, \"Deal on 9/11 Brief ings Let s Whit e House Edit Papers. \" 29 In saying that \"everyone\" should favor this, I mean, of course, everyone innocent of complicit y in the attacks of 9/11. 30 The suspicious attitude toward the 9/11 Independent Commission held by many of those who have studied the evidence for official complicit y is illust rat ed by an art icle that ref ers to it as \"the 9-11 Coverup Commission. \" Wit h regard to Kean himself , this art icle predict ed: \"To ensure that the 9-11 Coverup Commission project s an image of at least 'trying, ' the commission's chairman Thomas H.

Kean's agreement , after threat ening to subpoena the Whit e House, to allow it to edit the president ial brief s could be seen as a fulfillment of this predict ion, so this agreement probably increased the suspicion. 31 Michael Meacher, \"This War on Terrorism is Bogus, \" Guardian, Sept ember 5, 2003. 32 In response, one debunker, Jon Ungoed -Thomas, wrot e: \"However, logs compiled by the Nort h American Aerospace Def ense Command record that it learnt of a possible hijacking at 8.40 AM.

This conf lict of opinion ref lect s the fact , of which most people still seem unaware, that there have been two versions of the official account on this mat ter. Meacher cited the first account (whet her because it was the account he accept ed or the only one he knew), then Ungoed -Thomas \"ref uted\" him by citing the second (perhaps because it was the only one he knew) . That issue aside, there are several other problems wit h Ungoed -Thomas' attempt to def end the official account .

Then, having provided this ref utation, at least to his own sat isfact ion, Ungoed -Thomas asks: \"Why do so many people cleave to these theories when there are such discrepancies and perf ect ly reasonable explanat ions ?\" He answers this quest ion by citing a psychologist who explains that adherent s of conspiracy theories \"are driven by a thirst for cert aint y in an uncert ain world. \" We can ignore 9/11 conspiracy theories, in other words, because they are simply product s of pat het ic minds—not of minds that have not iced conf lict s bet ween the official account and the fact s. 33 Michael Meacher, \"This War on Terrorism is Bogus, \" Guardian, Sept ember 5, 2003. 34 Ewen MacAskill, \"Fury Over Meacher Claims, \" Guardian, Sept ember 6, 2003. 35 This statement is in the art icle by Jon Ungoed -Thomas quot ed in not e 32, above. 36 The letters all appeared in the Guardian on Sept ember 8, 2003; they were accompanied by many letters denouncing Meacher. 37 Michael Meacher, \"Cock -Up Not Conspiracy, \" Guardian, Sept ember 13, 2003. 38 That this was a nat ural interpret ation of his art icle is suggest ed by the fact that Ian Johnson, whose Wall Street Journal art icle is discussed next , said that Meacher had writ ten \"a blist ering attack. ..implying that Washingt on was involved in the attacks to just ify a more intervent ionist foreign policy. \" 39 Ian Johnson, \"Conspiracy Theories About Sept ember 11 get Hearing in Germany, \" Wall Street Journal, Sept ember 29, 2003. 40 The English translat ion of the title of Andreas von Bülows book would be \"The CIA and the 11 th of Sept ember: Internat ional Terror and the Role of the Secret Services\" (Munich: Piper Vcrlag, 2003).

In her prepared statement , after saying that the US government had received numerous warnings prior to 9/11, she asked: \"What did this Administ rat ion know, and when did it know it, about the event s of Sept ember 11 ? Who else knew and why did they not warn the innocent people of New York who were needlessly murdered ?\" She also said, in a different paragraph, that \"persons close to this Administ rat ion are poised to make huge prof its off America's new war. \" These statement s cont ain three dist inct element s: (1) the quest ion of what the Bush administ rat ion knew—which ref erred back to her statement that \"[w]e know there were numerous warnings of the event s to come on Sept ember 11. Vladimir Put in, President of Russia, delivered one such warning\"; (2) the suggest ion that some people had foreknowledge of the attacks of 9/11 and failed to issue a warning—which ref erred to her earlier statement that \"[t]hose engaged in unusual stock trades immediat ely bef ore Sept ember 11 knew enough to make millions of dollars from Unit ed and American airlines, cert ain insurance and brokerage firms' stocks\"; and (3) her assert ion that some persons close to the Bush administ rat ion would prof it financially from the US war on terrorism. However, as her statement s were repeat ed in the mainline press (af ter they were publicized by an April 12 story in the Washingt on Post under the headline \"Democrat Implies Sept ember 11 Administ rat ion Plot \"), these three element s became conf lated. The conf lation made by Kat hleen Parker of the Orlando Sent inal on April 17 was quot ed in the text . On June 16. a show on NPR (Nat ional Public Radio) claimed that McKinney \"suggest ed the Bush Administ rat ion may have known in advance about the Sept ember 11 attacks and allowed them to happen in order for people dose to the President to prof it.\" To back up this claim. NPR played these words from the Pacif ica broadcast : \"What did this administ rat ion know, and when did it know it, about the event s of Sept ember 11 th? Who else knew, and why did they not warn the innocent people of New York"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"who were needlessly murdered ?...What do they have to hide ?\" The problem here is that the final quest ion, \"What do they have to hide ?\", came later in the program, during the interview. while McKinney was discussing the request s by bot h the president and the vice president to Tom Daschle that he not have a Senat e invest igat ion. By quot ing that statement out of cont ext . NPR made it appear that the \"they\" in the prior sent ence—t he \"they\" who had specif ic knowledge about the event s in advance—ref erred to members of the Bush administ rat ion. NPR then played anot her statement made during the interview— \"And so we get this presidency. ..request ing a nearly unprecedent ed amount of money to go into a def ense budget for def ense spending that will direct ly benef it his father. \" By conf lating this statement wit h the earlier one, NPR made it sound as if McKinney was charging that this was the president s mot ive for allowing the attacks to proceed. For Palast 's analysis of this conf lation, see his \"Re -Lynching Cynt hia McKinney, \" July 21, 2003 (www. gregpalast .com/ det ail. cfm?art id=232). Palast 's analysis is support ed by John Sugg. Having said that the most infamous assault against McKinney \"was the claim that she had quest ioned whet her Dubya had knowledge of 9-11 bef ore it happened, and that he didn't act because his dad and cronies were going to make bundles off the war machine, \" Sugg adds: \"The trut h was that McKinney quit e accurat ely predict ed—mont hs bef ore it broke in the press—t hat Bush had ext ensive intelligence on likely terrorist attacks and failed to act . And McKinney was equally accurat e in saying that Bush insiders would reap windf alls from slaught er. However, nowhere did McKinney ever link the two statement s\" (John Sugg, \"Trut h in Exile: US Report er Breaks Bush Blockbust ers—on English TV, \" Creat ive Loaf ing.

Oh, yes, if that 's what you want to read. But report ers are not supposed to play 'Got cha! ' wit h such serious mat ters.
