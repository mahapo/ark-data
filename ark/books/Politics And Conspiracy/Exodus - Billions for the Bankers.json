It will end with less and less welf are, health care, pensions, etc., and f inally end with riots in the streets and a tyrant running our governm ent. You m ay say it can' t happen here. It is happening in every country in the world where debt and interest becom es unpayable. WHAT IS WRONG WITH CANADA? In 1867 the Fathers of Confederation gave the federal governm ent (under Section 91 of the British North Am erica Act) the right to create Canada' s m oney supply. However, our federal governm ent has given this right to the private chartered banks. Instead of getting our m oney supply for the cost of printing, our federal governm ent now borrows the m oney from the chartered banks and pays over $40 billion per year interest. Paym ent of this interest took 33% of all the taxes collected in the last fiscal year. This m eans all businesses, farm ers and individuals also have to borrow our m oney supply. Because m oney to pay this interest is never issued, we have to borrow the m oney to pay the interest. Thus borrowing drives all of us, including our governm ents, deeper and deeper into debt. The Good Book says, that the borrower is the servant of the lender. So, m ost of us, including our governm ents, are servants of the lender, nam ely, the private banks. HERE IS WHAT THIS SYSTEM HAS ALREADY DONE TO US. (NOTE: The \"progress\" shown between 1990 and 1993 ha s com e at the expense of billions of dollars in new taxes like the G.S.T. and billions m ore in im portant program cuts. The results? A reduction in the per person debt load by a m ere $71! Besides, this \"per person\" cost is only lower because of a growth in the population from 27 m illion to 29 m illion). Our interest paym ents on the federal debt alone have increased a thousand tim es in the last 80 years. It is only a m atter of tim e now until the International Monetary Fund and their fellow bankers refuse more credit. Canada will then be in the sam e situation as the third world countries. "},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" What Do The Experts Say? ______________________ THERE IS AN ANSWER ______________________ Toward a Sustainable Financial System for Canada by John H. Hotson - Professor of Economics, Waterloo University The most thorough going, and most beneficial, reform of Canadian banking would be for the Bank of Canada to buy back from the Chartered Banks all federal debt they hold, plus sufficient other assets to equal 100% of their demand deposits (M1a) liabilities, and then require them hence forth to maintain 100% reserves against all deposits transferable by cheque. At one stroke this reform would end our present fractional reserve or \"private mints system\" by which the banks create 95% of the money we use as they make loans. The Bank of Canada, or the Department of Finance, if this were desired, would then become the sole creator of money and the private banks would be reduced to their role of re-lending savings deposited with them without money creation. There is only one answer to calamity and that is MONETARY REFORM.

"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"BILLIONS for the BANKERS DEBTS for the PEOPLE Canadians living in what is called one of the richest countries in natural resources per capita on earth, seem to be short of m oney. Fam ilies require two wage earners just to survive as wives are working in unprecedented num bers, husbands hope for overtim e hours to earn m ore, or either take extra part-tim e jobs evenings and weekends; children look for odd jobs for spending m oney; the fam ily debt clim bs higher; and, psychologists say one of the biggest causes of fam ily quarrels and breakups is \"argum ents over m oney.\" Much of this trouble can be traced to our present \"debt- money\" system . Few Canadians realize why the Fathers of Conf ederation wrote into the British North Am erica Act (under Section 91, Clause 14 and 15), that Legislativ e Authority of Parliam ent shall have the power to issue \"Currency and Coinage\" and \"Banking, Incorporation of Banks, and the Issue of Paper Money\". They did this, in prayerful hope that it would prevent the love of m oney from destroying the dem ocratic governm ent they had founded. MONEY IS MAN'S ONL Y \"CREA TION\" Econom ists use the word \"create\" when speaking of the process by which m oney com es into existence. New creation m eans m aking som ething that did not exist before. Lum berm en m ake boards from trees; workers build houses from lum ber; and, factories m anufacture autom obiles from metal, glass and other m aterials. But in all these they did not \"create\" - they only changed existing materials into a m ore usable and therefore m ore valuable form . This is not so with m oney.

W ith different figures it can buy the autom obile or even the house. Its value has been \"created\" in the true m eaning of the word. MONEY \"CREATING\" IS VERY PROFITABLE As is seen by the above, m oney is very cheap to m ake, and whoever does the \"creating\" of m oney in a nation can m ake a trem endous profit! Builders work hard to m ake a profit of 5% above their cost to build a house. Auto m akers sell their cars for 1% to 2% above the cost of m anufacture and it is considered good business. But m oney \"m anuf acturers\" have no lim it on their prof its, since a f ew cents will print either a $1 bill or a $10,000 bill. That profit is part of our story.

For an exam ple, we need only look at the Great Depression of the early 1930s. THE BANKERS DEPRESSION OF THE 1930's In 1930 Canada did not lack industrial capacity, fertile farm land, skilled and willing workers or industrious farm fam ilies. It had an extensive and highly efficient transportation system in railroads, road networks, and inland and ocean waterways. Com munications between regions and localities were the best in the world, utilizing telephone, teletype, radio and a well-operated governm ent m ail system . No war had ravaged the cities or the c ountryside, no pestilence weakened the population, nor had fam ine stalked the land. The Canadian econom y in 1930 lacked only one thing: an adequate supply of m oney to carry on trade and com merce. Bankers, the source of Canada' s m oney and credit, had deliberately withheld m illions f rom circulation by refusing loans to stable and growing industries, stores and farm ers. At the sam e tim e they dem anded paym ent on existing loans so that m oney was rapidly taken out of circulation and was not replaced. Canada was put in a \"depression\" a nd in deep trouble. Goods were available to be purchased, jobs waiting to be done, but little m oney. Twenty-five percent of the workers were laid off. Banks took possession of tens of thousands of farm s and businesses on foreclosure. Gloom settled over Canada and we can only visualize the results if this had continued 20 years instead of 10. WAR ENDED \"DEPRESSION\" Our \"depression\" lasted until 1939, when the Canadian Governm ent began to spend large am ounts of money into circulation for m ilitary preparedness for ourselves and future allies in Europe. As soon as the m oney supply went up people were hired back to work, farm s sold their produce instead of plowing it under, m ines reopened, factories began to hum and both industrial and residential construction began anew. The \"Great Depression\" was over. Som e politicians were blam ed f or it and"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"others took credit for ending it. The truth was that lack of m oney caused it and adequate supply ended it. The people were never told the sim ple truth and in this article we will endeavor to show how those who \"m anufacture\" and \"control\" our m one y have used its profits to \"buy\" our politicians, and now control our Governm ent. POWER TO COIN AND REGULATE MONEY When we can see the disastrous results of an artificially created shortage of m oney, we can better understand why our Founding Fathers, who underst ood both m oney and God' s Laws, insisted on placing the power to \"create\" m oney and the power to control it ONLY in the hands of the Federal Governm ent. They believed that ALL citizens should share in the profits of its \"creation\" and therefore the national governm ent m ust be the ONL Y creator of m oney. They further believed that ALL Canadian citizens, regardless of station in life, would benefit by an adequate and stable currency and therefore the national governm ent m ust also be, by law, the ONLY controller of the value of m oney. Since the Federal Governm ent was the only legislative body subject to all the citizens at the ballot box, it was, to their m inds, the only safe depository of so m uch profit and so m uch power. They wrote it in sim ple language, \"The Federal Governm ent shall have the Power to Coin Money and Regulate the Value Thereof.\" HOW THE PEOPLE LOST CONTROL Instead of the Constitutional m ethod of creating our m oney and putting it into circulation, we now have an entirely unconstitutional system . This has resulted in alm ost disastrous conditions, as we shall see."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"A historical sketch of currency and banking in Cana da, tracing certain features of the central banking system that have finally led up to the establishment of the Bank of Canada appears on pages 900-905 of the 1938 Canada Year Book. In chronological order these are: 1. Central Note Issue, permanently established with the issue of Dominion Notes under legislation of 1868. 2. The Canadian Bankers' Association, established in 1900 and designed to effect greater co- operation amongst the banks in the issue of notes, in credit control and in various aspects of bank activities. 3. The Central Gold Reserves, established by the Bank Act of 1913. 4. Rediscount Facilities, originated as a war measure by the Finance Act of 1914, and made a permanent feature of this system by the Finance Act of 1923. This Act empowers the Minister of Finance to issue Dominion Notes to the banks on the deposit by them of approved securities, thus providing the banks with a means of increasing their legal tender cash reserve at will. I would like, at this point, to emphasize the last line of the above quotation: \"THUS PROVIDING THE BANKS WITH THE MEANS OF I NCREASING THEIR LEGAL TENDER CASH RESERVE AT WILL.\" This is a most astounding statement. What it says is that the banks can create their own reserves, and then issue BANK CREDIT MONEY against these reserves that they themselves have created. In other words, they now need no gold, no silver, not even paper money, but all they need are government securities (bonds) as reserve for CREDIT MONEY and furthermore, they can buy these reserves (bonds) with the CREDIT MONEY that they have created. Did someone once say you can't get something for nothing? Let him investigate our monetary system and I am sure he will change his mind! WE BORROW IT AND PAY THEM INTEREST We shall start with the need for money. The Federal Government, having spent more than it has taken from its citizens in taxes, needs, for the sake of illustration, $1,000,000,000 (1 BILLION DOLLARS). Since it does not have the money, because it has given away its authority to \"create\" it, the Government must go to the \"creators\" for the $1 billion. But, a private banking corporation doesn't just give its money away! The Bankers are willing to deliver $1,000,000,000 in money or credit to the Federal Government in exchange for the Government's agreement to pay it back - with interest! The government authorizes the Treasury Department to print $1,000,000,000 in Canadian bonds which are then delivered to the BANK OF CANADA. The BANK OF CANADA sells the BONDS to the privately owned banks. The privately owned banks pay for the bonds by creating a bank deposit of $1 billion on behalf of the federal government. This means that the private banks have created a billion dollars that did not exist before. This creation cost the private banks nothing except the cost of cancelling out the government cheques as the government spends the deposit by writing cheques against it. The private banks now own the billion dollars worth of bonds and at the present rate of 10 1/2% the FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TAXES THE PEOPLE OF CANADA year after year to pay the interest. The federal government has to date piled up a mountainous debt of $519,845,000,000 and the interest on this debt this year is $44,000,000,000+ or a per capita debt of $1,513. This means a family of four is taxed $6,052 a year just to pay the interest. "},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" BUT TH AT IS NOT ALL!!! THERE IS ALSO THE FRACTIONAL RESERVE SY STEM Under the fractional reserve system , the private banks can now take the GOVERNMENT BOND that they have bought by creating a deposit and use it as reserve to create m ore bank deposits. HOW MUCH CAN THEY CREATE? Under the 1967 Bank Act they could create 16 tim es the am ount of their reserve. On page 10 of the book called \"HOW THE CANADIAN MONEY SUPPLY IS AFFECTED BY VARIOUS BANKING AND FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS\", published by the Royal Bank of. Canada, they them selves show how this is done. Im agine what this m eans. It m eans that with one dollar of reserve with the BANK OF CANADA, the private banks can loan out $15 of cheque book m oney and collect 15% interest. This gives them $2.25 of interest on every dollar held in reserve. THIS IS STILL NOT ALL On Novem ber 19, 1980, Bill C-6 was passed in the Canadian House of Com mons, which gave a further concession to the private banks. W HEREAS, the 1967 BANK ACT required a reserve of $4 on notice deposits and 12% on dem and deposits, Bill C-6 reads as f ollows: • 208. (1) A bank shall m aintain a prim ary reserve in the form of: 1. coins with a face value of two dollars or less that are current under the Currency and Exchange Act, 2. Bank of Canada notes, or 3. deposits in Canadian currency with the Bank of Canada, and such reserve shall not be less on the average during the m onth than an am ount equal to the aggregate of 4. ten percent of such of its deposit liabilities as are Canadian currency dem and deposit liabilities, 5. two per cent of such of its deposit liabilities as are Canadian currency notice deposit liabilities."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"This reduction in reserves will enable the private banks to issue from 20 to 25 times their reserves rather than 16 times - the amount they could issue under the 1967 BANK ACT. This lowering of the reserves will mean that the banks can issue at least 25% more money than they were able to issue under the 1967 BANK ACT. This increase will be needed to replace the money withdrawn by ever-increasing interest, repayment of loans, and to make up for the extra money needed because of inflation. This of course will increase bank profits. Bankers and their government supporters will say that many of these criticisms of the reserve system are no longer valid because of 1991 changes to the Bank Act. However, the changes are for the worse! Perhaps the greatest tragedy that has happened to our country since the fourth edition of Billions for the Bankers - Debts for the People is the change in the new Bank Act. The private chartered banks have won a major battle. Under the 1967 Bank Act, the Minister of Finance had the power over the governor of the Bank of Canada to reduce or increase the fractional reserve of the private chartered banks, thereby increasing or reducing the money supply. Under Sec. 457 of December 1991, the Minister of Finance has lost this power by the elimination of the fractional reserve system. This is not all. Under Sec. 410 and Sec. 434 the private chartered banks are given the following additional powers: • Sec. 410 1. act as a custodian of property; and 2. act as receiver, liquidator or sequestrator • Sec. 434 (2) Nothing in any charter, Act or law shall be construed as ever having been intended to prevent or as preventing a bank from acquiring and holding an absolute title to and in any mortgaged or hypothecated real property, whatever the value thereof, or from exercising or acting on any power of sale contained in any mortgage given to or held by the bank, authorizing or enabling it to sell or convey any property so mortgaged. These changes in the Bank Act have given the banks a complete right over our money supply. And, unless this power is restored to Parliament and the Banks put on 100% reserve, all talk of democracy and sovereignty of Parliament is truly idle and futile. You may ask why the banks do not show more profits if it is such a lucrative business. Of course they do show tremendous profits year after year. They have been showing an increase of profits of anywhere from 20 to 35% for a number of years. But not all the profits of banks are reported. AS FAR BACK AS 1934 BANKS WERE HIDING RESERVES. The following excerpt is from the BANK AND COMMERCE COMMITTEE, APRIL 19. 1934. (BEFORE THEY WERE ON THEIR GUARD...)

Ilsley.\" \"The Edmonton Bulletin\" June 16, 1944 WHY IT IS CALLED \"INFLATABLE CURRENCY \" The only way new m oney goes into circulation in Canada under this wicked system is when som eone borrows it from a Banker. W hen people are confident of success they borrow m uch m oney, which increases the m oney supply, and all seem to prosper for a while. Then, as they pay off their loans, the available m oney supply shrinks rapidly, and m oney becom es \"scarce.\" Since they m ust always take m ore out of circulation that they put in (because of interest and other charges), only other people borrowing still m ore can keep a m edium of exchange available to the nation. An exam ple will aid our understanding. IF $40,000 IS BORROWED: $179,292 MUST BE PAID BACK When a citizen goes to a Banker to borrow $40,000 to purchase a hom e or a farm , the Banker' s clerk first requires the citizen to assign to the Banker the right of ownership of the property if the borrower is unable to m ake the paym ents. The Banker' s clerk then gives the borrower a $40,000 check, or he signs a $40,000 deposit slip crediting the borrower' s checking account with a $40,000 deposit. The borrower in turn writes the necessary checks to the builder, seller, subcontractors, etc. (who in turn write checks), thereby putting $40,000 of \"checkbook m oney\" into circulation. However, on a 30- year m ortgage with 15 1/4% interest, the Banker wants $498.97 a m onth paid to him self, or a total of $179,292. The buyer m ust take that $179,292 out of circulation, m aking the am ount in circulation $139,292 less than when he purchased the hom e (see illustration on inside cover page). The Banker has not produced anything of value (except the slip of paper called a check or deposit slip), yet he now has $139,292 m ore than he had before (m inus a few hundred dollars of clerical and office cost) and the people, as a whole, have $139,292 less. SMALL LOANS ARE DISASTROUS TOO For those who haven' t quite grasped the im pact of the above, let us consider a sm all auto loan for only 3 years. STEP 1: Citizen borrows $3,000 and pays it into circulation (it goes to the dealer, the factory, the miner, etc.) and signs a note agreeing to pay back to the Banker a total of $3,600. STEP 2: Citizen continues to work and pays $100 per m onth to the Banker. In 36 m onths, he has taken $3,600 out of circulation and paid it to the bank, where it rem ains until som eone else borrows it out again. Net result? $600 less m oney in circulation than before he m ade the loan. Since m oney requirem ents, as is well known, INCREASE with increased population and production, and paying off any loan DECREASES the average available m oney supply of m oney, it is obvious that we would quickly run out of m oney com pletely UNLESS MORE AND MORE PEOPLE BORROW MORE AND MORE MONEY TO KEEP MONEY IN CIRCULATION! ADD THEM ALL TOGETHER Multiply the above exam ples by hundreds of m illions of tim es in the last half century, and you can see why in that tim e Canada has gone from a prosperous, debt-free nation to a debt-ridden nation, where practically every hom e, farm . and business is m ortgaged to the Bankers, and our cars, furniture, and clothes are purchased with borrowed m oney. The interest to the Bankers on personal, local, Provincial and Federal debt totals m ore than the com bined earnings of the working population! "},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"THE COST TO THEM? PRACTICALLY NOTHING In the tens of m illions of transactions m ade each year like those above, little actual m oney changes hands, nor is it necessary that it do so. Up to 95% of all \"cash\" transactions in Canada are by check, so the Banker is perfectly safe in \"creating\" that so-called \"loan\" by writing the check or the deposit slip, not against actual m oney, but against YOUR PROMISE TO PAY IT BACK! The only cost to him is the paper, ink, and a few dollars in salaries and office cost to him for each transaction. It is \"check-kiting\" on an im mense scale! Here is how 95% of our m oney is created. The private banks create a bank deposit, against which the custom er can write checks. These checks m ove goods and services the sam e as dollar bills. The am ount of real m oney in February 1980 was $8,952,000,000 in dollar bills. The am ount of bank deposit check m oney was $ 135,345,000,000, and there was approxim ately 14 tim es as m uch checking m oney as there was real m oney (dollar bills). The charts give the exam ple of how bank deposits m ove goods in the sam e way as dollar bills. Here is what the illustration shows. On June 15th, Jones and Thom pson each borrowed $1,000 from the bank. The bank, you will notice, credited them each with a $1,000 deposit. On June 16th Jones bought a calf from Thom pson for $100 and on the sam e date Thom pson deposited the check to his account. You will notice that his bank account increased to $1,100 and Jones' decreased to $900. This m eans that the banks get this m oney for only the cost of issuing this credit and the bank' s expense of cancelling out the checks. They do not pay depositors a share of this interest as the Credit Unions do. This m eans a trem endous profit on the first use of this m oney. This benefit should go to the people of Canada rather than to the private banks."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":" FIGURE 1: Because the Interest cannot be paid, some of the Borrowers must lose their Collateral, namely, their Farms, Houses or Businesses THE CALLING OF LOANS OR TIGHT MONEY POLICY This section requires little need of explanation.

I don't believe there is any more damaging evidence available that the MONEY MONOPOLISTS were the culprits that were responsible for the Great Depression. Furthermore, it also clearly shows the power that these Financial Monopolists wield over the economy and therefore over the lives of the people. FOR THE GAMBLERS AMONG MY READERS To grasp the truth that periodic withdrawal of money through interest payments will inexorably transfer all wealth in a nation to the receiver of interest, imagine yourself in a poker or dice game where everyone must buy the chips (the medium of exchange) from a \"banker\" who does not risk chips in the games, but watches the table and every hour reaches in and takes 10% to 15% of all the chips on the table. As the game goes on, the amount of chips in the possession of each player will go up and down with his \"luck.\" However, the TOTAL number of chips available to play the game (carry on trade and business) will decrease rapidly. The game will get low on chips, and some will run out. If they want to continue to play, they must buy or borrow them from the \"banker.\" The \"banker\" will sell (lend) them ONLY if the player signs a \"mortgage\" agreeing to give the \"banker\" some real property (car, home, farm, business, etc.) if he cannot make periodic payments to pay back all of the chips plus some EXTRA ones (interest). The payments must be made on time, whether he wins (makes a profit) or not. It is easy to see that no matter how skillfully they play, eventually the \"banker\" will end up with all of his original chips back, and except for the very best players, the rest, if they stay in long enough, will lose to the \"banker\" their homes, their farms, their businesses, perhaps even their cars, watches, rings, and the shirts off their backs! Our real-life situation is MUCH WORSE than any poker game. In a poker game none is forced to go into debt, and anyone can quit at any time and keep whatever he still has. But in real life, even if we borrow little ourselves from the Bankers, the local, provincial and Federal governments borrow billions in our name, squander it, then confiscate our earnings from us and pay it back to the Bankers with interest. We are forced to play the game, and none can leave except by death. We pay as long as we live, and our children pay after we die. If we cannot pay, the same government sends the police to take our property and give it to the Bankers. The Bankers risk nothing in the game; they just collect their percentage and \"win it all.\" In Las Vegas and at other gambling centers, all games are \"rigged\" to pay the owner a percentage, and they rake in millions. But even in these places the rigged margins may be only 1 or 2%. Canada's monetary system \"game\" is also rigged, and it pays off in billions! How sorry of a state are we in when our government allows banks to rig their margins for the essentials of life at a rate ten times higher than gambling casinos! In recent years Bankers added real \"cards\" to their game. \"Credit\" cards are promoted as a convenience and a great boon to trade. Actually, they are ingenious devices by which Bankers collect 2% to 5% of every retail sale from the seller and 18% interest from the buyers. A real \"stacked\" deck. YES, IT'S POLITICAL, TOO! The Liberal, Conservative, and N.D.P. voters who have wondered why politicians always spend more tax money than they take in should now see the reason. When they begin to study our \"debt- money\" system, they soon realize that these politicians are not the agents of the people but the agents"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"of the Bankers, for whom they plan ways to place the people further in debt. It takes only a little im agination to see that if Governm ent had been \"c reating\" and spending or issuing into circulation the necessary increase in the m oney supply, THERE W OULD BE NO NATIONAL DEBT, and the $500 billion of other debts would be practically non-existent. Since there would be no ORIGINAL cost of m oney except printing, and no CONTINUING costs such as interest, Federal taxes would be alm ost nil.

Our two large political parties have becom e its servants, the various departm ents of governm ent its spending agencies, and Revenue Canada its collection agency. "},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":" THE SOLUTION 1. In order to solve the problem, the government must take back the right they have given the private banks to issue the country's money supply. The benefits of this one reform would be tremendous. Money could be put into circul ation DEBT AND INTEREST FREE. This would mean that the government could pay back its debt and save the people $40,000,000,000+ in interest payments, therefore $40,000,000,000+ in taxes. Furthermore, every time the G.N.P. would increase, the government could issue new money to the amount of the increase of goods and services. This means that many of the government services could be provided without taxation. The reduction in taxes would not only stop inflation, but reverse it. 2. Putting the banks on a 100% reserve would stop the private banks from creating money. What is more, the banks would have to cash in their bonds as their reserves would be increased. This would reduce the national debt tremendously without it costing the government a single dollar, because the government would pay for the bonds with money that cost the Bank of Canada nothing except the cost of printing. THOMAS EDISON said, \"It is absurd to say our Country can issue bonds and cannot issue currency. Both are promises to pay, but one fattens the usurer and the other helps the People . If the currency issued by the People were no good, then the bonds would be no good either.\" The money issued to the federal government can be put into circulation in a number of ways. One of the first should be to pay off the national debt and save our $40+ billion in interest charges which can not be solved with increased taxes and massive program cuts. This money would reduce government expenditure and the government could then balance its budget. Secondly, the money could be spent into circula tion by giving government services without taxation. For example, if the money spent on building schools, hospitals, and government buildings, and on providing pensions and family allowances were spent into circulation rather than borrowed by the government, it would stay in circulation, until it was worn out and then it could be replaced at a very small expense. Today, however, money is borrowed into circulation and is withdrawn at 15% in less than 5 years, and at 18% In 4 years, leaving the principal of the loan unpaid to be compounded. This exaggerates the problem year by year. If, however, the money were spent into circulation, the people receiving this would own it and when they used it to buy the necessities of life. the money would keep circulating. In a very few years, the money in circulation would all be debt and interest free. Once the governments, the corporations, and small businesses, as well as individuals, would all be free of debt, the saving to the people would be at least $230 billion per year in interest (present debt x 8%). This is not a dream but can become a reality, if YOU, the people, take action. What is fooling so many well-meaning people is that they have been led to believe that they are doing well under this system. This is an illusion which looks good when they are earning interest on a safe investment like government bonds. "},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":" However, once you rem ove the cost of inflation and taxes from their gain, the picture doesn' t look so good. For exam ple: Assets in Gov' t Bonds ---------------------------- 100,000 Earned Interest Incom e at 12% -------------------- 12,000 Total Assets -------------------------------------- 112,000 11% Inflation Lo ss on Total ------------------------ 12,320 Value of Asset Afte r Inflation ---------------------- 99,680 Incom e Tax on $12,000 (exem pt $1,000) ----------- 2,755 Your Assets will now only be worth ---------------- 96,925 The Results: The Same as Earning NO Interest and a loss of $3,075. People m ay think this is an unrealistic picture because the rate of inflation, at any particular m oment, may be lower than 11%. Of course, if this were so, the interest rates would be m uch lower as well. At any rate, the erosion of taxes brought about by th e governm ent's need to pay interest on their debt will alm ost certainly continue to grow. Let us now summariz e the evils of our present monetary system. The evil is that interest is charged at the origin of m oney. This is caused by our federal governm ent giving away the right to issue and put into circulation our total m oney supply. It has given this right to the private chartered banks. Under this system all m oney now com es into circulation as a debt to the private banks. The private banks charge interest on this m oney. This interest becom es an additional debt above the principal we borrow. This addition cannot be paid because no m oney is issued to pay it. If you borrow this addition you go deeper into debt. If you pay the interest out of the principal, this reduces the m oney you borrowed and the debt cannot be repaid."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Furthermore, it reduces the money supply and causes a depression. In both cases we pile up mountains of debt that cannot be paid. The interest on these mountains of debt is now so large and ever-increasing because of compounding that it is causing ever-increasing inflation because the interest has to be passed on to the consumer. Those that have the power to pass this interest cost on to the consumer not only cause inflation but force the consumer to go into debt, because with the added interest costs there is not enough money left in circulation to buy all the goods and services available. Let me give you a short but simple example. You borrow $1,000. at 15%. At the end of the year the banker wants back $1,000. plus $150. for interest. However, the $150. for interest doesn't exist. The banker only created a $1,000. but he wants back more than he loaned you. There is a flaw in our monetary system and this is why it will not work. So here is what happens. You pay your principal of $1,000. which leaves you the interest debt of $150. Because there is no money with which to pay it, you start your second year borrowing a new $1,000. Now you owe $1,150. and at 15%, by the end of the second year you owe $1,322.50. You again pay your principal. But you now owe $322.50. This is COMPOUNDING INTEREST. But your friendly banker will continue to loan you money as long as you have unmortgaged collateral, that is, a factory, a farm, a house, etc., etc. But this increased borrowing and paying interest has now become a part of your business. And in order for you to continue, you must pass this extra cost on to the consumer, your worker. So you raise the price of your merchandise, AND LOW AND BEHOLD! INFLATION IS BORN!!! But now, because you have increased the price of your merchandise, your workers need more money if they are to buy the goods they have helped produce. Of course, this is only the beginning of the problem. As your debt and interest increases year by year, you are forced to keep raising prices. By this time your worker is convinced that you are the one cr eating inflation. So he has to respond by demanding a yearly increase in wages. This has created enmity between business and labour, each blaming the other for the cause of inflation. However, the banker is the prime mover in creating inflation because he has put a cost on the use of money (namely interest). It was this interest which forced you to increase the price of your merchandise. Labour increase in wages was secondary. And the continuing increase in your debt and interest is continuing to create INFLATION. COMPOUND INTEREST The biggest EVIL about interest is that it cannot be paid. Therefore it is COMPOUNDED. Let me give an example of the differen ce of COMPOUND INTEREST and SIMPLE INTEREST. $1.00 loaned out at the time of the birth of Christ at 3% COMPOUND INTEREST would be $19,342,814,713,834,066,795,298,816 SIMPLE INTEREST would be $59. $1.00 loaned out at the same time at 6% - COMPOUND INTEREST would be $2,075,564.540,495,770,000,659,356,622,933,159,968,008,080,198,784. SIMPLE INTEREST would be $118."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"DESTROY ANYONE SUGGESTING GOVERNMENT (CITIZENS') MONEY BE WITHOUT INTEREST AND WITHOUT DEBT History tells us of debt-free and interest-free m oney issued by governments. The American colonies did it in the 1700's and their wealth soon rivalled E ngland and brought restrictions from Parliament, which led to the Revolutionary War. Abraham Lincoln did it in 1863 to help finance the Civil War. He was later assassinated. No debt-free or interest-free money has been issued in America since then. Several Arab nations issue interest-free loans to their citizens today. The Saracen Empire forbad interest on money for 1,000 years, and its wealth outshone even Saxon Europe. Mandarin China issued its own money, interest-free and debt-free, and the European traveller, Marco Polo, was astounded by the wealth and civilization of the Mandarin Empire. Germany issued debt-free and interest-free mone y from 1935 and on, accounting for its startling rise from the depression to a world power in 5 years. Germany financed its entire government and war operation from 1935 to 1945 without gold and without debt, and it took the whole Capitalist and Communist world to destroy the German power over Europe that was built by this money system. So much of what the Nazis did had to be stopped. However, the destruction of the Nazi menace was also a convenient opportunity to repudiate all of their policies - including the success of their money supply - and thereafter bring Europe back under the heel of the Bankers. Of course, how a country spends its created money (such as on the ills of war) should not take away from the power and usefulness of this system of money supply. However, this history of money does not even appear in the textbooks of public (government) schools today. By the issuance of money and credit in the above manner the nation's total money supply can be increased to meet the nation's needs with no disadvantage to anyone and with advantage to all. All will benefit from the increased ease of exchanging goods and services with more money available. THE IMPORTANT THING IS THAT THE MONEY DOES NOT HAVE TO BE TAXED OR TAKEN OUT OF CIRCULATION TO PAY BACK TO THE PARASITIC BANKERS. As stated before, it would remain in circulation for generations at no cost to the citizens, except for printing replacements for paper currency as it wears out. STABLE MONEY Money, issued in such a way, would derive its value in exchange from the fact that it had come from the highest legal source in the nation and would be declared to be legal to pay all public and private debts. Issued by a sovereign nation, not in danger of collapse, it would need no gold or silver or other so-called \"precious\" metals to back it. As history shows, the stability and responsibility of the government issuing it is the deciding factor in the acceptance of that government's currency - not gold, silver, or iron buried in some hole in the ground. Proof is Canada's currency today. Our gold and silver are practically gone, but our currency is accepted. But if the government was about to collapse, our currency would be worthless. Also, money issued through the peoples' legitimate government would not be under the control of a privately owned corporation whose individual owners benefit by causing the money amount and value to fluctuate and the people to go into debt. Under the present debt-usury system,' the extra burden of usury forces workers and businesses to demand more money for the work and goods to pay their ever-increasing debts and taxes. Since it is a demand for more dollars for the same work or goods, it is a DEFLATION of the dollar (erroneously called \"inflation\" by the money propa gandists). Today deflation of money value is totally to the benefit of the money-lenders, since it wipes out savings of one generation, so they"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"cannot finance or help the next generation, forcing them to borrow from the m oney-lender and pay him for three houses in order to get one.

It m ay be called a fable, but it is true in its portrayal of how our present m onetary system evolved. A certain rich m an wanted to go abroad for a two-year vacation. He owned in cash ten thousand shekels of gold. He could not take the gold with him because of its weight and the danger of being robbed; so he went to a goldsm ith to ask whether he could leave his gold with him for safekeeping. The goldsm ith, who had a large security vault, wanted to be paid to keep the rich m an's gold. He asked for 10% - or 1,000 shekels. The rich m an readily agreed to deposit his gold with the goldsm ith and left on his trip abroad. As soon as the rich m an had left his gold and depart ed, the goldsm ith told his helper to go and spread the word that his m aster had a few shekels of gold to loan to financially secure custom ers at 15% interest. Soon the borrowers cam e. One wanted fifty shekels, another one hundred, etc. In all cases the goldsm ith wanted collateral as security. If the borrower defaulted, he would lose his collateral such as a house, a farm or business."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"However, to the goldsmith's surprise most of the borrowers did not take delivery of the gold. Instead, all they wanted was the goldsmith's receipt saying \"I owe you x number of gold shekels\" which could be used to claim the gold when they wanted it. In modem terms they had what we call a demand deposit. As the days proceeded, the goldsmith had loaned out his 1,000 shekels which were drawing 15% interest. Yet to the goldsmith's surprise nearly all the shekels were still in his vault. The only people who took their gold were a few of the small bo rrowers. The others wanted only receipts (lOUs) showing that the goldsmith held their gold and that they could have it when they needed it. As time went on, the goldsmith found that the people were accepting his receipts (lOUs) in payment of goods and services rather than using the gold. When the occasional person did claim his gold and used it for the payment of goods, etc., the one who received the gold brought it back to the goldsmith for safekeeping and accepted an IOU. This gave the goldsmith a terrific idea. If only the occasional person wanted the gold, and even then most of it would come back in a deposit, he could loan out the rich man's 9,000 shekels and collect interest on them for the next two years, as well as loan out his own 1,000 shekels and collect interest on them. Even if the rich man should come back sooner than expected, the goldsmith could pay him his 9,000 shekels, and the people who were using the goldsmith's lOUs and paying him interest would not even know the gold was no longer there. So he proceeded to loan out the rich man's shekels and to his delight nearly all the rich man's gold stayed in his vault as did his own 1,000 shekels. In other words, the people were satisfied to use the goldsmith's lOUs as a medium of exchange believing that the gold was there if they wanted it. When the rich man did return, the goldsmith paid him his 9,000 shekels. The 1,000 shekels of his own was enough to pay the occasional person who wanted gold, and he found that even most of that came back to him as a deposit for safekeeping. So now he was collecting interest of $1,500 on 10,000 shekels every year when he had only 1,000 shekels, or 10%, in reserve. (continued on next page) After a time, when the goldsmith was convinced that his customers did not want what he owed them, namely gold, except in rare cases, but that they were willing to pay him interest on his lOUs, which were supposed to represent gold, this gave th e goldsmith a brilliant idea. He thought that if the people are willing to pay him interest on the money he owes them, namely, on his paper receipts (his lOUs), he could become the richest man in the entire world. This was too good to be true. Sooner or later so me smart fellow would find out what he was doing and tell the king. And once the king would realize that he could issue his own paper receipts (lOUs) to pay for his government's expenditures, he may even go so far as to issue enough receipts to supply the whole economy. If this were to happen the goldsmith knew his profitable game would be over. So the goldsmith set out to find the wisest man in the village and told him his story of how he could become the richest man in the world if only there were some way that he could get a monopoly on the storing of gold as a reserve and on the issuing of paper receipts (lOUs, or in other words, paper money) and the loaning of them for the purpose of collecting interest. The wise man said, \"You know, that may just be possible while the king is still ignorant about money matters. The king like everyone else runs short of money. When he does and he comes to you to borrow money, you ask the king to give you, as the goldsmith, the exclusive right to issue paper receipts (your lOUs) against"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"gold reserves. However, it may be wise for you to include the rest of the goldsmiths in your scheme. With their support the extent of your profits and power will be unlimited. Once you and the other goldsmiths have the exclusive right to issue all the paper receipts against the gold reserves, then your lOUs will become paper money.\" The wise man warned, \"Never issue interest free paper money with which people can pay their interest. They must pay the interest with GOLD. Th is will soon put all the gold into the hands of the goldsmiths. Then no one, not even the king, can issue paper money, simply because he will have no gold to use as reserves. Furthermore, once the people have used all their gold to pay interest, they will have no choice but to pay the interest with the principal of paper money they borrowed from you, or to borrow the money to pay the interest. Therefore, you (the goldsmiths) must be sure never to pay your expenses, nor build new buildings with newly created money, because money spent into circulation will be interest free and could be used by your borrowers to pay their interest. This would make the system work without creating a shortage of money. However, if no interest free money gets into circulation, then your customers have no choice; they must pay you the interest using some of the principal they borrowed, or borrow the money with which to pay the interest. THIS IS COMPOUNDING . In either case a shortage of money will continue to be created because the payment of interest will reduce the money supply and will force the people, the businesses, and finally the government into a debt they cannot pay. This will mean you can foreclose on the collateral (houses, farms, or factories) of individuals and businesses and you will have control not only of all their money but of their property as well. The government will become nothing but a tax collecting agency with the purpose of levying taxes on the people to pay you interest on the government debt. Finally, you can get control of even the government. The government must do your bidding, and your system will be secure. The government will be acting on your behalf rather than on behalf of the people.\" The goldsmith said, \"Oh my, oh my, oh my, you are a wise man. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Should you ever be in need of money, just come to me and I will repay you well.\" Here the fable ends. Whether the goldsmiths acted on the advice of the wise man or on their own initiative matters little. The fact remains that this evolved into our present banking system. The evil of not being able to pay both debt and interest is still with us, and has now grown into a MONSTER threatening to destroy our economy and our country. Once the goldsmiths had the exclusive right to issue all paper money (lOUs) against gold reserves, our modern banking system came into existence. The 1965 Encyclopedia International under \"Money and Monetary Systems\" says: The goldsmiths learned from experience that although their notes were payable on demand, in practice not every noteholder came in to ask for redemption at once. As a result, the goldsmiths always had a stock of metal on hand. Taking advantage of this fact, they wrote extra notes to borrowers. The goldsmiths thus created money by writing notes against which they had only a fractional reserve. Thus began the banking business, and for a long time anyone could become a banker just as easily as he could be a grocer or a barber. The large banks, however, were government-chartered. The earliest ones include the Bank of Sweden (1656) the Bank of England (1694), and the Royal Bank of France (1716-20). They issued bank notes just as the goldsmiths did, and these printed notes circulated nationally, like today's paper currency.

He called it prim ing of the econom ic pum p to get the econom y rolling again. Irving Fisher, an econom ics professor at Yale University, also wrote a book about the sam e tim e called 100% Money . In this book he advocated that the governm ent should issue our m oney rather than let the banks create the m oney and have the governm ent borrow it and pay interest on it as Keynes proposed. This is so im portant, let m e repeat it. Fisher advocated that the governm ent should issue the m oney, thereby creating neither debt nor the burdensom e interest which m ust be paid through taxation. Had we followed Fisher rather than Keynes, Canadians would be in clover today."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Irving Fisher was not the only one at the time advocating that the government issue our money supply. Government issuance of the money supply was also advocated by the Chicago Group of economists. This group was comprised of Professors Harvey Simons, Lloyd Mints, A.G. Hart, Frank Knight, Garfield Cox, Henry Schultz and Paul H. Douglas. There are so many economists, businessmen and even former bankers in the U.S.A. now supporting this view that space does not permit the publishing of all their names. There is one more outstanding economist who has backed monetary reform. It is Nobel Prize winner Milton Friedman. He wrote a book in 1960 called, A Program for Monetary Stability . On page 65 he stated that he was in favor of what Henry Si mons and Lloyd Mints were advocating, that is, 100% reserve. In other words, he advocated that governments, rather than private banks, issue the money supply. We also have some outstanding Canadians advocating the same. John Hotson, Professor of Economics, University of Waterloo, Professor Gordon Borham of the University of Ottawa, ( Economic Thinking in a Canadian Context , page 589), and Professor Warren Blackman of Calgary University. THE NEED FOR ELECTORIAL & PARLIAMENTARY REFORM You may have wondered why the people of Canada ha ve not done anything to change this financial dictatorship. The reason is quite simple. The establishment has made you believe that we have a democratic form of government, when in reality we have not only a financial dictatorship but a political dictatorship as well. Every four or five years we have an election. From the time the writ is issued until you have elected a party to power you have the democratic right to vote for the party of your choice. But, as soon as you have elected a government, and it does not matter which party is elected, you have a dictatorship until the next election. Here is why. In our so-called democracy, the people of the different parties elect their leader. When the party gets elected, the leader of the party becomes the Prime Minister and has the right to choose his cabinet. The cabinet is in reality the government. The Prime Minister can fire any cabinet minister which he himself has chosen if the cabin et minister does not agree with him. This makes him a dictator, no less so than Hitler, Mussolini or Stalin, for that term of government. If you do not like the dictator you have, you can elect a new dictator in the next election, because no matter which party you elect, the leader of the party then becomes a dictator. If we want true democracy, this must be changed. The power to choose the cabinet must be taken out of the Prime Minister's hands and put into the hands of parliament, namely, the elected members of parliament. In a city government, the mayor is not a dictator because the council decides who the different committee members shall be. With such a change a situation such as Prime Minister Mulroney firing his cabinet minister because he voted against the language bill. Bill 72, could not happen, unless the majority of the elected members agreed. Then you will have True Democracy. PARLIAMENTARY REFORM The duration of a parliament will be clearly defined and general elections for its renewal will be held on a fixed date, unless a majority of the Members of Parliament express non-confidence in a specific vote on the credibility of the government."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":" Mem bers of Parliam ent would thus be free to vote on bills according to their conscience and constituents because their vote would not threaten the future of the governm ent.
