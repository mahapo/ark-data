[{"pageContent":"undefined"},{"pageContent":"INTRODUCTIONEvery Spring since 1954 an elite group of around one hundred of the world’s mostpowerful politicians, businessmen, bankers, media executives, and internationalroyalty have been quietly gathering for a secret meeting in an evacuatedfive-star hotel while being protected by armed guards who stand watch. Inside,for three days, the attendees engage in lengthy off-the-record talks about thetop issues facing the world. They’re called the Bilderberg Group, or often just“Bilderberg” for short, and for over a half century there wasn’t much more thana peep about the meeting in the American mainstream media.For decades, many people believed this meeting was an urban legend, but as youwill soon see, it is very real and very well documented. Rumors about theBilderberg Group do seem like something out of a Hollywood movie with the clichéclaims of a “secret meeting” of a group of wealthy men trying to “take over theworld,” but “as crazy as it sounds,” in recent years a lot of allegations aboutthe Bilderberg Group that had floated around on the Internet began to surface insome mainstream publications. To many people’s surprise, such a meeting exists,and the “rumors” were true.Between 100 to 120 of the world’s top politicians, businessmen, financial fatcats, military leaders, heads of intelligence agencies, reporters, andexecutives from major media outlets fly half way around the world to gather oncea year in the end of May or early June in a closed down fancy hotel for threedays and are protected by private security contractors and local police whostand watch outside to prevent any uninvited guests from dropping by. Temporarysecurity fences are even set up to prevent anyone from stepping foot on theproperty, and attempt to block the view from any onlookers who are watching fromacross the street to see who shows up.The attendees arrive one after the other in tinted Lincoln Town Cars driven byprofessional drivers. Independent journalists and photographers have been ableto discover the time and place for many of these meetings in recent years andhave gotten clear photographs of some of the men and women who have attended,but most still refuse to even acknowledge they know anything about it.Some people refer to them as “the 1%” but this label is far from accurate if youdo the math. One percent of the earth’s seven billion people is 70 millionpeople! Bilderberg is more like the .00001% which is approximately 700 people, afigure that accounts for the steering committee and the regular attendees overthe past few decades.The meeting is named after the Bilderberg Hotel located in Oosterbeck, Holland,which was the site of their first gathering organized by Prince Bernhard of theNetherlands in 1954. Then, and still today, attendees agree not to discusspublicly who was in attendance or what specifically was discussed, and (untilrecently at least) most of them have denied any knowledge of the BilderbergGroup at all when—on the rare occasion—someone asked them about it—usually acitizen journalist or YouTuber.For decades, news of the shadowy Bilderberg Group spread in so-called“anti-government” Patriot circles, in underground newsletters, and “conspiracy”websites, until the advent of YouTube and social media finally forced some majormainstream media outlets to admit that Bilderberg is real and some very powerfulpeople attend. After these decades of news blackouts, with the rise of socialmedia and video sharing sites like YouTube, slowly more and more major newsoutlets have begun to at least mention the Bilderberg Group, albeit ever sobriefly, and usually including the caveat that “conspiracy theorists” are upsetor “paranoid” about them. Through the increase in popularity of alternative newswebsites and the emergence of social media, more and more people began learningabout this strange and secretive meeting, and it got to a point where mainstreamoutlets basically had to at least mention it was happening in attempts to avoidlooking like they were covering it up by purposefully avoiding the issue.1[part0013.html#footnote1]For years, if anyone called into any of the major syndicated talk radio showslike Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Glenn Beck and others, and told the callscreener they wanted to ask about the Bilderberg Group, that person’s call wouldnever be put through. “We’re not taking calls on that right now, sorry. Click.”If the person calling gave the call screener a bogus question and happened to beput on air and then asked the host about the Bilderbergers, they would beridiculed and the call would be dropped immediately (something that’s happenedto me many times).2 [part0013.html#footnote2]Why not take it seriously? Why pretend for so many years they don’t exist? Arethese radio talk show hosts and other major news editors and reporters “in onit?” Has there been a “conspiracy” to keep the meeting out of the press? It’sfoolish to deny that there hasn’t been an arrangement between the BilderbergGroup and the American mainstream media to keep them out of the news and to havethe top political analysts and talk show hosts pretend like they don’t knowanything about them all these years. When 100 of the world’s most influentialpoliticians, media owners, banking executives, and business elite fly half wayaround the world to meet for three days in a closed down luxury hotel that’sfenced off and surrounded by armed guards, nobody can say that’s not anewsworthy or interesting event!Critics see this small, tightly knit group as an Aristocracy or an Oligarchy,comprised of men (and some women) who see themselves as having the right to rulebecause of their wealth and “superior intelligence” who put their own interestsabove anyone else’s—with little to no regard for the consequences. Without theproper checks and balances put in place, which was the intention of the FoundingFathers when they split the government into three different branches (Executive,Judicial, and Legislative) in what’s called the separation of powers, agovernment can become so powerful it is difficult to oppose them when theiractions are unfair or illegal. And when their discussions aren’t open to publicscrutiny it makes keeping them in check even more difficult.Many people believe that this meeting is possibly a violation of the Logan Act,which prohibits unauthorized citizens from negotiating with foreign governments,a law that was implemented to prevent people from interfering with internationalrelations between the United States and other countries. It specifically states,“Any citizen of the United States, wherever he may be, who, without authority ofthe United States, directly or indirectly commences or carries on anycorrespondence or intercourse with any foreign government or any officer oragent thereof, with intent to influence the measures or conduct of any foreigngovernment or of any officer or agent thereof, in relation to any disputes orcontroversies with the United States, or to defeat the measures of the UnitedStates, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years,or both.”Is the Bilderberg Group negotiating foreign policy? Is this where the rulingelite come to a consensus to guide the direction of the world in their favor? Oris it simply “just another conference?” Or, are the “conspiracy theorists”right? What is the evidence? How were they first discovered? What are theydoing? And should the public be concerned? Do they choose who the next presidentof the United States will be? Do they covertly coordinate economic booms andbusts?Do they manipulate foreign policy and decide which wars will be launched andwhen from behind these closed doors? Is this annual meeting of the power elitereally just not interesting or newsworthy? Has there been a cover-up or aconspiracy to keep them out of the headlines? Why the secrecy and the denialsfor so many years? Is this the “shadow government?” Those questions and morewill be answered in The Bilderberg Group: Facts & Fiction."},{"pageContent":"image.png [../images/00001.jpeg]The Marriott hotel in Chantilly, Virginia protected by a temporary privacy andsecurity fence set up for the 2012 meeting.image-1.png [../images/00002.jpeg] protesters trying to identify the attendees as they arrive for the 2012 meetingin Chantilly, Virginia."},{"pageContent":"THE ATTENDEESEach year the list of attendees reads like a who’s who of the ruling class.

Executives from the top televisionnetworks like News Corp CEO Rupert Murdoch and representatives from ABC, NBC,and CBS are also key fixtures, as well as popular political commentators andreporters.Top military brass and U.S. intelligence figures like David Petraeus (formerhead of the CIA), General Michael Haden (former NSA chief), General KeithAlexander (current head of the NSA);6 [part0013.html#footnote6] Donald Rumsfeld,former Secretary of Defense and one of the architects of the Iraq War; GeneralColin Powell; NATO’s Secretary General, the head of Britain’s Secret Service;and others are also regular attendees.Top American politicians like Secretary of State John Kerry, Senators JohnEdwards, Tom Daschele, Chuck Hagel, Hillary Clinton have all attended; as wellas members of British Parliament and European royalty. Even Presidents Clintonand Ford (before they were elected). No seated president ever attends becausetheir schedule and whereabouts is so closely monitored they couldn’t riskbrining so much attention to the event.Could all these globalist movers and shakers be getting together just to havecoffee and hang out? Or, as many believe, could this think tank be a place wherean elite consensus is arrived about how to best maintain and expand their powerand influence?The British newspaper The Observer (sister paper to The Guardian) surprisinglyran an article back in 1963 that remarked, “These people [Bilderbergers]maintain that the future belongs to technocrats, because the rumor among them isthat the grave questions of international affairs are too delicate to be left inthe hands of diplomats. However, the ‘clandestiny’ of their debates shows thatthey only seek one thing: effective domination over the peoples of the world,but by dissimulating [concealing] themselves and by leaving the responsibilityof the governments in the hands of petty politicians.”7[part0013.html#footnote7] image-2.png [../images/00003.jpeg] Protesters trying to get a photo of who is arriving in the back of this tintedlincoln town car at 2012 bilderberg meeting. "},{"pageContent":"RECENT MEETINGSThe conference is held in various countries throughout Europe at luxury hotelsand usually every fourth year it returns to the United States—on election years,which is no coincidence—often meeting in Chantilly, Virginia which is just ashort drive outside Washington D.C. This makes it convenient for politicians andthe Eastern Establishment in New York City to attend without drawing too muchsuspicion since they don’t have to leave the country and create a cover storyfor their prolonged absence.The entire hotel is cleared out around noon the day before the meeting and noreservations are accepted during this time so only Bilderberg members and guestsare allowed in the hotel. Actually—to be more specific—only members and guestsare allowed on the property since barricades and temporary fences are set up andlocal police and private security teams patrol the perimeter and guard theentrances.The hotels which are chosen are secluded on large plots of land, and neverdowntown in a major city. This makes it easier for members and guests to arrivewithout being identified. If the meeting were held at a hotel in downtownManhattan for example, onlookers could easily hang out on the side walk oracross the street to catch a glimpse (or take photos or video) of the attendeescoming or going. It is for this reason the location is always at a resort-stylehotel with plenty of land, hidden away from nearby streets and neighboringbuildings.The hotel staff is also sworn to secrecy and may likely be coerced into signingnon-disclosure agreements to prevent them from talking to the press (and theprotesters). When I was at the Marriott in Chantilly, Virginia the day before itwas cleared out for the 2012 Bilderberg meeting, I asked the bar tender if heknew what was about to happen over the next few days and he said he couldn’ttalk about it.There is a core group of regulars, many of whom have been involved for decades.A steering committee decides who is invited and what topics will be disguised.Each day’s meeting is broken up into two sessions in the morning and twosessions in the afternoon, except the final day which only has the two morningsessions.

These gumshoe super state architects and monetaryschemers were drawn from all NATO countries. The fact of this weird conclave asspooky as any midnight meeting of the Ku Klux Klan in a piney woods, was boundto get known to the world eventually.”8 [part0013.html#footnote8]He continued to explain how he first learned of this meeting, saying, “I got myfirst word of it from a reader who happened onto St. Simon Island, Brunswick,[Georgia] on her way to West Palm Beach. She wrote that the hotel on St. Simonwas almost deserted, but that when she commented on this, the clerk said theplace had been alive with mysterious characters a few days earlier and withSecret Service and FBI too.”While not yet knowing their name, Westbrook did see similarities between thismeeting and the secret Jekyll Island meeting that was held in 1910 by a smallgroup of America’s elite where they discussed and drew up plans for the FederalReserve Banking System. He said, “Senator Aldrich of Rhode Island, called thisone into being. He was the father of Winthrop Aldrich. There have been manyexcited versions of that ancient hoe-down on Jekyll Island, but relatively fewhave ever heard of it all.”After he began criticizing executives of the powerful Hearst Corporation, whichowned and controlled almost 30 different newspapers in America at the time, hewas fired. Hearst newspapers literally created “yellow journalism” which refersto sensationalistic headlines and careless reporting with a disregard for thefacts in order to sell more newspapers, something that has pretty much becomestandard practice in American mainstream media.A man named Willis Carto read Westbrook Pegler’s article about this intriguingmeeting and it inspired him to begin investigating the issue himself. A yearafter Westbrook Pegler’s article came out, Willis Carto began publishing anewsletter called Liberty Lowdown and would later begin publishing a newspapercalled The Spotlight which was largely dedicated to tracking and exposing thiselusive group.Over two decades later, a reporter named Jim Ticker would learn of theBilderberg Group when going to work for The Spotlight. Tucker immediately becameobsessed with them, and would later become the world’s foremost expert on themeeting. Tucker explained, “Had it not been for Willis A. Cato, who hired me aseditor of The Spotlight and then put me on the tack of Bilderberg, I wouldprobably—almost assuredly—never heard of the word ‘Bilderberg.’ Having had theopportunity, through Carto’s good offices as founder of Liberty Lobby, publisherof The Spotlight, to begin what ultimately proved to be a generation ofworld-wide Bilderberg-hunting, I was able to bring news about Bilderberg toliterally millions of folks who would like myself have otherwise remained in thedark about these globalist schemers.”9 [part0013.html#footnote9]Tucker had somehow gained the support of an insider who would leak informationto him every year about the location and date of the meeting, as well asattendee lists and other details. Tucker obsessively tracked the BilderbergGroup from 1975 until his death in 2013 at the age of 78. His book, titled JimTucker’s Bilderberg Diary contains decades of information about where theBilderbergers met, who was in attendance, and what was discussed.10[part0013.html#footnote10]As Tucker’s health began to fail, he turned over his trusted source (or sources)who tipped him off each year as to the meeting’s location and dates, to AlexJones from Infowars.com. Love him or hate him, Alex Jones played a large role ingetting major media to finally cover the Bilderberg Group meetings in the early2000’s. In 2006 he traveled to Ottawa, Canada after being tipped off that waswhere they were going to meet, and Alex Jones has announced the location everyyear since and has been able to get a growing number of supporters (expandingfrom a few hundred in 201211 [part0013.html#footnote11] to over 2000 inHertfordshire, England in 2014) to meet outside the hotel to peacefully protestand raise awareness about the meetings.12 [part0013.html#footnote12]With Alex’s huge audience and massively popular website, it became impossiblefor the Bilderberg Group to hide anymore, and now in the last few years theyquietly admit when and where they are meeting through their simple websiteBilderbergMeetings.org.

From the decadesof leaked documents and insider revelations it appears that the birth of newlegislation, economic booms and busts, and even the start of new wars andmilitary actions around the globe are often traced back to Bilderberg.One of their primary goals has been to form a New World Order global government,and over the last sixty years they have made tremendous progress with most oftheir plans already accomplished. In today’s information age with popularindependent media outlets and social media keeping an eye on the BilderbergGroup, it’s almost impossible now for them to stay a secret, but the decades ofdenials and media blackouts prove they have been deceptive from the start. Nowthat they are getting fairly well known, the denials and tactics of playing dumbhave changed into trying to pass themselves off as an ordinary businessconference like the G8, G20, or the Davos World Economic Forum.David Rothkopf, the managing director of Kissinger and Associates, aninternational advising firm founded by the infamous Henry Kissinger, wrote avery interesting book in 2009 titled Superclass: The Global Power Elite and theWorld They are Making, where he discussed the ruling elite and the variousorganizations that largely influence the political and economic landscape of theworld. While not revealing any earth shattering insider secrets, Rothkopf doesconfirm some of the persistent allegations made about the ruling class byso-called “conspiracy theorists.”He wrote, “A global elite has emerged over the past several decades that hasvastly more power than any other group on the planet. Each of the members of thesuperclass has the ability to regularly influence the lives of millions ofpeople in multiple countries worldwide. Each actively exercises this power, andthey often amplify it through the development of relationships with others inthis class.”46 [part0013.html#footnote46]He continues, “That such a group exists is indisputable. Heads of state, CEOs ofthe world’s largest companies, media barons, billionaires who are activelyinvolved in their investments, technology, entrepreneur, oil potentates, hedgefund managers, private equity investors, top military commanders, a select fewreligious leaders, a handful of renowned writers, scientists, and artists, eventerrorist leaders and master criminals, meet the above criteria formembership.”47 [part0013.html#footnote47]“In fact, [the Bilderberg Group, Trilateral Commission, and the World EconomicForum] are an important part of the story of the superclass.

I have objected, both in thepast and recently, to a few of its policies (notably to its belief that Englandwas an Atlantic rather than a European Power and must be allied, or evenfederated, with the United States and must remain isolated from Europe), but ingeneral my chief difference of opinion is that it wishes to remain unknown, andI believe its role in history is significant enough to be known.”59[part0013.html#footnote59]Regarding the Federal Reserve and the financial domination by a handful ofinternational banks, he said, “The powers of financial capitalism had afar-reaching aim, nothing less than to create a world system of financialcontrol in private hands able to dominate the political system of each countryand the economy of the world as a whole. This system was to be controlled in afeudalist fashion by the central banks of the world acting in concert, by secretagreements arrived at in frequent meetings and conferences.

This later grew into the European Union in 1993 containing 28 nationstates: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark,Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia,Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia,Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.Sociologist Mike Peters from Leeds Beckett University in England confirms, “Thesingle currency [the Euro] was rooted first by people who were connected withBilderberg,” and concludes, “The sheer wealth and importance of the people whoattend Bilderberg suggest that this is one of the most important politicalforums in the modern world.”65 [part0013.html#footnote65]Documents from Bilderberg’s less secretive sister organization, the Council onForeign Relations, reveal they have plans for several other massive regionalunions around the world, including the Eastern European Union, the MiddleEastern Union, an Asian-Pacific Union, African Union, South American Union, anda North American Union. Part of this plan includes unifying the currencies ofeach of these different unions as well. For example, in the case of the NorthAmerican Union—Canada, the United States and Mexico would all use what has beenproposed as the amero for all financial transactions.66[part0013.html#footnote66]The idea is, once these various regional unions are formed, and their currenciesunified, the final step will be to merge the unions (along with each of theirrespective currencies) into one global governing body, and at the same timeintroduce a global currency in the form of a digital dollar, ushering in the eraof a completely cashless society.67 [part0013.html#footnote67] Some haveproposed this new global currency be called the Phoenix, named after themythological bird which is said to rise from the ashes of its predecessor afterdeath in a cycle of rebirth and renewal.68 [part0013.html#footnote68] From ashesof the death of all previous currencies, the new global currency will emerge."},{"pageContent":"SELECTING WORLD LEADERSMany consider Bilderberg to be the Kingmakers or the place where a consensus ismade about which political candidate the Establishment will throw their supportbehind and which ones they’ll throw under the buss.

The 84-year-old formerCuban president published an article Wednesday that used three of the only eightpages in the Communist Party newspaper Granma to quote—largely verbatim—from a2006 book by Lithuanian-born writer Daniel Estulin. Estulin’s work, ‘The Secretsof the Bilderberg Club,’ argues that the international group largely runs theworld. It has held a secretive annual forum of prominent politicians, thinkersand businessmen since it was founded in 1954 at the Bilderberg Hotel inHolland.”90 [part0013.html#footnote90]This gets better. (laughing) They run the world, and they didn’t tell Castro.He’s just learning it here at 84 and he finds it fascinating. “Castro offered nocomment on the excerpts other than to describe Estulin as honest andwell-informed and to call his book a ‘fantastic story.’ Estulin’s book, asquoted by Castro, described ‘sinister cliques and the Bilderberg lobbyistsmanipulating the public ‘to install a world government that knows no borders andis not accountable to anyone but its own self.’ The Bilderberg group's websitesays its members have ‘nearly three days of informal and off-the-recorddiscussion about topics of current concern’ once a year, but the group doesnothing else.” So they get together three days a year and control the world(joking).They had a conspiracy, they didn’t tell Fidel about it, and he’s only learningabout it now when he’s retired and can’t join it and do anything about it.Walter Lippmann created the Beatles to distract people. Not only that, theBilderbergs created feminism to get men and women at war with one another todistract us while they destroyed world economies. That did work.

Just three days after the 9/11 attacks in 2001, the co-chair of theCouncil on Foreign Relations (and Bilderberg member) Gary Hart stated, “There isa chance for the President of the United States to use this disaster—to carryout what his father—a phrase his father used I think only once, and it hasn’tbeen used since—and that is a New World Order.”97 [part0013.html#footnote97]Longtime Bilderberg member and financier Henry Kissinger stated that theproblems Barack Obama’s administration was facing regarding the ongoing War onTerror and the economic collapse of 2008, “can give new impetus to Americanforeign policy partly because the reception of him is so extraordinary aroundthe world.

Part of Agenda 21 (the 21 meaning the 21st century) includesimplementing birth control programs to slow down the population growth. TheUnited Nations Population Fund, which was supposed to provide supplies andservices for reproductive health and birth control in third world countries, wasdiscovered to have also been involved with secret sterilizations and forcedabortions.144 [part0013.html#footnote144]President Obama’s chief science advisor John Holdren once wrote a book whichproposed adding sterilants to nations’ water supplies,145[part0013.html#footnote145] forcing women to get sterilized after their secondchild,146 [part0013.html#footnote146] and making them have abortions if they gotpregnant for a third time.147 [part0013.html#footnote147] The book, titledEcoscience, reads, “Indeed, it has been concluded that compulsorypopulation-control laws, even including laws requiring compulsory abortion,could be sustained under the existing Constitution if the population crisisbecame sufficiently severe to endanger the society.”148[part0013.html#footnote148] [Compulsory means forced or mandatory, by the way]Some see even more sinister methods on the table in order to accomplish thisgoal. The mysterious Georgia Guidestones monument calls for a global populationof only 500 million people. The strange monument consists of four giant slabs ofgranite which stand 19-feet-tall, laid out in a paddlewheel formation, each with10 different commandments carved into each of their eight faces, each one in adifferent langue (English, Spanish, Chinese, Russian, Swahili, Hindi, Hebrew,and Arabic). The structure, sometimes called “America’s Stonehenge,” is alsosaid to contain the “Guides to the New Age.” It was built in 1980 and stands inthe middle of nowhere in a field in the state of Georgia and is the creation ofan unknown man who said he represented an unnamed group who wanted the monumentbuilt. Some call it the 10 Commandments of the New World Order since some of the“Guides” call for a global government, a one world universal language, and saysthe overpopulation of humanity is a “cancer on the earth.”"},{"pageContent":"TOTAL SURVEILLANCE SOCIETYThere will be no more privacy if Bilderberg gets their way; no more anonymity,no more secrets—at least for the majority of us “regular folk.” Members of theParty [the government] in George Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four could actuallyturn off the Telescreens in their homes, a luxury ordinary citizens didn’t have;and the billionaires of Bilderberg will likely include some safeguards to ensuretheir own privacy remains in place while the rest of the world is forced to livein a fish bowl with everything we say, everywhere we go, everything we do, andeverything we buy recorded, catalogued, and stored indefinitely.149[part0013.html#footnote149]Facial recognition systems have been beta tested since the 1990s and are nowfully operational and being used at Las Vegas casinos,150[part0013.html#footnote150] hotels,151 [part0013.html#footnote151] shoppingmalls,152 [part0013.html#footnote152] sporting events,153[part0013.html#footnote153] airports,154 [part0013.html#footnote154] governmentbuildings,155 [part0013.html#footnote155] and on the streets of major cities.156[part0013.html#footnote156] Edward Snowden, the NSA whistle blower, confirmedwhat many had suspected for some time—the U.S. government had a sciencefiction-like system capable of recording all electronic communications andhacking into people’s email, social media accounts, and cell phones with theclick of a few keys, and with virtually no oversight or constraints.157[part0013.html#footnote157]Smart TVs and artificial intelligent personal assistants like Siri, Amazon Echo,and Jibo have the capability to remotely record the most personal of moments andconversations within people’s homes and bedrooms.158 [part0013.html#footnote158]Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four, which was published back in 1949, reads, “Thetelescreen received and transmitted simultaneously.

In the name of “safety”and convenience, most people have willingly given up every last bit of privacyin our digital age. Most haven’t even considered what could happen if civilliberties continue to slip or if the government were to grow too powerful andget out of control.The ability of government agencies to profile, Orwellianly discriminate against,or target individuals for IRS audits, ordinance violations, or other forms ofharassment based on their religious, personal, or political views is a realityeveryone is now vulnerable to getting swept up in.160[part0013.html#footnote160]Most major software developers and hardware manufactures have been coerced intobuilding backdoors into their products so the government can easily remotelyaccess people’s devices and cloud accounts, as well as bypass any encryptionthat has been applied to their files.161 [part0013.html#footnote161] The NSAeven has a program where they intercept laptop computers and other productscustomers order online and then install special spyware and hardware on them andthen package the items back up and send them on their way.162[part0013.html#footnote162]William Binney, a former high-level NSA official who worked for the agency formore than 30 years, resigned in 2001 after he discovered the surveillancesystems they were using gave the government the potential for what he called “aturnkey totalitarian state.”163 [part0013.html#footnote163] His home was raidedby the FBI in 2007 after he was suspected of leaking classified information tothe New York Times about the NSA’s spying programs.

Information is power, and masscommunication systems are central sources of this power. People often point toCommunist countries and their state-run media as examples of propaganda, whilethinking places like the United States has a “free press,” but the fact is themainstream media in America is carefully controlled as well.Edward Bernays, considered to be the ‘father of public relations,’ wrote, “Thosewho manipulate the unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisiblegovernment which is the true ruling power of our country. We are governed, ourminds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we havenever heard of...in almost every act of our lives whether in the sphere ofpolitics or business in our social conduct or our ethical thinking, we aredominated by the relatively small number of persons who understand the mentalprocesses and social patterns of the masses. It is they who pull the wires thatcontrol the public mind, who harness old social forces and contrive new ways tobind and guide the world.”165 [part0013.html#footnote165]He went on to admit, “Whatever of social importance is done today, whether inpolitics, finance, manufacture, agriculture, charity, education, or otherfields, must be done with the help of propaganda. Propaganda is the executivearm of the invisible government.”166 [part0013.html#footnote166]In America this is done through a combination of the centralization of mediaownership and through secret government programs which work to influence thenews and entertainment media. In the 1970s a Senate investigation uncovered theCIA’s media manipulation program called Operation Mockingbird, which was payinga billion dollars a year (in today’s dollars adjusted for inflation) to the topeditors and journalists of every major newspaper and television network tofunction as covert gatekeepers and propagandists for the government.167[part0013.html#footnote167]The director of the program, Thomas Braden, would later admit, “If the directorof the CIA wanted to extend a present, say, to someone…suppose he just thought,this man can use fifty thousand dollars, he’s working well and doing a goodjob—he could hand it to him and never have to account to anybody...There wassimply no limit to the money it could spend and no limit to the people it couldhire and no limit to the activities it could decide were necessary to conductthe war—the secret war...It was multinational.”168 [part0013.html#footnote168]According to the Congressional report into the matter, which was published in1976, “The CIA currently maintains a network of several hundred individualsaround the world who provide intelligence for the CIA and at times attempt toinfluence opinion through the use of covert propaganda. These individualsprovide the CIA with direct access to a large number of newspapers andperiodicals, scores of press services and news agencies, radio and televisionstations, commercial book publishers, and other foreign media outlets.”169[part0013.html#footnote169]Of course the CIA and top media figures deny such thing continues today—a claimwhich is absurd and demonstrably false. The Mockingbird program [or whatevercodename it operates under today] keeps certain stories out of the news or atleast prevents them from being a top story, and also functions to direct thenews networks to highlight specific stories or cast them in a certain light. Topstories and issues stuck circling in the news cycle for days or weeks are oftencarefully chosen for specific purposes.Even seemingly innocent entertainment is often covertly controlled and carefullycrafted to function as propaganda. It’s an open secret that the CIA and theDepartment of Defense have Entertainment Liaison Offices which work directlywith Hollywood producers and writers to help them make TV shows and blockbustermovies that deliver certain political messages in their story lines.170[part0013.html#footnote170] Shows like 24 and films like Zero Dark Thirty wereused to promote the idea that suspected terrorists need to be tortured in orderto save people’s lives, and that the heroes sometimes have to break the rules inorder to save the day.171 [part0013.html#footnote171]These liaison offices also provide consultants, access to military bases whichare used for shooting locations, expensive equipment like aircraft carriers,jets, tanks, etc., which are used in the projects, and even uniformed U.S.military soldiers who serve as extras.172 [part0013.html#footnote172] Inexchange for this priceless equipment, large numbers of extras, and access toactual military bases; TV and film studios agree to turn over the final scriptapproval to the entertain liaison officers who make changes in screenplays inorder to mold them into delivering the message they desire and have the finalsay over the plot.173 [part0013.html#footnote173]The emergence of social media has provided a problem for the dominanttraditional media outlets, since they give anyone the ability to potentiallyhave their message reach just as many people as content distributed through themainstream media channels. While this has empowered the average person who canwrite a blog, post something on Facebook, or upload a video on YouTube and makeit available for anyone to see, the corporate controllers have been scramblingto attempt to control this medium as well.Facebook and Instagram can—and do—make content containing specific keywords,certain hashtags or pictures, disappear down the memory hole and the posts justdon’t show up on others feeds or in searches.174 [part0013.html#footnote174]These services can prevent posts from going viral by limiting theirdistribution, largely without anyone detecting a post is being censored.175[part0013.html#footnote175] By using these popular social media and videosharing services, everyone must agree to their terms of service, which allowthese companies to restrict free speech under the banner of what they deem“inappropriate.”176 [part0013.html#footnote176] People are locked out ofaccounts as punishment for several days or have their entire account shut downfor “violating the terms of service” if they post something the companies havedeemed violates their standards.177 [part0013.html#footnote177]By the time most of these major social media companies became widely used by thepublic, they were quietly purchased by massive corporations after beingauctioned off at the secretive Sun Valley Conference which is held in Idahoevery summer.178 [part0013.html#footnote178] This small gathering in a remotetown brings together the newest social media startups to meet with the currentbig names in technology, media, as well as heads of the CIA, NSA, and othergovernment agencies where they come to a consensus on how to deal with new,independent communication companies and emerging technology.179[part0013.html#footnote179]It’s a Brave New World, and even though we’re living in the Information Age,most people unfortunately couldn’t care less about current events, history, orthe direction society is headed. They instead have become lost in anentertainment wasteland and are constantly streaming digital distractions tooccupy their mind with meaningless gibberish, crude comedy, and gratuitousviolence in what many people now consider to be an Idiocracy or theEntertainment Age."},{"pageContent":"CONCLUSIONIs the press in America really free and independent when, for over 50 years,every major American newspaper and television network have buried their heads inthe sand each year when the Bilderberg Group meets? Did they all just miss thestory year after year, decade after decade? No news editor or journalist canhonestly say the annual meeting isn’t interesting and newsworthy. Certainly itcan’t be called a coincidence when word of Bilderberg began to go viral throughsocial media and alternative news websites, that finally some mainstream outletsbegan mentioning it in passing—almost always, of course, pointing out that“conspiracy theorists” were suspicious.Their tax returns show that media companies like the Washington Post haveliterally helped to pay for their meetings, and major talk radio show hosts whohave their finger on the pulse of politics in America have either played dumbpretending to know nothing about Bilderberg, or ridiculed anyone askingreasonable questions about the group or their activities.Perhaps now that they’ve been forced out of the shadows, Bilderberg will attemptto “go legit” and pretend the decades of denials, news blackouts, and ridiculeof the “conspiracy theorists” who are curious or concerned about them justdidn’t happen at all. As we’ve seen countless times throughout history, aftercorrupt politicians and corporate leaders repeatedly dodge questions, denyfacts, and ridicule inquiries—the truth of their activities eventually comesout.Everyone knows that politics is a dirty business and lying is pretty much theonly policy politicians are consistent on. They flip flop, they soften theirpositions in order to gain favor with certain groups and avoid offending othershoping to get elected, and if anyone knows anything about politicians andbillionaire businessmen it’s that they will do anything to gain and maintaintheir power. The list of massive deceptions perpetuated by those in power islong. “There are Weapons of Mass Destruction in Iraq.” “The NSA isn’t spying onAmerican citizens.” “If you like your health insurance policy, you can keep it.”“Read my lips, no new taxes.” And now we can add “the Bilderberg Group is just aconspiracy theory,” to that list as well.In 2011 when the digital dam began to burst, and the Drudge Report first postedabout it, Forbes magazine finally decided to write an article which started offsaying, “The annual Bilderberg Conference will convene this weekend,thus throwing the Internet into a tizzy,” and that “Conspiracy theorists believethe Bilderbergers control the course of world events. That through crisis anduncertainty they steer society’s great developments with an ultimate goal ofestablishing a New World Order.”180 [part0013.html#footnote180]After making the customary dig at “conspiracy theorists,” the Forbes articlesurprising got somewhat serious, saying, “It is certainly concerning thatrepresentatives from Washington, Wall Street and the media will meet with noaccount of their dealings or details of their plans. Their counterparts fromacross the North Atlantic will attend too. It reeks of collusion and intrigue.The lack of transparency and potential for concentrated power spurs theimagination, while unsettling the mind. The media, despite some of its mostinfluential personalities participating, will ignore the proceedings.”181[part0013.html#footnote181]That same week Time magazine also broke their silence, admitting, “In the pastfew years, the mystery surrounding the Bilderberg group has faded slightlybecause of interest from journalists,” and as expected, added, “the defenders ofthe ‘conspiracy theory’ who keep denouncing the ‘Illuminati’ are stillactive.”182 [part0013.html#footnote182]Only time will tell what happens regarding the Bilderberg Group’s secrethistory. You can’t put the toothpaste back in the tube, as the saying goes, so Iwrote this book as a record of the decades of denials and news blackouts of oneof the world’s biggest conspiracy facts.Unfortunately most of their work is pretty much done. The New World Order globalgovernment is in its final phase; the Big Brother Orwellian surveillance systemshave been built to track, trace, and database all electronic communications;183[part0013.html#footnote183] the American Constitution has been subverted; mostof the population has been sedated, distracted, and dumbed down through endlessentertainment available at the click of a mouse or the tap of a finger. Butthankfully at the same time, the era of Bilderberg’s secrecy is coming to anend, and for those who take the time to research things for themselves insteadof just consuming what the mainstream media is dishing out, a clear vision ofreality can come into focus.Thanks for reading this book to the very end. I hope you have found it conciseand to the point without getting bogged down by unnecessary filler orunconfirmable wild accusations. I personally have been studying the BilderbergGroup for over ten years and it has been fascinating to see word spread so farand wide about them in the age of social media and YouTube.If you found this book interesting or valuable in your pursuit of the truthplease take a moment to write a brief review and rate it on Amazon.com or at thee-book store where you downloaded it from.

It is certainly a dyingpastime in our entertainment age, as we are on the verge of an apparentIdiocracy as society continues to sink down a cultural abyss. As media analystNeil Postman wrote in his 1985 classic Amusing Ourselves to Death, “When apopulation becomes distracted by trivia, when cultural life is redefined as aperpetual round of entertainments, when serious public conversation becomes aform of baby-talk, when, in short, a people become an audience and their publicbusiness a vaudeville act, then a nation finds itself at risk; culture-death isa clear possibility.”184 [part0013.html#footnote184] "},{"pageContent":"FURTHER READINGTHE ILLUMINATI: FACTS & FICTIONSecret societies have both fascinated and frightened people for hundreds ofyears.
