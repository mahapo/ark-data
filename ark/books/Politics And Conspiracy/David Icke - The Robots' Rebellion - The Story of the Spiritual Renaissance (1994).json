I would say not. I thinkthat how the Universe was formed is extremely interesting, but notsomething that it is essential to know in order to find the path thatwill lead us out of this mess.What we really need to know - the Big Question - is who we reallyare and what we are doing here in this period of fantastic change andtransformation on Planet Earth. From that understanding, all theother answers will come - including how the Universe was formed.Without that appreciation of the true nature of life, we will go onbeing mesmerised by this physical world and largely controlled by itsillusions and by those misguided forces, detailed in this book, whichseek to turn us into little more than zombies. In other words, we willdestroy ourselves.The irony is that the information already exists to tell us all weneed to know, but the implications of this knowledge are socatastrophic for religion, establishment science, education(indoctrination) and the whole economic, political, industrial, andmilitary system, that these answers have been suppressed. Whensuppression has not been possible, those who articulate the eternalunderstanding have been ridiculed, condemned and undermined inevery way imaginable. We still refer to the Great Mysteries of Life,but they only remain ‘mysteries’ because of the consequences for thesystem of their solution. We are talking here of the most monumentalcon-trick in the history of the human race, a sleight of hand and mindthat involves not only people, but other areas of the Universe too. Ithas been a piece of black magic so successful that it has programmedthe minds of billions of people to forget who they are, where theycame from, and what they are doing here today.I believe it is time for some straight talking.

But, slowly at firstand now ever more quickly, the robots are awakening. Instead ofmeekly accepting a daily diet of mind control, more and more peopleare seeing the world in a new light and asking questions they havenever asked before. The veil is lifting and the robots’ rebellion hasarrived.In this book, I will tell the story of how we forgot our true identityand how the forces of control are preparing to enter the final phase oftheir plan to take over the planet and the human race. Humanity hasbeen gripped by a spiritual amnesia which has taken us down a darkand dangerous path from which we are now in the process ofescaping, or not, depending on the choices we make. Most of whatyou are about to read will not be new to you. You already know it.You have merely forgotten. You have a memory that retains some ofwhat you have experienced in this physical lifetime, but humanityhas lost contact with its higher memory; that part of us which knowsthe Big Answers to the Big Questions. This book will help you torestore the links with that memory and, once that begins to happen,as it has already begun for countless millions around the world today,you are never going to be the same again.Those who are moving along this road to rediscovery are the oneswho are leading the robots’ rebellion. It is vital for the future of thehuman race for as many as possible to wake up and set out on thatsame journey. Only by triggering and expanding a reconnection withour higher levels of being will we have access to the information andlove that we so desperately need in order to heal ourselves and,through that, to help to heal this beautiful planet we call Earth. Westand on the threshold of indescribable and incomprehensible change.We cannot know exactly what will unfold, because humans areaffecting the detail with every passing minute, but we can be surethat nothing and no-one will be left untouched by what is happeningon the planet.

Thay may sound fantastic to you at this stage, butread on and you will see that it is very real and affecting our livesevery day. It is, however, a conspiracy that we can, and will,dismantle.At the heart of this attack on human freedom is the desire to keepfrom us the knowledge of the spiritual realities of our true selves andthe understanding of our place in this wondrous web of life we callCreation. If you have heard the explanations about the eternal natureof consciousness and how we are all on an endless journey ofevolution through experience, it is fine to move straight on to the firstchapter. If such information is new to you it is worth reading thefollowing short summary of the knowledge which the manipulatorshave, but which they don’t want to share with anyone else:The real us is not the physical body we see. That is the vehicle weinhabit for a single physical lifetime on this planet. The eternal us isour consciousness, our spirit, our mind. At that moment wemistakenly call ‘death’ our eternal mind - the thinking, feeling, us -leaves the body and moves on to continue its evolution elsewhere.This is what happens in a so-called ‘near death experience’.Thousands have described the sensation of leaving their bodiesduring heart attacks or road accidents. They tell the same basic storyof looking down on their physical bodies while doctors try to revivethem. “It was my mind, my personality, looking down”, they say,“but I was no longer part of my body.” Then suddenly they findthemselves looking out through their eyes again and they havereturned to the body. This is all that happens to people when they‘die’. Their consciousness leaves the body. Our physical form has afinite life, of course, but our minds live forever. You could think of itas similar to the principle of the spaceman on the Moon. He dons anouter shell to experience another planet. During a physical life ourminds inhabit the physical shell we call a body.Consciousness and energy are one and the same. All that exists"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"xiiithroughout Creation is the same energy-consciousness in differentstates of being. The diference between everything is their level ofconsciousness (evolution, understanding, awareness), and the speedthe energy is vibrating - at its ‘frequency’. The faster the vibration,the higher the evolution. One example of how a single substance canbe many things is water, clouds and ice. These look, feel, and reactvery differently, but they are all the same substance in different statesof being. So it is with the energy-consciousness that is everything.The force we call ‘God’ is not some guy with a beard sitting on athrone. It is the One Consciousness that is Creation; a wall, the sky,the rain, you, me, everything is ‘God’. We are all droplets in the sameocean of consciousness. You are me, and I am you. You areeverything, and so am I. We are each other, all aspects of the samewhole, part of the same seamless stream of energy. The apparentdivisions between us are an illusion.One of the so-called ‘great mysteries’ is where we go after ourphysical lives have ended. The Church says to heaven or hell,whatever that is supposed to mean, and materialistic science says wego nowhere because this world is all there is. In fact the ocean ofconsciousness we call Creation or God has infinite levels ofevolution or wavelengths. In the space your body is occupying noware all the frequencies of all the radio and television stationsbroadcasting to your area. You can’t see them and they can’t see eachother, even though they are sharing the same space, because they areon different wavelengths. Tune a radio to one of those wavelengthsand that is the station you will here. The frequency becomes theradio’s reality, its ‘world’. Move the dial to another station and theradio’s reality changes. It is the same with us. At this time we aretuned to the dense physical wavelength we call the Universe, butwhen we ‘die’ our consciousness leaves the body and moves on toanother wavelength.What we call ‘ghosts’ are entities - minds, spirits, - on otherwavelengths. They often look misty and transparent, because we arenot seeing them from their frequency, but ours. It is the same when aradio dial, is not quite on the station and you get a fuzzy, less-than-sharp reception. The dominating station will be the one nearest thedial but you will hear other stations, too. In visual terms, that is whatis happening when we see a ghost. If you were on the same frequencyas the ghost, it would look as real as you do. The extra-terrestrials Iwill be talking about operate at least mostly on other frequencies,"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"xivwhich is why some people see them and some don’t. It dependswhatever you are capable of making that psychic leap to tune to otherlevels.It is by tuning your consciousness to another wavelength thatinformation can be brought through this world. This is the process wecall channelling, mediumship, or tuning in psychically. Real, open-minded, scientists are showing in their research into physics andmathematics that Creation is, indeed, made up of frequencies, andthat consciousness is eternal in everyone. However, they have tocontend with the suppression of this knowledge by the scientificestablishment and the manipulators who control it. These want you tobelieve that the physical world is all there is and that we are allcosmic ‘accidents’ of evolution who don’t exist before birth or afterdeath. What nonsense!Consciousness is constantly reproducing itself as Creation expandsinto the void and into infinity. At the highest level, the highestfrequency, is the original consciousness from which everything hascome. It is the sum total of all that has been learned and experiencedsince Creation became conscious. This is the level you could call theGodhead. I prefer to call it the Source. It, too, is constantly evolvingby observing and absorbing the experiences of all aspects of itself onthe lower frequencies. The Source is the Super Mind from whicheverything has come.I have used the term ‘mind’ to describe the eternal part of us,because I prefer to avoid the religious connotations of ‘soul’. Butmind, soul, and spirit are interchangeable for terms to describe theamalgamation of energy fields that animate the physical body andwhich never die. These exist on what science calls the sub-atomiclevel which is why we can’t see them. The energies normally vibratetoo quickly for our physical senses, although some sensitive peoplecan detect them. When we talk of people ‘seeing auras’ they areobserving this consciousness around the body. It can be a glorioustapestry of colours, our ‘coat of many colours’ which changes withour moods because colours, like everything else, are energyvibrations. As our state of mind alters, so do the subtleties of ourvibrational state.These energy fields, aspects of our mind, reincarnate into countlessphysical bodies on this planet and elsewhere. We are allextraterrestrials, in that we are here on this planet as part, and onlypart, of our evolution. Each of us will have had past lives throughout"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"xvwhat we call history. We have been here many times in so manydifferent situations and races. This makes the prejudice of racism andnationalism so utterly ludicrous. Through the law of karma or causeand effect we are creating our own futures with every thought andact, because it is true that what we make others experience we willourselves eventually experience to balance out our evolution.Connecting all our energy fields is a series of vortices calledchakras. There are seven main ones and countless smaller versions.The main chakras are at the base of the spine (base chakra), the navel(sacral chakra), the solar plexus (solar plexus chakra), the heart(heart chakra), the throat (throat chakra), the forehead (brow or thirdeye chakra) and on top of the head (crown chakra). As we learn andevolve, the chakra vortices spin quicker and raise the vibration of oureternal being, so elevating us to higher frequencies. The energy wecall love comes from the heart chakra and this is how the heart firstbecame associated with love. Today it is portrayed as a physicalheart, but, as the ancients knew, the energy of love emanates from thespiritual heart.The chakras are linked to the physical body through the endocrinesystem, and imbalances in the energy fields can affect the balance ofthe body. It is in this way that stress and other emotional traumacause physical illness. These energy fields are electromagnetic andare affected by other forms of electromagnetism. It is known thatpeople who work with electromagnetic equipment or live underpower lines are more prone to certain illnesses and cancers. Doctorsand scientists say they don’t know why this happens, but in fact theeletromagnetism from the power lines and technology disrupts theperson’s electromagnetic energy fields, and this filters down to thephysical body to manifest as a health problem.The mind is a creator because everything is thought. The morepowerful the consciousness, the greater its potential to create. On thenon-physical frequencies thought creates directly by rearranging theenergies into whatever the thought visualises. Even on the densephysical level, all creation must be preceded by a thought. A finalisedbusiness deal and a finished piece of pottery are thoughts madephysical. Thought is all.Every time we think we create an energy field, a thought form, andthis is how telepathy works. One person produces the thought fieldand another decodes that field, mostly without even knowing it. Thepower of thought to create love and harmony or hate and disharmony"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"xviis endless and we are all capable of producing both. Themanipulators I speak of in this book know about this power to controlpeople by the use of thought or ‘psychic attack’ as it is called. Theydirect thought energy at targeted individuals and try to control theirthinking. Those who seek love and harmony in the world need torespond to this misguided behaviour with the energy of love andharmony which we can all create whenever we wish. Wejust have tothink it and live it. We create our own reality. If we think failure, thatis the energy we will attract to us. We attract what we most fear, forexample, on the principle of like attracts like and this is the basis onwhich the Law of Karma operates also.The manipulators do not want us to know that we are eternal beingsof light and love with limitless potential; nor that we can change theworld by changing the way we think; and certainly not that we are allOne, all equal parts of the same whole, on ajourney of evolutionthrough experience. People who know and live all these things arenot nearly so easy to control and direct. It would be much better topersuade us that we are cosmic accidents with no future, or imprisonus in the dogma of some rigid religion, and do everything possible toridicule and repress information to the contrary.Their aim is to de-link us from the higher levels of ourselves.During an incarnation, not all of our mind, consciousness, incarnatesand becomes subject to the severe pressures and limitations of adense physical body, only part of it. I call this the conscious level.The rest of the mind, what has become known as the subconsciousand higher conscious levels, act as a guide through a physical life.The conscious level (lower self) experiences and the subconsciousand higher conscious levels (higher self) guides through a process ofthought transfer.The higher self can be linked to Mission Control. It knows thereason for the incarnation - what we have chosen to experience andwho with - and what we have chosen to do in service to humanity, theplanet, and Creation in general. We feel the urgings andcommunciations of the higher self in our intuition. We feel drawn tocertain places, people, and ways of life. It shows when we say “fancymeeting you here”, “what a small world”, and “what a coincidence”.If we lose touch with Mission Control, our higher consciousness,we can get ourselves into terrible trouble and be prone to some stupidand destructive behaviour. Think what would happen if we were onthe Moon in a spacesuit and someone cut the link with Mission"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"xviiControl. We would have only two sources of information - what iscoming in through the eyes and the ears. This would, by definition,be extremely imbalanced, because it would only contain informationfrom the world immediately around us. We would lose contact withthose who can see the wider picture.So if we can be encouraged to switch off the connection with ourpersonal Mission Control, the higher self, and the manipulators can atthe same time control the flow of information coming in through theeyes and the ears, we can quite easily forget who we really are andwhat we are doing here. This has happened to billions of people, whohave thus become a form of robot.I have explained these principles in greater depth in other books,and it would be helpful for those new to the subject to read Heal TheWorld or Truth Vibrations in conjunction with this one. But withinthe brief summary here is contained the knowledge as you willappreciate later that can not only free the human race from its currentmental imprisonment, but also provide incredible technology toproduce limitless, non-polluting energy.Why and how this knowledge has been kept from the mass of thepeople and what has led humanity along such a dark and destructivepath is the story we will now tell."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"1PART ONETHE DARKNESS"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"21The Takeover BidWhen anyone talks about the origin of God they soon findthemselves facing familiar, unanswerable questions: ‘Who createdGod?’ and ‘Who created the one who created God?’ and...You will forgive me, therefore, if I deal with only one generation ofGod’s family history! My belief is that what we call Creation wasonce a void that was mere potential. At some point, at least a part ofthis void became conscious and aware of itself. I know some open-minded scientists who have offered explanations based onmathematics and physics of how this could have happened, but all Iam sure about is that it did happen.I will call this original consciousness The Source. Over anincomprehensible period of what we call time the SourceConsciousness began to experiment with its potential to create.Through the power of thought, it created other aspects of itself andareas within its vast mind for experience and learning. Among thesewas our Universe and all that it contains - including us. Each area isrelatively self-contained within the Ocean of Consciousness and hasbeen allowed to evolve naturally through experience, although allremains connected to the Source. Universes, like all of Creation, aremade up of multi-dimensions with each having its own version ofspace and time. What we call time on this planet is very differentfrom that of other frequencies. If you saw our space-time Universefrom above, it would look a little like a doughnut or, more to thepoint, a coil going round and round, orbiting the centre. Everything isin orbit around a central point. The Earth is orbiting the Sun, as weall know, but the solar system is also in orbit, as are the galaxy andthe Universe. Each ‘coil’ is encircled within a vortex, a spiral ofenergy. The quicker this spiral vortex spins, the quicker the Universemoves through its orbit and, consequently, the quicker ‘time’ appearsto pass. The vortex around our Universe is beginning to spin more"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"3quickly which is why when so many people say, ‘time just flies thesedays, there’s no time to do everything any more’, they are absolutelyright. Hold on tight. We have seen nothing yet.Streams of information emanate from The Source to guide Creationwhile, from the other direction, flow all the experiences and learningachieved by its constituent parts. There is a two-way flow ofinformation between the Source and all areas of its mind. So, whilethe Source is the ultimate in knowledge, wisdom and love at anygiven point, it, too, is constantly evolving as it absorbs theexperiences of all its ‘droplets’. The flow of information from theSource comes to this planet via various ‘sub-stations’ such as theUniverse and Galaxy. It comes in through the Sun to the planets ofthis solar system. Each level adds its contribution to the informationflow to guide the levels below. The Sun is far more than a massiveball of fire, generating warmth. It is another substation for Sourceenergies. The ancients knew this, or at least their most highly evolvedmembers did, and this is one explanation for the origin of the Sungod and Sun worship. The more enlightened members of theirnumber were not worshipping a ball of fire in the sky, they wereacknowledging the Solar Logos (Central Sun) through which theknowledge and wisdom of the Source reaches the planet.Just as the Sun is the mind that guides the solar system; theGalactic Mind guides the galaxy and the Universal Mind guides theUniverse. The Source is the mind that guides all Creation. Sun spotactivity is linked to this flow of energy from the Sun to the solarsystem and this indicates the times when the flow is at its mostpowerful. We all have the opportunity to tune into this guidance fromthe highest level, the Source, but we don’t have to. We can ignore it ifwe wish.It may seem hard to believe sometimes when we look at what ishappening in the world, but Creation is another word for love. It isthe energy we call love that holds everything together. Creation is notdesigned to bring pain and suffering. That is not its purpose. I knowthat people from all beliefs and backgrounds have tried to explainthis contradiction between a Creation based on love and some of theappalling events that happen minute by minute on Planet Earth. Somespeak of the need for learning through extreme experience whileothers talk of some massive universal ‘experiment’ that has beengoing on. Neither has felt right to me. If Creation is founded and heldtogether by love, then love must be at the heart of what has happened"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"4to the Earth and the human race. Just as this book was beingcompleted, I heard an explanation which, at last, felt good to me. Iwas sitting in the quiet of the abbey ruins on a wonderful summerday at Glastonbury in Somerset, England, not far from the famousGlastonbury Tor. With me was a very close friend of my family andmyself, a highly sensitive psychic called Yeva. She began to channelinformation projected by a blue energy field she saw psychicallyaround us. From what came through that day and from the otherinformation I have received directly or through other channels, I feelthat the following is close to the truth, at least in theme:A very long time ago, an aspect of consciousness became highlyimbalanced and decided to challenge the laws of Creation. Thesewere not laws written down in a book and administered by a judge.They were, you might say, like the laws of physics. Everything needsa negative-positive and male-female balance if harmony is to reign inits consciousness. The balance does not have to be perfect, becauseboth negative and positive experiences are necessary for evolution.But the further you stray from balance, the more extreme lifebecomes. If you go too far to the positive polarity you lose touchwith the practical side of life; you float off in a spiritual mist. It’s abit like the feeling I am told you have when you smoke pot or, as Ican report from experience, the feeling you have after drinking a fewbeers. You are not quite here. Everyone can be very nice to everyoneelse, but nothing gets done. If you have a serious negative imbalance,this will manifest itself in extreme negative behaviour - anger,aggression, conflict, a wish to control and dominate, pain, fear andsuffering in all its forms.I will call the droplet seeking to disharmonise Creation, Lucifer. Iwill use the term Lucifer when I am speaking of the original dropletof disharmony and Luciferic consciousness when I am describing theamalgamation of that aspect and all the other consciousness he hassince imbalanced, to the extent that it now dances to his tune. In fact,Lucifer is a misnomer really, in that, if you go back to the origin ofthe name Lucifer, it breaks down as ‘bringer of light’. This comesfrom the universal truth that positive energy needs a negativebalancer. When both are in harmony, you get the energy of balanceand love which is called The Light. The positive needs the negativeas much as the negative needs the positive. This idea of the balancingof two forces, positive-negative, male-female, good-evil, yin-yangand so on, I totally agree with. But, for the purposes of this book, I"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"5will use the name Lucifer to describe something quite different fromthat. The imbalanced consciousness I will call Lucifer is not anessential part of the positive-negative balance. He is a disrupting,disharmonious aspect of consciousness which is not necessary forhuman evolution. More than that, Lucifer’s efforts to close off thechannels that link humanity to its higher understanding have blocked,not advanced, our evolution. No experience is wasted and all goesinto the bank of learning, but I feel strongly that we did not need toplumb the depths in order to reach the state of understanding that willraise us to a higher frequency. A balance of negative and positiveexperience is one thing, but I do not believe the negative extremeswe have seen on Earth have had to be part of that.Lucifer wished to experiment with the laws of balance andharmony. I refer to this mind as ‘he’ because he is dominated, notonly by negative energy, but by male energy also. At one time he wasa consciousness of balance, love and advanced evolution - but thatwas to change. It may well be that something happened which wasbeyond his control but which initially imbalanced this aspect ofconsciousness. It could be that an experiment he conducted into whatwould happen if you opposed the laws of harmony went terriblywrong - rather like creating a spiritual Frankenstein which ends upcontrolling the scientist. Whatever the background, Lucifer began tochallenge the harmony of Creation. I have long been aware of thisbut Yeva’s channelling added a decisive piece to the puzzle. Itanswered the question of why humanity has been a target of thisLuciferic Consciousness.Creation is not some random, uncoordinated, every-droplet-for-itself chaos. When this Luciferic consciousness began to make itsdisharmony felt, the higher levels of Creation began to intervenebecause it was imposing its misunderstandings on others andbreaking the universal law of free will. Something had to be done, asthey say. This is where humanity comes in. Again, contrary topopular belief, the human consciousness stream has an enormouscapacity for love and compassion. We are not what we seem to be,but then nothing is ever what it seems. A decision was made at thecollective level of human consciousness to give this disruptive mindcalled Lucifer an opportunity to find its balance again and to re-synchronise with the rest of Creation.Every species has a collective mind to which all of the individual‘droplets’ are connected. We are multi-dimensional beings, with each"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"6level having its own awareness and ability to think and makedecisions. So it was that the collective mind of humanity agreed toset aside its own evolution for a certain period to give the Lucifericconsciousness a chance to re-balance itself. This highly negativeconsciousness was unleashed on this part of the Universe. It was notonly humanity which agreed to this, the collective minds of otheruniversal civilisations (extra-terrestrials) did the same, and not onlythe physical level was affected. Everything is multidimensional,including the Universe. In the same space occupied by this physicalworld are all the other levels. The Luciferic consciousness began tooperate on those levels, too.The effects did not happen overnight. But disharmony creates moredisharmony and, once the Luciferic consciousness had begun todisrupt the balance and flow of the energies, it started a roll whichwould gather pace on an ever-steepening curve. Disharmony createdeven more disharmony. Lucifer is clearly not a being with horns anda tail. He is a large aspect of Divine consciousness which chose towork against the Source. Like all consciousness, he generatesthought patterns. It is the same principle as that employed by a radiostation when it transmits its wavelength to the world. Oncetransmitted, the wavelength can be picked up by any radio tuned tothat station. Everyone is transmitting thought patterns every second.So, when you have a powerful and ever-growing aspect ofconsciousness pouring Qut negative patterns of great disharmony, itis easy to see how vast areas of other consciousness can be affected.Once they are tuned to your wave-length you can, like a radio station,feed them any information you wish them to hear. In consciousnessterms, these transmitted patterns can appear to be thoughts of ourown when they really originate in the minds of others. In suchinstances, we are merely tuning to them without realising it.The Luciferic consciousness and its broadcasts were designed tocreate imbalance. Lucifer feeds off negative en&gy and the more ofthat that he can generate, the stronger and more powerful hebecomes. His impact began to grow and affect a wider area. Otherdroplets were imbalanced by the disharmony and turmoil and joinedthe ‘team’ or what I call collectively the Luciferic consciousness. Thethinking and perceptions of increasing numbers of entities in thissolar system and galaxy were affected. The Luciferic consciousness,far from taking the opportunity to re-balance itself, was trying to takeover and turn harmony into the image of its own imbalance. The"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"7moment arrived when the ongoing process of disharmony was suchthat a call went out across the Universe for volunteers to dedicatethemselves, for however long was necessary, to reverse it. Theocean of consciousness was ceasing to be a gentle, balanced flow. Insome areas it was more like a tidal wave of emotional and mentalturmoil and torment. Throughout the book I will refer to the‘volunteers’ or ‘volunteer consciousness’. By this I mean those whohave dedicated themselves to restore harmony and help the Earth tore-synchronise with the rest of the Galactic and Universal family.These volunteers came forward on many levels and the strugglebegan between light and dark, a theme seen throughout ancient textsand legends. This has been portrayed symbolically in films like StarWars and The Empire Strikes Back. The writers of much sciencefiction are really tapping into a memory of what actually happened,not always in detail, but in theme. This struggle between harmonyand disharmony has been happening on all levels, physical and non-physical.Other volunteers, aspects of very highly-evolved consciousness,came into the Universe and this galaxy in an effort to restoreharmony. They did not incarnate in physical bodies on the Earth.They arrived in massive spacecraft, some of them miles in length,while others simply manifested themselves here. These were extra-terrestrials who came to bring knowledge to this planet hundreds ofthousands of years ago. There were two distinct life streams on theplanet then, the highly evolved extra-terrestrials and the much moreprimitive Earth people. The idea was that, over thousands of years,the Earth people would be helped to evolve more quickly.Waves of these beings began many civilisations on the Earth,including the ones we know as Pan, Mu (Lemuria) and Atlantis.These civilisations were much more advanced in their technologyand understanding of Creation than we are today. Plato talked ofAtlantis more than two thousand years ago and it has been a themethat has recently grown more powerful in the human mind. It was acontinent in what is now the Atlantic Ocean. Atlantis was powered bythe use of non-physical energy, the harnessing of the sea of energyaround us. Crystals were part of this power and light Source and allthe power and warmth they needed was produced without anypollution or damage to the Earth. That knowledge is going to beavailable to us as the present transformation continues. Indeed, muchof it is already available but has been suppressed to protect empires"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"8of self interest. There was no religion as such at that time but therewere places where people went to learn the laws of Creation and howto use energies to create harmony and to speed the positive progressof human understanding. They could communicate with animalstelepathically and through sound, particularly with that most evolvedof non-human life, the dolphin. The Atlanteans could perform whatwe would see today as miracles. They were not miracles at all. Thereis no such thing as a miracle or the paranormal. They are simply thenatural laws of Creation at work. Atlanteans could levitate objectsand themselves at will; they could cause spontaneous combustion;they could manifest and de-manifest matter. They raised its vibratoryrate until it ceased to be physical. Then, when they restored itsoriginal vibration, it reappeared as a physical form.Their bodies were different from ours and very different from thoseof the Earth people on the planet at that time. They were less denseand they could float above the ground through the power of theirconsciousness. Many could materialise and de-materialise themselvesalong the lines of ‘Beam me up, Scotty’ in Star Trek but without theneed for its technology. They were much taller than we are. Sensitivepeople who have had visions of this Atlantean time speak of seeingfigures of seven feet and more, with gold complexions and slanting,pale blue eyes. The Atlanteans also lived for many hundreds of yearsin each incarnation because their bodies were more in tune with theenergies around them. As they understood the true nature of life, theycould treat disease (disharmony) before it became a physicalproblem. Today we wait for the physical symptoms but, by then, it isoften too late. The volunteer consciousness which are known asAtlanteans came to raise the understanding on this planet in order tohelp the Luciferic consciousness to break out of its spiral ofdisharmony and to protect the human consciousness from beingaffected by that disharmony.All was well in Atlantis for a long time, but slowly the imbalancesand pressures which continued to build up under the bombardment ofthe Luciferic consciousness began to tell. Over aeons of existence,the Luciferic consciousness had learned how best to disrupt harmonyand how to imbalance other aspects by working through theiremotional levels. The production of negative energy by whatevermeans available was the motivation because such negative energyfeeds it and gives it greater power. The reason for conflict wasirrelevant as long as there was conflict and a production line of"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"9negative energy. Planets were destroyed, either by direct interventionfrom Lucifer or by his thought patterns scrambling the consciousnessof others. A planet known by the Sumerians as Maldek was destroyedby nuclear explosion created by scientists who had the knowledgewithout the wisdom. (See Allan & Delair’s When The Earth NearlyDied). Some of the debris of that planet and others is still flyingaround the solar system in forms we call asteroids and comets. Someof the debris is held in the rings of Saturn. Too incredible to accept?Look what we are doing to this planet. We are destroying her by thestupid way in which we behave and that is what has happenedelsewhere, either through exploitation, nuclear explosions, or by thepoisoning of the atmosphere in some other way. Has humanity as awhole been under the influence of a force for good? No. Exactly.The time arrived when Luciferic extra-terrestrials sought to takeover the planet and wars were fought between the, by now,countless extra-terrestrial civilisations that wished to either help orexploit this world. The harmony of early. Atlantis had long gone.The Earth which was created as the planet of balance and agenerator of love began to pour out negative energy into the system.Things were going terribly wrong and it was having a serious affecton the mind of the planet, the consciousness we call Mother Nature,the Earth Spirit, or Gaia. The Earth is the dense physical body ofthis mind and we all exist within her energy field, her aura. Whenhumanity creates negative energy she absorbs it and, through her, itis exported to the solar system, the Universe, and beyond. Luciferturned his negative power on the Earth Spirit, working to disrupt heron all levels by imbalancing her energy fields - especially her mindand emotions. His thought patterns worked on her emotions bothdirectly and by affecting her physical form. When our bodies aregiving us pain it affects our emotions. A planet consciousness is nodifferent. The extra-terrestrial volunteers who agreed to restoreharmony and to raise consciousness on the physical level foundthemselves facing an enormous challenge from other extra-terrestrial sources who came to the planet in their enormousspacecraft. Many were so affected that they, also, began to work forthe negative forces.Knowledge is neutral. It is how you use it that is positive ornegative. Those who understood how the energies and the power ofcrystals could be used were known in Atlantis as the Guardians of theLight and the Keepers of the Secret Knowledge. Only those who, it"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"10was felt, could be trusted to use the knowledge positively were toldof its secrets. However, here we had a situation where the power ofthe Lucifer influence was such that many of these people had becomeseriously imbalanced. As a consequence, knowledge which waspotentially lethal was falling into the wrong hands. Many Atlanteansbegan to use their knowledge in highly negative ways as did theextra-terrestrials who hijacked Atlantis.For hundreds of thousands of years during Atlantis and earlier,extra-terrestrials from various universal civilisations had beenseeding the human race and advancing the physical form. Some didthis for positive reasons, some with their own agenda in mind. Thethemes of this are documented in ancient texts and on clay tabletswritten some 6,000 years ago by the Sumerians. The Sumer recordsspeak of ‘gods’ coming down from the sky to impregnate women andthen returning to the stars. The human form as we know it, HomoSapiens Sapiens to give it its full title, did not evolve from the apefamily but from other universal civilisations around 20,000 years orso before the final cataclysm sank what remained of Atlantis about10,OOOBC. In fact, the ape family came from the impregnation ofanimal forms by ETs as part of their experimentation. Scientists talkof the ‘missing link’ between Neanderthal man and the presenthuman body, but they will never find it, because it doesn’t exist. Thesudden evolutionary advance in the human form came from theintervention of extra-terrestrials some positive in their intent, somenegative.The Sumer records say that a ‘god’ called Ea was involved in thisgenetic engineering. They say he had a half-brother called En-lil and,as we will see, these were two of the Sumer ‘gods’ that would bepassed on into the belief systems of religions to this day. Most of theearly Old Testament stories come from Sumer or earlier and relate tothis time towards the end of Atlantis when negative ETs were largelyin control. A Sumerian ‘hymn’ has been discovered which describesthe tree of life, the fruit of which the gods had forbidden Man to eat.This tree was in the Garden of Edinnu, a word which means plain. Inthis garden, according to the hymn, you would find the god, Ea. Howshort a step this is to Adam and Eve and the Garden of Eden in theBible. The Sumer depiction of the Garden of Edinnu even included asnake curled around a tree. The Garden of Edinnu and its recycledversion, the Garden of Eden, are highly symbolic of what washappening from the later Atlantis period and is still happening today."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"11Adam and Eve (symbolising Earth Man and Woman) were told not toeat from the tree of knowledge. In other words, they were to be keptin ignorance so that they would not learn of their true nature. This isa theme which has continued throughout human history up to thepresent day. I call it ‘the Mushroom Approach’ - keep them in thedark and feed them bulishit.According to William Bramley, in his book The Gods of Eden, theserpent in the Adam and Eve story is symbolic of something calledthe Brotherhood of the Snake (or serpent) which he believes was setup to give spiritual knowledge to an ignorant humanity by those whowished to help them. Bramley’s research leads him to suggest that the‘god’ known as Ea, or Prince of Earth, by the Sumerians who helpedto create and genetically engineer the new human form, did not wishto see them mentally, spiritually, and physically imprisoned. He didsome less-than-advisable things himself, Bramley believes, but hewas genuine in his desire to challenge this oppression. Unfortunately,the highly negative, Lucifer-controlled ETs were so hostile to thisthat the serpent or snake became synonymous with evil and Ea, the‘Prince of the Earth’ became known as the Prince of Darkness. It wasnothing more or less than the kind of character assassination, fuelledby lies and propaganda, which we see going on all the time in themodern world.Those who have read the Adam and Eve story will recall that theserpent, symbolic of Ea, in Bramley’s view, did not have theopportunity to persuade them to eat from another tree, the Tree ofLife. He was stopped. William Bramley believes that theBrotherhood of the Snake was eventually taken over by the negativeETs and used for their own purposes - to keep the knowledge secretfrom the mass of the people and to pass it on only to an elite whocould be trusted to support the ‘great work’ of world control anddomination. These would be natural leaders of the people, such askings and priests, in the civilisations that would follow Atlantis. Theaim was to disconnect the conscious level of our being from ourhigher levels to such an extent that our Earth consciousness would betrapped in the dense physical world and be unable to escape andevolve. Eternal slaves is what they wished to create according toBramley. I don’t know if his interpretations of the Sumer stories arecorrect in detail, but I have no problem with the idea of an ETinvolvement on Earth during Atlantis and before. I have longbelieved that extra-terrestrials seeded the present human form. This is"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"12where the different races originally came from, with their manycolours and features. Those ETs seeking to help humanity to advancehave been seeding human bodies in order to make geneticimprovements and to make it easier for the spirit to express its fullpotential. Put simply, the human form has been subjected to a sort ofgenetic tug-of-war. I also feel that an organisation, which I will callthe Brotherhood, has been used over thousands of years tomanipulate the human race, and never more so than today.The extreme negativity which prevailed on the Earth in the latterperiods of Atlantis had other implications. Every living form has anenergy system, a web of lines linking with the chakras to maintainthe flow of lifeforce energies. Acupuncture is based on thisunderstanding. Its practitioners call the lines meridians and the samesystem applies to planets. A planet has chakras and a grid of energylines known, depending on your preference, as meridians, ley lines ordragon lines. If you damage and disrupt this energy grid enough youcan destroy a planet in the same way that a human body dies when itsenergy system is sufficiently imbalanced. The basis of acupuncture isto keep the human system in harmony and the physical body healthy.Acupuncture needles are employed to rebalance and redirect the flowof energy. There are certain points, known as acupuncture points,where this can be done most efficiently. So it is with the Earth.Misuse of knowledge began to threaten this energy grid. ThoseAtlanteans who were still holding on to the values that brought themhere were guided by the higher levels to turn down the power of theenergies flowing through and around the planet. The more powerfulthe energies, the greater was the potential for creation or, should theybe misused, for catastrophe. Most Atlanteans were, by now, out ofcontrol and the only way to prevent them from destroying the Earthwas to reduce the power and potential of the energies available tothem. The spacecraft that come to the planet use these energy linesfor their power and, if the power is reduced, you reduce the potentialfor harnessing that power for negative reasons. A piece of channelledinformation I used in my book Truth Vibrations explained it like this:“In the Atlantean period there were many energies being used andinformation and knowledge being used which were for particularreasons of safety withdrawn, shall we say, to prevent completecatastrophe, to prevent total destruction of your planet. One could saythese were sort of emergency measures, if you like, to prevent the"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"13inhabitants of this planet from an untimely destruction”.I believe that the story of King Arthur and Merlin is, at least in part,a symbolic tale of this turning-down of the energies. I feel these talesrelate to Atlanteans and only became legends of knights and kingsmuch later when these kind of stories would have been more readilyunderstood by those they were designed to inform. This also applies tomany of the stories in ancient texts which became the Bible. The KingArthur story was, you might say, a sort of parable. The swordExcalibur, I feel, is symbolic of the turning off of those powerfulenergies - the ‘dragon energies’ as some people call them. Legend hasit that the sword (the energies) was fixed into a stone and only oneperson had the gifts to remove it. Put another way, only someone withthe correct energy pattern can unlock the vibratory key to release theenergies which have lain dormant since Atlantis. This process ishappening today. ‘Excalibur’ is being removed and unleashed acrossthe planet. This is being done primarily in Britain and Ireland becausethis was where the big switch-off was achieved all those thousands ofyears ago. However, many other locations on the planet are involved,too. The Earth’s energy field is now being prepared for its imminentevolution to a higher frequency as the period of Luciferic opportunitycomes to an end. The channelled explanation went on:“As in your human body, there are energy lines around your planet,through your planet, which correspond, I suppose, very much to theacupuncture lines and meridians in your body. where two lines cross,you create a vortex, a tiny vortex it’s two. The more lines thatintersect, the bigger the vortex. Therefore when you have a chakrayou have a large vortex of intersecting energy. It is the same with yourplanet. Where most lines cross there is the biggest vortex. Now youcould say that the plexus (network) in and around the Islands you callthe British Isles is the hub of the wheel of plexuses and energies whichsurround your planet. It has acted in other times like a fail-safedevice. In order to activate these chakric points upon your planet, theenergies must all pass through the central point. They must passthrough the heart of the pattern.”The number of those who had the knowledge of this central pointand how to close it down were very few. The keys to this point were“a consciousness pattern, a series of harmonic equations, known"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"14only to the keepers of that pattern.”My belief is that the energies that were switched off, or at leastmassively turned down, were, in part, the Earth’s kundalini energies.These energies in the base chakra, often symbolised by the snake,serpent or dragon, are a seat of our power. The Atlanteans knew howto work with this power but, as with all things, power can be usedconstructively or destructively. In their later days they chosedestruction and the source of their power had to be removed. Thesuppressing of the kundalini flow obviously had great emotional,physical and mental effects on the Earth as a physical and spiritualentity and the power and knowledge within her aura (the energies welive within and are part of) was consequently diminished. Inevolutionary terms, the Earth Spirit and humanity went backwards.At the time that Yeva channelled the information about humanitygiving the Luciferic Consciousness the chance to re-balance itself,she was also shown a symbolic vision of how this has affected humanevolution. She saw the energy stream ofevolution going forwards andthen suddenly turning back on itself before returning to the startingpoint, so completing a large loop. It is within that symbolic loop thatthe period of Luciferic opportunity has unfolded. We are now comingback to the point where it all began in terms of our evolution. Whenthe loop is complete, the period of opportunity will be over and wewill continue our evolution without the extreme negative influence ofthe Luciferic disrujption.Once the harmonic ‘key’ was turned at the end of Atlantis, thepower no longer existed for the imbalanced Atlanteans to destroyeverything. The vibratory rate fell and the density of the planetincreased. The Earth was falling down the wavelengths ofconsciousness and disconnecting from a powerful link with higherlevels of being. With every fall, the levels of understanding,knowledge and wisdom available to the human race werecorrespondingly reduced. This, for me, is what is really meant by theFall of Man. It is the fall down the frequencies of knowledge andwisdom into denser matter. As the fall continued, humanity ‘forgot’about Atlantis because we were falling further and further away inconsciousness terms from the frequency on which all that happened.With the frequencies rising today, we will be remembering more andmore about Atlantis as the fall is reversed and Earth’s kundalini andother energies are re-released.The behaviour of the Atlanteans and the efforts of the Luciferic"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"15Consciousness so affected the Earth’s energy field that Atlantis wassunk in stages by colossal earthquakes, volcanoes and tidal waves. Itcould well be that at least the final cataclysms were caused by arebalancing beam passing across the Earth, which I will explain morefully in a moment. The effect of this ‘photon beam’, as some peoplecall it, is to rebalance energy fields. If an energy field isfundamentally out of balance the rebalancing process can createstaggering physical and mental effects. I’m sure that some kind ofnuclear war broke out, too, and that the Earth was also hit during thedestruction of Atlantis by a large piece of debris, possibly part of theremains of Maldek. The energies are electromagnetic and differentenergy fields attract or repel each other. Like attracts like in thesecircumstances. So, if the Earth’s energy field goes through a highlynegative phase, it is more likely to attract to itself other negativefields - like the debris careering around the galaxy. I feel that, amongthe planets, at least the Moon and Venus have ‘gone walkabout’before dropping into their present orbits. This would clearly havecaused fantastic upheavals as they shattered the balance within theenergy fields of other planets and star systems. This series ofincredible geological events in several distinct phases caused, nodoubt, by a variety of reasons, ended the civilisation called Atlantis.Researchers have found evidence of a 10,000ft uplift in the Andesabout ten thousand years ago. This is because whole mountain rangessoared from the surface of the Earth during these periods. There wasa magnetic pole shift and a tilt of the Earth on its axis. This sent afantastic tidal wave around the planet. The giant crystal at the centreof the Atlantean power system was lost under the ocean and it is thiswhich might be creating the strange phenomenon known as theBermuda Triangle. From time to time, it might open a gateway fromone dimension to another. Other planets of this solar system whichwere highly imbalanced went through similar upheavals and all hellbroke loose across a wide area. It seems to me that the Earth fell outof alignment, in some way, with the universal energy grid.The turning down of the energy points and the vibratory ‘fall’trapped the Atlantean consciousness within the Earth’s frequenciesand many who could have escaped chose, for various reasons, to stayand carry on the work. To do this, they had to begin the cycle ofincarnating from the Earth’s non-physical frequencies into the humanform. This process included the volunteers who were still on the pathand those who had either been led astray by the Luciferic"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"16Consciousness or were aspects of that consciousness. Othervolunteers could not stand the falling frequencies and left before itwas too late. The Earth’s vibration and atmosphere became muchdenser it was too late. The Earth’s vibration and atmosphere becamemuch denser and the light/dark struggle would manifest in a differentway. I am not sure exactly why, but from now on the ET presence onEarth, both negative and positive, would take another form. Most oftheir influence was felt by affecting human consciousness by plantingideas, beliefs, and thought patterns. I do think that they still came intheir spacecraft to observe, support, or manipulate depending on theirstate of being, but it was mostly done in much more subtle ways andwas very different from the Atlantis and pre-Atlantis times. Since theend of Atlantis, those who continued to work for the evolution of theplanet and humanity have been incarnating to spread the spiritualtruths and prepare the World for today’s great time of change. As achannelled communication said:“There are many of you for whom the Earth is not your indigenousevolutionary home, shall we say. There are many of you on this planetwho come from other spheres of evolution. I think these have beencalled ‘5tar children’ by some of your writers, that is a good enoughexpression. More evolved beings came to your planet and manifestedon your planet in Atlantean times. This was the biggest impulse inbringing the new knowledge into Atlantis which caused it to grow intothe civilisation that it was. New knowledge was brought into thissystem from universal sources from highly evolved spirits, bringingknowledge into the planet. And you‘re going to bring it back,basically.”A plan was set in motion to restore the Earth after Atlantis. Thisplan had three main motivations:To help the Luciferic Consciousness to re-harmonise before its‘opportunity’ period came to an end,To seek to protect human consciousness from further imbalance,To check the fall of the Earth’s energy field to ever lowervibrations.This final point is crucial to what is happening on the planet today.Creation is self-balancing. You can push it out of balance for acertain period but then it kicks back to find harmony. This loop ofopportunity for the Luciferic consciousness had a definite time scale"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"17and now, in the lifetimes of our generations, it is coming to a close. Itis time for Planet Earth to return to its original evolutionary road.Everything from the inside of an atom to a universe is in orbitaround a central point. Some researchers believe that our solarsystem, together with a much wider area, is in orbit around the starsystem known as the Pleiades. According to the writer Paul OttoHesse, this orbit is centred in particular around Alcyone, the brighteststar in the Pleiades. Some people say it takes 24,000 years for our sunto complete such an orbit. Hesse believes that it is from Alcyone andthe Pleiades that the photon beam I have mentioned is projected. It isa beam of highly charged energy particles that rebalances and re-synchronises all energy fields that pass through it. I use the termPhoton Beam for simplicity, but that term, and the location ofAlcyone, are Hesse’s research, not mine. I know it only as asynchronisation beam and have no idea of its exact composition norfrom where it emanates. But the effect is the same:Fantastic transformation.As the beam is a circle, each orbit of our solar system aroundAlcyone (if that is correct) takes us through the beam twice. It isestimated that it takes around 2,000 years to pass completely throughit. No matter what state of imbalance a planet may be experiencing,the passage through the photon beam will re-balance it at thevibratory level most appropriate to its evolution. The vital point,however, is that the more imbalanced a planet’s energy field is whenit enters that beam, the more disruption and upheaval will be causedin the re-balancing process. It is that potentially cataclysmicupheaval that the Volunteer consciousness has been trying to avoidby working to check the gathering imbalances caused by theLuciferic consciousness. You can see, given the potentialconsequences, what an act of love it has been for the human mind tooffer this opportunity to that consciousness.The planet has already experienced the great upheaval whichmarked the end of Atlantis and it could happen again if we don’tflood the Earth’s energy field with love. The photon beam acts as asort of harvester, giving the opportunity to those who are ready tomove out of this level of existence to graduate to a higher one.During the Atlantean period it re-balanced the Earth’s energy field.The Earth, while being rebalanced, did not herself take that"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"18THE PLEIDIAN SYSTEM: Alcyone is the brightest star in the constellation ofPleiades. Our sun takes 24,000 years to complete a full revolution around Alcyone."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"19evolutionary leap because it was not the right time. She could nothave done so, anyway, with her energy field weakened by theswitching off of certain key energy flows. Now the time is right forthe Earth to make that evolutionary step and return to where she wasbefore the Luciferic opportunity period began. In other words, theevolutionary ‘loop’ is being completed and the Earth is returning toher original evolutionary path. I think the same is true of the solarsystem and further afield. The Luciferic opportunity is coming to aclose. The pass across the photon beam which is happening now will,I feel, be potentially more far-reaching in its effect than it was evenduring Atlantis. This time the whole energy field of Planet Earth isbeing ‘harvested’ and it is taking a massive step up in its evolution.Anyone who does not do the same will not be able to incarnate on theEarth after this process is complete because the Earth will beoperating on too high a frequency for them to exist here until theyhave raised their own vibrations to match those of this planet.The idea of this re-balancing beam was identified by the Mayapeople more than a thousand years ago. When the Mayan Civilisationwas at the height of its powers in Central America between around435AD and 850AD, they were well ahead of today’s mainstreamscience in their understanding of Creation. This was because they,too, were, in part, an incarnation of the advanced volunteerconsciousness. They would have channelled other frequencies andpossibly interacted with space visitors. They knew of these beamcycles crossing the Earth and produced a system,of numbers andsymbols to measure these periods. According to the calculations theMaya left behind on their magnificent pyramids and temples, thecurrent ‘great cycle’ of the Earth’s evolution began in 31 13Bc andwill end in the year 2012. This corresponds with the prophecies ofothers such as Nostradamus who foresaw enormous change in thisperiod, as one era of human evolution passed and another made itsentrance.The year 2012 is when those who follow the Mayan calculationsbelieve that Planet Earth will be re-synchronised. Different peopleput different time scales on these things, but they all agree on thebasic period. My feeling is that the ‘window’ of time in which wewill see the most dramatic change is between the 1990s and circa2030. I will give more details of the effects of this period when wereach the present day in our chronological story. I felt it was worthmapping out the basic themes, however, at this early stage because it"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"20will help to put into context much of what our story will describe. Allover the Universe are other highly-evolved civilisations working tohelp humanity and the Earth. Some of their number come intoincarnation, others travel here in spacecraft, and still others operateas channelled communicators to Earth people. These othercivilisations have evolved to the point where they can think asindividuals or link their minds collectively, so accessing all theknowledge and wisdom available in the sum total of the parts.Guiding the overall operation is a Galactic and UniversalConsciousness which is given many names by channellers. This is theconsciousness which is guiding the Earth and those in incarnationwho are here to serve the Universe by serving humanity and theplanet. That consciousness will, in turn, be guided by the Source.Against this line-up of love, however, are aspects of the Lucifericconsciousness which also manifest in physical bodies, ETs, and aschannelled communicators. These are guided by their version of aUniversal consciousness which is in opposition to the Source andseeks to undermine the efforts of all those who wish to open theprison door for both humanity and the Earth. For many thousands ofyears, the evolution of Planet Earth has been dominated by thestruggle between these two states of being, harmony and disharmony.Thanks to the re-balancing beam there can be only one winner -harmony. But this does not diminish the horrors which disharmonyhas visited, and will, for some little time longer, continue to visitupon the world."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"212Collective AmnesiaThe Earth took a long time to recover from the cataclysms and, evenwhen the physical surface began to heal, it was now a very differentworld.Gone was the knowledge that built Atlantis, because the frequencyof consciousness that could be accessed on Earth was much lowerand more primitive than it had been. The energy field had been re-balanced but the energies had come to rest, as it were, at a muchlower frequency than they had once enjoyed. In vibratory terms itwas like incarnating into treacle. It was even more difficult for thosehighly-evolved minds who were still working for the restoration ofthe planet to manifest that understanding while encased in a densephysical body. Their bodies were now denser than they had been inAtlantis and the limitations were subsequently greater than they hadbeen used to. The power and potential of the energies around theplanet were similarly curtailed. All this made the task of thoseincarnating to help the Earth immeasurably more demanding.The events at the end of Atlantis had attracted large numbers ofbeings to this area of Creation to help with the plan. The Earth’senergy field had to be prepared for the next crossing of the photonbeam when it would return to its original evolutionary level andbeyond. Other volunteers began to incarnate on to the Earth. But thisdense physical frequency and many others continued to be dominatedby the Luciferic disruption. That consciousness as expressed throughnegative ETs had been largely removed from the physical level of theplanet by the rebalancing process but now it began to stimulatedisharmony again. The lower frequency made this easier, if anything,and disharmony in the planet’s energy field gathered pace as theLuciferic consciousness entered the last stage of its ‘opportunity’period - an opportunity it showed no signs of taking. I once had avision of the Earth which took the form of a ball of glass like the"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"22ones you see hanging from the ceiling in discos and dance halls. Asthe ball spun, it was reflecting light in all directions. I believe thiswas symbolic of the role the Earth plays. But, instead of sending outlight and love, she has been generating negative energy. She hasbecome like a negativity production unit which is imbalancing andholding back the evolution of the solar system and all that iscurrently entering the photon beam and preparing to evolve. This isbeing made more difficult by the drag and disharmony of the Earthand the frequencies that surround her. This is creating vibratorypressures and tensions which are reaching a critical point. One pieceof channelled information I used in Truth Vibrations said:The Universe needs the life the Earth brings forth and the wholemust be preserved. It is not for you alone that we do this work. Therehas always been an order in the way the planets have been governed.Man has not understood the linkages which bind everything together.”This is another reason why the Volunteer consciousness is focusingon Planet Earth. What happens here affects a much wider area. Allplanets and stars are connected by a web of energy lines to auniversal grid. If a chakra or pulse point on this grid is damaged orstarts to generate imbalanced energies, it affects everythingconnected to that grid. These can eventually affect other frequenciesand the imbalance can grow like a cancer. It has become clear to meover these years of my spiritual reawakening that, if the Earth goeson being abused, so much negative energy will be created that theconsequences for the wider Universe could be very unpleasant as itgoes through its evolutionary leap.The imbalances and density of the Earth affect humanity in manyways. It is worth repeating here that not all of our consciousnessincarnates into a physical body and becomes subject to its severelimitations. The higher levels of our consciousness (higher self) stayon a non-physical level and guide the lower self through anincarnation. The higher self knows the lifeplan - what we hope toachieve and experience during that life. If, however, we lose touchwith the higher self, Mission Control, we become dominated by theinformation coming in through the eyes and the ears and we are preyto the thought patterns directed at this level by the Lucifericconsciousness. These work particularly on the emotions and the egoand, once the Lucifer patterns have control of those, they can, by"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"23affecting our behaviour, cause untold pain and destruction. This iswhat has happened to the human race. We can come into incarnationwith the best of intentions but, once we look out through our eyesand become subjected to all the information this level constantlybombards us with, we can forget why we are here and act in waysthat are the exact opposite of what we intended before incarnation.This is especially so if the kundalini energies are suppressed because,in that state of being, the other chakras are not linked powerfully tothe physical level. Thus, the physical is not fully connected to ourhigher levels. (The source of the kundalini energy is the base of thespine, the seat of our sexuality and of harmonious relationship.)It can be even worse if a higher self is working from one of thenon-physical frequencies still dominated by that Lucifericconsciousness. In these cases, you have a misguided lower self and amisguided higher self. There are also direct incarnations of theLucifer consciousness. Look back through history and around theworld today and you will see many examples of this. The imbalancesof the Earth, its density and a suppressed or imbalanced kundaliniflow, make the connection and communication between higher andlower self much more difficult during an incarnation. With theinfluence of ‘Mission Controls’ getting weaker, lower selves comeunder the control of eyes and ears information. If Lucifer canmanipulate that information and fill the human mind with negativethought patterns, it follows that he could encourage humanity to actin ways that generate yet more negative energy into the ocean ofconsciousness in which we exist. More negative energy increases thepower of the Luciferic Consciousness. We can feel these energieswhen we meet someone and say, ‘Hey, I got bad vibes from him’. Or,perhaps, we go into a house and say, ‘I don’t like it in here - it’seerie’. At these times we are feeling the non-physical energygenerated by a person or by others in the past. What we callatmosphere is really the energy, negative or positive, generated byhuman beings or non-physical entities. The atmosphere we describeat football matches, for instance, is made up of the energies generatedby the crowd.Since the end of Atlantis, the imbalances have been fuelled both bythe thought patterns transmitted by the Luciferic consciousness andby the negative energies generated by humanity. As a result, the Earthhas become subjected to an ever more serious negative imbalancewhich has led to the state of the world we see today. Lucifer has"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"24sought to control the information and thought patterns of the densephysical level to such an extent that whoever incarnated on to theEarth would become subjected to those patterns and to the influenceof the people already affected by them. A simple example of this iscan be found in parents controlled or strongly influenced by theLucifer thought patterns who indoctrinate their children to think inthe same way. Once control of the human mind has been largelyaccomplished at the collective level, each successive generation hasfaced pressure to conform to that way of thinking.Every species has, as I have outlined, a collective mind, a level towhich all minds in incarnation are linked. It has been shown that,once a certain number of a species learns to do something new,suddenly other members of the same species are able to do the samething without being shown. This so-called ‘Hundredth MonkeySyndrome’ is the collective mind at work. Once enough individualminds start thinking in a particular way, their thought patternsbecome strong enough in the collective mind for other individuals toaccess that information. That’s how the Hundredth MonkeySyndrome works. With Lucifer transmitting thought patterns into thecollective mind and using billions of dense physical bodies over thecenturies to do the same, it is not difficult to see how the illusionsand misunderstandings of humanity have arisen and become sopowerful.There were three tasks which those who had come to the Earthneeded to perform in order to restore harmony. One was to create atemporary energy grid on the planet to replace the one devastatedduring Atlantis; the second was to restore and re-open that Atlantisenergy system when the time was right and re-awaken the closed-down energies before the Earth’s evolutionary leap during thepresent pass of the photon beam; and the third was to givehumanity as much information as possible to help them toremember who they really were and what they had come to do. If itwas difficult for humanity’s higher selves to communicate withthem, this problem could be by-passed, to some extent, by usingthose who did maintain a good connection to bring informationdirectly to this dense physical level. Also, everyone who changedtheir thinking in the light of this information would be sendingthought patterns into the collective mind to challenge the Luciferdomination.These efforts were made more difficult by the way the frequency"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"25had fallen and the nature of the imbalances it was subject to. On thisfrequency were negative emotions and mental states of a scale andseverity that these evolved volunteers had never experienced directlybefore. If the personnel were to be capable of playing their part inthose generations at the end of the 20th century, they had to havemastered, to a large extent, the emotions, temptations, illusions andfears so prevalent on the Earth. If they did not, they would be unableto do what was required and the transition period would be evenmore traumatic and difficult than it already promised to be. As wellas coming into incarnation to pass on information and work on theenergy grid, these beings also had to be put through lives that wouldgive them experience of some very unpleasant emotions. Only in thisway could they learn to overcome them. Sometimes they would havelives in which they worked almost exclusively on the energy systemand on the spreading of information; sometimes they would havelives designed primarily to experience negative emotions andovercome them. Mostly their lives were a combination of both.Over the thousands of years since the destruction of Atlantis, thoseworking for the restoration of the planet have been incarnating overand over again and, in that process, have been amassing karmic debtwhich has had to be balanced out. Some became so affected by thepressures of this level that they no longer followed the path they hadembarked upon after Atlantis. They came to free the prisoners andended up in jail themselves, trapped by the pressures and desires ofthe dense physical world and undermined by the Lucifericconsciousness which seeks to stop the volunteers, in particular. Mostof them have been historically anonymous, living simple lives andbeing guided to work on the energy system. Many of the great stonecircles and the standing stones of the world were built either by, orunder the direction of, these people. Pyramids and the stones are thephysical manifestation of the work that went on thousands of yearsago to construct a sort of makeshift energy grid to keep the Earthticking over until the Atlantean one could be reactivated in ourlifetimes. They would have sensed the energies and been guided todo what was required because the energy imbalances at that timewere not as great as they would later become and the connection withthe higher self would have been potentially more powerful. Alsoevery effort is made by other levels to make the higher self/lower selfconnection of certain key people as strong as it can possibly be whenparticular particular tasks must be achieved."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"26Pyramid geometry is such that it has a very significant effect onenergy flows, negative or positive depending on how they are used,while the stone circles and standing stones act like fuse boxes andacupuncture needles receiving energies from the universal grid andrebalancing the flows. If you look back at any civilisation which wasmore evolved than the rest of the world, you will be looking at eithera group incarnation of those who volunteered to help the Earth or atthe effects of spaceship landings or channelled information whichpassed on the knowledge. That doesn’t mean that the volunteers wereperfect. They were subject to the pressures of this world, also. Andwhat is perfect, anyway? But they were in close enoughsynchronisation with their higher self for knowledge to reach thislevel which helped the earth and human understanding.When I say that the volunteer consciousness incarnated into certaincivilisations, I don’t meaii that every member of that nation or racewas that consciousness incarnate. Only some of them. These were theones who accessed the information and understanding from higherlevels which either helped those civilisations to evolve very quicklyor challenged the political, economic and religious dogma of theirday. Around them there would have been people who ignored them orkilled them for their ‘heresy’ as well as those who listened andsupported their views on how a society could best prosper in peace.That is the situation in its most simplistic form. But, of course, it ismore complex than that. Some of the volunteer consciousness hasbecome imbalanced and is either not working for the good of theplanet or is actively working against it. Some of the Lucifericconsciousness will have been so affected by its experiences that ithas rejected that negative influence. In most cases, people areaffected by both. No-one is all good or all negative. The question iswhich part of us is dominating our behaviour and to what degree?Extra-terrestrials continued to come to the Earth in this post-Atlantis period, and were considered to be gods by the Earth people.This is not surprising when you imagine what it must have been likefor the primitive Earth people to be confronted by spacecraft andtheir occupants. We should not underestimate the scale of theinfluence on human evolution on all levels, positive and negative, byother civilisations in the Universe. When you look through the Bibleand other ancient texts you can see what appear to be spacecraftdescribed. The Book of Ezekiel is a prime example and, indeed, thereis an analysis of this called The Space Ships Of Ezekiel by Josef F."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"27Blumrich, a former chief of systems layout at NASA. His workstrongly suggests that a number of biblical texts are describingspacecraft. Analysis of many ancient writings and the artwork ofpeoples all over the world also appears to contain de scriptions ofsuch craft and their occupants, who were thought to be ‘gods fromthe sky’. Ancient Indian Sanskrit texts speak of gods who fought inaircraft and certainly the Book of Ezekiel leaves you in little doubt ofwhat was being described:“Now as I looked upon the living creatures, I saw four wheels uponthe ground, one by each ofthe living creatures, with their four faces.The appearance of the wheels and their composition was like thecolour of shiny amber; and all four wheels had one likeness; andtheir appearance and their composition was like a wheel in themiddle of a wheel...“And when the living creatures went, the wheels went with them;and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, thewheels were lifted up.“And the appearance of the sky upon the heads of the livingcreatures was reflected as the colour of the terrible crystal stretchedover their heads above...“And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like thenoise of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, like the din of anarmy. When they stood still, they lowered their wings. And there wasa voice from the crystal covering that was over their heads when theystood and had let down their wings.”Ezekiel 1:1-25The Babylonians had a god called Oannes, a fishtailed amphibiousbeing who, according to their legends, came to Earth to start acivilisation. Some people look at the primitive way of life on theplanet during these periods and laugh at the idea of highly-evolvedspacecraft landing here. But people from the computerised,technological, western culture today visit parts of the world that stilllive more or less as the ancients did. No-one finds that funny or hardto accept. The only difference between that and what I am suggestingabout spacecraft is that, in the extra-terrestrial case, the technologicalculture visiting a more primitive one is interplanetary rather thanintercontinental.We will pick up the story of what happened to humanity after"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"28Atlantis in the fertile land between the Euphrates and Tigris riversaround 4,OOOBC. This area became known as Mesopotamia and isnow Iraq. Here the Sumerian people settled and were supported byvisitations from many extra-terrestrial peoples, some to help, some toexploit. The Sumerians were said to have built the first cities of thepost-Atlantis era, but there were many other civilisations before that.One was in Israel, around Jericho, for sure. According to theSumerian records preserved on baked bricks, they themselves cameto the area with a knowledge of writing, the arts, agriculture andmetalwork. I am sure that the knowledge contained in their writingsand artifacts came to them from earlier civilisations that historyhasn’t yet recorded. The Sumerians used their agricultural skills andthe rich silt left by the rivers in times of flood, to grow two crops ofwheat each year. A culture developed that was, as far as we know,well ahead of most of the planet at that time. A library of more than30,000 written tablets was created and the discovery of some of thesehas given us an understanding of the Sumerian background andhistory. Some of the symbols found on Sumerian artifacts correspondwith those in the crop circles that appear in the fields of southernEngland and elsewhere today.The two main cities of Mesopotamia were Eridu, the capital ofSumer, and Nippur to the North, the capital of Akkad, which wasinhabited by a Semitic race. The two cities had very differentreligious beliefs and cultures. Eridu worshipped the God, Ea, whileEn4il was the God of Nippur. Later the Arabian word, Allah, woulddevolve from En4il, as would the Hebrew word for God, El, who wasalso to become the Christian God. I have no doubt that Ea and En-lilwere extra-terrestrials from that earlier period we talked about. Bynow they had entered Sumerian legends as ‘gods’. Extra-terrestrialsand the psychic channellings and visions which people experiencedwere the foundations of the religions that would follow, right up tothe present day. Not all the gods came from these sources. Some werejust made up or the product of confused minds but most were ET orpsychic in their origins.Look at the implications for the Bible and other ‘holy’ books ofthe themes emerging in our story so far. The judgmental god sowidely quoted in the Old Testament and other ancient texts, whothreatens to bring horrors upon human beings if they don’t do as hetells them, merely reflects the attitudes of the negative ETs orchannelled entities. They are not the words of God but those of the"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"29extra-terrestrials and channelled entities who were thought to begods. Go to church and worship an ET! The idea that God createdhumans in his own image would describe perfectly the seeding ofthe human form as we know it by extra-terrestrials considered to begods.I stress here that, when truths were passed on, they werecommunicated in ways which the people of the time couldunderstand. From the symbolic explanations of thousands of yearsago have come the religious dogmas as the symbolism has been takenliterally and added to or changed around. When ancient texts sayclearly, ‘This story is a parable’, religions accept the tale as symbolicbut many take everything else in the text literally. In fact, most ofthese texts are symbolic and told in parable form. I use a lot ofsymbolic explanations in my books which relate to what people todayexperience and easily identify with. It has always been like that. Sothere are still truths in the Bible and many other ancient texts despitewhat the religions have done to destroy and debase them. But thesetruths and the mathematical codes they also contain will never beunderstood if they continue to be taken literally rather thansymbolically; nor while the religions continue to proclaim thateverything written in them is one hundred per cent accurate and theinfallible word of God when a goodly proportion is clearly inventedclaptrap passed on from one people to another through the centuries.Religious dogma and myth have been used very successfully eitherto suppress understanding or to twist the truth sufficiently to turnsomething positive into something negative. The story of Adam andEve is an example. It has been used to undermine women (Evetempts Adam in the story to eat from the Tree of Knowledge againstthe command of God, and so evil starts with the creation of women).It has also been used to justify the belief that we are all born sinners(our ancestral lines are all supposed to go back genetically to theoriginal ‘sinners’, Adam and Eve). This nonsense is still blindlyfollowed today to justify some terrible behaviour. My goodness. Godhelp us!To weave a way through this minefield we have to look at thesymbolism in the Sumerian stories and other ancient texts but nottake them all literally. Even the symbolism is multi-dimensional. Idon’t believe the symbolism of the snake, for example, relatesentirely to the Garden of Edinnu or Eden. I feel that the snake orserpent has been used as a symbol for many things. The"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"30Mesopotamian culture had a serpent-god called Ningishzidarepresented by two intertwining snakes. These are possibly symbolicof the two opposing forces, positive-negative, male-female, inbalance within the kundalini energy as it rises through the centralchannel to connect and empower the chakras on the physical level.Appropriately, though somewhat ironically, the symbol of themedical profession to this day is the two intertwining snakes knownas the caduceus. The symbol of modern medicine representsknowledge of the physical body and the human energy field knownthousands of years ago, but now rejected by the very professionwhich has that knowledge in its symbol!Serpents and similar symbols have also been used throughoutancient cultures to represent the Goddess or female polarity ofCreation. The earlier concepts of the Trinity had a female symbol asone of the triangle of’gods’ while the more enlightened religionsspeak of a Father/Mother God to highlight the need for male-femalebalance within both ourselves and the whole. The Christian versionof this idea of a Trinity - Father, Son and Holy Ghost -does notrecognise the feminine and that has been reflected in its attitude towomen over the centuries. All the ancient and more spirituallyenlightened cultures like the Sumerians, the Egyptians, the Greeks,the native Americans (Indians), the Australian aborigines and manyof the East, knew of the importance of the kundalini and hadinitiations, often very tough ones, to speed the smooth activation andempowerment of these energies. The snake and serpent were, moreoften than not, a representation of this. Similarly, their belief inresurrection or rebirth was often symbolised by the snake sheddingits skin as it moved from one state of being into another.There were some periods of peace in Sumer, but it was alsoplagued by inter-city battles and, gradually, the civilisation decayedand disappeared. This was to be a running theme through humanevolution - the desire to impose beliefs or to steal the benefits of anadvanced culture, causing war after war and, thereby, destroyingwhat human ingenuity and the volunteer consciousness had created.It is also the case, as we will discuss more thoroughly later, that ifyou wish to control people and stop them evolving spiritually thencausing conflict between them is an excellent way to achieve thataim. The culture of the Sumerians was to influence others who beganto develop in the region we call the Middle East. Sumerian beliefsand knowledge found their way to the Egyptians, Babylonians,"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"31Assyrians, Hebrews and, later, the Greeks. In turn, the Greeks wouldinfluence the Romans and the Sumerians could fairly be said to havebeen the foundation of much that would follow. Writing and sucharchitectural constructions as the arch and the dome first appear withthe Sumerians in the post-Atlantis period although these probably goback further to preSumer times. The Hebrews inherited many of theirown beliefs from Mesopotamia and Egypt and these have beenpassed on through the generations as Judaism and, eventually,Christianity. The idea of the Sabbath comes from the Sumerians asdoes the Great Flood, the Fall of Man and the laws that have beenassociated with Moses. One Sumerian tablet records the story ofCreation which, in all its main themes, is the same as that reported inGenesis.The God myths, largely, though not entirely, the result of ET andpsychic activities, were already well underway by Sumer times.Another Sumerian tablet tells the story of Bel, which means the Sonof God. Bel was to become the saviour-myth figure of Babylon andwould be known to the Hebrews as Baal. Bel, the Sumerian son ofGod was the Lord Christ and redeemer in Babylonian thought. Theybelieved he had died and risen again to ensure their salvation. Heardthat somewhere before? The Babylonians performed a Passion dramaand sang hymns that were very close to the Passion plays andservices of the later Christians. Bel was the second in a trinity ofgods - Ea, the Father; Bel, the Son, and Anu, the Holy Spirit. It wasthe custom to sacrifice a lamb to the gods because, as one tablet says,“The lamb is the substitute for humanity.” What is it that the Bibletells us? “...the Lamb of God which taketh away the sins of theworld.”The ‘lamb’ of the Bible is said to be Jesus, but that’s just a piece ofmyth-recycling. The basic story of Bel and other key elements of thisSumerian and Babylonian belief-system were taken back to Judea bythe Jews after they were freed from captivity in Babylon. They thenfound their way into the texts that make up the Old Testament and,through them, into the New Testament. So we have the Bible talkingofJesus as the Lamb of God dying so that our sins can be forgiven or,as they were saying thousands of years earlier in Mesopotamia duringtheir animal sacrifices, ‘The Lamb is the substitute for humanity’.One Sumerian tablet even records the story of how Sargon, the Kingof the Semites, was hidden by his mother in a basket made frombulrushes on the bank of the Euphrates, a tale attributed in the Bible"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"32to Moses. As we will see, the whole basis of the Jewish, Christianand many other religions comes from stories inherited over thecenturies which each religion attributes to its own particular saviour-god. A number of these stories and myths will be symbolic of actualevents and eternal truths but their meaning, in most cases, hasbecome so changed, twisted or embellished that the understandinghas been lost.I am not sure how much direct ET involvement went on in Sumer. Iwant to see more information before I decide what I feel washappening. Obviously this part of the book, in terms of the ETinvolvement, has to be a hypothesis, although one based on muchresearch by a number of people. It is possible that ETs were stillmaking themselves known to the population as a whole, or it couldbe they were interacting only with certain groups or individuals. ButI don’t think it is as simple as ETs manifesting physically. I feel theyoperate mostly on other frequencies of reality which allow them to beseen only by those who can psychically tune into them. They wouldcertainly have been working through human consciousness andchannellers, I would say, and having a considerable influence onevents.What I do feel on the balance of the evidence I have seen and myown intuition, is that the principle of initiating people into the eternaltruths began to be misused from at least this Sumer period onwardsand probably much earlier. If you remember, the channelling in thelast chapter talked about the “Guardians of the Light” in Atlantisbeing given the knowledge of how to use and harness the energies.This knowledge was kept secret because of the potential fordevastation if it was misused. At that time this initiation process wasused with the best of intent. This process was, however, to becomeinfiltrated under the influence of the Luciferic Consciousness andslowly, but surely, it spawned the enormous network of secretsocieties we see today, all with similar terms, symbols, and initiationproceedures. This network I will call the Brotherhood.I stress here that I am not suggesting all secret societies from thismoment on were of negative, manipulative, intent. Many continuedto use the cover of secrecy in the centuries that followed, to pass onspiritual knowledge which was being systematically destroyed in theoutside world, and to speak openly about it would have beentantamount to suicide. The Brotherhood, where used to communicatethe spiritual truths for the good of humanity in line with its original"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"33purpose, has made a vital contribution to keeping those truths alivethrough some very dark times. So it is no contradiction that somegreat people who have served humanity well have been involved inBrotherhood secret societies, while the Brotherhood has also beenused to manipulate humanity appallingly. It depends who is in controlof the secret society at a particular time. What I most stronglycontend, however, is that from now onwards there was a gradualtakeover of the Brotherhood initiation process, until it became anoverwhelmingly negative influence on humanity and an enormouslyeffective vehicle for the Luciferic Consciousness. I shall be chartingthis takeover through the book and highlighting its fundamentaleffect today on everyone’s lives. The difference between the originalBrotherhood and the Luciferic version is one of intent and method.The original passed on truths, or what were genuinely perceived to betruths, to those it believed would use the knowledge wisely; theLuciferic version gives a twisted and manipulated version of thetruths to those it believes can be trusted to continue its ambitions tocontrol the world.The Sumerian civilisation expanded and the famous city of Ur wasbuilt around 3,500Bc. Later, an event of some kind occurred whichaltered the course of the Euphrates and forced the people to moveNorth to the river settlement known as Babylon, which means theGate of the Gods. Internal strife weakened them and eventually theAmorites conquered the region and brought together Sumer andAkkad to form Babylonia. The Amorites were a Semetic race, abranch of which became the Hebrews. King Hammurabi became theruler of what was to be known as Babylonia and he instigated asystem of laws and justice that were to be adapted for their own useby the Hebrews, Greeks, and Romans. Education was available to alland everyone had the opportunity to learn to read and write. Therewere libraries and universities.It is important to appreciate, as we look at where present-dayvalues and beliefs originated, that nothing is new. It is all inheritedfrom, or influenced by, what has happened in the past. To say that thebeliefs of Christianity were new 2,000 years ago is simply ridiculous.Even the Christian ceremony called the Eucharist, the eating of thebody and the drinking of the blood, originates from the days ofcannibalism. Today, Christians eat bread and drink red wine tosymbolise Christ’s body and blood. In the ceremonies from whichthis originated, they ate and drank the real thing in human and animal"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"34sacrifices! The Greeks called it the Eucharistia.The Assyrians travelled three hundred miles to the south to invadeand conquer Babylonia around 1280Bc and, over the next 200 yearsor so, they extended their empire across to the Mediterranean. After aperiod of internal war, the Assyrians invaded Egypt, but thiscampaign so exhausted them physically and financially that theywere conquered by the Chaldeans who moved their centre toBabylon. The best known of the Chaldean kings wasNebuchadnezzar who reigned from 604 to 561Bc and it was he whoinvaded through Judea to take command of Egypt. Jews were takencaptive and removed to Babylon where they were to have access tothe stories of Bel, the Son of God, and the other Mesopotamianbeliefs I have been talking about.The next conquerors on the scene were the Persians who tookBabylonia in 539Bc. The Jews believed these invaders had been sentby their God, Jehovah, to free them from captivity when, in fact, likeso many other peoples, the Persians merely wished to extend theirempire and steal all the booty they could find. The Jews hadsupported the Persians in their attack on Babylon and were allowedto return to Judea. They took with them the stories and beliefs theyhad heard in Babylon and this was to be a great influence on theemergence of both the Jewish and Christian religions. The Persianshad a belief in one God in contrast to the many-god religions thatabounded among those people who believed that different gods wereresponsible for every facet of nature and the many ET and other‘gods’ which became myth figures over the centuries. So, when allthose ‘gods’ became fused into the one God, he was an amalgamationof all those different myths and beliefs. No wonder the Bible is socontradictory.By 500Bc the Persians controlled an area from Egypt to the bordersof India. Communications improved with the building of the royalroad from near the Persian Gulf almost to the Aegean Sea and Greeksbegan to travel south to visit Babylon. There they heard the stories ofBel and others and met with people from India and Syria.

Thename means ‘black land’ and refers to the silt left by the floodingNile.Like Sumer, this civilisation grew from settlements alongside amajor river where the fertility of the soil would ensure that there wasenough to eat. Researchers believe the land was settled before3,000BC and developed into a system of Pharaoh dynasties anddictatorships. There are some who believe that extra-terrestrials werevery active in this region, at least in the early days, and while I wouldlike to see more information before I accept they actually livedamong the people, I have no problem in accepting that the culturewas seriously influenced, either by legends and myths originatingfrom ET activity, or by the direct appearance ofspacecraft and theiroccupants. If you look at many of the statues, artwork, and facemake-up from early Egypt and Mesopotamia, they often emphasiselarge eyes. There are several civilisations elsewhere in the Universewhich have very large eyes when compared to ours. I am sure thatsome Egyptian ‘gods’ were extraterrestrial in origin and theEgyptians said that these ‘gods’ went into the sky in their flyingboats.There is a view among some researchers which says that ETs, somewith a human-like form, came regularly to the Earth in these ancienttimes and began the tradition of God-kings in many civilisationswhich, in Egypt, manifested as the Pharaohs. It is said that thesekings were the human extension of negative extra-terrestrial controland that the whole idea of a monarchy came from their wish tomanipulate humanity.

The monarchs, too, were conned and indoctrinated, it issaid. I don’t know and have no way of knowing if there is any truth inthis, but I offer it to you as information only and make of it what youwill. I’ve put it all on the back burner for now with a great deal else.One highly significant Pharaoh was Amenophis IV. About fiveyears into his reign he adopted the name Khu-n-aten and is nowknows as Akhenaten. He abolished idols and the traditional multi-godreligion and moved the capital from Thebes to a new city in MiddleEgypt called El-Amarna. A Brotherhood temple was built there in theshape of a cross and he established the simple worship of the SunGod, Aten. Perhaps he realised the true significance of the Sun as asource of knowledge and guidance, or possibly he was used by theBrotherhood to create a new one-god religion. Some researchers seehim as a tool of the Brotherhood infiltrators who misled his people.Maybe he was. I don’t know the truth about him. Anyone can bemanipulated; that is particularly true when you have left this physicallevel and can no longer challenge what is said and done in yourname. Look at the man we call Jesus! And as I keep stressing, secretsocieties can be used for good or ill - it depends on who is in controland what the society is they are operating in. The French Resistancein the Second World War was a secret society in a sense. You can’t beblack and white on this as some researchers are. For instance, Ibelieve that Akhenaten was right, there is only one God, one overallconsciousness, but that doesn’t mean that I agree with everything elsehe believed. We have to be selective and free ourselves from rigiddogma.What I do feel is that at least after the time of Akenaton theinfiltration of the Brotherhood and it’s expansion did gather pace.When Akhenaton died in about 1362Bc his successors moved thecourt back to Thebes and reinstated the multi-god religions. Onesuccessor had a preference for the cult of the god Amen or Amun andhe changed his name from Tutankhaten to Tutankhamun. He was tobecome world-famous thousands of years later when his tomb wasuncovered in the Valley of the Kings at Luxor. Akhenaton was to bebranded a heretic. While the court was moved back to Thebes, theBrotherhood and its Mystery School of secret initiations stayed put.It used the temple built by Akhenaton as its headquarters and, indoing so, broke away from the state hierarchy. From El-Amarna,agents of the Brotherhood were sent out to set up other branches far"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"37and wide. I believe that from this point, the Egyptian Brotherhoodwas probably working with less than positive intent and theexpansion of the inflitrated, Luciferic version would now begin tospread its influence and manipulation. Each of the Brotherhoodpriests at El-Amarna had a bald spot and wore a cord around his robe,tied at the loins. This mode of appearance was later to be adopted bymany other orders such as the Franciscan monks in Christian times.The Mystery Schools were a vehicle to pass on the secret knowledgeand for the use of hallucinogenic drugs, sexual orgies or rites, andhuman sacrifice was not unknown either, depending on whocontrolled them. Mind control techniques were well understood.Offshoots of the Brotherhood began to emerge, particularly fromthese Egyptian and Babylonian times. Each had the same secretcodes, symbols and initiations. No one in these secret societies isallowed to know what is going on at the level above them and this isan extremely effective means of manipulation which has been usedthrough the ages. Such organisations continue to this day with nameslike the Freemasons, Knights Templar, the Order of the Knights of StJohn, the Order of the Quest, the Knights of Malta, the Jesuits. TheBrotherhood is now almost completely under the control of thenegative consciousness, the Round Table and countless others. Thenames may have changed and the number increased enormouslysince ancient times, but the agenda remains the same. I am not sayingthat every member of these societies is knowingly working againstthe good of humanity. Certainly not. Most of them will not have aclue of how their society is being used. What I am saying is thatthose groups and others are being controlled by people who areseeking to continue and complete the ‘Great Work of Ages’ - thetakeover of the planet and the human mind. How they propose tocomplete that task we will see later.One of the most active Brotherhood organisations today are theFreemasons and they would seem to have their origins in Sumer andEgypt in the guilds of the stonemasons and craftsmen. These guildscopied many of the Brotherhood and mystery school traditions andinitiations. The title Grand Master, which is common to most secretBrotherhood branches, was already being used at this time. Later,these guilds would evolve into freemasonry which is open to anyoneconsidered acceptable (not just masons) and has been a front forsome outrageous behaviour and manipulation.

Freemasonry is, today, the major arm of the Brotherhood.Five thousand years after ancient Egypt, Albert Pike, the GrandCommander of the Supreme Council of Freemasonry in America,would describe this secret society as:“The Custodian and depository of the great philosophical andreligious truths unknown to the world at large, and handed down fromage to age by an unbroken current of tradition, embodied in symbols,emblems, and allegories.”It is often asked who are the ‘they’, the elite that researchers speakof in relation to the conspiracy to control the human race. How cansuch an ambition possibly have spanned thousands of years? As Pikesaid, the knowledge and the agenda is handed down through thegenerations. ‘They’ are people who have been accepted into thehighest levels of initiation by the infiltrated Brotherhood societies. Atany point in history over the last 5,000 years those accepted into thehighest degrees have continued the Great Work, while looking forthose with the potential to take over from them. So while thepersonnel change, the agenda and methods have remained very muchthe same. Only those considered certain to continue the work andkeep it secret are accepted in the elite levels. One way potential“adepts” have been tested is by telling them to spit on the cross.Those who refuse are congratulated for their commitment to serveGod and reject such heresy. But they are never subsequentlyconsidered for promotion, because they cannot be trusted with theknowledge of the real agenda. Those who do spit on the cross are theones who go on up the ladder because, among other things, they doas they are told.It is part of the Freemasons’ mythology that human civilisationswere begun by visitors from the star Sirius which they connect withthe Egyptian goddess, Isis. Sumerian stories record that these ETswere fish-like in their appearance - the ‘Oannes’ I mentioned before -and that they passed on information about building, spiritualsymbolism, science and arts. The Egyptians certainly acknowledgedthe importance of Sirius to them. The Freemasonic and Brotherhoodsymbol of the pyramid with the capstone depicted as the all-seeingeye goes back to these ancient times, this is said to represent the eyeof Sirius - although I see it as Lucifer. The Dogon people in Mali, insub-Saharan Africa, have had a legend, probably originating in"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"39Egypt, which has been passed on over five thousand years. It tells ofa star that they claimed orbited Sirius. They knew it as the smallestand heaviest of stars containing the germs of all things and theDogons said that it weighed so much that ‘all the Earthly beingscombined cannot lift it’. The legend further claims that it took fiftyyears for the star to orbit Sirius.All this is remarkable when you think that the star they have knownabout for thousands of years was not officially discovered until thelast century and was photographed for the first time in 1970. It hasbeen named Sirius B, and the Dogons have been proved correct intheir claims. For it does take around fifty years to complete an orbitand scientists have suggested that one cubic foot of Sirius B matterwould weigh 2,000 tons. Obviously, Sirius is of considerablerelevance to what has been happening on this planet. How couldEarth people know such details unless they were told by those whoknew? Extra-terrestrials or highly accurate channelling?Freemasonry, like most secret societies of the infiltratedBrotherhood, bases its beliefs and aims on the worship of the Sun Godand Mother Goddess mythology which it is believed was common toancient civilisations. This Father/Mother belief was reflected in theEgyptian trinity of gods - Osiris, the father, Isis, the mother, andHorus, the son. Another name often used for the Brotherhood is itsLatin name, the Illuminati, or ‘illuminated ones’. It may soundfantastic at this stage in our story, but the world is controlled today bya Brotherhood of secret societies which go back to this period. Theswastika, the lamb, the obelisk, the apron, which some Egyptian godsare depicted as wearing, and of course the pyramid and eye are still thesymbols of the Brotherhood societies. Thousands of years after ancientEgypt you can find the pyramid and eye symbol very easily inAmerica. It forms the reverse of the Great Seal of the United Statesand appears on every dollar bill. The truths pedalled by the negativesecret societies have been twisted enough to mislead their members. Ifeel the Egyptian beliefs have been misrespresented to an extent, but,as one researcher said so correctly, it doesn’t matter if what theybelieve is true or even if you believe it. As long as they believe it, weare all affected by the way their thinking influences their actions.Channelling was at the centre of the Egyptian culture and could beused to control or, as it was in many cases, to gather knowledge thatwas not being made available from elsewhere. Just as the Lucifericconsciousness wishes to control people, so the consciousness of ‘The"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"40Light’ wishes to set them free by allowing them access to the spiritualtruths that are being denied them. Channelling is an important way ofdoing this. This is one reason why, despite the efforts of themanipulators, many people in Babylon and Egypt had more spiritualknowledge than either the ETs or the elite wanted them to know.Channellers were widely consulted as a source of divine inspirationand there were rooms called the holy of holies or sanctuaries whereinter-frequency communications took place. These were built onenergy points where a ‘god’ (a discarnate consciousness in this case)could communicate most effectively. This is how the prophets in theBible got their information. Those in the Christian Church whoequate channelling with devil worship should know that the termprophet comes from the Greek word which means medium!In the early Egyptian period, some worshipped the Sun god Ra, andothers followed the god Amun or Amen. These two later becamefused into one, Amun or Amen Ra. After their prayers and religiousteachings they would say the name of their god. This was passed onthrough Judaism into Christianity and, in churches all over the worldtoday, Christians still end their prayers and readings with the word‘Amen’. How many know that, in doing so, they are saying the nameof a Pagan god of channelled or extraterrestrial origin, just as theEgyptians did? Amen also represents a sound, by the way, thatresonates a certain frequency known to the ancients. Egyptianmythology had a trinity of gods in Osiris, the father, Isis, the mother,and Horus, the son. The Egyptians believed that Osiris came to sufferso that those who believed in him would live. He was known as Lordof Eternity, the Judge and Saviour of the human race, theResurrection and the Life, the Bread of Life, the Redeemer andMediator who would decide the eternal fate of heaven or hell for thedead. Horus was portrayed sitting on his mother’s knee and, fromthis, the idea of the Madonna and child was to emerge in Christianity.The Egyptian figure of evil, Set, became the Christian version, Satan.The cross was an Egyptian symbol for thousands of years before itwas adopted by Christianity and the Egyptians celebrated the festivalof Easter, the day that Horus, the son, was said to have died and risenagain to become one with his father. All this would have beeninfluenced by the Babylonian belief in Bel and both would havebegun with the same channelled communications or extraterrestrialinfluence. In fact, I think that most of this symbolism relates back toextra-terrestrial activities and the star systems they came from, and"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"41from the knowledge that the day was approaching when the forces ofdisharmony (Set, Satan, Lucifer etc) would be overcome by harmony.That time is now.The idea of a trinity of gods, or three gods in one, is a theme thatruns through countless pre-Christian religions. The Christians merelycopied it as they copied everything else. Some of the symbolism ofthe trinity is linked to energy balancing. The three points of thetriangle stand for positive/negative/balance, and male/female/balance. The triangle is a well-known esoteric symbol as is thedouble interconnecting triangle known as the Star of David. Thisrepresents the balance of the spiritual with the balance of thephysical.Thousands of years before Christianity, dogmatic religious belief,based on the misunderstandings and twisted truths I havehighlighted, was already being used by the Luciferic consciousnessin its many guises to close down the potential of the human mind andto fill it with myths and the literal interpretation of symbolic stories.The fear of the gods and the horrors that would be visited upon thosewho did not do as they were told was a very effective way of keepingthe masses from the knowledge of their true selves. The god kings ofthe various cultures and the gathering power of the priests asinterpreters of the gods’ desires added to the expansion of thereligious dogma and control.The Egyptian elite were an advanced people for their time in manyways, although they kept most of the population in physical andspiritual slavery. They performed operations - mummies have beenfound with well-set fractures and false teeth. It was to be manythousands of years before anything like this appeared in Europe.Educated Egyptians understood the principles of astronomy andastrology, as did the Babylonians. Astronomy and astrology wereseen as indivisible sciences. The richer Egyptians lived in beautifulhomes with elegant furniture and artwork. In England, three thousandyears later, some Christian clergy were still condemning the use ofknives and forks as the work of the devil.The culture and belief systems developed in Mesopotamia andEgypt possibly under the influence of extra-terrestrials andchannelled sources were to have a fundamental impact on all thatfollowed. India was also developing a distinct culture in thepreChristian world but, again, the basis of the Hindu religion wasinherited from the West when Aryan peoples invaded around 1500BC"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"42and turned the Indians into their servants. The gods of India,therefore, have a somewhat familiar ring. The father god of theHindus is Brahma and he is part of a trinity of gods which includesKrishna, their version of the Jesus-type figure. Krishna is the Hindusaviour (see Bel, Osiris, etc). He is said to have lived around1,000BC and is still revered today in much the same way as Jesus.The texts from which Hinduism was created are called the Vedas andin them you can find references which appear to record extra-terrestrial activities. Hinduism was a religion introduced by theinvaders to create a strict system of hierarchy known as castes. It wasa means to divide and rule. The religious apartheid which Hinduismpromotes with its castes, taboos and impositions is a continuingconfirmation, as with most religion, that large areas of incarnatehumanity are yet to evolve from spiritual childhood. But, if you wanta system of control, it’s wonderful and it is being used in that waytoday just as it was by the Aryans. Missionaries from the EgyptianBrotherhood also arrived in India during and after the invasion and,as a consequence, its power began to expand rapidly. India is, today,a major centre of Brotherhood activity.Five hundred years after the physical life claimed for Krishna cameGautama Buddha which translates as Guatama the Enlightened.Today he is known simply as Buddha and, in his name the, religion ofBuddhism has flourished. Buddha was born in India into a royalfamily. He was a prince, but he gave up this privilege and wealth tospread his philosophy which incorporated reincarnation and anethical way of life based on peace and love. I don’t agree with all thathe believed in but there is much that I can easily support. He spokeout against the priests of the day and encouraged the pursuit of truth,wisdom and knowledge. He talked of a universal brotherhood (thepositive variety!) and equal rights for men and women. Buddhaspoke simple truths. He had no desire to be turned into some saviour-god or to be worshipped by followers who complicated his simplephilosophy with additions, ceremonies and hierarchies. All he stoodfor - and all we ever reall; need - are spiritual truths, not endless‘isms’ to complicate them.After Buddha’s physical release, his beliefs became the dominantreligion in India. In the third century, King Asoka would adoptBuddhism and send his representatives across the known world topromote its philosophy. They travelled as far as Alexandria in Egyptwhere it became diluted somewhat by the Egyptian idea of Osiris,"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"43Isis and Horus. The depiction of Horus in the arms of his mother, Isis,became Buddha in the arms of the goddess, Hatari. Buddhism wasreplaced by Brahmanism as the major religion in India, but it wasaccepted by other Eastern countries and has made significant inroadsinto other parts of the world. Buddha’s contribution to the raising ofplanetary consciousness was very successful. He is a wonderfulexample of how the volunteer consciousness seeks to work, withsimple truths and no imposition. Hinduism was to become the statereligion in India as the centuries passed and it was to do for Indianevolution what Christianity did in the West. It held back their mentaland spiritual development for thousands of years.Confucius was another volunteer incarnation. He was born inabout 551Bc in China. His real name was K’ung Fu-tze whichmeant Master K’ung but this became Latinised into Confucius. Heworked as a schoolmaster and stressed ethical conduct and theimportance of setting an example through one’s own behaviour. Hewas later a brilliant magistrate and Minister of Crime who arguedvigorously for social reform. But, like many of his kind, hiswisdom was acknowledged less in his lifetime than after hisphysical death. He died a disappointed man, believing he hadfailed to bring about the change of attitude he had hoped for.However, with his going he became a national hero and his wordshave been constantly quoted ever since. Sometimes, when we leavethis level we can release an energy which can affect people longafterwards and those who tune to this energy field will begin tofocus on what that person has done and said. One Confucian sayingwas, “what you do not like when done to yourself do not do toothers”. This theme of ‘do to others what you would have them doto you’ is common to many religions and philosophies. Many claimit for themselves when it is really an eternal truth. If we allobserved it in our everyday lives, what a different world it wouldbe. In China, during the life of Confucius, there was another beingof great evolution called Lao-tsze, from whom we get Taoism. Hisviews were similar to those of Buddha but they, too, werecomplicated and devalued in the usual way by those who followedthe ‘ism’ created in his name. The Chinese led the world in theirgreatest periods with their knowledge and creativity. Theyidentified the energy grid of the Earth which they called DragonLines and they introduced a form of healing called acupuncturewhich balanced the flows in the energy grid of the human body."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"44They also discovered the opposing forces which need to be kept inbalance and called them the yin and the yang.Buddha, Confucius, Lao-tsze, Jesus: the list goes on. All these, andothers like them, are aspects of consciousness who came intoincarnation to bring to this frequency simple messages from higherfrequencies in order to raise and awaken human consciousness fromthe bondage of religion, myth and ignorance. As superb psychicchannellers who could access information and understanding fromvery high sources, they also channelled energies to the planet ofimmense power. In most cases, their later followers have turned theminto saviour figures or people to be worshipped as mystical heroes.This has often polluted their philosophy on life into dogmas andcreeds. They have also attributed to them sayings and experiencesthat either never happened or derived from myths, events and peopleof an earlier time or different location. It is the last thing they wantedor believed in when they walked this Earth, I feel.Before we leave the pre-Christian story in Europe and the East,we need to look at two other civilisations which have had aprofound impact on human evolution, the Greeks and the Romans.Around the Aegean Sea, thousands of years before Christianity,there were incarnations of the volunteer consciousness. Someinfluenced people in the area where Athens was later built andhelped to start the Mycenaean civilisation. Others incarnated on theisland of Crete and became known as the Minoans. At Knossos onCrete you can still see the ruins of a magnificent palace called theLabyrinth. Without knowing its historical background, I went toCrete on holiday. When we visited Knossos I was guided by myintuition to bury in the ruins of the palace a large crystal I had beengiven in Glastonbury. The palace was clearly built on a strong earthenergy point, as were most ancient palaces and temples. Theancients had a greater understanding of the nature of earth energiesthan those who came after them in the Christian era. Again, when Italk of volunteer incarnations, I don’t mean that they were the wholecivilisation, only certain members of it. Sometimes they werelistened to, sometimes ignored or even killed. The Mycenaeansworshipped a trinity of gods and their religious symbol was thecross. They were conquered by tribes of Aryan peoples who tookcontrol of the land we call Greece. They worshipped a god calledZeus. The Ancient Greeks (also known as the Hellenes) were not anation as such in these early days. They were a series of independent"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"45tribes and were only formed together into a nation when Philip ofMacedonia took control in the 4th century BC. By then they hadfounded the original Olympics.The Greeks at this time did not have a state religion. People wereallowed to worship whichever gods they felt right were right for themand they would consult the hundreds of ‘Oracles’ (channellers) whowere available in the temples and shrines for guidance. Again, we seethis misunderstanding between discarnate communicators and ‘gods’which has caused so much confusion. The word ‘angel’ comes fromthe Greek angelos, meaning messenger. Angels were believed to bedivine messengers. This pagan belief was encompassed into Christiandoctrine. The Greeks produced some outstanding examples of thevolunteer consciousness. In the 6th century BC, Xenophanes wassuggesting that God was not a man but a mind which orders theUniverse and is beyond human understanding. He said there was aunity of all things and ‘the all is one and the one is God’.Xenophanes challenged the belief that a god came to Earth andsuffered so that our sins could be forgiven. As we have seen, thiscame from Bel, perhaps even earlier, and the sacrifice of the lamb.But, later, along would come Christianity to carry on that myth foranother 2,000 years. The great Greek thinkers, who wereunfortunately only in the minority, realised that the Universe isgoverned by mathematical law and consciousness of high evolution,and not by mythical gods.The period 600 to 300BC saw Greece at the height of itsintellectual powers. Pythagoras and Thales travelled to Egypt toabsorb its knowledge which they would use together with their owninspiration and research to become the first Greek scientists. Sciencecomes from a Latin word meaning knowledge. Thales was thefounder of Greek geometry, astronomy and philosophy whilePythagoras was a superb mathematician who said, as did Philolaus,that the earth revolved around the Sun. This was two thousand yearsbefore it became accepted wisdom. Pythagoras was a social andreligious reformer who stood for truth and ethics in all things. He wasa vegetarian by ethical choice. Healing was another aspect of Greeklife which evolved rapidly in this period and Hippocrates becameknown as the Father of Medicine. Doctors still take the Hippocraticoath. He refused to accept the idea, prevalent until then, that illnesswas caused by sin or devils. Surgery developed, too, in Greece butChristianity would put an end to all that for around 1700 years"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"46because they believed in the resurrection of the physical body. Theydid not want mutilated bodies being resurrected and, as Christianpower grew, Greek and Roman hospitals and healing centres wouldbe destroyed and their doctors killed or banished. The Greeks werethe first people since Atlantis to make geography a science. Theyproduced the first historians, they investigated the laws of physicsand discovered the law of cause and effect. Democritus suggestedthat matter was made up of atoms two thousand four hundred yearsbefore modern science. Greece produced outstanding playwrights,artists and orators and created laws and forms of democraticgovernment which have been the foundations of what we see today.The word democracy comes from Greece.The three greatest philosophers of this time were Socrates, Plato,and Aristotle. They did not know everything or get their knowledgeright, and they were influenced to an extent by the culture aroundthem. But here were three aspects of the volunteer consciousnesswho were, in so much of their understanding, thousands of years inadvance of their time. Socrates was a medium who communicatedwith other levels and pursued truth, knowledge and understandingwith unwavering determination. He talked in the market places andon street corners, propounding his views and questioning people inorder to gain more knowledge. He said that a revolution of thoughtwas the only way to a revolution of behaviour. Socrates was the firstsince Atlantis to explain scientifically the mystery of life. He taughtthat around the Earth were many mansions for the soul’. How closethis is to the many mansions in my Father’s house’ in the Bible. Healso said that those we contacted in these ‘many mansions were notsupernatural gods but discarnate beings like us. Socrates was notpopular with the priests who still had power despite the underminingof their credibility by these outstanding men. While they were tuningto extremely high levels of consciousness, the mass of the peoplewere still influenced by ignorant priests. Socrates was accused ofcorrupting the young by propounding heretical ideas and wassentenced to death by drinking hemlock. This he did with greatcalmness and confidence, because he knew where he was going andhe knew it was better than where he was. When asked by his friend,Crito, how he wished to be buried, Socrates replied, “Wherever youwill, if only you can catch me. Is it not strange that, after all I havesaid to convince you that I am going to the society of the happy, youstill think this body to be Socrates? To die and be released is better"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"47for me.The execution of Socrates for speaking his mind was a rarehappening in Athens, and it came during a period when the ideals offreedom of speech were temporarily forgotten. Normally, Greece,with its liberal attitude, provided a great contrast to other areas of theworld where one could be murdered for the mildest questioning ofthose in power. Socrates had been allowed to speak freely until then.Indeed, freedom of speech, religion and politics were generally anaccepted part of life except for the odd period when those idealslapsed. Socrates must have said the wrong thing at the wrong timefrom the point of view of the authorities because his pupil, Plato, waslater allowed to continue to speak in the same vein without losing hislife. Plato was devastated by his friend’s death and left Greece tovisit Egypt, Palestine, Italy and Sicily. He learned from the peopleand cultures he encountered while outlining his beliefs in virtue andjustice wherever he went. Plato was a man of courage and spoke outagainst tyranny. He saw it as cowardice which, of course, it is. TheKing of Sicily was so outraged by this that he had Plato arrested andsold into slavery. Fortunately, he was bought by a supporter whogave him back his freedom. When you are here for the good of theplanet and humanity, the other levels are always trying to protect youin times of danger. They work through others who are in closeenough contact with their higher selves to be used as a means ofcommunicating through their thoughts. In this case, Plato was boughtby a supporter and not by someone who might have prevented all thewonderful work he had yet to do.Plato returned to Athens and founded a school of philosophy whichwas called the Academy. It was named after the garden in which itwas built and, today, we still use the word academy for aneducational institution. Those with open minds flocked to hear thePlato wisdom. Pupils were encouraged to think, question and look ateverything with open, inquiring minds. Every opinion waswelcomed. He said that things were not always what they appeared atfirst to be. Two thousand three hundred years ago he said the mindwas the eternal part of us which could exist outside the physicalbody. Even today, our so called state-of-the-art science still hasn’trealised that the eternal mind and the brain are not the same and thatconsciousness can exist outside the body. Indeed, that is its usualstate. Plato, incidentally, was apparently involved in the Greekmystery school of the time, which shows that not all of these"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"48Brotherhood secret societies were negative. He passed on muchinformation he gathered there.Just as Socrates taught Plato, so Plato taught Aristotle. I think thatAristotle was a reincarnation of the Socrates consciousness. Socrateshelped Plato to awaken to his true self and, through reincarnation,Plato did the same for him later when he became the personalitycalled Aristotle. You can see how reincarnation can allow a relativelyfew aspects of consciousness to have an ongoing affect on humanthinking. When one of their physical lives ends, another begins, andthe work continues in another body. I think the Lucifericconsciousness works in exactly the same way. Aristotle was a geniusof his time. He was well versed in chemistry, physics, biology,mathematics, astronomy, botany, anatomy and psychology and wasalways searching for further understanding in all these subjects andmore. Like Plato, he started a school. It was known as the Lyceum.He also inspired the foundation of the famous university atAlexandria where people could research and lecture without thediversions of the mythical gods promoted by the religions.The intellectual greatness of Athens withered during thePeloponnesian War when the Spartans and Corinthians combinedwith others to defeat the Athenians. The war lasted twenty-sevenyears and the pre-eminence of Athens was over. Within a fewcenturies of it being Christianised, the Church would burn all thewritings of Plato, Aristotle and other Greek knowledge that came tolight. They saw this human enlightenment as heresy against theBible. But some of their work survived and would rise again topublic attention after the Renaissance in Europe.The incarnations of the volunteer consciousness that propelledAthens into the centre of intellectual thought was extremelysuccessful in raising understanding and would continue to affect thethinking of millions over the centuries. But the power of theLuciferic consciousness to control the minds of so many should notbe underestimated. Its most important weapons are conflict,imposition and ignorance, and it would have been very determined toput an end to what was happening in Athens. The Lucifer-controlledhuman beings in the negative secret societies and elsewhere, alwaysseek to stimulate conflict. The cause doesn’t matter as long as ithappens. The wars that destroyed intellectual Athens and the pursuitof further knowledge would be repeated across the globe and overthe generations, as the struggle between harmony and disharmony"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"49increased in its intensity.Greek philosophy would influence the Romans. Around 1OOOBCsome nomadic tribes settled alongside the River Tiber in what is nowItaly. They called their settlement Latium, hence Latin. This languagewas the fusion of the Aryan tongue and the Celtic. It evolved throughthe interaction and inter-marriage of the Aryan speakers and thedarker-skinned Iberia Celts. By 753Bc, a trading centre had beenestablished near to seven hills and was named Roma. From thisbeginning was to come a vast empire which, at its peak, wouldencompass Spain, France (Gaul), Italy, Dalmatia, Macedonia,Greece, Asia Minor, Syria, Palestine, Libya, Numidia, Corsica,Sardinia, Sicily, Crete, Cyprus, Egypt and most of Britain andMesopotamia. This was achieved largely through violence andslaughter.The early Romans were governed by kings. They had a flirtationwith a republic, though it could hardly be described as a democracy.The priests with their mumbo jumbo still held sway. There was apeople’s forum, a sort of popular assembly called the Comita Tributabut, any time the priests said the gods did not wish it to take place, ithad to be cancelled. The priests determined the wishes of the gods byexamining the hearts and livers of sacrificed animals. They believedthat the heart and liver were the seat of the mind and that, throughthem, the gods could speak to them. The chaotic republic wasreplaced by a series of Emperors. This began after the emergence ofthe most famous Roman of them all, Julius Caesar, who was born in1OOBC. He was a military leader who fought, conquered, andterrorised most of Europe. For, despite all his gifts as an orator andgeneral, he was a tyrant and a butcher. He had many enemies inRome who feared and resented his growing power. Eventually, heinvaded his own country. He crossed a stream called the Rubiconwhich marked the border between his province and the rest of Italy.He took control of Rome and her empire and, in time, gave himselfthe title Pontifex Maximus as head of the state religion. This title ofthe head of what was a pagan religion is now held by the Pope! JuliusCaesar was seen by most of his subjects as a divine being, yet anothergod king. Caesar travelled to Egypt where he fell for the charms ofCleopatra whom he would later take to Rome. But, in 44Bc, he wasmurdered on the Ides (15th) of March by those who hated him for thepower he had over them and the Empire.There followed a long series of emperors, most of them less than"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"50wise and compassionate, but there were many good things about theRoman civilisation, too. Nothing is all good or all bad. Under the ruleof Vespasian in the nine years from 7OAD a system of education wasintroduced which was influenced by the ideas and beliefs of Platoand Aristotle. He made his minister of education a Spaniard turnedRoman citizen called Quintilian who much admired the Greekphilosophers. He organised an elaborate system of schools in theRoman Empire which taught the virtues of liberty, justice and truth,while abhorring cruelty and oppression. If only they and their like inGreece had been allowed to flourish and grow, what a different worldwe would live in today. Instead, Christianity was to cast its darknessacross the Roman Empire and beyond. The schools were closed andtheir teachers scattered or killed because the pursuit of knowledgeoutside the pages of the Bible was seen as heresy. The great library atAlexandria was turned into a theological college and darkness anddelusion descended on the collective mind of the human race.So, in our story, we have been through two distinct phases ofhuman history. There were the times when extra-terrestrialspopulated the planet. Then, after the end of Atlantis, fewer of themcame here but they still landed, and were seen by the people as gods.Channelling and psychic communications became the means throughwhich the ‘gods’ most influenced us. ETs working for the Light - thegreat majority - and the Light Consciousness, have, in general, beenworking through the volunteers and any humans who wish to heartheir message of love and spiritual freedom. But the Light will notinterfere in human free will while the Luciferic stream has no suchethics. It has used whatever means necessary to create conflict,confusion and ignorance.All three of which bring to mind what has been one of Lucifer’smost effective vehicle for suppressing knowledge, understanding andmental liberation. It was his invention and it has served his cause sowonderfully well. Only today, nearly two thousand years later, are webeginning to cast off the yoke it has imposed on human evolution. Itis the tragedy we call Christianity."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"514Bible StoriesThe story of the Jews is woven through the early Middle Easterncultures.About eighteen centuries before Christianity some event caused theEuphrates to change its course and bypass the Sumer city of Ur. Nomore could the land around the city be irrigated by an extensivesystem of ditches, nor could their ships reach the sea to trade. Theinhabitants moved inland to settle alongside the river at Babylon.Abraham of the Old Testament left the city of Ur with his family andslaves. Among them was his nephew, Lot. According to Hebrewscriptures they settled in Syria (an abbreviation of Assyria) whichthey called Canaan. This name was later given to the whole area westof the Jordan, including what became Palestine. They led a nomadiclife with their animals and at one time they travelled to Egypt insearch of food during a famine. Abraham was much impressed bywhat he saw in Egypt and he took this knowledge of their beliefs andcustoms back to Canaan. He became a wealthy and influential manand used his hundreds of armed slaves to support various factions inthe wars between Canaanite communities.Abraham fathered two children late in his life by two women,Hagar and Sarai, and they were named Ishmael and Isaac. It is quitepossible, given his advanced age, that they were fathered by ayounger man or men. It was now that Abraham introducedcircumcision which he had seen used in Egypt. Abraham’s idea wasto create a distinction between the followers of his God and the otherpeoples of Canaan. They worshipped the Sumerian god, Enlil, whichbecame known as Allah or El. It was originally a Sun god, thoughalmost certainly with extra-terrestrial origins, and they would havethought they were communicating with this being through theirchannellings. With the death of Abraham, his son Isaac became headof the family and he had twin sons, Esau and Jacob. The family and"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"52its offshoots were still nomads, but rich ones by the standards of thetime. Jacob, the story goes, fathered twelve sons and the one hecalled Joseph was sold by jealous brothers to travelling merchants inthe desert. Joseph was taken by them to Egypt where he was sold intoslavery, but later he would become a favourite of the Pharaoh. Thismay sound far fetched at first, but Egypt was then ruled by Bedouminvaders, the Hyksos or ‘Shepherd Kings’. They were the same raceas Joseph, the Arab nomad, and they had a similar culture. Josephwas made prime minister and put in charge of food production inEgypt. When ten of his brothers were driven to Egypt by famine theywere reunited. Joseph was known as Israel, which means ‘El (God)does battle’ and his family and descendants would be calledIsraelites.The twelve sons ofJacob grew into twelve tribes. The so-calledHouse ofJoseph, the slave-turned prime minister, took a differentcourse to the others. The Israelites settled in an area called Goshen onthe Eastern side of Lower Egypt, and over the next four hundredyears or so they became a nation. All was well for them while theShepherd Kings reigned in Egypt, but when they were removed byrebellion life became tough for the Israelites. They were disarmedand put to work as slaves. The Egyptians decreed that all malechildren of the Israelites should be killed and the intention was thatsoon the Israelite nation would cease to exist.Around the thirteenth century BC the man known as Moses wasborn and, it is said, was brought up by a Pharaoh’s daughter after hewas found floating in a basket in the bulrushes. The story goes thathe killed an Egyptian for badly treating an Israelite and fled into thedesert of Sinai. There he learned more of Allah, the God of Abraham,and he had what appeared to be profound psychic experiences andcommunications. To this had to be God and not just a discarnateentity. Either that or he was contacted by extra-terrestrials orsubjected to some sort of mind-suggestion. Some of the descriptionsin the Bible of this god of Moses could certainly be space craft ofsome kind. It is worth pointing out, too, that ET technology canproject three dimensional images we call holograms which appear tobe visions. The craft need not be seen when this is happening and‘miracles’ like a burning bush would be easy for ETs to manifest.Anyway, whatever it was that happened to Moses, his experiences ledhim to reject the Egyptian trinity of gods, Osiris, Isis, and Horus, andturn to Allah or El, the ‘One God’. Interestingly, Moses would surely"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"53have attended the Brotherhood Mystery School in Egypt given hisroyal connections and they were promoting the idea of one God atleast from the time of Akhenaten. It has been stressed to me inchannelling that we should not underestimate the knowledge ofhypnosis and mind-controlling drugs available in the mystery schoolsat this time.On the death of the Pharaoh, Moses returned to Egypt where hetold the Israelites that Allah had appeared to him in the desert. Thegod had said they were his chosen people. He said further that Allahwished to be known by the Israelites as Yhuh, which was pronounced‘Yarweh’ and later became Jehovah. This means ‘Rain Cloud’. Fromnow on all the Israelite channellers were thought to be vehicles forthe god Jehovah and the promises made to them through thesesources were believed to be the promises of their god.It was the same with other peoples the world over and this is howmany god-myths originated. As Luke’s Gospel says: “He [God]spake from the mouth of his holy prophets (channellers) which havebeen since the world began.” When you look at the communicationsMoses was supposed to have had with Jehovah on Mount Sinai youcan relate it to the communications on Mount Olympus which theGreeks claimed to have had with their god, Zeus. The same themesrun through all of them.Moses told the new Pharaoh of his communications and asked forpermission to lead the Israelites out of Egypt to the land of Abrahamin Canaan, the ‘promised land’ which ‘God’ had told him about. ThePharaoh eventually agreed and the great exodus began. They tookwith them the mummy ofjoseph and walked across the Red Sea by asand bar which Napoleon I was also later to use. On the journey, it issaid, Moses was given by ‘God’ the laws of his tribe which areknown as the Ten Commandments with all those ‘Thou shalt nots’and such like. Perhaps he channelled them or maybe he just thoughthe was channelling them because similar laws could be found inother areas of the Middle East. Maybe he met with the occupants of aspacecraft. As the biblical description says:“On the morning of the third day, there was thunder and lightning,a thick cloud appeared on the mountain, and a very loud trumpet washeard. (Jehovah often arrived with the sound of trumpets.) All thepeople in the camp trembled with fear.“Moses led them out of the camp to meet God and they stood at the"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"54foot of the mountain. The whole of Mount Sinai was covered withsmoke, because the Lord had come down on it in fire. The smoke wentup like the smoke of a furnace, and all the people trembled violently.”Exodus 19: vv 16-18.Imagine what it would be like for that ancient people, or evenpeople today, to see a spacecraft land on a mountain top and you canappreciate what might have been happening on Mount Sinai. Thefierce, harsh, and bloodthirsty God of the Old Testament would fitwith the theme of extremely negative extra-terrestrials who sought tocontrol people on Earth through fear and imposition. Exodus goeson:“When the people heard the thunder and the trumpet blast and sawthe lightening and the smoking mountain, they trembled with fear andstood a long way off. They said to Moses, ‘If you speak to us, we willlisten; but we are afraid that if God speaks to us, we will die’.‘Moses replied, ‘Don’t be afraid; God has come only to test(freighten) you and make you keep on obeying him, so that you willnot sin’. But the people continued to stand a long way off and onlyMoses went near the dark cloud where God was.”Exodus 20: vv 18-20This constant mention of a cloud in relation to Jehovah’sappearances is interesting, given also that his name means raincloud’. Producing clouds is not problem for ET technology andindeed the elite Brotherhood scientists of today have the technologyto manipulate the weather, at least in a small area. I have no doubtthat some event happened on Sinai, but I am not convinced thatMoses was given all the Thou Shalt Nots at that time. It is most likelythat the whole story of the commandments is a myth and the laws ofthe Israelites did not come through Moses on the mountain at all.There are many similar stories shared by different civilisations andeach claims them as their own when all they have done is change thenames involved. The religious dogma and ceremonies of theIsraelites were naturally influenced by the Egyptians as you wouldexpect given that they had all been brought up in that country. Theclothing of their priests was inspired by Egypt. Incidentally, duringthe journey, the Israelites had periods of hunger and thirst, obviously,as they walked through the desert lands. According to the stories they"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"55were helped by manna from Heaven. I have seen this portrayed asbread falling from the sky. In fact, manna is a sticky substanceproduced by a desert shrub.It became obvious when they reached the ‘Promised Land’ ofCanaan that the communications to Moses from whatever source hadleft something to be desired. Either that or his communicator wasgiving him some inaccurate information for some reason. They foundwell armed peoples in walled cities who resisted their advance. Moseshad led them to believe that the promised land was unoccupied andwaiting only for them. He was less than popular and the Israeliteswandered in the desert for another forty years before they becamefierce and barbaric warriors. Moses passed on and Joshua, a man ofwar, took over from him. The opposition in the promised land was stilltoo much for them, but under the leadership ofJoshua they ejected theArab shepherd peoples from a large area. This was to be calledPalestine and here they settled down as an agricultural people witheach tribe ruled by a sheik. They were still very primitive. They hadonly stone implements and they made animal sacrifices to Jehovahwho was still being channelled, followed, and often seen in ways thatcould suggest ET involvement. Jehovah was always demanding animalsacrifices and he, or they, were clearly a deeply unpleasant piece ofwork under the control of the Luciferic Consciousness. To becircumcised by a sharp stone doesn’t bear thinking about, but that’swhat happened. It was barbaric.There were occasions when some Israelites would turn away fromthe instructions ofJehovah and worship Baal - Bel, the Son of God ofMesopotamia. As time passed the attributes given to Jehovah andBaal began to merge. Around 1 150Bc, the prophet (channeller)Samuel came on the scene. The Israelites were now controlled by thePhilistines and Samuel inspired a desire for liberty. Saul becameking, against Samuel’s wishes, and he also took over his post of highpriest. Saul turned his tribe ofJudah into the dominant force of theIsraelites, defeating the Philistines and securing independence. Saulhad a great rival in David and to escape Saul’s wrath David went intothe desert ofJudea and lived the life of a criminal, murderer, andoutlaw. Men, women and children were massacred by David and hisband. Many were dismembered or burnt alive. He always consultedJehovah before setting out to steal and kill and always receivedpermission. You can see how any amount of slaughter can bejustifiedin the name of a god when you are either channelling a low"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"56vibrational entity or deluding yourself with your own thoughts. Suchis the story of religion.David became king when he and his bandits joined forces with thePhilistines and conquered Judea. He then turned on, and defeated, thePhilistines, taking Jerusalem in the process. It is from the wordPhilistine that Palestine came after this victory. David’s armies weremerciless, often burning and dismembering their victims. Hisaggression and lust for power fuelled the expansion of his empireinto Canaan, the rest of Syria, and Northern Arabia. He and theIsraelites now controlled a region from the Euphrates to the Red Sea.So the Israelite Empire was born under the control of the House ofJudah. We are now in the period up to 1015Bc. As Arthur Findlaypoints out in his outstanding work, The Curse of Ignorance, peoplewere still being fined and jailed in Britain up to the last century fordaring to criticise David and other Old Testament heroes who werebelieved to be vehicles for the righteousness of God.After David came his son Solomon, the man of ‘wisdom’according to legend. In fact, he had no more respect for human lifethan had David. He killed his brother, the rightful heir under theirlaws, to become king in the first place. Solomon became animportant member of the Brotherhood after he became an advisor tothe Pharaoh, Shishak I, and married his daughter. While in Egypt hewas initiated into the Brotherhood at El Amarna and when hereturned to Jerusalem he built the famous temple to Jehovah whichhas been fought over ever since. It was a Brotherhood temple andSolomon invited the Brotherhood craft guilds of Egypt, theforerunners of the freemasons, to help with its construction. Manyfreemasons are led to believe that their organisation began with thebuilding of Solomon’s temple and this has added to the myth thatfreemasonry is connected with the Bible, the Holy Land, and is inservice to the ‘Great Architect of the Universe’ - God. In fact it goesback well beyond the time of Solomon and, in the case of its elite, itanswers to a very different master. As Albert Pike, the GrandCommander of the Supreme Council of Freemasons in Americawould say in the 1870s:“The Masonic Religion should be by all of us initiates in the HighDegrees maintained in the purity ofthe Luciferic doctrine.”They don’t tell the lower initiates that, however, until they have"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"57agreed to submit themselves with a binding oath to the authority oftheir worshipful master who, according to the MackeyEncyclopedia of Freemasonry, must be obeyed as a first duty ofevery freemason.The secret brotherhood of Babylonia and Egypt was expandingrapidly as was its negative infiltration. It had already spread acrossother parts of the Middle East and one of its best known promoterswas the Canaanite God-King, Melchizedek. His priesthood wore thefamous brotherhood symbol of the apron, and combined it withanother brotherhood symbol, the lamb, by making their aprons out oflamb skin. The freemasons still do this. The Brotherhood is alsoextremely strong and active in Israel and the Jewish culture ingeneral today with its mystical expression, the kabbalah, alsoreflecting the classic practices of Brotherhood societies. The Orderof Melchizadek is kabbalistic and promotes the philosophy of aworld government which is the aim of the negative Brotherhoodmovement.Solomon’s temple was nothing more than a slaughterhouse with astream of animals being sacrificed daily to gratify the perceiveddesires of Jehovah. A high priest and an army of 30,000 ‘lesser’priests were supported by the contributions of the people to carry outthis butchery. Their job had nothing to do with spirituality. They werenothing more than slaughterhouse workers. The priests, who werenow taking over in their religion from the mediums and channellersas the accepted source of Jehovah’s will, announced that their godpreferred the sacrifice of animals rather than crops and vegetation.The crops, you see, had to be burned as part of the sacrifice, but theanimals only had to be killed and the priests then had the right to eator sell the carcass. This same mentality was still alive in the 17thcentury when the first lighthouse was planned. Trinity House hadbeen set up by Henry VIII for the Trinity Brethren, and their duty wasto pray for the souls of people lost at sea. In return they were giventhe rights to everything salvaged from the ships wrecked on theEnglish coast. When the Eddystone Lighthouse was proposed TrinityHouse opposed it because they could see that fewer wrecks meantless salvage for them.Under Solomon, Egyptian and Phoenician beliefs became absorbedinto the Israelite worship ofjehovah and truths, half truths, myths,and lies were becoming merged as the centuries passed. When hedied the Judean empire collapsed and the other tribes of Israel"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"58revolted. Two distinct groups emerged, the Israelites in the northincluding Samaria and Galilee and those in Southern Judea who werecalled the Jews. The worship of Baal re-emerged to challenge that ofJehovah, but the prophets Elijah and more successfully, Elisha, madesure the worship of Baal was destroyed and Jehovah ruled supreme.Women were treated appallingly. They were bought and sold andwhen their husbands died they became part of his estate just like hiscattle and land. Incest was common and children were sold, illtreated, and sacrificed; slavery abounded.The people of Israel believed they were God’s chosen people whowould inherit the Earth, but a shepherd called Amos announced thathe had communicated with Jehovah (the Lord) and he said theirkingdom was to be taken from them. Even worse, Jehovah wouldlead the aggressors because the ‘chosen people’ had defied hisinstructions. Amos was right in that civil war broke out in 745Bc andthe Assyrians took advantage to conquer the lands of Israel. The tennorthern tribes began to disintegrate, a process the Babylonians,Persians, Greeks and Romans would complete. Amos, Hosea andother prophets steered the people away from the belief in anationalistic god and weakened the power of the priests. Theypreferred to promote a gentler God of mercy andjustice who spokefor all people and not only the Israelites.The Assyrians invaded Samaria and later Judea which was by thenbeing guided by the prophet, Isaiah. He proved to be a man of somewisdom and foresight and was obviously channelling a higher levelof consciousness than some of the others. But on his death the oldview ofJehovah returned with the human and animal sacrifices andthe power of the priests. Other prophets like Jeremiah warned of theconsequences. He predicted the destruction of Jerusalem and theTemple (slaughterhouse) built by Solomon. Jeremiah’s predictionswere vindicated when the Chaldeans under Nebuchadnezzar,attacked and defeated the people of Judea, the Jews. By 586BcJudah was no more and Jerusalem was in ruins. The Jews weredispersed across Chaldea as had already happened to the Israelites.They absorbed the customs and beliefs of the Mesopotamianpeoples and many moved their devotion from Jehovah to Bel. Theexiles inherited the Chaldean idea of rest on the seventh day, theSabatu, and on their return the tradition would begin of attendingchurches or Synagogues to hear the writings of the prophets. Whenthey were freed by the Persians, as noted earlier, they took the"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"59Mesopotamian customs and beliefs back to Samaria and Judea alongwith some of the holy relics, including golden candlesticks whichNebuchadnezzar had taken from them.They now expected the Messiah to appear and lead them to theirtrue destiny, although many Jews stayed in Babylon and other areasand did not choose to return to the promised land. The idea of aMessiah came from the Persians and from either there or Egypt theyabsorbed the belief in the resurrection of the physical body and thatof a million years of righteousness. Palestine was ruled by thePersians, but the Jews were allowed to re-build the temple inJerusalem and have their own religious hierarchy controlled by theJewish people. The influence of Babylon in Jewish thought and beliefcontinued to grow. Under the guidance of two men called Ezra andNehemiah the Jewish society became a little more civilised. Bothwere greatly influenced by their time in Babylon where they heardthe Chaldean stories of the Tower of Babel (Babylon), the GreatFlood, and Noah. Ezra re-wrote the Book of the Law which had beendestroyed when the temple was ransacked and the laws he says weregiven to Moses were no more than the beliefs Ezra picked up inBabylon like the Sabbath (Sabatu) and the idea that the Creatorrested on the seventh day.Jewish influence grew across the Middle East and they expandedtheir numbers into many areas. The Greeks gave them the nameHebrews which means the ‘people from the other side’ (of theMediterranean.) Some of the Jewish texts were translated intoGreek. The Jews became traders, valuers, moneylenders andpawnbrokers, buying and selling primarily rather than producing.Alexander the Great, a man similar in attitude to King David, tookover the Macedonian empire from his father and conquered Egyptand the land we know as Palestine. On the death of Alexander oneof his generals, Ptolemy I, took over Jerusalem. This wasn’t difficultbecause he attacked on the Sabbath and the Jews refused to fight ontheir holy day. The Greek influence on the people of Jerusalemincreased and a dispute developed between the Hellenised (Greekinfluenced) Jews and those who wished to retain the old waysofJehovah. Conflict erupted and in walked the King of Syria,Antiochus IV, to assume power inJerusalem. How ironic as wechronicle this constant bloodshed that Jerusalem translates as ‘Cityof Peace’. Antiochus tried to force the pagan customs of Greeceonto the believers in Jehovah and he insisted they worship a god"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"60called Jove. A bloodbath ensued as the supporters of Jehovahresisted.The theme of constant conflict will be seen throughout humanhistory. The Luciferic consciousness and the human expressions ofthat consciousness do not care what causes the conflict. A sense ofreligious or racial superiority, greed, a lust for power, anything willdo. They will support a nation when it suits them and cause it to bedestroyed when it doesn’t. All they want is for negative energy to beproduced in abundance to serve the master, Lucifer, and for humanityto remain so divided and awash with fear and the pressure of everyday life that they won’t open their minds for long enough to see whothey are and what is really going on. I am not going to keep labouringthis point through the rest of our brief history of humankind, exceptwhere I feel it needs to be highlighted. But keep in mind through allthat follows how conflict and division are the aims of thedisharmonious consciousness and anything that causes that serves itspurpose. Often this will be stimulated by a direct attack on humanminds by the Luciferic consciousness which manipulates the negativehuman emotions of ego, greed, and a wish for power. You don’t haveto affect many people to start a war, given that for most of humanhistory the decision of one king, queen, or dictator can decide thefate of millions who have no desire to fight. And you only have toaffect the thinking of one side because once they attack, the otherside has to defend itself and war has begun. You can start a war byaffecting the mind of one person and if he or she happens to be anincarnation of the Luciferic consciousness its child’s play. Thenegative secret societies of the Brotherhood in their many forms havehad an important role in the artificial creation of conflict by pullingthe strings behind the scenes and whenever possible getting itsmembers and followers into positions of power. Because it is has somany levels of initiation, one level can manipulate the lower levelswho have no idea of the agenda being followed by their ‘superiors’.This very much applies to politicians today. In this way, people canhelp to start a conflict when they have no wish to do so. Say abrotherhood member is told of a plan by Nation A to attack Nation Bor to undermine it in some way. That member might be persuaded towarn the leaders of nation B of what was going on. The memberwould do this out of the best of intentions. But he wouldn’t know thatanother member from a different branch of the brotherhood wastelling Nation B exactly the same about Nation A. Those brotherhood"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"61members believe they are doing the right thing, but they won’t knowthat they are being used to start a conflict that would not have startedotherwise. Once you have organisations based on secrecy and levelsof initiation that the lower rungs know nothing about, a very fewpeople can control the rest, most of whom might be lovely humanbeings who do not wish harm to anyone. So it is with thebrotherhood. That may sound simplistic and these things are oftenmore complex, but the basic themes of manipulation, agents,provocateurs, and secret brotherhood assassinations calculated to stirup conflict have been behind so much of the horror that has plaguedthe human story.The invaders of Jerusalem were eventually removed, but internalstrife continued between two factions of the Jewish religion, thePharisees and the Sadducees. The Romans captured Judea andJerusalem in 63Bc and after a bitter conflict they imposed on thepeople an Arab Prince called King Herod in 37Bc. Most members ofthe Sanhedrin, the Jewish Council and highest court ofjustice,opposed Herod and they were killed once he gained control. He alsocrushed the power of the Sadducees for their opposition to him andthe Pharisees rose to ascendancy. Herod died in 4Bc and the internalconflict returned. The Romans assumed control and ruled through aseries of procurators, one of which was called Pontius Pilatus.It was into this time and against this political and religiousbackdrop that a child was born called Jeshuah. The stories of his lifewould later be translated into Greek and it was then that the JewishJeshuah became the Greek version, Jesus. So the one thing we knowfor sure about Jesus is that his name wasn’t Jesus! I will, however,continue to use that name here for simplicity and because it reallydoesn’t matter what he was called. It is what he did that is important.He was, I believe, born and brought up as an Essene. For twohundred years before his birth a group called the Essenes orTherapeutae (meaning healers) had lived in Egypt and Palestine.They were inspired by the Buddhist philosophy more than the Jewishand it is likely that their beliefs originated in India, although theymust also have been influenced by Egyptian thought as well. It ispossible that Buddha, Socrates, and Jesus were the sameconsciousness and certainly the same overall higher self.The Jewish historian of the first century AD, Josephus, describedthe Essenes as the most honest people in the world and he said theyfollowed the values ofjustice and equality at all times. They were"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"62vegetarians and opposed animal or human sacrifice. They had a verydifferent approach to life to the prevailing attitudes of the time. TheEssenes had a number of centres in Egypt and Palestine and other laymembers who lived in the general community, but they are bestknown for their settlements at Qumran alongside the Dead Sea wherethe Dead Sea Scrolls were found in 1947 and further down the shoreat the giant flat-topped Mountain called Masada. It was here that theJews rebelling against Roman rule would commit mass suicide ratherthat be captured in 73AD. I visited both places in a short, butunforgettable visit to Israel in 1993, as described in myautobiography. The love I felt flowing through me at those points wasindescribable. At Qumran I found myself speaking the words: ‘Iforgive them everything’, although I did not know why I said that orwhere the words came from.The Essenes were a brotherhood who worked a great deal in secret.But as I continue to stress, secrecy does not always mean conspiracyin times of great religious imposition. There have been times whenkeeping your beliefs and knowledge secret has been essential to yoursurvival. I don’t believe the Essenes were the perfect people they aresometimes claimed to be, but overall I feel quite good about themand, anyway, I think Jesus was such a strong character that he wouldhave made his own mind up about things and not blindly acceptedanother belief system. In the American west there was once a farmercalled Maverick who refused to brand his animals. The wordmaverick became used to describe people who refuse to be brandedand linked to one organisation or group. I think that under thatdefinition of the word, Jesus was a maverick.I believe that the man known as Joseph of Arimathea could havebeen the father ofJesus and not his uncle as the stories claim. This isa thought which keeps coming to me again and again, and othershave channelled this information. No one knows the background forsure, and it can only be speculation, but it is clear that Joseph ofArimathea was very close to Jesus. Joseph was an Essene, as wasMary, and the Essenes possibly told her of a child she was beingasked to conceive with Joseph of Arimathea to ensure that the rightgenetic combinations interacted. The Essenes believed this childhad been foretold and Mary, then only a young girl of perhapsfourteen, agreed. The Joseph who is called her husband in thegospels became the guardian of Jesus and fathered other childrenwith Mary. But the genetic father of Jesus was I feel Joseph of"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"63Arimathea. This was a closely guarded secret known only to a few.Joseph of Arimathea was a rich landowner and businessman and amember of the Jewish Council, the Sanhedrin. Keeping his closefamily connections to Jesus a secret was vital if he was to play hispart in the overall plan.We are looking here again at a highly significant incarnation ofthe volunteer consciousness. The story of Jesus and others in theMiddle East was only part of what was happening at that time. Allover the world other volunteers had incarnated to co-ordinate theirwork. They would not have known what was happening inPalestine, most of them anyway, but all would have beencoordinated from a higher level in the same way that it is happeningtoday. The early years ofJesus were spent with the Essenes inQumran and in Egypt opening up to his true self, and rememberingwho he was and why he was here. He would have been fed rubbishalong with the enlightened explanations and it would have been upto him to see the difference. Nothing changes. Jesus travelledfurther afield in the so called ‘lost years’ which are left blank by theBible. He passed through Mesopotamia on his way to India andKashmir and he was further influenced by the words of Buddha.(See A Search for the Historical Jesus by Prof. F. Hassnain) Hespent several years with Buddhist thinkers and greatly impressedthem with his knowledge and understanding. He also journeyed toGreece and England. He may have travelled to Glastonbury andother places in England with Joseph of Arimathea who imported tinfrom Cornwall. All the time he was learning - remembering - andpassing on this knowledge.He was also channelling highly potent energies into the Earth’senergy grid. He had an energy field which allowed him to channelenergies of immense power which would have ‘fried’ most otherpeople. I am not saying for a moment that Jesus understoodeverything that was happening and exactly why he was doing certainthings. He would have simply felt impelled to do them. Certainly hewould have known the potential consequences of returning from histravels to Palestine to challenge the political, economic, and religiousstatus quo, but the urgings of his higher self would have been almostimpossible to ignore and he would have done many things without, atthe time, knowing why. It is like that feeling we have when we knowsomething is going to have an unpleasant outcome, but somehow wego on walking into it. Know the feeling? Me, too."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"64His open and verbal challenge to the established and destructiveorder was an effort to wake people up by appealing directly to theirlower consciousness. If the higher consciousness could notcommunicate powerfully enough with the lower consciousness of thepeople then one way around that isto channel information throughanother person, in this case Jesus, so he could speak directly to thelower consciousness by voice to ear. This is what all spiritualcommunicators come to do. I feel the area around Palestine, Egypt,and the Middle East was the centre of the temporary energy gridcreated after the end of Atlantis and if the consciousness of thepeople could be raised in that part of the world it would have aconsiderable effect on the planet, as would direct energy channellinginto the grid at that point. These were the twin tasks of Jesus andthose around him.It was, to say the least, not easy to achieve. Incarnating into thethick fog of negative, imbalanced, energy that was engulfing thisplanet made it even tougher. I know there are some who believe thateverything that happens on Earth is meant to be and part of somegrand Divine Plan. I don’t believe that. I feel most strongly that whatwe see on Earth is evolution that has taken an unfortunate andunnecessary turn caused by this period of Luciferic opportunity andthe ability of the higher levels to affect the dense physical world isnot always that easy. There is a basic plan for what needs to be done,but there is also much ad4ibbing that goes on in reaction to humanbehaviour. Much of this behaviour is not the work or design of theSource or our own higher selves. It is the consequence of thenegative energy imbalance, the density of this frequency, theLuciferic consciousness, and the utter nonsense which is passed onthrough the generations to indoctrinate each new generation of lowerselves with the same nonsense. So it was at the time ofjesus.I believe the idea that this man had to be nailed to a cross and diehorribly for somejudgmental God to agree to forgive all the sins ofhumanity to be the most monumental nonsense I have ever heard. Itnever ceases to amaze me how many believe it. I feel the power andprivilege that Jesus was challenging conspired to silence him. Thereligious hierarchy worked with the Romans who also didn’t wantthis trouble maker to go on making waves. Forces ofoccupation,whether physical, economic, or mental, know that people who thinkfor themselves are dangerous; and people who encourage others to dothe same are even more so. All the time the Luciferic consciousness"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"65is seeking to work through these people to achieve its ends. Jesuswas nailed to a cross, the Roman punishment at the time, but I do notbelieve he died there.From what I and others have channelled and written, I believe thefollowing is at least quite close to the truth. Joseph of Arimathea wasa central player in the plan to ensure that Jesus did not die on thecross. He owned the area known as the Garden of Gethsemane nearthe Mount ofOlivesjust outside the city walls of Jerusalem. As amember of the Jewish Council, the Sanhedrin, he would have knownexactly what was being said about Jesus. Another Essene member ofthe Sanhedrin, the one called Nicodemus, also secretly supportedJesus and helped him as best he could. He, too, was an Essene. In factthere was a secret group of Essenes unrecorded by history whoworked on behalf ofJesus and the overall plan far more effectivelythan those called the ‘disciples’. At least most of them did not knowthe full story of what was going on most of the time because the morewho knew the more chance there was of something slipping out thatwould have ruined everything.Jesus, Joseph, and other Essenes devised a plan unknown to thedisciples and even his mother Mary and his close companion,possibly his wife, Mary Magdalene. The plan was for Jesus tosurvive the cross. There were three main reasons for this, though nodoubt there were others: (a) To take the pressure off those who weresupporters ofjesus, including the Essenes, because there were many,including the Romans, who were moving towards the belief that itwas necessary to remove them. The public death and humiliationofJesus, their focal point, would disperse this growing desire for awholesale removal of his supporters and family. Joseph would haveknown this because of his close links with the Sanhedrin. He mighteven have suggested this course of action as an alternative way ofdestroying this challenge to the status quo.(b) They knew that people who question convention often havemore influence on thinking when they are dead (or are believed to bedead) than they do when they were alive. Take the example ofConfucius, for instance. (c) To go through great pain and trauma withthe intent of helping the Earth and humanity creates the energy oflove in quite fantastic amounts and power. And on the land owned byJoseph of Arimathea was one of the key points on that central heartof the post-Atlantean grid. It was on this point that the crucifixionwould take place."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"66Jesus knew all this and being a brilliant medium in constant touchwith the higher levels he would have channelled the basic themes.His secret group put together the plan under spiritual inspiration andthe higher frequencies were at work from their realms helping tomake it happen as required. The timing had to be perfect. Those whowere crucified were left on the cross for as long as it took for them todie, usually up to three days. Unless there was some way around that,Jesus could not possibly have survived. The only way of shorteninghis time on the cross was to ensure that it happened in the hoursbefore the Saturday, the Jewish Sabbath. No-one was allowed to beexecuted and buried on that day and anyone still alive on the crosswas killed before the start of the Sabbath. The usual method was tobreak their legs with a series of blows. This was fatal to anyonenailed by the wrists to a cross for rather gruesome reasons I won’t gointo. Therefore they had to find a way of giving the appearance thatJesus was dead before the end of the Friday.Jesus made his entrance into Jerusalem to coincide with the timinghe and Joseph had worked out. He was intentionally provocative,openly and publicly castigating the money lenders in the Temple, andgenerally stirring up discontent with the Jewish and Romanauthorities. He wanted to make them act against him immediately.The much-maligned Judas was crucial to the plot, too. He was in onthe plan and he ‘betrayed’ Jesus at the moment necessary to maintainthe strict timing of the sequence of events. In the background, Josephand Nicodemus, were working away within the Sanhedrin to ensurethey were reacting to schedule.The arrest ofJesus and the questioning by the Jewish hierarchy, andPilate followed the predicted time sequence and he was sentencedand nailed to the cross on the Friday. The crucifixion took place at aspot which adjoined the Garden of Gethsemane, owned by Joseph ofArimathea. IfJesus was thought to be still alive by the end of that dayhe would have been killed to avoid running over into the Sabbath.The Essenes were well known for their knowledge of herbs andplants which they used in their healing. It would have been noproblem for them to provide a mixture that would give theappearance of physical death. Indeed there are many documentedexamples of such drugs in ancient cultures, including one calledToska, a drink made of sour wine and wormwood. It was given byJewish women to those being crucified to help them loseconsciousness. Again at the right time, a drug was given to Jesus on a"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"67sponge which was put to his mouth with the excuse of giving him adrink. Soon after this he appeared to expire. The emphasis is on theword ‘appeared’ because although he was exhausted and in great painand distress, he was still alive. One unfortunate event which had notbeen foreseen was when a soldier pierced his side after he was takendown. This produced much blood, another indication that he wastaken from the cross alive. In the hours before his apparent death’ hewas the focal point in a vast energy channelling being coordinated bythe higher levels right across the world. Volunteers incarnate in allcultures were involved although they would not have been aware thatwhat they were doing was being mirrored all over the planet.Joseph of Arimathea went immediately to Pilate and asked forpermission to remove the body of Jesus for burial. Pilate agreedafter registering his surprise that Jesus had died so quickly andasking for confirmation. In preparation for what was to happen,Joseph had built a tomb in the Garden of Gethsemane so that Jesuscould be taken from the cross to the safety of the tomb as quickly aspossible. The quicker it happened the less chance there was thatsomeone would realise what was going on and the sooner he couldbe given medical treatment the better. A large stone was pushedacross thQ. entrance to ensure no one could see what was going oninside. Waiting in the tomb when Jesus was brought in were Essenehealers in white robes and they began the healing processimmediately.Jesus was in a bad way, but the healers stabilised his condition.Under cover of darkness, the stone at the entrance to the tomb waspushed back and Jesus was taken to the Essene Community at Qumran via a safe house. After a long convalescence, he recovered andleft the region with Joseph and the two Marys to continue the workof energy channelling and passing on information. I feel he travelledto places like Italy, Crete, France, and India where he might havedied a very old man in Kashmir. Some researchers believe he wasknown by many names to different peoples and in Kashmir he wasYuzu Asaph. His tomb is still there. However, others believe thatJesus ended his life in France. During a vision of the crucifixionwhich I had on one occasion, I channelled a series of short sentenceswhich said:“Essenes, Qumran. Time to recover. Illusion complete. Oppositionbelieve I am dead. Much travel. Long lifetime. Three children by two"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"68women.”Surviving a crucifixion may sound far-fetched, but Josephus thehistorian documents a story of a man known to him who was takendown from the cross alive and survived. Josephus knew the manand pleaded with the Roman commander, Titus, for him to bespared. Titus agreed and the man was taken from the cross andgiven medical treatment. Still today in the Phillipines there arepeople who agree to be nailed to the cross as part of some bizarreritual to confirm their faith and when they are taken down aftersome hours they recover. So it was possible to survive a crucifixionif you were not subjected to that horror for too long. Rememberalso that other levels would have been working to help Jesus duringthat time and giving to him the energies and strength to keep himincarnate.The disciples, as I mentioned, were not in on the plan, apart fromJudas who was considered, rightly as it turned out, to be the mosttrustworthy! When the tomb was found to be empty and the greatstone pushed back, it was assumed the body had been stolen and laterby some that Jesus had been resurrected. i.e. That his physical bodyhad gone to Heaven. In fact he was recovering in a safe house withhis Essene healers before being taken on to Qumran. Jesus had usedthe Jewish belief in a Messiah figure and the predictions of previousJewish prophets to create interest in himself and therefore his words.It was like building a public platform from which he could speak histruths. He would stress how events in his life had been written in theancient prophecies, but he and his secret support group were creatingthose events so they would match the prophecies. It was part of theplan to use the Jewish belief system to create interest and notoriety.Most of the disciples were not aware of this. Their inability tocommit themselves totally to the work and understand its importancefrustrated him and he was much closer to Joseph and his secretgroup. The ones called the disciples were a sort of ‘front’ for whatwas really going on behind the scenes and for that to work andappear credible it was vital that they had no knowledge of what washappening. They were very important to the work, but only if theydidn’t know the full story.The plan worked magnificently in that everyone was fooled andJesus achieved what he and his family and supporters came toachieve in relation to the energy grid. He also left behind a lot of"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"69people who were moved and motivated by his simple truths aboutlove, Creation, and the eternal nature of all consciousness. Themyths that were now to surround him made him far better knownthan ever he was in his lifetime in Palestine. No mention has beenfound of him in the works of the history writers of the time and yetlook what has been written about him since his life was highjackedby the religion called Christianity. Others have channelled and seenthe same basic story that I have outlined and researchers workingpurely from historical information (plus some higher inspiration)have come up with the same themes, too. What I have no doubtabout are the following: The overall reason for the Jesusincarnation; that he did not die on the cross; and that he was notcelibate. I feel he was married to or at least the close companion ofMary Magdalene with whom he had children and that he fathered achild with at least one other woman, possibly Mary Magdalene’ssister, Martha. This might make some Church people reel back inhorror, but the energy patterns that Jesus brought into incarnationwould not have been wasted. They would have been passed onthrough the genetic line. This could well have meant that he neededto interact physically with more than one other energy field to createparticular energy and genetic combinations. I talk more of thisprocess of sexual interaction and the many reasons for it in mybook, Heal The World.We should not forget, I feel, that Jesus was only one of thevolunteer incarnations, although a highly significant one. He playedan effective and couragous part in helping the Earth and humanity,but so have millions of others. It has been a continuous, on-going,process and not something that happened only once 2,000 years ago.He was very much a man of this physical level while being in closecontact with his higher self. He had the emotions of compassion,love, and at times anger. He spoke his mind and the idea that he wentaround in some spiritual mist talking kindly to everyone is well wideof the mark, I would say. Yes, he was kind to people and he had greatlove for the Earth and humanity, but sometimes love involvesspeaking out vehemently against injustice if that is what is necessaryfor change to happen and for people to awaken. It is such an ironythat it is the way his lifetime was to be misrepresented that has madehim the most famous of the volunteer incarnations.After Jesus left Palestine with the two Marys, Joseph of Arimatheaand others, the followers of his teachings Uesuians) were, apart from"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"70the Essenes, small offshoots of the Jewish religion like the Gnosticsand Ebionites. There was no overall belief system and they eachheld different views about the details and meaning of his life. Mostof them did, however, believe in his return or Second Comingwhich is an ancient idea that goes back to Sun worship. Once againthese early groups ofJesus followers were guided by channellersand you can see these referred to in the ancient texts as ‘vessels’ forthe holy spirit who were filled with the ‘Spirit of the Lord.’ We readof people being filled with the Holy Spirit and then speaking thewords of the Lord. Anyone who has experienced or witnessedchannelling will know that an energy descends upon the channeller.This is the communicating consciousness enveloping andsynchronising with the physical vehicle or vessel through which itseeks to communicate. It is this energy which channellers andonlookers feel that became termed the ‘holy spirit’ in ancient times.These Jesus-inspired groups were much like a spiritualist Church oftoday with people gathered to hear the communications of themedium, the ones blessed with ‘charismata’, the Greek word forpsychic abilities.It was only when the man we call St Paul came on the scene thatJesus, the wise and courageous philosopher, healer, and channel, wasturned into the pagan saviour-god depicted by Christianity. Paul wasan orthodox Jew who persecuted those sects which followed a beliefin the philosophy ofJesus. This changed dramatically after heclaimed to have seen a vision ofJesus on the road to Damascus. Thiscould have been a psychic vision of an non physical entity, or a three-dimensional holographic figure projected from a spacecraft, or hecould have made it all up. But the latter is unlikely because from thenon he clearly believed that Jesus was communicating with him andasking to be proclaimed Messiah and Saviour of the World. Paul wasfollowing the age old custom of people believing that every ghostthey saw or psychic communication they experienced was from God,the Highest One, or in this case God’s ‘son’. What appallingconsequences this was to have.We should remember that Paul came from a place called Tarsus inAsia Minor and there they worshipped a Greek pagan Saviourgodcalled Dionysus - their version of Bel. Dionysus was said to havebeen born to a virgin impregnated by the god Zeus and suffered anddied to save humanity. Paul clearly saw Jesus as another incarnationof Dionysus, the one he was taught to worship in Tarsus. All he did"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"71was transfer the myths about Dionysus to the philosopher calledJesus. Dionysus was the Greek Christ and the second in a trinity ofDemeter, Dionysus, and Persephone in the same vein as other pagangods throughout the Middle East. Dionysus was known as ‘OurLord’, ‘the Vine’, ‘the Saviour’, ‘the Judge of the Dead’, ‘theDeliver’, ‘the Born Again’, and ‘the Only Begotten Son of God’.Above the head of Dionysus were depicted the words ‘I am Life,Death, and Resurrection, I hold the winged crown . He is alsoclaimed to have said: ‘I am at one with my father in heaven’, and aservice called the Eukharistia which involved animal sacrifice wasperformed in his honour. Paul was fundamentally influenced by theGreek Mystery brotherhood) beliefs and saviour god myths and thesebecame fused in his mind with Jewish dogma. It is also possible thatPaul was influenced by the Greek mystery schools. If they werecontrolled by the negative aspects of the Brotherhood at the time,they could have set him up and mind-controlled him to do what hedid, and believe what he saw (or didn’t) was Jesus. The lamb dyingso our sins could be forgiven would have been a basic part of hisbelief system and he would have had no trouble linking this ancientpagan myth to Jesus. People who were sacrificed on the altars forthousands of years were seen in the same light. From thesebeginnings did Paul found what became the Christian Faith. Jesusdidn’t start Christianity. Paul did. I am not suggesting for a momentthat Saul of Tarsus (St Paul) set out to cause all the horrors that hismisunderstandings would create. He probably did it with the best ofintentions and believed everything he said. I am sure the same can besaid for most of those who followed him as guides and manipulatorsof the Christian faith. They, themselves, were being manipulated.Paul set off on his travels to tell people what Jesus was sayingthrough him and his letters are reported in the New Testament. Hemade his living making tents on his journeys and three years after hesaw his ghost or vision, or whatever it was, he arrived in Jerusalem tomeet the disciple Peter and James, the brother of Jesus. They didn’tthink much of him and they opposed his views about Jesus. Pauladmits he never knew or met Jesus in his lifetime, but he believedJesus was now speaking to him from the world of the gods. This, hethought, made him much more knowledgeable about him than thedisciples. There was a split between the believers in Jesus as a manand philosopher and the Pauline Christians who followed his belief ina recycled Dionysus, who was said to have been born on December"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"7225th. This relates to the ancient cult of the Sun God in which theperiods of mid-Winter, mid-Summer, and the solstices and seasonswere seen as sacred times. Paul’s Christianity was to win the dayand pagan priests were absorbed into his Church. They had noproblem being converted, because to them Jesus was just anotherpagan Saviour-god in the image of those they were used to. Withtheir arrival Christianity became even more paganised.The pagan religion called Mithraism was also absorbed into thePauline version of Christianity. Mithraism worshipped the saviour-god, Mithra, (see Dionysus, Bel, Osiris, Krishna, ad infinitum) andthey celebrated his birthday on December 25th, the beginning oftheir Winter. Names like Mithra and Dionysus were simplychanged to Jesus and so we have the Christian Christmas Day.Mithra was also believed to have risen from the dead at Easter andthe pagans-turned-Christian-pagans welcomed that Festival intothe Christian belief system. According to the Mithraists, Sundaywas ‘the Lords Day’ and the Eucharist, the baptism of babies, theidea of father, son, and holy spirit, the virgin mother giving birth tothe saviour, the marriage service and so much more were takenfrom various streams of paganism and added to Christianity. Thesepagan beliefs were a mixture of extra-terrestrial ‘gods’,channelling and visions, the movement of the Sun through theseasons and the sky, and downright make-believe. As we haveseen, the idea ofJesus as ‘the lamb of God’ dying so our sins couldbe forgiven goes back to the pagan animal sacrifices in which thelamb was said to take the place of humanity to quell the anger ofthe gods. Mithraism was now Myth-raism - better known asChristianity.It is worth pointing out that far from claiming that Jesus was bornby divine intervention without intercourse, the oldest Greek andSyrian manuscripts say ‘Joseph begat Jesus’. The idea of the virginbirth was a later insertion, as were all the additions that fostered themyth that Jesus the philosopher was Christ the saviour-god. Even theword Christ is of pre-Christian origin as Chrest (Egypt) and Christos(Greek). The story of the virgin birth of the Egyptian Son of God,Horus, has been found on a temple wall in Luxor and that wasdepicted long before Christianity was even thought of. In these earlyyears of the Christian Church many changes were made to texts tojustify the inventions. Words were attributed to Jesus which said: ‘Hethat believeth and is baptised shall be saved, but he that believeth not"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"73shall be damned’. This was added to increase the power of theChurch and the priests.The priests took over the Pauline version of Jesus and this was suchan enormous irony given that Jeshuah, the Jewish philosopher,challenged the whole idea of priests. The original Jesuian form ofworship was overpowered by what became Christianity, thatmisguided mixture of pagan and Jewish myths and stories, some ofwhich carry themes of symbolic and hidden truth, many of which areutter rubbish. Only the names changed, not the stories and myths.Cyprian, who died in 258, was the Bishop of Carthage and he didmore than most to secure the priestly takeover. It was he whopromoted the belief that only those who became Christians wouldhave salvation. He said people should not have their own opinions -only those which the Church decided they should have. What powerthis would give to the priests in the centuries that followed to servethe desires of the Luciferic master.The values of the brave and brilliant philosopher, healer, andchannel called Jeshuah had been all but obliterated by Paul’s recycledpaganism and the darkness of ignorance and pain was to descendupon the human race for nearly two thousand years. This happenedafter Christianity’s most important victory, its acceptance as the stateChurch of the Roman Empire. For that we have to thank, though thatis hardly the word, a Roman Emperor called Constantine the Great."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"745Hell on EarthCONSTANTINE I became Emperor of all the Roman lands in 312and within thirteen years he had, in effect, decided the future formuch of humanity for nearly two millennia.Constantine ‘the Great’ as he was to become known, served as asoldier and won a reputation for courage and military prowess. Afterspending some time serving in Britain he was elected by his army asCaesar of the West. He determined to be Emperor of all, and beganthe process of killing his rivals and sometimes their children, too.The Christian legend is that at the scene of one of his battles for theRoman throne he had a vision of a cross. It was at the battle ofMilvian Bridge, near Rome and he is said to have seen the cross inthe sky with the words ‘By this Conquer’. The following night he isclaimed to have seen a vision of Jesus who told him to put the crosssymbol on his flag to guarantee victory over his enemies. Yes, thatsounds like just what the Prince of Peace would say, doesn’t it?This whole story is probably another Christian invention, but forsome reason Constantine began to look kindly on the Christians. TheBrotherhood would have been working behind the scenessomewhere, I feel sure. Constantine issued the Edict of Milan whichstopped the persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire. SomeChristians had been persecuted horribly in earlier years althoughGibbon, the historian who made a study of this, concluded that thenumbers have been greatly exaggerated. He believes something like2,000 Christians were murdered and tortured in the pre-Constantineperiod while 25 million are estimated to have been executed in thecenturies that followed for the crime of not accepting the Christianfaith. Both figures are terrible, but it puts what was to unfold intosome perspective.Constantine thought a cross was a lucky mascot after his vision’,and in fact the cross as a religious symbol goes back to the time when"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"75humans discovered that by rubbing two sticks together you can makefire. They believed that fire was a god and two crossed sticks were seenas sacred. The cross can be found on ancient graves and it was areligious symbol in Egypt, Assyria, Persia, India, Mexico andScandinavia, long before Christianity. The Egyptians saw their cross, orcrux ansata, as symbolic of salvation and eternal life, and our old friendsthe Mithraists marked the foreheads of the newly initiated with the signof the cross. Ancient stories also describe how human sacrifices werebound to a cross and anointed with oil, so they would burn better on thealtar. From such bleak traditions has Christianity come.Constantine was never a Christian as such and he only agreed to bebaptised on his death bed, no doubt as a bit of insurance. Heworshipped both Jesus and the Greek god, Apollo, and he remainedthe head of the Pagan Church as Pontifex Maximus. But he gaveChristianity the same status as the others and made substantialdonations to its cause. Significantly he allowed the Church to receivelegacies which had been banned up to this point and from here theChristian Church would begin to accumulate fantastic wealth aspeople tried to buy a place in heaven. Constantine’s efforts toincrease the Christian ranks led to bribes for the poor if they becameChristians, and the offer of good jobs to wealthy Pagans whoconverted to the faith.Constantine became concerned when disputes began to eruptbetween different Christian beliefs. A churchman called Anus inAlexandria questioned the idea that Jesus was the same as God. Howcould a son be the same as his father and had notJehovah said thatonly he was God? When the Bishop of Alexandria, appropriatelynamed Alexander, was preaching about the trinity of father, son, andholy spirit, Anus publicly questioned him. You may not think itimportant in the great tapestry of life to decide ifJesus was only avehicle for God or part of three gods in one, but it now became thequestion that had to be decided. Anus left Alexandria for Palestine infear of his life and two factions emerged. Neither would give wayand this difference was being ridiculed throughout the Empire by thenon-believers and was no doubt fuelled by the Brotherhood.Constantine had wanted, at least in part for political reasons, to makeChristianity the state religion, but he could not do this unless thedisputes were settled.He called together the bishops at Nicaea which is now Iznik inTurkey where he had a palace. At their first meeting in June 325 no"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"76agreement could be reached between the 318 bishops on the burningissue of the day: was Jesus part of a trinity of father, son, and holyspirit? - whatever that was supposed to mean. Constantine arrivedshortly after murdering his wife and elder son. He moved theproceedings to his palace and presided over all that followed. He saida decision had to be reached because only when that happened couldChristianity be the state Church. It is clear he wasn’t much botheredwhat they decided as long they decided something. A bitter argumentbroke out between the factions as documents were torn up and blowswere struck. This is the atmosphere in which the Christian creed wasofficially decided. Constantine agreed to a motion which wasaccepted by the majority though vehemently opposed by Anus andhis supporters. It became known as the Nicene Creed and it read asfollows:“We believe in one God, the Father almighty, maker of all things,both visible and invisible; and in one Lord, Jesus Christ, the son ofGod, begotten of the Father, only begotten, that is to say, of the samesubstance of the Father, God of God and Light of Light, Very God ofVery God, begotten, not made, being of one substance with the father,by whom all things were made, both things in heaven and things onearth; who, for us men and for our salvation, came down and wasmade flesh, made man, suffered and rose again on the third day, wentup into the heavens, and is to come again to judge the quick and thedead; and in the holy ghost.”There is a saying which goes: ‘A camel is a horse designed by acommittee.’ If ever there was an example of that it is the above. I find itinteresting also that this official creed of Christianity talks of ‘for us menand our salvation’. What about women? But then it would only be in1545 that the Roman Church officially agreed that women had souls -and then only by a majority of three votes!The Jewish philosopher, healer, and medium called Jeshuah was nowofficially a saviour-god who, like the lambs on the pagan sacrificialaltars, died so that our sins could be forgiven forever as long as webelieve in him as our saviour and it is worth remembering that thisdecision on who Jesus was came 300 years after his death. It was alsomade by people who believed the Earth was flat and Jerusalem was thecentre of the Universe; this decision remains the foundations of theChristian Church to this day. Before the Council of Nicaea closed,"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"77Constantine agreed to a motion that Anus and his followers be officiallycursed and either executed, imprisoned, or banished. Other decreesapplied the same Christian justice to all who read any writings bythose who now became known as Arians. The Arian view is stillexpressed today, incidentally, by the Unitarians.Thousands of Arians were murdered, the first of the estimated 25million victims who would die in the name of Christianity and that isnot including those who would perish in religious wars and theestimated 12 million who were killed in the Christian conquest of theAmericas. Added together world-wide the number who perished as aresult of the Christian religion must easily pass 100 million. To beexcommunicated by the Church was almost a death sentence in itself,because you could not be guilty of murder if you killed someone whowas excommunicated. Anus, however, escaped death to continue toexpound his cause and the arguments went on over the trinity. Inabout 336 Constantine even ordered that Anus be readmitted to theChurch, but before this could be done Anus died in mysteriouscircumstances and the following year Constantine passed on, also.On his death bed he was baptised by a bishop who did not accept thetrinity. By then he had moved the capital of the empire from Rome toByzantium - now Turkey - and he built a new city which he calledConstantinople. It was about 44 miles from Nicaea. Here he had builtChristian churches and dedicated the city to the Virgin Mary andChristianity was to become the State Church of the Roman Empire.This Romanized Christianity was given the name RomanCatholicism. All that happened, in reality, was that the previousRoman state saviour, Mithra, was renamed Jesus Christ.Constantine’s mother, Helena, was sent to Jerusalem to find thebiblical sites and she claimed to have found the exact locations of thebirth ofJesus, his crucifixion, the tomb, and even where he ascendedinto the sky. It was on her say so that Constantine built a basilica in326 on the spot where she said Jesus had been crucified. The Churchof the Holy Sepulchre is on that site today and attracts millions ofChristian pilgrims to the place where Jesus hung on the cross. Or,rather, where Helena said it happened. She was obviously quite asleuth, because during her trip she claimed to have found the threewooden crosses involved in the crucifixion three hundred years afterthey were supposed to have been used!!The names of three people are worth emphasising in these earlyyears of the Christian Church - Augustine, Jerome, and Ambrose."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"78Arthur Findlay in his study of the Church likens them to the Nazis,Hitler, Goebbels, and Himmler. When you compare theirbackgrounds and behaviour, it is hard to argue against that, butbefore we start condemning them as individuals we need to ask who,or what, was in control of them? I would stress that I am notcondemning anyone in this book. I am looking at thought andbehaviour patterns which have guided human history and theindividuals involved are victims of those patterns as much as thepeople who suffered from their actions. Forgive them, they know notwhat they do, is a good line to remember when reading the next fewchapters. Augustine imposed a tyrannical rule and used force and fearto swell the Christian ranks. He would quote the words ofJesus tojustify his actions: ‘Compel them to come in, that my house befilled’, and ‘But those mine enemies, which would not that I reignover them, bring hither and slay them before me. These were quotedto excuse the murder or forced conversion of non-believers. Yet thesequotations, as with ‘I came not to send peace, but a sword’, andothers, were inventions. They were inserted into the texts asjustification of war, murder, and endless other horrors in the name ofthe ‘Prince of Peace’. Augustine sought to impose a global creed byexterminating the opposition. Religious ‘error’, he said, must betreated like treason, a crime against the state, and be punished assuch. He said that babies who died before they were baptised would,like all the unbaptised, be condemned to hell for all eternity, and heused fear of death and the fear of hell and damnation after death, toexpand his vicious and ignorant creed. He would, like Jerome andAmbrose, later be declared a saint.Jerome, born in 341, was the man responsible for producing thetexts for the first ‘Holy’ Bible. It was he, also, who led the campaignof persecution against the mediums and channellers who had been atthe centre of religious belief from the very start of human existence.In a short time, the gift of communicating with other frequencieswould be a death sentence. The channellers were replaced by thepriests as the ‘middle men’ between God and humanity. Channellerswho were frauds in the past had made up communications to makethe people do whatever they wished, and now the priests would dothe same without the need to stage a fraudulent channelling. But, asalways, there were many genuine channellers who werecommunicating with other levels, and their communicators wereopposing the Church’s beliefs and behaviour. They had to be shut up"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"79and they were. Countless numbers were tortured and murdered aswitches. Priestly rule had arrived. As Jerome put it:“We tell them (the channellers) that we do not so much rejectprophecy (channelling), as refuse to receive prophets (channellers)whose utterances fail to accord with the Scriptures old and new.”In other words we don’t mind people channelling as long as whatthey communicate supports what we have decided is truth. And as theChurch had control of the ‘scriptures’ they could change whateverthey liked to support their view. The philosopher Celsus wrote of thisin the third century. He said of the religious hierarchy:“You utter fables, and you do not even possess the art of makingthem seem likely... You have altered three, four, times and oftener thetexts of your own Gospels in order to deny objections made to you.”There were so many differing beliefs in the first three centuriesafter the life ofJesus that no two gospels or epistles (letters claimed tobe from apostles) were alike. Bits had been added, deleted, andchanged to fit the beliefs of those who possessed them. Modernresearch has shown that the text of Mark was the first of the ‘Bible’gospels to be written and the others merely copied that and put intheir own additions. Earlier texts from which Mark and other Gospelwriters copied have been lost, but even so there were other writingsabout Jesus which the Church rejected, as we will see. No one knowswho wrote the biblical texts, when, and from what personal directionthey were coming from. Yet this is the book that has controlled theevolution of much of the world for the best part of two thousandyears! Jerome’s suppression of truth and alternative thought was two-fold. He persuaded the Pope to make channelling a crime and theOracles and Vessels of God became with one Papal decree, Oraclesand Vessels of the Devil, names still used by many within the Churchtoday. And he also took control of the ancient texts and made them fithis image of truth. Jerome became secretary to Pope Damasus inabout 382 and he was commissioned to bring together all the varioustexts into a book which reflected (his) orthodox belief.It was now that the texts were made to fit the view that Jeshuah thephilosopher was no less than Jesus the Christ who had died so oursins would be forgiven. Jerome’s rewriting of ancient texts and the"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"80rejection of anything he didn’t agree with, produced the wordingwhich became the New Testament. Christians believe this to be theword of Jesus and God. It isn’t. It is largely the word of Jerome. Theadditions and deletions by Jerome and others created a contradictorymess. The Bible tells us, for example, that the genetic line ofJesuscan be traced back from his father Joseph to King David. But howcan this be ifjoseph played no part in his conception? In fact both thegenetic line and the idea of the virgin birth were additions to thetexts.Jerome and Augustine looked through thirteen gospels, nine actsand teachings of the Apostles, thirty-one epistles, and other writings,and decided which were ‘orthodox’ and which were not. Surprise,surprise, they agreed that the ones Jerome had doctored wereorthodox and the rest should be discarded, and it was these that theCouncil of Carthage agreed should be accepted by the Church. Someof those that were rejected were much nearer the truth than those thatbecame the New Testament. Pope Innocent I confirmed the decisionat Carthage, and a hundred years later Pope Gelasius I decreed thatonly these approved writings (called canonical) were to be read inchurches. Those who disobeyed were to be tortured and killed asheretics. Jerome also turned his mind to re-writing the texts thatbecame the Old Testament, but even his faith in these as the Word ofGod was challenged by all the contradictions he found. He had toadmit that his efforts to make sense of it could only be consideredmakeshift. When the two testaments were brought together in the 6thcentury the Old, which Jerome didn’t really understand, was joinedwith the New, which Jerome had edited to suit his beliefs. By thesemethods was the Holy Bible created and Jehovah, the vengeful Godof the Jews and quite possibly an extra-terrestrial, became mergedwith the God of Jesus. Is it any wonder that it produced a book so fullof blatant contradictions? Fortunately some themes of truth havesurvived and particularly some of the written and numerical symbolsand codes that the original texts contained. Many of these have beenretained because the forgers and editors like Jerome did notunderstand their significance. To them they were just numbers orliteral stories. But some are codes and symbols waiting for those whohave the understanding to decipher them.After Constantine’s death, there had been a period when Pagan andArian beliefs had their supporters among the Roman Emperors.During one period under the Emperor Constantius believers in the"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"81trinity were persecuted when he accepted the Arian view. Whoeverhad prominence it was still a case of Christians killing Christians inan argument over the trinity or no trinity. Then the EmperorTheodosius ‘the Great’ came to power in 379, and with him so didorthodox (Jeromian) Christianity. Theodosius was a staunchsupporter of the Nicene Creed who ordered the slaughter of 1,500men, women, and children on one occasion alone in retaliation forthe murder of one of his commanders and some soldiers. He issuedthe laws which were to be known as the Theodosian Code. Theseordered imprisonment, torture, death or banishment for the crime ofthe heresy of not accepting the Nicene Creed. He also appointed agroup of priests called The Inquisitors of the Faith. Ambrose, theBishop of Milan, was the founder of the Holy Inquisition which wasto turn a large tract of the world into a human abbatoir. Wars werefought over the imposition of the Christian Orthodox (Nicene) Faithand tens of millions would be killed in the most terrible ways in thename of Christianity. The Brotherhood organisations were beingcontrolled more and more by negative intent. They were gaining evergreater control of events as their membership, and offshoots grewever more quickly. Now the Luciferic Consciousness was not only incontrol of the Church, it was the Church. This was to continue intomodern times. The Inquisition Office is now called the Holy Office.The further erosion of truth came with the Emperor Justinian in the6th century. From his headquarters in Constantinople he schemed tohave references to pre-existence and reincarnation removed from theBible. He convened the Second Synod Council of Constantinople in553 which, even without the attendance or support of the Pope,agreed that:“If anyone assert the fabulous pre-existence of souls and shallsubmit to the monstrous doctrine that follows from it, let him be. .excommunicated.”The spiritual truths that were being passed on through theBrotherhood, at certain levels of it, anyway, were now destroyed inthe public arena. The ‘Great Work of Ages’ or, to give it its modernname, The New World Order, was right on course in its desire to parthuman beings from the knowledge of who they are.With the fall of the Roman Empire, the Christian Church took itsplace and the Pope became the equivalent of the Roman Emperor.

In the same way, becauseEve had tempted him to eat from the tree, women were considered tobe evil and of no worth. These breathtaking interpretations and thefear of the Inquisition was to hold back human evolution for at leasttwo thousand years. Today’s scientific establishment is still not asadvanced in its overall understanding of life and Creation as wereSocrates, Plato, and others in Ancient Greece.The Christians destroyed all the writings of the great philosophers.Plato’s Academy and Aristotle’s Lyceum were closed and theirwritings burned. The Roman educational system inspired byQuintilian was dismantled and the great library at Alexandriabecame a theological college. Philosophers, scientists, and schoolteachers were persecuted. Hypatia, one of the outstanding women ofher time, had her flesh torn from her body by a Christian mob forthe ‘crime’ of speaking eloquently on science, mathematics,astronomy, and philosophy in ways that contradicted orthodoxChristianity. She worked at the library in Alexandria and all thebooks it contained were then destroyed. This was all done in thename of Cyril, the Archbishop of Alexandria. He was later made asaint.I can recommend a book called The Vicars of Christ which is arecord of the Roman Catholic popes by a former Roman Catholicpriest, Peter Da Rosa. It is a superb expose of the hypocrisy anddeceit upon which Christianity was built. And remember, until theReformation and the birth of the Protestant version in the 16thcentury, the Roman Catholic Church was Christianity. The Vaticanhad a whole department dedicated to producing forged ‘historical’documents to hoodwink kings, queens, and others into doing theirwill. In most cases the Church’s ‘will’, as, increasingly, with theBrotherhood, was for them to wage war on non-believers or tohand over land and money to add to their, by now, amazingwealth.The post of Pope was not spiritual, but commercial, and thenegative Brotherhood societies made every effort to make sure that‘their’ men got the job or someone who was easily manipulated. The"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"83Vatican to this day is run by the Brotherhood. If they could controlthe Pope, the potential to create wars and impose their will wasalmost infinite. Popes were considered by many to be ‘infallible’, themouthpiece of God, and whatever they wanted they had to be given.As a result the Papacy attracted all the wrong characters for all thewrong reasons. One pope was so unhinged that he had the body of aprevious pope exhumed from the grave and brought to his room. Heordered that the rotting remains were sat down in a chair so he couldtell him what he thought of him! Apparently, one of the Pope’s staffstood behind the dead pope answering on his behalf like someventriloquist with a dummy. It is sobering to think that suchmisguided people were making decisions that would affect the livesof humanity up to the present day. Or was it always they who actuallymade the decisions? Probably not. Either way, we still have RomanCatholic priests who must stay celibate and unmarried because ofwhat popes - or their controllers - decided a thousand years ago andmore. The story went like this:325AD: The Council of Nicaea decides that no one will be allowedto marry after their ordination.385AD: Pope Siricius decrees that men who are married beforetheir ordination must not sleep with their wives afterwards.590 - 604AD: Pope Gregory the Great decides that all desire forsex is sinful. Sex was only for producing children.1074AD: Pope Gregory VII says that all priests must pledgethemselves to be celibate.The consequences of the Roman Catholic hang-ups about sex havebeen to pass on this ‘dirty’, ‘sinful’, view of sexual love to thegenerations that followed. Even today we still see its legacy. We arealso seeing many stories coming to light of Roman Catholic priestsand their sexual abuse of children. The Vatican seeks to avoidresponsibility for this, but at the core of such behaviour is the forcedsuppression of natural sexual urges imposed by Papal dictatorsbetween ten and seventeen centuries ago and upheld by successivePapal dictators ever since. But they can’t change it because to do sowould make it clear that Pope Gregory VII was fallible in orderingsuch a ridiculous rule. And as popes are considered infallible, none ofthem can change - at least publicly -’ what a previous one hasdecided!The idea of ‘sinful’ sex was promoted by Augustine. He was well-known for his love of sex earlier in his life, but when he claimed to"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"84have abstained, he took on a view of sex that was similar to the waysome people who stop smoking see others who continue to smoke.He became obsessive in his condemnation, and would not allow awoman to enter his house unaccompanied. This included his sister.Such was his power within the Church that his belief that sex and lustwere sinful became the accepted view. The suppression of the flow ofcreative energy activated by natural sexual activity has expresseditself in negative emotions and behaviour, as well as health problemsresulting from blocked energy. Using the ‘safe period’ to enjoy sexwithout conceiving was condemned as a wicked sin by Augustine.You should never have sexual relationships unless you intend toconceive a child, they decided, and even then under no circumstancesmust you enjoy it!! This nonsense continues to blight the lives of somany to this day. I have always found it hilarious that the Churchsays that God made the physical body, but we should be so ashamedof this creation that we must never allow others to see it or, at theextreme, even see it ourselves. But Augustine’s view on love,marriage, and sex was followed by the Church from then on. As hesaid over and over again:“Husbands love your wives, but love them chastely. Insist on thework of the flesh only in such measure as is necessary for theprocreation of children. Since you cannot beget children in any otherway [an oversight by God, presumably], you must descend to itagainst your will, for it is the punishment of Adam.”Poor old Adam and Eve. They get it in the neck for everything,even the fact that we have to be punished by being forced to havesex. Augustine linked sex with ‘original sin’, the idea that we are allborn sinful. If we are conceived through the sexual act, we are bydefinition born with original sin which is supposed to go back toAdam and Eve. Jesus was the only one born without original sin,because his was a virgin birth which did not involve sex. Follow thelogic? Later to overcome the obvious contradiction that Jesus wasborn to a mother who was born with original sin, she, too, was said tohave been conceived without sex. But hold on. In that case, Jesuswas born without original sin to a mother without original sin, butshe was born to a mother with original sin. Shock, horror. Unless ofcourse, the grandmother of Jesus was also conceived without sex. Inthat case.... No, no, I think we’ll leave it there. You see how"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"85confusing it gets once you try to cover your tracks? It is the samewhenever you tell lies. You have to keep lying to cover up previouslies and you get yourself in a terrible mess. The Roman Church alsoconveniently ignores the fact that the one they consider to be the firstpope, the ‘disciple’ Peter, was married and not celibate. From thisinsult to the intelligence has come a view of sex, the physical body,marriage, divorce, and women that was to prevail for nearly twothousand years. The suppression of women has been passed throughthe generations by the major religions. Christian dogma used theAdam and Eve story in the Jewish Old Testament to justify this. Theyalso quote people like St Paul:“Wives submit to your husbands for the husband is the head of thewife as Christ is the head of the Church. Now if the Church submits toChrist so should wives submit to their husbands in everything.”And:“But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over theman, but to be in silence.”In the last years of the 20th century, the Bible is still being quotedin opposition to women priests. When the Church of England votedin favour of women in the priesthood in 1993, members of theChurch resigned in protest and joined the Roman Catholics - some ofthem women! The male domination in all areas of life has helped toextend the domination of male energy over female which has madethe world what it is today. This has served Lucifer’s ambitionsmagnificently. A domination of male energy over female is vital tohis plans. All consciousness is both male and female, and we all havemale and female lives to ensure a balance of experiences. The currenttransformation will see a rebalancing of the male-female energiesaround the planet and this will manifest in the emergence of womenin decision making and the activation of female energies, like caringand compassion, within those in male bodies. Both men and womenare capable of expressing male and female energy.The Christian obsession with destroying paganism, while at thesame time absorbing it, led to a further polluting of the Earth energygrid, as did all the negative energy being created by the murder andmayhem. Early churches were built on Pagan sacred sites. Some sects"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"86knew about the energies and wanted to use them, and othersconsidered these energies and sites to be evil and wished to suppressthe energies (the ‘dragon’). This is where I feel the legends of StGeorge and the dragon originated. Churches all over the world arebuilt on acupuncture points and chakras and I visit many in thecourse of my own work. All that fear, guilt, and suffering which hasbeen experienced on those sites and the concentration on thecrucifixion have generated immense quantities of negative energyand this has poured into the grid. Those churches that have beenjoyous have produced positive energy, but they have been the tiny,tiny, minority.This was a terrible time for the volunteers and those who weretrying to restore understanding to the human mind. They incarnatedin other parts of the world for lives dedicated to channelling energyinto the grid to try to compensate for what Christianity and Islam (ofwhich more shortly) were doing. Those who were born into theChristian World lived simple lives keeping their heads down andchannelling the energy or doing what they could to speak out beforefacing the inevitable and often gruesome fate. Many foundthemselves guided to the monasteries which were built on energysites and were protected by law from any interference.One spiritual group which grew rapidly in France and NorthernItaly in the 12th and 13th centuries and challenged the power ofRome was the Cathars or Albigenses. It was based on anunderstanding of reincarnation and the eternal nature of allconsciousness. They were vegetarians and communicatedpsychically with other frequencies. Their views won such supportthat the influence of the Roman Catholic Church began to wane inSouthern France around Albi. Pope Innocent II reacted to this withone of the most appalling examples of inhumanity seen on thisplanet. What followed was genocide. Men, women and childrenwere dismembered or were burnt alive in the name ofJesus and God.The events at the castle of Monsegur are best remembered in theCathar story, but there were many other ‘glorious’ victories for theRoman Catholic armies that were just as sickening. One ploy ofInnocent II, and later of Pope Gregory IX was to tell his ‘crusaders’that no matter what they did he would forgive them on God’s behalf.What a shock they must have had when they left the physical bodyand realised they were responsible through karma for all they haddone."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"87As the centuries passed the Holy Inquisition went into overdrive.The Dominican Order was put in charge of this religious version ofMurder Incorporated. Pope Gregory IX declared: ‘It is the duty ofevery Catholic to persecute heretics’. There was no fair trial before asentence. The Inquisitors, decision was final. It was a wonderful wayof getting rid of people you didn’t like, especially if you were one ofthe Brotherhood elite who wished to remove those who were gettingin your way. You told the Inquisitors that your enemies were non-believers, and you stood back and watched them burned to death.This passage is from a book of guidance from the Church toinquisitors:“Either the person confesses and he is proved guilty from his ownconfession, or he does not confess and is equally guilty on theevidence of witnesses. If a person confesses the whole of what he isaccused of he is unquestioningly guilty of the whole; but if heconfesses only a part, he ought still to be regarded as guilty of thewhole, since what he has confessed proves him to be capable of guiltas to other points of the accusation.. Bodily torture is left to the Judgeof the Inquisition, who determines according to age, sex, and theconstitution of the party.. If not withstanding, all the means employed,the unfortunate wretch still denies his guilt, he is to be considered as avictim of the devil; and, as such, deserves no compassion from theservants of God, nor pity and indulgence of Holy Mother Church; heis a son of perdition. Let him perish among the damned.”Even genuine believers were murdered by the Inquisitors, but theChurch’s motto was that it was better for a hundred ‘innocents’ to diethan for one heretic to go on living. Could it be that the Nazis of the20th century were a reincarnation of these misguided minds I havebeen describing? The parallells in behaviour patterns and attitudesare clear to see, even in their treatment of the Jews. I believe that theprogramming by the Church of the collective conscious mind was sostrong that when people later reincarnated they dropped back into thesame thought patterns that had been programmed into them inprevious incarnations. This applies to the Church, economics, and allaspects of our lives, and I have no doubt the same is happening today.In incarnation after incarnation people drop back into old patternsthey cannot or chose not to break.

But if you use for a moment the Church’s definition ofheresy - the abuse and misrepresentation of the one they call Jesus -then the greatest of all heresies has been Christianity itself.The Christian thought-police were now established across theirdomain and they would soon spread their darkness to the Americas.The only threat to their domination of the Holy Land and beyond wasanother version of religious indoctrination which answered to thename of Islam.

His name wasMahomet or as he is better known, Mohammed.Again we have a psychic vision, a communication from anotherfrequency, or an extra-terrestrial hologram, being mistaken for Godor a messenger from God, and again it was to have appallingconsequences. Mahomet said that his communicator had told him thepeople of Arabia must return to a simple faith in Allah, the God ofAbraham (Allah = El and later Jehovah to the Hebrews). He said Godhad also chosen him to pass on this message, and those who acceptedit would be saved on Judgment Day. Sound familiar? All of theseapparently opposing religions were started by the same non-physicalmanipulator - Lucifer in his many forms. Mahomet was just anothervictim. He wrote down his communications in a book called theKoran (meaning recitation), and from that came the religion we knowas Islam (meaning submission to God) and the people called Muslims(one who submits). Terrible violence became the means of advancingMahomet’s cause. He changed in character from what would appearto have been a kind and loving man into a tyrant as his religiousbeliefs and a highly negative energy took him over. So what causedthis sudden change? It could have been that he simply became powerhungry, I suppose, but maybe there is another explanation. I do notoffer it as fact, just a possibility.Mahomet says that he saw his vision near the cave where he wouldoften go. The vision apparently claimed to be the angel Gabriel ofbiblical fame and he lost consciousness during the encounter. Otherprophet figures have told of similar experiences. When he woke upthe message he was told to recite was, he says, inscribed upon hisheart. Perhaps it would have been more accurate to say his mind. To"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"90appreciate what could have happened to Mohamet, St Paul,Augustine, and endless others, we need to make the division in ourminds between the stage of evolution humanity had reached at thetime and where the ET’s were in their knowledge and technology. Inthe modern world, highly sophisticated, mind-control techniques arewell known to the secret Brotherhood elite today and the intelligenceagencies who work to an agenda which ignores democraticgovernment and scrutiny. But even these techniques are primitivecompared with what the ETs can do and, more to the point, could dothousands of years ago across the entire period covered in this book.They could turn certain people into super robots, controlled almostentirely through mind programming. The CIA today have the abilityto abduct someone, implant a micro-chip in their brain, and sohypnotise them that another version of what happened can replacethe actual experience in their memory. Look at the differencebetween that level of knowledge and the stage of understandinghumans had reached in the periods we are discussing and you can seehow easy it would have been to control many events.I am not saying that this happened, I don’t know. But it would benaive to dismiss the possibility out of hand, in the light of what weknow about mind-controlling techniques today. Humans, rather thanETs, could well have been involved in affecting Mohamet’s mind.There are, of course, other explanations for his experience. Themost likely is some sort of psychic happening or manipulation, oreven drugs. Maybe he was genuinely the subject of efforts to passon spiritual knowledge and his ego took over. Part of the message hewrote down said: “Don’t use violence in religion,” only for this tobe removed from the Koran texts when he did just that. There is agreat deal of good sense to be found in the Koran among all thedross. What precisely happened to Mohamet, we can’t say, but onething is for sure - what followed his experience was anything butspiritual.Even before Mohamet the town of Mecca was considered areligious centre and attracted thousands of pilgrims. It had a smalltemple called the Kaaba (House of God) and its cornerstone was ameteorite. This was held to be sacred and the place of worship for thegod Allah Taala and images ofJesus, Mary, and others decorated thewalls. The Bedoums who owned the temple enjoyed a very profitablebusiness as the people paid to worship and kiss the sacred stone.They became very angry at the preachings of homet because if his"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"91ideas caught on they feared their trade would cease. To their dismayhe was gathering many followers and the town of Medina had askedhim to be their ruler as the prophet of Allah. Given what hashappened since, it is some irony to think that it was the Jews inMedina who helped to pursuade people that he was who he claimedto be. The Bedoums of Mecca plotted to kill him, but he escapedwith his close friend Abu Bekr and hid in his cave before returningto the safety of Medina in 622. Medina translates as ‘town of theProphet’.From his base in Medina he and his followers attacked and robbedthe trading caravans on their way to Mecca and conflict came to thisdesert region. Mahomet’s growing power and arrogance led him toannounce that God had told him the people in Medina who wouldnot accept his message should be killed. It was Christianityrevisited. All non-believers must die. Mahomet ordered manymassacres, including the murder of 900 Jews, and in the end a treatywas agreed between Mecca and Medina. Mecca would recogniseMahomet as the prophet of God if he moved the centre of the faithfrom Medina to Mecca. In this way the temple would lose one faith,but gain another, and although the pilgrims would now come fordifferent reasons, they would still come and keep the tills tickingover. No doubt with commercial benefits in mind, the Bedoums alsoinsisted that Mahomet tell the people to face Mecca and notJerusalem when they prayed. This would increase their desire tovisit the place they were facing several times a day. Fourteenhundred years later Moslems across the world still face the directionof Mecca when they pray.Mahomet went to war with any community throughout Arabia whowould not accept his rule and his claims to be the prophet of God.This turned a region of communities into a nation determined tospread their new creed throughout the world by whatever means werenecessary. I have to smile when I hear Moslem religious leadersspeaking on the radio, and every time they say the ‘The ProphetMohammed’ they follow immediately with ‘peace and blessings uponhim’. I am all for peace and blessings on everyone, including thosewho Mahomet and his followers murdered in the name of God andthose still kept in mental and physical bondage by Moslem fanaticstoday.

He was ruthlessin pursuit of his desire for world domination by Islam and the riversof blood flowed across the Middle East. Every country was given thesame ultimatum: accept the Caliph as their ruler and adopt theMoslem faith, or die by the sword.By the year 750, Moslem rule had advanced dramatically. It nowcontrolled Arabia, Egypt, the North African Coast, Armenia, Syria,Palestine, Persia, Mesopotamia, and Spain. This gave them control ofthe Christian ‘Mecca’ of Jerusalem and many other places theChristians believed to be sacred. In time Constantinople, the firstChristian city, would also fall. The Moslems were to adopt thecrescent as their emblem, but this was originally designed by theChristians of Constantinople and only became associated with Islamafter the city was taken. The Moslem Empire would later extend tothe Indian subcontinent where the deep and bitter hatred thus createdbetween Moslems and Hindus still continues. It is the old, old,familiar story. We have all the answers and if you don’t accept that,you are dead. One can only speculate at the mental age necessary tothink in such terms, or the power of the mental control someone orsomething has over them. When anyone tells you they have all theanswers it is time to race for the exits.You will see through the story of religions that certain key themesare common to them all. First someone channels a non-physicalcommunicator or meets the occupant of a spacecraft and takes themto be whatever version of God their belief system will accept. Afanatical zeal unfolds to impose these beliefs on everyone else andas time goes on and the original instigator dies, feuds break out overpower, money, position, and ‘truth’. So it was with the MoslemFaith. Arguments began over who should be the Caliph in thecenturies that followed. A man called Othman was chosen on oneoccasion, but this was resented by Ah, the husband of Mahomet’sdaughter, Fatima. Ah believed he should have been Caliph becausehe was a member of the Prophet’s family and Othman was not.There was tremendous conflict between the two factions and it isstill going on in some areas to this very day. The Shute, or orthodoxMoslems, believe they descend from those who said Ah should becaliph while the others, called Sunni Moslems, recognise Othman.God help us. At one time anyone who could claim to descend fromMahomet was executed and once again I’m sure the negative"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"93Brotherhood organisations were stimulating the division wheneverthey could.There were, and are, however, many good things about Moslemrule. This is an important point which I want to stress most strongly.In all these books, like the Bible and Koran, you will find among theincitements and justifications for horrific behaviour some good andvirtuous philosophies. The fanatics who, by force, have largely beenin control have picked out the former to guide their lives, but othershave had the sense and decency of spirit to be guided by the latter.Not every believer in Christianity was a murdering barbarian and norevery Moslem. Across the world today there are hundreds of millionsof faithful Christians and Moslems who follow the positive messagesin their religious books and reject the violence. There are somewonderful human beings working within the Christian Church and,as I have found in Britain and in my travels through the Middle East,you will not find a kinder, more generous people than the moderate,thinking, Moslems. If they and the moderate Christians had been incontrol over the centuries then although they would still be followingwhat are, in my view, religions based on myth, at least the slaughterfields would not have been thought necessary.There were periods in the Moslem empire when the fanatics werenot in control and these times made a vital contribution to humanityby preserving the knowledge of people like Plato and Aristotle.Under the caliph Haroun-al-Raschid in the late eighth, early ninth,century the capital was moved to Baghdad. Their thought was notimprisoned by the Koran and although the caliph still sent his armiesto pillage and murder appallingly in neighbouring lands, he also setup schools and colleges. Scientists, doctors, and philosopherstravelled to this centre of intellectual freedom. Baghdad became theworld’s wealthiest city with many hospitals, more than 600 doctorsand 6,000 students. All religions were allowed to be followed freely.When Al-Mamun took over from his father, the Greek, Persian andChaldean literature which had survived the Christian priests wastranslated into Arabic. He openly questioned the teachings of theKoran and encouraged philosophy. In this period great advances weremade in the understanding of science and healing and an extensivesystem of schools was created for children. The Moslem world waslight years ahead of Christendom where all these things, includinghealing, were banned on pain of death. In Southern Spain underMoslem rule it was the same as in Baghdad. Their way of thinking"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"94and living was in a different world to the squalor and ignorancewhich prevailed throughout Christendom. We have much to thank theMoslems, for under these more open-minded rulers, they kept theflame of knowledge alive and it paved the way for the Renaissance inEurope.The glories of Baghdad as a home of knowledge and mentalfreedom were crushed when the Turks invaded in the 11th century.These were orthodox, fanatical, Moslems and intolerance andignorance returned. I say orthodox, fanatical, Moslems, but thedivision of attitude should really be broken down into fanatics andthinkers. The Moslem fanatics had the same mentality as theChristian fanatics and had each been born in the other’s land theywould have been equally fanatical about the other’s religion. Wespeak of Moslems and Christians, but it’s not like that in reality. Itis fanatics and thinkers. The religions are simply used as a vehiclefor fanaticism. If they did not exist, they would find anotherexpression for their mental and emotional imbalances. In the sameway, if the moderate, thinking, people did not have a religionthrough which to express their spirituality, they would find anothervehicle for it.The Turks went on to create the Ottoman Empire, a name whichcame from Osman, one of their rulers. Its expansion into hithertoChristian lands was helped by the latest arguments over the trinity.Now they were falling out over the Latin word Fihoque, which means‘and from the Son’. Did the Holy Ghost proceed only from the Fatheror from the Father ‘and from the Son’? Does anyone care?Unfortunately they do, and when the Filioque was added to the creedby the Pope in 1054 it split the Western and Eastern Churches. ThisEastern Church is now known as the Greek or Eastern Orthodox.There was a definite Brotherhood ploy to now split the Christianreligion into factions of conflict. While Christendom was arguingabout all this, the Moslem Turks were taking advantage andexpanding their empire into Christian strongholds. The Pope soughtto bring unity of purpose by launching a crusade against the Moslemsto win back control of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre from the‘infidels’. There were eight crusades in all and Jerusalem was wonand then lost again. The urgency to regain the Holy City wasincreased by the belief that the Second Coming would happen soon.In fact the idea of the Saviour-god returning goes back to the days ofSun Worship and is common to many religions. Most of the crusades"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"95were a disaster and on one occasion the Church organised an armymade up of children from France and Germany in an effort to re-takeJerusalem. This ‘Children’s Crusade’ was launched during the Papacyof Innocent III. Few of the children returned. Most were victims ofdisease, accident, murder, and slavery.The Crusades were responsible for the most staggering violenceand the ‘Knights of Chivalry’ were no more than barbarous killingmachines. The European kings and knights were urged by theChurch and the Brotherhood societies to kill for God. Two branchesof the Brotherhood most active at this time were the KnightsTemplar (or Knights of the Temple) and the Knights Hospitaler. Thelatter was probably not under Brotherhood Control from its creationin 1048. It was then a charitable order, but in 1118 it had anotherincarnation as the Order of Knights Hospitaler of St John. Thiscame after a change of leadership and motivation. They became amilitary organisation named after John, the son of the King ofCyprus, who fought in the Crusades. It would seem to have been aBrotherhood take over and the Order began to operate with a GrandMaster and all the rituals, secret initiations, rituals, and symbols,which go back to ancient times. The Knights Templar were aBrotherhood branch from the start, with their Grand Master andcustomary secrecy. They came into being a year after theHospitalers joined the Brotherhood and the Templars were to haveenormous power behind the scenes. Like the Hospitalers they weregiven large amounts of money by supporters of the Crusades andthe Templars became so rich they began the financial centres inParis and London by storing their wealth in their temples in thosecities. The Teutonic (German) Knights were another charitableorder who changed to a military role. They had a Grand Master andall the trimmings and these three Brotherhood branches hated eachother, much to the delight of those who were controlling themwithout their knowledge. Again I am not saying that every memberof these groups was knowingly working against the people. Mostwould have had the best of intentions. The Brotherhood doesn’twork like that. It needs to hoodwink most of its own to be mosteffective. The Brotherhood is manipulation with a smile on its faceand it seeks a good public image. For that it needs some goodpeople involved at the lower levels. Charitable trusts and charitywork in general is often a front it chooses to use.Even on the journeys to the ‘Holy Land’ by the Christian Crusaders"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"96other non-believers on route were tortured and murdered. The Jewssuffered most. The Christians condemned the whole Jewish Race asthe ‘murderers of Christ’ and any scale of barbarity against themcould be justified by that. When the crusaders of the Lord re-tookJerusalem one of their first acts was to burn the synagogue with theJews still inside. The streets literally ran with the blood of theirJewish and Moslem victims, a great contrast to the way someMoslem leaders treated the Christians when Islam regained the city.In the end the crusades achieved nothing, except for sendinghundreds of thousands to an early grave and causing terrible pain anddestruction - exactly what the Brotherhood wanted. It was not untilthis century that the Christian world had control of the Holy Landagain, when it became part of the British Empire. The Jews sufferedin Europe for another reason. The Christian religion in this periodimposed a strict ban on usury, the charging of interest on loans. Anusurer could have all his property confiscated, be excommunicated,and refused a Christian burial. It was considered better that a wifeshould leave an usurer husband and beg for food, than to acceptanything from him. The Jews were not subject to this Christian lawand they did change interest on lending. This made them extremelyunpopular with people in debt. In 1290, 16,000 Jews were deportedfrom England because of this.At the end of the Crusades and the Moslem victory, theBrotherhood knights had to flee. The Order of St John did well, as itmoved around, changing its name with its location as the Knights ofRhodes and Knights of Malta. They have survived to this day as theSovereign and Military Order of Malta, which, with papal help,moved its base to Rome and became the world’s smallest nation. TheKnights of Malta have tremendous influence in politics and in thesecret societies today. The Templars have also survived, but thereprisals against them for losing the crusades, and the charges aimedagainst them for spitting on the cross and homosexuality saw theirwealth and power taken away. (For a while, anyway).The reasons for this campaign against them were greed and thepreservation of the con-trick called Christianity. The Templarsaccumulated breathtaking riches as Christians gave their wealth tothem in their wills and donations. The Templars were the richestorganisation in every country in which they established themselves.They became bankers without charging interest because theChristian Church had a ban on usury. When the Jews were expelled"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"97from France in 1306 for their usury activities, Philip, the FrenchKing, had to re-pay his debts to them. This he did by giving themvirtually all his country’s reserves of coinage in exchange for all theproperty they left behind. This was similar to the deal struckbetween the Jews and King William (Rufus) when they werethrown out of England for charging interest on loans. King Philipwas desperate for money to meet foreign commitments and hedecided to steal the Templar gold. Philip and his fellow Frenchman,Pope Clement V, hatched a plan to achieve it. Allegations weremade against the Templars and Clement charged them with heresy.Their money went to Philip and their lands to the church. TheTemplar’s Grand Master, Jacques de Moley, was burned at thestake.But there was another reason why the Roman Catholic Churchwas so keen on destroying the Templars and the Cathars. In 1891during restoration of the village church at Rennes4e-Chateau inSouth-West France, the parish priest, Berenger Sauniere, found fourparchments. They were sealed in wooden tubes which had beenhidden inside a hollow altar pillar. Two of these contained the bloodlines of local families and dated back to 1244 and 1644. Saunierealso discovered a secret code in the texts and he told the Bishop ofCarcassonne what he had found. With that the parish priest wassummoned to Paris to meet the church hierarchy and show them theparchments.From that time, Sauniere was a man transformed. He would haveearned a very small income as a priest, but in the years thatfollowed he spent millions on paintings, antiques and rare china. Healso built a mansion which he never lived in and a tower so close tothe side of a mountain that it overlooked nothing. His behaviourbecame very strange in all sorts of ways. When a new Bishop ofCarcassonne was appointed and complained at Saunie re’s antics,the parish priest was supported by the Pope himself Sauniere diedof ‘a stroke’ in 1917 at the age of sixty-five. But it seems that hiscoffin had been ordered by his housekeeper five days before his‘stroke’, when he had seemed perfectly healthy. A priest who cameto give him the last rites and heard his confession was said to haveleft the room visibly shaken and never to have smiled again.So what did Sauniere know?In 1969, Henry Lincoln, a British scriptwriter, became interested inthe story and he uncovered documents at the National Library in"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"98France kept under the title of ‘Dossiers Secrets’. One mentioned asecret order structured on typical Brotherhood lines called thePriory of Sion which had also been named in the parchments foundby Saumere in Rennes4e-Chateau. Lincoln’s document said that pastGrand Masters of this order included Leonardo da Vinci, thescientist Isaac Newton, the alchemist, Nicholas Flamel, and thecomposer, Claude Debussy. The plot thickened because Saumerehad met Debussy when he was summoned to Paris by the RomanCatholic hierarchy. The Priory of Sion, the document went on, wasthe inner hierarchy of the Knights Templar which were dedicated torestoring the Merovingians to the French Throne. The Merovingiandynasty began in the 5th century. Merovee became Frankish King in448 and the family were said to have royal or holy blood. TheTemplars had a stronghold at Bezu not far from Rennes4e-Chateau,and remember, the parchments found by Saumere included familyblood lines.This becomes extremely relevant and links in perfectly with myearlier conclusions about the Jesus story when you consider thefollowing. Henry Lincoln’s work was the subject of three televisiondocumentaries in 1972 and as a result he received a letter from aretired Anglican priest. The letter said that the writer knew forcertain that what Saumere found was uncontestable proof that Jesusdid not die on the cross. The priest said that he was given thisinformation by a fellow Anglican cleric who had worked in Pariswith Emile Hoffet. When Sauniere was ordered to Paris, one ofthose who interviewed him was Emile Hoffet. Lincoln’s informantsaid the parchments proved that Jesus was alive in France at leastuntil 45AD. As I suggested earlier, Jesus travelled to the Rennes-leChateau area with Mary Magdalene and their children after he hadrecovered from the crucifixion. He may have died there or p05siblyhe could have ended his life in Kashmir, as I mentioned earlier. Ibelieve the Roman Catholic Church know that Jesus did not die onthe cross and have done so for at least 1500 years. They havesuppressed this knowledge to protect their own power. They haveconned billions of people over the centuries and continue to do sotoday. The proof of this is locked up in the Vatican vaults and, asSauniere found out, they will pay any sort of price to persist withthis monumental lie.They will also commit genocide to preserve their deceit. KingPhilip may have had money as his motivation to destroy the Knights"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"99Templar after the failed Crusades, but Pope Clement V had otherreasons for his own involvement. The Templars knew the true storyof Jesus, just as the Cathars had done when they emerged in the sameregion of France which includes Rennes-leChateau. The Cathars hadalso denied that Jesus died on the cross and they were eliminated forthat reason more than any other. I feel the much talked-about Cathar‘treasure’ was the proof that Jesus survived the cross. This story goeson to this day because the Brotherhood elite is still determined tocrown a ‘World King’ who descends from the bloodline ofJesus,something they inherited via the Templars, who believed that theMerovingians decended from the blood line of King David, throughJesus and his children. This is why they were so keen to put theMerovingians back on the French throne, and this was anotherincentive for King Philip to be rid of them. It was thought theMerovingian blood line had died out after they lost the Frankishthrone in the 8th century, but the Cathars and the Templars knewdifferently. Today, somewhere in the world, the Brotherhood, or someelements of it, are possibly preparing a person who they claim to befrom the David, Jesus, Merovingian, blood line to become ‘WorldKing’.Everything and everyone is expendable to those who control theBrotherhood once their use to them has run its course. There is nobetter example of that than the way the Brotherhood wasmanipulating its Christian branches to fight the Moslems, whiledoing the same to its Moslem branches to fight the Christians.Among these Moslem Brotherhood groups were the Karmathites,the Druses, the Brotherhood of the Nine, and the Assassins. At theheart of the secret societies of the Moslem world was the GrandLodge of Cairo from where many Brotherhood groups in Europeoriginated. As with all religions the original structure breaks up intofactions, as with the Shutes. Out of the Shutes came another factioncalled the Ismaili Sect, a Brotherhood Branch with the Aga Khan asits ‘spiritual leader’ today, and out of that came yet another arm ofthe Brotherhood, the Assassins - Grand Master, secret initiations, youknow the score. The word Assassin means a user of hashish becausethey used the drug to stimulate their mystical experiences and forother more sinister reasons. Now assassin means something verydifferent - a lone killer. This is because the Assassins used thismethod very effectively to expand their power from their base inIran. They were not choosy. They killed Moslem and Christian alike."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"100The Assassins became a model for the political and economicmurders of today. They would not do the killing themselves, theywould mind control a young man and get him to do it. Their preferredmethod was to introduce him to the Grand Master. He would then bedrugged with hashish and lose consciousness. When he awoke hewould be in a beautiful garden and there he would be pampered andled to believe he was in heaven, paradise. He would be given more ofthe drug, lose consciousness again, and wake up back with the GrandMaster. The killer-to-be would be told that he had never left theGrand Master’s presence and that he had been given a taste of theeternal paradise that would await him if he did as he was told by theAssassins and killed for God. They invariably did. Could somethingalong these lines have happened to Mahomet centuries earlier?This same basic technique, but now far more sophisticated, is usedtoday to murder those who get in the way of the Brotherhood’s planfor world domination. This method of mind controlling outsiders todo your dirty work makes it almost impossible to identify the realkillers, especially when those investigating the crime are alsoBrotherhood members, more often than not. The Moslem secretsocieties indoctrinated and conned their initiates in ways that alsomirrored the other branches of the Brotherhood, like the freemasons.The lower degrees of initiation were quite straightforward andappeared to support the status quo, the Moslem religion in theircase. But then, at a certain level when the initiate was wellentrenched in the society, the whole story was switched andsuddenly they were told to forget all they had been told before. Thenew version of the ‘truth’, which itself would undergo other changesat the higher levels of initiation, would lead to the revelation of whoor what the society was really serving. Only if it was believedbeyond doubt that you could be trusted to support the ‘Great Work’would you be given this knowledge. This is how the few can use themajority of their members as a front of respectability for theirclandestine activities against freedom. If you are a freemason or amember of any secret society, you are almost certainly beingconned, and it is time you realised that. Get out while you can.

As we have seen, nothing could be further from the truth. Itsought to crush all efforts to bring civilisation to the Dark Ages it hadcreated.Part of its propaganda is to lump all pre-Christians together as‘pagans’ and therefore heathens and savages. This is another abuse oftruth. Yes, there were people in the pre-Christian world who behavedin terrible ways, but none was any worse than those who imposedChristianity. And to say that all pre-Christians were ‘heathens’ issupreme arrogance. Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Pythagoras,Hippocrates, Quintilion, were heathens? The very thought ishysterical.You simply cannot divide generations and civilisations into heathenand enlightened, or good and bad. Within all civilisations, no matterhow negative their overall effect, are positive people trying to dowhat their heart is telling them. During the worst excesses ofChristianity there were many compassionate people who followed thecreed, and it was the same with Islam and other religions. So it hasbeen throughout human history. We look back on those who peopledthe Earth in the thousands of years before Christianity and believethem to be stupid savages; yet the understanding of life and creationamong many of their number was more advanced than the modernworld in many ways.Their most enlightened members, often incarnations of thevolunteer consciousness supported by channelled information, knewthat the Earth was alive with a mind of her own. They knew of theenergy system and the sacred points. The ancient Chinese appliedthis knowledge to the human body in what has become known asacupuncture.

Many ofthem have an effect similar to acupuncture needles. These greatstructures, like Stonehenge in England, are said to be the cultishmonuments of a backward people, and yet what they put into place isstill at work today helping to keep the battered energy grid in somekind of order. They were excellent channellers because they were notsubjected to the tidal wave of abuse, derision, and condemnationfrom their society when their psychic gifts were activated as children.Their parents did not say ‘Don’t be silly’, when they saw visions ofentities on other frequencies or heard their communications; so theydid not shut down these channels through fear and confusion.Naturally they were subjected to manipulation and I’m sure that someof the standing stones and circles were put there for negative reasons,too, to disrupt the energy flows or even to concentrate the energies atcertain points to allow the spacecraft to use the power for theiractivities. Not every stone circle is positive, but overall these ancientpeoples had some idea of the Earth as a living, breathing, entity.I feel that the land we now call the British Isles was part of Atlantisbefore the series of cataclysms began to disconnect this land from theisland that Atlantis was to become. Britain has always been recognisedas an area of enormous importance to the grid. Despite the efforts ofpeople like Boadicea, the Britons could not hold out against theRoman invasion. Although Julius Caesar’s attempted invasion waseventually repelled, the Roman Empire absorbed most of Britain a fewyears later after the year 43. They never did succeed in suppressingmost of the people of Scotland and a wall would be built by theEmperor Hadrian to keep them out. Christianity would later do whatthe Romans could not do take control of all Scotland. The rule of theRomans had many benefits.The inter-tribal wars diminished and roads were built to improvecommunications.After the fall of the Roman Empire in 410 the islands of Britain wereinvaded by tribes from the regions we know as Germany and Denmark.The inter-breeding of the indigenous population and the invaderscreated the Anglo-Saxon race. It was in these Anglo-Saxon times thatthe process of losing the ancient knowledge really began to accelerate.The country was broken up into the kingdoms of Northumbria, Mercia,Wessex, East Anglia, Essex, Kent and Sussex. They fought over yes,you’ve got it religion. The supporters of the Nicene Creed fought withthose who supported the Anus view of Jesus, while the pagans fought"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"104with both both of them. Oswy, the Christian king of Northumbria,‘did a Constantine’ in 664, when he called the two Christian factionstogether at Whitby; after hearing the arguments he decided that allEngland would follow the Pope and the Nicene Creed. Thefoundations were now set for the Church to rule the country. The ruleof the Roman emperor had been replaced by the rule of the Romanpope, so it was throughout the former Roman Empire. Now themanipulators only had to control the papacy as they controlled mostof the known world.As the very mention of the socalled pagan knowledge became theequivalent of suicide in the Christian world, the information aboutenergies and energy sites was passed on in legends by those whowished to preserve the basic truths. They talked in codes about giantsand sacred hills and wells, and the ‘giants’ could even have someextra-terrestrial background, too. These stories can still be found inlocal folklore today, and because they are taken literally theoriginators are looked upon as backward people. When you decodethe symbolism you can see that they were far from backward. Theywere merely trying to pass on knowledge in ways that would not getthem executed by those who were backward - the representatives ofthe Christian religion.There was conflict all over Europe, with village fighting village atany excuse, and the culture brought by the Romans was largelydestroyed. The chaos throughout the former Roman Empiredeveloped into a form of control called feudalism, which was tocreate the social structure on which Europe developed for centuriesto come. Groups of weaker people would gathered behind a strongpersonality (not necessarily an enlightened one by any means), andall who followed him and did whatever he asked were given hisprotection. The division had arrived between the freeman and thebondsman, those who were no more than slaves. The leaders wouldbecome known as the lord or the king and they were considered to bethe representatives of God. The noblemen were the upper classes.Christianity was one of the main instigators and supporters of thissystem which turned most people into the slaves of the few and itwas the. same across Europe. The kings and noblemen took over theland, and they gave great wealth to the Church in their misguidedbelief, encouraged by the Church, that they were buying a place inheaven. The feudal manor or the monastery was now the authoritywhich the communities of serfs had to obey. In time Britain was"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"105divided into shires ruled by ealdormen (later known as earls), andunder them were the thegns (later barons). These, along with themost powerful priests, became the nobility. It is from thesebeginnings and the creation of slaves that the class system emergedwhich is still with us today, with its landed gentry, nobility, Churchand clergy, separated from the mass of the people by either wealth orprivilege, often both.All this was dreamland for the negative Brotherhood sects. What aperfect system to manipulate, playing one against the other to createconflict and upheaval, using this to change the world in your image.These kingdoms and communities would fight and battle with eachother until one or a few would become dominant and take over largeareas of land which would develop into a country. Wessex becamedominant in England when it defeated the Mercians in 825 and KingEgbert of Wessex controlled all of England. He was, in effect if notname, the first English king. Ethelwulf followed, and then cameAlfred the Great. He was by far the most enlightened ruler of his timeencouraging, among other things, the translation of Latin literatureinto English. Through it all the Church prospered. Kingdoms andnobles may come and go, but the Church was always there, addingwith every dying king and noble to its now breathtaking fortune ofland and riches. Christianity was now in control of England, and sowas the Brotherhood.This control would strengthen even further after the Battle ofHastings in 1066. Harold, the English King, was faced with invasionsfrom the Danes and the Normans. He defeated the Danes at the Battleof Stamford Bridge near York and marched his troops south to tackleWilliam, Duke of Normandy, a ruthless man who was very close toPope Alexander II. The Pope, William, and brotherhood societiesplotted the invasion of England and the Papacy supplied the funds.William believed he was doing it for God and he carried the Pope’sbanners into battle, just as the pagan armies had carried images oftheir gods into the fray. Nothing had changed except the emblem.William defeated the English army and became king. Now the Popewould have a subservient England along with France and Germany.French became the language of England and this gradually fusedwith the various other languages spoken on the islands, Celtic,Anglo-Saxon, Latin, and Danish, to create the English tongue werecognise today.William ordered the production of the Doomsday Book which"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"106recorded the ownership of every house, animal, and acre of land fortaxation purposes and he gave great areas of England to the Churchto pay back the Pope for his support of the invasion. Lanfranc, anItalian Prior, was brought over from his abbey in Normandy to bemade Archbishop of Canterbury and administer the Church’s landand other wealth. It was he who organised a system of tithes to bepaid to the Church by every landowner in the country. Even thepoorest were not exempt and they paid up in their ignorance and fearthat the priests could consign them to hell forever more. To this daythe landowners of England still have to pay this tithe to the Church,even if they think that Christianity is a load of baloney. Opposition inthe 1930s would change the nature of the payment, but it is still paidin another way. In 1936 the tithes were replaced by a fixed annualpayment to be charged until October 1996. These fees are to pay forthe three per cent of Government stock handed over to the Churchauthorities in exchange for them conceding their right to the tithes.This means, of course, that we are all paying for the Church in thecosts added by the landowners to the price of their produce. All thisbecause the priests frightened people through violence or hell anddamnation into handing over their lands during a period of nearly athousand years.Through all this period of English and world history and in thefollowing centuries, enlightened and courageous people were tryingto raise the level of consciousness and knowledge. It is difficult topick out which of them were genuinely seeking freedom for thepeople and which were working to a Brotherhood agenda,undermining religion in the longer term to bring about a world thataccepted only the physical level of being. I think at least the greatmajority had good intent, and if they were playing the Brotherhood’sgame, it was probably mostly by ignorance, not malice. Roger Bacon,an English Franciscan friar of the 13th century wrote that peopleshould cease to be ruled by dogma and authority and think forthemselves. He had an advanced understanding for his time ofscience and he was confined by the Church because of his views.Others followed and their numbers grew until it exploded into theperiod called the Renaissance or ‘new birth’. The key to whatfollowed was the coming of the printing press to Europe. The meansto make paper had been discovered by the Chinese, taken on by theMoslems and, though them, reached the Italians. The idea of printingwith movable type also goes back to China and in the 1470s William"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"107Caxton was setting up his printing press in Westminster andproducing the first book by this method in England. Caxtontranslated books from French and Latin into English and theexchange of knowledge began to flow all over Europe, although theChurch would seek to suppress this at every turn.The Renaissance in art, literature, and knowledge began chiefly inItaly from its stronghold in Florence. Greeks were seeking refuge inItaly from the Turks and they brought with them their knowledge,language and books. The learning of the Greek language had beenbanned by the Roman Catholic Church to stop people reading theworks of the Greek philosophers, but now the ban was being ignoredby those thirsting for knowledge. The spread of Greek literaturereached England, France, and Germany. When the Turks tookConstantinople there was an exodus of Greeks to Italy with yet morebooks, manuscripts, and knowledge. The works of the Moslemscientists and the knowledge gathered at the time of the open-mindedrulers in Baghdad found its way to Italy and Europe.The volunteer consciousness and the other levels were doing allthey could to bring about the breakthrough in knowledge that wouldundermine the power of the Church. Vittorino da Feltre pioneered anew educational system in Italy which offered his students all theknowledge available, not only that which the Church wished toimpose. The obvious corruption, vice, and violence of the Churchwas reducing its authority and then came the Great Schism whenthere were two popes, one ruling from Rome and the other fromAvignon. This came about because the Italian Church believed thatonly an Italian should be pope and for thirty-eight years there weretwo popes, each with their own army plundering and pillagingwherever they went.The discovery of America reduced Italy’s importance as a tradingcentre and places like Venice and Genoa diminished in their wealthand power. The poverty this brought to Italy dimmed the fires ofchange and slowly the Church reimposed its grip, especially afterChristian Spain occupied Northern Italy in 1538. The Churchcompiled an index on all banned literature which comprised, ofcourse, of everything that challenged its doctrines. The Inquisitionincreased its work rate. But much as the Roman Church tried toclose the door again on knowledge, changes were now inevitable.There had been growing discontent with the ex cesses of the papacyand the priests. he papacy went to the highest bidder. The post gave"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"108the occupant control of incredible wealth and real estate. Kingsbowed to the power of Rome and the inquisition secured thesubmission of the masses. The Church also supported the feudalsystem of masters and serfs. The reaction against all this had beena long time coming. The pressure for change had gathered slowly,and then more quickly through these centuries of fear andsubservience. The bubonic plague called the Black Death wasdramatically to reduce the population of the world, and in Europealone about a quarter of the population died. I have seen itspeculated that the Black Death and other plagues might have beencreated by a version of extra-terrestrial germ warfare. Certainly itwould seem that bright lights in the sky and foul smelling mistswere reported quite often before the plague struck a community.Reports of ‘comets’ at that time could easily have been spacecraft,and historians have written of comets trailing behind them gasesthat killed trees and the lands fertility. We now often symbolisedeath with a picture of a skeleton holding a scythe; this comes fromthe numerous reports across Europe of strange men in blackholding ‘scythes’ who appeared in a town or village before peoplefell ill with the black death. What were these ‘scythes’? Whateverthe cause of the plague, it did have a long term impact in changingthe status quo.There were now fewer people to do the work of their masters andtheir dependence on the serfs that were available increased. Thesupply and demand of labour had tilted towards the serfs and thedowntrodden began to protest against their conditions. Sometimestheir leaders were assassinated, but the protests continued and therewere peasant revolts in many countries, which brought conflict,upheaval, pain and suffering. The centuries of blind and massobedience to the Church and its masters were being questionedduring this period from the 14th to 17th centuries. Events and thegrowth of knowledge was beginning the process ofliberation fromChurch control, a process that is only reaching fruition today in whatyou might call the Spiritual Renaissance or the Light Age.The Church was an obvious target for change and courageouspeople stood up and challenged it. John Wycliffe condemned thebehaviour of the priests who were using information gathered atconfessions to blackmail people; some priests were sellingforgiveness of sin for money or possessions. Wycliffe advocated thatthe scriptures were the only foundation of religious knowledge and"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"109that the pope was not the head of the Church. He dismissed the ideaof transubstantiation - the belief that bread and wine can beconverted into the body and blood of Christ during the Eucharistceremony. He had the Bible translated into English and sent outsupporters to expound his views. The priests would later persuadeHenry IV to authorise the burning of all heretics, including Wycliffe’ssupporters. By then he had died, but the priests had his bonesexhumed from a churchyard in Lutterworth, Leicestershire, where hehad been had been parish priest. They did not want his skeletonpolluting holy ground. The more Rome sought to deal violently withprotesters, the more protests they had to deal with.The coming of the printing press brought the translation anddistribution of the Bible to a much wider audience. Up until then, themasses had only the word of the priests to tell them what the Biblesaid and meant. But as it was made more widely available peoplebegan to see the difference between the simple lives of the Bible‘heroes’ and the opulent lifestyles of the clergy who were taking tenper cent of all the wealth the people produced. They could begin tore-interpret the texts for themselves. The Church knew theconsequences of this and among their desperate efforts to suppressknowledge of the Bible’s true content was to murder by burning atthe stake, William Tyndale. His heresy had been to begin to translatethe New Testament into English. When people did have theopportunity to read the Bible there was a desire for a return to thesimplicity of the Scriptures and the Protestant movement began. Thisbrought about the Reformation when the Protestants broke awayfrom the Catholic Church.Martin Luther was one of the early Protestant leaders. He lived inGermany, which was then composed of over three hundred states. In1517, this professor of theology at Wittenberg University pinned up apiece of paper containing ninety-five complaints against thebehaviour of Rome, in its efforts to raise money to build the churchof St Peter’s, on what had been the site of a pagan temple. The newchurch was, itself, built to make money in much the same way as thebedoums of Mecca fleeced the pilgrims. This attitude continues in theVatican City today.Pope Julius II and his successor Leo X sanctioned a plan to selldivine pardons for money. For each donation they promised torelease from purgatory the soul of a dead relative or friend.

The Lutheran Church was born and many of thepeasants supported Luther in the hope that religious change wouldbring social reform. They backed the wrong man, for he was as mucha tyrant as most of the popes and he would later support terribleatrocities against the peasant peoples who wanted only freedom fromtyranny. As he once wrote:“Damned be love into the abyss of hell, if it is maintained to thedamage of faith.....It is better that tyrants should sin a hundred timesagainst the people than the people should sin once against thetyrants....the ass wants to be thrashed, the mob to be governed by force.”His hatred of reason and opened minded research was equallyextreme. In one sermon he said that his followers should throw spit inthe face of reason, because she was the Devil’s whore, rotten with theitch of leprosy, and ought to be kept in the toilet. Nice man. He mayhave complained about papal and clerical indulgences, but like theother Protestants, he still believed the nonsense which Jerome andothers had edited into the Bible and all the other inaccuracies thathad been in the texts to start with. Other forms of Protestantinterpretation of the Bible followed such as Calvinism, the product ofthe Frenchmen John Calvin. He was as much a dictator as Luther andthe Popes. Religion - and the Brotherhood -seem to breed suchpeople. Calvin’s obnoxious creed was to have severe consequences inEngland and America because it was a major influence on the beliefsof the Puritans, of which more later. Calvin promoted the idea, likeLuther, that you could not ensure eternal salvation by the way youlived your life or by ‘good works’. It could only come by faith inJesus as your saviour. Even the Roman Catholic Church wasn’t quitethat extreme, but Calvin went even further. He said that whether wewere to be ‘saved’ or not was decided by God before we were born!He called this idea predestination. The chosen few who were selectedby God for eternal salvation had a duty, he said, to suppress the sin of"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"111the condemned masses. It was, in other words, a licence for untoldslaughter.Protestantism broke into endless creeds, sects, and churches withdifferent beliefs arguing on the vital issues for the future of humankind like the nature of the Trinity and whether Jesus entered thebread and wine consumed during the Eucharist. This comes from aquote attributed to Jesus in the Bible which was, in fact, an additionby one of the many forgers and relates to a pagan belief:“And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, andbrake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, ‘Take, eat, this is mybody’. And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them,saying, ‘Drink ye all of it. For this is my blood of the new testament,which is shed for many for the remission of sins’.”Over the interpretation of this forgery whole wars were fought. TheProtestant Movement came to England in a rather unusual way.Henry VIII wanted a son and heir, but his first wife Catherine ofAragon could only bear him a daughter, Mary. He decided to divorceher and asked Pope Clement VII to sanction it. He refused. Henrywas a committed Catholic and had condemned the Protestants inEurope to such an extent that the Pope had awarded him the titleDefender of the Faith which British monarchs still hold to this day.This is ironic, because today they are Protestant monarchs defendingthat faith under a title given by a Roman Catholic pope for defendinghis faith! You’ve got to chuckle, really. Henry was such a defender ofthe Catholic faith he ordered that all who denied it were to be burnedat the stake. But the opposition to his divorce changed all that. Heinsisted that his parliament vote into being a Church of Englandindependent of Rome, and he made himself the head of the EnglishChurch. When that was done the Archbishop of Canterbury, ThomasCranmer, sanctioned his divorce from Catherine. Cranmer replacedCardinal Wolsey as England’s most influential churchman, becauseWolsey had failed to secure his divorce. He was summoned toLondon to be tried for treason, but died on the way at LeicesterAbbey.Wolsey had ruled the English Church like a dictator and had, to alarge extent, run the country. The monasteries had enormous powerand were home to the papal garrison. They also owned great areas ofEngland. They used the tried and trusted methods like the fear of hell"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"112to persuade the wealthy to leave them their land and possessions.When that didn’t work they found some excuse to take them. In theirearly days, the monasteries had made a positive contribution whencompared with the murder and misery in other areas of Christendom,but now they were just as bad. Henry had long coveted their wealthand he took his opportunity to abolish them and take theirpossessions. He was so short of money that he had to sell much of theland he acquired and this was the start of the period of the countrysquire and gentry. These were the wealthy men who bought themassive estates once owned, or rather stolen, by the Church, and theybuilt upon them their manor houses that have become such a part ofthe English countryside.Henry waged war on anyone who refused to accept him asSupreme Head of the Church, as outlined in the Act of Supremacy of1534. His Cardinal, Sir Thomas More, was beheaded for suchtreason and there was a bloody purge on Roman Catholics. Henrymarried six women, two of which he executed. Only Jane Seymourbore him a son, who’ became Edward VI at the age of only ninewhen Henry died in 1547. Edward was king in name only with theProtestant Duke of Somerset the real power behind the throne.Edward himself died at 15 and he was succeeded by Mary, Henry’sdaughter by Catherine of Aragon. She was a staunch Roman Catholicand she began a bloody purge against Protestants which was sosavage she was given the name ‘Bloody Mary’. Edward had beenpersuaded by the Duke of Somerset to leave the throne to Henry’sgreat grand-daughter, Lady Jane Grey, who was a Protestantsupporter, but Mary had her executed and took the throne. Marymarried Philip of Spain who wished to have a peaceful relationshipwith England, so that his ships could pass along the English Channelwithout hindrance. The Pope again became head of the Church ofEngland. But another about-turn was imminent. With Mary’s deathcame Elizabeth I, the daughter of Anne Boleyn, and she becamequeen at the age of 25. Her mother had been a Protestant and sheaccepted that faith.

She ignored them and restored the Protestant Church ofEngland with herself as its Supreme Head. A bloody purge waslaunched against Catholics. The Queen ordered the torture and deathof so many Irish Catholics they gave her the title ‘Bloody Elizabeth’."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"113All over Europe mass slaughter was being unleashed as Catholicsand Protestants fought against each other in civil and national wars.Which side was most persecuted depended on who had managed toseize the throne at the time. When you look back at the scale of deathand destruction committed in the name of religion, even basically thesame religion, it is stunning beyond belief. All but a handful of warshave been caused by religion or the perceived superiority of theancestral line of one group or nation’s physical b6dies, when in truththey are just temporary vehicles for our consciousness to experiencethis level. But let us take another angle on the events that followedthe Reformation. I mentioned earlier that the Brotherhood had a longterm aim of using religion for its own ends and then moving on to thenext stage, to replace religion, which largely abused the knowledgeof the spirit, with a godless science which convinced the mass of thepeople that the spirit did not even exist. Part of this plan was todismantle the power of the Roman Catholic Church and create morefactions within the Christian religion. Even if they did not actuallystart the Reformation - and I believe they did - they certainly tookadvantage of it.The real roots of the Reformation were in Germany in the 14thcentury when an arm of the Brotherhood emerged called theIlluminati, Latin for the Illuminated or Enlightened Ones. Theywere closely connected to the Rosicrucians (Latin for the rose andthe cross), which began centuries earlier and was introduced toGermany by the Emperor Charlemagne in the ninth century. At onetime at least you would be accepted into the Illuminati when youhad reached a certain level of initiation in the Rosicrucians. Bothwere classic secret societies in the manner I have outlined, and theybegan covertly to introduce a number of religious movementsaround Europe. One was called the Friends of God led by RulmanMerswin, a rich banker, who was conned by the Brotherhood intobelieving he had been chosen by God to preach his message becausethe Pope could no longer be trusted to it. What’s more God wouldsoon punish humanity for its sin, he was told. The End Of TheWorld and the Day of Judgment is another Brotherhood theme. TheFriends of God was a mind control cult that accepted only totalobedience from its followers. It gained many supporters who werefed up with the corruption in the Roman Catholic Church, andeventually Merswin had a ‘revelation’ that he should hand over hisreligion lock, stock, and barrel to another branch of the Brotherhood,"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"114probably linked to freemasonry, called the Order of St John.Martin Luther was strongly influenced by some of these Germanmystical societies and he was especially keen on the writings of theGerman mystic, Johann Tauler, a man closely connected with theFriends of God. It seems certain, also, that Luther was a Rosicrucian,given that his personal seal contains both of their symbols, the roseand the cross. He was close to many members of the Illuminati andthe Rosicrucians, and they would have been using him, with orwithout his knowledge, to break the overwhelming power of theRoman Catholic Church. The Vatican was, itself, a Brotherhood tool,but none is allowed to get too powerful, and all are expendable whenthe time is right. These two Christian creeds of Protestant andCatholic were now to be used, as we have already seen, to stimulateenormous conflict. But it is important to emphasise that theBrotherhood was not in total control of all events. I am sure theyhave had some monumental failures in their time, as people have notreacted in the way they expected, or some of their number did not doas they were told once they realised what the game plan was. I haveno doubt that some of their wars have not had the outcome theyalways hoped for. I feel, too, that there have been many periods whenthe volunteer consciousness has infiltrated these movements and triedto undermine and change them from within and I believe that behindthe scenes this was happening during the time of Sir Francis Baconwho became the highest executive of the Rosicrucian Order inEngland. It was during his lifetime in the early 1 600s that theteachings of the order began to include some references to the needfor personal spiritual salvation by taking control of our own thinkingand actions, and some of these are still reflected in that order. Thefact that someone in history was a member of a secret society tells usnothing. It is the agenda they were working to that matters, and itwasn’t always negative; far from it. What I am sure about, however,is that from the Reformation onwards, the Brotherhood takeover bythe Luciferic consciousness was virtually complete, and its power tomanipulate events was seen to reach new heights.Elizabeth I secured the long term future of the Episcopalian Churchof England, better known as the Anglican Faith. Anyone who didn’tattend local Church services was fined orjailed.

It is an outrage. If it wasn’t so tragic it would make acomedy series.Elizabeth ensured that the Protestant Faith would survive when hernavy defeated the Spanish Armada in 1588. One of the commandersof the English Navy was Francis Drake, a former pirate turnedadmiral, who was the second man to circumnavigate the world. PhilipII of Spain had been urged by Pope Pius V to invade England, kill the‘bastard’ Queen, and restore the rule of Catholicism. Pius V was theman who was burning, hanging and beheading the religiousreformers in Italy. Philip was further motivated in his duty by theterrible atrocities committed against the Catholics of England andIreland. He believed that such atrocities should only be committedagainst Protestants. But his Armada was defeated in the EnglishChannel and the power of Rome and Spain was dimmed. Thefoothold the Protestant Faith had won in Europe was secured. If theSpanish had conquered England the whole Protestant movementmight have collapsed. When Elizabeth died in 1603, England andScotland united under one monarch. They had been in conflict overthousands of years, but now James Vi of Scotland became James I ofEngland, too. The Kingdom was united - on paper at least.The 16th and 17th centuries in England during the reign of Elizabethand later was a time of great ‘volunteer’ activity as they sought to raisehuman understanding through art and scientific research. Sir FrancisBacon worked within the secret societies and I have no doubt he wrotethe ‘Shakespeare’ plays and included in them esoteric codes. Anthony,the brother of Francis, ran a ‘spy network’ which was a front forpassing on esoteric knowledge. I feel that at this time there was a secretsociety operating within a secret society and that when in the end theBrotherhood realised what was going on the Bacons and others werestopped by a campaign of covert killings and trumped up charges thatsaw Francis sent to jail.

He was todevelop the use of the telescope to study the skies and his researchled him to the conclusion that, contrary to what the Church said, theSun did not circle the Earth - it was the other way round. Nor did hebelieve the Earth was the centre of the Universe. This confirmed thefindings of Nicolaus Copernicus, a Polish scientist who had died in1543. Copernicus had continued the work begun nearly 2,000 yearsearlier by Pythagoras and others. Copernicus had been pilloried bythe Church for his ‘heresy’ and his work suppressed. Almost acentury later the same was to happen to Galileo. It could well be thathe was a reincarnation of Copernicus. Galileo was tried for heresy in1632 by the Inquisition for writing a book supporting the Copernicustheory. A document was falsified by the Church to back up the caseagainst him. He was found guilty of ‘holding and teaching theCopernicus doctrine’ (i.e. saying the Earth goes around the Sun and isnot the centre of the Universe). Galileo escaped the most extrememethods of the Inquisition, but he was placed under house arrest forthe last eight years of his life. You can see how dogmatic religion hasheld back human evolution and understanding. It was only in thisdecade that the Roman Catholic Church officially admitted thatGalileo was right!! It is interesting to note that some of his fiercestcritics were other academics and scientists who realised theconsequences of his findings for their power and influence. The sameattitude is still prevalent today.During this period there were many seers and prophets whopredicted the future in terms very similar in themes to those beingpresented today. Nostradamus, who lived in Southern France, is themost famous of them. I feel he was predicting what would happen ifhumanity continued on the path it had embarked upon. By tuningyour consciousness to those vibrations of thought energy that retainCreation’s eternal memory, you can ‘see’ the past with your psychicvision or channel information about it. You can experience somethingof a past life or see a past event. In the same way you can ‘see’ thefuture. I believe that consciousness is constantly projecting forwardhow things will be on the basis of what has happened (the past) andwhat is happening (the present). From these sources, the collectiveconsciousness projects forward what will happen if those same trendscontinue. So the future exists as the past exists in thought energy that"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"118is outside of our version and understanding of space and time. Whenpeople tune to that vibration, they are accessing information aboutthe projected future, not necessarily the future as it will be. I believethis was the information that Nostradamus was tuning to for hisfamous predictions and he was also accessing knowledge of the planfor the transformation of human consciousness in the time we areliving in now as we progress into the Photon Beam. Obviously, thecloser the event is to the present the more likely it is to happen asprojected. But the further into the future you go, the more time thereis for humans to change and therefore to change the future. It is acommentary on the scale of humanity’s imprisonment of thought thatthe outcome is unfolding very much along the lines that Nostradamuspredicted, but it doesn’t have to. We can change it.Before we move on from this period of the 1600s, we need torecord the beginnings of the most important vehicle of Brotherhoodcontrol and manipulation. It was to give this amalgamation of secret,covert, groupings the power to advance its desire for globaldomination like never before. We call it the world money system.Throughout human history, the purchase of goods and serviceshad been through barter, one thing exchanged directly for another,or by coins which were made from metals which reflected the valueof the coin. This made metals like gold and silver more valuablethan others, because they could be used to make coins and therebycould be exchanged for whatever you liked. But then a series ofevents began to happen. People didn’t want to have all that gold andsilver lying around waiting to be stolen, so it became the custom todeposit these metals with those who had strong rooms where itwould be safe. Many of t½ese strong rooms were owned bygoldsmiths. The goldsmith would give receipts to the customer forthe value of the deposit and when these were returned they wouldhand back that amount of precious metals. The customers began touse these receipts as forms of exchange because they were moreconvenient than moving the metals around and the goldsmiths, andother strong room owners realised that only a small number of thesereceipts were returned to them at any one time by people coming tocollect their metals deposits. So why could they not issue receipts topeople who didn’t actually own any of the metals and then chargethem interest for the privilege? What a great idea. You could lendmoney on metal owned by someone else and charge a fee for doingit! The receipt (money) was worthless if all the owners of your"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"119metal deposits wanted them returned at the same time, but as thisnever happened you were laughing, unless you issued far too manynotes.From this has come today’s banking system which is controlled bythe Brotherhood to further its ends. Banks are allowed literally toinvent money well in excess of their actual assets and chargeinterest on that money. The governments and people of the worldare now submerged under debt to the banks of staggeringproportions, and that debt is money conjured out of nothing by thebanking system. Type in a few figures on a computer screen, movethat number to a person’s account on another part of the computerprogramme, and from that moment you can start charging thatperson interest on money that isn’t yours, and doesn’t physicallyexist. More than that, if a person falls behind in the interestpayments on money you don’t own and doesn’t exist, you can taketheir home and possessions that do exist, and even have them sent toprison.By this simple means you can put governments and people into somuch manufactured debt that they become pawns which you canmove around the board at will. You can force people to do what theyhave no wish to do because they have to earn the money to pay youback the money you did not own in the first place, and it is the samewith governments. It is utterly insane for banks under no governmentcontrol to be given this power to create money out of nothing, but theBrotherhood societies, at the highest level in this case, brought thisinto being and manipulate entire nations and continents with it dayafter day. It has also allowed more wars to be fought and prolonged,because instead of being limited to the assets a country owned, thebankers could now issue pieces of paper to keep the conflict going.Then, after the war, the governments were even further in debt andtheir people would have to suffer more hardships if their country wasgoing to pay back the banks for the money that did not exist. Nowwars not only became wonderful tools of control for the Brotherhood,they were fantastic ways to increase their wealth. They couldn’t lose.They would lend invented money to both sides, charge them intereston it, and then lend them more invented money to rebuild thecountries that had been devastated by those wars. And we, men andwomen of the world, continue to put up with it!

The Bank of England followed in 1694 and became themodel for all the others.These centuries we have discussed were of enormous significance,with the Renaissance opening the minds of Europeans to theknowledge of Greece, the Reformation breaking the power of thePope, and the introduction of the banking system. Within the mass ofthe people, dissatisfaction was stirring at the way they were treatedand the foundations for rebellion and eventually parliamentarydemocracy were in place. It would still take many centuries to arriveand the Church would battle to prevent it, but the cracks hadappeared in their wall of suppression and the flood was sure tofollow."},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"1218Eagle TailsAn area of substantial volunteer activity over the thousands of yearsafter the demise of Atlantis have been the lands we call the Americas.North, South, and Central America were populated by groups ofnomadic and agricultural peoples long before the Sumerians weresettling in Mesopotamia. You would think, if you didn’t know, thatAmerican history began with the coming of the European invaders,but that happened only a few hundred years ago. The Americasevolved with the thousands of tribes which developed with theirdiverse cultures and beliefs. As in the rest of world, some wouldgrow and conquer others to create empires. One of these was theAztecs in what we call Mexico. They were advanced in that theybuilt fantastic pyramids and cities, as did many peoples of theAmericas, but at the same time they slaughtered untold thousands insacrifices to their gods at the whim of the priests. You can see howcivilisations across the world were being affected by some globalconsciousness or the same extra-terrestrial races that encouragedthem to believe the same myths.There are many similarities between the Sumerian and Egyptiancultures and what has been found of ancient American history. Theall-seeing eye is there; so are the pyramids, some with greatsimilarities to those in Egypt. Stories can be found of the gods whocreated human beings and tried to make them their slaves. Thethemes of Atlantis, Sumer, Babylon and Egypt apply equally to theAmericas.One of the intriguing and interesting peoples of the Americas werethe Maya. It is believed that they evolved from another people calledthe Olmecs, and both built amazing pyramids. The connectionsbetween the beliefs of the Maya and the Egyptians are obvious. TheMaya pyramids were faced with limestone as was the Great Pyramidat Giza, and the beliefs in mummifying bodies and the nature of life"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"122after death were similar. I think there is an excellent chance that thesame ET races were responsible for developing both civilisations intheir early days. But the Mayan civilisation lasted for thousands ofyears and we should not fall into the trap of thinking it was alwaysthe same. Some Mayans apparently practised human sacrifice, butthis was not general. These things change. What is termed theClassic Mayan period is reckoned to have been from about 435 to830AD, when their culture seems to have stopped quite abruptly.The Maya settled on the land now known as Guatemala and north toYucatan and in that classic period they devised a measurement oftime very different to our own today. It related to natural energycycles and they devised a mathematical system of numbers andsymbols to work out the cycles and translate them into a form oflanguage. The Maya, some of whom were from highly evolvedVolunteer consciousness, left records of their calendar andmathematical system. They believed that the Earth began a newcycle of evolution in 31 13Bc and that this would be completed in2012. This would link in very well with what I am saying about thePhoton Beam and the many prophecies through the ages of greatchange at this time. Numbers and symbols can be found on the ruinsand artifacts of many ancient civilisations. As we are now beginningto understand again, everything is an energy, numbers and symbolsincluded. Numbers and symbols represent certain energy vibrationsand the Mayan system was a mathematical code for energies andtheir cycles.It’s funny how we have this idea that evolution and understandingcan only progress and cannot go backwards. This belief insists thatpeoples a decade ago let alone 1,500 years ago could not possiblyknow more about Creation than we do. This is a fallacy. Theknowledge exists outside of this dense physical planet and alwayshas. It has been a case of getting that knowledge through theimbalances and the dense vibration of the Earth to our consciouslevels. This could have happened in Central America in 435 far easierthan in the years of religious imposition in Europe and the MiddleEast when minds were slamming shut in their hundreds of thousandsthrough fear and the thought-police.One other point to remember is that while the ancient Maya may begone, their energy has not. When we think we create energy fieldsand so in that former land of the Maya, as with Egypt and elsewhere,the knowledge they worked with is still there waiting to be accessed."},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"123Going to these places and quietly tuning into the energy fields canopen up your understanding quicker than reading a thousand historybooks.

Thesegroups would later move north and evolve into the Inca civilisationcentred around Cusco in the Andes. The Incas worshipped the Sungod, and again this could have been based on an understanding of theconsciousness of the Sun as a purveyor of universal knowledge andwisdom. At their peak the Incas controlled an area of 2,000 miles by200, and they became motivated by power, wealth, and expansion asthe original understanding was lost. The choice of location for thesevolunteer incarnations was linked to the points on the energy gridwhich needed to be worked on. The region that includes LakeTiticaca, Sun Island, Cusco, Machu Picchu, and the Sacred Valley ofthe Incas, is one of the most powerful on the planet.I am not suggesting for a second that the incarnations of thevolunteer consciousness were always shining reflections of virtue.They were men and women of their time and they were affected bythe culture they were born into. They still are. What they had was amore powerful link with their higher consciousness and this had twopositive effects. Firstly information and inspiration could be broughtdown to this level. This showed itself in those who challenged thebigotry of religion and authority and advanced human understandingthrough philosophy and scientific discovery. Secondly, they wereopen channels to ground powerful energies and pass them into thegrid.Some significant volunteer incarnations were in North Americaamong the tribes of what have become known as ‘Red Indians’. The‘Indians’ (Native Americans) understood the basics of the energysystem and their medicine wheels were circles of stones whereceremonies took place at points on the energy grid. Obviously, theywould not have understood exactly what they were doing within theconfines of the physical form, but the connection with the higher selfwas strong enough for them to do what was necessary on the physicallevel. They passed on their understanding in legends and storieswhich contained many truths portrayed symbolically and many"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"124myths, too, I’m sure. More than anything they had a respect for theEarth and the rest of Creation, which led them to take from natureonly what they believed they needed. Every civilisation has its‘classic’ periods as with the Maya when the volunteer consciousnesswas there in numbers for a specific time and task, and so it was withthe Native American tribes through the centuries.The culture was not all-peaceful and all-knowing, nor should wehave expected it to be. There is, I feel, a naive belief that those whocome from higher levels to help the Earth cannot be genuine unlessthey behave ‘perfectly’. The myths ofjesus have sprung from thisidea. It doesn’t matter how evolved your higher self, the incarnatinglower self is still subject to the imbalances, the dense vibration, andthe culture it is incarnating into. The Indian tribes fought each otheras inherited distrust and hatred spanned the generations and being abrave warrior was the way male status was often measured. It wasusually the elders who had seen the consequences of this throughtheir lives who argued against such conflict. Part of a famous speechby Chief Seattle of the Dwamish Indians highlighted this. As a youngman he was renowned as a courageous warrior and leader. But in hislate fifties or early sixties when the white settlers had taken over theUnited States he is reported to have said:“When our young men grow angry at some real or imaginarywrong and disfigure their faces with black paint, their hearts, also,are disfigured and turn black. Then their cruelty is relentless andknows no bounds. Our old men are not able to restrain them... True itis, that revenge is considered gain, even at the cost of their own lives,but old men who stay at home in times of war, and old women whohave sons to lose, know better.”This is an important point. We should not feel guilty about what wehave done or believed in the past. When we are born into a culture ofwhatever kind it may be, we become subject to its conditioning.When our consciousness looks out through the eyes of the physicalform as a child it is bound to be affected fundamentally by what itsees and is told. If the young braves werejudged by their courage aswarriors and their fighting abilities, most children would take onthose same values. A child does not come out of the womb and say Iwant to be a vegetarian. He or she will eat meat if that is what thefamily puts on the plate.

Age and experience can, aswith Chief Seattle, bring wisdom and understanding. But as we alsosee in millions of others the years can increase the power of thatindoctrination. Witness the attitudes of many older people today forevidence of that.I would not wish to give the impression that these incarnations ofthe volunteers all produced people with piercing blue eyes whoblessed their enemies, healed the sick and disappeared on a cloudinto heaven at the end of it. They have had to live with the pressuresof this world and some have gone through an entire physical lifewithout their higher knowledge manifesting. There are many like thattoday, unfortunately. All I am saying is that, overall, these volunteershave done a tremendous amount to keep the Earth and the spiritualunderstandings alive until this time of transformation.So we are looking at the Americas before the European invasionpeopled by tribes and empires of great diversity of culture andoutlook. Some were highly evolved in their understanding, some stillprimitive, some a bit of both. Some were at war with each other,some at peace. None would have known of a saviour god called JesusChrist or even that Christianity and the people of the Middle East andEurope even existed, but they were now to find out in an orgy ofgenocide as the will of the representatives of the Christian godarrived on their shores.Christopher Columbus was born in Genoa in 1436. The Christiandoctrine believed that the Earth was flat, but Columbus studied thewritings of Ptolemy of Alexandria who made astronomical studies inthe second century, and this made him doubt the Christian belief.Columbus came to the conclusion that the Earth was a sphere. Thetravels of Marco Polo and others had revealed the existence of theEast and Columbus believed that if he sailed West he would sailaround the world to reach India and Asia. He planned his epicjourney, but could find no enthusiasm or financial support from hisown people. The Kings of Portugal and Spain also turned him down,and in Spain the Church told him his ideas were impossible becausethey were contrary to Scripture. Henry VII of England also said no."},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"126In the end a group of Spanish merchants supported him and he set outin the Santa Maria, flanked by two other ships, in 1492. For monthsthey sailed until they struck land in what is now the Bahamas. Hediscovered other islands, including Cuba, but to the end of his lifeColumbus believed he had landed in India. Hence we have the name‘West Indies’ and ‘Indians’ to this day.He returned to Spain with gold, cotton, and other ‘finds’ includingtwo natives who were to be baptised into the Christian faith. Thischanged the attitude of the King of Spain and when Columbus sailedagain for ‘India’ the following year he took with him 1,500 men inseventeen ships. The Pope had given him permission to takepossession of all the lands he found in the name of the King of Spainwho had already agreed to share the booty with his Holiness.Columbus became governor of the lands he found. Not only did hetake them from the native population, he introduced slavery andtreated the people with the sort of Christian goodwill that is sowidely documented in this book. Columbus was a devout Christian,always saying prayers, and his brutality against the natives had thefull support of the priests who had travelled with him. Christianitywhich had spread its darkness across the ‘old’ world had now reachedthe Americas.Western Europe was desperate for a share of the spoils whichColumbus had identified and others were soon to follow his pathacross the Atlantic. Vasco Da Gama, a Portuguese, sailed around theCape of Good Hope and on to the real India. A Spaniard, VicentePinzon, who sailed on that first journey with Columbus, led his ownexpedition and found Brazil closely followed by the Portuguese. In1519, Magellan, another native of Portugal, led an attempt to sailaround the World. He died on the journey, but others completed thecircumnavigation, so proving that the planet was indeed a sphere.These journeys and others increased the knowledge of geographyand horizons were widened in all directions. Over the next fourcenturies the powerful countries of Europe would battle for theownership of distant lands throughout Africa, Asia and theAmericas. It was the greatest act of piracy and robbery the worldhas ever seen. The British, Dutch, French, Belgians, Spanish,Portuguese, and others plundered the planet imposing their cultureand religion on the native peoples, mostly killing or banishing intoslavery all who resisted.

He was a Christian zealot who landed there in 1519at the time of the local king called Montezuma. Cortez was treatedwell by the native peoples who thought he was the long awaitedreturn of their god, Quetzalcohatl which translates as ‘Our belovedson’. The beliefs surrounding him are yet more compelling evidenceof a common source connecting the Middle East and the Americas.He was said to have been born to a virgin, Chimalman, who was toldby a heavenly messenger that she would conceive a son withoutsexual intercourse. Quetzalcohatl was also said to have been temptedby the devil, to have fasted for forty days and to have been crucified.But Montezuma’s people were soon to realise that Cortez was nosecond coming of this god. Once he saw the wealth and magnificenceof the culture, he set about killing thousands to force upon themSpanish rule and Christianity. Among their conquests were the landsof the Maya which had continued to be populated by those who cameafter the Classic Mayan period. Accept gentle Jesus as your saviouror we slaughter you was the basic message of the invadingEuropeans. One Spanish historian of the time estimated that twelvemillion natives of South America alone were killed after theEuropeans landed and an even greater number became slaves. It wasclaimed with pride that Great Britain owned so many countries thatthe Sun never set on the British Empire. This glorious empire was,like all of its kind, a means to exploit and dominate for reasons ofriches, resources, and trade. I would not suggest that everything theEuropeans did in these countries was negative and without merit, butthe motivation and imposition behind these conquests was appalling.The consequences of this occupation are still being unravelled.There was no need for all this murder and suffering for thesedifferent cultures to interact. It could have been done for mutualbenefit. But the Luciferic Consciousness had implanted the belief inenough people that whatever you wanted you took by force and youimposed your will and religion. Your god was always on your sideand whatever you did you did for him. As long as you had beenbaptised and believed in St Paul’s saviour-god called Jesus Christyou were guaranteed a place in heaven no matter what you did.Indeed it is even in the Articles of Faith of the Church of England tothis day that good deeds are not the way to salvation.

North America became largely the property of the English andFrench although Pope Alexander VI had ‘given’ the whole of theAmericas to Spain and Portugal, especially Spain (He was aSpaniard). Four years after Columbus discovered the West Indies,two Venetians based in Bristol, England, sailed with the backing ofHenry VII for North America. They were John and Sebastian Cabot,father and son, and they followed the route taken by earlier explorerslike the Vikings who had landed in the New York area five hundredyears before. They called it Vinland.The Cabots discovered the North American coast, but little wasdone about their find for many years and by then the Frenchman,Jacques Cartier, had laid claim for his country to the region of what isnow Eastern Canada. He was followed by another Frenchmen,Samuel de Champlain, who founded Canada and built a fort which hecalled Quebec. His ambition was to convert the native tribes toRoman Catholicism and expand the fur trade, which involved thenative peoples giving him furs in exchange for guns and booze. Hisintervention started wars between the tribes and caused greatdisruption. But he did not convert them to Christianity, not leastbecause the Catholics and Protestants in his midst spend most of theirtime fighting each other. Other Christian missionaries who tried toforce their religion upon the Indians were killed by the very guns thathad been traded for the furs.The religious persecution in Britain and Europe now involved not"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"129only the persecution of Catholics by Protestants and vice versa, butalso the persecution of factions within the Protestant creed whodiffered, often on the most irrelevant details from the Anglican ororthodox Protestant faiths. This drove many Puritans andNonconformists to risk the dangerous and treacherous journey toNorth America. Under James I, who followed Elizabeth, Puritans andPresbyterians were persecuted because James was a staunchAnglican. He also ordered a gruesome purge against ‘witches’(mediums) and his treatment of Roman Catholics was so terrible, twoof their number, Guy Fawkes and Robert Catesby, organised thefailed Gunpowder Plot of 1605 to assassinate him. It was James Iwho took part of Northern Ireland from the Catholics and encouragedit to be settled by England and Scottish Protestants. This set inmotion the centuries of hatred and conflict between the two Christianfractions that created a sort of religious apartheid that still continues.Britain under James I was not a good place to be unless you were anAnglican, and the exodus to America grew. Many Puritans settled ina place they called New England where they matched the violenceand intolerance shown to them in Europe with their own treatment ofthe Indians and others who did not share their misguided Faith. InVirginia, tobacco was the currency and people were fined SOlbs oftobacco for not attending church, 2000lbs for not having their childbaptised, and 5,000lbs for entertaining a Quaker. Death is no cure forignorance and neither is a journey across the Atlantic. This ledWilliam Penn, a compassionate Quaker, to found Pennsylvania in1682, on land given to him by Charles II in exchange for the moneylent to him by Penn’s father. He opened his lands to Quakers and allpersecuted Nonconformists, and he made friends with the Indians. Heshowed how they could live together to their mutual benefit. TheIndians also gave a piece of land to Roger Williams who founded theState of Rhode Island as a haven of peace and religious tolerance.Mostly, however, the North American settlers treated the Indians andpeople of differing beliefs as heathen with no dignity or rights underGod.By the 18th century the French had been driven out of NorthAmerica by the British who treated these lands as an extension of theBritish Isles. But the settlers were beginning to resent this. They stillpaid allegiance to the British King, but they rebelled when they weretold to pay taxes to the British Government without their consent.Troops were dispatched to force the settlers into submission and the"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"130American War of Independence began. Brotherhood-style secretsocieties with the familiar initiations and methods were already atwork in the Americas before the European invasion, but after thattheir numbers simply exploded and they were extremely involved inthe events before the American War of Independence. Freemasonryabounded and George Washington was a freemason, initiated into theCraft at the age of twenty in 1752. As an officer in the colonial army,he is believed by some historians to have ordered the killing ofFrench troops in the Ohio Valley when there was no militaryjustification, let alone a moral one. This created more conflictbetween the British and French which flared in Europe as the bitterand bloody Seven Years War. This claimed around a million militaryand civilian casualties and left both countries with enormous debts tothe money inventors, the banking elite controlled by theBrotherhood. There was also the cost of keeping an army in America.All this led the British to levy higher taxation on her people, andduties on goods in the American colonies, to service the debt, andhence you had the disputes that fuelled the War of Independence. Theresistance in the colonies was so fierce that the British withdrew thenew duties, except for those on tea. The colonists were by nowwhipped up by the Freemason lodges masquerading as revolutionarygroups. Members of the St Andrews Lodge in Boston dressed up asIndians and threw tea into the harbour in protest at the duty and nomatter what the British had done, it was too late. The Brotherhoodwanted independence for America for longer term motives and thatwas the way it was going to be. It is pretty clear that the Freemasonshad been working to stir up revolution against the British for at leastten years before the war began.It was fought over six years until the Americans won and theBritish were sent packing. George Washington was Commander inChief of the American troops and he was to become the firstPresident of the newly formed United States of America. He was afreemason as I have pointed out and so were most, perhaps all, of thekey revolutionaries, many of them were Grand Masters. Masons likeWashington and Franklin had the symbol of the All Seeing Eye sewnonto their sheepskin Masonic aprons. This was without question aBrotherhood revolution. Independence was declared in 1776,although the war went on for some years after that, until the decisiveBattle of Yorktown in 1781 settled the issue of who would rule thecountry. The Americans were supported with arms and resources by"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"131the French after one of the revolutionaries, the freemason, BenjaminFranklin, persuaded them to help. The French were looking for somerevenge for their defeats by the British and even if they were not theBrotherhood network in France would have made sure help wasforthcoming. Franklin secured the services in France of the Germanfreemason Baron von Steuben who had served in the army ofFrederick the Great of Prussia and he was to play a major part inturning the American army into a fighting force. With victory securedthe Declaration of Independence severed ties with Britain.The symbols of the new nation reflected those of the Brotherhoodand its branches which had brought it into being. In 1782 a mancalled William Barton produced a design for the Seal of the newUnited States and it included the classic symbols from theBrotherhood in ancient Egypt - the pyramid topped by an allseeingeye. Below that were the words Novus Ordo Seclorum which mean‘The beginning of a new order of the ages’. This refers to theBrotherhood’s ‘Great work of ages’ and it is expressed today as TheNew World Order. This part of Barton’s design is included in theUnited States Great Seal today, and on the dollar bill. The phoenix,another Egyptian Brotherhood symbol was also on the original sealbefore it was later replaced by the Eagle. American Freemasonrybroke away from its ‘Mother Lodge’ in England after independenceand it adopted the English York Rite of Freemasonry with its tendegrees of initiation and most significantly, the Scottish Rite, withits thirty-three degrees. The Scottish rite in particular has had afundamental influence on American politics, economics, andforeign policy from that time on. The Brotherhood controls theAmerican banks and the Federal Reserve, their version of the bankof England, which creates money out of nothing and plays the tuneto which the elected politicians have to dance. That is not to say thatall the revolutionaries were involved in skullduggery and wished tobring about this abuse of freedom or that the desire for revolutionwas wrong. Why should one country own another in that way?Most if not all the revolutionaries would have believed they weredoing the right thing for the right reasons, but who was controllingtheir thinking from the perspective of another agenda? It is notalways the event itself that is wrong, but the hidden agenda behindit.One man who played an important part in the fight for Americanindependence could rightly be included among the great men of"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"132human history. If ever there was an example of the volunteerconsciousness incarnate, it is he. Thomas Paine was born the son of aNorfolk Quaker in 1736. His outspoken support of the oppressed inEngland and his opposition to religion made him highly unpopularwith the authorities and he went to America to support the people intheir dispute with the British Parliament and King George III. Hefought on the American side and published a pamphlet called‘Common Sense’ which called for complete independence for thecolonies and not some diluted compromise that would still leavethem under British rule. Another pamphlet, ‘The Crisis’, motivatedthe people to go on when the situation looked bleak. His words werewidely read and they are credited with having a significant impact onthe course of the War.He was a renowned figure when independence was won, butinstead of enjoying the glory he returned home to England hoping todo the same there. He wrote The Rights of Man in 1791 whichexposed the corruption and nonsense of Church, monarch, and state,while setting out an alternative society based on democracy,educ4ion and equal rights for all. This was the time after the FrenchRevolution when the British gentry were terrified of a people’srebellion. A writ was issued for his arrest, but his work circulatedrapidly among the poor who at last had someone speaking for them.Anyone found publishing or possessing The Rights of Man was jailedor banished and effigies of Paine with a rope around his neck werecarried through the streets by those whose power he threatened. Hewas a man ahead of his time, but such men are vital to light the fusewhich later explodes into fundamental change. Paine escaped toFrance where he was elected to the new French Assembly. He wasappointed to the committee putting together a new FrenchConstitution and he argued that there should be no bloodshed orreprisals against the monarchy and aristocracy. He wanted to destroythe institutions of repression, not kill the people in them. When hevoted against the killing of King Louis XVI he was arrested andsentenced to death. Here we are again with one tyranny and rule byfear replacing another. George Washington was asked for help, butrefused and it took the efforts of others to win his release a year later.During his captivity he wrote his book, The Age of Reason, whichdismantled the preposterous claims of Christianity which he saidwere not the work of God, but of stupid men. His book said of theBible:"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"133“Whenever I read the obscene stories, the voluptuous debaucheries,the cruel and tortuous executions, the relentless vindictiveness withwhich more than half the Bible is filled, it would be more consistent ifwe call it the word of demon than the word of God. It is a history ofwickedness that has served to corrupt and brutalise Mankind. And formy part, I detest it as I detest everything that is cruel.”Thomas Paine was a great, great, man. ‘The world is my countryand to do good is my religion’, he once said, and the only trinity hehad any time for was Truth, Liberty, and Justice. There have been fewmore decent, loving, brave, and wise people on this planet. Yethistory has largely forgotten him because no juvenile religion was setup in his name. In Christendom you could call for political liberty ifit suited the people, but not for religious liberty. When Paine returnedto America after the publication of the book he was shunned by thosehe had helped to free. In some areas it was even dangerous for him towalk down the street. But then he was used to religious opposition inAmerica, because in earlier times they had opposed his opposition toslavery. The United States was built on the backs of black slavesfrom Africa. Slavery had been part of human life through most ofhistory and some of the Popes were the biggest slave owners of theirday. The idea of the chosen ones having God’s permission to own theheathens was a constant justification. In the Bible we read:“Both thy bondsmen and thy bondsmaids, which thou shalt have,shall be of the heathen that are round about you; of them shall ye buybondsmen and bondsmaids. Moreover, of the children of the strangersthat do sojourn among you, of them shall ye buy; and of their familiesthat are with you, which they begat in your land; and they shall beyour possession. And ye shall take them as an inheritance for yourchildren after you, to inherit them for a possession; they shall be yourbondsmen forever.”That is from Leviticus, and these are the words of St Paul:“Slaves obey your Earthly masters with respect and fear. And withsincerity of heart as you would obey Christ. Obey them not only towin their fovour when their eye is on you, but like slaves of Christ,doing the will of God from your heart.”"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"134The Christian creed had no problem with slavery. It was God’s will.Hundreds of thousands of native Africans were captured by the slaveships of Britain, America, and elsewhere and taken to the New Worldto be sold to the highest bidder. The hymn writer, John Newton, wasthe master on a slave ship and from his pen came How sweet thename of Jesus sounds in a believer’s ear. Opponents to this stunninginhumanity called slavery were hung, shot, and burned alive by theslave owning mobs and sermons were made in support of bothslavery and the violence against protesters. It was a major offence toteach a slave to read, and there were discussions on whether it wasbest to work a slave to death or use them more sparingly so theywould last longer. (The same debate went on in relation to the Jewsin Nazi Germany). The law allowed slaves to be flogged to death andshot if they refused to accept the flogging. Their tongues and eyeswere cut out on many occasions and they were branded if they triedto escape. The British were at the heart of this trade and many Britishcompanies grew wealthy on it. The British built forts off the AfricanCoast to protect the slave traffic and they gave grants of free land inthe West Indies on condition that at least four negro slaves were keptfor every hundred acres.Slavery became an issue which divided the United States veryroughly between North and South. Most Freemason lodges supportedit, but many did not. By far the greatest number of slaves wereconcentrated in the Southern States where they worked in the cottonfields. Some brave people helped a few escape to Canada at great riskto themselves and among them was John Brown, an Ohio wool dealer,who was caught and executed. He became a martyr remembered by thefamous song in which ‘his soul goes marching on’. William LloydGarrison published The Liberator which highlighted the treatment ofthe slaves and was sent to prison for his opinions, but it roused yetmore to the cause. Harriet Beecher Stowe wrote her book, Uncle Tom’sCabin, published in 1852, telling the stories she had heard from theslaves who had escaped. The Pope ordered the book to be banned andthe clergy condemned its publication.In the 1860 presidential election, Abraham Lincoln, an abolitionist,was elected. The South declared independence under its ownpresident, Jefferson Davis, and they increased the powers of slaveowners. The United States were now anything but united. They weretwo nations, one overwhelmingly for slavery and one against.Lincoln, whose desire for the end of slavery was not as fierce as"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"135some, offered to allow it to continue if the South would return, butthey didn’t trust him. The Civil War ensued, but contrary to what iswidely believed it was not about the plight of slaves, but the unity ofthe country. It was like most conflicts, justified by a contradiction.Lincoln and his supporters went to war to preserve the union underthe banner of freedom. But while the behaviour of the SouthernStates was appalling to the slaves, they had every right under theConstitution to withdraw from the union. Lincoln and the Northfought to deny them that right. The emancipation of slaves was a by-product of the war, not the motivation behind it. Slavery continued inthe North until the war was over, and legislation to free Southernslaves during the war was enacted only because it was claimed thatthe Southerners were no longer United States citizens, and thereforehad lost their rights to own slaves as those in the North continued todo. The war was about the withdrawal from the Union by theSouthern States, caused by disagreements over slavery. It was notabout slavery as such.The South, the ‘rebels’ or ‘Confederates’ held the initiative in thefirst phases of the war, but after losing the Battle of Gettysburg in1863 the North, the ‘Federalists’, turned the tide and went on tovictory. By then half a million people had died at a cost of nearlytwo billion pounds to the US economy and the belief that a statecould decide at will to withdraw from the Union as agreed by theFounding Fathers was crushed. The United States was now a nation,as were Germany and Italy in the wake of their civil wars whichhappened in this same period. The USA would produce greatinventors and many skilled in trade and business as they exploitedand directed the Industrial Revolution to become the world’s mostpowerful country.The tragic victims of the expansion across the North Americancontinent in both the United States and Canada were the native tribes.They were pushed into the interior by the settlers who advancedWestwards until there was nowhere left for the Indians to go. Whenthey lost the many battles to retain their homelands they were forcedonto reservations which were, themselves, gradually reduced by theeconomic ‘needs’ of the government. White men did indeed speakwith forked tongue when they made their promises to the Indianswhich were never kept. The story of the genocide of the nativeAmericans by the settlers from Europe is one of the most atrociousepisodes in the long and sorry tale of man’s inhumanity to man. The"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"136reality of these events is only now beginning to be told in films like‘Dances With Wolves’ and the truth is breaking through theHollywood and government propaganda of most of this centurywhich portrayed the Indians as savages and the God-fearing settlersas the agents of freedom and civilisation. In Australia and the othercountries where the invading Christians occupied native lands byforce and brutality the truth of these times is being more widelyunderstood.In my travels to Canada and the United States I have had theoverwhelming feeling that I have had many past lives as an Indian.When I was in Calgary, Canada, I saw a picture of a chief and I felta strong and instinctive bond with him. His name was ‘Sitting onan Eagle Tail’, chief of the North Peigans, one of a group of tribesthat went under the overall name of Blackfoot. Just to complicatematters there was also an individual tribe in the group also calledthe Blackfoot. I travelled through an area known as the PorcupineHills, south of Calgary near the Old Man River and I have rarelybeen moved by a place anywhere in the world. My spirit just sangwith joy. I would later discover that Eagle Tail was one of thosewho signed the land treaty with the white settlers which put theIndian tribes onto reservations and he had chosen an area aroundthe Porcupine Hills and the Old Man River. He loved the area andfelt it was the best place for his people to settle. I talk more of theseexperiences in Truth Vibrations and In The Light Of Experience.Two years after that trip to Canada, I was walking through Oxfordwith Yeva looking for the Pitt Rivers Museum which has a sectiondedicated to Indian history. We were given the wrong directions tothe Museum and we were lost. As we walked I told her aboutSitting on an Eagle Tail and how I felt that was a previousincarnation. At that moment we passed a pub called ‘The Eagle andthe Child’. I looked up at the pub sign hanging from the wall.There before me was a picture of an eagle with a little child sittingon its tail! I have had scores of ‘coincidences’ happen to me sincemy awakening became conscious in 1990, but that was a realstunner.I began to read widely of the Indian period in North America and,as with my visits to former Indian lands, I have felt a deep andpainful sadness at the way that culture and understanding was sweptaway in such a short time. When I visited former Indian lands aroundSedona in Arizona, Monument Valley in Utah, and a their beauty and"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"137the memories of my Indian lives. But underlying that has alwaysbeen sadness at what happened. I read a book about the life of theBlackfoot Chief, Crowfoot, which also spanned the lifetime of EagleTail. It was sobering to see that when they were born the Indian wayof life had remained virtually unchanged for thousands of years; bythe time they died in the latter part of the last century, their tribeswere dependent on hand-outs from the white settlers. Their lands hadbeen taken and their independence was gone. These proud peoplewere lining up on their little reservations to be given their rations.The Christian missionaries had arrived seeking to impose their creedupon the Indian people. The ‘God-fearers’ were rampant and some ofthe most tragic and pathetic pictures I have seen are of Indian people,Bibles in hand and assembled in their Sunday best, waiting to beindoctrinated and mind-controlled in the mission churches built ontheir reservations. Nearly fifteen hundred years after the nonsense ofNicaea, it was now spreading its arrogance and mind control acrossNorth America which, until then, had somehow managed to survivevery nicely without it.It was only in 1877 that Crowfoot and Eagle Tail had, with others,signed the land treaty that confined them to reservations which thesettlers would go on diminishing whenever they could. By then theirtribes had been ravaged by war and diseases like smallpox which thesettlers had brought with them. Every picture I have seen of EagleTail portrays a near-broken spirit and given what happened in hislifetime that is easy to understand.They had been the victims of the industrialisation of the world thathad begun in Britain and spread like a cancer across Europe. Theinflux of settlers from Europe who emigrated in increasing numbersto the ‘New World’ took with them that same religious intoleranceand economic ethos or imported it once they were there. TheLuciferic consciousness was now unleashing everything it couldmuster before the time of the Great Cleansing which was fastapproaching.

People in fear are somuch easier to control, as we shall see. It also had a longer term aim toreplace traditional religion with the Godless version of science calledmaterialism. This was the final stage of the Brotherhood plan topursuade people they werejust physical, one-life, accidents, with nospirit or eternal purpose. The more that people can be encouraged tothink that way the more they become locked in materialism and losetouch with who they are.

Yes there are Jews involved, but so are others ofmany other races, and people of all political persuasions, from capitalistto communist to anarchist. All play their part in the covert game planand the Jews in general have suffered tremendously at times from themanipulation of the Brotherhood. The Protocols do, however, give"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"139such an excellent indication of the Brotherhood’s intentions that Iwill use passages from them through the book. I only came acrossthem after the rest of the book was completed. To overcome themisleading reference to Zion, I will refer to them as the IlluminatiProtocols and from this point I will also use the name Illuminati todescribe the Brotherhood elite who are aware of the real agenda.The Protocols make clear the Illuminati’s view of the masses. Itscontempt of the general population, the Goyim as it calls us, knowsno bounds. It sees us as mere cattle and a mob and, while its analysisis distasteful, it cannot, unfortunately, be accused of inaccuracy in itscontention of how easily most people allow themselves to bemanipulated. The Protocols acknowledge the Brotherhood’s role inthe overthrow of the monarchies:“On the ruins of the natural and genealogical aristocracy of theGoyim we have set up the aristocracy of our educated class, headed bythe aristocracy of money. The qualifications for this aristocracy wehave established in wealth, which is dependent on us ....“ (Protocol 1).“Remember the French Revolution, to which it was we who gave thename of ‘Great’: the secrets of its preparations are well known to us,for it was all the work of our hands. Ever since that time we have beenleading the people from one disenchantment to another.” (Protocol 3).The great majority of people who campaigned for the end of themonarchies and against the imposition of religion, have done so withthe finest of intentions, and it was exactly what needed to happen.The Brotherhood was often pushing against an open door with thatpart of its plan, because people were getting fed up with Church andmonarchs. But while most campaigners wanted to replace both withtrue freedom for the human mind and true democracy, theBrotherhood Illuminati elite had other ideas. It used popularsentiment to overthrow monarchs and reduce the credibility of theChurch, but then used its power to replace them with an illusion ofdemocracy and a science which denied that people have any otherdimension, apart from the physical body.“The abstraction of freedom has enabled us to persuade the mob inall countries that their government is nothing but the steward of thepeople who are the owners of the country and that the steward may bereplaced like a worn out glove.

The Craft was opened up to moreand more people who were not masons or craftsmen by professionand soon they would be by far the majority. In 1717 a new GrandLodge was launched at a meeting in London and some were to callthis the Mother Grand Lodge of the World. This was the lodge theAmerican freemasons were connected with before the War ofIndependence. The old links with the profession of masonry becamepurely symbolic with titles like Entered Apprentice, Fellow Craft,and Master Mason, no longer relating in any way to the masonswork, but only to the levels of initiation within the new Freemasonry,the so called three Blue Degrees. The Mother Grand Lodge quicklyexpanded its influence across Europe and the British Empire, issuingpermission for other branches to practice the Blue Degree System. InScotland, Michael Ramsey would establish another branch ofFreemasonry based on the old Knights Templar system, and whatbecame known as the Scottish Degrees or Rites of Freemasonrywould go on to become the dominant form of the Craft. Today it isthe Scottish Rites, with the thirty-three degrees of initiation, which isbehind the Freemasonic mafia that controls the United States andmany other countries from behind the scenes today.“We shall create and multiply freemasonic lodges in all countries ofthe world, absorb into them all who may become or who are"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"141prominent in public activity, for in these lodges we shall find ourprinciple intelligence office and means of influence.

The Royalists(Anglicans) were defeated by the Roundheads (Nonconformists) andCharles I was executed in 1649. The first attempt at government by thepeople was in fact government by Oliver Cromwell, a morose Puritansquire, who ruled as Lord Protector with the support of his army. Hebanned Anglican services and continued penal laws against theCatholics. Cromwell purged non-believers in his view of Christianityand continued the dreadful treatment of the Irish, while also abolishingamusements, the arts, fun, laughter, and affection. This is how thePuritans interpreted the Bible. Laughter and happiness were a sin.They remind me of those signs you see sometimes in comic storieswhich say: No dancing, no singing, no laughing, no nuffin’. Theyaccepted and expanded upon the beliefs of Calvinism, and theypromoted the extraordinary claims that war and conflict were signs ofspiritual salvation, because it was evidence of the struggle to removeSatan from the Earth. Peace meant that Satan was not beingchallenged! Such thinking governed Britain at this time and would, aswe have seen, also be exported to America with the Puritan ‘pilgrims’.After Cromwell died in 1658, parliament invited the exiled brother ofCharles I to take the throne as Charles II on the understanding thatthere would be religious tolerance. He agreed, but then began a reignof persecution against the Puritans and those who didn’t worship theAnglican Faith. Tens of thousands of Nonconformists were killed,tortured, or shipped off as slaves to the colonies. In Scotland they stillcall this period the Killing Time. What Charles II really wanted to dowas return Britain to the Roman Catholic Faith.This story of Britain is the story of World. It was going oneverywhere with one Faith persecuting another over the interpretation"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"142of a flawed and largely invented book. Almost everything emerged fromreligion or the battle against religious tyranny. The two political partiesat the time were divided on religious lines. The Tories (nowConservatives) were the Anglicans while the Whigs were largelyNonconformists. Through these decades of terrible religious intoleranceand unrepresentative parliaments, many individuals made theircontributions to human consciousness. Isaac Newton made severalimportant scientific discoveries. He studied astronomy and advanced thedevelopment of the telescope. When he saw an apple fall from a tree ittriggered a line of thought which led to him identifying the law ofgravity. But he was also very much involved with the Brotherhood as agrand master of the Priory of Sion. Further discoveries by his successorswould undermine the claims of religion. Writers like John Milton andJohn Bunyan opposed the behaviour of the Church and state, andBunyan spent twelve years in Bedford Jail for refusing to accept theAnglican Faith. George Fox founded the Society of Friends (Quakers).He argued against the Church dictatorship and urged toleration, mercy,and peace. The Quakers have largely been the acceptable face ofreligion, opposing slavery and persecution. Fox was jailed forblasphemy and thousands of his supporters suffered the same fate.The Whigs were behind the next ‘coup’ on the British people. WhenCharles I died in 1685, his brother, James II began a bloody three yearreign of terror which failed in its avowed attempt to restore Papalpower to Britain when he was overthrown by the ‘Glorious Revolution’of 1688. The Whigs, a powerful group of English and ScottishProtestants, may have been a British political party, later to become theLiberals, but they were actually based in Holland. They had close linkswith the Dutch House of Orange and with William, Prince of Orange,who had married Mary, the daughter ofJames II. The House of Orange,like the German royal family, often used marriage to expand its powerand effect bloodless takeovers of other countries. Another branch of theBrotherhood was set up to put William on the British throne. It wascalled the Orange Order and this still continues, particularly in NorthernIreland. It is one of the secret societies which fuels the fires of thatongoing Northern Ireland conflict. The Orange Order was pledged tomake sure that Britain remained a Protestant country, and it was basedon the principles of Freemasonry, a craft of which William was almostcertainly a member, and William was to treat Irish Catholics so badlythat the hatred of him there still festers through the generations.He was crowned William III and ruled over both Britain and"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"143Holland. His wife became Mary II. It was now that the Bank ofEngland was created in the image of the Bank of Amsterdam and theBrotherhood control of the financial system took a mighty step forward.The Bank of England scheme was presented by William Paterson, aScot, but the British parliament was not terribly keen on the idea. Theywere, however, trapped by the Brotherhood. William and Mary hadstarted a war with Catholic France and they orchestrated other conflictsalso. These were costing the country so much of its wealth that Britainwas in terrible debt. They could not put up taxes any higher withoutfear of rebellion, so they reluctantly accepted the Bank of Englandwhich would then issue lots of bits of paper representing money that didnot exist and charge interest to the government (the people) for doingso. As William Bamley writes in The Gods of Eden:“The standard practice of bankers during that period was to issuenotes four or five times in excess of their precious metals. The Bank ofEngland, however, issued an incredible multiplication of 16 2/3rds.The British Government agreed to borrow those notes and honourthem as legal money for use in its purchases. The governmentaccepted this plan because the government was not required to repaythe initial loan, only the interest on the loan. Would not the Bank ofEngland lose money on such a deal?”Not at all.“The face value of the loan notes were many times in excess of thevalue of the actual assets on which the notes were based. The intereston the loan in just one year surpassed the total value of the preciousmetals of the Bank of England! Specifically, the financiers had puttogether a total base of £72,000 of actual gold and silver. By issuingnotes valued at 162/3 times the base, the bank was able to make a loanof £1,200,000 in paper money. The yearly interest was 8 1/3% whichequalled £100,000. This amounted to a profit of £28, 000, or 39% injust one year!”And who paid for that, and still pays for this system of legalisedtheft today? The people. In toil, sweat, and suffering.

The firstHanoverian King, George I, couldn’t even speak English! TheHanoverians were not welcomed by the people who could not see whyGermans should be on the British throne. This allowed the House ofHanover to work a nice little earner. They refused to have a large Britisharmy, because they said they feared a coup given their unpopularity. Andso they enlisted mercenary soldiers from their German homeland at amassive cost to the British people and at a large profit to themselves.At least religious persecution now began to diminish. It would notdisappear, but it would start to fade. It took nearly another hundredyears for Roman Catholics to be allowed to worship in public and theIrish had to wait for this right until 1829. The legal prejudice againstNonconformist Protestants lasted even longer. They were not allowedto sit in Parliament until 1828 and the Anglican Universities ofOxford and Cambridge were only opened to them in 1871.The Pope’s control of Britain was removed by Henry VIII and hisdaughter, Elizabeth I. Now the power of the monarchs to rule as therepresentative of God was similarly curtailed, as parliaments tookover Government. But these were grossly unrepresentativeparliaments and there was little liberation for the masses. You willidentify many themes running through this very brief history. One isthat those who fight for change in the name of freedom often have noregard for the freedom of others once they are in power. Catholicspersecuted Protestants only for Protestants to persecute them whenthe opportunity arose. You still see this in tit-for-tat killings intoday’s trouble spots. The gentry campaigned for parliamentaryfreedom and the end of royal dictatorship, only to deny democraticand human rights to those who might vote them out of power. TheParliamentary gentry ran the country for themselves, the Church, and,although many will not have realised it, the Brotherhood.Most people were in grinding poverty.

The Church received royalties on the profits of many pitsand in Northumberland and Durham alone this was earning them£400,000 a year. This is still a lot of money today, but then it was astaggering sum. No wonder the Church hierarchy never complainedat the treatment of the children, women, and miners. It was left toradicals who were often non-believers to put humanity andcompassion ahead of religious doctrine. Not so the Church. As longas the poor wretches had agreed to be baptised, they were saved forall eternity, so why bother trying to improve their lot on Earth? Whatwas happening to them was God’s will.At one time 223 offences were punishable by death, includingstealing a handkerchief or anything worth over five shillings.Edmund Burke, the Whig politician and philosopher, reckoned it waspossible to get anything through parliament that carried the deathpenalty. People, including children, were flogged in the streets andhanged in public. It was only in the 1960s that Britain abolished thedeath penalty. Many countries and some American states continue toindulge in this barbarism. Into the 19th century wives were stillbeing sold to the highest bidder in British markets and the treatmentof women in general was shocking in its inhumanity. The prisonswere full of ‘debtors’ - people who could not afford to feed theirfamilies, and the poor people couldn’t go to law to fight their case,because the legal system was there primarily to provide an incomefor the legal profession - and control the people. It had nothing to dowith justice. Widows and children of the poor were thrown out oftheir homes when their husbands or parents died. Beggars filled thestreets.This was the world which 1,500 years of Christianity had visitedupon Britain and the rest of Christendom.

A bill of 1807 to introduce state education which waspassed by the House of Commons was blocked by the Bishops in theHouse of Lords. This when only one in seventeen people in Englandcould write. The efforts of other reformers like Joseph Lancaster toeducate the young so frightened the Church that it began to take aninterest in schools. It knew these non-believing reformers would insiston the teaching of knowledge and reason, not theology. Once theChurch realised that education was now inevitable, it wanted to gaincontrol of the curriculum. Still today in England we have Church ofEngland controlled schools in some areas with the local vicar on theBoard of Governors. The Bishops in the House of Lords also opposedevery Reform Bill designed to widen the franchise and give people agreater say in who governs them. They even opposed legislation toabolish the death penalty for thefts of more than five shillings. TheChristian Church civilised the world??The credibility of the Church was fatally breached during theVictorian era in Britain which accelerated the emergence of scientificexplanations for what had hitherto been explained by ludicroustheology. The Church was now fighting a rearguard action trying tostay upright as the ground slipped beneath its feet. Tradition and theclose links of Church and state maintained its privileges andinfluence and this continues to the present day, but its power todictate was fading.Unfortunately, most of the scientists who were underminingreligion’s credibility with their claims and discoveries, people likeCharles Darwin and countless others, were going too far in the otherdirection. They didn’t realise, and most of their successors still don’t,that the evolution of the physical body and that of the eternal us, theconsciousness which activates the physical body, are not the same.We were now being offered a choice between the ridiculouscontentions of Christianity which were fast losing ground, and thematerialist scientists who claimed that the physical world is all thatexists and life after death is a myth.

TheBritish Prime Minister, Benjamin Disraeli, could see some of what wasgoing on when he said this in the House of Commons in July 1856:“There is in Italy a power which we seldom mention in this House. Imean the secret societies.. It is useless to deny, because it isimpossible to conceal that a great part of Europe, the whole of Italyand France, and a great part of Germany, to say nothing of othercountries, is covered with a network of secret societies, just as thesurfaces of the earth are covered with railroads. And what are theirobjects? .... They do not want constitutional goverrnment, they do notwant ameliorated institutions.. they want to change the tenure of theland, to drive out the present owners of the soil, and put an end to theecclesiastical establishments. Some may even go further.”One of the groups in Italy he was referring to was the Mafia.Giuseppe Garibaldi, a thirty-third degree Mason and Grand Master ofItaly, had led the rebellion in the Italian wars of unification and theMafia, up until then a secret society resisting foreign rule in Sicily,"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"148supported him.

One of the most notoriousfreemason lodges is also based in Italy. It is known as P2 and itcontrols the Vatican.We saw our familiar theme at work again in these Victorian andEdwardian times. The science which had for so long beensuppressed and crushed by the Church, was winning its freedom toresearch and discover knowledge which the priests would ratherhave remained hidden. But when open minded scientists foundevidence to challenge the materialist this-world-is-all-there-is viewof the establishment scientists their work was likewise suppressedand crushed by their own colleagues. Instead of one powerfulinterest group suggesting that reincarnation and eternal life foreveryone did not exist, now there were two. The last thing theBrotherhood wanted was for the population to know the spiritualtruths.Both ‘science’ and religion were fierce in their opposition to thegrowth in interest in Spiritualism during the Victorian era. Mediumswere, until 1951, liable to a fine and imprisonment for the crime ofbeing a medium, but their art began to return to public attentionthanks to the emergence of Spiritualism. The law of the landincorporated the Church’s contention that contact with the ‘dead’ wasimpossible and therefore anyone claiming to do so must by definitionbe a fraud. Little did the people know that Queen Victoria had amedium working with her for many years after the death of herhusband, Albert, the Prince Consort. Arthur Findlay revealed thestory for the first time in The Curse of Ignorance in 1947. He wasgiven the details by the daughter of James Robert Lees who, as athirteen year old, was found to have outstanding psychic gifts. Onecommunicator claimed to be the entity who had been Prince Albertand he asked that he be allowed to speak with Victoria.The Queen, who had been grief-stricken by his death, heard of thisand sent along two members of her court to investigate. They posedas members of the public who wanted to see what the boy could do.He began to channel Prince Albert, who proceeded to greet the twocourtiers by their correct names and he said he knew they had beensent by Victoria.

He also wrote a letter to her through the hand"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"149of Robert Lees, a process called automatic writing. The contentsgreatly impressed the Queen, and Robert was invited to meet her andchannel Albert in her presence. She was not in the least phased by allthis, because she had experienced sittings with other mediums beforethe Prince’s death. She invited Robert to become a permanentmember of her court where he could channel her husband whenevershe wished. But Albert said he could communicate through the son ofa worker on her Balmoral estate, a man called John Brown. He wassummoned, and a long relationship began between John and theQueen. Through him, Albert would advise her throughout the rest ofher life. When John Brown died the Queen wrote about him andintended to publish her work, but she was persuaded not to do so byher Private Secretary, Sir Henry Ponsonby, and Dr. Davidson, theDean of Windsor and later Archbishop of Canterbury. He had longopposed her interest in Spiritualism and threatened to resign as CourtChaplain if she published anything about John Brown. Ponsonby alsodestroyed Brown’s private diaries to make sure the truth was neverrevealed.Spiritualism, the belief in the ability to communicate withdiscarnate souls, had begun in the United States in the mid 1800s andspread to Europe. In Britain it had a number of famous advocatesincluding the scientists Sir Oliver Lodge, Sir William Crookes, andSir William Barrett, and the writers Victor Hugo and Sir ArthurConan Doyle, author of the Sherlock Holmes stories. The scientistswere dismissed by their fellows, but they had begun to understandthe nature of vibrations and how many worlds could share the samespace. Conan Doyle dedicated his later life to the cause ofSpiritualism at a time when the escapologist, Houdini, was running avirtual witch hunt against mediums in the United States.In 1938, a committee appointed by the Church reportedfavourably on its investigations into Spiritualism, but Dr Lang theArchbishop of Canterbury refused to publish it. He was, however,quite happy to pass into the public arena the report of anothercommittee at that time which supported belief in the AnglicanChurch’s Thirty-nine Articles of Faith. As twenty-one of the twenty-five members of the committee were priests we should not besurprised at their verdict. If only Victoria and others had stood upand revealed their experiences and beliefs, the suppression ofknowledge by Church and science would have been broken by now.Instead it is left to our generations to do it."},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"150The movement and religion of Spiritualism deserves great creditfor keeping the understandings alive in the face of tremendousopposition from the Church and materialist science. The scientistsbecame dominant in the public mind, and although medicineprogressed enormously in its understanding, it, too, failed toacknowledge that there is more to the human being than a physicalbody. Again the materialist view held sway in medicine and thefoundations of the ‘tradition’ thus created are still with us today. Themost important advances in human health were the improvement insanitation and water supplies, although atrocious poverty and terribleliving conditions remained the lot of the majority. This was despitethe increasing wealth of the rich and the country in general gainedthrough the exploitation of the people and the Empire. In this periodfrom Victoria to the present day the world would discover the meansof mass production; electricity; radio; television; the telephone; theaeroplane; spacecraft; the list goes on and on. The freedom of manyhuman minds from the religious thought-police unleashed so muchpotential - more than the public have been told about, as we shalldiscuss later.

All over the worldinventions and discoveries were coming to light which changed thenature of work, life, and the potential for both construction andcatastrophe. I will look at the economic and environmentalconsequences of this in chapter 11, but here I wish to expand on thedifference between cleverness and wisdom.To unlock the secrets of nature’s potential is clever, but it takeswisdom to (a) use that knowledge for positive and constructivepurposes and (b) to have the humility to appreciate that there isalways, but always, a great deal more to know. As Socrates said:“Wisdom is knowing how little we know”. The scientist Carl Saganwas also correct when he pointed out that intellectual capacity is noguarantee against being dead wrong. The Victorian and post-Victorian world has not understood that and humility has rarelybeen a feature of the human condition among those in power. So thetrue nature of life and creation went on being ignored by the Churchand the scientific establishment, even though Socrates and Plato hadknown the basis of it in Ancient Greece.

Unfortunately,as we have seen, the behaviour of Church, Brotherhood and Stateover the period covered in this book has programmed the collectiveconsciousness to pass on its responsibility to think and act to others,the Pope, priests, kings and queens, dictators, gentry, bosses, theBible, the Koran, whoever and whatever they can find. Humanity ingeneral has been programmed to think and behave like robots and toindoctrinate their children to do the same. This they have done. Whenyou look at all the slaughter, the invasions and counter4nvasions, thebloody persecutions over minute differences in the same religiousfaith, the mass of the people never benefited from any of them.

The Rockefellers are one of America’s best-knownfamilies. They became famous afterJohn Davidson Rockefeller andhis brother, William, made their fortune with the highly-controversialStandard Oil Company with its web of financial wheeler-dealingwhich noone could fathom. J.D.Rockefeller’s grandson, Nelson,would become a Vice-President of the United States and play aleading part behind the scenes, too, in the course of US politics.The Rothschilds are a European banking dynasty started by MeyerAmschel Rothschild who was born in Germany in 1744. The namecomes from the red (rot) shield on the house in a ghetto in whichMeyer’s ancestors once lived. By 1820, the Rothschild empire hadbranches in London, Paris, Vienna and Naples. They made vastprofits from the Napoleonic and French Revolutionary Wars of 1792to 1815 and had a very significant influence on the course ofEuropean history. They diversified into railways, coal and otherindustrial investments.Meyer Amschel Rothschild summed up the approach of theBrotherhood bankers and the Illuminati elite when he said: “Giveme control over a nation’s currency, and I care not who makes the]’ laws.’’The Rockefeller and Rothschild empires will feature in the storyfrom now on, but I want to stress most emphatically that I will behighlighting certain individual people and the way in which theempires have been used. I do not wish to suggest that everyone calledRockefeller or Rothschild is involved. Most of them will not knowwhat is going on either."},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"154At the centre of the gathering empire of the banking and industrialelite was the Round Table. This had been founded, quite possiblywith the best of intentions, by an Englishman, Cecil Rhodes, afterwhom Rhodesia was named, before its independence. Supported bythe Rothschild empire, he made a colossal fortune exploiting thediamond reserves and resources of South Africa. Rhodes oftenexpressed a desire to stop wars by creating a world government,centred on Britain, which could intervene in disputes before theybecame violent. In 1891 he set up his now infamous Round Tablewhich was obviously inspired by the King Arthur stories. It wasdesigned on Brotherhood lines with secret rituals, inner and outercircles, and much of the other paraphernalia of such organisations.Among the supporters of the Round Table were Lord Rothschild,head of the Rothschild empire in England, and another Englishbanker, Alfred Milner. But it was after Rhodes died* in 1902 that thebig switch was made and the Illuminati, in classic fashion, hijackedhis creation.The international Brotherhood bankers began to give the RoundTable substantial financial support and these backers included theRockefellers. The Round Table was used to coordinate the activitiesof central banks and Brotherhood bankers across the world and toincrease enormously their influence on governments. The Tablecreated other branches to further, and also to mask, its activities.Adam Weishaupt, a German professor who started a famous branchof the Illuminati in 1776, said: “The great strength of our Order liesin its concealment; let it never appear in its own name, but alwayscovered by another name, another occupation.” These ‘front’organisations were to include the Council on Foreign Relations in theUnited States, and, in the British Empire, the Royal Institute ofInternational Affairs. Both were created to direct the foreign policy ofgovernments to suit Brotherhood ambitions. David Rockefeller waschairman of the Council on Foreign Relations for many years. Todayit has infiltrated its people and policies throughout United Statesgovernment. This Brotherhood illuminati elite began to infiltrate theuniversities and the media, and this is now widespread. It controls themedia, for sure. Dr Carrol Quigley wrote of this time:* Cecil Rhodes bequeathed large sums of money to found the “Rhodes Scholarships” toOxford University for overseas students and to promote his belief in a one worldgovernment. The most famous “Rhodes Scholar” today is Bill Clinton."},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"155“There grew up in the 20th century a power structure betweenLondon and New York which penetrated deeply into university lift, thePress, and the practice of foreign policy. In England the centre wasthe Round Table group, while in the United States it was J.P. Morganand Company, or its local branches in Boston, Philadelphia, andCleveland.”The aim of the Brotherhood banking and political network was tocreate a world financial system in which the central banks and otherprivate banking interests would work together. They would coordinatetheir activities to control governments and economies by creatingbooms and busts, manipulating foreign exchanges and bribingpoliticians with well-paid jobs in the financial world. You can see allof these things happening daily every time you pick up a newspaper.The centre of this banking network was to be the Bank forInternational Settlements, based in Basle, Switzerland. Theoverwhelming aim of this banking cartel was to create a situation inwhich governments were so deeply in debt to them that they had to doas the bankers demanded. Like lambs to the slaughter, governments allover the world have fallen for it, or, through Brotherhood channels,helped to arrange it, the United States, more than anyone.The idea of a central bank inventing money that doesn’t exist haslong been controversial in America. Two of its founding fathers,Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, wanted any such bank to beunder government control. They could see the dangers of any othersystem. But another, Alexander Hamilton, was determined to create aCentral Bank in private hands. His backers were reputed to be theBank of England and the Rothschilds. By 1786, the US was plungedinto its first major economic depression caused by the lending andinterest policies of the money-out-of-nothing banks, includingHamilton’s own Bank of New York. Heavy taxes were levied on thepopulation to pay for the interest on bank loans to the federalgovernment and the state authorities. Farmers were ruined by thebanks and Captain Daniel Shay led two thousand desperate farmersto take over a number of towns in Massachusetts, most famouslyWorcester. They wanted an end to interest banking, but Shay’sRebellion, as it was termed, was put down.When George Washington became President in 1789, he madeHamilton the Secretary to the Treasury. Two years later, Hamilton gothis way when the Bank of the United States, the new nation’s first"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"156central bank, opened its doors. It was privately owned, but theGovernment entrusted to it the country’s finances. Only five yearslater, the taxes imposed on the people were so high, to pay theinterest on borrowing from this bank, that farmers again rebelled, thistime in western Pennsylvania. This socalled Whisky Rebellion wascrushed on the orders of George Washington. The Bank of the UnitedStates lost its power in the 1830s when President Andrew Jacksonwon his ‘bank war’ against Nicholas Biddle, the president of thebank. But, early in the next century, this would be replaced bytoday’s Federal Reserve system, the private banking network thatcontrols the US economy for its own benefit.President Woodrow Wilson came to office in 1909 and one of hisclose aides was a man called Colonel House. It was House whoactually controlled events and his masters were the Brotherhoodbanking interests, not the American people. His brief from thebankers was to ensure that the administration introduced the FederalReserve system and the income tax bill known as the Federal IncomeTax Amendment (the 16th Amendment to the AmericanConstitution). This combination would be the means of controllingthe US economy. The Federal Reserve would lend the governmentenormous amounts of largely4nvented money to boost the economyand, when it suited the bankers, the Federal Income Tax Amendmentwould suppress the economy by raising taxation. The manner inwhich both were introduced raised much criticism. President Wilsonmust have had some idea of what was going on behind the scenes. Heonce talked of “A power so organised, so complete, so persuasive,that they had better not speak above their breaths when they speak incondemnation of it.”Persuading people to do what you want them to do, while believingthey are doing the opposite is a method constantly used by theBrotherhood. The Federal Reserve Bill was painted as a measure tocurtail the power of banking interests and those same interestsopposed the idea to add to the conjuring trick. The plot was hatchedat a meeting of Illuminati bankers and industrialists at Jekyll Island,Georgia, towards the end of 1910. The location of the meeting wasextremely symbolic in that, while the Brotherhood was playing DrJekyll, it was really Mr Hyde. The Federal Reserve Bill was pushedthrough Congress in the last few days before Christmas 1913 andCongressman Charles A Lindbergh, senior, the father of the aviator,recognised the sleight of hand for what it was. He said that the"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"157financial insiders had only opposed the Federal Reserve legislationbecause they wished to promote the fiction that it was a ‘People’sBill’.

Thenew law will create inflation whenever the trust wants inflation.“The Federal Reserve was, and still is, hailed as a victory fordemocracy over the Money Trust. Nothing could be further from thetruth. The whole Central Bank concept was engineered by the verygroup it was supposed to strip of power.”The Federal Reserve system has refused to be audited since the dayit was formed. It is so important for everyone to lift their eyes fromwhat appears to be a certain situation, because this type of doublebluff is being used all the time to make us act in the interests of theIlluminati, while thinking we are doing the opposite. When the planwas first presented by the Republicans it was rejected by Congress.There was a feeling in the public mind that the Republicans were tooclose to banking interests. The Brotherhood had an answer for that.They got the Democrats to present it and it was passed! Only twostates agreed to the Federal Income Tax Amendment and it requiredat least thirty-six if it was to be legally ratified. When this wasobviously not going to happen, the Secretary of State, Filander Knox,simply told Congress in 1913 that the amendment had been ratified,even though it had not. From that moment, all the income tax paidunder the Act through the Internal Revenue Service has been purelyvoluntary (although everyone is told it’s the law) and all the moneythat people have been forced to pay by the IRS has been a theft! TheIRS is a private organisation controlling the federal tax system ofAmerica, and it is a Brotherhood tool*. The financial network, led bythe Rothschilds, the Rockefellers and others, was now in place forthe biggest Brotherhood project so far - the First World War.In the first years of this century a number of secret, mysticalsocieties in Germany began to promote the idea of a master race.* A secret document “Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars” reveals that the IRS passes personaldetails about American people to the Brotherhood manipulators."},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"158They claimed the white Aryan race was superior to all the others andsaid the Germans were a part of that.

He believed thatGermany could breed a super-race to lead Europe into a New Order.He was fiercely anti-Jewish.Wilhelm II, the Kaiser of Germany, was another religious fanaticwho believed he was God’s representative on Earth. He was an avidreader of Chamberlain’s work and met him to discuss their mutualbelief that Germans were God’s chosen people and should rule thewhole of Europe, if not the world.

Itwas now that T.E.Lawrence, ‘Lawrence of Arabia’, organised a revoltby the Arabs against the Turks. The British went on to occupyPalestine, Jerusalem and Mesopotamia. The courage anddetermination of the Russian people in defending their land from theGermans, at a cost of four million casualties, had done much tostretch the German resources and reduce their ability to breakthrough in France. But, in 1917, they agreed a peace treaty withGermany after the Russian revolution or, rather, the RussianBrotherhood Revolution.There had been riots and unrest for a long time over the often cruelpersecution of the people by the Tsars. There were strikes andmutinies in the Russian army, and Tsar Nicholas II was taken toSiberia where he and his family were executed by a bunch of extremerevolutionaries who were no more enlightened in their humanity thanthe Tsars they removed. The more moderate reformers were castaside by the followers of Lenin and Trotsky. They abolished plans fora parliamentary constitution and imposed upon an already oppressedpeople the Communist State which replaced Tsarist fascism with statefascism. This had all the same economic and political flaws of thecapitalism it so despised. It was capitalism under another name andwith greater control of the economy. One extreme is invariablyfollowed by another, because of the absence of wisdom.

If they will use violence to win power they will useviolence against the people to keep it. Violence is not something youcan switch on and off. It is either in your psyche or it is not.So who was really behind this ‘Revolution of the People’?Freemasonry was at the heart of it. Coil’s Masonic Encyclopaediasays that there was a Supreme Masonic Council in Russia with fortysubordinate groups at the start of the war. Tsar Alexander had becomeso concerned at the agenda of Russian freemasonry that he hadbanned the craft in August 1822 when its own Grand Master hadwarned him that it was a threat to the state and should be stopped orreorganised. You can see that the Brotherhood does not speak onlywith one voice. Playing one against the other is all part of thestrategy. This decree was renewed by Tsar Nicholas but, asfreemasonry is a secret society, the subversion went on. It was rightthat the Tsar’s abuse of power should end but, again, it is the secretagenda behind this that we have to watch.The Germans naturally supported Lenin and gave him safe passage ina sealed train across Germany from Switzerland on his way to Russia,because they wanted them to withdraw the Russians from the war. Theyalso gave him and his Bolshevik revolutionaries tens of thousands ofmarks for propaganda and to make sure the revolution succeeded. Whata surprise, then, that after Lenin 5 coup against the provisional‘people’s government’ the Russians pulled out of the war and allowedthe Germans to concentrate on other fronts! The Communists weresupported by German and other Western bankers and financiers. TheGerman banker, Max Warburg, supported Lenin’s regime. So did theAmerican banker, Jacob Schiff. His family originated in Germanywhere it had enjoyed close links with the Rothschild banking empire,the key financial supporter of the revolution. The father of modernCommunism and of the beliefs which the Bolsheviks promoted is saidto be Karl Marx, who died in 1883. He was a member of a Brotherhoodorganisation, the League of the Just (later the Communist League), anoffshoot of the Society of the Seasons which played a major part in theFrench Revolution. The German industrialist, Friedrich Engels,supported Marx and wrote with him the Communist Manifesto onbehalf of the secret societies which were behind them. Fifteeninternational bankers used the cover of a Red Cross mission in 1918 totravel to Petrograd to support the original revolution, the provisional‘people’s government’, and the Bolsheviks who would replace it.Professor Stuart Crane pointed out the scam:"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"161“If you look back at every war in Europe......you will see that theyalways ended with the establishment of a balance of power. Withevery reshuffling there was a balance of power in a new groupingaround the House of Rothschild in England, France, or Austria. Theygrouped nations so that if any king got out of line, a war would breakout and the war would be decided by which way the financing went.Researching the debt positions of the warring nations will usuallyindicate who was being punished.”Or as the Illuminati Protocols put it in the 1800s:“Throughout all Europe, and by means of relations with Europe, inother continents also, we must create ferments, discords and hostility.Therein we gain a double advantage. In the first place we keep incheck all countries, for they well know that we have the powerwhenever we like to create disorders or to restore order . . . . In thesecond place, by our intrigues we shall tangle up all the threadswhich we have stretched into the cabinets of all states by means ofpolitics, by economic treaties, or loan obligations. In order tosucceed in this we must use great cunning and penetration duringnegotiations and agreements, but, as regards what is called the‘official language’ we shall keep to the opposite tactics and assumethe mask of honesty and compliancy . . . . We must be in a position torespond to every act of opposition by war with the neighbours of thatcountry which dares to oppose us: but if these neighbours shouldalso venture to stand collectively against us, then we must offerresistance by a universal war.” (Protocol 7)Communism was a form of designer politics created by theBrotherhood as an opposition to the ‘free’ society of America.Millions of dollars of Brotherhood money* was poured into theRussian revolution because the fear of a Russian ‘bogeyman’ wasgoing to be used when the time was right. Russia became abogeyman on ice waiting to be exploited thirty years later.

Gold is their greateconomic weapon."},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"162in a godless world was exactly what the Brotherhood wished themasses to believe.The secret societies of the Brotherhood had taken control of theintelligence agencies that had emerged since the 17th century and soit was with the Tsarist intelligence agency, the Okhrana. There isgreat illusion that the secret services of the world are set up inopposition to each other when, in fact, at the highest level, wellabove anyone known to the public, they work largely as one unit.Even the lower levels of these agencies don’t realise that, but they arestooges for the Brotherhood, too. Intelligence agencies areorganisations (the Brotherhood) within organisations. There is asecret world government which is continually destabilising anddirecting the actions of nation states. In typical Brotherhood fashion,Lenin and the Bolsheviks were attacking the Tsar for the brutality ofthe Okhrana while, behind the scenes, the Okhrana were supportingthe Lenin revolution! The Okhrana were supplying funds andundermining the revolutionary opposition to the Bolsheviks, whilemany of the main protagonists within the Bolshevik movement wereits members. The soon-to-be Soviet dictator, joseph Stalin, was, at thevery least, extremely close to the Okhrana, probably a member. Thefirst editor of the Communist mouthpiece, Pravda, was from there.It is no surprise, therefore, that when Lenin and his supporterscame to power, the intelligence agency they apparently so hated andcondemned was greatly expanded and given a change of name - fromOkhrana to the KGB. The revolution of the people was just anotherball and chain in disguise. There was a considerable Jewish flavourto the revolution, and the Brotherhood was now preparing the groundfor a return of the Jews to Palestine. Some research I have seenclaims that, of 388 members of the Russian RevolutionaryGovernment in 1918, only sixteen were Russians by birth. All buttwo of the rest were Jews from elsewhere, mostly from New York.How people have been tricked right through the ages to the presentday. The Brotherhood was deeply involved in all the ‘people’srevolutions’ which exploded after the American War ofIndependence. This includes, as we have seen, the French Revolutionwhich led to the extermination of at least 100,000 people in theReign of Terror that followed.The blow for the Allies of losing Russian support against theGermans in World War I was compensated by the arrival of theAmericans. President Woodrow Wilson led them into the war when"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"163Germany began a policy of sinking all shipping of whatevernationality, or rather that’s what the allies said. The sinking of theAmerican ship, the Lusitania, was simply the excuse PresidentWilson had been looking for to justify entering the war, and I have nodoubt that the sinking was manufactured by him in collusion with theBritish. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor would be used byPresident Franklin D Roosevelt in the same way in the Second WorldWar. As Commander Joseph Kenworthy of British Naval Intelligencesaid:“The Lusitania was deliberately sent at considerably reduced speedinto an area where a U-boat was known to be waiting and with herescort withdrawn.”The Lusitania was carrying military supplies for Great Britain andwas not, as the Americans claimed, merely a passenger vessel.Slowly, after the US soldiers arrived in Europe, the initiative turnedagainst Germany and Wilhelm surrendered and abdicated, to beallowed to live out his life in comfort in the Netherlands. With hisgoing, the German monarchy ended. This was the war which hadbeen fought for the first time with the submarine, aeroplane and tankand this had taken everything onto a new level of horror anddestruction. By the time it ended, tens of millions of men, women andchildren had lost their lives in a war manufactured by theBrotherhood for its own purposes. Words just cannot describe howthat makes you feel. Germany was ordered to pay reparations to thenations she had attacked and agreed to accept strict limitations on thesize of her armed forces. The Austrian Empire was divided into theindividual states of Austria, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, andYugoslavia, an amalgamation of Serbia, Croatia, Slovenia,Montenegro, Dalmatia and Bosnia Herzegovina. The colonies ofthe defeated countries were shared out among the victors under theheading of ‘protectorates’. Syria went to France while Britain washanded Palestine, Jordan and Iraq. It’s hard to believe that countriescould be passed around like this, but it happened in this century.In Britain, the war had hastened social reform and the widening ofthe franchise. After the French Revolution in 1789, the British gentryhad been so terrified that it added yet more capital offences to thestatute book and imposed even harsher laws against rebellion of anykind. But, when they could see their possessions under threat from a"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"164foreign power, they began to make concessions to the oppressed,because they knew they needed them to defend their wealth. Also,with every widening of the franchise, the power of the upper classelite was curtailed, though not that of the Brotherhood elite.The rights of all children to an education had to be won in stagesagainst Church and factory-owner opposition but, in 1918, came themost important victory yet in the form of the Education Act. Thisensured a full-time education for all children up to the age offourteen, and ended the practice of children going to work for halfthe day and school for the rest. It also introduced nursery schools andmedical checks for children at school. The only sad thing was that theChurch would continue to have a significant say in the education ofchildren with the Bible taught as if it were historical fact. Thiscontinues even today.The most significant development in the years between the warswas the rise of the dictator to replace monarchs and fledglingdemocracies. Here again it shows how desperate are the people forsomeone to lead them and tell them when to breathe; how theBrotherhood exploited that! The American President, WoodrowWilson, proposed an organisation called the League of Nations afterthe First World War, to arbitrate disputes between countries beforethey became violent. It was a fine idea in theory, but, in practice, itwas the first tentative and unsuccessful attempt at a centralised bodyon which to base a World Government. The Brotherhood is veryadept at presenting something in terms that seem highly laudable,which can brilliantly obscure the hidden agenda. The League ofNations struggled into life but quickly collapsed because everyoneignored it.The support of the Roman Catholic Church for the dictators is notsurprising. Its survival depends on the suppression of knowledge andthe imposition of belief. Here we were in the first thirty-odd years ofthis century, seeing the expansion of education, materialistic sciencesand more democratic political systems and the Roman Church wasgetting very worried as support for Christianity fell away. They knewthat what they needed was a return to the old days of repression andoppression when they ran the show. The Vatican has also been run toa larger or lesser extent by the Brotherhood for centuries, probablyfrom the start, and if; by mistake, they elect a Pope who won’t playthe game, he conveniently dies, as was the case with Pope John PaulI in 1978. His successor, Pope John Paul II, has recinded a ban on"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"165freemasonry imposed by Pope Clement XII in 1738. Clement at leastknew what was going on and wished to stop it. In 1978, the year JohnPaul II took the papal throne, a special issue of Vatican stampsfeatured the triangle and all-seeing eye. Celebrating an Illuminativictory, perhaps?Pope Pius XI and those who controlled the Vatican saw BenitoMussolini as the man who could lead them to a return to pastglories. The global financial crash of the 1920s brought greathardship which proved fertile ground for a dictator to step forwardand hoodwink the people into believing he had their best interests atheart. Mussolini, the son of a blacksmith, came to power in theaccepted way of dictators, through bribery, corruption, murder andsupport from the secret societies. He was obsessed with restoringthe Roman Empire and his brand of violence and patriotism were sosuccessful that the king gave him control of the state to avoid a civilwar. Once ensconced, he removed all democratic rights and freedomof expression. The Roman Catholic Church supported him in all ofthis. He knew that he could have free and constant propaganda fromthe pulpits of Italy if he had the Church on his side. They were giventhe Vatican City with independence from Italy, and the Church wasgiven control, once more, of all education along with a donation of£19 million. When Mussolini invaded Abyssinia the Pope gave himhis full support. It was the same when Mussolini went for Albaniaand Greece. Nothing would have delighted the Roman Catholicleaders more than to have control over the lands of the GreekOrthodox Church they so hated. These two Christian creeds hadparted company, you will recall, after the Pope added the words‘and from the Son’ (the Filoque) to the Christian creed in 1054.Many Christians refused to accept this and they formed thebreakaway Orthodox Church which later looked on Moscow as itsown particular Rome or Mecca. Seventy thousand Jews werebanished from Italy by Mussolini without a single word of protestfrom the Vatican. Italy was now controlled by a double dictatorshipof Church and State, and both of them were controlled by theBrotherhood.The Pope was also on friendly terms with Adolf Hitler after a largeRoman Catholic vote swept him to power in Germany in 1933.Germany was in a desperate state, a country in physical andeconomic ruin after the war. With the end of the monarchy, a republicwas declared at a meeting at Weimar in 1919, but it was always"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"166struggling against Communist, royalist, far right, and Brotherhoodopposition. Most of all, it was destroyed by a collapsed economy. Butthen, if you control the financial system, undermining a country toprepare the ground for a revolution is no problem. The 1929 WallStreet crash in the United States was similarly engineered. TheBrotherhood bankers created inflation and encouraged the stockmarket to overstretch itself; so making a crash inevitable. All thestock markets of the world are manipulated in this way. TheDepression of the 1920s was the time of the ‘Turkey Shoot’, as it wasknown. By 1921, there were 31,076 banks in the U.S. The giantbanks of the Brotherhood elite decided it was time to reap theirharvest. The Federal Reserve announced a series of new regulationswhich they realised the smaller banks could not meet in such bleakeconomic conditions. This forced thousands of them out of business -16,000 failed in eleven years. The Brotherhood bankers haddestroyed the competition. They increased their own assets byabsorbing the failed small fry and all those in debt to them. TheFederal Reserve, having achieved its task, then reduced thetoughness of the regulations. Franklin D Roosevelt, with supportfrom these elite bankers, announced his famous New Deal policy tolift the U.S. out of depression. This involved the governmentborrowing enormous sums from the bankers and the debt ofgovernment and population exploded again. Congressman LouisMcFadden, a Chairman of the House Banking and CurrencyCommittee, said that the Great Depression of the 1920s.......... was not accidental. It was a carefully contrived occurrence....The International Bankers sought to bring about conditions of despairhere, so they might emerge as rulers ofus all.”It was the same in Germany where the seeds of dictatorship weresown. Enter Adolf Hitler, a former house painter and First World Warlance-corporal, who had been much impressed by the methodsemployed by Mussolini. But Hitler’s obsession with Germany as themaster Aryan race went back much further. As a youth he would takehallucinogenic drugs to stimulate his mystical experiences. Theswastika, which Hitler was to use as the emblem of his Nazi party,was a Brotherhood symbol going back to ancient times. He was muchimpressed as a youngster by a book-shop owner in Vienna whopreached the gospel of the German super-race, which some believed"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"167was created by extra-terrestrial giants. Houston Stewart Chamberlain,the writer who so influenced Kaiser Wilhelm, was later to claim thatHitler was the new messiah, and Chamberlain’s work would becomethe basis of Nazi philosophy.Hitler’s rise to German Dictator quickened rapidly after he joinedthe secret political branch of the Army District Command whichwas a law unto itself. It was so deeply patriotic that it assassinated,for crimes against the nation, some of the people who hadnegotiated the peace terms for Germany at the end of the FirstWorld War. The District Command was really the assassinationwing of a secret Brotherhood group called the Thule Society whichbelieved in all the nonsense about the super-race and the Germanmessiah. It sentenced people to death in its own secret ‘courts’.Hitler and the Thule Society believed they were being guided by theextra-terrestrials who had created the Aryan race, or what they saidwas a race. The same industrialists financed both the Thule Societyand the District Command. Deitrich Eckart, the morphine addictwho headed the Thule Society, saw Hitler as the Messiah figure theyhad been looking for. They ensured that he became the leader of theGerman Workers’ Party. This was transformed into the fascistNational Socialist (Nazi) Party and Hitler sought to spread his anti-Jewish, anti-communist nationalism to the entire world. His creedcaptured the collective mind of Germany which tuned to the thoughtwaves of fascism until it was hypnotised and controlled by therantings of this misguided man. He had increased his standingbefore his election by having his Gestapo4n-waiting burn down theGerman Parliament building, the Reichstag, in 1933, for which heblamed the communists. He also used the fear of the Russians togreat effect. In this he was helped by the Pope who spread hatred ofCommunist Russia at every opportunity. The churches had beenmortified when Lenin’s revolution banned religion. They didn’tknow they had been double-crossed by the same Brotherhood theybelieved was supporting them.Two other secret societies which played a part in the Nazirevolution were the Vril Society and the Edelweiss Society. Like theThules, they had links with their brethren in Britain. Rudolph Hessand Heinrich Himmler were both ‘Vrils’ - Himmler was to head theappalling Nazi Gestapo and SS. Hermann Goering was a member ofthe Edelweiss Society and believed that Hitler was the NordicMessiah he was convinced was expected.

Any literature advocating freedom of any kind wasdestroyed, and promises he made to the socialists and monarchistswho helped to elect him were forgotten. There would be no moreelections. The Fuhrer would be obeyed. Around him he gathered hisprinciple officers like Goebbels, Ribbentrop, Goering, and Himmler.They would rule Germany by terror, and millions of Jews would bemurdered in the gas chambers and concentration camps. Ribbentropwas to have several cosy conversations with the Pope aboutGermany’s expansion plans, although the main agent of the secretVatican-Germany-America alliance was Rudolph Hess.So now there were dictators in Italy, Germany, and Russia, whereJoseph Stalin had succeeded Lenin in 1924. Soon there would beanother in Spain. In 1936 General Franco, a Roman Catholicextremist, led a revolt against the Spanish Republican Governmentwhich had reduced the power of the Church since the days when itcontrolled everything. The Spanish Civil War was a prelude to thenext World conflict, with Germany and Italy lining up behind Franco,while Britain, France, and Russia supported the republicans.Tragically for the Spanish people, Franco’s armies won, and he didfor the Roman Catholic Church in Spain what Mussolini had done inItaly. It was given back its wealth and lands, received large annualpayments from the state, and the education system was back in itscontrol. Religious paraphernalia was everywhere and the inquisitionreturned. The Papal flag was flown by Franco as he overturnedSpanish democracy and his flag was proudly flown at the Vatican.The Pope’s role in this victory over democracy had been crucial. Hehad appealed to Roman Catholics all over Europe to go to Spain andfight in this ‘Holy War’.When Hitler began his expansionism into Austria, the RomanCatholic bishops there told the people to be loyal to the Nazis and aswastika was flown from the tower of Vienna Cathedral. Hitlerenjoyed Roman Catholic support also in his conquest ofCzechoslovakia. Pope Pius XI and his successor, Pius XII, wantedmore than anything for Germany to overthrow Communism inRussia. Little did they know that Germany had played a vital part increating communism! The story of Vatican support for the fascists isquite disgraceful, although not surprising given its history; so is that"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"169of the Brotherhood industrialists and bankers who were supportingboth sides. By now there were Brotherhood organisationscoordinating the elite bankers and industrial combines across theworld. One was the Bank for International Settlements that wasbeyond democratic control. Among the financial backers of theNazis were the German chemical giant I. G. Farben, among whosedirectors were Max and Paul Warburg who ran banks in bothGermany and the United States. The Warburgs were instrumental instarting the American Federal Reserve Bank and you’ll recall thatMax Warburg was mentioned earlier as a source of funds for Leninand the communist revolution in Russia! The Bank of Manhattanwas a Warburg bank, and one of its directors, H.A.Metz, was fromI.G.Farben, which had been a cartel partner of the RockefellerCorporation’s Standard Oil Company, before the war as part of theBrotherhood’s banking and industrial network. Standard Oilsupplied the Nazis during the war through Switzerland, and AveryRockefeller had set up a company which combined their interestswith Schroeder, Hitler’s personal bank. C. E. Mitchell, a director ofFarben’s American arm, was also a director of the Federal Reserve,and the network was now so tightly knit you could hardly see thejoin. Farben gave extra funding to Himmler’s SS, and so did theGerman subsidiaries of the American corporations, I.T.T andGeneral Electric. General Motors supplied both sides in the war, asdid the European subsidiaries of the US banks, with the blessing ofheadquarters. Ball bearings, which the allies were short of; wereshipped to the Nazis via South America by the Vice-Chairman of theAmerican War Productions Board. Farben ran the factoriesconnected to the concentrations camps to take advantage of the,literally, slave labour they offered, and the same company producedthe gas that killed the victims of Auschwitz and the hundreds ofother extermination centres. I. G. Farben still continues to operatetoday under various names. *The Brotherhood network in Britain supported the Nazis - and stilldoes - and the Bank of England helped Hitler. Its director, MontagueNorman, who was a ‘Mr. Big’ of the world banking network, met inthe Spring of 1934 with other British businessmen at the bank’s*The drug companies, A.G.

Farben offshoots."},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"170headquarters in Threadneedle Street, and it appears they agreed togive Hitler secret funding, while Norman tried to persuade theBritish government to remove their support for France and transferit to Germany. Even after Hitler had begun his killing tour ofEurope, the Bank of England released to him six million pounds ofCzechoslovak reserves held in London after he had invaded thatcountry. All through the war the Brotherhood companies and banksin Allied countries were covertly funding both sides, which includedsupport for Mussolini when his regime got into financial difficulties.It made them a fortune, something that was increased athousandfold by the need to rebuild a shattered world. It alsomaintained the yoke of suffering and ignorance on the population.The Bank of England was nationalised by the new LabourGovernment in 1946, but it still has a massive influence on Britain 5economic policies and I expect it to start demanding moreindependence from government.Hitler ignored all agreements made by Germany in the Treaty ofVersailles after their defeat in the First World War. He assembled avast army, navy and air force, and the rest of Europe feared theworst. After Hitler’s invasion of Austria, the British Prime Minister,Neville Chamberlain, flew to meet him in Munich in 1938 and camehome with his famous agreement signed by Hitler, whichChamberlain claimed would mean ‘peace in our times’.Chamberlain was a genuine man who only wanted peace for hispeople, but Hitler had other ideas. When Germany invaded Polandin 1939 Britain and France declared war. Poland was now againunder foreign rule after a brief independence, during which theRoman Catholic majority had persecuted the Eastern orthodoxChristians in their midst. After the war Poland was absorbed into theSoviet Union until that empire collapsed in 1991. The Poles thenhanded over their independence to the Roman Catholic Churchwhich today, effectively, runs the country. If anyone thinks theRoman Catholic Church has really moved on, they should see howquickly it has taken control of Poland once the opportunitypresented itself.Hitler captured France, Belgium and the Netherlands, but chose notto attack Britain when we were in disarray at home. WinstonChurchill had replaced Chamberlain, but Britain was not prepared forwar. Had Hitler attacked then he would almost certainly havecaptured the British Isles quite easily. Why did he not attack when"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"171Britain was clearly there for the taking? Maybe it wasn’t part of thegame plan? The evacuation of British troops from Dunkirk in thearmada of little boats in 1940 was a marvellous achievement, but if theGerman commanders had wanted to stop it, they could have. Whydidn’t they? Instead of invading Britain, Hitler turned his mind toRussia which suffered fantastic losses in the defence of their land, andagain it was the courage and commitment of a manipulated people thatweakened the German forces and delayed their plans. The conflictspread to North Africa where the Allies confronted German and Italiantroops under Rommel. It was Rommel’s ultimate defeat at El Alamein,and the Soviets’ extraordinary defeat of the Germans in the East, whichended a series of German victories and the tide began to turn the flowthe way of the Allies. But the big change came when the United Statesentered the war in 1941. She had already been supporting the Allieswith supplies and arms when the Japanese attacked the American fleetat Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. This brought the US into the war - exactlyas it was meant to. This was the Lusitania mark II.The story behind that Japanese attack goes back a long way. TheJapanese, like the Chinese, are of the Mongol race. Both countrieshave a history of civil war and unrest. The Japanese main religion isShintoism and they too were enamoured by secret societies. The mostdominant one had a Black Dragon symbol. They believed theirEmperor to be Divine, and themselves to be descended from thegods, a chosen people descended from extra-terrestrials. All effortsby Christian missionaries to convert them failed, and in the 17thcentury the behaviour of the missionaries towards them was soappalling that they closed their country to all Europeans for twohundred years. In the second half of the 19th century, steamshipsfrom the United States arrived and refused to be turned away. Japanwas attacked by a combination of the Americans, British, Dutch, andFrench until they were forced to open their ports. The Japanesebecame a people transformed in the decades that followed. They usedthe weapons provided by the Christian world to attack and defeatChina in 1894, and Russia in 1905. She also entered the First WorldWar against Germany.Between 1937 and 1939 she took over most of China, which was inthe midst of constant insurrection against the stream of emperors andpresidential dictators thrust upon them. Modern China’s story is ofdiabolical exploitation by the colonial powers, with the British tryingto get the Chinese addicted to the drug opium for purposes of trade"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"172and control. In the run up to Pearl Harbor, the British and Americanshad been trying to stop Japan overthrowing the Chinese EmperorChiang Kai-shek, and the Japanese resented this. They were givenevery encouragement to enter the war, and I believe that WinstonChurchill knew all about it, as did his fellow freemason, PresidentFranklin D Roosevelt. Churchill would later say privately of this timethat Roosevelt.... “Said he would wage war, but not declare it (and) thathe would become more and more provocative everything was beingdone to force an ‘incident’ that could lead the United States into warIn the US Senate in 1939, Senator Gerald P.Nye of North Dakotaannounced that he had seen a series of volumes called The Next War.One of them was entitled Propaganda In The Next War. He said thewriter of that book was a Sidney Rogerson, whom he could not trace.But he knew that the editor-in-chief of the series was Captain LiddellHart who was a writer and military authority in Europe withconnections to the London Times. The work Propaganda In The NextWar had, he said, included the following analysis of the backgroundto World War I:“For some time the issue as to which side the United States wouldtake hung in the balance, the final result was a credit to our Britishpropaganda. There remain the Jews. It has been estimated that of theworld Jew population of approximately fifteen million, no fewer thanfive million are in the United States; 25% of the inhabitants of NewYork are Jews.During the Great War we bought off this huge American Jewishpublic by the promise of the Jewish national home in Palestine, heldby Ludendorf to be a master stroke of allied propaganda, as itenabled us not only to appeal to Jews in America, but to Jews inGermany as well.”The Americans entered the First World War in 1917, and onNovember 6th of that year came the famous Balfour Declaration,when the British Government announced the recognition of Palestineas a national homeland for the Jews. It is important to note that LordBalfour was closely linked with the Round Table Group. Thedreadful events in Israel in recent years are the result of Britainnegotiating away Palestine to get the United States to enter the FirstWorld War and to further Brotherhood ambitions. But how could theAmerican public be persuaded to support Britain in the next war,"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"173which this propaganda report clearly knew was inevitable?“To persuade her [the United States] to take our part will be muchmore difficult, so difficult as to be unlikely to succeed. It will need adefinite threat to America, a threat, moreover, which will have to bebrought home by propaganda to every citizen, before the republic willagain take arms in an external quarrel...“The position will naturally be considerably eased if Japan wereinvolved, and this might and probably would bring America inwithout further ado. At any rate, it would be a natural and obviouseffect of our propagandists to achieve this, just as in the Great Warthey succeeded in embroiling the United States with Germany.“Fortunately with America, our propaganda is on firm ground. Wecan be entirely sincere, as our main plank will be the old democraticone. We must clearly enunciate our belief in the democratic form ofgovernment, and our firm resolve to adhere to.... the old goddess ofdemocracy routine.”The main themes of wars are known and planned in advance. It is clearfrom evidence that has emerged since the war that President FranklinD Roosevelt knew at least forty-eight hours before the attack on PearlHarbor that the Japanese were going to strike. He did nothing to warnhis sailors and the people of Hawaii, because he wanted the Americanpublic to be so outraged that they would agree to enter the war inEurope. That is exactly what happened, just as the prewarpropagandists had planned. The method of goading the Japanese camefrom the Brotherhood’s Council on Foreign Relations, the Round Tablecreation. The Council’s War and Peace Studies Project sent a memo toRoosevelt suggesting that aid be sent to China, and that he strangleJapanese trade by freezing their US assets, imposing a trade embargoon Japan, and refusing them the use of the Panama Canal. This he did,and Roosevelt and the Brotherhood were rewarded with the Japaneseattack on Pearl Harbor. Roosevelt was a pawn of the Brotherhood inthe form of the Council on Foreign Relations. Much of his cabinetcame from there and his son-in-law, Curtis Dall, quoted in Jim Keith’sCasebook on Alternative Three, said:“For a long time I felt that (Roosevelt)... had developed manythoughts and ideas that were his own to benefit this country, the USA.But he didn’t.

I am not saying that they are ‘bad’ people - just pawns.The war was now truly global with fronts in Europe, the Middle East,and the Far East, as the Japanese occupied the Allied colonies likeMalaya, Singapore, the Philippines, Borneo, Hong Kong and Burma.The men, women and children who were caught in those countrieswhen the Japanese invaded were subjected to unbelievable torture andatrocities. But then it is no good one country being holier than anotherin its version of history. Every country on the planet has shown itselfcapable of crimes against humanity. The British authorities reeled backin horror at the concentration camps in Germany, but it was the Britishwho started the idea with their camps created by Lord Kitchener, inwhich 26,000 prisoners died in South Africa during the Boer War. Andthe allies were fighting alongside the Russian regime who wererunning concentration camps for their own people and slaughteringmillions in other ways. Every continent was involved in the war, andthe soldiers of Australia and New Zealand once again supported theAllied cause. Even with the support of America and the other Englishspeaking peoples, the fascists were defeated only through horrendousloss of life on both sides. With the fascist armies overcome in NorthAfrica the push began northwards into Italy in 1943. The Fascist GrandCouncil restored King Victor Emmanuel as ruler, and Mussolini wasforced to resign. The Italian Parliament was reconvened under the newPrime Minister, Marshall Pietro Badogho. He first told Hitler he wouldcontinue the fight, but then made a peace pact with the Allies.Mussolini tried to escape to Switzerland with his mistress, but theywere killed by Communist partisans and their corpses held up forridicule and public display in Milan.The Germans tried to hold back the Allied advance through Italy,but in the end their defences were breached.

With great courage and enormous loss of life, they pushed onacross France to liberate Paris and occupy Western Germany, while theRussians advanced in Eastern Europe. The war in Europe was over, butallies who had been united against a common enemy were about tobecome extremely hostile to each other in what passed for peace. WithGermany on the retreat, the latter weeks of the war became a race forBerlin between the western armies and the Russians. Both wanted to bein the best possible negotiating position for the division of land whenthe conflict was over. The Russians would spread their Communist(state fascist) creed to form the Empire of the Soviet Union andencompass Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Rumania,Poland, and the eastern part of Germany. Under US influence a wallwas built to divide Berlin between capitalist and communist and thosein the East who tried to reach the West were shot by their own army.Families were divided by the whims of the Communist dictator, JosephStalin, and his underlings and successors who would now murdermillions of their own people in this ‘workers’ paradise’.The defeat of Germany did not end the war entirely. Japan still heldout and Roosevelt’s successor, Harry S.Truman, another freemason,gave the order to drop the atom bomb which had been developedduring the war years. An arm of the Illuminati’s Round Table, theInstitute for Advanced Study at Princeton University, New Jersey, gavevital support to those who were developing the bomb. One of itsmembers was Robert Oppenheimer, the leading light in the creation ofthe bomb, and Albert Einstein also regularly used the Institute. It haslong been a front for the advancement of Brotherhood science whichthe public has no idea about, but which is usually between 50 and 100years ahead of ‘public’ science.

He and his lady Eva Braun did not die in the bunker,as history urges us to believe. At least some of them went to SouthAmerica. From the views and evidence I have heard and seen, Ibelieve that Hitler was flown out of Germany by the famous Germanaviator, Hans Bauer. He flew Nazi wealth and personnel out ofBerlin, and Hitler would have had no trouble getting away to a quietairfield, because when the Russians arrived in Berlin, they foundbehind the bookcase in Hitler’s room a secret passage leading to anunderground tunnel with its own trolley railway line. The dentalrecords of Hitler and the corpse said to be Hitler did not match and itis most likely to have been the body of his driver, Julius Schreck, aHitler fanatic, who looked like him and acted as his ‘double’ onseveral occasions. A Russian statement in 1945 said:“No trace of the bodies of Hitler or Eva Braun has beendiscovered.... It is established that Hitler, by means of false testimony,sought to hide his traces.

The scale ofthis struck me on a trip to France with my family in 1993 when westayed in a house between Caen and Falaise in Normandy. Falaise isthe birthplace of William the Conquerer. It was a lovely area, but youcould feel something unpleasant in the atmosphere. I knew that theD-Day Landings had taken place on the coast a short drive awayfrom where we were staying, but it was only when we were leavingfor home that I realised we had been living near the scene of a bloodycarnage in 1944. The Battle of the Falaise Gap was, in the words ofEisenhower: ‘One of the biggest slaughter fields a war sector everknew’. More than 650,000 people were killed or wounded.When thought patterns are broadcast by people, they stay in thatarea until they are balanced by other patterns. The spirits of the deadare often still there, too. The confusion and pain of the experiencecan prevent them from getting back to their ‘home’ frequency. Wecall them ‘ghosts’ or ‘lost souls’. When you go to the scene of battlesit can feel ‘eerie’. These are the thought patterns of fear, horror,aggression, and pain that were created by those involved. Sensitivepeople who go to such places can hear battles or see them happening.They are tuning into these thought waves. We could feel them in thatarea of Normandy.

Then one night she was awake and she looked acrossat Gareth who was sleeping in our room, because he was sofrightened. Hovering above him she saw a dark cloud of energy. Shewatched as the cloud swept across the room and out through the door.The next morning she told me the story and she didn’t know that Iwoke up that night and felt a very strange and unpleasantatmosphere. After the experience, the atmosphere in the housechanged and the attic door never came open again. Gareth’s feardisappeared, too. If you imagine that I am talking of the effects onthe energy field of one battle in one war, you can see why thenegative imbalance has progressed so quickly across the planet. Butequally it can be removed just as quickly if we change the way wethink.We are involved in a spiritual struggle between harmony anddisharmony. The Luciferic consciousness manipulates extra-terrestrials and human behaviour by firing thought patterns into theirindividual and collective consciousness. These patterns are designedto distort the mental and, especially, emotional levels of our being.This has the effect of closing down the flow of energies, knowledge,and enlightenment between higher and lower selves. This flow hasfurther been affected since the dawn of the Industrial Revolutionwhich has turned many humans into physical as well as mentalrobots, and caused severe mental and emotional stress.In some ways human consciousness has come a long way over theperiod covered in this book, but in others it has hardly progressed atall. We are now facing the Days of Decision when, on this densephysical level, we evolve and rebel or we perish. That is the choicethat now faces us all."},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"17911Big is Beautiful?The Industrial Revolution began in Britain in the 18th century withthe invention of the steam engine, and within a hundred years thisrevolution would fill the skies with black smoke and pollution, rapethe planet for fuels, and turn millions, eventually billions, into robots;mere extensions of a factory machine.The poor and the weak have always been exploited by thelandowners or whoever had the financial and physical power of theday. But now it was to be done on a massive, ultimately global scale,as the Brotherhood spread its economic culture across the world. Thepeople came in from the countryside, and filthy urban sprawlsappeared around the mills and the factories. They worked long hoursoften for starvation wages, and the system I have termed ‘take, make,and throwaway’ had arrived. Its Pied Piper was the obsession withthe pursuit of economic growth -producing more, consuming more,and throwing away more, every year. But actually playing the tunewas the Brotherhood network of bankers and their frontorganisations, the so called ‘think tanks’.A new religion was born. It was called ‘science’. Christianity wasstill powerful, but its influence was now in terminal decline.Suddenly the scientist was God. This science created the machine ageand all the potions and poisons that have taken human life, quitepossibly, to the brink of non-existence. But as the 19th centurypassed to the 20th, this new culture and new God had hypnotisedmuch of human consciousness. Science, or what passes for it,decided that life after physical death was a myth. Everything couldbe explained by the ‘logic’ of science. Basically we were all a cosmicaccident, the product of the random interaction of chemicals, atoms,and the like. This gave Christianity some serious problems, but itgave the human race even more. Not least was the growing belief thatlife was pointless. The idea was that ‘life’s a bitch and then you die’."},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"180The lives people were being forced to endure in the blackened townsand cities appeared to confirm that this was the case. It was anotherdrain on a human spirit already crushed by the robotic demands ofthe machine age.Christianity’s ability to stop the haemorrhage of support in the faceof scientific ‘evidence’ was not helped by the obvious nonsense of itsdogmatic, unyielding, claims for the Bible to be literally true. It wasnow beginning to reap the consequences of refusing to budge fromthe dogma decided at Nicaea and in the centuries that immediatelyfollowed. But as I said in a previous chapter, the view of life andCreation outlined in this book and others, was now suppressed notonly by Christianity as it had been for nearly 2,000 years, but also by‘science’. Christianity and ‘science’ may have appeared to be inconflict, but they had a mutual interest which was essential to thesurvival of both. That was to ensure that as few people as possiblebelieved that consciousness was eternal in everyone, and that ourconsciousness reincarnates into countless physical bodies on itsjourney of evolution through experience. The acceptance of that bythe population would mean goodbye to Christianity and most otherreligions, and goodbye to the whole basis of scientific ‘thinking’.One of the Brotherhood’s most effective tools is to makeorganisations dependent for their very survival on the suppression ofknowledge.The result of this was a world created by the five physical senseswhich pandered only to those senses. God was dead and the idea ofspirit was a primitive illusion. Materialism had arrived with avengeance. Our culture was built by material senses for materialsenses. Such a process could not have created any other kind ofworld than the one we see today. The higher levels of humans weredismissed by ‘science’ as not even existing and the only high-profilealternative, Christianity and its religious soul-mates around theWorld, were leaking credibility with every passing year, thanks to thetime-warp in which they are imprisoned. This left a spiritual vacuumwhich is only now being filled as an understanding of who we arebegins to re-emerge in our consciousness. The material-cosmic-accident view so took over this new religion called science, that evenwhen members of its own profession challenged this belief; theywere ridiculed, outcast, or ignored.

Nearly every true scientist"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"181who has taken human understanding forward has faced that kind ofreaction and opposition. ‘Science’ became obsessed with the physicallevel and concentrated its mind on discovering the secrets andpotential of the physical world, at the expense of seeking thosehigher levels where the answers really lie. Almost from the start,‘science’ has been serving the system and the Brotherhood byhelping to imprison the human race. In doing that, the new religionhas merely followed the pattern of the old.The whole system was founded and underpinned at every turn byexploitation. Exploitation of the planet; of the human robots in themines and factories; and of the people in what we now call the ThirdWorld. Most of these ‘under-developed’ countries were then underthe occupation and control of Britain and other European Countries.Countries like Britain could not lose at this stage. It had thetechnology, primitive as it was, and it had the British Empire. It couldtake the natural ‘resources’ from the countries it controlled, turnthose resources into products, and sell them back at a profit. Thisglobal exploitation by the strong at the expense of the weak woulddestroy the cultures of Third World countries and take away theirself-sufficiency in food. This was vital for the exploitation tocontinue. When these countries eventually rebelled against physicaloccupation, Europe and the United States had toreplace that with other forms of control. They achieved this by \\\\replacing physical occupation with financial occupation. Theymade poorer countries dependent on the industrialised world fortheir food and finance. The American senator, Hubert Humphrey, putit like this:“I have heard that people may become dependent on us for food. Iknow that was not supposed to be good news. To me that was goodnews, because before people can do anything they have to eat. And ifyou are looking for a way to get people to lean on you and to bedependent on you, in terms of their cooperation with you, it seems tome that food dependency would be terrific.”Exactly. This motivation would lead to the famine and starvation ofthe 20th century.

I go into all this insome detail in my book, It Doesn’t Have To Be Like This. It is all partof the long term Brotherhood plan:“We are interested in the . . . . killing out of the Goyim.

Every single day.But why should we be surprised at this? How could it be any otherway when you have an economic system that depends for its survival,let alone its success, on taking, making, and throwing away moreevery year to worship at the Brotherhood altar of economic growth?It is the ultimate conveyor belt to global suicide. The stark truth isthat if you need to consume more every year, the human andenvironmental effects are both enormous and eventually fatal. Eitherthe Brotherhood elite are incredibly stupid, or they have lost controlof their creation, or they have other motives for what they are doingto the planet. I suspect the latter. Here is a summary of why it hastaken the human race little more than two hundred years to go fromthe dawn of the Industrial Revolution to the mess and mayhem wesee today - and why it has so massively served Brotherhood interests:(1) If you have constantly to produce more and consume more, yousoon pass the point where that can continue within your own borders.You have to sell abroad and export your culture. You have to changethe way others live and impose your evolution upon them. You dothis by making them dependent on you and by selling your culturethrough manipulative advertising. If you have an addictive product,like cigarettes, so much the better, because once people are hookedyou have a captive market. And once you have other countriesaddicted to the pursuit of your culture, you have even more power tomake them use their resources and land to supply you with what youneed to supply them with finished products at a handsome profit. Bynow you have destroyed their self-sufficiency in food, and you canclaim that the developed world is helping the underdeveloped worldout of the goodness of its heart, and the success of its culture by‘giving’ food to them when millions are starving, because they can nolonger produce food for themselves. Even then you only respondwith as little as you can get away with in situations that are eitherwell publicised or suit your desire to make others do your will. Assomeone once said: ‘When you have got someone by the balls, theirhearts and minds will follow’. They might just as easily have said‘stomachs’. The need to expand production and sales each year"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"184means that everyone has to compete with everyone else. For everywinner there have to be losers, often dead ones. The one exception tothat is the banking elite. They can’t lose. We talk of the desire forcooperation in the world, and yet the very foundation of theeconomic ethos is to turn person against person, family againstfamily, town against town, country against country, and trading blocagainst trading bloc in brutal competition, while the elite share thespoils between themselves.“In order to give the Goyim no time to think and take note, theirminds must be diverted towards industry and trade. Thus, all thenations will be swallowed up in the pursuit of gain and in the race forit will not take note of their common foe. But, again, in order thatfreedom may once for all disintegrate and ruin the communities of theGoyim, we must put industry on a speculative basis; the result of thiswill be that what is withdrawn from the land by industry will slipthrough the hands and pass into speculation, that is, to our classes.”(Protocol 4).(2) It is vital that you also make your own population dependent fortheir food and existence on the same system. If they have alternatives,they cannot be forced to do your will or stand by a factory machinemost of their waking hours. The effect of this is to diminish their spiritand grind down their resistance to any propaganda that you feed tothem through a compliant and systemserving media. The need forexpanding the system requires that your scientific’ research is gearedto inventing new things that you can persuade people to buy; to findingcheaper ways of making those things through technology; and toinventing new weapons of mass destruction. As with video recorders,so with guided missiles. If you can constantly advance the technologyof whatever you produce, people and countries will constantly‘update’. In short, they will keep buying the same thing again andagain as perfectly adequate ‘products are systematically madetechnologically ‘obsolete’. These twin aims of product and weaponadvancement to serve the economic system is what science has largelybeen about. Serving humanity and seeking truth has been a strictlysecondary motivation for the scientific Brotherhood-manipulatedestablishment. The weaponry is also important to protect the wealth ofthe powerful, and to increase that wealth when it becomeseconomically desirable for a war in which you can supply both sides."},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"185(3) This system is so obviously destructive and stupid that if youallowed people to be shown in its true nature, they would soon seethe obvious. Christianity feared and vehemently opposed educationfor the masses because of the possible consequences of people seeingthat creed for the silliness which most of it is. But they need not haveworried. The system had no intention of educating people, especiallythe young. It wishes to indoctrinate, not educate, and that is what ithas done. ‘Education’ is there to turn out fodder for the system. Itsaim is to persuade people to see things its way and reject any ideathat there could possibly be an alternative. What could be better forthe system than to take children away from their homes on most daysduring their formative years, and feed them whatever they need tobelieve to become the next generation of robots? It is quite happy togive Christianity a good mention up to a point because that is nothreat to anything except itself and human understanding. As we haveseen both the System and Christianity have a big stake in holdingback human understanding, anyway. Further afield, where there arenative peoples who have not been subjected to this economic mindcontrol, you take away their forests, lands, and way of life either byforce or through Christianisation. With their culture destroyed, theybecome dependent and often seek to escape from the nightmarethrough alcohol or drugs. Your control of the world is extended byenvironmental destruction.(4) The need to produce and sell more every year means that thepoint quickly arrives when people can no longer increase productionby themselves. You build machines which turn out more productswith fewer people. As production needs to constantly increase, themachines have to get bigger and require ever fewer people.Unemployment grows. The way the system responds to this is in theonly way it knows how: by fiddling the unemployment figures tohide how bad things really are; by starting wars; and by increasingthe number of things that people want by manipulating the symbolsof human success so they all relate to posses sions. You need to makepeople dissatisfied with whatever they have and to seek happinessthrough the accumulation of material ‘things’. This however meansthat your production must follow the money because poor peoplecan’t buy. Therefore production is increasingly geared to the wants ofthe well-off minority, and away from the needs of the poor majority.This leads to some people having every possession they could"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"186possibly desire, while others sleep in cardboard boxes in the street.Look how the system has manipulated Christmas. Christianityrecycled a pagan mid-winter festival quite erroneously into thebirthday ofJesus and the system has recycled that into an orgy ofconsumption. We speak of having a ‘traditional Christmas’, whenmost of the traditions have only been here since the start of theIndustrial Revolution. What should be a lovely time of rest,enjoyment, and a gathering together of friends and family, hasbecome a nightmare for millions. Children are bombarded withtelevision advertisements for expensive toys, and their parents oftenborrow money they cannot afford because they don’t want todisappointment them on Christmas Day. They either struggle throughthe next year paying off the debt, or they spend Christmas feelingguilty for not providing what their children have been conditioned towant. This exploitation of emotions becomes more desperate andexplicit every year because the Christmas spending boom is nowessential to the survival of many shops and factories.The difference between the ‘haves’ and ‘have nots’ comes down tothe number of pieces of paper they possess. This mostly has nothingwhatsoever to do with their abilities or their desire to contribute tothe well-being of society. You can be a financial ‘winner’ and earnlots of bits of paper by making some plastic claptrap that is no realuse to anyone. But you can be a financial loser by dedicating yourlife to the care of others. What you sell is what matters, not what youcontribute to humanity. As we have seen the easiest way to makemoney is to create it out of nothing. Values and desires becomedistorted by this and societies become sick and more divided.Another implication of this annual expansion is that, as productionbecomes more mechanised, the investment necessary to compete getsgreater and the small fall by the wayside. Big becomes beautiful andlife becomes ugly. The economic power gathers in fewer and fewerhands in line with the Brotherhood plan and the major corporationsand banks call the shots far more than elected politicians.(5) The mopping up of unemployment by the expansion of ‘wants’can only go on for so long. Through this century, and particularlysince the sixties and seventies, the so-called ‘Third World’ has startedto produce more finished products. The system that started withBritain exploiting its empire for ‘resources’ and selling them back thefinished products has changed dramatically. The whole of Europe and"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"187then the United States followed and expanded what Britain hadstarted. In the second half of this century, the Far East, Asia, Africa,and South America, were sold the Industrial Dream, often by bankswho wished to invest the money that was pouring in, especially fromArab countries after the Brotherhood-engineered oil price surge ofthe 1970s. The World has become awash with products looking forpeople to buy them.(6) At the same time there are fewer people with the money to buythose products. Once a large number of countries have the sameambition - to produce more and sell more and they pass the pointwhere this can continue within their own borders, everyone has tocompete with everyone else for sales all over the world. Thisbecomes a battle to the economic and, for at least 100,000 peopleevery day, the physical death. More automation is required toproduce more products at a lower cost because everyone has tocompete to find ways of making the same product cheaper. Moreautomation means less employment, and less money in people’spockets to buy the products the machines are making. The majormanufacturers begin to transfer much of their production to ThirdWorld countries because the laws on exploitation there are even morelax than in the West, and you can pay people a fraction of the wagesdemanded in Europe and America.(7) As a result of all this, the system is now in desperate trouble andthat is precisely what the banking elite want to justify their next step,a centralised world economy, based on a World Central Bank. Whilesome unemployment is seen as good for the system because it helpsto keep those employed subservient through fear of losing their job,there comes a stage where it is dangerous. This happens when thenumbers without ajob, and with no prospect of getting one, reachuncontrollable proportions. The amount of money being produced bydeclining sales is no longer sufficient to pay the welfare benefits ofthose increasing numbers who are no longer employed and the socialneeds of the victims the system spits out when they are no longer anyuse to it. The system is so crazy that to survive it needs more andmore people to buy each year, but fewer and fewer people to makewhat they buy. It cannot have both, but it needs both.

Whenyou force people to work in a soulless, mindless, system, this canhave severe mental and emotional affects. Our hearts desire freedom,love, and joy. Our inner self wants to be positive, creative, and tap allthe endless potential that we all have, and I mean all. But the systemdemands that we are little more than the extension of technology andexpendable whenever technology can be created to replace us. To thesystem we are not people or spiritual beings, we are units ofproduction and consumption. You will even note that we are nowreferred to by the stewards of the system, the politicians, economists,and industrialists, as ‘consumers’ because that is how it sees us. Thissystem without a soul has created an explosion in other expressionsof consumption such as alcohol and drugs. These are ways thatpeople try to escape from the nightmare and the agony their innerselves are suffering. They may not even be aware that they arefeeling like this at a deeper level. But it will still manifest in drugsand other forms of temporary escape from the realities of this madworld.

Is it any wonder that you see defeat in so manyfaces. The system, science, and religion have combined to makebillions tired of living, but scared of dying.Crime is another consequence.

In this state of mind some will mug an old lady for a fewpounds or dollars without a thought for what they have done to her.Their motto will be: ‘the system has no respect for me, so whyshould I have any respect for anyone else? It’s everyone forthemselves’.But hold on a second. If your agenda involves the introduction ofan ever more authoritarian police force, military and legal system,what do you need more than anything to carry public opinion withyou? More crime, the more violent and horrible the better.In a system in which the possession of pieces of paper is the onlyway you can enjoy food, shelter, and warmth, you are faced withincreasing numbers of people made redundant by technology andrecession who are hungry, homeless and cold. There are also thosewho are disabled, elderly and infirm, or unable to work for otherreasons. These, too, are denied the means to earn pieces of paper. TheSystem reacts to this in a variety of ways. In some countries itignores such people and suppresses wholesale rebellion bystrengthening the police force and the army and by making those inwork fearful of speaking out against this cruelty and losing their job.Elsewhere, governments pay these victims of the system as little asthey can get away with, though in a few more enlightened countriesthey are more generous. But all use the weapon of fear to control thepopulation and prevent serious rebellion.Every year the System is faced with bigger bills for crime, policing,medical services, welfare benefits, and all the rest. This is aninevitable consequence of take, make and throwaway, and all thatgoes with it. And how does the system and its mind controlledpoliticians react to this? To say we must have a greater expansion ofproduction and consumption to raise more money by creating moregrowth. This ‘policy’ spews out yet more victims and demands, yetmore resources are spent on crime, police, medical services, andwelfare benefits.

As Mark Twainsaid: ‘If you’re only tool is a hammer, all problems look like nails’.(9) The demands of the system and its de-humanisation of peoplehas led to the exploitation of other life forms. I have heard it said thatanimal rights campaigners should think more about cruelty to peoplethan animals. This misses the point. Cruelty is cruelty. Any societythat will justify the appalling treatment of animals that goes on todaywill have no qualms about being cruel to people. Animals, likepeople, have become another commodity, another form ofthroughput. We perform experiments on them which make the worstexcesses of the Nazis seem like kindness itsel£ We have the horrorsof the slaughter houses and food factories. 500 million chickens inBritain are forced to live out their wretched lives standing on wiremess in tiny cages with hardly enough room to sit down. They areegg-throughput machines. Around 40 million little chicks are killedin Britain every year within hours of their birth for the ‘crime’ ofbeing male. They are from a species genetically developed for egglaying. The males cannot lay eggs and so they cannot live. Everyweek in British slaughter houses we murder 8 million chickens,300,000 pigs, 80,000 cattle, 500,000 turkeys, 50,000 rabbits, and300,000 sheep in conditions of dreadful cruelty and barbarism. As thesaying goes: If slaughterhouse walls were made of glass, we’d all bevegetarians. Only a human race de4inked from its true self andcontrolled by a consciousness that wishes to destroy our compassionand inner goodness would allow this to happen. There is a BritishCabinet Minister and outspoken Christian dogmatist who hasridiculed vegetarians at every opportunity. “If God had wanted us tobe vegetarians”, he said, “He would have given us three stomachs.”In reply you could say that if God had wanted us to talk such baloneyHe/She would not have given us a brain.(10) To hide the realities of the system and its corruption you need‘Security Services and other organisations dedicated to secrecy. It isclaimed that they are required to keep an eye on potential threatsfrom other countries and terrorist groups and to safeguard nationalsecurity, but as we have seen the main aim of governments and thesecrecy services is to keep truth from their own people.

Truth to the system is like garlic to avampire. The security services spend more time spying on thosepeacefully challenging the status quo than they do on potentialterrorists. They know and manipulate the terrorists, anyway, andindeed engage in terrorism themselves. All sorts of underhandmanoeuvring goes on to stop any individual or group which they fearmay be vehicles for effectively challenging the system. Frame-ups,phone taps, agents provocateur, even murder; all these methods areused by the state and the global Brotherhood and its representativesto stop those who present a threat to their continuing control.(11) Into all that I have said, another fundamental limitation on thesystem’s further expansion must be added. It is the most importantfactor of all. If you demand that every year you consume more, youdismantle the planet on which we all depend. Even the land is treatedlike a factory floor. It has been so exploited with chemicals tomaximise short term production that its ability to go on producing isbeing reduced every year. If you had a machine that produced theessentials of human survival and it was the only machine of its kindthat existed, what would people say if you took a sledgehammer tothis machine and bashed it into tiny pieces? People would say youwere bonkers, crazy, mad, many sandwiches short of a picnic. Wellthat is exactly what the human race is doing to the planet. Every yearthrough this Industrial Revolution we have taken more ‘resources’from the Earth and turned them into more pollution in the name of‘progress.’ In doing this, the system has had to increase the numberof products that are disposable and thrown away as soon as possibleafter purchase. Only in this way can you increase production. Youcan’t do it if you make things to last. This economic necessity underthe rules of the system has given us the disposable cup, knife, fork,plate, razor, etc, and the ever-increasing amount of throwawaypackaging. Something that is used once and thrown away is anorgasmic experience for the system; anything that is made to last aslong as possible is potentially fatal. As I have said, the United Statesis on the front line of this suicide, but most of the world is involvedalso. We have created such a monster that the more successful it is inits own terms, the quicker it destroys the planet. But we still havepoliticians talking of the need to return to full employment.

And in a world in which the ‘norm’ is tolaugh at the idea of UFOs and extra-terrestrials, you are beingpresented with a view that suggests that far from not existing, ETs ofboth positive and negative intent have been a fundamental influenceon human affairs.Perhaps most difficult of all to accept is that a brotherhood was setup thousands of years ago to initiate an elite into the spiritual ‘truths’,while twisting those truths enough to con the initiates intomanipulating everyone else; and that today this same brotherhood hasprogressed to the point where it controls most of the world’s political,economic and secret service activity. From the perspective of lifewhich the system encourages to us to believe, all of this appears to besimply ridiculous, quite outrageous and over the top. That Icke must bea candidate for the funny farm, eh? But that is exactly what you aresupposed to think. Human beings are indoctrinated with such aninaccurate version of history and of reality that even if the suppressionfails and truth comes out, it is so different from the indoctrinatedversion, that people just laugh and say it’s off the wall.

As I keep onstressing, the overwhelming majority will not know what they are apart 0£ It is as vital for the elite to keep them in the dark as it is forthe mass of the population to be kept in ignorance. It couldn’t work ifthe membership knew the game plan because most would wantnothing to do with it, and the brotherhood branches, like thefreemasons, need an acceptable public face to hide behind. Theirmembers below certain levels of initiation provide that with theirdinner dances and their charity work. It’s the same with most of theothers. Even lower levels of the secret societies are used formanipulation of local councils, courts, commerce and police officers,but most supporters of the Brotherhood are’very decent, kind, people.It is the elite we need to concern ourselves with and, at least in thegreat majority of cases, that does not even include politicians. Theyare pawns like everyone else. Those who work within theBrotherhood societies at the lower levels and haven’t realised the trueagenda, no longer have the excuse of ignorance. The IlluminatiProtocols make clear that the masonic lodges and the lower degreespeopled by what they call “Goy cattle” are merely there to providethe elite with “a show army in order to throw dust in the eyes of theirfellows”. These unsuspecting, naive, masons should understand thatthey are expendable, too, in the eyes of the Illuminati. Everyone is.The elite’s obsession with world domination is their sole, driving,motivation. One Illuminati protocol points out that what it calls “GoyMasons” who know too much will be dealt with after the elite “comeinto their Kingdom”. Another says:“We execute masons in such wise (sic) that none save thebrotherhood can ever have a suspicion of it, not even the victimsthemselves of our death sentence, they all die when required as if froma normal kind of illness.

They have had some colossal failures I’m sure,and they have had periods through history when they have been lesseffective than at other times. But as each successive generation withinthe Brotherhood has passed on the initiations and indoctrination to thenext one, its power to affect and decide the outcome of events hasgrown, particularly over the last two hundred years, as globalcommunications and the world financial system has allowed enormouspower to be held by the very few. The Brotherhood now pervades everyarea of our lives, and through the media which it also controls it can dripfeed the population in ways it could never do before. Their plan todominate the world, which goes under the name of the New World Orderis reaching its conclusion - if we don’t wake up fast. In his period asPresident of the United States, George Bush even used those words NewWorld Order to describe his vision of the future after the Gulf War.The Brotherhood elite which includes the Rothschild and Rockefellerempires now have six main front organisations for their covert activities.They are the Council on Foreign Relations, the Trilateral Commission,the Club of Rome, the Bilderberg Group, the Royal Institute ofInternational Affairs, and the United Nations. All of these came directly,or indirectly, from the Round Table secret society set up by thefreemason, Cecil Rhodes, and the Round Table still stands at the centreof this empire of control. Around that symbolic table sit the few whodirect the world’s political and economic affairs. This empire is, ineffect, the World Government in waiting, waiting that is, to become theofficial one.The aptly named Harold Pratt House at 58 East 68th Street in NewYork is the headquarters of the Council on Foreign Relations. It wasstarted with Rockefeller money in 1921. We have seen how this ‘thinktank’ controlled events during the Second World War and it hascontinued to do so. Appointees from the CFR have been numerous andprominent within successive United States administrations, and theforeign and domestic policy of a supposedly free and democratic nationis controlled by this non-elected Brotherhood front group. If they directUS foreign policy, of course, they do so for the world. The CFR hasaffiliated organisations right across the US. It is the American arm of theRoyal Institute of International Affairs in London, which is also knownas ‘Chatham House’. This was set up in 1920 by “former delegates to theParis Peace Conference of 1919”, - and these two ‘think tanks’working in concert are the reason for the so-called ‘special"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"197relationship’ between Britain and the USA, and was responsible alsofor manipulating the Americans into the Second World War. TheInstitute* is obviously very influential in the foreign policy of theUnited Kingdom, and other countries have similar organisationsunder its influence. The Trilateral Commission was launched byDavid Rockefeller, the chairman of the Chase Manhattan Bank andhead of the Rockefeller family empire. It was made public in 1973,but almost certainly existed in secret in 1920. The Commissionconsists of invited financiers, industrialists, media moguls, unionleaders, and politicians from North America, Western Europe andJapan, and its aim is to control the course of international events, inorder to protect and expand the interests of the elite in those threeareas of the world. The symbolism of the triangle should be noted. Itis a major brotherhood symbol. Within three years of going public ithad achieved its ambition of installing the first TnLateralist presidentin the White House, Jimmy Carter, and his ‘National SecurityAdviser’ was Zbigniew Brzezinski, the commission’s first directorand a leading inspiration behind its formation. Carter filled hisadministration with Trilateralists, among them his Vice-President,Walter Mondale, and Secretary of State, Cyrus Vance.The Bilderberg Group is another forum for Europe’s and America’sleading politicians, financiers, industrialists, media executives, andmilitary leaders to discuss the course of human affairs. TheRothschilds and Rockefellers are the power behind the BilderbergGroup, which is the European and NATO connection within theBrotherhood empire. The Bilderberg meetings were started, yet againwith Rockefeller and Rothschild money, by Prince Bernhard of theHouse of Orange in the Netherlands. The name Bilderberg comesfrom the hotel in the Netherlands where the group first met in 1954,though the existence of the group was denied for many years. Someresearchers claim that Prince Bernhard was a member of the SSbefore the war and employee of I. G. Farben. After marrying into theHouse of Orange he became chairman of Shell Oil. He chaired themeetings until 1976 when he was forced to resign in a corruptionscandal. Bilderberg meetings are held in strict secrecy, and only* Others attending included Queen Beatrice of the Netherlands, Queen Sophia of Spain, theowner of the Washington Post) the chairman of Ruper Murdoch’s News International, theeditor of the Wall Street Journal, and a stream of prime ministers, politicians, bankers andindustrialists."},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"198if you know an insider can you find out anything of their discussions.Lord Carrington, the former British cabinet minister and Secretary-General of NATO, is a prominent Bilberger, and became chairman in1991. He is also a president of the Royal Institute of InternationalAffairs. He works closely with the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers,and with Henry Kissinger, the former US Secretary of State.Kissinger is a Bilberger, a Trilateralist and a member of the Councilon Foreign Relations. Lord Carrington was a founding board memberof Kissinger Associates. Both are also on the board of the HollingerCorporation (chairman Conrad Black, a Bilberger and owner of theLondon Daily Telegraph and theJerusalem Post.The Club of Rome is another ‘think tank’ organisation whichclaims to be developing a strategy for the survival of the planet andit, too, supports the idea of centralised planning and worldgovernment. Finally, there is the United Nations which is based inNew York on land given by the Rockefellers. The plan for the UNwas hatched during the last War by a secret steering committee of theCouncil on Foreign Relations. The UN was sold to the world underthe cloak of pursuing peace among nations. Unlike its predecessor,the League of Nations, this one was going to stick and serve theBrotherhood. If one world war wouldn’t persuade governments to doas the elite required, give them another one; that did it. For UnitedNations read United States, and for USA and UN read New WorldOrder.The Round Table and its subsidiaries control the United Nations. Itwas their creation and on all decisions that matter they call the shots.Out of this has come the International Monetary Fund and the WorldBank, and the ground is now being prepared for a world army underUN (Brotherhood) control. NATO is already run by the Brotherhood.Conflicts are being triggered and inflamed across the globe to softenup public opinion to accept this as the only way to deal with thegathering violence. The more horrendous the pictures the mediabroadcast from the world trouble spots, the better it is for those whowant a centrally-controlled world army. The UN Secretary GeneralDr. Boutros Ghali has already called for a permanent, heavily armed,UN force to be in situ by 1995. At a meeting of the Bilderberg Groupat Baden Baden, Germany, m 1991, Henry Kissinger, is reported inSpotlight to have said: “A UN army must be able to act immediately,without the delays involved in each country making its own decisionson whether to participate based on parochial considerations”."},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"199Governments don’t run the world the Brotherhood does.

It is the Bilderberg Group’s permanentexecutive that runs the show, as it is with these other frontorganisations. One of those invited to the Baden Baden meeting ofthe Bilderbergers in 1991, incidentally, was the then governor ofArkansas, one Bill Clinton, who went on to become President.

Ifyou look at the world today you can see how nations are alreadylosing the power to make decisions to giant trading blocs like theEuropean Community and the North American Free Trade Agreement(NAFTA), and in Europe the move is towards one currency and oneEuropean Central Bank. The pieces are being moved around theboard in preparation for the ‘sting’. It is revealing to note, also, howso many politicians who oppose this loss of national sovereigntysuddenly find themselves discredited and have their power removed.Spotlight, the investigative Washington DC paper, reported in May1989 that the Bilderberg meeting that month on La Toya Island, offSpain, had decided that Margaret Thatcher would be removed asBritish Prime Minister, because of her “refusal to yield Britishsovereignty to the European Superstate that is to emerge after 1992”.That is exactly what happened when she was removed while in officeby her own side, the British Conservative Party in 1990.

They are alsoundermining the world economy, which they control, to destroy whatremains of the confidence the population has in politicians andgovernments.

The crowning is planned to take place in arebuilt Solomon’s Temple in Jerusalem, which would replace theMoslem Mosque currently on that site.

Some scientists have identified pulseswhich they believe to be radio waves caused by a star which blewapart around 4,OOOBC. The Sumerian star catalogue, which has beenshown to be very accurate, predicted that the blazing star would beseen again on Earth in 6,000 years - around now. Perhaps theBrotherhood intends to use what it believes to be the return of thatexploding star to usher in its New World Order and the world king. If itcan cause so much mayhem in the world before then, people will beonly too willing to believe in some Second Coming to bring ‘peace’ tohumanity -especially if this is combined with amazing sights in thesky.

The overall ambition,however, remains the same. To imprison the human race, mentally,emotionally, spiritually and physically.Investigators of the New World Order and brotherhood historycome from all shades of belief.

I will take moreof this in a later chapter, but suffice to say now that the world mediais almost totally under Brotherhood control and where they don’tactually run the publication, they control the ‘information’ that itreceives. Most journalists (and there are some honorable exceptions)are in a mental prison, again most of them without realising it. I havemet many who clearly think they are street-wise about the worldwhen if they only opened their eyes they would see that they are littlemore than copy typists for the manipulators. They largely‘investigate’ irrelevances or subjects which suit the Brotherhood’sdesired plan. What the public really need to know is never addressed.I heard Harold Evans, the former editor of the London Times andSunday Times, talking on the radio of the appalling way the media"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"205tycoon Rupert Murdoch, his former boss, runs his vast worldnewspaper and broadcasting empire to suit his own commercial andpolitical interests (and who else’s?). Evans described how MargaretThatcher in her years as British Prime Minister was “Murdoch’spoodle” who did as she was told.I found it particularly interesting in the light of this book, thatEvans also made the point that while American journalists werecommitting endless time, money, and energy into investigating thebedroom habits of Bill Clinton, and the financial speculation of hiswife, the terrible effect of the Federal Reserve Board on the USeconomy went unchallenged. But then, after what this book hasrevealed, that is no longer a surprise, is it? Most so calledprofessionaljournalists are irrelevant to real information gatheringand communication. That is being done by researchers who have thecourage to search for truth and the magazines now springing into lifewhich are prepared to print it.John Swainton, Editor of the prestigious New York Times in the /4860s and 70s in a retirement speech to his staff said:“There is no such thing as a free press. You know it and I know it.There’s not one of you who would dare to write his honest opinions.The business of a journalist is to destroy truth, to lie outright, topervert, to vilify, to fawn at the fret of Mammon, and to sell himselfhis country and his race for his daily bread. We are tools and vassalsof rich men behind the scenes. We are jumping jacks; they pull thestrings, we dance; our talents, our possibilities and our lives are theproperty of these men. We are intellectual prostitutes.“*The main difference between researchers of the New World Orderis over the existence or not of extra-terrestrials in all this. I havemade it clear in the book that I do believe ETs exist and that theyseeded the human form as we know it. I feel their direct involvement,on Earth at least, dramatically reduced after Atlantis, but I feel theyhave continued to have an effect, positive and negative, on humanevolution. I think they have worked through human consciousnessand when you see in due course the mind controlling techniquesavailable to the Illuminati’s human scientists and manipulators, you* Quoted by Dana Baker in her article on “Media Suppression” in Profile Magazine."},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"206will appreciate that anything is possible for extra-terrestrials who arefar in advance of us technologically and in their mind-controllingpotential. It is important to remember also, given the themes I havebeen suggesting through human history, that the ETs have had thisknowledge and potential throughout the period covered by this book.It could well be that negative ETs (by far the minority) have controlof the minds of the Illuminati, and I believe that to be the case. TheIlluminati are victims, too, and mind-controlled to mind controleveryone else since ancient times. That is not to say that I accept allthe UFO stories. There is a great deal of disinformation being putabout to confuse and divert and I feel that some claims about UFOsare being used to cover up Brotherhood activities, for reasons I willexplain later. But for the moment, let us look at the evidence for thedirect involvement of ETs on Earth today.Human history is littered with stories of strange lights and ‘gods’ inthe sky, unidentified flying objects, and the appearance of ET-typefigures. Of course not all will be genuine, and there were probablynon-UFO explanations for most of them, but it is silly just to writethem all off as some people do. The reports increased in moderntimes from the early 1940s and a number of incidents have beenreported of extra-terrestrial bodies being found. The most famous isknown as the Roswell incident which has been documented by manyresearchers, including Tim Good in his books on the subject.On July 2nd 1947, the story goes, at least one spacecraft crashedduring a storm in the New Mexico desert near a place called Corona,seventy-five miles North-west of Roswell. The crash left a trail ofdebris a mile long and a hundred yards wide. A ranch hand, ‘Mac’Brazel, picked up some of the remains, strange pieces of metal whichwere incredibly light and strong which had written upon themgeometrical symbols and hieroglyphics. The ranch hand didn’t tellthe authorities about this find for several days and when he did somepersonnel from the Roswell army-air base arrived to investigate.After they reported to the base commander he authorised a pressrelease announcing they had found a flying saucer. This was printedin the local papers and one report said:“The office of the 509th bombardment group at Roswell Army AirField announced at Noon today that the field was in possession of aflying saucer.”"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"207Suddenly the higher levels of the military arrived on the scene andthe cover-up began. They withdrew the press release and launched aweather balloon which they immediately caused to crash. They madethis available for press pictures claiming that the balloon and not aflying saucer had been found. Meanwhile, in another area of thecrash site, a civil engineer working on an irrigation project and agroup of archeologists found four extra-terrestrials. Three were deadand one was still alive, so the story says. They were described asthree to four feet tall wearing very tight, space suit-type clothing, butwith no cover on the heads or hands. The military closed off theentire area and those who saw either the crashed craft or the bodieswere threatened by the authorities and warned of the consequences ifthey revealed what they had seen. The local radio station, KGFL NewMexico, was visited by the military after recording an interview witha witness and told that if they wanted to be on the air twenty-fourhours later they should hand over the interview and forget it everhappened. This they did. A local mortician who accidentally lookedinto an operating theatre and saw one of the extra-terrestrial bodieswas told that he would be ‘dead bones’ if he opened his mouth. Asoldier, Sergeant Melvin E Brown, was told to guard somethingwithout being told what it was. When he investigated he found extra-terrestrial bodies. Brown told his family very little, but his daughtersremember him saying that the bodies he saw had larger heads thanhumans, and no hair. They looked yellowy in colour and their slantedeyes reminded him of the Chinese. It could have been this race that‘seeded’ the Chinese, perhaps. The extra-terrestrial races that visit theEarth are many and diverse, and therefore, so are the races of theEarth which they originally created, and possibly continue to affectgenetically. Brown was terrified to reveal anything more of what heknew to his dying day, but now people are beginning to speak outand describe their experiences. More than two hundred peoplewitnessed something of this story.There has been much speculation about the events that followedthe discovery of these craft and their occupants in a number ofincidents during the 1940s and ‘SOs. Many investigators and insiderinformants have said that an ET was found alive in another incidentnear Roswell in 1949. He was given the name ‘EBE’ orExtraterrestrial Biological Entity, and lived until 1952. Hismetabolism worked much like a plant, with nourishment absorbedthrough the skin. EBE, and other ETs found alive over the years,"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"208passed on some astonishing information to the Americans, it is said,which transformed their understanding of Creation and the origins ofthe human race as we know it. What they were told, according tosome writers, supports the themes of ET activity and ‘seeding’ of thehuman form by ETs, according to some writers. A few researchers,especially the former member of American Naval Intelligence, BillCooper, go much further than most and claim a secret conspiracybetween the Illuminati and a race of negative ETs which, he believes,started in the 1950s. He highlights this in his book, Behold a PaleHorse. In summary, he suggests the following hypothesis based onwhat he saw in Naval Intelligence and what he has been told by his‘contacts’ since then. To save putting the next few paragraphs inquotes or adding in endless “Cooper says” or “Cooper claims”,please keep in mind throughout this little section that the following iswhat Bill Cooper is saying, and not me.Cooper reckons that following the information passed on by theEBE, Project Sign, later called Project Grudge, was launched toinvestigate what was going on. Another project, called Blue Book,was formed to issue disinformation and hamper outsideinvestigations. President Truman formed the National SecurityAgency in 1952 by secret executive order with the task of starting acommunication with the ETs. The National Security Agency (NSA) isnot subject to any laws in the United States, which do not specificallymention it by name. The work of the NSA is about as secret as youcan get, and it is by far the most important arm of the Amencar.’intelligence agencies. It attracts most of the funding. Truman told thehighest levels of the allies and the Soviet Union of what had beenfound. The NSA’s main job was to find ways of communicating withthe ETs and establish the background to their activity. This was donethough a special project code named SIGMA.Dwight D Eisenhower, the Supreme Allied Commander in WorldWar II, became President in 1953 thanks to encouragement andsupport from the Rockefellers. He was another president from theCouncil on Foreign Relations. More spacecraft and extra-terrestrialswere found and he engaged his friend and CFR member NelsonRockefeller to help with the ET problem. Rockefeller used theopportunity to restructure the administration of government to makeit easier to manipulate, after he was made chairman of thePresidential Advisory Committee on Governmental Organisation.Nelson Rockefeller was a Republican who was elected governor of"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"209New York State four times and rose to the position of AssistantSecretary of State under Roosevelt, even though that was aDemocratic administration. He would later become Vice-Presidentafter twice losing to Richard Nixon in the race for the RepublicanPresidential nomination.Communications were eventually made with a race of ETs whoclaimed to come from a planet linked to the star Betelgeuse in theconstellation of Orion. The communications were made thanks to thework of Project SIGMA. The ETs took a high orbit over the Equatorand the Americans, says Cooper, used computer binary language toset up a landing and face to face meeting. This happened in 1954when a group of ETs landed at the Holloman Air Force base and laterat the Edwards Air Force Base where they met Eisenhower himsel£Both the landings and the meeting were filmed, apparently, andsomewhere the film still exists.The claims about this meeting are supported by other sources. It isknown that Eisenhower was on vacation in Palm Springs, playinggolf at this time. He was staying with his friend Paul Roy Helms atthe Smoke Tree Ranch, but on the relevant day 20th February 1954,he ‘went missing’ for four hours. This would have given him plentyof time to get to the Edwards Air Force Base (then called Muroc), toattend the meeting. The official explanation for his disappearancewas that he had to visit a local dentist after losing a cap on his toothwhile eating a chicken leg. No proof of this has ever been offered.The meeting with the ETs led to an agreement. They would notinterfere with human affairs so long as their presence was kept asecret, and they were allowed to abduct a certain number of peoplefor research purposes because they had major problems on their ownplanet, particularly with reproduction. The ETs said the humanswould have no memory of the abductions, because of their ability toprogramme the mind. The Americans agreed to a limited number ofabductions on the understanding that the humans would not beharmed, and in return the ETs said they would pass on highlyadvanced technology and the knowledge of how to time-travel.It was agreed that the ETs would not work with any other nation,and that there would be an exchange of personnel and ‘ambassadors’.Underground bases would be established in the United States for theextra-terrestrials and for the exchange of technology. These were tobe under Indian Reservations in the area known as Four Corners inUtah, and in New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado and a location known"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"210as Area 51 or ‘Dreamland’ near Groom Lake in Nevada. The ETsbegan to pass on their technology here in an area called S-4, codenamed the Dark Side of the Moon. Project Redlight was created tobegin the experimental flights of the ET technology now in UShands, and various projects were begun to maintain total secrecy ofwhat was happening. Project Snowbird had the task of rubbishingany reports of’UFOs’ over the United States. One way they did thiswas to show the press what experiments they were doing withconventional technology which they used as a way to explain someUFO sightings. In fact they had technology to overcome gravity, andthey had their own space craft in the 1950s which, by comparison,make today’s Space Shuttle look like the technological equivalent ofa London taxi. The Space Shuttle, like the technology used in the‘first’ Moon landing, is a con, a cover for what is really going on.Cooper says the underground facilities were paid for with a secretfund administered by the Military Office in the White House. Thismoney was laundered many times before it reached its destination, tomask the origin and purpose. Eisenhower was the last president toknow what was really going on, and later presidents who asked aboutthe fund were told it was to build underground shelters for thegovernment in times of war. President Lyndon Johnson used it tobuild a cinema and a road on his ranch, because he had no idea of itstrue purpose. There are now, Bill Cooper says, underground sites forthe military and ETs all over the States. Most presidents afterEisenhower have been told only that extra-terrestrials with problemson their own planet want to settle here and are handing overincredible gifts of technology in return. Some have known nothing.Eisenhower set up a permanent committee to supervise all covertoperations relating to the ETs. It was called the Majesty 12 (MJ-12)and consisted, according to Cooper’s research, of NelsonRockefeller, CIA Director Allen Welsh Dulles, Secretary of StateJohn Foster Dulles, Secretary of Defence Charles E Wilson, theChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Arthur W Radford, theFBI Director J Edgar Hoover, and six men from the executivecommittee of the Council on Foreign Relations. These were known asthe ‘Wise Men’ and they were all members of a secret society calledthe Jason Society or the Jason Scholars. These recruited membersfrom the Skull and Bones and the Scroll and Key secret societies atthe Harvard and Yale Universities. George Bush was a member of theSkull and Bones and would later join the Council on Foreign"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"211Relations and become head of the CIA. MJ-12 has had many changesof name over the years, it would appear. Under Eisenhower andKennedy it was called the Special Group; under Johnson it was the303 Committee; under Nixon, Ford, and Carter it became the 40Committee, and under Reagan it was known as P1-40. More recentlythere has been an attempt to promote disinformation with a ‘briefingpaper’ which mentions an organisation called Majestic 12. Severalpresidents, including Carter and Reagan, have talked of seeing UFOsbefore they took office. Carter said during his election campaign that,if elected, he would reveal every piece of information available aboutthem to the public and the scientists. Perhaps he intended to, but henever did.Eisenhower soon realised that the ETs were not keeping to theiragreement. Mutilated animals and people were being found acrossthe country and many abductees were clearly not being returned tothe Earth. The Americans now found out that the ETs wereinteracting with the Soviet Union and that, Cooper says, .......they hadbeen manipulating humanity through the secret societies, mysticismand religion for a very long time. They had control of the mind ofAdolf Hitler and all of those ‘evil’ people who have made humanitysuffer so much.Eisenhower established a committee to investigate what washappening. Cooper’s sources say it consisted of members of theCouncil on Foreign Relations and the Jason Society. ZbigniewBrzezinski, the instigator and first director of the TrilateralCommission, was also the director of this new committee for the firsteighteen months with Henry Kissinger taking over from him. Thisgroup was called Quantico II after the marine base at Quantico,Virginia, where its later meetings took place. Nelson Rockefeller hada retreat built in Maryland which could only be reached by air, whichhe did specifically for meetings of this group and MJ 12. Thislocation was code named the Country Club. In the end they decidedthat the only way to proceed was to continue to seek friendlyrelations with the ETs. The working relationship has continued eversince although not without conflict and disagreements. It could bethat it is not all dense physical interaction, perhaps. It may be thatthere is psychic communication between ETs and those capable ofreceiving their frequency.So that is Bill Cooper’s hypothesis. What do we make of it?Personally, my intuition tells me that disinformation has been fed to"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"212him, but on the basis that the best disinformation mixes truth withfiction, we should not perhaps write it off in the rather arrogant waywhich some have done. No one has a monopoly on truth, especiallywhen the Brotherhood security services are drooping disinfromationall over the place. I feel there has been contact between ETs and theAmerican secret government, and that it continues today, but it doesnot have to be a dense physical interaction. It may be psychiccommunications between ETs and those capable of tuning to theirfrequency. The Brotherhood uses psychics a lot. Whatever is thereality of this, it’s about time the Pinnochio politicians of the world,especially those who claim to represent the American people inCongress, got off their knees and started making waves to make surethe relevant information on these ‘UFO’ incidents is made public. Ifeel that the time is not too far away when the truth of the ETconnection will be made known.Another ‘insider’ who says he wants people to know what ishappening, is Bob Dean. He says he was a soldier in the US Army fortwenty-seven years and was promoted to Cosmic Top Secret Level,the highest in NATO, while serving at the S.H.A.P.E Headquarters inEurope. According to him, many UFOs were being tracked by NATOforces in the 1950s and ’60s. He suggests that an investigation waslaunched under the cover of a study called ‘An evaluation of apossible military threat to Allied Forces in Europe’. It included areport on what were said to have been twelve bodies found inNorthern Europe in 1962. The report concluded says Dean, that theplanet has been the subject of a detailed survey by extra-terrestrialsof many kinds for hundreds, possibly thousands of years, and theirtechnology was hundreds of years ahead of ours. I certainly agreewith the analysis.Dean quotes Victor Marchetti, a former special assistant to theexecutive director of the CIA, as saying privately in 1979:“We have indeed been contacted, perhaps even visited by, extra-terrestrial beings, and the US Government, in collusion with the otherpowers of Europe, is determined to keep this information from thegeneral public. The purpose of this international conspiracy is tomaintain a working stability between the nations of the world, and forthem, in turn, to maintain institutional control over their respectivepopulations.“For these governments to admit that there are beings from outer"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"213space with mentalities and technological capabilities obviously farsuperior to ours, could, once fully perceived by the average person,erode the foundations of the Earth’s traditional power structures.“Political and legal systems, religious, economic and socialinstitutions, could all become meaningless in the minds of the generalpublic. The national hierarchical establishments, even civilisation aswe know it, could collapse into anarchy.”Researcher Tim Good in his books suggests that the RAF have hadnumerous experiences with UFOs and that their UFO investigationscentre is within the headquarters of the Provost and Security Servicesat RAF Rudloe Manor in Wiltshire. The UFO Unit, it is said, operatessecretly under the cover of an organisation called the FlyingComplaints Flight.This unit is staffed by officers trained in counter-intelligence and itcould well have been from here that the crop circle phenomena hasbeen systematically destroyed in the public mind. The patterns in thecrops have appeared all over the world, but it was when the amazinglydetailed geometric patterns began to appear in Southern England in theearly 1990s that the disinformation campaign really began. Public andmedia interest reached such a peak at the time that something had to bedone to stop it. People were asking questions about possible causes,and they were beginning to realise that there was more to life and theUniverse than they had been led to believe. In addition to the fewmaterialistic tricksters trying to show that the phenomenon could beeasily explained, there erupted organised campaigns to hoax, and todiscredit the best known crop circle investigators. People appeared outof nowhere claiming to have made all the crop circles that appearedover decades all over the world. Ridiculous as this may seem, thepublic, which in general are incredibly gullible, bought the idea thatthe phenomenon was all a gigantic hoax. Interest in crop circlesslumped dramatically. They are still appearing, with unhoaxablegeometry, but only the enthusiasts know about them now. The mediahas lost all interest, because it is as gullible and as fickle as the generalpublic, more so in some cases, and, of course, it has a tail to wag and amaster to lick. I feel, however, that events will bring the crop patternsback onto the public stage.There is certainly a fantastic cover-up going on in the UFO field.But of what? Extra-terrestrials landing here, interacting with the elite,and abducting human beings? Or is this all just a smokescreen to hide"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"214what is really happening? Other researchers, while agreeing on allthe main themes of the New World Order conspiracy, believe that theclaims about extra-terrestrials are all disinformation and that thegenuine UFOs that people report are, in truth, human technology.They say that this advanced technology which is far ahead ofanything the public know about, was not handed over by ETs inunderground bases, but was developed by Illuminati scientists. This,some say, could have begun after the war when the Americans gothold of the work that had been done by Nazi scientists who theBrotherhood made sure escaped from Germany. Certainly it appearsthat the Nazi scientific and brotherhood elite had developed anti-gravity technology by the end of the war which used the Earth’snatural energy field for its power. It was so secret, Hitler possiblyknew nothing about it because he wasn’t in control of events; theBrotherhood who controlled him were. This Nazi technology, it isclaimed, looked like the UFOs many people describe. The AmericanAcademy of Dissident Sciences has details of this. So yes, say theseresearchers, there are UFOs, but they are built and flown by humans,not ETs. This theory says that the disinformation about ET landingsare just a way of covering up the technology they have which, if itbecame generally available, would transform the world economy andfree people from so much dependency on the System - because thetechnology used to fly these craft is the same as that which wouldprovide free energy to everyone, without the need to use fossil fuels.It is also possible that the UFO theme is being used in the publicmind to prepare for an ‘aliens are coming’ announcement which willjustify a global state of emergency and centralised control. Anythingis possible.Here we have another fusion of agreement by almost allinvestigators into these subjects. The Brotherhood elite have had, bywhatever means, human or ET, the ability to travel in space at leastsince the 1 950s and, many researchers agree, they have establishedbases on the Moon and Mars under a project which has becomeknown as Alternative Three. This was the name of an apparentlyfictional story that is perhaps nearer the truth than was originallythought. Maybe the Illuminati know the planet is about to undergosome great change on all levels and want some insurance, whoknows? What I am sure about is that the first human landed on theMoon before 1969. When Apollo 11 touched down with NeilArmstrong’s ‘One small step for man, one giant step for mankind’, it"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"215was pure Walt Disney. That ‘giant step’ had happened years earlierwith technology far in advance of Apollo. The astronauts on that‘first’ Moon landing were shocked at what they found there, becauselike most of the lower officials at Mission Control they didn’t knowthe background to what was going on. How stunned they must havebeen, but they knew the price of speaking out. According to OttoBinder, who worked on the NASA space programme, significantsegments of the conversations between Mission Control and the crewof Apollo 11 were not made public after they landed on the Moon. Hesays that people using VHF receivers to bypass NASA broadcastsheard this conversation:Mission Control: “What the hell was it? What’s there?Malfunction?”Neil Armstrong: “These babies are huge, sir......enormous. Oh God,you wouldn’t believe it. I’m telling you there are other spacecraft outtherelined up on the far side of the crater edgethey’reon the Moon watching us..”Even more amazing, those craft could well have had Americans onboard! What a joke it all is. There is a good chance, too, that theinformation given to us about the nature of the Moon and Martianatmospheres is unture and that it is far more hospitable than we are ledto believe. When, in 1960, President Kennedy agreed a programme toput a man on the Moon by the end of the decade, he innocently gavethe Brotherhood elite a wonderful vehicle, to take out of thegovernment system enormous amounts of money allocated to the‘official’ space programme, and channel them into the unofficial one.Researchers suggest that the Americans and the Soviet Union, atBrotherhood levels, were working together throughout the so-calledCold War, another Illuminati creation. It was a means of frighteningthe populations on both sides into suffering appalling hardships, whiletheir governments spent countless billions on weapons research andconstruction. No doubt there were other reasons, too.There was no prospect of either side using the weapons; that wasnot the idea. When one side got too far ahead technoligically, theywould pass the information to the other through the brotherhoodnetwork. Once the stockpiles reached a certain level, the creation ofmore weapons could not be justified, except on the grounds ofneeding to keep ahead of the other side’s technology. If they made"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"216sure that neither was too far advanced of the other, they could bothgo on demanding, and getting, more money for new research anddevelopment. This was especially important in America where they atleast had to pay lip service to democratic accountability. Much of thatdevelopment money was being channelled into the anti-gravitytechnology coming from either the ETs or their own scientists,depending on your point of view, and into building vast undergroundbases where the secrecy was ensured. Again both pro-ET and no-ETresearchers largely agree that the underground facilities exist, thoughthey may differ on precisely the reason for them. Some of the StarWars budget was used for these secret purposes, too, and for othercovert projects unkown to the people, and even most of the electedgovernment. The USA were opponents of the Soviet Union? Hardly.The lower levels of both governments and the populations may havethought so, but the Brotherhood elite on both sides were on the sameteam and played for the same captain - Lucifer and possibly thenegative ET group working through their consciousness.The Illuminati and its Brotherhood offshoots which control the CIAneeded, and still do, a constant stream of massive funding for thecovert projects they are involved in. These include the sort of things Ihave been outlining, and all the other manipulations the book hasdocumented, like the support for civil wars and despotic dictators,which the CIA has secretly supported and brought to power to servetheir interests. Next time you see an American president put his handon his heart and talk about America standing for freedom, I should sitdown before you fall over laughing. One of the main ways the covertprojects are funded is through illegal drugs. Brotherhood branchesand elements within the CIA and some of the world’s other secretservices, control the world market in drugs. Cooper and other writershave stated this and it came very close to becoming widely known inthe wake of the Iran-Contra Affair. Those who have investigated theCIA-drugs connection say it began in the late 1950s. It is claimedthat the CIA and other agencies arranged to transport drugs fromSouth America by sea to oil rigs drilling off the US coast. From therethey could be brought ashore under the cover of the oil operations.Now the CIA and other Brotherhood branches control the enite worldmarket in illegal drugs. The more the laws are tightened by so-called‘Wars on Drugs’, the higher the street value. The Americanauthorities have been so committed to the ‘War on Drugs’ that theyhave allowed US Oil companies to ship chemicals to South America"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"217which are needed to make the drugs. The story of the Iran-Contraaffair involving Oliver North during the Reagan Administration wasthe tip of a fantastic iceberg, and look at how easily it was coveredup. The American people and media want a rocket directed at theirbacksides for allowing it to happen. The invasion of Panama by USforces in 1989 which cost twenty-six lives in Operation ‘Just Cause’and led to the abduction to America of President Manuel Noriega,was linked to the covert drugs operation and the drug moneylaundered through Panama.One name that keeps coming up again and again as I read the workof investigators into all this is George Bush, the member of theCouncil on Foreign Relations, Trilateralist, former head of the CIA,and President of the United States before Bill Clinton. He was alsothe President of the offshore division of Zapata Oil, it is alleged,when that company’s offshore oil rigs were used to bring in the drugsin the 1950s. Now it cannot be fair to make accusations like thisagainst Mr Bush as some researchers do if he is innocent in thesematters. Surely it is only right that, as with Pope John Paul II, theclaims made about Mr Bush in relation to drugs and his family’sfinancial interests in Panama, are openly and publicly refuted withundeniable evidence so there can be no stain on his characterwhatsoever.All evidence points to a coordinated Brotherhood campaign to giveyoung people every opportunity to take and become hooked ondrugs. Today, finding drugs is often no problem for even children.The Brotherhood is at war with the young people of the world. Itwishes to see them drugged, their spirits shattered, their minds filledwith nonsense. They know that the energy and natural idealism of theyoung could cause them problems in their sinister ambitions. Theyneed to crush the young, and that is what they are trying to do. It istime for the young people of this planet to open their eyes and refuseto be programmed. The Protocols make clear how they intendedthrough this century to divert the young and the “Goyim” in general.It wants to stop people thinking for themselves and how well it hassucceeded:“In order that the masses themselves may not guess what they areabout we further distract them with amusements, games, pastimes,passions, people’s palaces..... Soon we shall begin through the pressto propose competitions in art, in sport of all kinds; these interests"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"218will finally distract their minds from questions in which we shouldfind ourselves compelled to oppose them. Growing more and moredisaccustomed to reflect and form any options of their own, peoplewill begin to talk in the same tone as we, because alone we shall beoffering them new directions of thought of course through suchpersons as will not be suspected of solidarity with us.” (IlluminatiProtocol 13).One president who stood up for his principles was John Kennedy andhe paid for it with his life in Dallas, Texas, on November 22nd 1963.Kennedy does not appear to have been from the Council on ForeignRelations. He scraped into power at the 1960 Election by less than100,000 votes and the Brotherhood almost certainly wanted hischallenger, Richard Nixon. There is, of course, great mystery andcontroversy surrounding (a) who killed Kennedy and (b) why? Whatthere is no controversy about, to anyone with eyes and a brain, is thathe was assassinated in a military style operation. The ‘evidence’ thathe was killed by a ‘lone assassin’ Lee Harvey Oswald is so hysterical,I won’t insult your intelligence with it. Oswald was a member of theUS secret services who was set up over a long period of time, and theKennedy assassination was no last minute decision. It was carefullyorganised by the Brotherhood that runs the secret government of theUnited States. The ‘who?’ is clear to me, but what about the ‘why’.Kennedy was bad news for the Brotherhood elite. He promised to“splinter the CIA into a thousand pieces”. It is said by someresearchers that he had found out about the drug operation and orderedit to be stopped: he certainly wanted to sort out the Federal Reserve,the cartel of Brotherhood banking interests that control the Americaneconomy; and he wanted to withdraw from the Brotherhood-engineered Vietnam War and end the cold war with the Soviet Union.All these things struck at the very heart of the Brotherhood operationsand long term planning. Those researchers who accept the claimsabout the ET connection say that Kennedy had also found out aboutthat, and was planning to reveal it; but I am not saying this is correct.The evidence uncovered by the courageous people who would notaccept the cover-up has made it crystal clear that Oswald could nothave been the assassin, and that the killer bullet came from the otherdirection.

Bill Cooper believes the crucial shot came from the"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"219driver of Kennedy’s car, secret service agent, William Greer and citesthe Zapruder film in support of this. Others say the shot came frombehind the crowd. Oswald said he had been set up, but he wasconveniently killed by another stooge, the night club owner JackRuby, before he could come to trial. Witnesses who saw things thatundermined the cover-up version of events were harrassed,intimidated, or killed. Kennedy’s body was rushed by plane fromDallas to Washington for autopsy by military pathologists who woulddo as they were told and make the ‘correct’ report. Near the scene ofthe assassination today, like some grizzly two fingers to the world, isan obelisk dedicated to freemasonry. This was nothing less than aBrotherhood coup on the United States.Kennedy was replaced by his vice-president, Lyndon Johnson, afreemason. He immediately ordered the blood-stained and bullet-holed car to be cleaned and repaired, so destroying more evidence,and just as quickly reversed Kennedy’s withdrawal policy inVietnam. Under him the war quickly escalated and when it ended,two million Asian and 58,000 American lives had been lost and $220billion had been spent. The Vietnam war was a grotesque human andfinancial killing in the classic Brotherhood mould. The Cold War alsocontinued and weapons spending increased massively, just as theBrotherhood wanted.Johnson set up the pathetic Warren Commission to ‘investigate’Kennedy’s death. Earl Warren was a freemason and the whole thingwas the most obvious cover-up. Some witnesses said their evidencehad been changed and even their signatures forged. Most of theCommission was made up of people from the Council on ForeignRelations, and the cover-up was completed by 33rd degree mason JEdgar Hoover, the head of the FBI, and yet another freemason, theformer CIA Director, Allen Welsh Dulles. Five years later, JackKennedy’s brother Robert was assassinated at the Ambassador Hotelin Los Angeles after making a speech in his campaign to win theDemocratic presidential domination. I believe that he, Martin LutherKing, and John Lennon was all murderd by the same force.The Brotherhood makes and breaks presidents almost at will, and itis the same in other countries, too. According to Bill Cooper andothers, President Nixon intended to fight to the end when faced withimpeachment over the Watergate scandal. The Brotherhood wantedno such impeachment hearings and told him to resign. When herefused, the Joint Chiefs of Staff sent a top secret message to the"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"220commanders of US forces all over the world. According to Cooper,who claims to have seen the message while working for NavalIntelligence, it said: “Upon Receipt of this message, you will nolonger carry out any orders from the White House. Acknowledgereceipt”. It was another five days before Nixon resigned. Whoreplaced him? Thirty-third degree mason, Gerald Ford, who, in 1974,made Nelson Rockefeller his Vice-President. (The Thirty-thriddegree is divided into two parts - one knows the real agenda, theother does not.)Today, the Brotherhood secret government continues to control theUnited States and continues its preparations for global coup. A bookby Bob Woodward, one of the journalists who investigatedWatergate, is already suggesting that the economic policy of theDemocrat, President Clinton, is being directed by Alan Green-span,the Republican chairman of the Federal Reserve Board who wasappointed by President Reagan and re-appointed by President Bush.Clinton has also announced increased trading links with China,despite the disgraceful civil rights record of that country, but thenmoney always speaks louder than principles. Is Bill Clinton a Thirty-third degree Mason as some researchers suggest? Is he a mason at allor a member of any other Brotherhood-type secret society? Has heever been? What is his connection to the Council on ForeignRelations, the Trilateral Commission, and the Bilderberg Group?These are legitimate questions which the public needs to haveanswered. They are far more important, media of needs to America,than what he does or does not do in hotel bedrooms. One thing is forsure, if the Brotherhood had not selected Bill Clinton, with orwithout his knowledge, he would not be president:“Then it was that the era of republics became possible ofrealisation; and then it was that we replaced the ruler by a caricatureof a government - by a president taken from the mob, from the midst ofour puppet creatures, our slaves.” (Illuminati Protocol 10).What we also need to know is the extent of the Lucifer cults withinAmerican military intelligence and the CIA. One report has alreadycome to light about Lieutenant-Colonel Michael Aquino, a seniorofficer within US Military Intelligence. He formed the Temple of Set(the ancient Egyptian name for Lucifer), and when it was madepublic, the authorities said they had no problem with that. If there"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"221was a purge on secret, Lucifer-inspired, cults and societies within thesecret services of the world, the intelligence network would probablycollapse due to lack of personnel! Interestingly, Aquino served as apsychological warfare specialist in Vietnam and this has become anincreasingly important weapon for the Illuminati.The secret development of mind control techniques by theintelligence agencies have also reached an advanced stage. Theseagencies operate outside of democratic control. Thirty-third degreefreemason, Gerald Ford, launched a Commission to look into theworkings of the security services after the Watergate scandal. Whodid he ask to chair it? Nelson Rockefeller! If it wasn’t so tragic, youcould almost laugh. The CIA and its fellow agencies around theworld, including the British, have been spending billions onresearch into mind-controlling and population controlling-techniques. These involve, among other things, drugs, brainwashing, brain implants to turn people literally into robots, theinjection of experimental viruses, hypnosis, and the use ofelectromagnetic fields, according to researchers of these subjects. Ifyou think humans have been robots up to now, stick around, unlesswe take action now. Mind control goes back to the ancientBrotherhood mystery schools and beyond. The Nazis wereperfecting it before and during the war and so were the Americanagencies which became the CIA. In the 1950s the CIA was fundingmind-controlling projects with code names like Project Bluebird(Artichoke after 1953) and later Project MK-ULTRA. The Britishand many other agencies were doing the same, as informationcrossed borders on the Brotherhood networks.The CIA was funding tests into LSD and similar drugs in the 1950sand ’60s and some horrendous experiments have been done in thestate prisons and psychiatric institutions, involving children as wellas adults. Don’t let them kid you the Nazis had a monopoly on suchthings. Anything they have done, the ‘good guys’ are also doing inthe lands of ‘freedom andjustice’. As this book was going to press,the US Government admitted that people, including mentallyhandicapped children and pregnant mothers, had been used in thepast for experiments, without their knowledge and consent, into theeffects of radiation. The past? Similar things are still happening! Soif you are seeking to escape this mad world through drugs.... don’t,don’t, don’t. LSD was not the liberating drug it was claimed by somany to be. It was researched and encouraged by the CIA, the British"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"222Secret Service and others and, to a large extent, it thwarted the 1960srevolution and the desire of the baby boomers for mental freedom, bysubverting their values with a lack of direction. Don’t let it happenagain!! The mass prescribing of anti-depressants and other drugsworld-wide is playing its part in advancing the zombie mentalitywhich the Brotherhood want to bring about. Some of thesetechniques have undoubtedly been used to take out people whothreaten Brotherhood operations. You can appreciate how it can bedone when you see what one CIA psychiatrist said about the use ofhypnosis and the implantation of minute electrodes in the brain:“The subject who was able to develop good post-hypnotic amnesiawill also respond to suggestions to remember events which did notactually occur. On awakening, he will fail to recall the real events ofthe trance and instead will recall the suggested events. If anything,this phenomena is easier to produce than total amnesia, perhapsbecause it eliminates the subjective freling of an empty space in thememory.”What a great way to programme a ‘lone assassin’. I have no doubtthat many of the ‘abductions’ claimed to have been by UFOoccupants are in reality abductions by human servants of Lucifer inthe Brotherhood. That is not to say that people aren’t abducted byETs, but this is used as a cover for Brotherhood activities of exactlythe same kind, too. Suggestions are implanted into the victims’ mind,as described above, so they believe they have been taken andimplanted by ETs when it has really been done to them by humans.Under deep hypnosis by those who are investigating this phenomena,many of these ‘ET victims’ have recalled being taken away in a van,sometimes marked US Navy. Perhaps the vans are an example of theadvanced technology that the Americans have given the ETs inexchange for theirs! I’ll swap you this inter-galactic, inter-frequency,anti-gravity craft, for a Ford truck. Yes, sounds reasonable. It’s adeal.Many people who have said they were abducted by UFOs havebeen found to have brain implants which can be seen on X-Rays.Apparent UFO victims have often recalled having operations duringtheir ordeal, in which needles are inserted into the brain. Because thistechnology is not familiar to ‘normal’ science, it is assumed that ithas come from some extra-terrestrial source. But, for whatever"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"223reason, the science of the Brotherhood has put them years ahead ofthe science the rest of us know. Brotherhood scientists working oncode-named projects have developed an electrode which can receiveand transmit signals, produce visions and hallucinations, and havecomplete physical control of a person’s body. Given that the ETshave always known of these techniques, it puts some of the ‘spiritualrevelations’ of St Paul, Moses, Mohamet, John of Revelations, andthe Mormon founder, Joseph Smith, into another perspective, maybe?Too incredible to believe? Let me quote the words of Dr JoseDelgado, when he was a psychologist at Yale University decades ago:“Physical control of many brain functions is a demonstrated fact....it is even possible to create and follow intentions, the development ofthoughts and visual experiences. By electrical stimulation of specificcerebral structures movements can be induced by radio command,hostility may appear and disappear, social hierarchy can be modified,sexual behaviour may be changed, and memory, emotions, and thethinking process may be influenced by remote control.”Want a lone assassin? No problem. Want an Israeli to kill a groupof Arabs in an attempt to demolish peace talks? No problem. Wantsome guy to go into a school with a gun and start killing children tomanipulate public opinion into demanding an armed or moreauthoritarian police force? Want to destroy the credibility of a groupor organisation which threatens you by making one of its members dosomething terrible or ridiculous? No problem. We at the House ofMind Control can cater to your every desire. Why is it that most ofthe ‘lone assassins’ are made out to be mentally deranged or ‘nutters’.Who, or what, makes them like that? This is how John Lennon waskilled. He threatened the Brotherhood with his promotion of peace,love, the eternal nature of the spirit, and his inspiration to the young.He was murdered by a mind-controlled attacker. If you don’t want tomake a big public show of it, there is always the drug-induced heartattack or brain haemorrhage.Nor is this confined to the United States. An investigation inSweden revealed that for the last twenty-five years doctors there havebeen using patients for on-going mind experimentation. They havebeen implanting transmitters into the brains of patients to use themlike laboratory animals. The control of which Delgado speaks waspossible in the 1950s and no doubt long before that."},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"224Today, the Brotherhood, thanks to its secret scientific research, havethe ability for mass mind control. They have perfected the use ofmicrowave pulses carrying instructions which can control individual orcollective behaviour. Both the Americans and the Russians can do this.This knowledge of ‘psychic attack’ has been passed on over thecenturies through the Brotherhood. An issue of the newsletter,‘Tactical Technology’, in 1993 reported the latest developments inRussian technology of this kind. The report was about a visit to Russiain November 1991 of Janet Morris, the Research Director of the USGlobal Strategy Council, a think tank in Washington DC, founded bythe former CIA Deputy Director, Ray Cline:“Morris and other members of a team sent to investigate Russiantechnologies for commercial development were invited to ademonstration of a mind control technology. A volunteer from the USteam sat down in front of a computer screen as innocuous wordsflashed across the screen. The volunteer was only required to tellwhich words he liked and which he disliked. At the end of thedemonstration the Russian staff started revealing the sensitive,innermost, thoughts of the volunteer - none of which had beenpreviously discussed....... The Russians told Morris of ademonstration in which a group of workers were outside the hospitalworking in the grounds. The staff sent an acoustic psycho-correctionmessage via their machine to the workers telling them to put downtheir tools, knock on the door of the hospital and ask if there wasanything else they could do. The workers did exactly that, theRussians said.“The Russians admitted to using this technology for specialoperations team selection and performance enhancement and to aidtheir Olympic athletes and an Antarctic exploration team. Being aninfra-sound, very low frequency-type transmission, the acoustic-correction message is transmitted via bone conduction. This meansthat earplugs will not restrict the message. An entire body protectionunit system would be required to stop reception. The message,according to the Russians, by-passes the conscious level and is actedupon with exposure times of under one minute. Morris envisions thistechnology will be miniaturised into a hand-held device. Presently theInternational Healthline Corporation is planning to bring a team ofspecialists to the US in the near future to further demonstrate thecapability.”"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"225Want the British Cabinet, the House of Commons, the US President orCongress to come to decisions that suit you? No problem. Want toencourage civil wars and the most unspeakable behaviour to furtherjustify a world army and government? And what if you want stockmarkets to react as you wish them to? When you look at this, it givesnew meaning to the phrase: ‘Forgive them, they know not what they do.’There is another sinister aspect to this that we must resist witheverything we have. Everything about us is already kept on computer,and now the Brotherhood want to go a stage further and have ouractions totally under their control. Once again they are trying to do thiscovertly under the cover of a ‘reasoned’ suggestion to help us. Howkind they are. We are now hearing of the growth in credit card fraudand how something must be done so people can be identified moreeasily. What will be suggested is some kind of bar coding on eachperson - like they use on the goods in the supermarket - and in this waythe authorities will know where we are, and what we are doing at alltimes. It would also be used to transmit messages to us like thecomputers and robots we would then be. They are already leading up tothis by doing it with animals, and we are next if we allow it to happen.The Mann Humane Society in America explained the technique in anarticle by one of its public relations associates:“For nearly a year, the Marin Humane Society has been implantingevery dog and cat adopted from the shelter with a micro-chip ID, ahigh-tech answer to the age old problem of permanently identifyingyour beloved pet. The micro-chip, about the size of an uncooked grainof rice, is encased in biomedical grade glass. The chip is imprinted witha ten-digit alphanumeric code and is implanted by simple injectionbetween the animals shoulder blades. With the wave of a hand-heldscanner, the chip is activated to transmit the code to a computer whichprovides the owner’s name and address, any relevant medicalinformation and, most importantly, the owner’s phone number.”The Brotherhood of the New World Order want to go further thanthat with humans. They want us bar-coded so we can be ‘read’ atsupermarkets and banks, like a checkout assistant now reads a tin ofbeans. A man at IBM who invented the lazer-bar reader forsupermarkets has also developed a method of putting the same typeof device under human skin in one billionth of a second.

We could be permanently linked to acomputer, and who is to say that signals could not be sent both ways?Six thousand people in Sweden have already accepted a mark ontheir hands as part of an experiment into a cashless society, and trialshave also started in Japan.Micro-chip implants are being inserted into people duringabductions. They now want to dupe everyone into accepting itlegally. Their ideal is to have every new born baby implanted as thenormal course of events. They will use the excuse of medicine (thismicro-chip will re-programme the body to fight disease), of findingmissing people Oust think your child need never be lost again), and astring of other reasons. Each one might sound very reasonable initself, but look at the hidden agenda. Don’t let it happen!Nor is electromagnetic and high technology limited to mindcontrol. Its use is causing catastrophic damage to the physical bodyand the environment, besides being perfected for military use. Ournon-physical selves are a series of interacting, electromagneticenergy fields, so we are affected at the core of our being by otherelectromagnetic fields. And if the etheric level is affected, thephysical body malfunctions. For reasons of mind control and tocreate more efficient weapons system, waves of electromagneticpulses are being generated across the world by particularly theUnited States. The US Omega Network, with stations in Nor-way,Argentina, Hawaii, Japan, Liberia, La Reunion Island, Australia, andthe US are sending out low frequency ground waves as part of anuclear weapons response system. These ground waves are causingill effects for those who live in the area and for the Earth’s energyfield. The Omega Network is only part of the mass ofelectromagnetic frequencies being emitted for reasons ofweaponryand control. These are responsible for an enormous number ofcancers, cataracts, genetic defects, and mental illness. Robert BeckerMD, an author and specialist in electromagnetic pollution, quoted inthe incomparable Nexus Magazine, said this:“All abnormal man-made electromagnetic fields, regardless of theirfrequencies, produce the same biological effects. These effects, whichdeviate from normal functions and are actually or potentially harmful,are the following:“Effects on growing cells, such as increases in the rate of cancercell division; increases in the incidence of certain cancers;"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"227developmental abnormalities in embryos; alterations inneurochemicals, resulting in behavioural abnormalities such assuicide; alterations in biological cycles; decline in immune-systemefficiency; alterations in learning ability.”It is this electromagnetic pollution that is the overwhelming cause ofthe dying forests, and while atmospheric pollution is terrible, this isused as a front for the main killer. But one Brotherhood technique isto use the threat to the environment as a justification for promotingthe coordination powers of a world government.Throughout the decades since 1945, the CIA and other intelligenceagencies on the Brotherhood network have been covertly working toincrease conflict and control. The Suez ‘crisis’ in the 1950s was anexample of how the Allies even dupe each other. ExCIA man MilesCopeland tells in his autobiography of how the British PrimeMinister, Anthony Eden, became so obsessed with removing Egypt’sPresident Nasser after he had nationalised the Suez Canal, that theUS Secretary of State expected to be asked any day by the British toagree an assassination plot. This would have been rather difficult forthe Americans because they were supporting Nasser and hoping hewould help to reduce the influence of Islam. As Copeland points out:“At this time, the CIA station chief received a message from [CIADirector] Allen Dulles himself, sent at the insistence of his brother,[the Secretary of State], directing us to examine ways in which, ifpush came to shove, Nasser could be killed.“There was a negative tone to the message which implied that theDulles brothers would welcome a carefully thought out reply to theeffect that Nasser was invulnerable, but we were not, of course, tomention the fact that we were the reason he was out of reach ofwould-be assassins since we had ourselves designed the securityarrangements around him. “......And now I must make an even more arresting admission.While the ‘straights’ in Washington were increasingly displeased withthe anti-American content of Nasser’s public utterances and the anti-American propaganda that poured out of Radio Cairo, the MiddleEast’s most far reaching voice, can you guess who was writing agoodly portion of the material? We were. We understood, as Nasserdid at that time, the new regime’s hold on the country depended on itsbeing consistently and convincingly anti-American, and that Nasser"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"228couldn’t even risk an indication of reasonableness towards ourvarious Middle East policies..... We took pains to make it counter-productive, of course, and we included a lot of patent nonsense, butwe kept virtually in control of its production.”With the above in mind, look again at the anti-American speeches ofSaddam Hussein at the time of the Gulf War in 1991. There can neverhave been a more obviously orchestrated conflict than that. TheAmericans made it plain to Saddam that if he went into Kuwait theywould not react. He went in and they reacted. On 25th July 1990,Saddam met with the US Ambassador, April Gillespie, after he had toldthe Arab nations and the Soviet Union that he intended to invadeKuwait! They did not object. According to cables released in July 1991,Gillespie deliberately misled Sad-dam who believed that the US took thesame view. She was acting under instructions from the White House.The then-president Bush seemed content to use sanctions at first, butsuddenly over a short period US forces began to arrive in largenumbers. The United Nations gave the US ‘permission’ to attackSaddam under their flag and, with support from countries like Britainand France, they unleashed their macho men on the Iraqis. The USwere keenly supported by Saudi Arabia, the birthplace of Islam, wherethe Saudi branch of freemasonry is largely based at the US oilcompany, Aramco. When the American (sorry), UN forces had theIraqis in disarray and could have moved on to take Baghdad to removethe dictator they claimed to hate so bitterly, they stopped. Why?Because they didn’t want Saddam removed, he was too useful wherehe was - if; indeed, the real Saddam was still alive by then. I’m notconvinced that the man who is now claimed to be Saddam is the sameperson that we saw before he ‘disappeared’ for so long through andafter the war.Some channelled information I was given a few days ahead of theGulf conflict said:..... There is no way to appease the situation as only a few know thetruth of the real situation. Here we have a war of economics, money,materialism, but most of all greed. The monies do not go to thepeople, but into the coffers of only a few because of corruption andsecrecy. As the walls fall on the economic crisis so will dishonestycome to light. It will involve those that you trust as well as those youdo not trust.”"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"229The ‘victory’ over Saddam was portrayed as the effectiveness of theUnited Nations, and what a benefit a UN (Brotherhood) army couldbe. Once again the media poodle wagged its tail through the GulfWar period, and whenever you read a paper or see a news bulletin,remember above all else that nothing is ever what it seems to be.The plan for world domination continues apace across the planettoday as the secret armies are trained and prepared with governmentfunding behind fake names and fake projects. One of these in theUnited States is called the Federal Emergency Management Agency(FEMA). This has a budget of billions of dollars, and yet it wasn’teven created under constitutional law. It is the result of a PresidentialExecutive Order. In 1935, the Emergency Management Act waspassed to give the President the right to by-pass Congress and makelaws in times of national emergency. Fair enough, you might think.Sometimes you have to act quickly when there’s an emergency. Thelittle point they don’t tell you is that there is always officially a stateof national emergency in the United States! This gives the Presidentpowers to make laws whenever he wishes, and have them ready andwaiting for the time when they can all be implemented at once. Youmight like to know that these executive orders passed since 1935have given the President the power to do the following, whenever hedecides there is increased international tension or economic crisis:To take over all transport, roads, and ports; all media; thepower industries; food production and farms; all aircraft;relocate communities and mobilise people into work brigadesunder government supervision; start a national registrationscheme.The list goes on, and when a state of emergency is declared by thePresident, Congress cannot challenge it for at least six months.“He (the President) will have the right to propose temporary laws,and even new departures in the government constitutional working,the pretext both for the one and other being the requirements for thesupreme welfore of the State......“We shall invest in the president the right to declare a state of war.We shall justify this last right on the ground that the president aschief of the whole army of the country must have it at his disposal forthe defence of the..... constitution.” (Illuminati Protocol 10)."},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"230FEMA came into being this way. It was started by..... ZbigniewBrzezinski; remember him? He started the Tn-Lateral Commissionwith Rockefeller money, and served as National Security Advisor forthe first Tri-Lateralist President, Jimmy Carter. Brzezinski stayed onafter Carter’s defeat, to continue his work with FEMA under RonaldReagan. FEMA’s public face is presented as an organisation thatreacts to national emergencies -everything from a nuclear attack to anearthquake or an urban riot. Strange then, you might think, that onlysix percent of its budget is spent on national emergencies. The rest isused to construct underground facilities for the government in time of‘foreign or domestic’ emergency, and to build ‘holding facilities’,prisons and ‘refugee facilities’, none of which have ever been usedfor such purposes. So why are they building them? FEMA has around3,600 employees, and yet only sixty work on natural disasters orprepare plans in case of nuclear attack. What are the rest doing?Two familiar names were in charge of FEMA for a number ofyears: General Richard Secord and Colonel Oliver North, whoworked with the CIA and US Air Force to smuggle weapons in whatbecame known as the Iran-Contra Affair. FEMA is another major armof the secret government. One of its aims is to disarm the Americanpeople. Now, I’m all for getting rid of weapons of all kinds, but againyou need to look at the motives behind it. If you are planning atakeover, a coup against what passes for a democratic order, then it ismuch easier if the population is unarmed. And what do you need tojustify laws taking away the public’s right to own a gun underAmerican law? More violent, high profile crime. Exactly what youneed to justify the arming of police forces like those of Britain, whichhave not carried arms as a matter of course in the past. Incidentally,the American Gun Control Act of 1968 is word for word the NaziGun Control Law of 1938.Another branch of the secret government working with FEMA isthe Multi-Jurisdictional Task Force (MJTF), which was started byPresident George Bush. Bill Clinton talks of the need for a nationalpolice force when he already has one. The MJTF is now in almost allAmerican states, and its role is house-to-house searches, the seizureand ‘categorising’ of men, women and children, and their transfer todetention centres (built by FEMA, remember), and the interrogationof these people. We are talking about concentration camps here,ladies and gentlemen. Twenty-three such camps were authorisedoriginally and another twenty were allowed for under the 1990-91"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"231military budget. The MJTF recruits from urban street gangs, who arenow allowed to do legally what they have been doing illegally formost of their lives, to enter homes, take possessions etc. They are toostupid to see that they are being used, and that they will be removedtoo, when their purpose is served.The third element in this triangle is the Financial CrimeEnforcement Network (FINCEN). This is made up mostly of peoplefrom overseas police forces and military, particularly European.FINCEN in Montana has a number of Gurkas in its ranks. They havethousands of helicopters and other aircraft at their disposal, which areappropriately painted black. Many times, black helicopters have beenseen near the occurrence of cattle mutilations which are said to be thework of ETs. FINCEN personnel are trained to land, do their darkdeeds, and then disappear into the sky very quickly. TheBrotherhood-controlled United Nations is supporting and helping tocoordinate these operations. All it takes is one major manufactured‘crisis’, and the starting gun fires. Goodbye democracy, or whatclaims to be democracy. I understand the plans for the takeover of theUnited States are now well advanced. Part of this is for Michigan, forinstance, to become known as ‘Area 5’, with its capital as Chicagoand its governor appointed by the President without thecomplications of an election. One p05sible ‘emergency’ to set off thischain of events could be that of a terrorist with a nuclear weapon,threatening to destroy the United States. Watch for such a deceit,because something like this will be used to justify the coup in its firststages, if it gets that far.These covert preparations for the New World Order are notconfined to the United States. They are happening in all the majorcountries, with most of the politicians having no idea of what isgoing on behind their backs, or what the money they are allocating isreally being spent on. In Britain the laws are getting more sinisterevery year. The Department of Transport pays security firms andprivate investigators to identify those who protest peacefully againstroad projects that destroy the environment, and it sends innocentpeople to prison for the crime of trying to stop this madness of takingthe human race out of existence. We must challenge this byprotesting in even greater numbers. They can’t arrest us all!It is difficult to know exactly what is going on today, becausewhenever information is released into the public domain you can besure that it has already been superseded.

I would not stake my life on every detail, but Iwould on the themes. Throughout the process of my spiritualawakening I have been left in no doubt when I am being guided to anarea of knowledge that needs to be made public. Suddenlyinformation on a specific subject comes in from all directions, andnever more so than with the New World Order. I had only vaguelyheard of the term until, over a period of three weeks, all theinformation about it in this book was put into my hands by a varietyof different people. Those on the higher levels who are guiding mewanted this information put in the book, and made available to thepublic.It really doesn’t matter whether you believe ETs are involved ornot. The outcome is the same - a covert attempt to take over theworld by duping the mass of the population and ‘removing’ thosewho refuse to play ball. That’s the simple fact we all need to keepfocussed on. The Brotherhood will not succeed ultimately, becausethe transformation of consciousness now unfolding will sweep theirplans away eventually. They may use a lot of twisted Egyptianmythology to justify their ambitions, but they should remember thatin those stories Horus, the son, defeats Set in the final battle. So itwill be. But what the Lucifer - (Set) - controlled Brotherhood can dois make the transition far more difficult, painful and traumatic, andhold back the spiritual awakening of millions of people.They are using the increasing violence and conflict, the collapsingglobal economy and the threat to the environment - all of which theyare, to a large extent, causing - to hookwink the people into thenightmare of a world government, world central bank, worldcurrency, world army, and global control. Perhaps waiting in thewings is the claim that the planet is in imminent danger of an alieninvasion. This could well be the card they are preparing to play tocoerce a terrified population into willingly handing over all thecentralised power the Brotherhood desire. I have noticed thatsuddenly the media is full of ‘alien abduction’ stories and such like,and information is being released into the public arena about ‘aliens’on perhaps a bigger scale than ever before.

I have merely sought to pick out certain key themeswhich, I feel, will help us to end the violence, destruction, and thecontrol behind it.Most people who have been incarnate on the planet over thesethousands of years were not, as individuals, all murdering,persecuting bigots. I am the first to say that, and I stress it again now.Most lived their lives in the best way they could within the confinesof this dense physical form and the limitations of the world aroundthem. Most do not come into incarnation to cause suffering, that isnot their intention. They want to serve the planet, not destroy her. Butonce we incarnate we can become like dodgem cars in a fairground,hooked up to the same thought patterns and, to varying degrees, withthe Luciferic consciousness at the wheel.I remember my friend Yeva having a psychic vision once when Iwas with her that gave some idea of what it must be like waiting toincarnate. She saw millions of people being told about what washappening here and how best to remember who they were afterincarnation. The overwhelming feeling she had during this visionwas the frustration of these beings. They knew what needed to bedone on the Earth, but they also knew that after incarnation thepressures were such that they were likely to act in the samedestructive ways as those currently in dense physical bodies.Before we become consumed by guilt over all that has happenedthrough human history, we should remember that this is a tough placeto be at the moment, and has been for a long time. When I highlightthe destructive behaviour of humans over these thousands of years Iam not judging or condemning individuals. I am challenging thethought patterns, imbalances, and downright mind control that havemotivated that behaviour. The Augustines, Jeromes, Hitlers, and"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"236sundry popes, are victims also. It is their thought patterns I challengeand seek to expose, not them as eternal beings. I have given thisnegative force a symbolic name, Lucifer, for simplicity, but really itis an extreme imbalance which we can all be subject to if we let ourvalues drop. This is not, however, humanity’s natural state. I sayagain: We are intrinsically good, not evil. It is the unique density ofthis planet and the severe negative influences that are behind ouractions, and the only way we can change that is to think for ourselvesand synchronise with our higher levels. Accepting that those levelsexist is the first and most important step we can take.One thing is very clear from the patterns addressed by the book sofar. Whenever we have had the free flow of all information into thepublic arena and everyone has respected another’s right to interpretthat information in ways that feel right to them, human evolution hassurged ahead. Whenever the free flow of information has beenstemmed and doctored and one belief system imposed, humanevolution has stopped or declined. We need to keep this at theforefront of our thinking as we search for ways to build a fair andbalanced world in the years to come.To some people it may appear that I see a conspiracy behind everycorner, but I don’t. I am a great believer in the ‘cock-up factor’ ofhistory, too, and not every event is the Brotherhood at work. But Ihave been trying to chart a path through the last twenty thousandyears or so, to pick out common links and connections. This has ledme, and growing numbers of others around the world, to believe thatthere is indeed a central conspiracy of manipulation which threads itsway through human history. When I look at all the coincidences thathappened in a few weeks to present me with information about thisconspiracy before the book was completed, it is clear that other levelsof consciousness want people to know that there is some seriousstring-pulling going on, and it is time that the puppeteers wereexposed. They can’t control events if we will not cooperate. We havethe power, not they, if only we could recognise it.What I hope I have succeeded in doing in the first half of the bookis to highlight the following:(1)That over thousands of years a Brotherhood of secretsocieties has emerged which has been used to manipulate humanityin the most fundamental and horrific ways, and that its goal of worlddictatorship is planned to be imposed in our lifetimes.(2)That extra-terrestrials have probably had a fundamental"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"237impact on human evolution.(3)That far from civilising the world, Christianity and otherdogmatic, imposed, religions have held back our evdlution for atleast two thousand years.(4)That the free flow of all information and knowledge is thepath to freedom and understanding, a fact confirmed by the constantexamples of Church and political dictatorships destroying alternativeviews to their dogma and control.(5)That the ills of the world have been overwhelmingly causedby the great majority allowing themselves to be blindly led by thefew.(6)That the belief that anyone has a monopoly on truth andwisdom is probably the most destructive and stupid belief it ispossible to have.(7)That to believe our dense-physical bodies are superior toanother race or culture is, along with religion and greed, the cause ofalmost every war and conflict experienced by humankind.(8)That the virtue of forgiveness really is the only way we aregoing to break the cycles of vengeance and revenge.I’d like to expand on those last three points. Our belief that thephysical body is ‘us’ in total has to change if we are to be set freefrom these cycles. It is this belief that leads people to seek revenge inthis life for what was done to the ancestral line of their bodieshundreds and even thousands of years ago, when the body is merelythe vehicle for their consciousness to experience this dense physicalworld. It is like two people in different spacesuits on the Moonhaving a fight because cf what two other spacemen did to each otherwhile wearing the same kind of spacesuits years before. We wouldsay that was crazy and yet look at Northern Ireland, the Middle East,the former Yugoslavia, and so on and that, in effect, is what they aredoing. Only by recognising this can it be stopped. This is one reasonwhy the Illuminati have worked so hard to keep the spiritual truthsfrom the mass of the people, and it is vital that this suppressedknowledge as set out in this book be widely known. Even then thisunderstanding has to be wider and more mature than belief systemslike Hinduism which uses karma and reincarnation to justify somehorrific behaviour. Also, giving responsibility for our actions tosomeone else is like handing over a lethal weapon. Once we look toothers to lead us and tell us what to do and think we are building the"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"238foundations of all the violence, pain, and suffering I havedocumented.The great majority of those who persecuted non-believers ordifferent believers actually thought they were carrying out the wishesof God. They had allowed themselves to be so mind-controlled thatwhatever they were told was God’s command they followed to theletter. No-one would have persuaded them they were doing anythingwrong. They were people of their time, controlled by the beliefsystem programmed into them. Today it’s still the same with billionsof people mind controlled to think the way the brotherhood demandsand they ridicule, condemn, and even murder those who challenge itsnonsenses and control. What is the difference, except in backgroundand scale, between that and the horrors of religious and politicalpersecution in the past? Both are the result of the same non-thinking,the same robotic responses, and the desire to pass responsibility tothink and act to others. What makes it most effective for the forces ofdestruction is that people who don’t think are persuaded that they do.Nothing is more dangerous than a closed mind that thinks it’s open. Itis the ultimate illusion, and yet I meet people like that every day.We have lurched from extreme to extreme over most of the lasttwelve thousand years and more because we have not, collectively,had the humility to appreciate that we do not know it all, or evennearly so. There is no way we will balance all knowledge andunderstanding while one group thinks it has all the answers and theothers think the same. We had the Roman Catholic Church thatpersecuted non-believers because it believed itself to have the truth;then came the Protestants who persecuted Roman Catholics for thesame reason; then the Protestants broke up into factions caused bythe minutest of difference between them, and they persecuted eachother because each believed they had the truth; then camematerialistic science which proceeded to marginalise and condemnthose in its own profession who challenged the this-world-is-all-there-is dogma. Each faction and dogma decides it has the truth,builds an empire of income and influence, and defends that againstall comers, especially if they bring new knowledge to question thestatus quo. This mentality sees the preservation of privilege throughthe status quo as far more important than the advancement of humanunderstanding. Whoever has their hands on the wheel seeks to keepeveryone else out of the vehicle.The ‘ba ba’ mentality in which the masses do as the few, even"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"239sometimes the one, tells them is at the heart of the control of thehuman consciousness. Divide and rule is the great truism. How can itbe that one or a small group of people have controlled millions in thecountries and empires of human existence? What was that Gandhisaid? ‘100,000 Englishmen cannot control 300 million Indians ifthose Indians will not co-operate.’ Instead whole civilisations havegone ‘ba ba’ and followed the leader of the herd. Or they haveallowed themselves to be offered privileges by the dictator, be it aman, woman, or system, and ignored the injustices their fellowhumans suffer. That is plainly true of the world today. But Iremember what Pastor Niemoeller, a victim of the Nazis, said:“First they came for the Communists and I did not speak outbecause I was not a Communist. Then they came for the tradeunionists and I did not speak out because I was not a trade unionist.Then they came for me and there was no-one left to speak out for me.”If we ignore injustice against others we are just as responsible asthose who directly cause that injustice. Again as Gandhi said:‘Silence is connivance’. It is time to let the divisions fall away andstand up for each other. They might be able to imprison, kill, ordiscredit a few who say enough is enough, but they can’t do it tomillions standing side by side together. Power is only the ability topersuade one group of people that you have power over them. Poweris an illusion and is shown to be so when all people stand togetherand peacefully say no, this is not right and not acceptable.Running through all these themes across the centuries of humanexistence is the need for revenge.. If anything this is the mostdestructive of all emotions. We all feel it instinctively when we feelsomeone has treated us unfairly. That is understandable within thepressures of this planet. Many times in my life when people haveacted negatively towards me, I have had a wish to pay them back.Sometimes that feeling still flows through me when somethinghappens that I feel particularly strongly about. But we need to take abreath and think before we react instinctively looking for revenge. Ifyou do that and look at the wider consequences this destructivedesire for revenge can be dispersed. It doesn’t mean you don’t stillfeel hurt, but the need to punish those you believe responsible isreleased.This is so important, I cannot stress it enough. As Chief Seattle"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"240said:“when our young men grow angry at some real or imaginary wrongand disfigure their faces with black paint, their hearts, also, aredisfigured and turn black. Then their cruelty is relentless and knowsno bounds. Our old men are not able to restrain them. True it is thatrevenge is considered gain, even at the cost of their own lives, but oldmen who stay at home in times of war, and old women who have sonsto lose, know better.”What we have seen so far in the book are cycles of vengeance andrevenge. The cycle of one persecuting the other and the need forrighting that wrong by further, often greater, persecution in return.Mostly it is the innocent who suffer not the persecutors. Not everyPuritan wanted to persecute those of another faith, nor every RomanCatholic, or Anglican. But they were still the victims of the other sidewhen they came back for revenge. Unless we forgive our enemies,including the Illuminati, we cannot possibly break these cycles ofhuman and planetary pain and destruction because the lust forrevenge will go on. Forgiveness may appear to be an old and familiartheme, but wisdom is not new. It is as old as Creation itsel£Forgiveness has, and always will be, the key to human progress. Iwould not claim for one second that it is easy in the circumstances inwhich we find ourselves, but it remains the only way. If we are tobuild the new World, a task we will discuss in Part Two, we will onlystep out of the cycles of darkness if we forgive each other, rejectmind control, and refuse to be sheep led by human, extra-terrestrialor misguided non-physical shepherds.It is time to open our eyes and our hearts and take responsibility forour thoughts and actions. It is time to wake up and grow up.

The ‘volunteer’ babies born in thoseimmediate post war years were, however, the biggest influx of thosewho had chosen to be at the cutting edge of change andtransformation. To quote a channelled message from TruthVibrations:“Those of you who are at the forefront of this, you are rather like asnowplough. You are the thin end of the wedge. You really have, howshall I put this? To a certain extent, I suppose, you have the shitty endof the job. You have got to do an awful lot, but nevertheless you arecapable of doing an awful lot. That is why you have chosen to come,that is what you are hear for, to really shovel some shit, and thereforemake some space behind you to make it easier for the others.”I should point out that when thought forms from higher levels aredecoded by the lower self and the brain they are often spoken andwritten in the channeller’s own style. While some would say youhave come to remove the negative domination, others would say youhave come to shovel some shit. Either way, the volunteers who haveincarnated to be alive at this time - not only the post war babies byany means - are here to play their part in changing humanconsciousness by returning it to its natural state of love, peace,compassion, and wisdom. The volunteers task is to help the planet soshe can heal herself; to remove the brotherhood domination, and toleave the babies and young children of today with a clear run tocreate a new world without the Luciferic influence to trouble them."},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"245The volunteers are being supported by a vast network of highlyevolved entities on other frequencies and by extraterrestrials whowish to free the planet from those who have other, less laudable,ambitions for the human race. It is sorting out time. The volunteersare being guided to complete three main tasks:(1) To raise human consciousness by passing on information thatopens the mind and helps people to remember what they alreadyknow deep down about the nature of life, Creation, and the currenttransformation. This helps them to re-synchronise with their higherselves and access more of their eternal knowledge.(2) To repair the energy grid and prepare the Atlantean system forthe time to come soon, when it replaces the temporary system thathas been in operation over the thousands of years since then. Thisinvolves the re-activation of the harmonic keys which will unlockthose incredibly powerful energies which were turned down, or off;at the end of Atlantis, as symbolised in the King Arthur legends.(3) To channel energies into the Earth that will balance out thesevere negative domination in her energy field caused by all thenegativity generated by the pain, conflict, and violence documentedin this book.In this chapter I will look at some of the ways this is being done,how everyone can help, and the sort of effects we can expect in oureveryday lives. Energies are being channelled into the grid byvolunteers who are collectively known as Light Workers. Anyone cando this as I explain in my book, Heal the World. It is not an exclusiveclub for the chosen ones. There are no ‘chosen’ ones, only people.Energy passes through their energy fields and physical bodies and istransformed into a frequency the Earth can absorb. On theseoccasions the human body becomes like an acupuncture needle forthe planet, channelling and balancing energy flows. Since myconscious awakening in 1990, I have been all over the UnitedKingdom and to many parts of the world doing this, places like Peru,Bolivia, Ecuador, Chile, Colombia, the United States, Italy, Egypt,Israel, Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark, Ireland, and France. Ihave had some amazing experiences along the way as I recount in myautobiography, In The Light Of Experience. Tens of thousands areknowingly doing this work and millions, unknowingly.These energies which are coming in to raise the frequency of theEarth’s energy field are, to a large extent, the Photon Beam Imentioned in the early part of the book. The orbit of the Solar System"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"246is taking us back across the Photon Beam, the rebalancing beam ofhighly charged particles which offers the chance for those who areready to raise themselves to a higher frequency. The Earth Spirit, theenergy field of the planet, is due to do just that. The period of theopportunity for the Luciferic consciousness is coming to an end andit will have to wait until another opportunity is offered either byhumanity or another consciousness stream. It is reckoned to take2,000 years for the Earth to cross the beam and so all this won’thappen tomorrow, but major changes are upon us. Entering the beamis like crossing the light cast by a lighthouse or torch beam. You enterin the more diffused, weaker, light first and then you go on to passacross the centre where the light is most powerful. I believe thatsometime in the last century the Earth began to move into thediffused ‘light’ of the Photon Beam and by the 1960s it was havingan obvious effect on those who were open to it. You don’t have toopen yourself to it and the changes it is creating in the energy field ofthe planet. There is no compulsion, but there are consequences.Many people, especially the young, tuned to these energies in the1960s and it manifested as the period known as ‘Flower Power’.Energy is consciousness and the energies carried the information andknowledge which inspired the values behind the sixties phenomenon.If you listen to much of the flower power music and the protest songsof that time, you will hear the themes of vibrations - good, bad, andchanging vibrations - of love for all, and of the times they are achanging. All three reflect a knowledge of what is happening in thistime of the Great Awakening of humankind. Through the 1970s andthe ’80s as the brotherhood pulled in the other direction and soughtto destroy such thinking, we still saw the rise of environmentalawareness, the growth in animal welfare movements, ofvegetarianism, and explosions of human compassion like Live Aid.Now, in the 1990s as we move further on into the beam, wake uptime is upon us as the rebalancmg of the Earth’s energy field helps usto re-connect with higher levels of ourselves and so become ‘whole’.I meet people all the time who have suddenly awakened and begunto see the world in a new light. They cannot understand why theycould not see before what is now obvious to them. But the reason issimple. Earlier in their lives they were working mostly through theconscious level only, that part of us which is subject to the severelimitations of the dense physical body. This can, and mostly is,programmed by the messages it constantly receives through the eyes"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"247and the ears in this Lucifer-controlled world and we can believe someridiculous things. When we reconnect with all levels, our perceptionsreflect the guidance of our higher wisdom and understanding and wesee what a daft world we live in. When this re-connection happens itcan be like a dam bursting as knowledge and information floods intothe conscious level and it can be a traumatic time as you try to makesense of what is happening to you and your life. I have written aboutthis in Heal The World.The higher we can all raise our own vibratory state by thinking,searching, and seeking truth, wisdom, love and understanding, thehigher the vibrations that can be passed through us into the Earth andthe quicker we remove the Luciferic domination. A channelledcommunication in Truth Vibrations explained something of this.Speaking of the energies switched off in the latter days of Atlantis, itsaid:“As the energies around your planet quicken, so these latentenergies which have been withdrawn will be phased back in. They willgradually be awakened. As the consciousness of your planet raisesitself those of you Light Workers who are working together to raiseyour consciousness, you will be able to hold more and more refinedvibrations, and so we will be able to use you as a catalyst to be ableto feed in more and more energies. As more of you raise yourconsciousness, so we can awaken more of these energies.”The books on the subject, the talks, the media interviews, thediscussions with friends, and the energy channelling are all helpingto awaken people and raise the frequency of the energy field. Most ofthe awakening is being triggered by energy changes on the non-physical levels, and even when I speak I can feel energy pouringthrough me to the audience and vice versa. That is where the mostimportant interchange is going on. But words, written and spoken,are also an energy and they can be extremely powerful in gettinginformation to the conscious level to challenge the programming.With every person who changes his or her thinking, we are anotherstep nearer to that point when the power of such understanding isstrong enough in the collective mind of humanity for that to becomeavailable to everyone, as in the hundredth monkey syndrome. It is inthe collective mind that Lucifer is being challenged most powerfully.I believe we are getting close to that ‘critical mass’ when the"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"248collective mind begins to be a source of positive rather than negativeinfluence upon we ‘individuals’ who are connected to it. When thathappens we will see people change with a speed that will beggarbelie£But I am not suggesting this time of change will be easy foranyone. Those who have come here to be at the sharp end of thistransformation have often been ‘tested’ to the very limits of theirendurance, especially on the emotional level. This has been designedto unleash all their inner emotional and mental strength and courage.Now is the time when all that has been experienced in previousphysical lifetimes will have to be called upon because the Lucifericconsciousness and its expressions through the economic, political,military and industrial establishment is not going to go quietly. Buthave no fear that it is going to go. It is already on the way. Peoplewho are awakening are finding themselves at odds with the society inwhich they live, and even within their families, too. As they expandtheir consciousness, they are accessing higher levels of knowledge,wisdom, and understanding. Those with the courage to outwardlyexpress how they feel are challenging conventional thinking andbehaviour of almost every kind. They are called anything from‘loony’ to ‘dangerous’ by those still mesmerised by the physicalworld. The Luciferic consciousness works hard to undermine them,just as it did 2,000 years ago and on so many other occasions throughhistory. But it will not succeed.What will happen - is happening - is that the numbers opening upto these changes will go on increasing until they are the majority.Those who resist will eventually go out of incarnation and continuetheir evolution on a level suitable to their current state of being. Theywon’t cease to exist because we all live forever, but they will nolonger be able to live on this planet as her frequency moves wellbehind theirs. Around the planet is a frequency range. As this rises,some of the lower frequencies fall out of the range. You could thinkof it as like climbing a ladder. With each higher rung that your handsreach, your feet are leaving others behind. The consciousness stilltuned to those lower ‘rungs’ as the Earth moves on will be affected inmany ways. Their vibratory rate will be falling out of synchronisationwith the planet’s energy field in which they live. This will affect theirbehaviour, their mental and emotional stability, and their physicalhealth.These will consist of the Brotherhood and the people still clinging"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"249on to the old order. This will create tensions between those wishingto bring change and freedom of lifestyle and expression, and thosewho want to resist the inevitable by trying to force people to conformto old structures. For those with closed minds who cling on to thestatus quo the time will come when the vibratory gap between themand the planet will be so wide they will go out of incarnation. Theeffects on their behaviour will add to the negative aspects of thistransition period and it is up to everyone to help them with love andunderstanding. I would stress, though, that not everyone who leavestheir physical shell in the years ahead will be suffering from theeffects of vibratory change. Many will be moving on at the momentthey always planned, their experience in this incarnation completed.But those who are going with the changes and those who are not willbecome clearer with every month from now on. In Heal The World, Ihave suggested ways in which we can increase the speed of thistuning in process by healing ourselves and the planet. For have nodoubt, healing ourselves, loving and forgiving ourselves, is the onlyway we will heal the Earth and allow the Earth to heal us. Healingourselves spiritually and emotionally changes the nature of theenergies we generate into the world. Love is the most powerful of allenergy. Love is the answer.The vibratory changes, hastened at certain times by particularastrological alignments, will affect the whole world. Nothing and no-one will be the same again. Everything is the same consciousness indifferent states of being. So if that consciousness is changing in ourpart of Creation it must affect everything - the way we think; ouremotions; our bodies; the physical Earth; the weather; and, for thosewho choose to resist these changes to the end, even their ability tostay in incarnation. A channelled message in 1990 spoke of theimplications for relationships and attitudes. These themes are clear inthe letters I receive and the people I meet:“I feel now you are sensing the energies coming in, the energiessurrounding your planet. This is causing many of you to askquestions. It is causing many of you to re-evaluate completely yourway of life, where you feel you wish to go, what you want to do. It iscausing tremendous upheavals. Some of these are very confusing, verydistressing, very disturbing. Some people in relationships are findingthey can no longer continue in those relationships because theirpartners cannot tune in to what they have been tuning into. It is"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"250causing a great deal ofdisturbance. And I have said to this sensitive(channeller) on more than one occasion that you must organiseyourselves into groups to support each other..”Even some long standing relationships are ending as one partnerchooses to take the spiritual path and the other does not. People whohave always had so much in common are suddenly like strangers toeach other. They are literally on different wavelengths. Once onepartner begins to react to the changes and go with them, the urgings oftheir inner self will be far more powerful than their desire to protect arelationship, much as they may love their partner. Some will leave forlong periods to follow their path, others will part for good. But whenboth partners choose to follow the frequencies, their relationship willgrow stronger and evolve to a new level and understanding of love. Isee the nature of relationships and family situations changing anyway.There will be no ‘norms’ and people will choose to live and love inmany ways that will be considered shocking and outrageous today.They are nothing of the kind. Love is love is love. We will see thereturn of the extended family and less emphasis on the two parents andtwo children model of today.In other books I have likened what is happening to the Earth’s energyfield to a bowl of water. If you wish to raise the level of the water fromthe bottom of the bowl to the top you have to turn on the tap. As youdo this, the calmness in the water is disturbed and the more you turn onthe tap, the more confusion, chaos, and turmoil is unleashed in thebowl. When you reach the top of the bowl and turn off the tap, thecalmness quickly returns, but at a much higher level than before. If yousee the water in this example as the Earth’s energy field and the tap asthe energies coming in, you can see the potential for extreme effects.In Truth Vibrations, written in 1990, I passed on channelled predictionsof the following themes in this decade and the next one:* Growing and often staggering extremes of weather and othernatural disasters, including massive fires.* Gathering conflict all over the world to the point where theUnited Nations would be overwhelmed.* The collapse of the world economic system.* The rise of the political right.* The break up of the Soviet Union and other large countries andempires.* The end of the British monarchy, traditional politics and"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"251institutions of state, and conventional economic and scientificthinking.* The collapse of the religious empires like the Roman CatholicChurch and the rise of the religious right as a last desperate attemptto keep them going.* Record breaking earthquakes, volcanoes, tidal waves, andgeneral geological activity.* Time appearing to pass quicker every year. This is the effect ofthe quickening vibrations and the speeding up of ‘Cosmic time’. Youcan’t see this in the hands of the clock moving quicker, but you canfeel it and there seems to be less time to do everything.These effects will have a dual cause. The brotherhood network willbe trying to cause as much disruption as possible to stop thetransformation, and hold back the Earth’s energy field so it cannotmake its evolutionary leap and leave them behind. I feel they will beusing their knowledge and technology to try to weaken the grid andstop the rise in fequency. They even have the technology to affect theweather, particular in smaller areas. The changes within the Earth’senergy field will also create many of these effects, but there issomething we can do about that. The situation is this, quite simply.The further the energy field is from balance the more disruption willbe caused by the re-balancing effects of the Photon Beam. So themore we, humanity, can help to create that balance the less traumaticthis period will be in all things. The further you push down a pair ofscales on one side, the more dramatic is the ‘kick back’ when theythrash around seeking balance. The principle is the same with theEarth’s energy field. The more we can generate the energy called lovefrom our heart chakra for the Earth, people, and all forms of life, themore we will help the planet to balance out the negative. This willmake less extreme the process of passing through the balancingbeam. We all have the potential to do that, it only takes the will and achange of perception. You can make that change now if you wish.Love yourself; love your enemies, love the world.We are not alone. Other extra-terrestrial consciousness streams areworking to help. But they will not impose themselves on our right tofree will as the others do. We have to ask for their help. More thananything we need to help ourselves.We certainly need the support and love we can get because theLuciferic consciousness knows what is happening and the nature ofthe consciousness shift that is underway.

We notonly have to think love, and think change, we have to live it, too.For instance, if we don’t challenge practically the ambitions of theBrotherhood, we are allowing the spiritual revolution, the RobotsRebellion, to be blocked. It is harder to rebel and think for yourselfwhen you have a micro-chip inside you transmitting theBrotherhood’s message than when you are free from suchinterference. And those under such manipulation are hardly going togenerate the love and understanding we urgently need. In the rest ofthe book I am going to outline some of the ways we can speed thespiritual revolution, and stop the brotherhood from stopping us. Iwill start with the economic system which the elite currentlycontrols.Even with six billion people sharing this planet, it is still possibleto provide for everyone’s need. What it is not possible to do, asGandhi said, is to provide for everyone’s greed. The economicsystem which meets the wants of the few by denying the needs ofthe majority is in its twilight years. It is unsustainableenvironmentally, and even in its own primitive economic terms ithas reached the end of the road. Don’t be kidded by those computerscreens in the financial centres and the economists with their jargonand System-speak. They are programmed minds who mostly parrotthe System’s line because they can’t raise their vision to see beyondit. This makes them easy fodder for the Illuminati elite to pursuadeor bribe them to support ever greater centralisation. The presentsystem isn’t working and so on the basis of ‘something must bedone’ they promote more central control, like a World Central Bank.That changes nothing. It’s the same lunacy controlled by fewerpeople."},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"254The first thing we need to do is remove economic growth from ourassessment of human and economic success. Gross Domestic Productis the figure that mesmerises and controls the policies ofgovernments throughout the world. But GDP is meaningless. All itmeasures is the amount of money that changes hands for goods andservices in any year. THAT IS IT. Economic growth is not ameasurement of economic success, it is merely a measurement ofeconomic activity. It is like measuring the success of a soccer teamby the amount of running it does in a match rather than the number ofgoals it scores. Every time there is an environmental disaster causedby the pursuit of economic growth, the money spent on reacting tothat disaster is added to economic growth because it is adding toeconomic activity; every time someone is ill and needs treatment itadds to GDP; the same when there is a war. The system of self-destruction takes the money made from growth and the money madefrom the consequences of growth, and instead of taking one from theother, it adds the two together. Staggering? Of course it is, but that isthe system that controls your life and is dismantling the planet.Any system which uses the growth figure as its only measurementof national, human, and economic success must create a barely-one-dimensional world which reflects the nature of its economics. Butthen that is what the Brotherhood bankers want it to be. Any sanesociety, which ours is about to become, must have measurements ofhuman progress that reflect the multidimensional beings that we are,such as:How few are in poverty?How few are homeless?How few are hungry?How few are lonely?How few are unhappy, dissatisfied, and unfulfilled?How few feel they are denied the opportunity to realise their fullpotential?How few feel their lives are controlled by others?These are some of the true indicators of human progress, and yetthey are the very areas ignored by the present system, because thosewho control it wish to imprison the people, not set them free. Fortheir system to survive it has to increase, not decrease, everything onthat list. What is good for people is a disaster for the System. Youwill notice, too, that the measurements I have listed refer to ‘how"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"255few?’. Today’s system measures success only in ‘how many?’Increasing ‘throughput’ is all it can think 0£ The more units ofactivity it can produce, the more successful it claims to be. Questiongovernment ministers about health care provision and they will replyin justification of their policies: ‘We are treating more people thanever before’. But why? Why do so many need treatment? Surelysuccess in health care should be measured by how few requiretreatment and how many people are healthy, not by how many are ill.The System sees rising house prices as a sign of economic successwhile thousands live in the street because they can’t afford a home.Surely success should be judged on how few people are homeless,and not by how much more it costs every year to buy a house.The whole throughput mentality is so ridiculous that you havetransport ministers welcoming increased car sales (throughout), whileat the same time complaining that they can’t afford to build all thenew roads necessary to cope with the extra traffic. (A consequence ofthroughput.)The acceleration of human and industrial throughput will not solvethe problems of the world. It is creating most of them. America hasconsumed more fossil fuels and minerals in the last 50 years than therest of humanity combined in the whole of human history. If growthis the way to eliminate poverty, homelessness, hunger, and all theother human ills why hasn’t America managed to do it, despiteconsuming the planet on that suicidal scale? And what would happento the Earth if every country sought to do the same? But that isexactly what they are being urged to do. Brotherhood-manipulatedpoliticians and economists have even invented the impossible in theirdesperation to justify this and hide the realities. They now talk of‘sustainable growth’ when there is no such thing. No growth issustainable, because we live on a planet of finite size with a finiteability to take the punishment. Yet the journalists and interviewersnever question them on this obvious contradiction.Greens are ridiculed for their policy of a no-growth economy. Butwhat could be more sensible and efficient? That policy says thereshould be no growth and a significant annual decline in the rate weuse natural ‘resources’. This reduces destructive throughput bygetting more from less; by making things to last as long astechnological knowledge will allow; by recycling waste back into theproduction process so reducing the need to take more from theplanet; by insulating buildings to reduce the fuel required to keep"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"256them warm; and by encouraging local production for localconsumption to reduce the need for so much transportation and thetrucks, motorways, etc. The list of ways we can get more from lessthrough commonsense is endless. This would lead to a sustainable,steady state, economy in which no more is taken from the Earth thanshe can replenish and no more is thrown back at the Earth than shecan safely absorb. In the future we will not need to take from theEarth at all for our fuels because there is no need to once youunderstand the nature of energy and how to harness it for warmth andpower.The theory which seeks to justify growth as the way to removesuffering is called ‘trickle down.’ The belief is that if you allow therich to exploit and become richer that will create the money at the topwhich will ‘trickle down’ in wages and services to provide incomefor those further down the economic scale. The same justification isapplied to countries. If the rich get richer they will trade with thepoor, and money will trickle down to them. The problem is that itdoesn’t work and the brotherhood bankers know it doesn’t work. It isnot supposed to. Most of the money stays near the top of thepyramid, because the closer you are to the top the more you get paid.Those at the bottom have to survive on the scraps that fall from therich man’s table which, in a phrase, is what trickle down really is. Atthe bottom of the pyramid the majority of the people in the worldstruggle for, and often fail to find, even the basics of humanexistence. The world has had well over a century of rapid economicgrowth, and yet half the population of the planet is in relative orabsolute poverty. Around a billion are in absolute poverty, thedefinition of which is ‘a condition of life so characterised bymalnutrition, illiteracy, and disease as to be beneath any reasonabledefinition of human decency’. But the growth-trickle-down fallacyhas hypnotised all the political movements, the Greens apart. Ask acapitalist, communist, socialist, or liberal democrat for a way forwardeconomically, and they will give you a version of take, make andthrowaway based on trickle down.As the frequencies rise and consciousness expands, this illusion isbeing rejected by millions of people, and the numbers will grow at anever-quickening rate. Even those who once dismissed or ignored theGreen analysis are beginning to question openly the economicmadness we are indoctrinated to worship. The billionaire financier,James Goldsmith, said this in the London Times:"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"257“Economic growth is the way to measure success, and science andtechnology are its principal tools. This is the basis of modernthought, but I question it. The leading modern society, America, hasproduced the greatest surge in economic growth and materialprosperity in history. In the past fifty years its gross domestic product(GDP) has grown in constant, inflation-adjusted dollars, from $1.5trillion to $5.9 trillion. American science and technology haveachieved incredible innovations. And yet, American society is deeplyill.”There will still be the brotherhood fodder who try to retain andjustify all that I have described, because they believe it is best forthem personally, or they are closing their minds to the changingconsciousness. But trying to prop up this economic insanity will belike trying to plug holes in a crumbling dyke. For every leak youmanage to repair temporarily, another dozen will be sprung, until theentire dyke is washed away. The economic system has to go, and wehave to stop cooperating with it. What we must be aware of is anengineered collapse of the global economy by the brotherhood withthe intention of introducing a WorJd Central Bank pledged to rebuildit. This is their intention and while no-one wants the System to bedismantled more than me, we must resist centralisation and use thecollapse to de-link from the System. We can expect a crash on theglobal stock markets which the Brotherhood would have no troubleinstigating and that will send the System into free fall. Insurancecompanies faced with more claims through crime and naturaldisasters, and fewer people who can afford the rising premiums arealready feeling the walls of change closing in. Add to this thefinancial implications of changing attitudes to life, the weatherextremes, and geological events, and you can see the days arenumbered for the economics of the madhouse. The only danger, as Ikeep stressing, is if we allow the collapse to justify furthercentralisation. If that happens the System will be rebuilt with evenmore control.So what can we do?I can’t say exactly what will happen, because no-one knows indetail what the future will bring or how humanity will use its freewill to react. But if we are to end the power of an economic elite weneed to move from the big to the small; from central control tocommunity and individual control; from humans serving technology"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"258to technology serving humans. Awakening people are demandingthese changes and they will be necessary anyway when the worldeconomic order is holed below the water line and sinks. There isgoing to be a great deal of reacting to events and we will have tomove very quickly. We will see that we all depend on each other, andcommunity spirit is going to return in a very big way.Throughout the Industrial era, the trends have been in the otherdirection. Financial power has been concentrated in fewer and fewerhands by the cost of installing mass producing technology and theneed to compete with other countries. This has been the bankers’doing. We have seen community businesses fail in the face of unfair,market-rigged, competition from the major banks and corporations,all of which are Brotherhood controlled. National companies havegrown through this economic injustice to become multi-nationalswhich wield enormous power around the world. Many of them have abigger turnover every year than scores of countries, and that givesthem the muscle to exploit those countries and even govern themfrom behind the scenes. This brings about the grotesque sight of foodgrowing land in poor countries being used to grow luxury crops forthe rich. This is often at the instigation of Brotherhood multi-nationalcorporations and corrupt politicians.In my book It Doesn’t Have To Be Like This, there is a chapterentitled ‘Empty Bellies and Chocolate Bars’. It is so called becauseaccording to Oxfam well over half the children in Ghana aremalnourished, while half the food growing land in Ghana is growingcocoa for the western chocolate industry. Another statistic I used inthat book was that 400,000 children are reckoned to die in Brazilevery year from hunger-related disease when Brazil is one of thebiggest exporters of food in the world. While those children live anddie in poverty, the land that could feed them is used to increase theprofits of multi-nationals and the rich world in general. Thismanipulation of trade and debt by the West has led to the almostunbelievable situation in which more money passes from poorcountries to rich every year than goes the other way. Remember thatnext time you see Western politicians talking about the ‘aid’ they aresending to the poor, or when you hear people criticise such aidbecause ‘charity begins at home.’ No it doesn’t. Exploitation beginsat home and is exported across the world. In the new tomorrow theword charity will be used only in accounts of human history. Therewill be giving and receiving, but there will be no dependence and"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"259therefore no ‘charity’. Charity exists today only because exploitationand manipulated dependency has created the need for it.The System controls us through dependencE. It makes usdependent upon it for all the necessities of life, food, clothing,warmth, and shelter. That has been its Lucifer-inspired ambition, andit has largely succeeded. This dependence on essentials means thatwe have to play the System’s game or we won’t survive. The firstpriority of any new economics must be to reduce and then removedependence on the System for those things. Once you have adequatefood, clothing, warmth, and shelter, you immediately have choices.You no longer have to do what the System wants you to do.Removing dependence requires the dismantling of centralised powerin all areas of our lives. Economically and politically it means small,not big, is beautiful.The emphasis will be on communities coming together to supplytheir own needs, and not being dependent on a system over whichthey have no control. It has become so silly that if someone starts arumour on the Tokyo stockmarket to make a financial killing, theknock-on effect can have consequences for the lives of people livingon the other side of the planet. Self-reliance and self-sufficiency inall essentials will be the basic model of future economics, becausethat decreases dependence and gives power back to people. In thisview of economics, the people of Ghana will be fed by food grownon their own land. The needs of their people will be served first, andnot those of the multi-national chocolate factories. Poorer countrieshave been persuaded and manipulated to believe that the best way forthem to ‘succeed’ is to use their land to grow cash crops for theWestern multi-nationals and to use that money to import food fromthe West. This means the West can’t lose. It can make the chocolateproducts to sell back to places like Ghana at a profit, and also sellsfood to them. Even better, it controls the price of both the cash cropsit imports from those countries and the products and food it exportsto them, because the West controls the financial system. Or theBrotherhood does. The countries of the Third World know that if theyrefuse to accept this injustice, the multi-nationals will moveelsewhere as they play off one poor country against another. The wayout of this bind of control through dependence is to produce theessentials locally whenever possible and local production for localneed will be forced upon us anyway by weather, geological, politicaland economic upheavals. The only effective response to all this will"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"260come locally. Look at the chaos that one snow storm, hurricane, orperiod of heavy rain can cause. Imagine what will happen as all thatincreases. We are going to see just how tenuous is our modern,technological, world when faced with the realities and power ofnature.The GATT agreement which is designed to open up the world toever greater competition by removing import barriers is theIlluminati elite at work again. If you want to create dependency onthe System for all the countries of the world, the myth of free tradehas had to be sold and conditioned into people because without‘free’ trade the strong could no longer exploit the weak on anythinglike the same scale. The truth is that trade has never been free inmodern society. It is a licence to exploit the weak. The GATTagreement is an effort by the elite to create more control anddependence. Those politicians and economists who can’t see the realagenda promoted GATT in a desperate attempt to find more placesto sell products and generate ‘growth’. But of course there are stillonly so many people and so much money, and for everyone whosells more as a result of this agreement someone else must sell less.The ones that sell more will be those who sell cheapest, and theywill be the ones prepared to exploit people and the planet more thanthe opposition. For every winner there must be even more losers.We have turned trade and economics into a sporting contest, a sortof Economic Olympics. We talk of ‘Japan pulling ahead’ or ‘Koreacoming through fast’ while most of the world never even gets to thestadium.Events will unfold, I believe, that will reduce the production of oil,the cocaine of the System. It is addicted to oil and only survives byconsuming and pricing it at levels which do not reflect the reality thatit is finite and has fantastic environmental costs. Take away oil andthere is basically no System. If this happens it will bring an end to theridiculous situation in which one country exports a product to theother side of the world while importing back across the world thatcountry’s version of the same product. It is justified in the name of‘choice’, but what is this choice? The choice of having ten, twenty, ahundred different shampoos to buy, all of which do the same basicjob with the same basic ingredients? What about the choice denied topeople of going out in the sunshine at certain times of the yearbecause a system that speaks of ‘choice’ has so damaged the ozonelayer that skin cancer is becoming an epidemic in some areas? Do"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"261you know that products are often transported from country tocountry with each one adding another component because that’s thecheapest way for multi-nationals to produce them? Our ports andairports are full of ships and planes using fuel and resources andcausing untold pollution when most of it is unnecessary. It servesno-one except multinational corporations and the bankers. Far fromsupplying needs and ‘choice’ it is actually denying both to themajority.In the years ahead, countries and communities are going to bemore concerned with supplying their own necessities than exportingtheir production across the planet. This will unlock so muchcreativity. If the economic system is the way people are controlledand pressured to conform, think what opportunities await us as itcollapses or we de-link ourselves from it and those pressures areremoved. The Chinese word for crisis, wei-chi, means both dangerand opportunity. While the fall of the System may be seen as adanger to us, it is really an opportunity to unleash all the infinitepower of human ingenuity. This has been imprisoned by a system inwhich thinking is the last thing it wants us to do. Orders are issuedfrom above by the few and the majority do as they are told. They arenot asked their opinion, they are treated like robots. If you want tofind the best way of doing something you don’t ask a manager in anoffice, you ask those who do the job day after day. But those peopleare rarely consulted. In the future there will be no ‘us’ and ‘them’,no orders from above. Those who currently impose their view onothers are going to be in the same boat as everyone else as theRobots’ Rebellion gathers pace. The economic disintegration causedby a variety of reasons will give us a blank sheet of paper on whichto start again.The quickening frequencies are triggering within us the desire forcontrol over our own lives. This is leading us towards smallereconomic units and a wish to withdraw ourselves from the presentsystem as much as we can. The necessities of providing for need inthe wake of the collapse will demand the same course of action. Inthe transition period at least, the emphasis will be on barter goodsand services in exchange for goods and services with often little orno money changing hands. This expansion of barter is happeningtoday. People who are awakening are using it to step out of theSystem as much as they can and as unemployment rises millions areseeing that the System can no longer provide for them and their"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"262families and has no prospect of doing so. This approach is going tobe vital, as social security payments are squeezed and used to turnpeople into little more than slaves to the State.When I wrote It Doesn’t Have To Be Like This, which waspublished in 1990, I highlighted a barter system called LETS. At thetime I could find only three examples of this at work in England,Today, only a few years later, there are countless LETS Systems inaction. LETS is short for Local Employment and Trade System and itovercomes the limitations of money. Under the present economicorder, money is everything. In a recession when money is tight, skillsare locked within people. The money is not there to pay them fortheir skills and allow them to pay others for theirs. Many of the needsof people and their communities go unmet when the skills are there toprovide them. LETS releases those skills. It works like this:You invent a currency. The name doesn’t matter because it doesn’tactually exist in physical form. They are just imaginary units ofexchange. When you join a LETS group, you are given a list of allthe skills and contributions being offered by the other members. Youwrite down a list of all the things that you can do. It can be anythingfrom baby sitting to repairing a house. If there is something you needthat a member of the group can provide, you contact them and agreea price in your unit of currency. On the Isle of Wight where I live,one group has called their currency ‘Wights’ and that is the name Iwill use here, but it could be anything. Let us say that you contact acar mechanic in the group and you agree a price of 50 Wights for himor her to repair your car. When the job is done, you ring the LETScoordinator and you say ‘credit so and so with 50 Wights and debitmy account with the same.’ The mechanic now has fifty units whichhe or she can use to purchase your skills or anyone else’s in the groupand you have committed yourself to giving 50 units worth of work tothe group also.No money has changed hands, but you have your car repaired andthe mechanic will be paid in whatever services he or she might need.It may be that, for the moment, some money has to be spent on itemspurchased within the System, perhaps some spark plugs or engineparts in this case, but in some LETS groups even shops are offeringfood and goods in exchange or part exchange for barter in this way.You can take it further and have each member commit themselves toso many units of work a month for those in the community whocannot contribute through illness or infirmity. But there are very few"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"263who cannot offer something. One way of running LETS is to have arate per hour for everyone so all time is measured equally.You can start now, the sooner the better, to build a communityeconomy as independent as possible from the world system. Themore we can live outside of that system, the more the power of theBrotherhood Bankers is reduced. Put an advertisement in the paperand call a public meeting or just gather a few friends around who youthink might be interested. There might already be a LETS in yourarea which you can join. There are no rules that must be obeyed.Each group works out what is best for them and learns withexperience how best to proceed. These LETS groups can grow quitelarge, but it is best to keep them to manageable numbers. It isimportant to have them up and running as soon as possible to reducedependency on the Brotherhood and to limit the chaos and sufferingwhen the present system collapses.In the new peoples’ economics we will need local cooperatives andcommunity-owned companies for food distribution. It is simply daftfor food to be grown in one area and sent long distances to othercommunities while those communities send their produce in the otherdirection. Food cooperatives will have the role ofcollectmg the foodfrom local farmers and growers and distributing this to the localshops and markets. To be truly responsive to local needs, thesecooperatives should be controlled by representatives of ALL thecommunity, not only the farmers and growers. We will requirecommunity organisations, again with all views and needsrepresented, to coordinate the production and distribution of thenecessities of life to everyone in their community. Their brief will beto ensure that no-one goes without food, warmth, clothing, andshelter. This can be provided much more quickly and efficiently bylocal communities once they can control their own lives and be freedfrom the barriers presented by the current system to any form ofactivity which operates independently of its structure. Thesecommunity economic cooperatives will also have the role ofidentifying the goods and produce imported into a community whichcould be produced locally. They will then seek ways to replace theimports with local production. There can be local currencies to workalongside barter and community banks will be developed to channellocal money into the local economy. These banks should not makemoney out of money, only cover their costs. If we are going to bringin the changes to ensure that economics serves people, the System of"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"264making money out of money must end. To type in numbers on acomputer screen and then charge interest for lending money thatdoesn’t exist has to stop if the control is going to stop. Money shouldbe a form of exchange and a measurement of productive activitiesand not a way of increasing your wealth for doing nothing. This ethoshas turned the global economy into a giant casino with the tablerigged against all, but the few.I am not suggesting that communities cut themselves off from eachother in the local economies. Quite the opposite. There will still betrade where possible, but it will be for the mutual and equal benefitof both communities involved and largely based on an exchangesystem of barter rather than a financial transaction. I do not see tradein necessities except where one community cannot provide them foritself. As you will see in the next chapter I am saying that we needcloser links between communities not an intensification of division.But why does unnecessary and destructive economic activity whichmakes all communities dependent on outside forces have to be abasis for cooperating with each other? Surely the fierce competitionbetween communities such a system creates discourages the verycooperation we wish to see.It is time for people of all backgrounds, creeds, colours, and viewsto come together and cooperate for the good of the whole and notcompete for the good of the few. I can recommend a book calledAfter The Crash by Guy Dauncey (Green Print) which offers lots ofadvice and examples of how to build a local economy in whichpeople can free themselves from the clutches of national andinternational control. Don’t let anyone tell you this isn’t possible. Itis, and it is happening now. Local production for local need is thedirection in which we are being guided by changing consciousnessand economic necessity. We will also realise from these experiencesthat we have been indoctrinated to accept a perverted view ofefficiency. We have been sold the line that says if you centralise yourproduction you can produce things cheaper. This might be true in afew cases, but not the majority. Most of these products are onlycheaper in the shops because they do not reflect the full cost ofproducing and distributing them. Let me give you an idea of what Imean.If something is made or grown locally and sold as near as possibleto where it is produced, the price will reflect virtually the full cost ofproduction and distribution. Not all of it, but most of it. That is not"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"265the case with centralised production. When you centralise you needmassive trucks to deliver those products. You need millions of themand they must get bigger and more destructive as the centralisationintensifies. They consume fossil fuels at a breathtaking rate with thetrucks capable of less than ten miles to the gallon. To cope with thesetrucks we have to build more motorways and by-passes at incrediblecost. We have to spend money repairing the motorways and roads, thewater and gas pipes, buildings, and pavements, all damaged by theever increasing weight of the trucks. We have to pay in medical costsfor the growth in road accidents and ill health caused by pollution andthe stress of living alongside roads full of traffic and trucks whichshake your home and deny you peace and quiet. We have to spendmore on the welfare system, because people-based businesses whichserved their local communities have been closed down by machine-based giants who largely serve only their shareholders and profitmargins. Financial speculation, not human need, dominates industry -just as the Illuminati Protocols said it would.None of these costs I have listed are reflected in the price of theproducts that are produced in this way. You pay for them once at theshop and again in your taxes, while the costs in environmentaldestruction are not even acknowledged. They are passed on to futuregenerations which, through reincarnation, could be us! All thiscreates an illusion of efficiency which has hoodwinked billions ofpeople into accepting centralisation as ‘progress’. When those costshave to be reflected in the price on the shelf local production willoften be shown to be cheaper, especially the essentials like food.Packaged and factory-prepared food is far more expensive thanbuying fresh food locally and preparing it yourself. The national andmulti-national food conglomerates have to find ways of taking apotato or a carrot and adding as much to its value as they can. Theydo this by turning out processed, conveyor belt, ‘convenience’ foodin the form of crisps or pies or whatever. And because food producedin this way has to travel long distances before being eaten, chemicalsand preservatives have to be added which increase the cost of themedical services by the affect they have on the human body. This ison top of the poisons the food already contains as a consequence ofchemical-based farming methods. The food giants can ensure bigprofits from what started out as a potato or vegetable costing only afew pennies. We will see the return of buying fresh food locally andpreparing it at home at a much cheaper cost in the years ahead."},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"266The centralisation of production and political control have broughtabout the death of community. The System’s policy of divide and rulehas destroyed so much community spirit, cooperation and local self-reliance. Local post offices and small shops have closed. So havelocal schools and children have to be bussed out of their communityto the big, often impersonal, centralised schools. Their parents havealso had to travel longer distances to work as centralisation hasclosed local firms and created the need for mass commuting with allthe road, public transport, and pollution costs that entails. People areforced to begin and end each working day in traffic jams or crowdedtrains alongside others in the same situation. More of their time istaken by working and travelling, and less is available for families,friends, and life in the community. Governments talk of the need for‘family values’ while promoting a system that breaks up families formost of every day, and creates pressures that many relationships donot survive. More people are now realising that if you can reduceyour number of ‘wants’, you need less money to live. Simplifyingyour life like this can free those most precious of gifts - time andchoice.Yet another consequence of centralisation has been the dependenceof communities on one or very few companies for their economicstability. When those industries falter or the companies decide it isbetter for them to centralise elsewhere, the communities aredevastated because their economic base is so small and dependent onso few. Community economies of the kind that will evolve in theyears ahead will not suffer from such lack of diversity.The multi-nationals who use their power to exploit people and theplanet will not survive the transformation. The expansion ofconsciousness will ensure that their days will pass. Business will gothrough a fundamental reassessment of values and motivations,because the evolution of consciousness is not limited to the weak andthe poor. It is touching everyone who is prepared to open their mindand go with the gathering flow. I wish to emphasise again that in mycritique of the economic system I am not condemning or judgingpeople. I am challenging the thought patterns that control the peoplewho serve the System.

Is that all that life is about?Are we here to be terrified of not selling more things every year? Iknow that many business executives are already asking thesequestions and they are realising that they are victims also. The newbusiness that will emerge from the ashes of the old will be there toserve rather than exploit and it will judge its success by thesecriteria:(1) Is the process of producing, distributing, and selling the productdamaging in any way to the planet and the natural life supportsystems?(2) Is the business exploiting the world rather than making acontribution to healing the world, serving human need, and making ita better place for all people and life-forms?(3) Is the business harming or exploiting animals mentally,emotionally or physically and causing them pain and stress of anykind?(4) Is the business exploiting people to maximise profits?

An executive from a multi-national fashioncorporation told me that he was already seeing this rejection ofuniform ity showing itself in their sales figures. They could no longersell one design all over the world. People were looking for individualdesigns that allowed them to express their individuality.

The re-connection of lower and higher self willlead to a rebalancing of economics and business practice. Those whotry to continue with the old methods and motivations will findthemselves struggling to sell their products. The System has beencreated to appeal to the five physical senses. Products and advertisinghave been geared to this and the five senses have largely made thedecision on what and where to buy. Now other senses are cominginto play. These are the higher senses that work through the intuition.They are often referred to in every day conversation as a ‘sixthsense’, although there are many levels of them. These are becomingmore influential in decision-making as people awaken. Everything isenergy and absorbs energy. The energy in a production process istransferred to the product and that energy, consciousness, will reflectthe intent behind the product. If the intent is only to make as muchmoney as possible, the product will carry that thought pattern. If theproduction involves environmental degradation, that, too, will be inthe energy field of the product.This has not really mattered to companies so far because the five"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"269senses do not relate directly to that energy field of the product. Theyrelate to its feel, smell, taste, look or sound. But as growing millionsbecome more sensitive to higher levels of themselves, they will betuning into the energy fields of everything and everyone -.includingproducts in the shops. They will sense on these intuitive levels theintent behind a product. They won’t be saying:‘Oh I’ll buy this pair of jeans because I can sense that the intent ofthe company is to serve, not exploit’. They will simply pick oneproduct and not another because their intuition will encourage themto do so. They won’t know why they are choosing that product. Theywill just do it. This will mean big trouble for those companies whichproduce with negative intent and they will be racking their brainstrying to work out why people are rejecting their goods when thereappears to be no explainable reason why this should suddenly be so.There will be two stages in the transformation of economics andbusiness. The first stage will be the acceleration in the break down ofthe old and the attempts by the brotherhood to use that situation tobring in their World Central Bank and one currency. From the chaosthat will follow this period, the new will emerge. There will be agreat deal of ad-libbing and reacting to events. It will be a time whenbarter will be essential and we will have to help each other on thebasis of need. New technologies will be discovered which I will talkabout later which will transform our lives. This technology will giveus all the power and warmth we need without touching or harmingthe physical Earth - and it is technology that already exists. Thesecond stage will see the consolidation of the new economics andtechnologies as the old fades to become history. As the decades of thenext century come and go and the frequencies go on rising, humanitywill build a new world of amazing and wondrous potential. What wewould call miracles will be as much a part of every day life as take,make, and throwaway is today.I cannot stress enough the importance of distinguishing betweenthe transition period and the world that will follow. Yes, of course,there will be traumatic times. This always happens when one era isreplaced rapidly by another. I can see shortages of food perhaps andmuch upheaval. But the transformation to a higher consciousness isnot leading us back to caves, hardship and struggle. If you want asystem that brings hardship and struggle, then stick with the presentone. That delivers both with unwavering efficiency. Thetransformation is guiding us to an era of abundance in the next"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"270century. When the destructive ways have been replaced and theBrotherhood’s control dismantled, the Earth will be abundant in hergifts of food and beauty. Love will replace hate and cooperation willreplace competition. The present system does not want abundance.Its power is in scarcity. That increases the price, the profit, and theability to control.We will see that life is meant to be a joy. We are not here to bevictims and it wasn’t supposed to be like this. Deep down beneath thelayers of conditioning, the robots know this is true and the memoriesof that truth are beginning to stir within the hearts of those who havethe will and the vision to think for themselves. Knowledge andunderstanding is starting to surface and the robots are rebelling. Noteveryone will make that choice, perhaps the majority will not. Butmany will and they will change the world. Change and necessity shallfree all our pent-up, locked-up, creativity, love, and passion forliving. We will see human nature in its fullest and most gloriousexpression. We will discover potential within us that we neverbelieved possible. Humans are not sinners who must find Jesus to be‘saved’. We have been misguided and misdirected by a disconnectionfrom our true selves, that’s all. The re-connection into Wholenesswill bring a transformation of outlook and values that will rid thisplanet of the ills that currently overwhelm human consciousness. Itwill also wrest control from the forces that seek to destroy.All is thought and thought is all. Nothing happens in the physicalworld which has not been preceded by a thought. Physical actions aremanifestations of thought. If thought is imbalanced and destructiveso will be the physical world. If thought is balanced, loving, andconstructive, that is the society that will emerge. We create our ownreality, and that is why vision is so important. The greater the visionthe greater the reality.

It is simply not true.How can 365 members of Parliament in Britain have power over apopulation of some 57 million? Or a President have power over 250million Americans? They can’t. Their only power is in persuading usthat they have power. Like everything on this physical level, it is anillusion.I mentioned earlier that towards the end of British rule in India,Gandhi told the colonial government, ‘100,000 Englishmen cannotcontrol 300 million Indians if those Indians will not cooperate’. Inthat one sentence you can see where the real power lies. It lies withus, the mass of the people, and not with governments, armies,industrial conglomerates, or the Brotherhood. They only appear tohave power because of the apathy and indoctrination of the robots.Once enough robots wake up and rebel we will see what a sleight ofhand this business of ‘power’ really is. I feel for politicians. In manyways, they are the biggest victims, the most programmed of roboticbeings. They change nothing which is not acceptable to the system.The economic madness which they have helped to unleash across theworld has imprisoned them and their successors. They are no morefree to act on fundamental issues than a prisoner in Dartmoor or SanQuentin. At election time, they have to tell people what they believeenough of them want to hear. If they don’t do that, they don’t getelected. And what do most people want to hear from their politicians?What the system has indoctrinated them to demand. More growth,possessions, money and economic ‘success’ for their country.Politicians are pawns being moved around a board by theBrotherhood, a programmed population and the interdependency thesystem has constructed. Politicians cannot act independently in onecountry because they are linked to a system which insists that they"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"272play by its rules. If they seek to limit imports of unnecessary goodswhich their country is capable of making for itself; othersimmediately take action to block their country’s exports. Even thosepoliticians who have seen the system for what it is - and there arepainfully few - would recoil at the prospect of taking any action thatwould bring with it a chaotic but vital period of transition while theireconomy was recovering from the colossal blow of losing exportrevenue and redirecting itself into producing the goods it had beenimporting until then.Any government which tried to do this would be overthrown eitherdemocratically or by force. The System has the politicians slavishlyserving its wishes through manipulation, indoctrination and fear.They will never take the action necessary to free humanity from itsimprisonment or the planet from her punishment. Only by thesystem’s collapse and its replacement by another way of thinking canwe be freed from our dependency and be able to step into an era ofeconomic sanity.Essential to this is an end to politics as we know it. Representativesof the people are there to serve those people, not their party or self-interest. It is such an insult to the word democracy to see politiciansallowing themselves to be used like fodder to vote in Congress, theHouse of Commons and the other parliaments of the world inwhatever way their party leaders tell them. They are the prisoners ofthe Whip system. The Whips are party officials who are there toensure that the Members of Parliament which the population haselected follow the wishes of their party and never the urgings of theirconscience or what they believe are the needs of the people.Parliaments are, appropriately, microcosms of the whole system. Youhave the few at the top like the Prime Minister and the Cabinet, or thePresident and his advisors, who try to force their Members ofParliament or Congress to toe their line. They, in turn, most of themwithout realising it, serve the non-elected Brotherhood above them.Political leaders often talk of the need for people to show selfresponsibility, but they are the last ones who want to see any suchthing - especially in their own party. When MPs take responsibilityfor their own thoughts and vote with their beliefs, they are‘disciplined’ by their party and told they will never be considered forpromotion. This is democracy?I remember when I was a national speaker for the British GreenParty, the Conservative Government introduced a Poll Tax which was"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"273deeply unfair in that it asked the poor to pay the same as the rich. Thestrength of the protests and a campaign of non-payment forced theGovernment to scrap it (people power again). At the time, theEnvironment Secretary vehemently supported the tax and condemnedthose who challenged its unfairness. It was he who guided the billthrough parliament to bring the Poll Tax into law. Some years later,that same man was interviewed on a programme looking back at theyears of Margaret Thatcher as Prime Minister. He said he had alwaysbelieved the Poll Tax was unworkable and should never have beenintroduced. He had, he claimed, even said this to Margaret Thatcherbefore he had agreed to introduce it. On the same programme, theChancellor of the Exchequer at the time of the Poll Tax said that he,too, had told Mrs Thatcher it was a ridiculous idea. The film cut fromhim to archive footage of Margaret Thatcher proclaiming the Poll Taxat a Conservative Party Conference. Sitting close by and clapping allthat she said was that same Chancellor of the Exchequer who, inprivate, was saying it should never be introduced.Stories like that and much, much, worse could be repeated manytimes in parliaments all over the world. Let us not avoid the issuehere. The political system and the economic system are one and thesame. They are indivisible. Both are sick, corrupt, stupid,selfdestructing and Brotherhood-controlled. Like the economic order,the political circus has created mechanisms and structures for turningout the robots and clones it needs to survive. Unless you are asystem-serving, toe-the-liner, you will struggle to be selected torepresent a major party in an election. Some people with a mind oftheir own slip through this net, but they are so few they can bemuzzled or made impotent even if they are elected. The attitudes tolife you need to become an MP or a Senator are mostly the oppositeof what is required for honest, fair and inspired government.“The political has nothing in common with the moral. The rulerwho is governed by the moral is not a skilled politician and istherefore unstable on his throne. He who wishes to rule must haverecourse to both cunning and to make believe. Great nationalqualities like frankness and honesty are vices in politics, for theybring down rulers from their thrones more effectively and morecertainly than the most powerful enemy.” (Illuminati Protocol 1).Like the economic system, politics has become ever more"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"274centralised through this century. British local government has hadresponsibilities and decision-making on many issues removed byWestminster; and Westminster is surrendering responsibilities to theEuropean Community. Others have done the same. It is all leadingtowards the Brotherhood dream of a World Government and I evenhear some intelligent, caring people supporting the idea, often fromthe best of intentions. I say again and again... NO,NO NO. As withmost changes that give power to the few, it can be presented as highlydesirable. If we had a World Government, they say, we could stopthis or stop that, do this, or do that. Others believe that the movetowards World Government is a natural part of our evolution andjourney towards wholeness. We started in tribes and communities,this way of thinking suggests, and we are evolving through nationaland continental government to World Government. I challenge thisview. World cooperation and World Government are not the samething. Does anyone really think that a World Government convenedunder the present system is going to be any less sick, corrupt, stupidand self-destructive than national or international governments? Ofcourse not. But we are not looking here at a government that has thepotential to inflict all these things on a single country. We are talkingabout the world.Both sides of the left-right political spectrum have those whosupport the idea, but then, as with most things, the idea of left andright is another illusion. They are different aspects of the samebubble of unreality - and manipulation. The Brotherhood does nothave a political line. It will use anyone or anything for its own ends.In its ranks and under its influence are politicians of all kinds andpersuasions. The Communists and the capitalists speak the samelanguage. Communism is merely a more authoritarian form ofcapitalism, anyway. Politicians, even the high-ranking ones, are merefront men and women compared with those working behind thescenes. President Reagan was an excellent example of this. He firedthe bullets, but others loaded the gun. Imagine what control could begifted to a tiny group of people if World Government became areality. It would have nothing to do with the evolution to wholenessand everything to do with controlling the lives of six billion people.The way to avoid this is to pass decision-making and control downthe line to people and communities and not to create the final rung onthe ladder to world domination. We should demand this and refuse tocooperate with the present system."},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"275Look at examples of how global political-economic organisations,already in existence, have behaved. Those Brotherhood creations, theInternational Monetary Fund and the World Bank, are there to makesure the system is served under all circumstances. When Third Worldcountries begin to struggle to pay back debts to the rich, in goes theIMF to lend them yet more money that doesn’t exist and which theywill not be able to repay. In return for this ‘help’, the IMF insists onmeasures to cut back on spending on the poor, healthcare, educationand food subsidies.This brings more pain and suffering for the population. They alsoinsist that those countries increase their exports to raise money. Morefood-growing land goes under cash crop production. But, with theIMF telling scores of countries to do this, the market is flooded withcertain commodities or goods and the price collapses. They are allexporting more, but earning less. Who wins? The West. It has to payless for its imports. The World Bank (not to be confused with a WorldCentral Bank) is supposed to invest in projects to help the poorercountries. Instead, it has been responsible for investment in ThirdWorld countries that have destroyed their environment, put localfarmers out of business and made western companies richer at theexpense of the very country the bank was supposed to be assisting.If economic control is to be devolved to communities, politicaldecision-making must be similarly devolved. This will be resisted bynational and international governments. They will be desperate tomaintain their control and this is another reason why the economiccrash is necessary. Take economics out of national and internationalgovernments and there is little left for them to do under the presentorder. These governments are, in effect, only stewards of the worldeconomic system on behalf of the banking elite. No-one is going totake any notice of them when the priority for everyone is theprovision of essentials after the crash. They will be politicians withno-one to govern.The breakdown of the old can only lead to a return to localdecision-making, if we reject the Brotherhood plans. There will be noother way to cope and react successfully to what will need to bedone. Eventually we will see the end of political parties. They are theproduct of a divided humanity and have no place in the newtomorrow. Like all ‘isms’ they insist that their members serve the ismfirst and their hearts and conscience second. They battle for power byoffering the same basic policies presented in slightly different"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"276languages but, the Greens apart, they all serve the system and theirmembers serve them. Indeed, some elements of Green politics arealso system-serving without realising it. Political parties have alsoadded to the confrontational nature of politics which mirrors the lackof cooperation that pervades the entire system. Politicians, in general,have sought office to achieve power. They want absolute power toimpose their views upon the population. They will deny this but thatis what they want, collectively. The electoral system in Britain givescontrol of decision-making to parties which considerably less thanhalf the population have voted for. This is all old age nonsense.Politicians should be there to empower people. The key words areenable, allow and respect. To enable people to realise their fullpotential and follow their own instincts; to allow people to dowhatever they wish and live in any way they choose as long as it doesnot cause harm to others; and to respect the rights of all people tocontrol their own lives and make their own choices. Therepresentative is a servant, not a dictator. Modern politics has got thetwo mixed up. From these principles, communities will decide on asystem of representation that suits them. There will be no impositionof rigid structures by national and international governments once thetransformation is well under way. Communities will be in control. Isee elected representation as only part of community action. With thenew consciousness, cooperating will come naturally without the needfor laws and regulations of the kind we have so many of today. Theworld is drowning in laws and legislation because of the desire tocontrol people and in response to the negative behaviour of thosedisconnected from their true selves. Representation will evolve withrising consciousness and in reaction to the collapse of the oldstructures. But, here are a few ideas which are likely to play somepart in the new politics in the post-Brotherhood world:* I think we will see Neighbourhood Councils representing groupsof houses and streets. If someone is lonely or hungry or in any sort ofneed, it will be the role of the Neighbourhood Council to take thenecessary action. They will not ring Social Services because SocialServices won’t exist in the way that it does today. Everything will beon a smaller, community scale. The explosion in the Welfare Stateand Social Services has been a reaction to the collapse of community.Now that the Brotherhood elite have largely achieved that, they willseek to squeeze the welfare services. Neighbourhood Councils will"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"277alert the people of their area as to what needs to be done and will sortit out themselves, whenever possible. You could set up aNeighbourhood Council where you live, today. Through this, youcould co-ordinate the care of the people in your area by the people inyour area. There is no need to wait for the crash. It is a tragedy thatso many do not even know who lives in the flat next door, let alone atthe end of the street. Centralisation and the system of divide and rule,have brought this about. It is time to change this but it will not beeasy. It will take commitment and there will be many people who fearparticipation because they have been programmed to believe thatthey are here to follow, not to lead. But, these changes will happenbecause circumstances and awakening consciousness will demandthem. The more we can de4ink from the system now and prepare thegroundwork for community organisation, the smoother the transitionwill be.* Neighbourhood Councils will have a representative on theCommunity Council. How big an area these Community Councilswill cover will be decided by the people involved, in consultationwith other communities around them. I would see electedCommunity Councils working alongside community forums. Theseforums would be open to everyone to present their views andsuggestions for ways of improving the community. They would allowthe knowledge and ingenuity of people to be given a hearing. Today,we have professional politicians making decisions about subjectsthey know little or nothing about. Those who are close to thesesubjects are never asked to speak in the debates or to offer theirinsight into problems which they work with every day. Giving peoplethat opportunity in the present system of centralised control is almostimpossible because there are too many people involved. But, in acommunity situation, that would not be the case. Everything wouldtake place on a human scale. Even now, under the present system,there is no reason why community forums could not be organised togive a platform for local views and action. Indeed, this is happeningas awakening people follow their instincts.The elected Community Council would attend these regular forumsand listen to the people they represent. The councils would consist ofpeople elected from right across society. Besides representatives fromeach neighbourhood there would be the opportunity for all sectionsof society to have an elected spokesperson -food producers,"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"278shopkeepers, employees, environmental groups, young people, oldpeople, and so on.I would suggest a similar dual approach to economic organisation.Elected representatives to a community economic cooperative wouldcoordinate the day-to-day organisation and development of thecommunity economy while an economic forum would alloweveryone to contribute to the discussions on economic matters.People are much more enthusiastic and motivated when they knowthey have the opportunity to contribute and make a difference. Youwill be amazed at how many apparently insuperable problems can besolved once human ingenuity is harnessed to its full potential. Thetask for these community economies in the transition period will beto provide food, shelter, warmth and clothing for everyone and to doit in ways that are environmentally sustainable.* I would see the main roles of Regional Government to be thefollowing: To support the communities in their efforts to be self-reliant in all essentials; to ensure that essentials which cannot beprovided locally are provided from surpluses in other communities;to coordinate necessary trade between communities to the mutualbenefit of both; to be a forum for communities to exchangeinformation and experiences; to pass on details of new discoveriesand technology which would benefit communities and add to theirself reliance; to arbitrate in disagreements between communities; andto ensure that the actions of one community do not adversely affectanother, either economically or environmentally. The regional levelwill be particularly important in the transition period in organisingfood distribution to the big urban areas which do not have enoughfood-growing land to feed themselves.* I do not believe the present national governments, as such, willbe necessary, although groups of regions may choose to get togetherto support each other. The next level of representation after regionalcould be continental. These would be areas covered today by theEuropean Community or the United States and Canada -that sort ofsize. I would see these as forums and coordinators, not governments.This is very different from the present European Community modelwhich is little more than an economic trading bloc with system-serving and centralising motivations. The continental forum I amthinking of would be a meeting place where regional representativescould exchange ideas and discuss issues of mutual interest. This levelwould arbitrate on disagreements between regions, ensure that one"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"279region was not harming others economically and environmentally,and help to identify and direct the essentials of food, warmth,clothing and shelter to regions who were not yet self-reliant or whowere struggling, temporarily, from the effects of natural disasters.They would also coordinate relief operations in places where naturaldisasters had occurred, with expertise, transport and technology onpermanent standby to be on the scene in the shortest possible time.This would be a kind of Global International Rescue which allcommunities and regions could call upon.* The other level of representation would be the World Forum. Thisis not the same as World Government. It would be a place whererepresentatives from the continental forums would meet to discusstopics that affected the whole world. It would arbitrate indisagreements between continents and co-ordinate the provision ofessentials which a continent was unable, at any stage, to provide foritsel£ The World Forum would have no army at its disposal and, apartfrom powers to intervene to prevent environmental degradation thathad global implications, it would have no other power to impose itsdecisions. All armies will be dismantled when the transformation ofconsciousness is well underway. I would also see the World Forum asa body that would represent the planet in formal interaction withother Universal Civilisations which are going to be openly visitingthis planet and we theirs in the future just as we visit other countriestoday. We desperately need forms of democracy that empower andinvolve all people. The present ‘democracies’ were created by theBrotherhood with built-in flaws to ensure they were only illusions offreedom:“All these so called ‘People’s Rights’ can exist only in idea, an ideawhich can never be realised in practical lift.

People, as a rule, do not wish to pollute theirown neighbourhood. National governments give permission forpolluting factories to be imposed only on those communities wherethey don’t have to live themselves. The main motivation of a nationalgovernment is economic growth, not the wishes of one community.With decision-making transferred to community level, the incentivesto reject polluting technology are far greater. If you are seeking to beself-reliant you are going to look after your environment as a firstpriority because that is your self-reliance. The link between asustainable environment and a sustainable economy will be staringyou in the face every day.This structure is not a model for the future written in stone. I haveonly outlined a few ideas to illustrate some of the trends that arealready quietly underway and which will come to the fore as thetransition proceeds to challenge the Brotherhood nightmare of centralcontrol. I expect the economics and representation of the future to bemuch more diverse than a single, set structure. In every communityand region there will be variations on the theme of self-reliance inessentials and decision-making at the lowest level possible. Therewill be many difficulties and complications to overcome becausethese trends are faced with a world that has been geared and createdto serve a very different system. Communities and regions do notbreak down into neatly packaged units with the ideal ratio offarmland to people. We have appalling urban sprawls and it will besome time before anything like the ideas I have put forward will bereality world-wide. There will be a lot of chaos, hard work andlearning from experience before that can happen. What we can do ismake a start now and try to de-link ourselves as much from thesystem as we can.It is worth noting again that the fewer material wants we have theless we need to work and earn to live. This frees more time for us todo what we really want to do. If we simplify our material lives wegive ourselves choices which are denied us if we work, work, work tochase the material dream and its symbols of ‘success’. We need tofree ourselves from the so-called work ethic. This insists that, unlesswe are in paid employment all day, at least five days a week, we arelazy and work-shy. What rubbish.

Music, in particular, has a fundamental role toplay in using its vibrations to raise the frequency of the planet,although it can be used to do the opposite in the wrong hands. We aregoing to discover more notes and tones as the changes gather pace.People think that the collapse of the present order will see us livingin caves and tents for evermore. But the release of human creativitywill lead us into a world of abundance. Being poor is not purity, it ispoverty, and we will have the means to remove this cancer. Ours willbe a world that celebrates and encourages beauty, style andexcellence in all things. The idea, put forward by some, that livingrough has some kind of spiritual street-cred is a delusion, I feel. Thetransformation is about balance while poverty is an obvious sign ofimbalance within a society.Two areas related to political and economic change are the mediaand what we laughingly call justice. The media, or most of it, is thepropaganda machine of the present system. Nowhere do themainstream newspapers, magazines, radio and television programmesquestion the obsession with growth and free trade, except in therarest of circumstances. The only questions they ask are how best tostimulate both. They never ask why these things are so desirable andwhat the consequences of them are. The media depends on thesystem to survive and offers all the support it can. It is alsoBrotherhood-controlled. The media has allowed itself to become thevehicle for selling the American (Brotherhood) culture to the world.In its raw state, the media is like knowledge. It is neither negative orpositive. It is how it is used that is negative and positive. Someindividuals in the media already do some outstanding work, exposingexploitation and hypocrisy and highlighting injustices that need to beaddressed - but they are a depressing few. Local radio stations can bewonderful sources of information close to the people and they aregoing to be crucial in times of turmoil and change. The media couldbe used to communicate understanding and information that wouldfree humanity. Instead, its overwhelming contribution is to imprisonour thinking because its own thinking is imprisoned.“We must comple the governments of the goyim to take action in thedirection fovoured by our widely conceived plan, already approachingthe desired consummation, by what we shall represent as publicopinion, secretly prompted by us through the means of that so called"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"282‘Great Power’ - the Press, which, with a few exceptions that may bedisregarded, is already entirely in our hands.” (Illuminati Protocol 7).“What is the part played by the Press today?

Theyare de4inked from their higher selves and locked within a mediastructure that programmes them to programme others with theirtrivia, drivel, untruths, narrow vision and Brotherhood propaganda.When they leave the confines of the physical body they will behorrified at how they have allowed the system to control them. Mostjournalists are puppets of fear and negative thought patterns, but theydon’t have to be. They are not bad people. They are misguided andthey have the choice to change. Fortunately, the awakening process isthere for everyone and many journalists are opening theirconsciousness to new ideas. Their problem is getting past the editorsand the newspaper owners who block information because they don’twant to hear it or allow others to hear it.

Along with economics and politics, we haveseen the centralisation of media power into Brotherhood hands. Theycontrol the world’s news agencies that feed information to newspapersand the broadcast media all over the planet.The Brotherhood media serves the Brotherhood bankers. I have nodoubt, either, that intelligence services like the CIA have thetechnology to use television broadcasts to send subliminal messagesinto our non-conscious mind, without us, or even the televisionstation concerned, being aware of it. In 1994 a Polish radio stationbegan to send out an inaudible sound on its frequency to clear ofmosquitos the homes tuned to that station. It was, apparently, veryeffective in doing so, but thousands of listeners started to complainthat it was also driving their cats mad. If they can do that to insectsand cats, they can do it to humans. What is really coming out of someof the explosion of radio and television stations around the world?I ask this ofjournalists or the ones who can’t see that they are beingused as propaganda poodles: Are you going to go on meekly servingyour masters, or are you going to rebel? If you only realised what theNew World Order has in mind for you and your media, you wouldtake a very large gulp!And where are the journalists’ unions in all this? I say to them:Get together, open your eyes, and stop cooperating. I cannot tellyou how much you will regret it if you don’t. I will be mostpleasantly surprised if such a journalistic rebellion does happen but,for now, on past experience, I will not be holding my breath.In the meantime, we have to provide alternative sources ofinformation, and stop buying newspapers. The alternatives areemerging in magazines and papers struggling into life across theworld. We also have access to a printing press - the photo copier -tonetwork information through communities and further afield. I havefound that radio is by far the best means of communicating in themedia as it is today. Newspapers distort by reflex action andtelevision is too often looking for items so short it is impossible tocommunicate effectively or in depth. I have found that radio offersthe time to speak at length and if it is live you are free from editing.What you say is what the listeners hear. The staple diet of many radiostations is the phone4n and you have the chance every day to ring upand comment on subjects from the perspective presented in this bookand countless others.

The media will not be able to resist this interest indefinitelybecause they will want to use it to increase sales and viewing figures.That will only further stimulate interest and help to awaken morepeople which, as a result, will speed the demise of the system on whichthe present media depends. In the communities of the future,communication of information will be much more diverse, both incontent and control.There will be a revolution in ‘justice’, too. The police-lawyer-jury-judge system serves and protects the status quo and it is run by theBrotherhood secret societies, especially the Freemasons. One highranking judge revealed the attitude behind our version of ‘justice’when he said that people wrongly convicted by the system should notbe released because it undermines public confidence in British justice.It takes massive ongoing campaigns over many years for thosewrongly imprisoned to be released. Some never are. In Britain thereare three people in prison for killing a newspaper boy called CarlBridgewater. A fourth has already died since he was wronglyconvicted. I covered this case when I worked for BBC Television.They are obviously innocent and the only reason they are still behindbars is that so many other wrongly convicted people have had to bereleased in the last few years and the authorities don’t want to open thecriminal justice system to yet more derision. They want to put as muchtime as they can between those other high-profile releases and theinevitable release of ‘the Bridgewater Three’. Never mind that thispolicy demands that three people innocent of the crime for which theywere convicted spend even longer in prison. The System comes first.Government ministers and officials who should have no influencein the courts or public inquiries meddle as much as they can whencertain sentences or decisions would suit them politically. SomeHome Secretaries make known their feelings in these cases, and thisis communicated unofficially down the line and through thefreemason’s network to the judge. Not every judge takes notice, butmany do. It’s good for their career prospects and helps theBrotherhood. It is far from unknown for judges to be influenced intheir sentencing and decisions by the secret signs that tell him thedefendant or lawyer is a fellow freemason. When public inquiries areorganised to hear objections into road projects that devastatecommunities and the environment, governments make sure aninspector who sympathises with their view is appointed to hear theobjections and reject them. If people only knew what goes on behind"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"286the scenes, the robots would have rebelled a long time ago.The winners in this charade of democracy and justice are thesystem and the legal profession which is alive with freemasons, as isthe police force. It is run for the professions and the elite, not by adesire for fairness. The costs of going to court to pursue justice havelong entered fantasy land. Most people have to concede their rightsbecause they can’t afford to pursue them. This gives all the aces tothose with money. They can afford to buy theirjustice. The majoritycannot. Even legal aid which is supposed to help the poorest to payfor legal representation is being cut back at every opportunity.Meanwhile the leading lawyers and the judges take home oftenenormous salaries from a system that most people cannot afford touse.I was once involved in a civil case which should never have got tocourt. This happens, however, when one side is willing to negotiateand the other is not. All the costs in the case were awarded againstme. Given the circumstances and the background that wasoutrageous, but that’s another story. My own legal costs were £1,500.The other side’s costs were estimated in court as about £2,000. Butwhen their final bill arrived from a firm of solicitors in Banbury,Oxfordshire, it had grown miraculously to almost £4,000! My shockat this was made worse when I read the bill. Only £1,576 of thatfigure was for work the firm had actually done. On top of that theyhad charged me for not using a barrister. No you didn’t misread that.I said not using a barrister. It was a straight forward case that anycompetent solicitor could have handled and, as I say, there was noneed for a court hearing, anyway. But because they were saying theycould have used a barrister had they chosen to, I had to pay for themnot doing so. No, I assure you I am not joking. It is quite within thelaw for them to do that.Also they charged me extra because I had ‘opposed their applicationthroughout’ and because of the ‘importance of the case to our client’. Ihad to pay and in effect be financially punished by a firm of solicitorsbecause I had challenged their demands and because it was animportant case for their client. As every client considers court hearingsto be extremely important to them, they could apply that added chargeto every case they handle. I had to pinch myself to believe this washappening, and so did my own lawyer who was as bewildered andappalled as I was. You can appeal to a court against legal bills whencosts have been awarded against you."},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"287It is called taxation. This I did and I was confident that the bill wasso silly and against all laws ofjustice and fair play that it would bereduced and sanity would return. The court did reduce the bill. Theyreduced it by £135 and I was charged £186 for the cost of them doingso!!!It struck me that this was one case in one court on one afternooninvolving one firm of lawyers. Just think what is going on in courtsin America and all over the world. How many people are beingcleaned out financially by pursuing their rights to justice ordefending themselves against injustice? It is one of the great ironiesthat members of the legal profession who spend their timeprosecuting or defending illegal theft are themselves responsible dayafter day for legalised theft. The legal system is in the same categoryas economics, politics, and most of the media. It is sick, corrupt,stupid, juvenile, self-destructing and brotherhood-controlled. Askthose many lawyers who are motivated by helping people and not bymaking as much money as possible and they will tell you the same. Iknow how frustrated these caring lawyers are at being forced tooperate in such a corrupt and corrupting system. But you see thesystem has to persuade us that we do have freedom, live in ademocracy, and have a fair system ofjustice. If it doesn’t maintainthat facade, we are more likely to rebel. It is time we did.Governments do not look honestly and deeply at the causes ofcrime because to do so would reveal that the ‘values’ necessary foreconomic growth are the very values that encourage crime andviolence. Instead they condemn law breakers, wash their hands ofresponsibility, and call for harsher punishments. The prisons areovercrowded because society is punishing the symptoms and notaddressing the cause. And what is the reaction of the growthmentality to crowded prisons? You got it. Build more prisons. InAmerica which claims to be the home of freedom, justice, andcivilisation, some states still send people to the electric chair or thefiring squad. This is not justice. It is barbarism. Opinion Polls (orrather opinion manipulators) in Britain continually show that themajority would bring back hanging for some crimes. What arroganceto think we have the right to take the life of another, and what mentalgymnastics it must require to say that killing is wrong and the stateshould kill anyone who does it!! Expect to see governments trying tointroduce more authoritarian laws in all countries as the decadeprogresses which further erode freedom. We must resist this,"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"288peacefully, but with great determination.The changing consciousness will reject the present methods of‘justice’. Crime will plummet when new values and measurements ofhuman success are accepted and personal achievement is notmeasured by possessions. The move towards local decision makmgand the involvement of all people in the life and direction ofcommunities will reduce negative behaviour still further. Therelinking with our higher levels and all that understanding, love, andwisdom, will have the biggest impact on the reduction of crime andnegative behaviour. Before that time arrives, we need to look at whypeople act in the negative ways they do. Why have people been sode-humanised that they can mug and maim frail old ladies. The wayto change that is not to use the fear of incarceration in somegrotesque prison that will further de-humanise them. It is to treatthem in ways that re-humanise their values and spirit. If someoneattacks an old lady, the way to stop them doing it again is to putthem, under supervision initially, into situations where they meet andwork with old people. This will allow them to see that those theymug are not meaningless, worthless, victims for those of greaterphysical strength. They are human beings with feelings.I see mediation within the community replacing courts and lawyersand ludicrous legal bills in the decades that follow the turn of theMillennium. The number of laws will diminish as will the numbersrequired to administer them. You don’t need laws to say you must notpollute, when human consciousness has reached a level that wouldnot dream of harming the Earth in any way. Nor do you need laws topunish violence when there is no violence, because all life is seen assacred. In the years before that I believe that more and moreawakening people will refuse to cooperate with the economic,political, and legal systems in ever-increasing numbers. The systemdepends on mass subservience and unquestioning cooperation tosurvive. You can arrest a dozen people for a peaceful protest. Youcannot arrest 100,000. Cooperation is the basis of the new world, butit has to be two-way. One-way cooperation leads only to exploitation.A refusal to cooperate with exploitation will be another way thesystem will fall.Writing about the themes of the future is difficult because therewill be distinct phases of change. In the short term the breakdown ofthe old will bring chaos, confusion, and fear.

The Brotherhood will be encouraging crime, evenstimulating it through its mind-controlling technology, because itwants the public to demand a more authoritarian police force withlaws to match. We may see martial law, military coups, and internalconflicts increase around the world. Many will be looking around forsomeone to blame for this mayhem, and the encouragement of racialand ethnic prejudice will result. Most human minds have beenprogrammed to hand over responsibility to others. Amid theconfusion of change, they will look to any strong leader to tell themwhat to do. This is fertile soil for dictators. There will be tensions,sometimes severe, between those serving the status quo and thosemoving with the frequencies. The way they see life and what theywish to do will be in conflict. It is up to awakening people to avoidviolence in these circumstances. The last thing we need is morenegative energy adding to the extremes we already have. In contrastto these negative aspects of the transition, we will see the expansionin positive behaviour from those following the frequencies. Thesepeople will be healing divisions wherever they can. Old barriersbetween those of different colours, creeds, and ways of life, will beno more among those tuning in. This will be the new consciousnessemerging from the death throes of the old.In the medium term, as the System sinks beneath a tidal wave ofchange, I feel the community and regional economies will bestabilising and order will return. By this time, the world populationwill have fallen rapidly, with more going out of incarnation thancoming in. Those who hold out against the frequencies and close theirminds will have left the planet as they fall behind the quickeningvibrations. The level of consciousness that will inherit the Earth willbe meek, in that it will not use violence or imposition, but it will bementally and emotionally strong and wise. When the chaos subsidesand calmness returns to the weather, the surface of the Earth, andhumanity in general, beings of advanced evolution will arrive in largenumbers to assist the development of the new societies.Much further into the future, the world will be unrecognisable fromthe one we see today and even from what I envisage for the mediumperiod. The frequencies will have risen to levels ofknowledge andunderstanding that will give humanity the ability to manifest and de-manifest, to travel across space and time at will, to create through thepower of thought, and to be dependent on nothing except the energyof life itself By then we will not even require food as we know it.

If only we knew howprimitive some of those wonders really are.There is such a difference between the ‘science’ we are told aboutand that which we are not. We have the establishment scientistsbelieving they are at the cutting edge of human understanding whilein the secret underground bases technology exists that would blowtheir minds. Literally, some of it.Take our sources of energy, as created by the science we are allowedto know about. We rape and devastate the Earth collecting oil, gases,and clumps of matter. We release the energy held inside them byburning what we have collected. In doing this we lose much or most ofthe energy they contain and we create horrendous pollution thatpoisons our air and water and damages our forests. The alternative is tobuild blocks of concrete called Nuclear Power Stations. These createwaste that is lethal for up to 24,000 years and probably far longer. No-one knows what to do with this waste, but we go on producing it. Oneof the by products is plutonium. One thousandth of a gram of this isfatal and if enough gets into the hands of a terrorist or dictator theycould make a nuclear bomb. Oh yes, and should these power stationsleak or explode as with Chernobyl, substantial areas of land becomeuninhabitable and incapable of supplying food. Thousands, possiblymillions, will die sooner or later from radiation poisoning or cancerand there’s a good chance that babies born to those affected will bedeformed. And this is called scientific advance? It is, rather, ascientific smokescreen. A deadly one.The Brotherhood at the highest human level made a definite decisionto create support the myth that there is no such thing as spirit or aneternal sel£ It knew that wasn’t true, but that knowledge was forthem, not the people whom they wanted to control.

Another rigidbelief system had to take its place, and anyway, they preferred forpeople to think they were nothing, but lumps of meat. One of theBrotherhood’s creations was the famous Royal Society in Britain. Itopened its doors in the late seventeenth century and has been awonderful vehicle for selling the quite hysterical idea that only thephysical world exists. Goodbye God. The media have once againplayed their part like the good lap dogs they have chosen to be andthey still treat the words of a ‘scientist’ as solid gold truth. They arescientists after all, and they are very clever people who know morethan we do. I know you don’t understand the jargon, but don’t worryyour little head about it. You just get on with your life and let thescientists us tell you how things are. They know best.What a negative affect this has had on human life. We are backagain to the five senses. The collective mind of ‘public’ science isconvinced that this physical world is the only one that exists. Theyhave ridiculed anyone, even members of their own profession, whohave questioned this and the Brotherhood have arranged for much ofthat onslaught against real scientists. A science in this state ofmisunderstanding will obviously concentrate its research on theworld of the five senses. Its ‘advances’ over the last 200 years or sohave been in understanding some of the potential to exploit thephysical environment. From the perspective of this physical level ithas achieved some remarkable feats. It has landed on the Moon (wellafter the secret scientists did, however), developed endless gadgets,and found ways to treat the symptoms, though less often the causes,of some illnesses. But by ignoring or dismissing the existence ofother non physical levels of people and the planet, it has given itselfa very limited and lopsided view of Creation. Sadly it has done thesame for billions of people. Far from advancing understanding, it hasheld it back by undermining the efforts of the more enlightenedscientists and people working with psychic sources who challengethe this-is-all-there-is view of life.Say someone goes missing and you organise a search party. Youchoose not to look in the area where the person is lost and discourageor prevent anyone else from looking there. If anyone does youridicule and condemn them when they say ‘I’ve found him’.

But you won’t find the one you are supposed to besearching for because he is lost in the area where you refuse to look.If you take the ‘missing person’ to be symbolic of the mysteries oflife and the search party to be mainstream science, you have thereason why those so called ‘mysteries’ are still unanswered byscience.Had they not done this and had they had the humility to listen, wewould be much further along the road to solving our problems. Infact many of them would not have been created in the first place.Science is part of the problem when it could, and should, be part ofthe solution. If it had not been so obsessed with the physical worldalone or been so arrogant in dismissing alternative thought, we wouldalready have the technology to provide all the power and warmth weneed by harnessing the Ocean of Energy all around us. We would notbe destroying the planet for our heat and light. The knowledge ofhow to tap into the non-physical, sub-atomic, energies that surroundus is available today, but the scientific establishment and the systemin general does not want to know.The reason is that what we call ‘science’ is system-led. It is fundedby, and owes its livelihood to, the system and the Brotherhood, whichis following its own agenda. When I wrote It Doesn’t Have To BeLike This, half the world’s scientists were involved in weaponsresearch, and most of the rest were researching technologies to servetake, make and throwaway. The Lucifer-controlled system does notwant us to know who we are and science has played its rolebrilliantly. It has denied the existence of our true selves andencouraged us to believe we are just a cosmic accident. People whoknow they are eternal beings of light and love, on an endless journeyof evolution through experience, are not so easy to manipulate andcontrol. Science has also been the System’s mad professor, producingall the potions, poisons, and technology that have so affected theplanet. The System is based on oil and other fossil fuels, and with thehelp of science it has managed to protect these energy sources fromthe knowledge that would replace them with non destructivealternatives. I do not wish to decry the achievements that scientistshave made in some areas, but the overall contribution of mainstream‘public’ science has been to suppress human understanding and touse its knowledge for destructive, rather than constructive, purposes."},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"294The story of science has mirrored that of religion in many ways.Both decided on a creed and belief which they then imposed upon theworld and both have sought to block all efforts to present informationand evidence which exposes their misunderstandings. But then bothare controlled by the same masters which have ensured that both cansurvive only by suppression. Once they painted their colours to themast and proclaimed one unyielding dogma, their empires, funding,power, and influence have been dependent on the survival of thatdogma in the minds of enough people. Suppression of informationand understanding becomes essential to their continued existence. Ifyou are a scientist who depends for his living on the current scientificdogma, the desire to block alternative explanations which wouldshatter that dogma, can be very compelling. The System, no doubtwith considerable Brotherhood influence, has ensured that these keyareas like science, politics, economics, the media, and religion mustsuppress truth if they are to survive. In suppressing that truth, theymust also promote a destructive illusion for the robots to focus on.The media slavishly support them by communicating the myth thatestablishment science is at the cutting edge of human understanding.I wrote to all the BBC Television science programmes summarisingthe work of open minded scientists who are convinced the generalthemes of consciousness and frequencies set out in this book are true.I offered to put the programmes in touch with these people. I wrote toinvestigative programmes like ‘World In Action’ with the sameinformation. Only one even bothered to reply, and that was only tosay that in effect they did not cover topics that were not accepted bymainstream science! Game, set, and match to mind control.James Lovelock is one open-minded scientist who has challengedconvention. He has put forward the theory of ‘Gaia’, the Greek namefor the Earth Goddess. This theory proposes that the Earth, far frombeing dead matter, is a living, thinking, organism. I would go muchfurther than Lovelock, but there is a great deal of what he says thatfits in with the overall themes I am putting forward. In his book TheAges of Gaia he explains why science is system rather thaninformation led:“You may think of the academic scientist as the analogue of theindependent artist. In foct, nearly all scientists are employed by somelarge organisation, such as a governmental department, a university,or a multinational company. Only rarely are they free to express their"},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"295science as a personal view. They may think that they are free, but inreality they are, nearly all of them, employees; they have tradedfreedom of thought for good working conditions, a steady income,tenure, and a pension. They are also constrained by an army ofbureaucratic forces, from the funding agencies to the health and safityorganisations. Scientists are also constrained by an army ofbureaucratic forces, from the funding agencies to the health andsafrty organisations. Scientists are also constrained by the tribal rulesof discipline to which they belong. A physicist would find it hard to dochemistry and a biologist would find physics well-nigh impossible todo. To cap it all, in recent years the ‘purity’ of science is ever moreclosely guarded by a selfiimposed inquisition called ‘the peer review’.This well-meaning but narrow minded nanny of an institution ensuresthat scientists work according to conventional wisdom and not ascuriosity or inspiration moves them. Lacking freedom they are indanger of succumbing to a finicky gentility or of becoming, likemediaeval theologians, the creatures of dogma.“As a university scientist I would have found it nearly impossible todo full time research on the Earth as a living planet. To start with,there would be no funds approved for so speculative a research. If Ihad persisted and worked in my lunch hour or spare time, it would nothave been long before I received a summons from the lab director. Inhis office I would have been warned of the dangers to my career ofpersisting in so unfashionable a research topic. If this did not workand obstinately I persisted, I would have been summoned a secondtime and warned that my work endangered the reputation of thedepartment, and the directors own career.”Control the funding and the lab director and you control what isinvestigated and what isn’t. That is what the Brotherhood does. Thisall-knowing science has been with us for such a short time in humanevolution. It is only very recently that some of the planets have been‘discovered’. Neptune was not identified until 1846 and they didn’tknow Pluto was there until 1930. There are more planets still to findin this Solar System, and thousands if not millions of other suchsystems across the Universe. If you took the Sun be the same size asan orange, then on that same scale the nearest star outside of thisSolar System would be 3,000 miles away! To think we canpontificate on details about the Universe and dismiss the idea thatthere are other universal civilisations is just beyond belief. Scientific"},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"296understanding is in its infancy. It is like a small child forcing its viewof the world on everyone else. When you look at its ‘big bang’ theoryfor the Universe, the explosion of a ‘Cosmic Egg’ of matter whichthey say formed the universe, it is incredibly naive. It is founded oncalculations that other galaxies are speeding away from this one. Theimplication being, conventional thinking believes, that they are stillbeing forced away by the power of the original explosion. It is a verytenuous hook on which to hang a theory that has become accepted bymany as ‘fact’. Galaxies are moving because everything is in orbit.Much of the scientific ‘advancement’ of the modern world is merelythe confirmation of what the ancients already knew, because spacevisitors and channelled communicators told them.Science is not as clever as it thinks it is, but far from showing thehumility necessary for open minded research, it has consistentlydismissed even its own profession when they have predicted newpossibilities. They don’t understand something and so they arrogantlysay it cannot happen. An Astronomer Royal said that talk of spacetravel was ‘utter bilge’ just eighteen months before the RussianSputnik was orbiting the Earth, and that was primitive compared withwhat secret science was doing! As another astronomer, Carl Sagan,once said: “Intellectual capacity is no guarantee against being deadwrong”. If; however, alternative explanations are systematicallysuppressed everyone else is encouraged to be dead wrong also.But the dyke is collapsing for science as it is for all expressions ofthe system. From without, the evidence continues to mount throughnear death experiences and ‘inexplicable’ phenomena, that reveal thelimitations of understanding and vision at the core of ‘public’scientific theory. And from within, the open-minded, genuine,scientists who seek to unlock the mysteries of Creation are beinginspired by the rising consciousness to accept what psychics havebeen saying for so long. These twin pressures on scientific dogmawill bring current scientific ‘thinking’ and its empire of influence anddelusion crashing down in this decade and the next one.With the genuine scientists now tuning into the higher frequencies,the understanding of who we are and the nature of life is awakeningin their consciousness. This is leading them into areas of inquiry thatwill unlock the mysteries for them. The establishment will try toresist their findings, but it will make no difference.

The supporters of today’s view ofphysics have closed their minds to the non-physical levels ofexistence and ignored 99.99 per cent of Creation. No wonder theirunderstanding is so limited. How tragic that scientists like SirWilliam Crookes, Sir Oliver Lodge, and many others had identifiedthe basic answers to many of the mysteries scientifically much earlierin this century, but were ignored and attacked by Brotherhoodsupporters, as were the psychics who have known for thousands ofyears what today’s system-serving scientists still don’t know. Morethan 2,000 years ago the Greek philosophers understood theprinciples of life and Creation before Christianity, Islam, and othersarrived on the scene.The rising consciousness will sweep away the delusions andpresent us with technology beyond our dreams. There will be noneed for fossil fuels, electricity pylons, or even the ‘alternative’sources like wind and wave power. Each home will have a device,perhaps no bigger than a shoe box, which will harness the Earth’senergy field to provide all the power and warmth we need. It willnot have to be plugged into a grid. It will work independentlyanywhere you wish to take it. Transport will be revolutionised andmade non-polluting by using the same understanding. We will havethe knowledge to travel through time. Space travel will be likecatching a bus today. The idea that we are alone in the Universe willseem as ludicrous as believing the Earth is flat. Later will come allthe ‘miraculous’ feats like manifesting and demanifesting, which Ihave already spoken of.How do I know? Because most of it is already happening today,suppressed or in secret, and has been for decades. Free energy is afact. By that I mean technologies that provide unlimited supplies ofenergy without using any fuel themselves. They access the ocean ofpower in the Earth’s energy field and other energies all around usand produce no pollution and no environmental degradationwhatsoever. You need no coal mines, no oil rigs, no power stations,nuclear or otherwise, and no ugly power lines in a national grid.These technologies can be used to heat and power homes,businesses, vehicles, anything. We talk of the ‘electric vehicle’running on batteries, when the brilliant Croatian scientist NikolaTesla ran a car in New York with a form of free energy technologyin 1931, and man called John Worrel Keely of Philadelphiademonstrated his ‘Dynaspheric Force’ free energy machine in New"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"298York in the 1890s! While investigating the magnetic forces flowingbetween the Earth’s, poles, he discovered that ‘corpuscles of matter’could be divided by vibration and the principle used to drive amotor.The inventors of free energy technology have always sufferedsuppression and some have been harassed in other ways. One, JohnSearl, was jailed for his trouble. In 1946, when he was only 14, hebuilt his Searl Effect Generator (SEG) which was inspired by a dreamhe had as a boy. It was based on a magnetic device, and it generatedusable electricity. As he perfected his creation, Searl also began tobuild flying craft using the same power system which could outperform even today’s conventional air and space craft. Three monthsbefore he planned to build a craft for a manned flight, he was jailedfor using his own free electricity and not paying the power companyto use theirs! While Searl was in prison on this outrageous charge,the authorities burned all his papers. The Brotherhood and theSystem in general is desperate to stop these technologies, becausethey will remove our dependence for fuel and warmth and the wholecover-up of their technology will begin to come to light. Many freeenergy inventors are refused patents, and their work can be classifiedby an international ‘Military Use Refuse’ law which can stop themfrom publishing their findings or promoting their technology. But theBrotherhood elite know all about it, because the information goes totheir secret scientists.How appalling to think that while old people shiver from the coldand die from hypothermia because they can’t afford their heatingbills, the ability to produce limitless energy for free is suppressed toserve the interests of some perverted elite. In Britain, fuel bills haveincreased enormously after a new tax was added, and people sufferill health from the pollution caused by this primitive burning offossil fuels. Meanwhile the answer is blocked and has been fordecades. Where are you politicians? Where are youjournalists?Where are you environmental groups?

The free energy technology of the Illuminatielite is further ahead of anything the public know about as it is inother scientific knowledge.

They know about energies andfrequencies. It may be a version twisted by other misunderstanding,but they know the real laws of physics. I am not saying this nextstory is all accurate, it may be disinformation, but it will give yousome idea of how far ahead Illuminati scientists are of ’Goyim’scientists.Franklin D Roosevelt was a close friend of Nikola Tesla, thescientific genius who was to say that much of his knowledge camefrom ETs. One of Tesla’s students, Guglielmo Marconi, set up asecret group which claimed to have built ‘flying saucers in the 1940s,and to have landed on the Moon in the early 1950s. Interestingly, anumber of Marconi scientists and others working in similar areashave strange and inexplicable deaths. Roosevelt asked Tesla, someresearchers claim, to become the director of a project which is nowknown as the Philadelphia Experiment. His number two was Dr JohnVon Neumann and the team based themselves at Princeton Universitybefore everything was moved to the Brooklyn Naval Yard in 1940and code named Project Rainbow. The brief was to make anAmerican ship invisible both to the radar and the human eye. Theyachieved this with a mine sweeper by generating intense magneticfields. Tesla was given a battleship for his next experiment in 1942,but protested when he learned that this time there would be a crew onboard. He felt they would be in danger and, it seems certain, hesabotaged the test which didn’t work. Tesla left and ten months laterhe was said to have been found dead in his New York hotel room.Von Neumann took over and on July 20th, 1943, he conducted theexperiment again on the US destroyer escort, ‘The Eldridge’.It worked, but the crew went hysterical and were sick. VonNeumann asked for more time to perfect the technology, but theChief of Naval Operations insisted it was finished by August 12th,1943, because they wanted to use this capability in the war. He said,however, that he would accept only radar invisibility. This theyachieved in Philadelphia Harbor, but then after a blue flash, theEldridge disappeared for three hours. Now it gets complicatedbecause we are about to cross frequencies of time and space. Twoyoung scientists on board, Edward and Duncan Cameron, came ondeck to find the crew suffering from extreme hysteria and the two ofthem jumped overboard. The story claims that they didn’t land inwater, but in the Montauk Army Base on New York’s Long Island"},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"300where they realised that it was now 1983 - forty years later. Yes, Iknow it sounds crazy, but stay with me!The general background to the Philadelphia Experiment has beentold in a feature film, and the basic themes of it are said to be correct.In the underground centre at Montauk the Camerons were taken tosee Von Neumann, now of course a much older man than the one theyhad known in 1943. Von Neumann was reported to have died in1957, but that was part of the cover for his work. He told them thatthey had to be transported back in time to the Eldridge in 1943 tosmash the equipment because the experiment had created a ‘bubblein hyperspace which threatened to cause catastrophe on thisfrequency. Von Neumann had by now (1983), perfected thetechnology for time travel thanks to the extraterrestrial input sincethe 1950s, this story claims. The Camerons were transported back tothe ship and 1943 where they smashed the equipment. When thathappened, the Eldridge reappeared physically. See, I said it wascomplicated, and it’s even more so when you read the full story asdocumented in other books. It is hard to comprehend all this if weremain stuck with our version of time rather than a version in whichthe past, present, and projected future are happening together.Perhaps most amusing was the fact that when Cameron, back in1943, told Von Neumann what had happened to him in 1983, his bossrefused to believe him!Again I say that I am not suggesting that I believe every word ofthis. I don’t know. There are some amazing stories coming out, but Ido believe that at least the Illuminati scientists are working in thesesort of areas, including inter-frequency and, possibly, time travel.It is said that when the Eldridge returned to the physical world of1943, it was a nightmare to behold. The time-space-molecularsynchronisation had been so scrambled by what happened that manyof the crew members were found to be part of the superstructure ofthe ship. Others were insane and still others would disappear or burstinto flames. Talk about cleverness without wisdom. The madprofessors are out of control. The researchers making these claimssay the project was stopped after the Eldridge disaster and VonNeumann went to Los Alamos to work on the development of theAtomic Bomb. But by 1947 curiosity, and the potential for powerpresented by what had been learned in the Philadelphia Experimentgot the better of them. It was re-started under Von Neumann asProject Phoenix at the Brookhaven National Laboratories in New"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"301York. He also worked with the recovery of the crashed space craftand extra-terrestrials, like the one near Roswell. Some researcherssay that a number of craft were deliberately brought down by theAmerican military, when they realised how they could be seriouslydestabilised. Von Neumann and Dr.Vannevar Bush were two whoworked with the extraterrestrial from the Roswell crash known asEBE, it is suggested.The development of Project Phoenix into the 1980s has, someclaim, produced the knowledge and technology to travel throughtime. One story says they have travelled forward in time, but whenthey reach 2011 everything enters a dream-like state. 2011 links inwith the predictions of the Maya and others for the time of greatchange. There is so much speculation, and looking at the themesrather than all of the detail, claim and counter-claim, is probably farmore productive. It is further said that Von Neumann and the secretscientists have also perfected the technique of making a person olderor younger by breaking their ‘time lock’. Tesla was working on timelocks before he died, or disappeared. We are time4ocked at birth intothis frequency’s version of time. On physical death, the time lockbreaks and we are free to move on to other space-time worlds.Without this time lock during a physical life it would be chaos, andthe sort of things that happened to the crew of the Eldridge would behappening to all of us. But if you can remove the time lock in acontrolled way, you can advance or regress the age of the physicalbody, or so some investigators have said. The Brotherhood elite knowhow to change the weather in a limited way, and from the grotesqueexperiments they carry out on their abducted victims these insanescientists also know how to create clones. Some of the ‘little greys’which people often report seeing could be from their laboratory andI’m sure they have developed the ability to create a human body,Frankenstein style. To think we are having discussions about themorality of genetic engineering while this is going on! Thousands ofpeople go missing in the world every year and are never seen again.A number of them, I have no doubt, end up in the undergroundlaboratories.Their understanding of anti-gravity technology - space craft - isnow very advanced and many of the UFO sightings we hear aboutwill be craft being tested and flown by human pilots. The bright lightor glow around a UFO as reported by so many people is caused bythe magnetic field produced by some craft which distorts the"},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"302gravitation field to create anti-gravity. There are many differenttechnologies that these craft use to harness the natural energy fields.Think what such knowledge could do in the right hands. It couldbring an end to poverty, suffering and environmental degradation,We could be travelling from Britain to Germany in five minutes,Britain to Australia in half an hour or less. Leaving today’sdestructive insanity behind will not mean poverty for everyone, asthe present system collapses. We have the choice to have a life madeeasier by amazing, non-destructive, technology that will dumppoverty, hunger, and homelessness into the dustbin of history whereit belongs. This we will do because these misguided men and theirextra-terrestrial masters are not going to win. The transformation,with help from all levels, is going to remove their manipulation, andthey will have to wait for another opportunity to work out their vastimbalances. They will do their damndest to cause havoc over thenext 20 years or so, but their control of this planet is coming to itsconclusion.There needs to be a rebellion of science students - all students -inevery university, each coordinating with the others. They shoulddemand to know what knowledge is really available and reject therubbish they are being spoon fed to keep them in the dark. The samewith their lecturers, most of whom don’t know what is going oneither. Come on, get moving my friends. There is no time to lose.Don’t take no for an answer. Do it peacefully and with love, butensure it is underpinned by unbreakable determination. The robotsmust rebel, or you will regret it forever and a day.The medical students and other health employees need to do thesame. The way people suffer when there is no need, is one of thegreatest scandals of this story. As the transformation progresses, othermethods of healing will bring an end to the drug-obsessed, surgeryobsessed, disease care services of today. Once again medical sciencehas been directed to see only the physical level of being. It treatssymptoms and not causes, because it does not understand the causes.How can it when most illness results from imbalances on our non-physical levels and medical science insists those levels don’t exist? Itis known that people who live under or near power lines or haveclose contact with electromagnetic technology are more prone tocertain illnesses, particularly some cancers. Human science has noidea why this should be. But our non-physical self is a series ofelectromagnetic energy fields working as one. When we come into"},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"303close and consistent contact with other powerful electromagneticfields thrown out by power lines and technology, our subtle selvesare affected in various ways. This imbalance distorts the etheric bodywhich governs the workings of the physical. In turn the ethericorganisation is disrupted and the physical becomes imbalanced,resulting in cancer or another dis-ease. That is why the crew of theEldridge was so affected on all levels by the immenseelectromagnetic field they were subjected to.Even illness is used to serve the system. The Brotherhood-ownedor -controlled drug companies fund scientific research, and insist thatthe scientists they are funding look only for ways of treating diseasethrough drugs or technology that can be bought and sold. The worldis awash with tablets and potions, and the drug companies measuretheir profits in billions. Some of their gross markups are as high as90%. But the disease-care services are submerged by people who areill! When I was younger I had a doctor who hardly lifted his headlong enough to look at me before he was writing a prescription forsome drug or other. Representatives from the drug companies havemany ways to ‘encourage’ doctors to use their products. So manypeople are ill, physically or emotionally, that the disease-careservices are little more than conveyor belts cutting open andadministering drugs to the never-ending stream of system-createddisease that is passing by. The doctors and nurses are as much thevictims as the patients. For doctors and nurses, see economists,politicians, scientists andjournalists. They are programmed to thinkthe System’s way and do its bidding within the prison ofmisunderstanding it builds around them. But again many areawakening from this slumber.Nothing sums up better the conveyor belt mentality of medical carethan a circular sent out by a doctor’s practice on the Isle of Wight. Itsaid that patients were reminded that doctors appointments were forfive minutes only and this was not the time to discuss other problems.There you have it in a sentence. The fact that the ‘other problems’were likely to be the cause of their illness did not seem to register. Ifthere are imbalances in our eternal selves, especially at the emotionallevel, they will filter down through the chakra system to manifest asphysical disease or disease. Medical science reacts by throwing drugsat the symptoms while ignoring the cause. It accepts that stress andemotional problems can cause illness because the evidence isoverwhelming. But it rejects any idea of eternal consciousness and so"},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"304it cannot understand why stress causes disease. When they identify anemotional problem they prescribe Valium or other anti-depressants inan attempt to suppress the symptoms. What the patient really needs isfor the cause of their depression to be addressed. If you are depressedbecause you have poor housing you don’t need drugs you need adecent house. But instead of being a health service, the system hasturned doctors and nurses into medical garbage collectors, copingwith the human debris the system daily tips out. I am not condemningdoctors or anyone in the medical profession. What else can they dowhen their workload is such that they can give no more than fiveminutes to a patient and have no power to provide what the patientreally needs to remove their dis-ease?Preventative medicine which removes the causes of dis-ease beforethey become physical problems is largely ignored by the medicalestablishment, because to do what is necessary would mean re-thinking all its values and misguided principles. Instead, evenpreventing illness - or claiming to - is used to stoke the fires offinancial opportunism and exploitation. Did you know that thefluorides added to drinking water in the name of fighting tooth decaywere used as rat poison for nearly 40 years?Since the early 1900s industrial fluorines have been a majorpolluter of rivers and streams, poisoning land and animals. They are aby-product of the aluminium industry. In 1939 the Mellon Institute inthe USA asked Dr Gerald Cox to find a market for fluoride waste.Cox, a biochemist, suggested the idea of putting them in the publicdrinking water. This delighted his paymasters, the Melon Institute,because it was owned by the family of Andrew Mellon, the owner ofthe Aluminum Corporation of America (ALCOA). In 1944, OscarEwing was employed by ALCOA at an annual salary of $750,000,and this was fifty years ago! Within months he had moved on to bethe head of the Federal Security Agency and he began a campaign tohave fluoride added to public water supplies. By 1951, he hadpersuaded Congress that it was a good idea and was given twomillion dollars to start the work. You could not put this rat poisoninto rivers and streams because it was considered too dangerous, butyou could put it into water that people drank. This was great forALCOA, but terrible for the people, and this sort of covert wheeler-dealing is going on behind the politician-speak every day.This is dream land for drug companies. It is no surprise that one drug"},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"305company alone I saw increased its six monthly profits by 1.7 billiondollars. This adds greatly to the wealth of people like theRockefellers who own half the pharmaceutical industry in the USA,according to Nexus magazine. But such increases in profits have runparallel to the growth in drug-related illness. Dr Brian Strom,Associate Director of Medicine and Pharmacology at the Universityof Pennsylvania School of Medicine, estimates that the side effectsfrom drugs kill 160,000 Americans every year, and put 1.6 millioninto hospital. I’ve seen people I know prescribed pills for symptoms,and other to offset the effects of them. This is making the tills ringeven quicker for the drug companies. If medical science does notunderstand the true nature of the human being, how can it avoidcreating drugs that cause more harm than the original illness they aredesigned to treat? But then a drugged-up population is just what theBrotherhood wants. And how do we know what they are putting inthose drugs?The drug companies are terrified of alternatives to this madness.They portray alternative healers as ‘quacks’ who are potentiallydangerous when they, themselves, are often lethal. There are peoplewho call themselves alternative healers who are nothing of the kindand you have to be careful. But I don’t remember an alternativehealer coming up with Thalidomide which deformed so manybabies; nor do I recall them giving people drugs with side effectsthat ensure their victims will never be able to walk out in thesunshine again. Drug companies have done both and much more.Just as the oil companies and the Brotherhood seek to stop freeenergy technology, so the Brotherhood drug companies make everyeffort to discredit and destroy all cures that do not involve drugs.They don’t want a cure for cancer. They are making too muchmoney selling drugs to treat the symptoms of it. This is not abouthealth. It is about wealth.The Pharmaceutical Industry is one of the most corrupt andcorrupting organisations humanity invented. It is Brotherhood-controlled and one of the most sinister of its operations. Ian Sinclair,in his book You can overcome Asthma says that in 1972, acommission set up by the Chilean President, Salvador Allende (adoctor), reported that no more than two dozen drugs were actuallyeffective. The doctors on the commission proposed a dramaticreduction in drugs purchased from the companies, mostly American.Within a year, the junta with CIA support, had ousted Allende in a"},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"306coup. The doctors on the commission were killed, and the newregime recommenced business as usual with the drug companies. Theindustry controls the whole system - doctors, universities, research,government, health departments, the lot. And when they areprevented from marketing drugs which are exposed as dangerous,they dump them on the Third World. So, everyone involved inmedicine, are you going to continue to take all this, or are you goingto get together and do something?AIDS is a massive earner for the drug industry. They even leakedclaims about ‘cures’ to boost their share price as people invest in acompany in the hope that they will make lots of money when the‘cure’ is marketed. They do this with other ‘cures’ too, and themedia poodle barks to its master’s tune again by running stories ofdrug research projects on the verge of this or that ‘breakthrough’which never sees the light of day. AIDS, this heaven-sent profits-booster for the drug companies, is not some mysterious disease thathas come from nowhere. It was almost certainly created in alaboratory. I have seen some evidence presented by Robert StreckerMD that AIDS is basically caused by the amalgamation of twoanimal diseases - bovine leukemia in cattle and visna virus whichaffects sheep.Dr Strecker says that, the genes of the AIDS-causing virus do notexist in primates or humans. But they do exist in these two viruses,known as retro-viruses, in cattle and sheep. During hearings of theChurch Committee in 1969 it was learned that the Department ofDefence had asked for ten million dollars to create new viruses todestroy the immune system. In 1972 the Bulletin of the WorldHealth Organisation (part of the UN) carried suggestions from agroup of virologists that a virus be made to destroy the T-cell andB-cell systems of human beings. The idea was, it appears, that ifthey could make a virus to cause cancers and leukemia, it wouldhelp them to find a cure for those diseases. Strecker’s research leadshim to believe that the bovine leukemia and visna virus were mixedin the laboratory to create the bovinevisna virus. This was thengrown in human tissue, which turned into a virus that affected thehuman body in a way that dismantled the immune system. We call itAIDS.The authorities denied this, and even denied the existence of thecattle-sheep virus combination known as the bovine-visna virus, butDr Strecker tracked down papers detailing this very thing. He says:"},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"307“(Bovine-visna virus) had the exact same shape as the AIDS virus;it had the same molecular weight; it had the exact same geneticstructure in a sense; it had the exact same Magnesium dependency,which is relatively unique in this class of agents. It had the exact samecapability of killing T-cells selectively and yet, in the cumulativeknowledge of the world’s AIDS experts, this virus didn’t exist. Nowthat’s a lie.“What we think happened was that... in 1972 we produced a groupof viruses that will cause cancer in the laboratories around the worldand then, in our opinion, these viruses were probably tested. We thinkthey were tested in large populations in Africa, which explains howyou get three hundred million Africans probably infected today Theepidemic in Africa would not have started from a single-pointinfection. In other words, the numbers infected are so great that therehad to be a mass inoculation at some point in the mid-1970s. What wethink really happened was a group of scientists went to Africa andactually tested these agents there.”It is also interesting that, according to Dr Strecker, the initialspread of AIDS in the United States tallies exactly with a USGovernment vaccine study on Hepatitis B which involved young,white male homosexuals between the ages of twenty and forty. AIDSappeared where the Hepatitis vaccine study had been - New York,San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago and St. Louis. If you believethat no one would ever do such a thing, that’s because you run yourlife with standards that are far higher than the misguided people whorun the world. When you think that many countries have testednuclear bombs without evacuating either their soldiers or the localpopulation, because they want to study the effects on the humanbody, it is clear how much respect some of these characters have forhuman life. Poisons and radiation have been released purposely intolocal populations around the world for studies on the effects. Germwarfare testing has been conducted in this way. One of the projectswhich have done this in the United States was called MK-ULTRAwhich I spoke of in an earlier chapter.. Robert Strecker says that inAlabama, they recruited black men in the 1930s for a long-term studyon the progression of syphilis, and when penicillin came along, theyprevented the men from being cured, because they considered thestudy more important. The same mentality, and worse, goes on in thescientific community today among the extremists. That Alabama"},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"308study, incidentally, was conducted by the US Public Health ServiceDepartment which today works out of Atlanta, Georgia under the titleof The Center for Disease Control, and it ‘leads’ the governmentbattle against AIDS. I feel that the cure for AIDS might already beknown.I don’t know if all Dr Strecker’s assumptions are correct, but hemakes some telling points and I feel sure that AIDS has its origin in alaboratory or with negative ETs. One of the themes running throughthe findings of the researchers into the New World Order is that thereis a secret plan to reduce the global population by genocide, and thatincludes attempts to use diseases like AIDS and germ warfaretechniques. As I say, these are strange people under the influence of avery misguided force. What is it that the Protocols say? They wouldundermine humanity in part by “the inoculation of diseases”.The idea of reducing the population through the spread of diseaseis believed to have originated from a meeting of scientists in 1957,who came to the conclusion that the soaring population, pollutionand the exploitation of the environment would destroy the planet’slife support systems by the year 2000. Eisenhower ordered a study tobe conducted into alternative ways of responding to this crisis.Alternative One was to use nuclear devices to blast holes in thestratosphere to allow heat and pollution to escape, and change thedestructive human culture into one ofenvironmental protection (thiswas rejected). Alternative Two was to construct underground cities,connected by tunnels, where selected representatives of the variouscultures would continue the human race. Alternative Three was forthe chosen few to move to new bases on the Moon and other planets.The Moon was code-named ‘Adam’ for this plan, and Mars was‘Eve’. All three alternatives include the release of deadly diseases,and AIDS is said to be one of them. I cannot confirm any of this, andI don’t present it as fact, but what is obvious is that we have not evenbegun to know the full story about AIDS. One body of opinionsuggests that the HIV virus, which is said to cause AIDS, is not theculprit, or not the only one, and I believe that the electromagneticpollution produced by the military and secret services is harming thehuman immune system.The cure for AIDS and other human diseases lies in the areastermed alternative medicine. I am particularly impressed withvibrational medicine and the use of sound to re-balance andreharmonise the mind, body and spirit. I said before that every"},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"309vibration has its own sound, shade of colour, symbol and number,and if you can use these to harmonise the body and the human energyfield, dis-ease is replaced by health. The sound which represents thevibration of tre-harmony for the Earth is the ‘OM’ sound and itscolour is white, the amalgamation of all colours. The ancients knewof this The symbol of the OM vibration is the three spirals whichtogether form a triangle. It can be found on countless ancient sites,stones and caves. This knowledge is now resurfacing in ourconsciousness, and it will revolutionise healing.Alternatives like acupuncture, homeopathy, rieki, radionics,aromatherapy, reflexology, and others reflect a far widerunderstanding of the human being. They seek to remove theimbalances on all levels and treat the cause, not the symptom.Preferably, they wish to identify potential trouble and re-balance theenergy fields before any physical discomfort is felt. Acupuncture,which is thousands of years older than the drug companies, usesneedles to balance out the energy flows through the chakras and thelines of energy known as meridians. Hands-on healing of the genuinekind is not ‘faith healing’; it is the transfer of energies from thehealer through their hands to the patient. A form of photographydeveloped by a Russian couple called Kirlian can photograph theenergy fields around the body. They found that when theyphotographed someone with an illness the energy fields were weak.When they photographed healers, the energies were particularly vividand bright. After a healing session, the patient’s energies werestronger and the healers had temporarily diminished. Everyone hasthe potential to heal to some level depending on what they havechosen to do in this life. In the next few years, millions are going torealise that they have come to the Earth to be healers, because that isgoing to be vital during the transition.The evolution of healing is another example of why the system hasto collapse if real change is to be realised. The growth in alternativehealing has been hastened by the breakdown of the disease-careservices like the National Health Service in Britain. That isconstantly short of funds because the system is unable to produce themoney from over-production to cope with the growth in human dis-ease caused by conspicuous consumption; and when a health serviceis dependent on drug-based treatments and expensive surgery, it willnever have enough money for all it needs to do. The demise of theeconomic system is encouraging people to look for alternatives like"},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"310barter, and it is the same with healing.The disease services are falling apart and people are turning toalternatives far more rapidly than they would otherwise have done.The changes in conscious ness will speed this process every year,until we see a fusion between the knowledge of the physical level asexpressed by today’s doctors, and the understanding of the higherlevels which alternative methods possess. I do not see this fusion as a50-50 balance. Nothing like. The alternative methods will becomethe overwhelming foundations of health care, and other even moreeffective methods will be developed as higher knowledge becomesavailable to us and we can control the aging process and removegenetic disease by re-programming the DNA genetic coding. The cut‘em and drug ‘em days are almost over.We will see that the physical body is a far more fantastic creationthan science has yet understood and the basis of all health and illness isthought. Our etheric energy fields organise the physical body as I havealready said and it encodes every single cell with a memory of what itis and what it has to do. A cell is a classic example of the universalprincipal of as above, so below. Each one is, in its energy system andmemory, a smaller version of the whole body. Our thoughts areconstantly affecting this process positively and negatively. Everythingthat happens to us which affects our thoughts is affecting the DNAgenetic coding which we pass on to our children, or, at be moreaccurate, the physical bodies we create for the consciousness of ourchildren. We can get genetic illness because of an emotional trauma orphysical accident which someone experienced in the same genetic linethousands of years ago. The affect of the emotions on the ethericorganisation is passed through to the DNA and on down the line untilthe DNA is ‘wiped’ clean of that inherited genetic imbalance. This canbe done very quickly and simply in a few minutes once you know how,and long-standing illnesses disappear after such treatment. It does notinvolve a single drug or any surgery whatsoever. As this gainsacceptance you will not be able to give away shares in the drugcompanies and conventional medicine. We are obviously very muchaffected by the genetic history of the ancestral line of our geneticspacesuits and people are dying every day, every minute of every daycome to that, for the want of a simple treatment that can remove thegenetic inheritances that all bodies carry. What we do and what weexperience emotionally and physically in this life is passed on to ourchildren. Once this DNA cleansing is widely accepted, expectant"},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"311mothers and would-be fathers will go through this process to ensurethat they are passing on only positive genetic codes to their children.The emotional state of the mother during pregnancy has a very bigeffect on the children, because the baby in the womb is linked to themother’s blood supply and its growing form is affected genetically bywhat she is experiencing emotionally. Healers in this field ofVibrational Medicine and genetic cleansing are years ahead ofmedical science as we have come to know it. Watch the drugcompanies try to marginalise and outlaw alternatives to their empiresof greed as the years progress. They are already doing so, and weshould respond to this in the usual way - by ignoring them and anylaws that might arise from their lobbying.The expansion of healing and healers cannot happen too fast. Somediseases will disappear with the rising consciousness, while new oneswill develop some of them from the effect of the quickeningvibrations on those who choose to close their minds to change. Thevibratory disharmony between those people and the consciousness ofthe planet will have many consequences for mental, emotional, andphysical well-being. The more people who have activated theirhealing gifts, the better it will be for everyone. This need will becompounded by the consequences of administering drugs like sweets.I wrote in It Doesn’t Have To Be Like This of the danger from‘Superbugs’. These are viruses that have developed immunity todrugs like antibiotics which have been prescribed for almost anythingthat moves. We are now seeing these Superbugs and I feel that somediseases we thought had gone forever will start to return. Superbugs,incidentally, have implications for food production. Drug4nfestedfarming methods are giving insects immunity to the poisons sprayedon the crops.On the other side of the transition our knowledge will be such thatwe will live on this physical level for hundreds of years if we wish,just as we did in Atlantis. We will hear stories of a time on Earthwhen people said that only the physical world existed; we will betold of a civilisation so primitive that they ravaged the planet forfuels, cut open their bodies, and used potions that caused as muchillness as they cured. We will smile at the story tellers. We will shakeour heads. And we will find itso hard to believe."},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"31218Bricks in the WallLET me offer you a definition of the word education as expressed inschools and universities across the world: To teach, instruct, andimbue with a doctrine, idea or opinion.The Oxford English Dictionary would not agree because that it isthe definition it gives for the word ‘indoctrinate’. But, to me, that is aperfect description of humanity’s version of education. Our childrenare not educated. They are indoctrinated - ‘imbued with a doctrine,idea, or opinion.This is essential to the process of conditioning that we are subjec-ted to throughout our lives.

What better way to condition your populationthan to have control of what young people are taught through theirformative years? And from what we have seen of the system in all itsglory, do you think this control is going to be used for the good of thechildren or the good of the system? Education, at least in its Westernmode, is there to turn out system fodder.It fills young and potentially creative minds with streams of boring,irrelevant and often inaccurate information; with complexmathematical equations most people will never use; and with a viewof history that puts the State in the best possible light.

Thecampaigner, Michael Roll, makes this point in his booklet TheSuppression of Knowledge. He was referring here to those in highplaces within the system, but the principles apply to everyone andeverything, be it religion, science, or economics:“If a baby from birth is told by loving parents that 2 + 2 = 3; andlater at Sunday school, kindergarten, preparatory school, publicschool, and university this young mind is again told by apparentlyclever and often highly respected teachers that 2 + 2 = 3; and if thissame teaching comes through the mass media, backed by the weightof law, is it any wonder that many people, often in very responsiblepositions, seriously believe that 2 + 2 = 3 ?”The system is geared to the setting and passing of examinations.This immediately creates ‘successes’ (those with the ability to absorb"},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"314and remember m6stly irrelevant and inaccurate information) and‘failures’ (those who do not have that ability or are too bored to useit). The ‘successes’ go on to university to absorb yet more irrelevantand inaccurate information and the ‘failures’ go off to look forjobsthat are more likely to be given to the ‘successes.’ What a way to startyour life, be you a success or failure.I was a failure under that definition. I was bored stiff at school. Icould not see how most of the tidal wave of information I was beingforced to listen to day after day could have any relevance to myfuture life. I also had the underlying feeling that most of what I wasbeing told was baloney anyway. I was talked at by the teachers andrarely consulted for my view or asked to express creativity. I neverpassed an exam and I left school at the first opportunity to become aprofessional soccer player. All my education in its true sense hashappened since. I enjoyed school for the sport and my friends. I likedmost of the teachers, too, because they were very nice people. But thelessons and examinations were something I had to endure in order toplay soccer and be with my mates.I can see why the system loves examinations. They are an excellentway of making children and young people absorb the system’s view.There is little margin for personal opinion. If you are going to passyou must tell the status quo what it wants to hear. Who sets thequestions in exams? The status quo. Who decides what the answersmust be if you are going to pass? The status quo. Whatever is theconventional wisdom of the day provides the criteria under whichyou pass or fail. A few centuries ago you would have failed yourexam if you had said the Earth was round!Like all aspects of the system, education is in desperate trouble. (tsrole is to produce robots to fill the jobs the system requires them todo and to condition out of young people any idea of rebellion againstthe status quo. The system does not evolve to encompass the giftsand creativity of people; people have to be conditioned and preparedto fit the system. People blindly accept that while take-make-and-throwaway could employ the robots. Most accepted that you went toschool to be prepared for work and then you worked in a trade untilyou retired or died. But now that is no longer happening in the sameway. Millions of young people can see no prospect of ajob at the endof the line. Even the ‘successes’, the university graduates, arestruggling to find employment. A feeling of ‘what’s the point?’ isgrowing. Truancy is mostly caused through boredom and a lack of"},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"315self worth and involvement at school. Everyone, but everyone, haslatent creativity and gifts they have come to offer the world. Humaneducation is only seriously interested in the gifts that fit the systemand that leaves out a terrific number of alienated people.Within this perversion of the word education are a number ofenlightened teachers and, to a lesser extent in my experience,university lecturers. They do the best they can to lessen theindoctrination. There are schools which try to tap the full potential oftheir students. But, like the doctors, nurses, politicians, journalists,economists and scientists who are opening their consciousness togreater understanding, teachers and lecturers are subject to severelimitations of action by the structure and control they have to endure.As the demise of take-make-and-throwaway quickens we are hearinggovernment ministers talking of a ‘return to basics’ in all things. Thisis their way of finding some illusion of security in a mythical 1950sutopia in which everyone had their place and everyone knew what itwas. This back to basics policy when applied to education, puts anemphasis on ‘talking at’ teaching, an expansion of tests and examsand, to quote one Education Secretary, a return to teaching a fear ofGod. Give me strength.I see a very different approach surfacing as consciousness expandsits understanding of life. Like everything I have discussed in thisbook, the transition period for education will be one of opposites.The status quo and those who support it will try to hold back changeby returning to ‘basics’ as they call them. They will wish to makeeducation even more rigid and impose more dogma as a reaction tochanges that will eventually sweep it away. Against that will be agrowing demand from awakening people for education to replaceindoctrination.There are things we all need to learn in our early years, like how tocount, write, and communicate. We also require a summary of theideas that claim to explain what is happening around us. But, likehistory, these need to be presented as ideas, opinions and views, notfacts, unless they can she shown to be so. You only have to readgovernment papers which are released thirty years after events to seehow the state re-writes history every day - look at the information inthis book! Secret Illuminati documents which have come to light saythat they have rewritten some history, perhaps to suit its own ends. Topresent all but the outlines of history as fact is to mislead. Children inthe United States were brought up to believe the Indians were"},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"316backward savages. When those children grew up, many treated theIndians appallingly from that indoctrinated perspective. Britishchildren are taught by law in the schools that the Christian story ishistorical fact, not a story that Christians choose to believe. I wasnever told at school about Constantine’s Council of Nicaea, theJesus-style saviour figures of the pre-Christians, or the ‘crusade’against the Cathars. Nor are my children. Every Christmas, pupils inprimary schools perform nativity plays. That’s fine if the story of theNativity is portrayed as art, the acting-out of a Christian belief. But itisn’t. It’s mostly presented to the children as history.I am looking forward to an education which teaches written andverbal communication, the mathematics we will need in oureveryday lives, and the information that will help young people tohave a wide understanding of the world. They need to be givenaccess to all views and to be encouraged to have their own opinions.In the teaching of religion, for example, the course would includeexplanations of what all religions believe and why. There would beno imposition of one Christian, Muslim, or Jewish dogma.Explanations of karma, reincarnation, and Earth energies would beadded to the curriculum along with the principles of astrology andalternative forms of healing to allow children and students theopportunity to have access to all views, not only those which thestatus quo wants us to believe.Education of the future will encourage self-reliance. The basicskills people need to live without dependence on the system will beat the heart of this. How to grow food, cook, build a house, repair andmaintain a home and its contents and the other skills necessary to beindependent. This gives young people choices throughout their lives.The education system of today is teaching more and more about lessand less. It is producing people who are dependent on earning moneyfrom one specialised skill to pay for all the other things they need.This is the opposite of independence. And look at the consequenceswhen that skill is no longer required by take-make-and- throwaway.But making people dependent serves the system magnificently.The main motivation of the new education will be to identify andencourage the gifts the student has brought into incarnation. Thestudents themselves will decide this. Ask young people what theymost enjoy and you will invariably be looking at their naturalpotential. We reveal our gifts in our enthusiasms and interests. Manyyoung people who are less than ‘successful’ at school will be doing"},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"317some marvellous things in their spare time when they are in controlof what they can and cannot do. I have known people who wereregarded as failures at maths at school but who can work out the oddsand pay-outs for a horse race at lightning speed. This is possiblebecause the maths involved - in this case when applied to horseracing - has become part of their enthusiasm. You may not agree withhorse racing or betting, but that’s another subject. The point I ammaking is that, if you encourage people’s enthusiasms and use thoseas a basis for teaching other skills, you are going to be very muchmore successful than if you only talk at them from the front of theclass or tell them to read text books.The new education will not concentrate on the skills demanded bythroughput. There will be greater opportunities to develop gifts in thearts, crafts and sport. With everyone’s gifts encouraged, there will beno ‘failures’. Youngsters will not be leaving school thinking theyhave failed because the examination results say so. Once the base anddiversity of knowledge has been taught, the opportunities will bethere to specialise and develop to a level of excellence whatever thestudent has decided he or she wishes to do. But this will happen withthe wide range of skills and understanding underpinning thatspecialisation and the choices they offer, always available.Respect and love for the Earth and all life will be encouragedthroughout the new education. From an early age, children will spendtime, as part of their curriculum, working in the community with oldpeople, the infirm and those in need for whatever reason. Loving andcaring for each other will be the guiding principles of education.Professional teachers won’t be the only vehicles for educating theyoung. In every community there are thousands of people with skillsand knowledge which would benefit students. But, instead of usingthat wealth of knowledge, the system relies on teachers and lecturersalone to give insights into subjects for which they often have nopractical experience. There needs to be a better balance between theteachers’ classroom skills and the practical experience of others inthe community.It is time for the teaching profession to rebel and refuse to servethis system of indoctrination any longer. They are just being used bythose in control to feed the children in their care the information thesystem wants them to hear and believe. Come on teachers andteachers’ unions. Refuse to be used as system fodder programmed toturn out more fodder to replace you. Stop cooperating, Say No. The"},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"318same applies to parents. Insist on real education. Stop cooperatingwith the programming of your children. The circle must be broken.During the transition period, I expect more people to take theirchildren out of the state system. They will either teach them at homeor get together in groups to form their own schools. These will not begiant comprehensives. They will be much smaller and more personal.A typical one could be composed of just a few families gettingtogether. Far less of a student’s day will be spent sitting and beingtalked at; far more in doing and talking themselves. The move awayfrom formal state education will increase through this decade andacross the millennium. Economic collapse will add further to thedemise of the present education system. Further in the future, thewhole concept of education will be unrecognisable when comparedto what we have today or even to the new approach to learning whichI have been promoting.We need to appreciate that going through the state educationindoctrination machine and coming out with examination passes andletters after your name does not, in itself, make you intelligent, wiseor inspired. It can actually suppress all three. While I was writingthis chapter I saw a ‘highly-qualified’ scientist giving a televisionlecture about the new frontiers of science. At the end he posed anumber of questions which he said science will need to answerabout the mysteries of life. People without his paper qualificationshave been answering those questions since before he was born, butthe system has not listened. In the next twenty years, it will beshown, even to the satisfaction of mainstream thinking, that thethemes in this book and others about life and Creation are correct.The media could have printed these answers years ago, but theyignored them because I and people like me do not have letters afterour name or have our explanations pored over in scientific journals.Nor are we supporters of the status quo. The education system oftoday doesn’t just indoctrinate the population during their time atschool and university. It decides throughout our lives who weshould listen to and who we should not, especially when science isinvolved.Yet, if you can access higher levels of consciousness, you can bringinto this world understandings and knowledge that are light yearsahead of human science, the bulk of which is only interested in thephysical world.

We will tellthe children what we know, or think we know, and they will tell uswhat they know. Encouraging them to connect with their highestpotential will be the most important gift we can give to them and theworld.

In this chapter Iam looking at some of the ways ‘they’ exploit the spirit and the mindsof the human race, how we can stop it happening and how ‘they’ arelikely to react to the challenge of the changing consciousness thatthreatens their ambitions so fundamentally. It is important to knowwhat is going on because the mind controllers in all their forms willbe trying even harder today to prevent the sort of changes I haveoutlined in the second halfofthe book.Religions like Christianity, Islam, Judaism and so many others haveonly survived this long by fear, indoctrination and imposition.Without these, they would have been long gone. In their extremeforms they amount to nothing less than spiritual fascism. Their fear,guilt and prejudice have been indoctrinated through the generationsover thousands of years and they have made a fundamentalcontribution to the division and pain on the Earth today. How ironicthat those who proclaim the Jewish religion and condemn Islamcould well have experienced Islamic lives in the past and vice-versa.It’s the same with Protestants and Catholics, those two expressions ofthe Christian creed which have often been in conflict. Whenever I seeIan Paisley, the vehement Protestant spokesman in Northern Ireland,a voice in my mind says, ‘He was apope!’.While the major religions speak of a world of spirit, they have beencreated by and motivated by the misunderstandings in the world ofmatter under the guidance of highly negative and imbalanced aspects"},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"321of the Luciferic consciousness working on the minds of thoseinvolved - not all of them, but enough. The religions have soughtmaterial and political power and that has been their driving force.They have wished to control and deny free expression. TheInquisitions, the torture and the mass murder of non-believers areevidence of that. Any creed which has to indoctrinate, frighten andimpose itself through violence and genocide has no respect forhuman life and freedom of thought and expression, nor for the veryvalues it is supposed to proclaim. If they are so confident that whatthey say is true and credible, why do they feel the need to impose itand suppress alternative explanations? The answer to that is that,without imposition, it would not be here today.We now have endless factions of Christianity, Mormons,Methodists, Baptists and more far right mind-controlling sectsspringing up to take advantage of humanity’s spiritual emptiness andlack of meaning, particularly among the young. ‘Give us your money,do as we say and we’ll give you all the answers because we are therepresentatives of God. If you don’t do what we say, you will berejected by Jesus and go into the fires of hell.’ That sums up the basicmessage of so many sick and misguided groups which prey on theminds of those seeking meaning in this crazy world. Exploitation ofthe spirit is a growth industry.For nearly two thousand years Christianity had a free hand to forceits creed upon the population of; particularly, the Western world.British people were forced to go to church by law and even todayChristianity is given free air time quite outrageously day after day bythe BBC and others to broadcast its propaganda. The Christian viewis taught, again by law, in the schools. The Church of England is partof the institution of State. Prime Ministers are involved in theselection of bishops and the monarch is crowned as ‘Defender of theFaith’. Most people have forgotten that the church became part of thestate in the first place only because Henry VIII wanted a divorce andthe Pope refused to allow it. As we have seen, Henry’s decision toignore the Pope and the determination of his daughter, Elizabeth I, tobecome supreme head of a Protestant Church of England led toChurch and State becoming linked at all levels. To this day, bishopsare given automatic places in the House of Lords and most of theclergy are often reluctant or frightened to speak out strongly againstgovernments who abuse the values for which the Church claims tostand. There are exceptions to this, but the general rule remains."},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"322Christianity and other religions have instigated, supported or watchedwithout challenge, some of the most horrendous atrocities againsthumanity and the Earth. Roman Catholicism, that most arrogant ofdictatorships controlled by the Brotherhood and the notorious P2Lodge of Freemasons. still tries to force people to behave in ways itdeems acceptable.Yet, despite all its imposition, privileges and advantages, theChristian Church is crumbling before our eyes. Attendances continueto fall and churches to close because the money is no longer there topay the bills. The Church of England has been financed mostly fromits land holdings and inherited wealth. The largest part of this land,and therefore the Church’s wealth, came into its possession throughforce of various kinds, violent or psychological. In some cases,landowners who went off to fight for God (Christian power andinfluence) in the Crusades were persuaded by the Church to sign overall their land and property in the event of their death. Giving all thatto the Church would ensure a place in Heaven. Purely by coincidenceit would also ensure that the Church became richer. They couldalways come up with a biblical passage to support them:“And everyone that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, orfather or mother, or wife or children, or lands for my name’s sake,shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life.”But falling attendances and ill-fated property speculation from thelate 1980s have dramatically reduced the wealth of the Church ofEngland, and others are also, or will soon be, in similar trouble.Around three-quarters of a billion pounds have been wiped off theChurch of England’s assets and that is only what they have publiclyadmitted to. Parish churches have been told they will now have toraise more of their money for themselves because the central fundcannot afford to continue with donations at the level they have beenin the past. Even the ability of the Church to pay pensions to itsclergy has been questioned.Alongside this blow to its finances has come the public questioningof its dogma. I have said before that part of the plan for thetransformation has been for some of the volunteers to incarnate withthe task of becoming part of the bastions of mind-control, like theChurch, the media, the monarchy, and science. They would notremember this yet but they are being activated at the right time to"},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"323undermine these organisations from within. A wonderful example ofthis, I believe, is the former Bishop of Durham, David Jenkins. Hehas attracted fierce criticism from fanatics for questioning theChristian version of the Virgin Birth, much of the Christmas story,the Second Coming and the existence of a place called Hell to whichsinners are supposed to be condemned for all eternity. Like mostpeople who stand up and speak out with courage he was onlyarticulating what others believe but are too frightened say. It speaksmuch for the feeble foundations of Christianity that those who attackthe Bishop say he is questioning the whole basis on which theChristian religion stands or falls. If a creed depends on events thatsupposedly happened two thousand years ago, as reported in a bookwritten by who knows who and who knows when, in who knowswhat circumstances, it doesn’t say much for the creed, does it? Butthe Bishop has had the courage to keep on speaking out and, slowly,others within the Protestant and Catholic churches are beginning todo the same. The realisation is beginning to dawn that ancient textshave to be read symbolically, not literally, most of the time, and thatyou cannot use them as an infallible record of truth. Such peoplehave a long way to move before they encompass the sort of themesincluded in this book but they are already questioning the dogmaticview of the Church. We will see more people breaking ranks andsaying what they have long believed - that the dogma of the Christiancreed is simply not credible. You only have to read some Christianliterature to realise that:“If you ignore him (Jesus) and reject him now, at the Day OfJudgment when we must all stand before him he will ignore and rejectyou. ‘I do not know you, depart from me’.” (This is the ‘loving’ Jesusand the Prince of Peace?)“...after death there is no more opportunity to turn to Christ. It willbe too late.” (This is clearly bad news for the babies who die after afew minutes or the little children who have not had the opportunity toknow what Jesus is demanding of them. And what about the childrenin parts of the world who do not even know of Jesus?)“The good news of the Gospel is that Jesus, the perfrct substitute,made the ultimate once and for all payment on our behalf It cost HimHis lift. As a result God gives the free gift ofsalvation to those whobelieve in His Son.”"},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"324(The publication from which this quote is taken included a chapterattacking alternative thought called ‘The Fine Art Of BaloneyDetection’!).Throughout the Christian Church there are many thousands ofpeople, like the Quakers, who have been attracted by the laudablevalues attributed to Jesus in the Gospels. They have suffered thedogma but lived the values. They have used the Church to work forthe good of the community. Indeed, there are some magnificenthuman beings working within Christianity and other religions. Theseare people who would have found other ways to express theirdecency if the Church had never existed. They are prisoners of thedogma within the Church structure but not within their ownconsciousness. When that structure is no more, and that time is notfar away, these Church people will be freed to live and promote thevalues of caring, sharing, love and tolerance without being forced toinsist that everything in the Bible is true and the word of God. Suchvalues have been devalued by the dogma which anyone with a mindthey can genuinely call their own knows to be invention and not eveninspired invention at that.The rising frequencies will be affecting open minded, value4ed,Church people in the same way that they are awakening others. Aswe have seen with the Bishop of Durham, the awakening to their rolein this life will be so powerful that they will not be able to stopthemselves from speaking out, no matter what the short-termconsequences for them might be. Tensions will grow between thisawakening consciousness within the Church and the closed mindswho will seek security in the face of these changes by the promotionof dogma in its most extreme forms. The demise of the economicsystem will bring the political right to the surface and the religiousright will rise in the wake of the Church’s collapse. Both will fail asthe transition proceeds, but they could cause considerable pain anddisruption in the short term. There are likely to be witch-hunts by theextremists against those within the religions who disagree with them.I see in all the religions the rejection of dogma by sensible, open-minded Muslims, Jews, Christians and others in the light of thechanging consciousness.

There will beattempts to portray the upheavals of the transition, including theweather and geological events, as God’s reprisals against a humanrace which does not behave as he says, (i.e. what the religiousdogmatists say). This will succeed with a few people and there willbe a temporary turning to these religions by those who fear what ishappening but don’t wish to take responsibility for their ownthoughts and actions. I believe that the Brotherhood and the scientistsof the underground bases, may use their Walt Disney technology toproject illusions of great religious miracles to suggest that the SecondComing is upon us and that people must repent (for repent, read ‘doas they say’).The Brotherhood will be at the same time be using the Church anddestroying it when the moment arrives to introduce its own“Messiah” or “World king”, whatever form that is supposed to take.Having manipulated the Vatican for its own ends, it will bring downthe Roman Catholic Church. It is vital that people do not buy theirludicious, but sinister, alternative:“We shall not overtly lay a finger on existing churches, but we shallfight against them by criticism calculated to produce schism... onlyyears divide us from the moment of the complete wrecking of theChristian religion. As for the other religions, we will have still lessdifficulty in dealing with them.” (Illuminati Protocol 17).Religion is under challenge on two fronts, the Brotherhood and thechanging consciousness, and the way we react to its devise is goingto decide which one will hold sway in the collective human mind.The greatest potential for trouble is from those countries wherereligious fascist regimes are already in control. To the people of suchcountries I would offer again these words: ‘100,000 Englishmencannot control 300 million Indians if those Indians will notcooperate’. Sadly, after a lifetime, often many lifetimes, of severeindoctrination, many of those in countries controlled by the religiousright have layers of conditioning to remove before they willchallenge that control in large enough numbers.

Itsreaction to this has been painfully predictable. It is turning to theweapons it always uses in times of trouble - fear andmisrepresentation. Nothing encapsulates this approach and what weare likely to see from the dogma-supporters in the near future betterthan a book called New Age versus the Gospel: Christianity’sGreatest Challenge. It was put through my letter box by a localChristian offering to ‘save’ me from my misguided ways. He did thiswith the best of intentions I am sure but all the book achieved was toconfirm to me (a) the pathetic nature of dogmatic Christianity and (b)the way in which that dogma reacts to alternative thought. This issome of the blurb on the book cover:“Suddenly it is chic to be ‘spiritual’.” (Implication: you can onlybe spiritual if you are a Christian).“But the roots of today’s ‘Spirituality’ are in Paganism, and notChristianity.” (A breathtaking statement when Christianity isrecycled Paganism!)“...(The New Age).. a heady mix of Hinduism, Buddhism, and thehard core occult represents the greatest threat to Christianity in thehistory of the faith.” (The term ‘hard core occult’ is designed tofrighten people. Occult is another word, like Paganism, thatChristianity has assassinated. Originally it meant ‘hidden’. Toinvestigate occult mysteries is to say you are investigating hiddenmysteries. The word occult has been changed to imply devil worship.No single body has promoted the cause of extreme negativity morethan Christianity through the centuries, except the Brotherhood. Andthe greatest threat to Christianity is, and has always been, itself.)“Christians need to know where New Age is coming from and howto counter its claims.” (misrepresent them.)“New Age Versus the Gospel analyses the menace, comes to gripswith the Gospel and points to the Powerfor revival.” (The rise ofevangelical dogmatists to condemn awakening peoples as evilfollowers of the Devil and to condemn other members of their owncreed who disagree with them as not real Christians).I have already been rebuked ‘in the name of the Lord’ by Christianevangelists and been dubbed ‘the anti-Christ’ and it was no surprisethat a whole chapter was devoted to me in that book. I had to read theaccount about me a couple of times to confirm I wasn’t dreaming. Itwas hysterical. The writer said that I had claimed on a television"},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"327programme to be a ‘New Age priest’. I am more likely to call myselfNellie The Elephant than that. As you will see, I have greatreservations about some areas of what is termed New Age, althoughnot for the reasons expressed in that book. What is more, the wholeidea of priests is abhorrent to me. Stand by for more of such insultsto the intelligence as the Christian dogmatists cling on to theirsinking ship and thrash out at all who are heading for the lifeboats.The foreword to the book was written by a cleric from All SoulsChurch, Langham Place, London. This is opposite the headquartersof BBC Radio and it is from All Souls that much free Christianpropaganda is broadcast to the nation by the ‘independent’ BBC.The author of the foreword has a real problem with the idea that allis One and all is God. Christianity is obsessed with portraying Godas an outside force which is not part of us. Humans cannot findanswers from within, the book informs us, we have to be ‘rescued’and that can only happen if we ‘find’ Jesus. Only by accepting thatJesus had to suffer horribly on the cross, in order for his father toagree to forgive the sins of the rest of us, can we be ‘saved’,apparently.He says that ‘from beginning to end, the New Age Movementexpresses a preoccupation, even an infatuation, with self. It puts selfin the place of God and even declares that we ARE God.”Dogmatic Christianity is based on division and lack of self-worth -a division between different parts of Creation and the belief that weare born sinners. Love of self is seen as arrogant, selfish andoffensive to God. In fact, it is the lack of self love and, through that,love for others which is at the heart of humanity’s malaise. We cannotlove, forgive and respect others until we can love, forgive and respectourselves. This link between love for self and love for others ishighlighted in my book Heal The World. People who are aggressivein their behaviour towards others are people who hate themselves.Their hatred of self is projected outwards in an apparent hatred of theworld. Yet, I was banned from speaking at the Central Hall inWestminster, London, because I am saying love yourself; love theworld.I had wanted to hire the hall for a talk. I rang them and learned thatthe date I wanted was available. All was going well. Then, after thedetails had been agreed, the lady asked for my name. When I told her,there was a silence. After a few seconds she recovered her voice buther attitude had changed. The hall was run by the Methodist Church,"},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"328she told me. I would have to write in and outline what I would besaying before permission to hire the hall would be granted. So muchfor freedom of speech, I thought. I wrote to them but they asked formore details. I wrote again to inform them that, in part, I would besaying that we need to love, forgive and respect ourselves if we aredo the same for others. I was not surprised that the Methodist trusteesof the Central Hall replied that I would not be allowed to speak there.But I was rather taken aback by the reason they gave for this ban.Part of their letter said:“....The doctrines of the evangelical faith which Methodism hasheld from the beginning and still holds, are based upon the Divinerevelation recorded in the Holy Scriptures. The Methodist Churchacknowledges this revelation as the supreme rule of faith andpractice..”In other words, I take it, they believe that the Bible, despite all itscontradictions, incitements to violence, and (according to research inthe 19th Century) 36,191 translation errors in the King James versionalone, is one hundred per cent accurate and infallible. The lettercontinued:“Central to the evangelical Christian doctrine is the belief that tolove God is the first commandment, and that implicit trust in Him isthe path to salvation. It is our feeling that the promotion of a world-view which is based on ‘self-love’ would be contrary to the ChristianGospel which Methodism seeks to expound.”What have we come to? Someone is barred from speaking because aview which involves loving, respecting and forgiving yourself andothers is ‘contrary to the Christian Gospel...’. Well, if that is the case,there is something seriously wrong with the Gospels or theinterpretation of them. No wonder the Church is dying on its feetwhen people hear this proclaimed from the pulpits; nor is itsurprising that Christianity has sought and fought to crush otherviews that threaten to expose its gigantic confidence trick on theminds of humanity. In the face of the new consciousness, thiscenturies-old prison of the mind has no chance of surviving, nomatter how it presents the beliefs of those who are putting a differentview. In his criticism of the New Age, the cleric from All Souls gives"},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":"329us an excellent insight into the misunderstandings and desperation ofChristianity. He says in his introduction:“To New Agers ‘transformation’ has nothing to do with people’smorality or behaviour. It refrrs rather to the transformation of theirconsciousness, the discovery and development of their ownpotential.”He says that as a criticism? And what will a transformation ofconsciousness do if not change the way people think and behave?Christianity lives in a dream world in which one generationindoctrinates the next. It speaks of Divine Will and revelation when,in reality, its dogma was decided by a Roman Emperor, sundrybishops and misguided popes who sought economic and politicalpower above spiritual insight. Its beliefs and ceremonies have theirorigin in the Pagan beliefs they so despise. Nothing will be affectedmore by the transformation, all over the planet, than Christianity andits like. Open-minded true scientists are going to be inspired toconfirm that all consciousness is eternal, that Creation is made up offrequencies and that everything is the same energy in different statesof being. All is One. This and other discoveries and exposures willhasten the end of Christianity. We will see real science (not thesystem-serving variety) and spirituality (not religion) speaking thesame language. In fact, they already are.The new spirituality will have no rules and regulations. It willrespect the right of all to believe what they think is correct. Its onlychallenge will be to those who wish to force others, through subtleand less subtle means, to believe what they want them to believe. Myproblem with Christianity and other dogmatic religions is not withtheir right to believe what they wish, but with the way they have triedto impose their beliefs through fear, violence and support from theState. Had that not been the case, this chapter would not have neededto be written, for the Christian religion would no longer be with us.During the transformation, people will be guided together,naturally, as higher selves reconnect powerfully with our physicalpersonalities. It will be a free spirituality in which we can link withthe Source and the higher levels when we are alone at home, with afew friends, or in vast groups. The choice will be ours and one willbe no more valid than the other. With so many churches built onenergy points, I believe many could be used by spiritual groups asChristianity continues to fold and the churches close. They could be"},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"330used for energy-channelling and healing, rather than for theobsession with events which took place two thousand years ago.They will be places of love and joy where the gift of life can becelebrated with others. They will not be places of fear and guiltwhich emphasise ‘sin’ at the expense of people loving themselves.With science and spirituality working as one, we will be visiting andinteracting with other loving civilisations in the Universe and movingacross frequencies. This will give a fantastic understanding of lifeand Creation compared with what we have now. Our spirituality willevolve rapidly as a result, if we are open to it.There are dangers on this road, however, even for those who acceptthe themes of this book. You can believe in reincarnation withoutserving others. You can speak of peace and love without reallymeaning it at the core of your being. It is easy for love and peace tobecome the spiritual equivalent of ‘have a nice day’. All that glittersis not gold and all that speaks of love and peace is not loving andpeaceful. I have had several experiences, some very extreme, whichhave shown me this. So much of what is termed ‘New Age’ is merelythe Old Age in disguise. It is, too often, the old thought patterns andreactions at work under a different cloak, that’s all.The New Age is a vast tapestry of people and beliefs and shouldnot be seen as a movement or entity which thinks and believes thesame. I refuse to call myself ‘New Age’ because, like tens of millionsof others, I am an aspect of consciousness awakening to my true selfand that does not require titles or all-encompassing ‘movements’. Itrequires me to follow my own intuition at all times. Within the NewAge field, there is substantial exploitation and there are many whocomplicate simple themes. The more complicated you can make itappear, the more people will be dependent on others to decide what isbest and to sell them endless paraphernalia - rebirthing tanks,counselling, karma sessions and goodness knows what else. The ideais to free people from spiritual dependency and dependency of allkinds - not to create a new dependency on a guru, teacher, channelleror piece of equipment. That is not to say that some of these New Ageservices are not helpful when enlightened people are involved, theycertainly are. But too much is irrelevant and emotionally-dangerousexploitation. It can hold back your awakening and, in areas likekarmic counselling, can, possibly, make you feel really bad aboutyourself if the counsellor tells you of unpleasant things he or sheclaims you were responsible for in past lives. It is the same with"},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":"331many channellers. Much channelled information is claptrap andneeds to be treated with great caution. There is a woman I met brieflywith Yeva who now sends me a stream of strange letters claiming themost outrageous things. She is quite obviously in a stateofconsiderable confusion and in need of some enlightened help yet,on her business cards, she describes herself as a past life and presentlife counsellor. Be careful.The Brotherhood have infiltrated New Age and UFO groups andnegative extra-terrestrials could have been using channellers forthousands of years. Remember, they know this consciousness shift isplanned and they want to stop it because they know the consequencesof it for them. What better way than to feed a load of trash throughchannellers and ‘gurus’ to those who are being affected by that shift?I read in one American New Age magazine some channelling,purporting to come from extra-terrestrials, that was calling for aworld government. I have reservations, too, about some of thecommunications which allegedly come from ‘Ascended Masters’.Whenever I hear that term, I feel really bad about it. I have had badvibes about some of the groups who have promoted this idea of‘Masters’, not least the ‘I am’ cult in the United States. The Masters,according to New Age belief; are part of something called the GreatWhite Brotherhood who are said to be guiding humanity and theEarth through this time of change. But are they? Someone is, forsure, but can it be the entities who are said to be Masters? I’m not yetconvinced, you know. It could be that it is the hierarchal tone ofAscended Masters that makes me feel less than positive about it andmaybe the blind worship of these entities is not something they wishto happen. But, even if the ideas of Masters is correct, is everychannelled entity who claims to be from that consciousness streamreally telling the truth? The answer to the latter is definitely No,because negative ETs and the Luciferic consciousness use somechannellers tuning to the lower frequencies as a means to manipulate.Claiming to be from what is so widely accepted to be a positiveconsciousness stream like the Masters in an excellent way of doing it.I have no doubt that consciousness of a very high evolution is tryingto guide us, and so are streams of positive, loving ETs from otherUniversal civilizations, but we always have to be selective and waryabout who is on the other end of the line. Being spiritual is vital tothe transformation but being streetwise is equally so.Once again, the key is to follow our intuition, to listen to"},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":"332channelling while being very selective. It is what we feel is rightwithin our hearts that matters and that doesn’t need the name of someMaster of other to give it legitimacy. It has no name. It just is.A danger I see is that parts of the New Age could become nothingmore than another religion. The signs are already there. We have thegurus, the teachers, and the ‘living gods on Earth’. We see‘disciples’ giving over their responsibility to think and act to thesepeople in the same way that Christians do to the Bible and Jesus,and Muslims do to the Koran and Mohammed. I have met peoplewho have been diverted from thejourney to enlightenment bybecoming obsessed with Indian gurus. I have seen how they haveturned their homes into shrines to them. I am not saying that weshould not listen to the views of the guru figures, but no more sothan anyone else. What I challenge is the unquestioning worship ofthem. This is another expression of humanity’s collective desire topass on their responsibility to others for the way they think and act.This is precisely what the Brotherhood wants. All over the NewAge arena are cosy little niches where people can become trappedand cease to evolve their understanding. Some have a certain beliefabout karma and they stick with it, no matter what otherinformation comes to light; some channel the same non-physicalentities all their lives instead of expanding their consciousness toaccess higher and higher levels of information and knowledge;others mix only with those who agree with them and avoid thesometimes-unpleasant and painful necessity of taking theirknowledge to sceptical audiences who have as much right to hear itas everyone else.I understand why some people find a nice little spot on the path andpitch their tent. There have been many times in the past when I havewished to step off the road and take a rest for a while from thefrustration and aggravation of speaking to closed minds. But, if weare to speed the emergence of the new consciousness and freehumanity from the prison of indoctrination as smoothly as p05sible,we must continually work to expand our own understanding and topass on what we believe for others to accept or reject. No-one said itwould be easy and turning the New Age into another religion orgiving our responsibility to guru figures will hold back the spiritualrevolution. Respect and love are the foundations of the new thinking- the worship of others is not, I would suggest. That’s the old wayrecycled."},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"333But the positive contribution of what is termed the New Agemovement and which I term the Spiritual Renaissance far outweighsthe negative. I have met thousands of wonderful, loving, non-judgmental human beings who are doing a superb job in helpingpeople to awaken. No-one wants to stop the exploitation of the newconsciousness more than they do and, whenever I talk in these termsat meetings, the audience invariably shows its enthusiastic supportfor this view. What I am saying is, be careful. Just because someoneclaims to be a channeller, astrologer, karmic counsellor or healerdoes not mean that they are proficient in those skills. Not even thewell-known ones, necessarily. Look for those who are recommendedand respected by others in their field or by previous clients. Morethan anything, our own intuition should be our guide.I believe we could see three clearly identifiable groups during thetransition. There will be those who reject the rising frequencies andwho, as the years pass, will be easy to recognise. There will be thosewho move so far and stop when they find a comfortable niche. Andthere will be others, the few probably, who go on searching, seekingand challenging, no matter what the personal consequences in theshort term. The further you walk along the road the lonelier it canbecome, as others stop through weariness, material gain or fear. Withevery step, you are tuning to a higher wavelength which evolves yourunderstanding and behaviour. From the perspective of those whohave chosen to stop back down the road you may appear extreme andstrange. If you keep walking and seeking, you will be ridiculed andincreasingly condemned by the first group of padlocked minds. But Ifeel the second group, many of which will be within what is termedthe New Age Movement, will also be less than supportive of those onthe front of the snowplough who will be questioning many of thethemes on which some New Age niches depend. The road toenlightenment is never-ending. Just as we are leaving dogmaticreligion behind, so we will eventually do the same with manyelements of current New Age dogma.The third example of the exploitation of the spirit and the mind isthe Brotherhood with the behaviour-controlling technology I talkedabout in an earlier chapter. We are getting help with this from thehigher levels who are taking steps to block it as the transformationproceeds. The more who ask for this to be done, the better. Massforms of mind control can only affect us if we allow ourselves tode4ink from the frequency of love to which our heart chakras are"},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":"334tuned. If we think love and live love we can resist it.Another crucial way our minds are attacked is the programming bythe messages which are projected at us through the media and ourgeneral lives every day. We should not underestimate their power toexploit our minds and spirits. An Illuminati document called “SilentWeapons of Quiet Wars” was published in Beyond A Pale Horse. Thedocument was found in 1986 in an IBM copier bought at a secondhand sale. It was dated 1979. It encapsulates all that I have beensaying in this book:“Experience has proven that the simplest method of securing asilent weapon and gaining control of the public is to keep themundisciplined and ignorant of basic systems principles on the onehand, while keeping them confused, disorganised, and distracted withmatters of no real importance on the other hand.“This is achieved by:1. disengaging their minds; sabotaging their mental activities;providing a low-quality program of public education in mathematics,logic, systems design and economics, and discouraging technicalcreativity.2. engaging their emotions, increasing their self-indulgence andtheir indulgence in emotional and physical activities by:(a) unrelenting emotional affrontations and attacks (mental andemotional rape) by way of a constant barrage of sex, violence, andwars in the media - especially the TV and newspapers.(b) giving them what they desire - in excess - “junk food forthought” - and depriving them of what they really need.(c) Re-writing history and law and subjecting the public to thedeviant creation, thus being able to shift their thinking from personalneeds to highly fabricated outside priorities.These preclude their interest in and discovery of the silent weaponsof social automation technology. The general rule is that there isprofit in confusion; the more confusion, the more profit. Therefore thebest approach is to create problems and then offer the solutions.“In Summary:Media: Keep the adult public attention diverted away from the realsocial issues, and captivated by matters ofno real importance.Schools: Keep the young public ignorant of real mathematics, realeconomics, real law, and real history."},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"335Entertainment: Keep the public entertainment below a sixth gradelevel.Work: Keep the public busy, busy, busy, with no time to think; backon the farm with the other animals.”Recognise all that? Of course you do. It is the world we live in and itis exactly what the Illuminati have sought to create. If we are goingto repel this form of spiritual and mental exploitation we must start tothink for ourselves; to get involved and to get informed about what isreally going on; to make sure our children are informed and realisehow they are being manipulated; to get off our knees and start to useour minds to their full potential; to reject the pressure to accept thedrip, drip, drip of trivia designed to deaden our consciousness.The best way to challenge the negative is with joy, laughter, peace -and knowledge. The negative does not understand love and peace.And never underestimate your own potential and the power of yourown psyche. You own it. It belongs to no-one else, not a church,guru, ascended master, piece of technology or ET. You are connectedthrough your higher self to all Creation. Tap into that and no-one, butno-one, can exploit your spirit."},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"33620The Earth Needs Rebels“All that is necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to donothing” - Edmund Burke.A journey of a thousand miles begins with one step and atransformation of human understanding can begin with one thoughtand one rebel.Every improvement in the human condition has come fromsomeone pushing against the tide and speaking out, no matter whatthe consequences. That person is within all of us. Rebellion and thedesire for positive change is at the heart of the human spirit.But what is rebellion?The meaning of the word is often misunderstood. Many of thosewho once came to heckle and laugh when I have spoken in publichave been under the impression that they were rebels. Yet they aresystem servers doing exactly what they are programmed to do -undermining anyone prepared to challenge its control. Beers andjeers don’t make a rebellion. Others see rebels as those who wagewar against the State. I am sure those in Northern Ireland who dailykill and maim think they are rebels. But, again, they are merelypuppets of the Luciferic consciousness and the Brotherhood workingthrough both sides. The rebellion of which I speak does not involvearmed uprisings or violence of any kind. It is a rebellion againstindoctrination and mind control; a refusal to be programmed amoment longer by the ‘values’ imposed upon us by other generationsand by the super robots in politics, economics, science, religion andthe Brotherhood networks.Thinking for yourself and having the confidence and courage tolive what you believe - that’s rebellion.From this will come change in every aspect of life on Earth.

I have no desire or stomach for that. But I supportthe campaign of non-cooperation and peaceful resistance which isgathering across the world. I believe it will continue to grow and thatsome of its manifestations could be:* A boycott of all banks which create money out of nothing andcharge interest on it. I hope people will withdraw their money fromthese banks and even refuse to pay interest on their loans. The latterdecision needs to be well coordinated so that millions do it at thesame time.* Support for community banks and ethical banking which investin projects designed to benefit people and the planet.* A refusal to cooperate with and in schools, universities andgovernment departments in every country, until we have the free flowof information about what is really going on in secret and all theknowledge available.* Constant sit-ins, peaceful occupation and mass protests atgovernment headquarters in every country, particularly the keyplayers like the United States, Russia, Britain, Australia, Japan, theEuropean Community and the United Nations.* The peaceful disruption of all occasions of state in every countryuntil we are told the truth and the closing down, by mass sit-ins, ofroads and entrances to parliamentary buildings.* Mass peaceful resistance to projects that harm the environment.If they face such protests everywhere, the authorities will soon haveto re-think and listen.* The boycotting of all court proceedings that may arise from suchactions and mass sit-ins at the court buildings to disrupt them, also.* The bombardment of phone-in programmes and audienceparticipation programmes with questions and information about thesecret government and what people can do to stop its manipulation.* Protests and sit-ins at the headquarters of media organisationsuntil they refuse to be Brotherhood poodles and start to report thetruth to people.

A refusal to support any politician whois a member of any Brotherhood front organisation, such as theCouncil on Foreign Relations, the Trilateral Commission or, inLondon, connected to the Royal Institute of International Affairs.The three most important words here are peaceful, determined andconstant. Those who serve either knowingly or, more often,unknowingly, the forces who control us do not deserve our hatred.They need our love and we should protest with laughter and joy.They know not what they do and they are in prison as well. I alwaysfind it sad that some who protest against the activities of far rightgroups, do so with aggression and hatred in their hearts - the verysame emotions that motivate the far right. We need to protest withlove because that is the energy we wish to spread across the world.But our love must not be blind, it must be streetwise. We mustremember that in the world of the Brotherhood black is white andwhite is black. Remember this also: Silence is convenience. It is timeto think, to take responsibility, and to speak and act against the silent,secret, tyranny. The Brotherhood acknowledge the threat to theirambitions of individuals thinking for themselves and responding withaction:“(We wish to) discourage any kind of personal initiative whichmight hinder our affair. There is nothing more dangerous thanpersonal initiative; if it has genius behind it, such initiative can domore than can be done by millions of people among whom we havesown discord.” (Protocol 5).One individual can make a difference.

Through this book I havestrongly questioned the thought-patterns which control economics,politics, the media, science, religion and parts of the New Age. Somemay see this as judgmental. But we are all responsible for what hashappened since Atlantis and we have all done things we would rathernot have done. It is pointless trying to be holier than thou andjudging others from that lofty and misguided per-’ spective. Speakingout against negative thought-patterns is not being judgmental orunloving. After all, what is love? Is it loving to ignore what thesepatterns are doing to people and the planet? Is it loving to say that allis well and that there is no need to change what we do? Is it loving toavoid upsetting some people when, by speaking out, you may be ableto alert others to the dangers and the exploitation? I think not. Thereare times when love is calling a spade a shovel if that is what isneeded for positive change. One of the most important channelledmessages I have been given said:“True love does not always give the receiver what it would like toreceive, but it will always give that which is best for it.”Or, to add some humility to that, what we believe is best for it. Ihave met many people who think that protest and direct action, evenof the peaceful kind I am advocating, is unloving. I would not agreewith that and I feel that unless we begin a campaign ofnoncooperation with the system, we will allow the Brotherhood eliteto do some desperately unpleasant things in the wake of our inaction.There have been some negative themes running through this book,but they are not there to frighten, they are there to inform and alert.Have no fear.
