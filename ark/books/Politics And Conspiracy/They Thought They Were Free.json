But let itbe republished after ten years and the author is lucky if he gets off with nonotice at all and an unbloodied head. \"Things\" have changed in ten years, andthey have not changed as he promised (or appeared to promise) that they would.What he would give now if only he hadn't written this line or that one! Let himchange them, then, and bring the work up to date —the publisher is generous inthese small matters.In the always admirable hope of playing it safe, I have taken advantage of thepublisher's generosity and made all the changes in this edition that I was sureI was safe in making. They were two in number. I inserted the word \"late\" beforea reference to Jawaharlal Nehru and I substituted \"Stalin\" for \"Malenkov\" in anabstract reference to modern dictatorship. Otherwise the book stands as it wasfirst published, and if I must eat my words (except for those two), I must eatthem.Every thing changes. Every thing but one. Even the medieval Schoolmen admitted alimitation on God's omnipotence: He cannot change the past He can, in his owntime, disclose it, or let man stumble on it But he cannot change it. Thepre-Nazi and Nazi lives of my *ten Nazi friends—and of some millions of otherGermans like them—are and evervuForeword to the 1966 Printingwill be what they were ten years ago and twenty. To the extent that I read themright then, and wrote them right then, the account is long since complete. Norhas anything been revealed in the events of the past ten years (including thetrials in Germany compelled by Eichmann's in Israel) to alter the picture thatmy ten Nazi friends drew of themselves.When this book was first published it received some attention from the criticsbut none at all from the public. Nazism was finished in the bunker in Berlin andits death warrant signed on the bench at Nuremberg, It had gone out with a bang.Now there was nothing but rubble between the Americans and the Russians,standing face to face and armed to the teeth. Nobody wanted to hear about whatwas well gone and well forgotten—least of all to hear that the blood of millionsof people had bought nothing definitely durable. Hitler had attacked thecivilized world, and the civilized world, including by happiest accident theuncivilized Russians, had destroyed him. Basta.But the civilized world was not, even then, so well satisfied with what it haddone and with what, even then, it was doing, as to be able to stop doing what itwas doing and take a long thoughtful look at what it had done. Nazism was a drugon the market. This book—and not this one alone— became a collector's itemwithout collectors. But occasionally the publisher got an inquiry from a person(or a school or a college) who wanted it and couldn't get it. The inquiriesincreased to an interesting trickle. As \"things\" changed, on the whole for theworse, and the postwar world became the prewar world, and disarmament becamerearmament, there arose a modestly circumscribed sentiment that it might beprofitable to find out what it was that had made \"the Germans\" act as badly asthey did.VlllDreadful deeds like Auschwitz had been done before in human history, thoughnever on so hideously handsome a scale. But they had not been done before in anadvanced Christian society like—well, like ours. If we would keep such deedsfrom ever being done again, at least in advanced Christian societies, it mightbe worth digging a little deeper than the shallow grave so hurriedly dug atNuremberg. After the heat of the long moment had gone down, it was equallydifficult to cling to the pleasurable doctrine that the Germans were by naturethe enemies of mankind and to cling to the still more pleasurable doctrine thatit was possible for one (or two or three) madmen to make and unmake the historyof the world. These were the things that had met the bloodshot eye. But man hasmany saving graces, and not the least of them is his impulse to sober up betweenbrawls.Four wonderful facts of life contributed to the sobriety. First, the Jews ofGermany (and of Poland, and of where all else) were dead, and some humanisticmen in America and elsewhere had supposed at one time that it was necessary togo to war with Germany to \"save the Jews/' That, as it turned out, had not beenthe way (however gratifying its taking may have been to the humanisticimpulses). Second, the destruction of Hitler had involved the prior destructionof a whole nation to a degree that was possible to the technology of total warin which battlefields are only incidental areas of operation; and the nationwhich had been destroyed and revived (by those who had just destroyed it) wasnow the industrial and military titan of Europe. Third, the Germans were nowcivilized Christians again and, more than that, good democrats and thefront-line defenders of Christian democracy against atheist tyranny. Fourth,after so much blood and wealth invested, and then balm and wealth invested, thesuspicion persisted that the \"GermanForeword to the 1966 Printingproblem/' whatever it was, had not been solved and would not be solved byrepeated application of the same dosage.The \"German problem\" moves in and out of focus as the twentieth centurycontinues to produce—at an always accelerating tempo—more history than it canconsume. Korea is forgotten, and Hungary, Cyprus, and Suez are the newsensations; Hungary, Cyprus, and Suez slide into sudden oblivion, and we are allagog at Tibet and the Congo; Tibet and the Congo vanish before we have time tofind them on the map (or to find a map that has them) and Cuba explodes; Cubasubsides to something combining a simmer and a snarl, and Vietnam and Rhodesia(or is it Southern Rhodesia?) seize us. Ghana, Guiana, Guinea. Crisis is ourdiet, served up as exotic dishes, and dishes ever more exotic, before we areable to swallow (let alone digest) those that were just before us. Remember the\"Lebanon crisis\" of 1958, in which the United States was deeply involved? Ofcourse not. Who would, these days? Who could? And why?The \"German problem\" is different. It is off center stage sometimes, but it isnever offstage altogether. Most Americans are inattentive to it—they can't beattentive to everything—unless something as pictorial as the Berlin Wall becomesa one-season wonder. (Whatever else it was, the Wall was the worst politicalgaffe since Paris snatched Helen). But to the Europeans—including theGermans—Germany and the Germans are the first order of business every season.The Englishman who remembers the summer of 1940 is dismayed to see the newGerman Wehrmacht conducting exercises on British soil, but he is undismayed todiscover that the new Burger in Uniform with the new innere Fiihrung—the\"civilians in uniform\" with \"self-leadership\"—were a myth successfully designed to lull the uneasiness of Germany'sconquerors.Dummer Michel, the \"little man\" like my ten Nazis, never accepted the myth. Hedrags his goose-stepping feet. He may be as provincial as he ever was, asuninformed as he ever was, as sheltered as he ever was by the shabbiest press inthe western world. He may not know that the clamor for the \"lost lands\" beyondthe Oder-Neisse has no other purpose than to keep him in line, and that thatclamor, like the clamor for reunification, can be satisfied only by a ThirdWorld War. But he is not dumm clear out to the rind. He knows that, for thefirst time in his history, he can earn as as worker five times what he can as asoldier. And he knows that the United States is willing to pay him well for theprivilege of maintaining its own military establishment in his country—toprotect him, of course, from the godless Communist conquest that Goebbelspromised.For five, six, seven years after the Second World War, the German in his ruinswanted only to live. Today he wants to live it up—and why not?—while it lasts.Always while it lasts. The sovietized East German gets out if he can, over orunder or through the Wall, to the golden West of West Berlin and then to thestill more golden West of the Ruhr; and if he can't, he spends what he has assoon as he has it. While it lasts. In the Lowenbrau Keller in Munich thefree-enterprising West German sops up the last of the butter-gravy with the lastof the bread, pushes his plate away, takes a pull at his stein, lights hiscigar, and says, \"When I have it here,\" patting his stomach, \"nobody can take itaway from me.\"Full, and more than full, employment is still the fact in the Federal Republic(and in the Democratic Republic, which the \"lost land\" irridentism of thecynical WesternForeword to the 1966 Printingmap-makers calls \"Middle German/'). But the bloom is off theWirtschaftswunder—the economic miracle—as, soon or late, it always is. The WestGerman inflation is so spectacular that the budget has to be cut—and the cut isachieved by eliminating the increases promised the civil servants and old-agepensioners to offset the cost of inflation. Dummer Michel, whose profit-sharingstocks didn't go up (or actually went down). Dummer Michel, who has no expenseaccount and therefore no share in the miracle—unless he compares his conditionwith that of the ruins twenty years ago. Dummer Michel, who was honest,industrious, dependable, and who, in the general moral decline, has become somuch less of some of these things that the very face of Germany, so efficientlyspick and span before (and in) Hitler's time, is changed by the roadside litter.Dummer Michel, the legendary German Worker, whose legend (perhaps for the best)has lost its hold on him.While it lasts. My ten Nazi friends, when I knew them ten years ago, had neverbelieved that \"it/' the thousand-year Reich, would outlive them—as it didn't.Hitler got them to a pitch and held them there, screaming at them day in and dayout for twelve years. They were uneasy through it all. If they believed inNazism—as all of them did, in substantial part or in all of it—they still gotwhat they could out of it while the getting was good. None of them was astoundedwhen the getting turned bad.While it lasts. The satellite East Germans have the Russians on their backs; myEast German friends persuade me that not 30 per cent of them would support theregime there. The satellite West Germans ply their tools and their trades on thebacks of the generous Americans whose mercenary \"shield\" they know themselves tobe; my West German friends persuade me that not fewer than 90 per cent ofxnthem would support, and, indeed, do support, this thoroughly cynical pretense ofpolicy. In eastern—Communist-Europe my friends persuade me that Germany, Westand East, is the unchanging centerpiece of all policy and all politics in theSoviet Union, Poland and Czechoslovakia.'The 7 ' West Germans want their place in the nuclear sun—the new Lebensraum ofmass-murderous power—to erase the last insult they suffered in beingdemilitarized by the idealistic Americans whose ideals were so sternlypronounced and then so sternly reversed. The Russians forbid the Americans tolet the Germans have that place. But as I am writing I read a sensational andauthoritative headline: GERMAN MISSILES A-TIPPED BY U.S. SIX YEARS AGO, followedby the American government's now commonplace refusal to confirm or deny,followed, a few days later by a dispatch from Washington beginning, \"A DefenseDepartment spokesman acknowledged last night that fighter-bombers of nine NorthAtlantic Treaty Allies, including West Germany, were armed with American nuclearwarheads.\" Control of their use was still in American hands —only theevil-minded Bolsheviks could imagine that the Germans could not be relied uponnever to get out of control.When this book was first published ten years ago, it ended, as it still does,with these words: \"It is risky to let people alone. But it is riskier still topress my ten Nazi friends— and their seventy million countrymen—to re-embracemilitarist anti-Communism as a way of national life.\" If these words had anyvalidity ten years ago, they have some validity today—and even some smallprospective relevance to my own non-Nazi country and my own non-Nazi countrymen.My ten Nazi friends and their seventy million countrymen have been ever moresuccessfully pressed to the national way of life that they so bravely enjoyedand then, at the end,XlllForeword to the 1966 Printingso bravely suffered in Hitler's time. The fact that two-thirds of them embracemilitarist anti-Communism and the other third militarist Communism is only adetail—if a historically fatal detail. What is dreadfully, and demonstrably, badfor the Germans, and thus for the rest of the world, is their exposure to afiery fanaticism that, in a less capable people, would burn itself out with moremodest consequences.The Germans seem to be less frightening now than they were twenty years ago. Ifthey are, it may be because other people are more frightening now than they werethen. Of the trillion dollars the world has spent for war since the Second WorldWar ended, only an inconsequential fraction has been spent by the Germans (whosecivilian enterprises, including armaments manufacture, have prosperedaccordingly). Things have happened elsewhere in the past twenty years that havemade it impossible to claim that Auschwitz is beyond the moral comprehension ofcivilized men. A while back the New York Times' leading correspondent reportedfrom Saigon that \"there comes a time in every war when men tend to becomeindifferent to human suffering, even to unnecessary brutality, and we may bereaching that point in Vietnam.\"The Germans are still the Germans—as aren't we all what we were, or at least nobetter? Who could have supposed ten years ago that they might have beenotherwise? But there were some who so fondly supposed that for the world's good,and therefore for Germany's, a new way would have to be found. To say thatinstead their conquerors have found an old way—the educators re-educated—wouldbe to say much too much at this date. But to say that the Germans, if a new waycan be taught men, would have a harder timefinding teachers today than ten years ago is not to say too little.Where would they have found teachers ten years ago? Where but America? But itwas ten years ago, and twenty, that the United States Air Force (in its ownwords) \"produced more casualties than any other military action in the historyof the world'' in its great fire raid on Tokyo, and Secretary of War Henry L.Stimson, appalled by the absence of public protest in America, thought \"therewas something wrong with a country where no one questioned\" such acts committedin its name (L. Giovannitti and F. Freed, The Decision to Drop the Bomb [NewYork: Coward-McCann, 1965])-Still and all, I thought (and wrote) ten years ago that it might not be arrogantto assume that the Germans still looked to the Americans for light. I shouldchange those words today if I could. I can't, for I love my country and abide inits hope and the hopes men have had of it. \"We had\"—always \"had\"—\"such highhopes that the American might do something. Nobody else could or would, not ourenemies, not our allies, or ourselves.\" It was not to be. \"Something for theGermans,\" if it could have been devised, had to be abandoned to largernecessities. It is clear that it is not to be now; the time, if there was one,has passed. It passed some time before German missiles were A-tipped by the U.S.and some time after the following notice was nailed to the gate of the Americanprisoner-of-war camp in Babenhausen/Darmstadt in 1946:When you, SS-man Willi Schulze, or you, Corporal Rudi Miiller, stride outthrough this gate, your steps will lead you to freedom. Behind you lie monthsand years of slavish obedience,Foreword to the 1966 Printingyears of bloodshed, years in which human individuality suffered incrediblehumiliations, all of which was caused by a criminal regime whose adherents, ifthey have not already paid the penalty, will not escape due punishment.You yourself are not to blame. Deluded, you blindly followed the call of a falsedoctrine. From now on your life in your family circle can unfold free andundisturbed. You have been freed from accursed military service, fromguilt-laden German militarism. Never again will a shrill command chase youacross the barracks courts or drive you to the battlefield. The ashes of yourarmy ID card have mingled with those of Buchenwald and Dachau.The victorious United Nations which, through their great sacrifice, have freedyou and your descendants forever from military service, have assumed theresponsibility of protecting your freedom. But in exchange for that greatsacrifice you are duty-bound to make sure that never again in your homeland willa desire for military service arise, that never again will young Germanssacrifice the best years of their lives to the hankerings of the Prussiannobility and their war-thirsty general staff, but that they will, from now on,dedicate their strength and their gifts to peaceful ends.The notice was signed \"U.S. War Department\"ForewordAs an American, I was repelled by the rise of National Socialism in Germany. Asan American of German descent, I was ashamed. As a Jew, I was stricken. As anewspaperman, I was fascinated.It was the newspaperman's fascination that prevailed—or at leastpredominated—and left me dissatisfied with every analysis of Nazism. I wanted tosee this monstrous man, the Nazi. I wanted to talk to him and to listen to him.I wanted to try to understand him. We were both men, he and I. In rejecting theNazi doctrine of racial superiority, I had to concede that what he had been Imight be; what led him along the course he took might lead me.Man (says Erasmus) learns at the school of example and will attend no other. IfI could find out what the Nazi had been and how he got that way, if I couldspread his example before some of my fellow-men and command their attention toit, I might be an instrument of their learning (and my own) in the age of themass revolutionary dictatorship.In 1935 I spent a month in Berlin trying to obtain a series of meetings withAdolf Hitler. My friend and teacher, William E. Dodd, then American Ambassadorto Germany, did what he could to help me, but without success. Then I traveledin Nazi Germany for an American magazine. I saw the German people, people I hadknown when I visited Germany as a boy, and for the first time realized thatForewordNazism was a mass movement and not the tyranny of a diabolical few over helplessmillions. Then I wondered if Adolf Hitler was, after all, the Nazi I wanted tosee. By the time the war was over I had identified my man: the average German.I wanted to go to Germany again and get to know this literate, bourgeois,'Western'' man like myself to whom something had happened that had not (or atleast not yet) happened to me and my fellow-countrymen. It was seven years afterthe war before I went. Enough time had passed so that an American non-Nazi mighttalk with a German Nazi, and not so much time that the events of 1933-45, andespecially the inner feeling that attended those events, would have beenforgotten by the man I sought.I never found the average German, because there is no average German. But Ifound ten Germans sufficiently different from one another in background,character, intellect, and temperament to represent, among them, some millions ortens of millions of Germans and sufficiently like unto one another to have beenNazis. It wasn't easy to find them, still less to know them. I brought with meone asset: I really wanted to know them. And another, acquired in my longassociation with the American Friends Service Committee: I really believed thatthere was \"that of God\" in every one of them.My faith found that of God in my ten Nazi friends. My newspaper training foundthat of something else in them, too. They were each of them a most marvelousmixture of good and bad impulses, their lives a marvelous mixture of good andbad acts. I liked them. I couldn't help it. Again and again, as I sat or walkedwith one or another of my ten friends, I was overcome by the same sensation thathad got in the way of my newspaper reporting in Chicago years be-xvinfore. I liked Al Capone. I liked the way he treated his mother. He treated herbetter than I treated mine.I found—and find—it hard to judge my Nazi friends. But I confess that I wouldrather judge them than myself. In my own case I am always aware of theprovocations and handicaps that excuse, or at least explain, my own bad acts. Iam always aware of my good intentions, my good reasons for doing bad things. Ishould not like to die tonight, because some of the things that I had to dotoday, things that look very bad for me, I had to do in order to do somethingvery good tomorrow that would more than compensate for today's bad behavior. Butmy Nazi friends did die tonight; the book of their Nazi lives is closed, withouttheir having been able to do the good they may or may not have meant to do, thegood that might have wiped out the bad they did.By easy extension, I would rather judge Germans than Americans. Now I see alittle better how Nazism overcame Germany—not by attack from without or bysubversion from within, but with a whoop and a holler. It was what most Germanswanted—or, under pressure of combined reality and illusion, came to want. Theywanted it; they got it; and they liked it.I came back home a little afraid for my country, afraid of what it might want,and get, and like, under pressure of combined reality and illusion. I felt—andfeel—that it was not German Man that I had met, but Man. He happened to be inGermany under certain conditions. He might be here, under certain conditions. Hemight, under certain conditions, be I.If I—and my countrymen—ever succumbed to that concatenation of conditions, noConstitution, no laws, no police, and certainly no army would be able to protectus from harm. For there is no harm that anyone else can do toForeworda man that he cannot do to himself, no good that he cannot do if he will. Andwhat was said long ago is true; Nations are made not of oak and rock but of men,and, as the men are, so will the nations be.My compulsion to go to Germany and to live there, in a small town, with my wifeand children was spurred by Carl Friedrich von Weizsacker, of GottingenUniversity, who, with his wife Gundi, lived in my home while he served asVisiting Professor of Physics at the University of Chicago in 1948-49. Icorresponded with an old friend, James M. Read, who was serving as Chief ofEducational and Cultural Relations in the United States High Commission for theOccupation of Germany. Messrs. Read and Weizsacker converged on Max Horkheimer,Dean of the Institute for Social Research, in Frankfurt University, and hearranged my appointment. What I did after I got there (and after I got back) wasmy own responsibility, but where I went was the responsibility of my threefriends. It was they who packed me off to live for a year, as close as possibleto the Germans, as far as possible from the conquering \"Ami,\" in the town I callKronenberg.MILTON MAYERCARMEL, CALIFORNIA December 25, 1954ContentsPART I.

The great E-bell of theKatherine Church has begun to strike the hour. Between its seventh and eighthstrokes, the Parish bell begins to strike. You would suppose that the sacristanof the Parish Church had been awakened by the Katherine bell, pulled himself outof bed, and got to his bell rope just in time to avoid complete humiliation(like a man running shirtless and shoeless to a wedding to get there before theceremony is over). But you would probably be wrong, for every night, ever sincethere have been two bells in Kronen-berg, the first stroke from the ParishChurch has come just after the seventh from the Katherine; in deference,perhaps, for the Katherine Church was once (up until the Reformation a centuryago) a cathedral.Now Kronenberg has, besides two church bells and two churches, six thousandchurched souls; and a university, with a theological faculty and almost ahundred students; and a Castle, which crowns the hill on which the closelypacked, semicircular town is built (a hill so steep in places that some of thehouses can be entered only from the top floor); and a river at the foot of thehill, the Werne. The Werne isn't navigable this far up from the Rhine, but itsKronenbergcourse around the flowering hill conspires with the Castle at the top, themassed gables of the timbered old houses that climb to the edge of the Castlepark, and the cobblestoned lanes and alleys that gird the hillside like tangledhoops, to make of Kronenberg a picture-book town on a picture-book countryside.The town has had its troubles, as what town hasn't? In the half-dozen centuriespast it has changed hands a dozen times. It has been stormed, taken, liberated,and stormed and taken again. But it has never been burned; its pretti-ness (forit is small enough to be pretty rather than beautiful) may have shamed off thetorches which have gutted so many old towns; and now, in 1638, Kronenberg isalways designated as \"old Kronenberg,\" an ancient place.The Great War of Europe is twenty years old, but maybe it is over; the Prince ofHesse has decided to join the Peace of Prague, to drive the Protestant Swedesout of the Catholic Empire without, it is hoped, incurring submission to theCatholic Emperor in Vienna. True, Catholic Fiance has just attacked CatholicSpain and, in alliance with Protestant Sweden, has just declared war on theEmperor. But Kronenberg has only heard vaguely about these wonderful events, andwho knows what they mean? \"The King makes war, and the people die\"; it's an old,old saying in Kronenberg.Times have been very hard everywhere these last years, in Kronenberg, too; taxesand tolls always higher, men, animals, and grain taken, always more, for thearmies. But the war, moving from north to south, from south to north, and fromnorth to south again, has spared the town, except for a siege which was drivenoff by the Protestant armies. All in all, the Kronenbergers can't complain. Andthey don't.Pestilence and famine recur in Kronenberg—-as where don't they?—and, where thereare Jews, what is one to expect? After the Black Death of 1348, the Judenschule,or prayer-house, was burned in Kronenberg, and the Jews were driven away.(Everyone knew they had poisoned the wells, all over Europe.) A few yearsafterward the finances of the Prince of Hesse were so straitened that he had topawn Kronenberg to the Jews in Frankfurt, but in 1396 Good King Wenceslausdeclared void all debts to the Christ-killers. But that wasn't the end of it,because the princes always brought the Jews back, to do the un-Chris-tianbusiness of banking forbidden Christians by canon law. So it was, until 1525,when the Burgermeister of Kronenberg implored the Prince to drive the Jews outagain. \"They buy stolen articles,\" he said. \"If they were gone, there would beno more stealing/' So the Prince drove them out again; but he exercised theimperial privilege given by Karl V to keep a certain number of Jews in the townon the condition that they pay a protection tax, a Schutzgeld. If they failed topay the Schutzgeld, the Prince removed his protection.Those were good times, before the Great War of Europe. Times are hard now; butthey might be worse (and nearly everywhere are) than they are in Kronenberg, andtonight the burghers and their manservants and their maidservants are sleepingcontented, or as contented as burghers and their manservants and maidservantsmay reasonably expect to be in this life. So are their summer-fattened cattleand their sheep in the meadows (it is not yet cold in early November), and theirpigs and chickens and geese and ducks in the barn at the back of the house;sleeping, all, at ten o'clock.The two church bells are dissonant, the Parish bell's A-flat ground tone againstthe Katharine's E; workmanshipKronenbergis not what it was when the Katherine bell was cast three or four centuries ago.But it takes more than the dissonance of the bells to awaken the people ofKronenberg. It takes even more than the rooster on top of the Town Hall to doit.The Town Hall rooster is a wonderful rooster. It flaps its wings and crows aheroic crow, once for the quarter-hour, twice for the half-hour, three times forthe three-quarter-hour, and four times for the hour—and then it crows the hour.If (as it does) it begins its ten o'clock crow when the Katherine bell isfinished and the Parish bell has just struck its sixth stroke, the fault cannotbe the rooster's, for the bell-ringers are human and fallible, but the roosteris mechanical. To say that the rooster was wrong would be to say that the TownClock was wrong, and this no one says.Now the dissonance of the two bells is as nothing to the cacophony of therooster and the last four strokes of the Parish bell; still the Kronenbergerssleep. They sleep until their own flesh-and-blood roosters respond to thecrowing atop the Town Hall. The response begins, naturally, in the barns anddooryards near by and fans out in an epidemic descent down the whole Kronenberghill. The roosters awaken the ducks and the geese, then the pigs and the sheep;then the cattle stir and low, The house dogs are the last to be heard from, but,once begun barking, they are the last to stop.All Kronenberg turns over underneath its mountainous feather beds. Everyonehalf-awakens with the dissymphony, remains half-awake until it is over, and thenslips back, but not all the way back, into sleep. The Kronenbergers have yet tohave their ten o'clock lullaby, the lullaby they have had, and their ancestorsbefore them, every night of their lives, the Night Watchman's Stundenrufe, orcalling of the hours.Every night the Night Watchman stands in the Market Place until the clatter ofthe bells and the animals is ended; an old pensioner in the raiment of hisoffice, a long green greatcoat and a high-crowned green hat, his horn slung overhis bad:, his lantern in one hand, his pikestaff in the other. Staff, lantern,and horn, Night Watchman himself, are increasingly ornamental nowadays. As hemakes his hourly round, he watches for fires, which are rare in cautious,pinchpenny old Kronenberg, and for a still rarer pig broken out from a barn.But he has his dignity, this man who, if only symbolically these days, has thecommunity in his care; he will not compete with roosters and geese. When thelast echo of the clatter has died—and not before—he puts his horn to his lipsand blows it ten times and then begins his descent through the town, clumpingheavy-booted on the cobblestones, singing the Kronenbergers back to sleep:Jiorf f tfir Jierrn, una tassz euca sa - gen, (Hear,ye townsfolk, honest men,)3=Si iUns - re Olock hat zehn ge - schla - gen. (Hear, our clock has just struck ten,)KronenbergBy this time, of course, the Town Hall rooster has long since crowed his onecrow for 10:15.Jf«?7z - schen-wa - M0& ^«^^ nichts nut - zen; (Watchmen's watching won'tprotect you;)rmussschut-zen. (God must watch you, God protect you.)itedei - n<?(Lord, by thy e'erlasting might,)Macht,'iGib uns ei • ne gu - te Nacht.(Give us all a quiet night.)Holding his lantern aloft, the Night Watchman goes through the town, as hiscounterpart goes through every town in Germany, singing this self-same lullabyfrom teno'clock on. A few minutes before eleven (or after; who knows?) he is back at theMarket Place, and when the eleven o'clock racket is over, he blows his horn andagain makes his round. This time, instead of singing \"Zehn Gebote setzf Gottein,\" he sings \"Elf der Jiinger blieben treu, Hilf dass wir im Tod ohn' Reu\"(\"Christ's eleven served him true, May we die without one's rue\"); at twelve hesings \"Zwolf, das ist das Ziel der Zeit; Mensch, bedenk die Ewigkeit\" (\"Twelvesets men from this day free; Think ye of Eternity\"); and at one he sings \"Binsist allein der ew'ge Gott, Der uns tragt aus aller Not\" (\"One alone is alwaysthere, He who lifts us up from care\").From one o'clock on, until dawn, the Night Watchman sings no more. His song hasno more stanzas and certainly no more listeners. Each hour, after the bells andthe beasts subside, he blows his horn and makes his round, and the Kronenbergerssleep. Should one of them awaken and see a light outside, he knows whose it isand sleeps again. The town will be up at dawn; the day ends at dark. Everyoneworks, nobody reads, and tallow, except in the university, the hospital, and theCastle, is burned for only an hour or two to feed house stock and mend harnessor stockings by.Just outside the Town Wall, where the toll road along the Werne enters the townat the Frankfurt Gate, stand a half-dozen new houses around a burgeoning squarecalled \"Frankfurterplatz.\" The town is getting bigger, overflowing the new wallof two centuries ago as it has overflowed each successive ring of walls thatprotected it. The days when the town hugged the Castle for protection are over;this is the middle of the seventeenth century of Christianity, and men may liveoutside the walls without much danger.At the corner of Frankfurterplatz, where a wide, un-cobblestoned road runs westoutside the wall and along it,Kronenberga nameless road known as the Mauerweg, is the new inn, the Jagerhof, theHuntsmen's Rest. It is a fine two-storied place with a commodious dormitoryabove, a public room and a private room (or clubroom) below, and the innkeeper'sfamily quarters in back.Tonight the lights are burning late in the public room of the Huntsmen's Rest.The old soldiers, the Home Reserve company, are celebrating with a stein of beeror two the fifteenth anniversary of the liberation of the homeland from theshackles of Vienna. The Home Reserve company are patriotic Hessians, of course,but first and last they are Kronenbergers, and it was fifteen years ago tonightthat the siege of Kronenberg was lifted. A great event for the old soldiers, anda great anniversary.It is after midnight when, with two steins of beer or three or four inside them,they leave the Huntsmen's Rest, some of the more patriotic old boys bent oncontinuing the celebration. The innkeeper does not want to get into trouble withthe old soldiers or the authorities, and the instant the soldiers are gone hecomes in from the back, snuffs out the lights, and goes to bed.November 9, 1938:\"HEAR, YE TOWNSFOLK, HONEST MEN\"The public room of the Huntsmen's Rest, at the corner of Frankfurterplatz andthe Mauerweg, is alight tonight and crowded with a company of old soldierscelebrating the fifteenth anniversary of the liberation of the homeland from thechains of Versailles. It is the anniversary of the \"Bloody Parade\" in Munich, inwhich the Fiihrer was arrested and imprisoned. The old soldiers are the HomeReserve Troop of the Nazi Sturmabteilung, or SA, and the Huntsmen's Rest istheir regular meeting place.Their regular meeting night is Friday, and this is Wednesday. But November 9,whatever the day of the week, is the greatest of all National Socialist Partycelebrations. January 30 (the day the Fiihrer came to power) and April 20 (theFiihrer's birthday) are national celebrations. November 9 is the Party's own.The formal celebration was at 7:30 P.M. in the Municipal Theater. There were toomany speeches, as usual, and one of the Party's poets, Siegfried Ruppel, recitedtoo many of his Party poems. Then the four troops of the SA Kro-nenberg marchedin uniform to their regular meeting places, the Reserve Troop to the upstairsroom of the Huntsmen's Rest. Promotions were announced, as they always were onKronenbergNovember 9, and then the troop followed Sturmfiihrer Schwenke down to the publicroom for a glass of beer or two. It is ten o'clock.\"HEAR, OUR CLOCK HAS JUST STRUCK TEN\"Ten o'clock, precisely, and if you want to check your watch you may get thehourly beep on the National Radio or the half-minute tone signal on PrimeMeridian Time by dialing 6 on the telephone. The mechanically operated ParishChurch bell begins to strike the hour after the seventh stroke of the CatherineChurch bell, which is also mechanically operated. As the sixth stroke of theParish bell dies away, the mechanical rooster crows atop the Town Hall, afleshly rooster here and there in the town responds, a few dogs bark, an ox in afar field lows, and the town is quiet. Tradition has it that the two bells andthe Town Hall rooster have been dissynchronous for centuries.Ten o'clock. The policemen on the beat open their corner telephone boxes andreport, \"Schmidt speaking. All in order,\" and the sergeant on duty says, \"Good.\"The lights are going out except in the cinemas, the inns and hotels, theuniversity clinics and the students' rooms and professors' studies, in thestreetcars and the railroad station and the crossings, and at the street cornersdimly lighted by one high-hung bulb.Kronenberg is a quiet little university town of twenty thousand people—twotowns, really, the university and the town, although the university, like allContinental universities, is scattered through the town instead of having acampus.Eveiything has always been quiet in Kronenberg. In theyears that led up to National Socialism there was an occasional street fight,and one or two meetings of Nazis or Social Democrats were broken up. (TheCommunists were too weak to organize meetings.) In 1930, when Party uniformswere forbidden, the Party paraded quietly in white shirts, and, when the Fiihrerspoke in Kronenberg in 1932, forty thousand people crowded quietly into asuper-circus tent on the Town Meadow to hear him. (Nazi open-air meetings wereforbidden.) That was the day that a Swastika flag was run up on the Castle; inEngland or France it might have been taken for a college-boy prank, but inKronenberg the culprit, who proudly admitted his guilt, was heavily fined.Kronenberg went quietly Nazi, and so it was. In the March, 1933, elections, theNSDAP, the National Socialist German Workers Party, had a two-thirds majority,and the Social Democrats went out of office. Only the university— and not thewhole university—and the hard-core Social Democrats held out until the end, andin nonindustrial Kronenberg there were no trade-unions to hold the mass base ofthe Social Democrats. The town was as safely Nazi now, in 1938, as any town inGermany.Of course Kronenberg isn't Germany. To begin with, it's in Hesse, and Hesse isconservative, \"backward,\" if you will; when city people elsewhere want to call aman stupid, they call him a blinder Hesse, a \"blind Hessian.\" And Kronenberg, soold and changeless, off the main line and the Autobahn, is conservative even forHesse. But its very conservatism is a better guaranty of the Party's stabilitythan the radicalism of the cities, where yesterday's howling Communists aretoday's howling Nazis and nobody knows just how they will howl tomorrow. A quiettown is best.Kronenberg\"TEN COMMANDMENTS GOD HAS GIVEN\"The talk in the public room of the Huntsmen's Rest is (as might be expected ofold soldiers) of old times, and Sturmf iihrer Schwenlce does more than his shareof talking, as usual. But you have to hand it to him, he knows how to tell astory; when a character in the story roars, Schwenlce doesn't say he roared—heroars himself. He tells how the SA Kronenberg got its orders fifteen years agoto assemble on November 9 and await word for the Putsch. There were 185 of them,waiting for trucks to take them to Frankfurt. They waited all day. The wordnever came, the trucks never came.\"I wasn't too disappointed,\" says Schwenke. 'The time was too soon. I alwayssaid so. That's the trouble with the men at the top—they stand between theFiihrer and men like me who know the people and the conditions. N';'a [which inHessian dialect means \"Yep\" or \"So\"], when the Fiihrer got out of prison andreorganized the Party and accepted only those he knew were faithful to him, thatwas the right principle. With that principle, selecting the best, nothing couldstop us.\"The talk turns to another historic November 9, in 1918, and here again theSturmfuhrer does most of the talking: \"I was on duty in Erfurt that night. ABolshevik in civilian clothes came to the post and wanted to talk to thesoldiers. The men chose me to represent them. The Bolshevik said we should jointhe townspeople and form a Workers and Soldiers Council. I said we would formour own Councils without any Reds. He said they had three cannon trained on thepost, and I said we had two machine guns trained on them and we'd take ourchances. They didn't have any cannon, and we didn't have any machine guns, but Ihol-lered him down.\" \"I'll bet you did,\" says one of the younger SA men, who hasdrifted in from another troop.Somehow the talk drags this evening. Something is up, no one seems to know what.Two days ago the German Councilor of Embassy in Paris, vom Rath, was shot by aPolish Jew. Immediately an intense campaign against the Jews began on the GermanNational Radio. Are Germans to be sitting ducks all over the world for Jewmurderers? Are the German people to stand helpless while the Fiihre/srepresentatives are shot down by the Jew swine? Are the Schweinehunde to get offscot free? Is the wrath of the German People against the Israelite scum to berestrained any longer? \"If vom Rath dies, the Jews of Germany will answer to theGerman People, not tomorrow, but today. The German People have suffered longenough from the parasite assassins.\"This was the work of Dr. Goebbels, whom most people hated and nobody loved; evenin Schwenke's loyal circle the Minister of Propaganda and Public Enlightenmentwas known, quietly, as Jupp der Stelzfuss, Joey the Crip. The university peopledidn't listen to this kind of broadcast—or, if they listened, they listenedfearfully. The townspeople— the townspeople just listened. They listened as thecampaign mounted hourly. Vom Rath's condition grew hourly worse. He was certainto die, and he died, on November 9, on the anniversary of the greatest day inthe history of the German People, the day on which the liberators of theHomeland had shed their blood for liberty in Munich fifteen years ago.All afternoon and evening the pitch has been mounting over the radio, and by nowthe Daily Kronenberger has joined in. Everywhere there are rumors. \"Somethingwill happen.\" What?KronenbergAt the celebration in the Municipal Theater, earlier this evening, nothing wassaid about vom Rath or the Jews; strange. The spirit of repression isinfectious; at the Huntsmen's Rest, where, ordinarily, SA men (SA men,particularly) tell stories of Jewish depravity and the SA's leadership in theJudenkampf, nothing is said this evening about the Jews, or even about themurder in Paris. No one knows why. \"Something will happen/' No one knows what,\"WHO OBEYS THEM WILL BE SHRIVEN*'The door of the Huntsmen's Rest opens, and the commander of the SA Kronenberg,Standartenfiihrer Kiihling, enters, in uniform.\"Attention/\" says Sturmfuhrer Schwenke.The SA men stand.\"Heil Hitler/\" says Sturmfuhrer Schwenke, saluting.\"Heil. Be seated,\" says the Standartenfiihrer, without returning the salute.The SA men sit.\"Sturmfuhrer, kommen Sie mal her, come here a minute,\" says theStandartenfiihrer. Schwenke rises and comes to him.The Standartenfiihrer says, \"Heute geht die Synagogue hoch, The synagogue willbe burned tonight.\"It is almost midnight.CHAPTER 1Ten Men1. Karl-Heinz Schwenke, Sturmfiihrer and janitor (formerly tailor), age 54It was almost midnight of November 9, 1938, when Stand-artenfiihrer Kiihling ofthe SA Kronenberg entered the Huntsmen's Rest, at the corner of Frankfurterplatzand the Mauerweg, and said:\"The synagogue will be burned tonight/'As the scene was reconstructed by principals and witnesses fifteen yearsafterward, there were present in the public room of the inn twenty ortwenty-five uniformed members of the SA Reserve Troop, composed of men overfifty, and five or ten members of other SA troops who had dropped in. There wereno other customers, and the innkeeper testified in 1948 that he was \"in and out\"of the public room that evening and did not hear any of the conversation orremember who was present.After Kiihling spoke, Sturmfiihrer Schwenke turned to the men in the public roomand said:\"You heard what the Standartenfuhrer said. Those who want to help, come into theprivate room with me.\"The Standartenfuhrer said, Til be back/' and left the inn.About half the men present, according to the testimony, followed Schwenke intothe private room and closed theTen Mendoor. Schwenke reopened the door from within, said, \"No more drinking,\" andclosed it again. Those who were left in the public room sat saying nothing for afew moments and then began talking in low tones. They testified afterward thatthey could hear the talk, but not the words, from the other room.Twenty minutes later the Standartenfiihrer re-entered the Huntsmen's Rest. Thedozen or so men left in the public room were eating buttered bread and drinkingcoffee, playing Skat, reading the paper, or just sitting there. They got totheir feet and said, \"Heil Hit—\"\"They still in there?\" said the Standartenfiihrer.\"Yes, Herr Standartenfiihrer.\"The Standartenfiihrer opened the door to the private room and the talk insidestopped. The dozen or so men within got to their feet and said, \"Heil Hit—\"\"Jetzt maJ, Jos/ Jos/ Let's get going, let's get going,\" said theStandartenfiihrer, standing in the doorway. \"You, Sturmfiihrer.\"\"Yes, Herr Standartenfiihrer,\" said Schwenke. \"I thought I would send two men toreconnoiter.\"\"You be one of them, Sturmfiihrer.\"\"Yes, Herr Standartenfiihrer. Here, Kramer, come with me. The rest of you,remain where you are until you get orders.\"\"I'll be back,\" said the Standartenfiihrer, leaving again.Schwenke and Kramer walked west on the Mauerweg. Half a block down, in front ofthe Caf6 Schuchardt, they stopped and stood in the entrance of the darkenedcafe. Kramer looked up and down the street. \"No police,\" he said. \"Not a sign,\"said Schwenke.They crossed the street to the synagogue, pushed open the iron fence gate, andwent around the building, try-ing the side and back doors. The furnace-room door was unlocked, and they wentin. In a few minutes they left again. As they re-entered the private room of theHuntsmen's Rest, the men stood up and said, \"Heil—\"\"Pechmann,\" said Schwenke, \"I want you and Heinecke and—let me see—Dowe.Upstairs. Quick, You\"—to the others—\"remain. This is duty. You hear me?\"The five, including Kramer, went upstairs to the SA meeting room. In a fewminutes they came down.\"I don't care/' Schwenke was saying, \"we can use it We have to have something.\"\"But it's floor oil,\" said Pechmann, \"and it belongs to the Theater.\"\"I don't care,\" said Schwenke, \"it's oil. This is duty. You heard theStandartenfiihrer, Pechmann.\"\"Yes, Herr Sturmfuhrer,\" said Pechmann.Pechmann, Heinecke, and Dowe headed for the Theater, a block west of theHuntsmen's Rest, and Schwenke and Kramer returned to the furnace-room of thesynagogue. In a few minutes the other three SA men entered the furnace-room,carrying, among them, four three-gallon canisters. There were footsteps above,in the synagogue.\"Can I go now?\" said Pechmann to Schwenke, in a whisper. \"I'm on duty at six inthe morning.\"\"Go ahead, you s 1,\" said Schwenke.\"Thank you, Herr Sturmfuhrer,\" said Pechmann. Heinecke and Dowe left with him,without even asking permission.\"S ts,\" said Schwenke.Pechmann testified against Schwenke after the war, but he supported Schwenke'sclaim that there were footsteps heard in the synagogue above when the SA menwere in the furnace-room. Schwenke denied having had anythingTen Mento do with the floor oil taken from the Theater; he had, he said, onlyreconnoitered. The four canisters were never found.Schwenke and Kramer returned to the Huntsmen's Rest around 12:50 midnight. TheSturmfiihrer led the way to a table in the corner of the public room. Tenminutes passed. Nobody spoke in the public room; the men in the private room,beyond the door, were still talking in a murmur. The two church bells struck 1A.M., and the rooster atop the Town Hall crowed. Then it was quiet again.Schwenke said something to Kramer, and Kramer left the inn. None of the men inthe private room raised his head. Kramer returned and said something toSchwenke. Then Schwenke left the inn and returned at once.\"SA men!\" he called. 'The synagogue is on fire! Outside, everybody! Close offthe street! It's dangerous!\"A voice said, \"Shall we call the Fire Department?\"\"I'm in charge!\" said Schwenke. \"Close off the street! It's dangerous! Schnell,hurry!\" And he turned and went, followed by all the SA men in the inn.The instant the last man was out the door, the innkeeper of the Huntsmen's Restentered the public room from the swinging door behind the bar. He closed theouter door to the street, locked it, turned out the lights, and went right tobed.2. Gustav Schwenke, soldier (formerly unemployed tailor's apprentice), age 26Neuhausen is a little summer resort on the Mariasee, an hour by the Post bus,two hours (and twenty-two cents more expensive) by the Scenic Steamer, from theold mining and textile town of Lich, in southern Austria. The Pension GoldenerEngel—the Golden Angel Boarding House—had no guests the night of November 9, 1938, except Private Gustav Schwenke ofthe German Military Police and his bride of a month. It was their honeymoon.It was, as a matter of fact, their first time together since the three terribledays they'd had in Kronenberg when they were married a month before. If Gustavhad decided, at the last minute, not to take the Scenic Steamer from Lich but totake the Post bus and save on the fare, it had to be admitted that he had hireda very nice room at the Goldener Engel. He got the military rate, of course,with a seasonal discount and (after hard bargaining with the host, while thebride stood by) the special three-day discount (even though the Schwenkes weregoing to be there only two days, the duration of Gustav's pass from his post atLich).Those three terrible days in Kronenberg, after the wedding in October, they hadstayed at the groom's home, with the groom's father and mother and youngersister and very young brother. The groom's father, SA Sturmfiihrer Schwenke, hadbeen against the marriage because the bride's father was not even a Partymember, and the bride (for all Sturmfiihrer Schwenke knew; she never saidanything) might even be a Gegner, an opponent of the regime. Frau SturmfiihrerSchwenke hated the bride from the first and said that the girl's family had \"ahistory of fits.\" In those three days in Kronenberg, after the wedding, thebride had cried all the time (and Gustav hated crying), and Frau SturmfiihrerSchwenke said, \"She can't help it, poor girl-it's hereditary.\"Sturmfiihrer Schwenke had wanted his oldest son to marry a strong Partywoman—any strong Party woman. The boy was not a Party enthusiast, except foranti-Semitism. He was willing to join the Party in '32—glad to—when his fathergot him the first job he'd ever had, in the SA police.Ten MenBut that was for the job. A job, any job, was all he cared about. A good boy,but he didn't have his father's spirit.No wonder. And great wonder that he had any spirit at all.Gustav Schwenke had wet his bed until he was twenty-two years old.His mother, whose happiest topic of conversation was sickness (she herself hadhad plenty of it, but her husband \"had never been sick a day in his life/*except for his war wounds), told everybody in Kronenberg about her trouble withGustav, the problem child. Everybody in Kronenberg knew that Gustav Schwenke wasa bed-wetter, and Gustav knew that they knew, and he knew how they knew.Long before he was twelve he hated his mother. One whistle from his father, andhe came; a thousand whistles from his mother, and he hid. When he was twelve,his mother was pregnant. She said to him, \"What if it's a little brother?\" andhe said, \"If he cries at night, I'll cut his throat.\" Little Robert, when hecame, cried at night, and when he cried Gustav wet his bed. Little Robert wethis, of course. \"That's why he cries,\" his mother told Gustav, \"because he'sashamed of wetting his bed.\" Gustav never cried.Gustav had to pull his little brother around after school, in the play wagon,and the other kids, besides calling him Bettnasser, called him Kfndermadchen,nurse girl. One day, in order to play, Gustav left the wagon, with little Robertin it, at the top of a long flight of stone steps leading down from the MarketPlace, and somehow the wagon went down the steps. A man stopped it halfway down,and Robert fell out and cried. Robert wasn't hurt, but Gustav got the worstbeating of his life.When Gustav was fifteen and his father's apprentice,the Schwenke tailor-shop failed, and the whole family went on the dole. It wasthen that Gustav discovered that his father was more interested in politics thanin work and would take bread out of his family's mouth in order to make himselfa uniform or take a trip to the Nazi Party Day in Munich or Weimar or Nuremberg.His father a spendthrift, and the family hungry. Gustav had always been stingy,a saver of food, scraps of cloth, nails; now he became a real miser, and a miserhe remained, with, unfortunately, nothing to save, even in his young manhood,but food, scraps of cloth, nails.The room at the Goldener Engel on the Mariasee was nice but expensive. Still, aman wasn't married every day. And when Gustav was away from Kronenberg, hedidn't feel so bad about spending something. He didn't feel so bad aboutanything. Away from Kronenberg your bride didn't cry and your mother didn't talkand your father didn't buy himself uniforms and you didn't wet your bed and thewagon didn't go down the steps and you would never go back to Kronenberg and youdidn't care what they were doing there or anywhere else tonight. It was afterone o'clock in the morning when Private Gustav Schwenke fell asleep by the sideof his bride in the Pension Goldener Engel, three hundred miles from the burningsynagogue in Kronenberg.3. Carl Klingelhofer, cabinetmaker (and adjutant to the Chief of the KronenbergVolunteer Fire Department) , age 36The telephone rang by the side of the Klingelhofers' bed in their house on theAltstrasse, in Kronenberg—the telephone by the bed, not the fire alarm on thewall. It was the cabinetmaker's sister calling, Frau Schuchardt, whose hus-Ten Menband Fritz had the Caf6 Schuchardt on the Mauerweg. Her voice was a frightenedwhisper: \"Carl, the synagogue is burning. Inside. Schwer, bad/' It was 1:25 A.M.Klingelhofer got into his clothes, his boots, and his fire coat and onto hisbicycle. He could have phoned the night-alarm man or, en route to the Mauerweg,have pulled the alarm in front of the Katherine Church; but he didn't. He had topedal slowly down the cobbled Altstrasse; but then, on the pavedHermann-Goring-Strasse and the Werneweg to Frankfurterplatz, he went at racingspeed, a man who (besides flute-playing and picture-painting) had always donephysical work, an old hiking-club man, who at thirty-six had the wind of a boy.There were no policemen at the scene; the Mauerweg was closed off by SA men. ButGerman firemen at the scene of a fire automatically have the status of uniformedpolicemen, and Klingelhofer went through the SA cordon and the gate of thesynagogue lawn, Smoke had begun to pour through broken windows, heavy blacksmoke. \"Oil,\" said the fireman, even before he smelled it. On the side away fromthe smoke he shone his flashlight into the building. What caught hisprofessional eye was the fact that the fire was burning in several separatedspots: arson.The Sturmfiihrer Schwenke ignored him as he ran across the street to hisbrother-in-law's cafe and banged on the door; and when Fritz Schuchardt sleepily(or apparently so) opened the door, Klingelhofer ran in and phoned the alarmman. \"Got it already,\" said the alarm man. \"Your buzzer at home rang at 1:38.\"Klingelhofer, hearing the fire bells in the street, broke off.As the first company pulled up, there was an immense whoosh; the rose windows inthe synagogue dome had been broken by the updraft, and the sparks flew up in thesky.The top of the wooden dome was almost as high as the wood-shingled roofs of thetimbered old houses on the Adolf-Hitler-Strasse (formerly Hochstrasse), a streetbuilt up on the ruins of the old Town Wall in back of the synagogue. If thehouses up there caught, the town would go. Adjutant Klingelhofer advised theFire Chief to send two of the three Kronenberg companies up to theHitler-Strasse —in his excitement he called it Hochstrasse—and call thecompanies from the villages of Kummerfeld and Ridding, eight and eleven milesaway, to replace them at the synagogue. The Chief agreed, and Klingelhofer got asearchlight and broke in the front doors of the burning building. The benchesand prayer stands had all been piled on and around the wooden stage at thecenter of the prayer hall, where, at the base of the updraft, the fire wasfiercest. The dome was supported by four wooden pillars, issuing from thecorners of the stage. The pediments of the four pillars could not be seen in theflame; up above, they were blackened.A little groggy, the fireman went around the edge of the floor and into asmaller rtoom, the vestry, perhaps. There was a chest. He broke it open andscooped up its contents, some sort of altar cloths and sets of embroideredhangings. He went out through the prayer hall. In front of the gate to the lawnstood a policeman now—one policeman—and Klingelhofer turned the stuff over tohim. It was three o'clock in the morning.There was no killing the updraft; the dome itself was glowing now. A section ofit fell in with a roar; a column of fire shot up in the air. It would bedangerous to enter the prayer hall now, on account of the pillars. Klingelhoferwent back in carefully. Now that the dome was partly gone, the draft wasstronger above, and the lower sections of theTen Mentwo front pillars could be seen. One was burned, about four feet up, to adiameter of two-and-a-half inches or so; the other, though burned at the sameheight, looked as if it would hold. But the two back pillars could not be seen.The smoke was being carried off faster now and, with his searchlight,Klingelhofer saw on the east wall of the prayer hall a set of gold-embroideredhangings like those he had got from the chest. They were charred, and he sawthat something was built into the wall behind them. When I asked him, many yearslater, if he knew what it was, he said \"No,\" and when I told him that it was theArk of the Covenant, he said, 'The Ark of the Covenant. . . . Well, well.\" Hehimself was a vestryman of the Parish Church.4. Htinrich Damm, Party headquarters office manager (formerly unemployedsalesman), age 28Heinrich Damm was a country boy, though he'd been in the town ten years now; hewas home from the Party anniversary celebration at 9:15, and at 9:30 he was inbed and asleep in his apartment in the attic of the Kreisleitung, Partyheadquarters for Kronenberg. But he slept light that night; there had been talkaround town, and from SA headquarters in the basement of the Kreisleitung hadcome rumors of out-of-town visitors and unusual activity. He heard a noisedownstairs and went down, It was the Kreis-leiter, the County Leader.\"What brings you here, boss?\" said Damm. (Like all country people, he had a hardtime with new titles like Herr Kreisleiter, but nobody cared in Damm's case; hecould deal with country people like nobody else in the organization.)\"Some work to finish up/' said the Kreisleiter, without looking up.Damm went back to bed.It was three o'clock in the morning when a crash somewhere awakened him. Therewas a glow in the direction of the Hitler-Strasse and sparks shooting up. In tenminutes— and without awakening his hard-sleeping country-girl wife —he reachedthe synagogue. SA men and firemen were all over the place. One policeman stoodin front of the gate to the lawn. A few spectators (remarkably few, for such abig fire) stood outside the SA cordon. Damm muttered, \"Blod-sinn, idiocy/' andwent back home. He woke up his wife and told her.\"What do you think, Heinrich?\" she said. She always asked Heinrich what hethought about things.\"JBlodsinn,\" he said. \"Would they have stopped us by burning our headquarters?\"He was undressing when his phone rang. It was the Kreisleiter, at home. \"Can youbring your car, Heinrich? We've got to go out in the country/' The Kreisleiter,whose father had been a professor, always took Heinrich Damm with him when hehad to go out in the country.On the way to Spelle, the next big town, they said nothing. As they enteredSpelle, the Kreisleiter said, \"What do you think, Heinrich?\"\"What do you think, boss?\"\"It's as if they had tried to stop us in the old days by burning theKreisleitung,\" said the Kreisleiter.\"By golly, boss, you're right,\" said Damm. \"I hadn't thought of it that way.It's Blodsznn.\"\"We have to cover the county,\" said the Kreisleiter, as they pulled up in frontof the Kreisleitung in Spelle. \"The Gauleiter's adjutant called. Order fromReichsmarshal Goring. It's everywhere, all over Germany. It must be stopped atonce. Whoever lays a hand on Vollcsgut must be punished.\" Damm glanced at theKreisleiter when heTen Mensaid Volfcsgut—the \"German People's property\"—and said nothing.It was almost dawn when they got back to Kronenberg.\"Where to, boss?\" said Damm.\"Home/ 7 said the Kreisleiter.As he got back into bed, Damm's wife said to him, \"What do you think, Heinrich?\"\"Blodsinn,\" said Damm, one of the \"March violets\" who flocked into the Party in1933. \"It's as if they had tried to stop us in the old days by burning theKreisleitung.\"5. Horsfrnar Rupprecht, high-school student, age 14The crash—of the synagogue dome—that awakened Heinrich Damm awakened theRupprechts on Klinggasse, three blocks from the fire. They saw the sparks fromthe second-floor window of their house and went up through the hatch to theroof. There they could see the glowing half-dome. Horsfs mother held his hand;he hated having his hand held.\"Papa,\" said his mother to his father, \"It's the synagogue.\"The father said nothing.\"Of course it's the synagogue,\" said Horst, excited. \"Juda verrecke/ May theJews drop dead!\"\"Come down,\" said his father.\"Golly, not yet, Pa.\"His father opened the hatch.\"Can I go to the fire, Pa? They'll all be there. Can I?\"The family—Horst was an only child and the only member of either his father's ormother's family who had ever gone to high school instead of to trade school—wentdown the hatchway to the attic. It was pitch dark, and Horst, hismother still holding on to his hand, heard his father stop instead of openingthe door to the stairs.\"They'll all be there, Pa. Can I?\"'They won't all be there, Horstmar. You won't be there/'That was a long speech for Emil Rupprecht A long speech, and it meant that alonger speech would follow. Horst's hand stopped wriggling in his mother's.''Where did you learn to say 'Juda verrecfce'?\" said his father.\"In the Ha-/ot, the Hitler Youth,\" said Horst.\"So/' said his father, \"in the Ha-Jot.\"\"They don't teach it, Pa, you just hear it there. The other kids say it. Theyall say it/'\"Like 'they'll all be there/ \" said his father.\"You just hear it, Pa, don't you understand?\"\"No/'Father, mother, and son stood there. At fourteen Horst couldn't stand what, whenhe was grown, he called his father's Schweigsamkeit, his taciturnity, any morethan he could stand what he later called his mother's Kadaverge-horsam, herunresisting obedience to her husband. Horst was one of those fourteen-year-oldswho can't stand things. And he was in the Ha-Jot\"Horstmar,\" said his father (he never called him \"Horst,\" and Horst couldn'tstand that, either), \"do you know what a synagogue is?\"\"Of course,\" said Horst.His father was silent.\"Tell Papa what it is, Son,\" said Frau Rupprecht, who was afraid of both herhusband and her son.\"It's the Jews'—the Jews'—church,\" said Horst.\"And a church?\" said his father. \"What is a church, Horstmar?\"Ten Men\"A house of God, Pa, golly.\"\"A house of God, without the Ta, golly/ \" said his father.\"Yes, Pa, a house of God/ 7\"God's house?\" said his father.\"Yes, Pa.\"\"And you, Horstmar, you want to go and see them burn God's house down?\"\"No, Pa, golly, you don't understand. You don't—are you for the Jews, Pa?\"Father, mother, and son stood there.\"No, of course not, Son, of course he's not,\" said Frau Rupprecht, who wasafraid of her husband, of her son, of God, and of Hitler.Emil Rupprecht opened the attic door, and the family went down and back to bed.But Horst was disturbed—and excited. In a way he felt sorry for his father, in away he had not felt before: a locomotive engineer all his life, at $144 a month,a little man with a little job and a little wife and a little house, a man whosaid nothing because, the fact was, he had nothing to say, a man who knewnothing of politics and the world and who claimed to be a Nazi. Horst had beeneight when his father joined the Party in the fall of '32; now he knew that hisfather was just a me-tooer.\"You want to go and see them burn God's house down?\" Men setting fire to housesat night. God's house. Horst's house, his father's house. Horst rolled around inhis sleep and awakened, afraid. Whenever Horst was afraid at night, he lookedinto his parents' room to see if they were there. Now he crept to the door andopened it. The light had begun. His mother was in bed, but his father wassitting in the rocking chair at the window. It was 5:15 in the morning.At 5:15 the Brotchen, the little breakfast rolls, had to be in the oven to beout with the boy before six. Baker Wedekind, behind his shop at the far west endof Hitler-Strasse, was at work in his slippers and trousers and apron (whichneeded changing), his suspenders over his quarter-sleeve heavy gray underwear.He got the Brotchen in and stepped to the front of the shop to open the door,have a look at the breaking light, and smoke his cigar. He had been thinking ofgoing down to his garden plot, at the edge of town, and turning it before it gotany colder, but the dawn looked like rain. He'd go tomorrow.As he stood there, two men whom he knew came by, from the direction ofFrankfurterplatz. \"What's up, at this hour?\" he said. They told him that thesynagogue had burned down in the night \"So/' he said, and went back to hisBrotchen. The synagogue.In 1933 Baker Wedekind had been Party manager for his block and, as he himselfput it, a flotter SA Mann, a jaunty Storm Trooper. One day he'd been sitting inthe Felsenkeller having a beer, when somebody threw a rock through the window ofthe Jew Mannheimer's shoestore. Wedekind rushed into the store and scooped upthe money from the cash register—just to protect it—and the police came. Thenext day the plainclothesman, old Hofmeister, called him in and said that someof the money was missing. That was taken care of by the Party, but there was arumor around town that Baumert, the Social Democrat Bolshevik, had taken asnapshot of the baker standing in front of the cash register with his hands fullof money. It was just a rumor, of course, but Wedekind quit the SA as soon as hehad a good excuse, when the Handicrafts and Trades Office31Ten Menof the Party in Kronenberg was opened and he was offered the thankless job ofmediator.As he took his rolls from the fire, Baker Wedekind thought that he would like tosee the Jew church burned down, but, on second thought, it might be better to goto the garden and work. No use looking for trouble; the shoe shop affair wasenough. He would go by tomorrow, ju$t walk past on his way to Frankfurterplatzand have a good look. That was the way to do it.So he finished the rolls and went upstairs to eat breakfast with his wife, whowas just as thick and strong as he was and did social work for the Party. Henever talked to his wife, or to his son, whose wife resented her husband's lowpay at the bakery, or to his daughter, who had got into trouble and could not begot rid of. The fact is that Baker Wedekind was not a jaunty man at all. He wasa baker, and he baked. Each month he looked through that month's Master-Balcer.Each day he read the headlines of the Daily Kronenberger. He had a copy of MeinKampf (who hadn't?), but he had never opened it (who had?).If he had been a profoundly reflective man, Baker Wedekind might have said tohimself, as he ate his breakfast: This life is work. The next—if only a man knewfor sure—will be different. In bad times, in this life, you work without reward.In good times, you work with reward. But in bad times and good, you work. Theseare good times. The regime?—the regime promised the people bread, and I bake thebread. The \"Thousand-Year Reich\"?-If it lasts a thousand years, fine; a hundredyears, fine; ten years, still fine.It was 6:15 A.M.Beginning to rain. Baker Wedekind went down to the garden anyway.7. Hans Simon, bill-collector, age 42Hans Simon got up at 6:15, as he always did, shaved, waxed his little mustache,had his breakfast, in the course of which he reviewed the world situation, as healways did, with his wife, his son, and his daughter as audience, and set out(banging the door behind him) for the municipal electric works to pick up hismorning calls. He bicycled firmly along, never swerving, preoccupied with theworld situation.He had a right to be. Cell Leader Simon—cell leader was the very lowest rank inthe Party—was one of the first Nazis in Germany and the first in Kronenberg.Sturmfiihrer Schwenke, the bankrupt tailor, always claimed to be the first. Healways talked about wir alte Kampfer, we Old Party Fighters, but he never gavehis Party Number and no one had ever seen his Gold Party Badge. Simon wore hisbadge on his jacket, where everyone saw it, and whenever it was the thirteenthof the month he walked under ladders and so on and said, 'Thirteen is nothingunlucky for me. My Party Number is 5813, the five thousand eight hundred andthirteenth German to join the Party, and I call that lucky. And, before that, amember of the Fiihrer's Freiheits-bewegung, the Freedom Movement, before theBloody Parade in Munich/'These reflections having taken Hans Simon across the Werne Bridge and intoFrankfurterplatz, he saw a fire truck a half-block down on the Mauerweg and asmall crowd held back by SA men. It was drizzling, but the bill-collectordecided to pedal to the scene; it might be something of great importance.The building was gone. The outer walls and part of the wooden dome, stillsmoking, were left. There was oneTen Menpoliceman present, in front of the gate of the iron fence around the lawn. Askinny old woman was talking in a cackle to whoever would listen: \"A church, achurch, a church/ 7 she kept saying. SA men answered her; no one else saidanything.\"A Jew church/' said one SA man.\"It's not even a church/' said another.\"Why don't you join, Auntie?\"\"Be a Jew girl/'\"A church, a church, a church/ 7 the old woman kept saying.Bill-collector Simon, Party Number 5813, Gold Party Badge, rode on in the rainto pick up his morning calls and pondered the world situation. It was 7:30 inthe morning.8. Johann Kessler, Labor Front inspector (formerly unemployed bank cleric), age46At 7:30 Inspektor Kessler got off the local train from Kummerfeld and walked tohis office in the Labor Front, in Hermann-Goring-Strasse. He got there at twentyto eight (he wasn't due until eight), and Picht came in and said, \"Have youheard? They burned the synagogue last night, here, everywhere. 77He and Picht picked up Euler on their way out, and the three men walked down theWerneweg to Frankfurterplatz and the Mauerweg in the drizzle. There it was,still smoking.None of them said anything until they reached the Werneweg on their way back tothe office. Then Kessler, a renegade Catholic who \"preached 77 in the Nazi FaithMovement, said:\"This is a change. A big change. 77\"Burning property/' said Picht, shaking his head, \"burning property, whetherit's a church or whatever.\"\"It won't make them love us abroad/' said Euler.\"Do they love us now?\" said Picht. Euler didn't reply.\"A big change/' said Kessler again, \"eine Evolution.\" Kessler liked to useflowery language.Ahead of them Pastor Tresckow of the Katherine Church was walking slowly awayfrom the scene of the fire, an old man who had always kept out of politics. \"DerPfarrer guclct auch, the pastor took a squint at it, too,\" said Euler. Just thenthere was a shout behind them:\"Nachstesinal die Katheiinenkirche! The Katherine Church next!\"Picht and Euler raised their eyes to each other, but Kessler, the renegadeCatholic, stopped sharply and looked back. People were hurrying to work on bothsides of the street, some of them under umbrellas. Nobody but Kessler hadstopped or raised his eyes. Pastor Tresckow was walking slowly on.9. Heinrich Hildebrandt, high-school teacher, age 34\"Herr Studienrat, Herr Studienrat!\" Studienrat Hildebrandt waited untilPfeffermann caught up with him. Pfef-fermann was a student at the universitynow, but he had been one of Hildebrandt's students in the classical high school.Pfeffermann liked and admired Hildebrandt. Even though Hildebrandt was a Nazi,and an ostentatious one, he was a highly cultivated man who really knewliterature and music, a true Continental. It was even said—no one knew—thatbefore coming to Kronenberg he had once been an anti-Nazi and owed his survivalto the personal influence of his father, an old Army colonel. How anxiousHildebrandt was to talk with Pfeffermann, who was a Mischling (hisTen Menfather was the Jew in the marriage, which made it worse), was another question,although the teacher certainly liked the student.\"Have you heard, Herr Studienrat? They have—the synagogue has been burned.\"'The synagogue?\"\"Yes.\"\"Have you been there?\"\"No. Have you time to go?\"Herr Hildebrandt had time this morning; his literature class were writing theirexamination, and he always made a point of arriving late on examination days toshow the students that he trusted them. He hesitated a moment, began to blush,and then said, \"Yes, I have time.\"It was 8:45 or so when they got there. The fire had almost burned itself out,but the smoke still came through the half-fallen dome of the building. The firetrucks, one on the Mauerweg, one up above on Hitler-Strasse, were no longerpumping. It was drizzling.\"The synagogue,\" said Pfeffermann, shaking his head,Hildebrandt, blushing, said nothing. The American, Henderson, a buoyant youngman who was studying (not very hard) at Kronenberg University and, throughPfeffermann, had met Hildebrandt before, came over to them; he said good morningwithout shaking hands (American fashion), and asked, in German, \"Was ist los,Herr Studienrat?\" Hildebrandt shook his head, without answering. He felt himselfblushing and, feeling himself blushing, blushed worse.As he entered his classroom, the class interrupted its writing to stand until hehad said good morning and sat down at his desk. He opened his briefcase and tookout Crime and Punishment, in French, with a plain wrapping-papercover over the binding, to read while the class continued their examination.Always fire, always fire. The Reichstag fire. The book-burning in theParadeplatz in Konigsberg. He was an anti-Nazi then, in '33, a man who read theBaseler Nachrichter and Le Temps every day and even once in a while (with greatdifficulty, for his English was weak) the Times of London. Now he was a Nazi,reading Crime and Punishment in French, with a plain wrapping-paper cover overthe binding. Now he was a Nazi, and the Nazis were burning synagogues.The noon bell rang. The students brought their examination books to the desk,and each said, \"Guten Morgen, Herr Studienrat,\" but the Studienrat, reading hisbook in the wrapping-paper cover, did not look up.10. Willy Hofmeister, policeman, age 57It was noon, and Plainclothesman Hofmeister of the Kronenberg detective bureauwas pedaling over the Werne Bridge on his way to work. Thursday was his morningto paint, but you can't paint in the rain. Hofmeister had chronic leadpoisoning; he was allowed to paint once a week, out of doors. His paintings, inoil, were, like Cabinetmaker Klingelhofer's, what a critic would call \"calendarart\" as far as subject, mood, and technique were concerned, but of their kindthey were skilled and delicate.Willy Hofmeister had had to give up his profession of scenery-painting when hewas twenty-eight. In 1908 he had become a policeman in Kronenberg, first in thetraffic police and then in the criminal division. It had not been a bad life. Inthirty years there had been only three killings in Kronenberg, only one of thema murder (the other two were sex-maniac cases). In three more years he wouldretireTen Menon full pension. Not bad; but Willy Hofmeister had wanted to paint.When his wife (who always made him stay in bed late and rest on Thursdays) toldhim that there was smoke coming up near Frankfurterplatz, Hofmeister knew rightaway what it was. The morning before, Oskar Rosenthal, the former Bank Director,had come to his office, stood with his hands at his side, and said, as Naziprotocol required, \"Ich bin der Jude, Oskar Israel Rosen—\"\"Bitte, bitte, please, please, Herr Direktor,\" Hofmeister said to the formerBank Director, \"sit down, won't you?\" When Rosenthal, the chairman of the boardof the Kronen-berg synagogue, told him that more windows had been broken thenight before and the janitor had reported a smell of gasoline, Hofmeister saidto the old man:\"A man will investigate at once, Herr Direktor, especially the gasoline smell.The windows—well, such things are difficult, you know, with, well, with theshooting in Paris yesterday/'\"I understand, Herr Kriminalinspektor,\" said Rosenthal.\"So,\" said Kriminalinspektor Hofmeister, rising, \"if you will excuse me amoment, I'll get the stenographer and you can dictate a report of the gasolinesmell and the windows, and then we will register the complaint.\"\"No, no, Herr Kriminalinspektor,\" said Rosenthal. \"I would rather not make areport, and there is certainly no complaint.\"\"But,\" said Hofmeister, \"a report must be made.\"\"No, really,\" said Rosenthal, rising, \"it is not at all necessary from our—frommy point of view. I would much prefer not to make a report.\"\"But there must be a report, Herr Direktor,\" said Hofmeister.\"Only if you insist, Herr Kriminalinspektor,\" said Rosen-thai.The old policeman twisted his immense white mustache and said, \"I shall make thereport myself, Herr Direktor, after we have investigated. All possible stepswill be taken/' He held out his hand to the former Bank Director and said,\"Bitte, Herr Direktor.\"The old Jew took his hand and said, \"Bitte, Herr Kriminalinspektor,\" and leftHofmeister had sent a policeman to the synagogue to investigate and, before hehimself left for home at the end of the day, he wrote the report and placed itin the Kronen-berg police files, which were found, incompletely burned, in thealley behind the police station when the American troops entered Kronenbergseven years later. The report, dated November 9, 1938, read:\"Synagogue, Mauerweg, report of broken windows, etc.\"Investigation at the scene established the fact that on the night of November8, seven windowpanes in the synagogue on the Mauerweg were broken by stonesthrown by unknown persons. Some of the stones lay in the prayer hall, some onthe lawn. On the southeast gable side of the building, just outside the windowleading to the furnace-room, which window was also found to have been broken,were the remnants of two wine bottles. These bottles had obviously been filledwith a liquid, the odor of which was still present on the glass particles and inthe immediate vicinity, corked with paper and rag bits, and ignited. Indicationspoint to an explosion of small extent, i.e., of limited effect. Damage to thebuilding, apart from a blackening on the wall, was not present.\"Criminologically valuable clues not present.Ten Men\"Search for perpetrators without result, as of 5:20 P.M. instant date.\"On the side of those whose interests were injured, there was no demand forinvestigation.\"That was the afternoon before, and now, as he pedaled over the Werne Bridge,Policeman Hofmeister was worried. The report had gone down to the chiefs of boththe traffic and criminal police before 6 P.M., and Hofmeister was sure thatthere must have been uniformed police guarding the building during the night.The SA—of course it was the SA —did not like the police, and the police despisedthe SA. So there must have been trouble. Hofmeister decided to go over to thesynagogue.There were SA men everywhere, and only one uniformed policeman, Baumann, of thetraffic division, in front of the synagogue gate. Hofmeister talked to him,Baumann answered, Hofmeister asked him something, and Baumann shrugged hisshoulders as he replied. Then Hofmeister walked away.\"Heil Hitler, Herr Kriminalinspektor!\"It was Schwenke, the Sturmfuhrer. \"Morgan,\" said Hofmeister, getting on hisbicycle. Schwenke, the Sturmfuhrer. In 1931 Hofmeister had been sent to searchSchwenke's apartment for evidence of illegal possession of arms by the SA, andSchwenke had said, \"You find nothing in my mail, Herr Kriminalinspektor; do youthink you will find something in my apartment?\" Schwenke, the Nazi. Now it wasHofmeister, the Nazi, Schwenke and Hofmeister. The old policeman had three yearsto go, and then his pension, and the doctor had said that if he wasn't workinghe could paint.At the office Hofmeister was told to report to the Police Chief, theOberinspektor.\"Herr Kriminalinspektor,\" said the Police Chief, a youngman, \"I have here an order to be executed. I will read it to you, and then Iwill ask you to read it yourself and sign it.\"\" 'And sign it/ Herr Oberinspektor?\" said Hofmeister.\"And sign it, Herr Kriminalinspektor.\"The order said that all male Jews in Kronenberg between the ages of eighteen andsixty-five were to be taken into protective custody at once. The order was to beexecuted before midnight of the instant date, November 10, 1938, by the CriminalPolice (who in Germany could always arrest without a warrant). KriminalinspektorHofmeister was to deliver the following persons, whose names began with Fthrough M, to the storerooms of the Town Hall, which would be used for custodybecause of the shortage of custodial quarters.\"Clear, Herr Kriminalinspektor?\"\"Yes, Herr Oberinspektor.\"\"You will remain on duty until all the persons on your list are in custody, andthen you will get your overtime off.\"\"Yes, Herr Oberinspektor.\"Policeman Hofmeister took his list and began his round, without his bicycle. Hecarried no weapon.It was a long afternoon. It might have been longer, except that every man on thelist was at home; no Jew in Kronenberg had gone out of his house since the nightbefore. Still, it was a long afternoon, and when Policeman Hofmeister rang theapartment bell alongside Salo Maro-witz's tailor-shop, it was going on nineo'clock.Marowitz opened the door and said, \"Come in, Herr Kriminalinspektor.\"\"Thank you, Herr Marowitz.\"On the parlor table, under the green glass tulip chan-Ten Mendelier, was a suitcase, closed. On the sofa were a man's coat and hat.\"Herr Marowitz-\"1 Won't you sit down, Herr Kriminalinspektor?\" «I_. Thank you, a moment only,Herr Marowitz.\" \"You have come for me, Herr Kriminalinspektor.\" \"Yes, HerrMarowitz. Just for your own protec—\" \"I understand, Herr Kriminalinspektor.Shall we go?\"\"Yes, if you don't mind Herr Marowitz, may I ask ifyou have blankets and food, and a little money?\"\"Money, yes, but not blankets. And my wife will bring me food if it'snecessary.\"\"Why don't you take a blanket, just to have one, and maybe some bread andsausage or something, Herr Marowitz? You understand, I don't—\"\"Thank you, Herr Kriminalinspektor Mama, come inand say good evening to Kriminalinspektor Hofmeister.\" \"No,\" from the otherroom.Tin sorry, Herr Kriminalinspektor. Frau Marowitz isn't so well this evening.I'll get the blanket and food.\"Hofmeister sat in the room alone, and the apartment door was unlocked from theoutside. Samuel, the tailor's 17-year-old Mischling son came in.\"Hello, Herr Kriminalinspektor. I saw Georg this afternoon, at the synagogue.They blew it up, as a safetymeasure.\"\"I know,\" said Hofmeister; Georg was his youngestson.\"You don't see something like that every day,\" said Samuel.\"No, you don't, Samuel,\" said Hofmeister. \"And Georg says he's sure I can get inthe Air Corps;they take half-Jews. He's going to speak to—hello, Pop, what's the blanket for,where you going?\"\"Hello, Schmul. I'm going to spend the night out.\"\"Where?\"\"At the Town Hall. Herr Hofmeister is going with me.\"\"Oh.\" The boy paused. \"Can I go along?\"\"Well-\"\"Oh, yes,\" said Hofmeister, \"part way, we'll all walk together.\"\"Well,\" said Marowitz, \"a glass of wine, Herr Kriminal-inspektor?\"\"No, thank you, Herr Marowitz, not on duty, you know. Maybe just a—. No. Thankyou anyway. I appreciate it.\"The son carrying the father's suitcase and walking between the two older men,the three of them climbed up through the streets, around the turns, up thesteps, to the Market Place which led to the Town Hall.\"We're traveling at a snail's pace,\" said the son.\"Herr Hofmeister and I are older than you are, Son, aren't we, HerrKriminalinspektor?\"\"Yes, Herr Marowitz,\" said Hofmeister, \"yes, we are.\" Then he stopped and said,\"I'm a little out of breath, if you don't mind, Herr Marowitz. I'm tiredtonight. If you and Samuel care to walk on ahead, I'll catch up with you.\"CHAP TER 2The Lives Men LeadThese ten men were \"little men\"; only Herr Hildebrandt, the teacher, had anysubstantial status in the community. And when I say \"little men/' I mean notonly the men for whom the mass media and the campaign speeches are everywheredesigned but, specifically in sharply stratified societies like Germany, the menwho think of themselves in that way. Every one of my ten Nazi friends—includingHildebrandt—spoke again and again during our discussions of \"wir fcleine Leute,we little people/'This self-consciousness is nonexistent—or repressed-—in America. Europeanstudents of our culture have all cited our egalitarianism as an affectation andan expensive one, producing a national leadership indistinguishable from itsconstituency. If everybody is little, nobody is little. But the rise of NationalSocialism involved both the elitist and the servile impulses. When \"big men/'Hindenburgs, Neu-raths, Schachts, and even Hohenzollerns, accepted Nazism,little men had good and sufficient reason to accept it. \"Wenn die '/a' sagen,\"said Herr Simon, the bill-collector, \"dann sagen wir auch '/a/ What was goodenough for them was certainly good enough for us/'Foreigners speaking of the \"National Socialist Party\" miss the point, said theyounger Schwenke; it was theNational Socialist German Workers Party, \"the party of the little men like me.The only other was the Communist/' Emperor and Fiihrer both required theconsciousness of littleness in the Germans, but Fiihrer, bringing bigness down,lifted littleness up. The democratic baby-kisser and backslapper does the samething, but it is more effective when an absolute ruler does it My friends werelittle men—like the Fiihrer himself.These ten men were not men of distinction. They were not men of influence. Theywere not opinion-makers. Nobody ever gave them a free sample of anything on theground that what they thought of it would increase the sales of the product.Their importance lay in the fact that God—as Lincoln said of the commonpeople—had made so many of them. In a nation of seventy million, they were thesixty-nine million plus. They were the Nazis, the little men to whom, if everthey voiced their own views outside their own circles, bigger men politelypretended to listen without ever asking them to elaborate.A year's conversations, in their own language, under informal conditionsinvolving meals, \"a glass of wine,\" or, more preciously, a cup of coffee,exchange of family visits (including the children), and long, easy evenings,Saturday afternoons, or Sunday walks—these were things that not one of my tenfriends had supposed possible with an American. None of them had had any butofficial American contacts. None had been to America or England or outsideGermany as civilians, excepting the teacher, who had spent much time in France.None spoke English.My relationships with them were, in every case, established with considerabledifficulty, through a third (or fourth or fifth) person who could convince themof my good faith and my good intentions. And all ten of them,The Lives Men Leadwith the possible exception of Baker Wedekind, seemed sooner or later to haveaccepted my statement of my mission: I had come to Germany, as aGerman-descended private person, to bring back to America the life-story of theordinary German under National Socialism, with the end purpose of establishingbetter understanding of Germany among my countrymen. The statement was true, andmy German academic position gave it weight with them. But my greatest asset wasmy total ignorance of German—the only language that any of them, except theteacher (who spoke French) could speak. They were my teachers. \"Mushi,\" the oldtailor, Schwenke, would call to his wife, \"just listen to the way the HerrProfessor says *Auf wieder-sehenf \" My friends had ample opportunity to displaytheir pedagogy and their patience with the Herr Professor, who was slow, butgood-natured.I did lie to all ten of them on two points: on the advice of my Germancolleagues and friends, I did not tell them that I was a Jew; nor did I tellthem that I had access to other sources of information about them than myprivate conversations with them.I think that I may now call all of them, with the exception of the baker,friends of mine. I think that four of the ten, Tailor Schwenke, his son Gustav,Bank Clerk Kessler, and Teacher Hildebrandt (and, possibly, PolicemanHof-meister) told me their stories as fully as the stories were in them to tell.They were none of them, except the teacher, the student, and the bank clerk, atall fluent by temperament, but none of the ten consciously lied to me (in myopinion) except, possibly, Baker Wedekind and Tailor Schwenke, and the latteronly on his role in the arson of the synagogue. I found no intolerablediscrepancies or contradictions in their individual accounts overmonths of discussion; memory lapse, normal reserve, and, above all, theconfusion and repression inherent in such cataclysmic experiences as theirsseemed to me to explain the small discrepancies and contradictions I observed.At no point did I try to trap any of them.Only one of my ten Nazi friends saw Nazism as we— you and I—saw it in anyrespect. This was Hildebrandt, the teacher. And even he then believed, and stillbelieves, in part of its program and practice, \"the democratic part.\" The othernine, decent, hard-working, ordinarily intelligent and honest men, did not knowbefore 1933 that Nazism was evil. They did not know between 1933 and 1945 thatit was evil. And they do not know it now. None of them ever knew, or now knows,Nazism as we knew and know it; and they lived under it, served it, and, indeed,made it.As we know Nazism, it was a naked, total tyranny which degraded its adherentsand enslaved its opponents and adherents alike; terrorism and terror in dailylife, private and public; brute personal and mob injustice at every level ofassociation; a flank attack upon God and a frontal attack upon the worth of thehuman person and the rights which that worth implies. These nine ordinaryGermans knew it absolutely otherwise, and they still know it otherwise. If ourview of National Socialism is a little simple, so is theirs. An autocracy? Yes,of course, an autocracy, as in the fabled days of \"the golden time\" our parentsknew. But a tyranny, as you Americans use the term? Nonsense.When I asked Herr Wedekind, the baker, why he had believed in NationalSocialism, he said, \"Because it promised to solve the unemployment problem. Andit did. But I never imagined what it would lead to. Nobody did.\"I thought I had struck pay dirt, and I said, \"What do you mean, 'what it wouldlead to/ Herr Wedekind?\"The Lives Men Lead'War/' he said. \"Nobody ever imagined it would lead to war.\"The evil of National Socialism began on September 1, 1939; and that was myfriend the baker.Remember—none of these nine Germans had ever traveled abroad (except in war);none had ever known or talked with a foreigner or read the foreign press; noneever wanted to listen to the foreign radio when it was legal to do so, and none(except, oddly enough, the policeman) listened to it when it was illegal. Theywere as uninterested in the outside world as their contemporaries in France— orAmerica. None of them ever heard anything bad about the Nazi regime except, asthey believed, from Germany's enemies, and Germany's enemies were theirs.\"Everything the Russians and the Americans said about us,\" said CabinetmakerKlingelhofer, \"they now say about each other.\"Men think first of the lives they lead and the things they see; and not, amongthe things they see, of the extraordinary sights, but of the sights which meetthem in their daily rounds. The lives of my nine friends—and even of the tenth,the teacher—were lightened and brightened by National Socialism as they knew it.And they look back at it now—nine of them, certainly—as the best time of theirlives; for what are men's lives? There were jobs and job security, summer campsfor the children and the Hitler Jugend to keep them off the streets. What does amother want to know? She wants to know where her children are, and with whom,and what they are doing. In those days she knew or thought she did; whatdifference does it make? So things went better at home, and when things gobetter at home, and on the job, what more does a husband and father want toknow?The best time of their lives. There were wonderful ten-dollar holiday trips for the family in the \"'Strength through Joy\" program, toNorway in the summer and Spain in the winter, for people who had never dreamedof a real holiday trip at home or abroad. And in Kronenberg \"nobody\" (nobody myfriends knew) went cold, nobody went hungry, nobody went ill and uncared for.For whom do men know? They know people of their own neighborhood, of their ownstation and occupation, of their own political (or nonpolitical) views, of theirown religion and race. All the blessings of the New Order, advertisedeverywhere, reached \"everybody.\"There were horrors, too, but these were advertised nowhere, reached \"nobody.\"Once in a while (and only once in a while) a single crusading orsensation-mongering newspaper in America exposes the inhuman conditions of thelocal county jail; but none of my friends had ever read such a newspaper whenthere were such in Germany (far fewer there than here), and now there were none.None of the horrors impinged upon the day-to-day lives of my ten friends or wasever called to their attention. There was \"some sort of trouble\" on the streetsof Kronenberg as one or another of my friends was passing by on a couple ofoccasions, but the police dispersed the crowd and there was nothing in the localpaper. You and I leave \"some sort of trouble on the streets\" to the police; sodid my friends in Kronenberg.The real lives that real people live in a real community have nothing to do withHitler and Roosevelt or with what Hitler and Roosevelt are doing. Man doesn'tmeet the State very often. On November 10, 1938, the day after the arson of thesynagogues, an American news service reported a trivial incident from a suburbof Berlin, A mob of children were carrying great sacks of candy out of theThe Lives Men Leadsmashed shop window of a Jewish-owned candy store, while a crowd of adults,including some of the children's parents (including, too, a ring of SA men inBrown Shirt uniform), stood watching. An old man walked up, an \"Aryan/ 7 Hewatched the proceedings and then turned to the parents and said to them: \"Youthink you are hurting the Jew. You do not know what you are doing. You areteaching your children to steal/ 7 And the old man walked off, and the parentsbroke out of the crowd, knocked the candy out of their children's hands anddragged them wailing away. Man, in the form of the parents, had met the State,in the form of the SA. But it is doubtful if he knew it; after all, the SA menjust stood there, without interfering.In its issue of November 11, 1938, the Kronenberger Zeitung carried thefollowing report, at the bottom of page 4, under a very small headline readingSchutzhaft, \"Protective Custody\": \"In the interest of their own security, anumber of male Jews were taken into custody yesterday. This morning they weresent away from the city/ 7 1 showed it to each of my ten friends. None of them—including the teacher—remembered ever having seen it or anything like it.1933, 1934,1935, 1936, 1937, 1938, 1939-until September 1, when, as the Head ofthe Government told them, Poland attacked their country—the little lives of myfriends went on, under National Socialism as they had before, altered only forthe better, and always for the better, in bread and butter, in housing, health,and hope, wherever the New Order touched them. \"No one outside Germany seems tounderstand this/ 7 said an anti-N^zi woman, who had been imprisoned in 1943,ostensibly for listening to the foreign radio but actually for hiding Jews(which was not technically illegal). \"I remember standing on a Stutt-gart street corner in 1938, during a Nazi festival, and the enthusiasm, the newhope of a good life, after so many years of hopelessness, the new belief, afterso many years of disillusion, almost swept me, too, off my feet. Let me try totell you what that time was like in Germany: I was sitting in a cinema with aJewish friend and her daughter of thirteen, while a Nazi parade went across thescreen, and the girl caught her mother's arm and whispered, 'Oh, Mother, Mother,if I weren't a Jew, I think I'd be a Nazi!' No one outside seems to understandhow this was/'The German language, like every other, has some glorious epithets,untranslatable, and wildgewordene Spiessbiir-ger is one of them. It means, veryroughly, \"little men gone wild/' Of themselves, such men would perhaps use theborrowed and Germanicized term Fanatffcer. Fanatilcer are not to be confusedeither with Spitzbuben, rascals, or with Bluthunde, hired hoodlums or goons.When I asked (of anti-Nazis and of Nazis) how many genuine Fanatilcer there werein the Third Reich, how many little men gone wild, the hazard was never over amillion. It must be remembered, especially in connection with Communism inRussia, and even with Fascism in Italy, that the National Socialist movementdied young; it never had a chance to rear a whole generation of its own.And the rest of the seventy million Germans? The rest were not even cogs, in anypositive sense at all, in the totalitarian machine. A people like ourselves, whoknow such systems only by hearsay or by the report of their victims oropponents, tends to exaggerate the actual relationship between man and the Stateunder tyranny. The laws are hateful to those who hate them, but who hates them?It is dangerous, in Nazi Germany, to go to Communist meetings or read theManchester Guardian, but whoThe Lives Men Leadwants to go to Communist meetings or read the Manchester Guardian?In the America of the 1950's one hears, on the one hand, that the country isovercome by mistrust, suspicion, and dread, and, on the other, that nobody isafraid, nobody defamed, nobody destroyed by defamation. Where is the truth?Where was it in Nazi Germany? None of my ten Nazi friends, with the exception ofthe cryptodemocrat Hildebrandt, knew any mistrust, suspicion, or dread in hisown life or among those with whom he lived and worked; none was defamed ordestroyed. Their world was the world of National Socialism; inside it, insidethe Nazi community, they knew only good-fellowship and the ordinary concerns ofordinary life. They feared the \"Bolsheviks\" but not one another, and their fearwas the accepted fear of the whole otherwise happy Nazi community that wasGermany. Outside that community they never went, or saw, or heard; they had nooccasion to.That Nazism in Germany meant mistrust, suspicion, dread, defamation, anddestruction we learned from those who brought us word of it—from its victims andopponents whose world was outside the Nazi community and from journalists andintellectuals, themselves non-Nazi or anti-Nazi, whose sympathies naturally laywith the victims and opponents. These people saw life in Germany in non-Naziterms. There were two truths, and they were not contradictory: the truth thatNazis were happy and the truth that anti-Nazis were unhappy. And in the Americaof the 1950's —I do not mean to suggest that the two situations are parallel oreven more than very tenuously comparable— those who did not dissent or associatewith dissenters saw no mistrust or suspicion beyond the great community'smistrust and suspicion of dissenters, while those who dis-sented or believed in the right to dissent saw nothing but mistrust andsuspicion and felt its devastation. As there were two Americas, so, in a muchmore sharply drawn division, there were two Germanys. And so, just as there iswhen one man dreads the policeman on the beat and another waves \"Hello\" to him,there are two countries in every country.In Russian-Communized East Germany after the second World War, a worker in aState factory is compelled to attend one meeting a week, of two hours, forpurposes of what we should call \"indoctrination\" or \"brain-washing\" and what theCommunists call \"education.\" Beyond that and paying his taxes, he is compelledto do nothing more; he takes military service, secret police, and rationing forgranted (as who doesn't?). Of course, he is blared at, from posters, newspapers,radio, and public address systems (as who isn't, for one purpose or another?),but he is let alone.Most Germans—nearly all of them, after twelve years of Nazism—see nothinginordinate in this amount of compulsion. Even under Nazism (before the war),Party members were required to give only Friday evenings and Sunday mornings toParty or public work. Beyond this point, service to the tyranny was, naturally,highly advisable for the ambitious and the politically suspect, but it was notrequired of the man who wanted to hold a job, a home, a family, and an honoredplace in the Singverein or the Turnverein. I encountered a few civil servants inKronen-berg who had never joined the Party and had not been bothered; they werethe kind that never joined anything, and nobody expected them to—the kind, too,that is never promoted; and I met a pastor who had not been persecuted althoughhe had refused to let his children join the HitlerThe Lives Men LeadYouth and the German Maidens until membership became automatic.It is local conditions, even under totalitarianism, which govern the applicationof public authority to the individual. These conditions, which vary so muchelsewhere, varied much more than I had supposed possible under NationalSocialism and tended almost always to relax the central controls (just as localcourts everywhere tend to relax legal principles), except where the local bosswas a Fanatiker. And these latter instances were the exceptions; local bosses,in order to function effectively, have to be locally popular.Pastor Wilhelm Mensching, in the village of Petzen, in Lower Saxony, preachedanti-Nazism to his little flock during the whole twelve years that the Naziswere in power in Germany. Every Sunday morning he stood in his pulpit andanswered the speech which the Biirgermeister, an \"Old Party Fighter/' made everySaturday night in the Market Place. Mensching was never touched; when theGestapo came from Hannover to arrest him, the Biirgermeister went to theGauleiter to oppose them, and the arrest wasn't made. Wilhelm Mensching had\"always\" been pastor of Petzen, and to disturb him would have been anintolerable disturbance to the configuration of the village. And both he and theBiirgermeister knew it.There were not enough thousands of Menschings in Germany, simply because suchmen are not born every day and the church in Germany (as elsewhere) does notnourish their multiplication. But there were dozens enough of them to make thepoint. To be sure, National Socialism had only a few years to achieve its greatGleichschaltung, its integration of man into the State; still, six of them werewar years, in which the tempo could be, and was, steppedup considerably. But modern tyrants all stand above politics and, in doing so,demonstrate that they are all master politicians. They know, without having toread Florentine theorists, that politicians cannot afford to be hated. ANiemoller would have to be silenced, at whatever risk to the tyranny; thebest-known of all German pastors, he had said, \"God is my Fiihrer.\" He was anational and an international challenge, and he had to be handled the hard way.But there were easy ways (the easiest being to ignore them) to confine theeffectiveness of dozens of Menschings to their separate villages without takingsteps which would have rocked any good villager on his heels and made him say,\"No, not this, not this/'Ordinary people—and ordinary Germans—cannot be expected to tolerate activitieswhich outrage the ordinary sense of ordinary decency unless the victims are, inadvance, successfully stigmatized as enemies of the people, of the nation, therace, the religion. Or, if they are not enemies (that comes later), they must bean element within the community somehow extrinsic to the common bond, ade-compositive ferment (be it only by the way they part their hair or tie theirnecktie) in the uniformity which is everywhere the condition of common quiet.The Germans' innocuous acceptance and practice of social anti-Semitism beforeHitlerism had undermined the resistance of their ordinary decency to thestigmatization and persecution to come.In the pleasant resort towns of New England Americans have seen signs reading\"Selected Clientele\" or \"Restricted.\" They have grown accustomed to seeing suchsigns, so accustomed that, unless they are non-Caucasian or, perhaps,non-\"Aryan\" Americans, they take no notice of them and, in taking no notice,accept them. In the much less pleasant cottonseed-oil towns of the Deep SouthAmericansThe Lives Men Leadhave grown accustomed to seeing signs reading anything from \"White\" and\"Colored\" to \"Nigger, Don't Let the Sun Set on You Here/' and, unless they arenon-Caucasian or, perhaps, northern Americans, they take no notice of them.There were enough such signs (literally and figuratively) in pre-Nazi Germany,and there was enough non-resistance to them, so that, when the countrysidebloomed in 1933 with signs reading \"Juden hier unerwiinscht, Jews Not WantedHere/' the Germans took no notice of them. So, in the body politic as in thebody personal, nonresis-tance to the milder indulgences paves the way fornonresis-tance to the deadlier.It is actual resistance which worries tyrants, not lack of the few handsrequired to do the dark work of tyranny. What the Nazis had to gauge was thepoint at which atrocity would awaken the community to the consciousness of itsmoral habits. This point may be moved forward as the national emergency, or coldwar, is moved forward, and still further forward in hot war. But it remains thepoint which the tyrant must always approach and never pass. If his calculationis too far behind the people's temper, he faces a palace Putsch; if it is toofar ahead, a popular revolution.It is in this nonlitigable sense, at least, that the Germans as a whole wereguilty: nothing was done, or attempted, that they would not stand for. The twoexceptions were euthanasia, which was abandoned, and the pagan \"Faith Movement\"of Alfred Rosenberg, which was aborted.Local hoodlums could beat up Communists or Social Democrats, desecrate Jewishcemeteries or smash Jews' windows by night; the local police, overseen by theGestapo, would make a routine and invariably unsuccessful investigation of theassault; and the ordinary demands ofdecency would be satisfied. The Kronenbergers, being decent folk, would,perhaps, turn over in their beds—and sleep on.The burning of a synagogue was something else; it approached, closely and almostdangerously, the point at which the community might be awakened. If notsacrilege, it was, after all, lawless destruction of valuable goods, an affrontto the German property sense (much deeper than ours) and, no less, to theresponsibility (much sterner than ours) of the authorities to uphold the law.When the synagogue was burned in Kronenberg, local SA men (including TailorSchwenke, my friend) were used incidentally; but the arson was planned anddirected by outsiders, from a big city forty miles away. In the pattern ofAmerican gangsterism's importation of killers from New York to Chicago or viceversa, the local officials were helpless and, by transference, the community,too.The German community—the rest of the seventy million Germans, apart from themillion or so who operated the whole machinery of Nazism—had nothing to doexcept not to interfere. Absolutely nothing was expected of them except to go onas they had, paying their taxes, reading their local paper, and listening to theradio. Everybody attended local celebrations of national occasions—hadn't theschools and the stores always been closed for the Kaiser's birthday?—so youattended, too. Everybody contributed money and time to worthy purposes, so youdid, too. In America your wife collects or distributes clothing, gives anafternoon a week to the Red Cross or the orphanage or the hospital; in Germanyshe did the same thing in the Nazi Frauenbund, and for the same reasons. TheFrauen-bund, like the Red Cross, was patriotic and humanitarian;The Lives Men Leaddid your wife ask the Red Cross if \"Negro\" plasma was segregated from \"white\"?One minded one's own business in Germany, with or without a dictatorship. Therandom leisure which leads Americans into all sorts of afterhour byways,constructive, amusing, or ruinous, did not exist for most Germans. One didn't goout of one's way, on a day off, to \"look for trouble\"—there less than here.Germans were no more given to associating with nonconformist persons ororganizations than we are. They engaged themselves in opposing the governmentmuch less than we do. Few Americans say \"No\" to the government—fewer Germans.None of my ten friends said \"No\" to the Nazi government, and only one of them,Teacher Hildebrandt, thought \"No.\"Men who are ever going to say \"No\" to the government are for the most part—notuniformly—men with a prior pattern of politically conscious impulse. But suchmen were, in Hitler's Germany, either Nazis or anti-Nazis. If they were Nazis,they said \"Yes,\" with a will. If they were anti-Nazis, their past record, likethe teacher's, hung over their heads. Far from protesting, these, the onlyGermans who might have protested in quantity, had the greatest incentive of allto conform. They were like men who, in McCarthy-ridden America, had beenCommunists in their youth, who hoped that their past was safely buried, andwhose sole concern was whether or not their names turned up in the day'sun-American activities testimony. Of all Americans, they would be the leastlikely to participate now in protest or opposition. \"I never got over marvelingthat I survived,\" said Herr Hildebrandt. \"I couldn't help being glad, whensomething happened to somebody else, that it hadn't happened to me. It was likelater on, when a bomb hit another city, or another house than your own;you were thankful/' \"More thankful for yourself than you were sorry for others?\"\"Yes. The truth is. Yes. It may be different in your case, Herr Professor, butI'm not sure that you will know until you have faced it.\"You were sorry for the Jews, who had to identify themselves, every male with\"Israel\" inserted into his name, every female with \"Sarah,\" on every officialoccasion; sorrier, later on, that they lost their jobs and their homes and hadto report themselves to the police; sorrier still that they had to leave theirhomeland, that they had to be taken to concentration camps and enslaved andkilled. But—weren't you glad you weren't a Jew? You were sorry, and moreterrified, when it happened, as it did, to thousands, to hundreds of thousands,of non-Jews. But—weren't you glad that it hadn't happened to you, a non-Jew? Itmight not have been the loftiest type of gladness, but you hugged it to yourselfand watched your step, more cautiously than ever.Those who came back from Buchenwald in the early years had promised—as everyinmate of every German prison had always had to promise upon his release—not todiscuss his prison experience. You should have broken your promise. You shouldhave told your countrymen about it; you might, though the chances were allagainst you, have saved your country had you done so. But you didn't. You toldyour wife, or your father, and swore them to secrecy. And so, although millionsguessed, only thousands knew. Did you want to go back to Buchenwald, and toworse treatment this time? Weren't you sorry for those who were left there? Andweren't you glad you were out?\"So war die Sache. That's the way it was.\" Where the community feels andthinks—or at least talks and acts-pretty much one way, to say or do differentlymeans a kind of internal exile that most people find unattractive to un-The Lives Men Leaddertake, even if it involves no legal penalty. Oh, it isn't so bad if you havebeen a lifelong dissenter or radical, or a known criminal; you're used to it.But you—you and I— you're used to saying \"Hello\" to everyone and having everyonesay \"Hello\" to you. You look every man in the eye, and, though your eyes may beempty, they are clear. You are respected in the community. Why? Because yourattitudes are the same as the community's. But are the community's attitudesrespectable? That's not the point.We—you and I—want the community's approval on the community's basis. We don'twant the approval of criminals, but the community decides what is criminal andwhat isn't. This is the trap. You and I—and my ten Nazi friends —are in thetrap. It has nothing to do directly with fear for one's own or his family'ssafety, or his job, or his property. I may have all these, never lose them, andstill be in exile. Somebody somewhere in the community (it doesn't matter who orwhy) is telling somebody else that I'm a liar or a cheater—or a Red. Tomorrowsomebody whose closer acquaintance I should never have cultivated—I have neverliked him, never really respected him—will pass me without saying \"Hello\" to me.I am being exiled at home, isolated. My safety, unless I am accustomed to beinga dissenter, or a recluse, or a snob, is in numbers; this man, who will pass metomorrow and who, though he always said \"Hello\" to me, would never have lifted afinger for me, will tomorrow reduce my safety by the number of one.In what you and I call the blessings of life—including uncritical acceptance bythe whole of the undifferentiated community—every one of my ten friends,excepting Tailor Schwenke, who had once had his own shop and was now a schooljanitor, was better off than he had ever been before; and not just they andtheir families, but all their friends, the\"whole\" community, the widows and orphans, the aged, the sick, and the poor.Germany had been what many Americans would call a welfare state ever sinceBismarck, the reactionary Junker, introduced social legislation to stave offsocial democracy. In the collapse after the first World War, and again in thecollapse at the end of the 1920's, the Weimar Republic could not maintain itssocial services. Nazism not only restored but extended them; they were much morecomprehensive than they had ever been before or, of course, than they have beensince. Nor were they restricted to Party members; only \"enemies\" of the regimewere excluded from them.The war was hard, although not, until the bombing became general, anywhere nearas hard as the first war, in which the German government had not anticipated theblockade and the civilian population ate acorns; this time, the conqueredcountries were starved and the Germans were fed. But my friends do not mean1939-45 when they speak of \"the Nazi time/ 7 They mean 1933-39. And the besttime of one's life is, in retrospect, all the better when, as in Germany after1945, one supposed that he would not see its like again.The best time of their lives.\"Yes,\" said Herr Klingelhofer, the cabinetmaker, \"it was the best time. Afterthe first war, German families began to have only two children. That was bad,bad for the family, the marriage, the home, the nation. There is where Germanywas dying, and that was the kind of strength we believed that Hitler was talkingabout Arid he was talking about it. After 33 we had more children. A man saw afuture. The difference between rich and poor grew smaller, one saw iteverywhere. A man had a chance. In 1935 I tookThe Lives Men Leadover my father's shop and got a two-thousand-dollar government loan. UngeheuerJUnheard of!\"The good development had nothing to do with whether we had a democracy, or adictatorship, or what. The form of government had nothing to do with it. A manhad a little money, a chance, and he didn't pay any attention to any system.Inside the system, you see the benefits. Outside it, when you are not benefitedby it, you see the faults, I suppose. I suppose that's the way it is in Russianow. That's the way it is everywhere, always, nicht wahr? 'Das danken wir unsermFiihrer. For all this we thank our Leader,' the kids all said in school. Nowthey say, 'Das danken wir den Amerikanern.' If Communism comes, they'll say,'Das danken wir dem Stalin/ That's the way men are. I couldn't do that myself.\"But he did it.Herr Klingelhofer counted his blessings. Who doesn't?This might be, I suppose, pro-Nazi propaganda. It is also a fact, in so far asmen's attitudes are facts and decisive facts. No Occupation could make—or hadmade—anti-Nazis out of my friends. The evidence they had before their eyes forrejecting that period of their lives that was spent under National Socialism waswholly inadequate. And it was hard to see how any \"recovery\" under any Germangovernment in any foreseeable future (still less, under any Occupation) couldmake it adequate. At best, until such time as men (or at least these men)changed the root basis of their values, \"things\" could only some day be as\"good\" as they had been under Hitler. What we call freedom is not, even if theyhad all the freedom we have, an adequate substitute, in my friends' view, forall that they had and have lost. Men who did not know that they were slaves donot know that they have been freed.CHAPTER 3Hitler and INone of these nine ordinary Germans (and even the tenth, Herr Hildebrandt, isnot completely firm on the point) thought then or thinks now that the rights ofman, in his own case, were violated or even more than mildly inhibited forreasons of what they then accepted (and still accept) as the national emergencyproclaimed four weeks after Hitler took office as Chancellor. Only two of theten—Hildebrandt, of course, and Simon, the bill-collector—saw the system as inany way repressive. Herr Simon thinks that it was because of what he calls his\"democratic\" tendency to argue that he rose only to the lowest rank in theParty, cell leader, in spite of his having been one of the oldest members of theParty in Germany. But he was never alienated from his Party faith or itsleadership by what he still regards as the local perversions of its principlesby \"the little Hitlers.\"\"The little Hitlers\" recurred constantly in my conversations with my friends. Itdid not derogate Hitler—quite the opposite. \"The little Hitlers\" were the localor provincial officials, fellows you knew or had heard other fellows talk aboutfamiliarly. You knew (or had reason to believe) that they were no bigger orbetter than you were; you detested their imitation of the Fiihrer, above all, ofhis certainty and the absoluteness that springs from certainty. But, because ofthe old military principle of command which obtainedHitler and Ithroughout the Party, you could do nothing about it but dream at night thatSchmidt, the little Hitler, had fallen on his face in public and you were chosenby acclaim to replace him.None of my ten friends, even today, ascribes moral evil to Hitler, although mostof them think (after the fact) that he made fatal strategical mistakes whicheven they themselves might have made at the time. His worst mistake was hisselection of advisers—a backhanded tribute to the Leader's virtues oftrustfulness and loyalty, to his very innocence of the knowledge of evil, fullyfamiliar to those who have heard partisans of F. D. R. or Ike explain how thingswent wrong.Having fixed our faith in a father-figure—or in a father, or in a mother or awife—we must keep it fixed until inexcusable fault (and what fault of a father,a mother, a wife, is inexcusable?) crushes it at once and completely. Thisfigure represents our own best selves; it is what we ourselves want to be and,through identification, are. To abandon it for anything less than crushingevidence of inexcusable fault is self-incrimination, and of one's best,unrealized self. Thus Hitler was betrayed by his subordinates, and the littleNazis with him. They may hate Bormann and Goebbels—Bormann because he rose topower at the end, and they are ashamed of the end; Goebbels because he was arunt with a \"Jewish mind,\" that is, a facile and cunning mind unlike theirs.They may hate Himmler, the Bluthund, above all, because he killed in cold blood,and they wouldn't do that. But they may not hate Hitler or themselves.\"You see,\" said Tailor Schwenke, the littlest of my ten little men, \"there wasalways a secret war against Hitler in the regime. They fought him with unfairmeans. HimmlerI detested. Goebbels, too. If Hitler had been told the truth, things would havebeen different\" For \"Hitler\" read \"I.\"\"The killing of the Jews?\" said the \"democratic\" bill-collector, der alteKampfer, Simon. \"Yes, that was wrong, unless they committed treason in wartime.And of course they did. If I had been a Jew, I would have myself. Still, it waswrong, but some say it happened and some say it didn't. You can show me picturesof skulls or shoes, but that doesn't prove it. But I'll tell you this—it wasHimmler. Hitler had nothing to do with it.\"\"Do you think he knew about it?\"\"I don't know. We'll never know now.\"Hitler died to save my friend's best self.Apart from the partially and secretly anti-Nazi teacher, only the bank clerk,Kessler, the natively eloquent little man who became an official Party speakerin the county, seems to have had any shadow of doubt about Hitler's personal orpublic goodness—and even he may be projecting his own experience: \"Hitler was aspellbinder, a natural orator. I think he was carried away from truth, even fromtruth, by his passion. Even so, he always believed what he said.\" \"The schemers,Himmler, Goebbels, Rosenberg, Bormann—they built him up into a man of destiny/'said Salesman Damm, the Party office manager in Kronenberg. \"They did it soskilfully that he finally believed it himself. From then on, he lived in a worldof delusion. And this happened, mind you, to a man who was good and great.\" Itcould happen to me, Heinrich Damm, too.These believers (for believers they certainly were) do not seem to have beenworshipers any more than we believers in F. D. R. or Ike are—if anything, lessso. Hitler was a man, one like ourselves, a little man, who, by doing whatHitler and Ihe did, was a testament to the democracy \"you Americans\" talk about, the abilityof us little men to become great and to rule the whole world. A little man, liteourselves. Such a man is the modern pattern of the demagogical tyrant, \"thepeople's friend\" of Plato's mob democracy. These Hitlers, Stalins, Mussolinisare commoner upstarts, the half-literate Hitler the commonest of the lot.Kings and kaisers rule by God's grace, Hitlers by their own. God's grace puts afather over his children, to rule them in their interest. He is visibly andincontrovertibly endowed with wisdom appropriate to his function, and hiswalking stick (or his napkin ring or his rocking chair), like the Kaiser'scrown, sets him wholly apart from his children. But these Hitlers wear trenchcoats. Are they in fact father-figures? Or are Leader and Father two separablesubconscious entities?The newest wrinkle in psychoanalytic lingo is \"charismatic leader.\" It seems tomean (if \"charismatic\" is derived from the Greek charisma) the one to whom it isgiven to take care of his people. Both the Kaiser and Hitler \"took care of\" theGerman people, but the Kaiser was endowed by God. He did not have to kissbabies; he did not have to do anything. The most perfect of fathers, he livedfar away, in Potsdam; you might see him once or twice in your life, in a greatparade, or never at all. Unlike your own biological father, he never punishedyou for little things or unjustly. Unlike your biological father, he let you be\"bad,\" in your personal life, beat your wife or get drunk or do shoddy work,without ever whipping you or withdrawing his love.Seven of my friends (the seven oldest of them) had been brought up in a stablesociety, with their perfect father in Potsdam and their imperfect father athome. One of theseven, Herr Kessler, the bank clerk, had been orphaned early and was brought upby his mother. At least four of the other six feared or hated their fathers (orboth), and of Hildebrandt alone am I able to say with some certainty that heneither feared nor hated his.The old tailor, Schwenke, still hates his father, who is still alive, atninety-three, in a near-by village; Schwenke has not seen him in years. He hatedhim always in his heart— \"he drank too much/ 7 'lie was cruel to my blessedmother\" —and finally he hated him openly, running away from home to the armyafter his father ordered him to remain in the service of a master-tailor whomistreated him. Heinrich Damm, the country boy, feared his father, who, besidesbeing an ambitious and avaricious farmer, was the village innkeeper and, after abackbreaking day in the fields, could handle any half-dozen sots who tried tokeep him from closing the inn at midnight. Damm remembers that his fathercompelled his pregnant mother to pile rocks until she dropped; when she died, afew years later, his father said, \"I guess I worked her too hard/' But the sonfeared his father too much (and still does) to hate him.By contrast, the five of my friends who now have children in or approachingtheir teens all marvel at the sassiness, the independence, of their ownchildren. And \"marvel\" better describes their attitude than \"disapprove\" or\"resent.\" The younger Schwenke said, \"My father\"—the old tailor— \"would havekilled me if I'd talked to him the way my boy talks to me,\" and he shakes hishead. \"It's all different now,\" said Cabinetmaker Klingelhofer. \"When I was aboy, I spoke when I was spoken to; otherwise, never. Now my children disagreewith me about everything, and I can't do a thing. My wife is the boss,\" and helaughs. The clue toHitler and Ithe change (and a radical change it seems to be) may be the emancipation of theGerman woman and, in particular, of the wife, which Nazism tried to overcome.The German child, today as yesterday, seems to be left almost entirely to themother; even among my non-Nazi friends, the relationship between father andchild was generally much more remote than ours. But, whereas the mother onceexecuted the father's will upon the child, she now seems to execute her own.My friends' youngsters are, to be sure, being brought up in a disintegratedsociety, in which not only the Kaiser but also the biological father have beendislodged. My friends have lost their jobs or their homes or their status ortheir security, and their children know it. And the Kaiser is only a characterin history, gone without any supposition that he will ever return.The true father-figure is a true figure, the representation of an ideal essence.Whether Wilhelm II was, as a ruler or a man, good or bad was irrelevant to hisstatus. The failings of one's biological father could not but affect one'sattitude, but the failings of the true father-figure were, like the Emperor'snew clothes in the fairy tale, beyond the very presumption of his subjects toobserve. There were, in Germany, daring intellectuals who attacked the Kaiser'spolicies before the first World War, but my friends were not daringintellectuals.One does not presume to judge the true father-figure. One would not—but cannothelp himself—judge his biological father. But one judges a man like himself byhis own criteria of success and failure. Hitler was, until 1943 or 1944, asuccess. He displayed all the way to Stalingrad a genius which only a dozen menin the whole world's history have had, a genius for continuous success in publicaffairsagainst the odds which only public affairs present. None of my friendshesitates—every soldier is a military expert, and every German is a soldier—tosay that he was wrong to invade Poland (or to invade when he did or how he did)or, perhaps, to attack Russia, which he had so brilliantly immobilized, or toally himself with Italy or to take on the world so soon. But these wrongs werestrategic mistakes. I might—my friends are talking—have made them myself.Napoleon made them.My friends do not mourn Hitler any more than we mourn those of our own nationalleaders whose genius culminates in ruin; such geniuses must build their ownsarcophagi with the cynical assistance of the political party hacks who findthemselves with bare bones on their hands in the next campaign. My Nazi friendsdo not deify Hitler or (if the distinction may be made) glorify him. They neverquestioned his absolute right or absolute power to absolute rule. But they donot think of him—and seem never to have done so—as Fiihrer, the Leader, and notjust because the Occupation's re-educators suppressed the use of the very word.They think of him as Hitler, and, whatever they dream of reviving, they do notdream of reviving Hitlerism.Romantic they are, but this romantic they are not. They do not repress his name;they mention it when there is occasion to mention it. But there is littleoccasion to do so. Old soldiers in Germany have something else to do these daysbesides spit on the stove and tell stories; the stove is cold. Nothing surprisedmy friends so much as to hear that Americans still speculate about Hitler'ssurvival, in the flesh in Argentina or Spain or in personal spirit in Germany.He lived, succeeded, failed, died, and is dead.Adolf Hitler was good for Germany—in my friends' view —up until 1943, 1941, or1939, depending upon the indi-Hitler and Ividual's assessment of his strategy. After that—you have only to look atGermany, \"at us, Herr Professor/ 7 to see that he was bad for Germany. Hitlerbelongs to the ages; what he left behind him belongs to my friends, who arescrabbling in the ruins. The distant future may revive him, but I think not; thedistant future is not likely to leave Germany as it was or is.CHAP TER 4\"What Would You Have Done?\"None of my ten friends ever encountered anybody connected with the operation ofthe deportation system or the concentration camps. None of them ever knew, on apersonal basis, anybody connected with the Gestapo, the Sicherheitsdienst(Security Service), or the Einsatzgruppen (the Occupation Detachments, whichfollowed the German armies eastward to conduct the mass killing of Jews). Noneof them ever knew anybody who knew anybody connected with these agencies ofatrocity. Even Policeman Hofmeister, who had to arrest Jews for \"protectivecustody\" or \"resettlement\" and who saw nothing wrong in \"giving the Jews land,where they could learn to work with their hands instead of with money,\" neverknew anyone whose shame or shamelessness might have reproached him had theystood face to face. The fact that the Police Chief of Kronenberg made him signthe orders to arrest Jews told him only that the Chief himself was afraid ofgetting into trouble \"higher up.\"Sixty days before the end of the war, Teacher Hilde-brandt, as a firstlieutenant in command of a disintegrating Army subpost, was informed by the postdoctor that an SS man attached to the post was going crazy because of hismemories of shooting down Jews \"in the East\"; this was the closest any of myfriends came to knowing of the systematic butchery of National Socialism.\"What Would You Have Done?\"I say none of these ten men knew; and, if none of them, very few of the seventymillion Germans. The proportion, which was none out of ten in Kronenberg, would,certainly, have been higher among more intelligent, or among more sensitive orsophisticated people in, say, Kronenberg University or in the big cities wherepeople circulate more widely and hear more. But I must say what I mean by\"know.\"By know I mean knowledge, binding knowledge. Men who are going to protest ortake even stronger forms of action, in a dictatorship more so than in ademocracy, want to be sure. When they are sure, they still may not take any formof action (in my ten friends' cases, they would not have, I think); but that isanother point. What you hear of individual instances, second- or thirdhand, whatyou guess as to general conditions, having put half-a-dozen instances together,what someone tells you he believes is the case— these may, all together, beconvincing. You may be \"morally certain,\" satisfied in your own mind. But moralcertainty and mental satisfaction are less than binding knowledge. What you andyour neighbors don't expect you to know, your neighbors do not expect you to acton, in matters of this sort, and neither do you.Men who participated in the operation of the atrocity system—would they orwouldn't they tell their wives? The odds are even in Germany, where husbandsdon't bother to tell their wives as much as we tell ours. But their wives wouldnot tell other people, and neither would they; their jobs were, to put itmildly, of a confidential character. In such work, men, if they talk, lose theirjobs. Under Nazism they lost more than their jobs. I am not saying that the menin question, the men who had firsthand knowledge, opposed the system in anydegree or even resented havingto play a role in it; I am saying, in the words of Cabinetmaker Klingelhofer,that that is the way men are; and the more reprehensible the work in which theyare voluntarily or involuntarily engaged, the more that way they are.I pushed this point with Tailor Marowitz in Kronenberg, the one Jew still therewho had come back from Buchen-wald. On his release, in 1939, he was forbidden totalk of his experience, and, in case he might become thoughtless, he wascompelled to report (simply report) to the police every day. Whom did he tell ofhis Buchenwald experience? His wife and \"a couple of my very closestfriends-Jews, of course.\"\"How widely was the whole thing known in Kronenberg by the end of the war?\"\"You mean the rumors?\"\"No—how widely was the whole thing, or anything, known?\"\"Oh. Widely, very widely.\"\"How?\"\"Oh, things seeped through somehow, always quietly, always indirectly. So peopleheard rumors, and the rest they could guess. Of course, most people did notbelieve the stories of Jews or other opponents of the regime. It was naturallythought that such persons would all exaggerate.\"Rumors, guesses enough to make a man know if he wanted badly to know, or atleast to believe, and always involving persons who would be suspected,\"naturally,\" of exaggerating. Goebbels' immediate subordinate in charge of radioin the Propaganda Ministery testified at Nuremberg that he had heard of thegassing of Jews, and went to Goebbels with the report. Goebbels said it wasfalse, \"enemy propaganda,\" and that was the end of it The Nuremberg tribunalaccepted this man's testimony on this\"What Would You Have Done?\"point and acquitted him. None of my ten friends in Kronenberg—nor anyone else inKronenberg—was the immediate subordinate of a cabinet minister. Anti-Nazis noless than Nazis let the rumors pass—if not rejecting them, certainly notaccepting them; either they were enemy propaganda or they sounded like enemypropaganda, and, with one's country fighting for its life and one's sons andbrothers dying in war, who wants to hear, still less repeat, even what soundslike enemy propaganda?Who wants to investigate the reports? Who is \"looking for trouble\"? Who will bethe first to undertake (and how undertake it?) to track down the suspicion ofgovernmental wrongdoing under a governmental dictatorship, to occupy himself, intimes of turmoil and in wartime with evils, real or rumored, that are whollyoutside his own life, outside his own circle, and, above all, outside his ownpower? After all, what if one found out?Suppose that you have heard, secondhand, or even firsthand, of an instance inwhich a man was abused or tortured by the police in a hypothetical Americancommunity. You tell a friend whom you are trying to persuade that the police arerotten. He doesn't believe you. He wants firsthand or, if you got it secondhand,at least secondhand testimony. You go to your original source, who has told youthe story only because of his absolute trust in you. You want him now to tell aman he doesn't trust, a friend of the police. He refuses. And he warns you thatif you use his name as authority for the story, he will deny it. Then you willbe suspect, suspected of spreading false rumors against the police. And, as ithappens, the police in this hypothetical American community, are rotten, andthey'll \"get\" you somehow. So, after all, what if one found out in Nazi Germany(which was no hypothetical American community)? What if one came to know? Whatthen?There was nichts dagegen zu machen, \"nothing to do about it.\" Again and again mydiscussions with each of my friends reached this point, one way or another, andthis very expression; again and again this question, put to me with thewide-eyed innocence that always characterizes the guilty when they ask it of theinexperienced: \"What would you have done?\"What is the proportion of revolutionary heroes, of saints and martyrs, or, ifyou will, of troublemakers, in Stockholm, Ankara, El Paso? We in America havenot had the German experience, where even private protest was dangerous, whereeven secret knowledge might be extorted; but what did we expect the good citizenof Minneapolis or Charlotte to do when, in the midst of war, he was told, openlyand officially, that 112,000 of his fellow-Americans, those of Japanese ancestryon the American West Coast, had been seized without warrant and sent without dueprocess of law to relocation centers? There was nichts dagegen zu machen—noteven by the United States Supreme Court, which found that the action was withinthe Army's power—and, anyway, the good citizen of Minneapolis or Charlotte hadhis own troubles.It was this, I think—they had their own troubles—that in the end explained myfriends' failure to \"do something\" or even to know something. A man can carryonly so much responsibility. If he tries to carry more, he collapses; so, tosave himself from collapse, he rejects the responsibility that exceeds hiscapacity. There are responsibilities he must carry, in any case, and these,heavy enough under normal conditions, are intensified, even multiplied, in timesof great change, be they bad times or good. My friends carried\"What Would You Have Done?\"their normal responsibilities well enough; every one of them was a goodhouseholder and, with the possible exception of Tailor Schwenke, a goodjobholder. But they were unaccustomed to assume public responsibility.The public responsibilities which Nazism forced upon them—they didn't choose toassume them when they chose to be Nazis—exceeded their capacities. They didn'tknow, or think, at the beginning, that they were going to have to carry a guiltyknowledge or a guilty conscience. Anti-Nazism of any sort, in thought or infeeling (not to say action), would have required them, as isolated individuals,already more heavily burdened than they were accustomed to being, to choose toburden themselves beyond their limit. And this, I think, is always the case withpublic responsibilities of a volunteer nature—in Germany, America, anywhere—which promise, at best, a deferred reward and, at worst, an imminent penalty.The American is much better accustomed than the German to responsibilities of avolunteer character, but the principle of rejection is operative here in theUnited States, too, although the load limit is greater. The greater the combinedload of my private and required public responsibility, the weaker my impulse totake volunteer public responsibility; if I'm building a new house and I have toenrol in Civilian Defense, my work with the Boys' Club will suffer. Andanti-Nazism in a Nazi dictatorship was no Boys' Club.Responsible men never shirk responsibility, and so, when they must reject it,they deny it. They draw the curtain. They detach themselves altogether from theconsideration of the evil they ought to, but cannot, contend with. Their denialcompels their detachment. A good man—even a good American—running to catch atrain on an important assignment has to pass by the beating of a dog on thestreet andconcentrate on catching the train; and, once on the train, he has to considerthe assignment about which he must do something, rather than the dog-beatingabout which he can do nothing. If he is running fast enough and his assignmentis mortally important, he will not even notice the dog-beating when he passes itby.The Federal Bureau of Investigation, with its fantastically rapid development ofa central record of an ever increasing number of Americans, law-abiding andlawless, is something new in America. But it is very old in Germany, and it hadnothing to do with National Socialism except to make it easier for the Nazigovernment to locate and trace the whole life-history of any and every German.The German system—it has its counterpart in other European countries, includingFrance—was, being German, extraordinarily efficient. American tourists arefamiliar with the police identity cards they fill out pro forma at Continentalhotel desks. Resident nationals don't fill out a card when they come to live ina German town or leave it; they fill out a life-history for the police.Policeman Hofmeister explained to me, with enthusiasm, how thoroughly theidentity system meshed in Germany, before Nazism, during Nazism, and sinceNazism. Every town has a criminal registry which contains, always up to date,the record of every person born in the town (no matter where he now lives) whohas ever been in \"trouble\"; in addition, the registry contains the whole recordof any person who has ever committed a crime (or been arrested) in the town, nomatter where he was born. \"Consider,\" said Policeman Hofmeister, anunenthusiastic Nazi, \"how nearly impossible it is, and always has been, inGermany for anyone to escape or lose' himself. In such a country, my friend, lawand order rule always.\"\"What Would You Have Done?\"How nearly impossible it is to escape, once a man has come into conflict withthe police. Better, far, if you have ever before come into conflict with them(or if you suspect that you have ever come under their suspicion), to come intocontact with them on their side; best of all, never come into contact with themat all. Don't see the dog-beating on the street or the wife-beating or theJew-beating or anything. You have your own troubles.Everyone everywhere has his own troubles. Two hundred miles from Kronenberg wasthe great chemicals plant of Tesch & Stabinow. In 1942, the manager—he is not a\"little man/' like my friends, but a manager—gets his first government order forCyclon-B gas, which could be used as an insecticide but wouldn't be likely to be(especially since the order is \"classified,\" secret). Now Tesch & Stabinow hasbeen producing poison gases for the Army's chemical warfare service, which has acolonel of engineers attached to the plant for consultation. But this order isnot for the Army, and there has been no consultation. The manager may haveheard, or guessed, that the famous \"final solution of the Jewish problem\" was tobe mass death by gas; Cyclon-B would be the most suitable preparation for thislimited purpose. We learned at Nuremberg that the entire extermination programwas directed without written orders, a remarkable fact in itself; still, a bigman whose business is poison gas for the government may have heard, or guessed.Perhaps the manager shows the order to the colonel, who is not a \"little\" man,either.What did these two big men—not little men, like the Nazis I knew—do then, atthat moment, with the government order on the desk between them?What did they say?What didn't they say?That is what we did not find out at Nuremberg. That is what we never find out atNuremberg. That is what we have to imagine. And how are we to imagine it?—We arenot colonels or plant managers or Nazis, big or little, with a government orderon the desk between us, are we?"},{"pageContent":"Everyone has his own troubles.None of my ten Nazi friends ever knew—I say knew—of these great governmentalsystems of crime against humanity. None of them except possibly (quite probably,I believe) Tailor Schwenke, the SA Sturmfiihrer, ever did anything that weshould call wrong by the measure we apply to ourselves. These men were, afterall, respectable men, like us. The former bank clerk, Kessler, told his Jewishfriend, former Bank Director Rosenthal, the day before the synagogue arson in1938, that \"with men like me in the Party/' men of moral and religious feeling,\"things will be better, you'll see.\" And Hildebrandt, the teacher, thought thatit had to be expected, under the conditions that obtained in Germany just beforeNazism, that the movement would be proletarian and radical, with fools andvillains in positions of leadership, \"but as more and more decent citizensjoined it, it would certainly change for the better and become a biirgerlich,bourgeois development. After all, the French Revolution had its Robespierres,nicht wahr?\"My friends meant what they said; they calculated wrong, but they meant what theysaid. And the moral and religious bank clerk was, on the basis of that mortallywrong calculation, to preach the most barbarous paganism. And the decentbourgeois teacher was to teach \"Nazi literature\" from Nazi textbooks provided bythe Nazi school board. Teachers teach what they are told to teach or quit, andto quit a public post meant, in the early years of the Third Reich,unemployment; later on, when one had an anti-Nazi\"What Would You Have Done?\"political past, it meant concentration camp. \"Once you were in the Party/' saidBaker Wedekind, who doesn't say he ever wanted to get out, \"you didn't get outeasily.\" A man who had always been nonpolitical might get away with \"droppingout\"; a political man, a man who had assumed the political responsibility ofcitizenship, never. Policeman Hofmeister, who had done his duty in Kronenbergsince 1908, did his duty in 1938 when he was ordered to arrest Jews for beingJews. One of those he arrested, the tailor Marowitz, calls him \"a decentman\"—anstandig is the word he used.All this in no degree reduces the number and awfulness of Nazi evils; it reducesthe number and awfulness of Nazi evildoers. It took so few to manage it all, ina country fabled for the efficiency and faithfulness of its civil servants.Policeman Hofmeister was sworn to fidelity to the Fiihrer in a mass-loyalty-oathceremony at the Kronenberg Town Hall early in 1933. The whole civil serviceparticipated and heard the message from Field Marshal Goring himself: \"TheFiihrer knows that every civil servant is faithful to the oath.\" And so theywere, to the holy oath by which Germans (more so than men of either freer orlighter consciences) bound themselves so mortally that the ultimate resistanceto Hitler, which exploded July 20, 1944, lost in advance many bitterly anti-NaziArmy officers who would do anything except violate their sworn word. Thedecision of the resistance conspiracy to assassinate Hitler, rather than arrestand convict him, was made for this very reason; sworn fealty to the Fiihrerbound hundreds of thousands until he was dead.With the civil service and the military safely \"faithful,\" it took so few at theadministrative level and so few more, a million at most, of a population ofseventy million, tocarry out the whole program of Nazi persecution; a million ex-convicts, futureex-convicts, poolroom hoodlums, disheartened young job-seekers, of whom everylarge country has its million. And Germany had, especially in the north andeast, a whole class of recruits better known in eastern Europe and Asia thanelsewhere, the brutally bred young Bauernlcnechte, the quasi-serf farm hands,over whom the landowners up to the end of the first World War had had almostabsolute feudal jurisdiction.The \"democratic/' that is, argumentative, bill-collector, Herr Simon, wasgreatly interested in the mass deportation of Americans of Japanese ancestryfrom our West Coast in 1942. He had not heard of it before, and, when I told himof the West Coast Army Commander's statement that \"a Jap is a Jap/' he hit thetable with his fist and said, \"Right you are. A Jap is a Jap, a Jew is a Jew/'\"A German a German,\" I said. \"Of course,\" said the German, proudly. \"It's amatter of blood.\"He asked me whether I had known anybody connected with the West Coastdeportation. When I said \"No,\" he asked me what I had done about it. When I said\"Nothing,\" he said, triumphantly, \"There. You learned about all these thingsopenly, through your government and your press. We did not learn through ours.As in your case, nothing was required of us—in our case, not even knowledge. YouJhiew about things you thought were wrong—you did think it was wrong, didn'tyou, Herr Professor?\" \"Yes.\" \"So. You did nothing. We heard, or guessed, and wedid nothing. So it is everywhere.\" When I protested that the Japanese-descendedAmericans had not been treated like the Jews, he said, \"And if they hadbeen—what then? Do you not see that the idea of doing something or doing nothingis in either case the same?\"\"What Would You Have Done?\"\"Very early/' he went on, \"still in spring, '33, one of our SA leaders protestedagainst the dismissal of the Ober-biirgermeister, a Social Democrat, a good,really nonpolit-ical man. The SA leader was arrested and taken away. And this,mind you, was when the SA still had great power in the regime. He never cameback. His family is still here. We heard he was convicted, but we never heardfor what. There was no open trial for enemies of the State. It was said itwasn't necessary; they had forfeited their right to it/' \"And what do youthink?\" \"That 7 s a legal question. If the courts say it's so, it's so, gell?\"Cell? is dialect for the rhetorical \"isn't it so?\" \"nicht wahr?\" \"n'est-ce pas?\"and Hessian townsfolk love to use it.A few hundred at the top, to plan and direct at every level; a few thousand tosupervise and control (without a voice in policy) at every level; a few scorethousand specialists (teachers, lawyers, journalists, scientists, artists,actors, athletes, and social workers) eager to serve or at least unwilling topass up a job or to revolt; a million of the Pobel, which sounds like \"people\"and means \"riffraff,\" to do what we would call the dirty work, ranging frommurder, torture, robbery, and arson to the effort which probably employed moreGermans in inhumanity than any other in Nazi history, the standing of \"sentry\"in front of Jewish shops and offices in the boycott of April, 1933.And all the other millions?They had only to go on as they were and keep out of trouble. What could beeasier? \"Only Communists were in trouble,\" said Herr Simon.\"And in Russia,\" I said, \"only anti-Communists.\"\"That's the way it is,\" said Herr Simon.\"But/' said I, \"besides the Communists, there were theSocialists and the Jews and the religious opponents of the regime. They were 'introuble/ too, weren't they?\"\"Oh, yes/' said Herr Simon, ingenuously, \"but that came later. I meant atfirst/'Only Communists were in trouble. And all the other millions of Germans? The SAand the Hitler Youth and the German Maidens marched up the hill and down againon State occasions, which, in such a State, and especially in Germany, arefrequent. The workers were dismissed by the Arbeitsfront, the Stateemployer-employee agency, to watch the SA march, just as the government workersin Washington are given a half-day holiday to swell (or, rather, comprise) thecrowd that lines the capital's streets to welcome the President of Turkey or theEmperor of Ethiopia; in Nazi Germany swelling the crowd was compulsory. Thosewho had uniforms strutted in them on Sundays and came home from their Fridaynight Storm Troop meeting to tell their wives that they had passed a Jewishacquaintance on the street and only nodded to him. And their wives said, \"Gut,\"which, in German, may mean \"Good\" and may mean \"Yes.\"CHAPTER 5The JoinersParty membership in the NSDAP meant absolutely nothing. Like membership in manyorganizations, it was re-stricted for the purpose of whetting the appetite ofthe nonmembers who, by virtue of the restriction, were now excluded. It's an oldcome-one, known to every real estate promoter. When Hitler was released fromprison in December, 1924, he announced that he would accept only 35 per cent ofhis previous followers, and that was all it took to bring 100 per cent of themto heel again.In March, 1933, when membership in the triumphant NSDAP was thrown open,millions joined. These \"March violets/' as they were contemptuously called byboth old Nazis and old anti-Nazis, were band-wagoners. Hitler never trustedthem, and few of them ever rose to high rank. Hitler was right; the \"Marchviolets' 7 joined for good reasons, bad reasons, Nazi reasons, non-Nazi reasons,and even anti-Nazi reasons; and X-number of them for no reason at all—that is,because \"everybody\" was doing it.I do not mean that Party membership was the same as buying a tag on tag day inAmerica, but neither was it without any resemblance. Nor was the Naziblock-manager system the same as the civilian defense organization in America;but neither was it entirely noncomparable. Eager beavers, who constituted adistinctly small minority of theblock managers in Kronenberg, rode herd for all (and more than) they were worth,swaggering, bullying, discriminating, threatening to denounce, and occasionallydenouncing. But the majority served notices of meetings or canvassed forcontributions and did not keep official track of delinquency. InAmerican-occupied Kronenberg, after the war, some of the most enthusiasticorganizers of American-supported projects had been among the most enthusiasticorganizers of Nazi-supported projects. Some of these people were trying to coverup for past misdeeds or mistakes; but most of them were simply enthusiasticorganizers of any-body's-supported projectMen joined the Party to get a job or to hold a job or to get a better job or tosave themselves from getting a worse job, or to get a contract or to hold acontract, a customer, a client, a patient. Every third man, in time, worked forthe State, In the Weimar Republic the German tradition of the nonpolitical,nonparty civil servant (always safely conservative) was broken down; the Nazisfinished the politi-calization of the government workers which the SocialDemocrats began.It would not be reckless to estimate that half the civil servants had to jointhe Party or lose their jobs. The other half were well advised to do likewise,and nearly all of them did. Career men in the central and provincial governmentsand in the city halls, living only for their pensions, could no more resistParty membership (if they ever thought of doing so) than they can the \"kickback\"in our own Tammanies. In the United States the ancient, if not honorable,practice of compelling state payrollers to support the party in power with 1 percent or even 2 per cent of their annual salaries is known colloquially as\"swinging the mace/' In 1954 the Governor of Pennsylvania, admitting that thesys-The Joinerstern was in operation there, said that there was no \"mating\" involved; thecontributions, he said, were voluntary, and no state employee would be fired forfailure to contribute.\"Governor Fine is surely not so naive as his use of that word Voluntary 7 wouldindicate/' said the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette editorially. \"When your politicalbosses, the men who got you your public job, ask you to chip in for the welfareof the party, there's very little Voluntary' about the situation. You don't haveto chip in, true enough, but if you have any brains or ambition, you'd better.To be considered uncooperative by the political bosses is not the best way toadvance or even hang on in a patronage post/' In Germany, where, as everywherein Europe, party membership is formal and the party is supported by regulardues, you did not have to join the National Socialist Party if you were agovernment employee, but, if you had any brains or ambition, you'd better have.The exposure of hundreds of former Nazis in the Foreign Ministry of postwar WestGermany, although it revealed in a half-dozen sensational cases a realpenetration by Nazism of the Adenauer regime, did not tell us, for the rest,whether they were high officials in the Ministry, stenographers, or messengerboys before, during, or after Nazism; or how many of them (if any) had joinedthe NSDAP for the purpose of covering their anti-Nazism, alleviating theapplication of inhuman policies, or even participating from within in ahoped-for (or merely dreamed-of) revolt.Take the late Ernst von Weizsacker, promoted by Nazi Foreign Minister Ribbentropin 1934 from Minister to Switzerland to State Secretary for Foreign Affairs. Henot only became a Nazi; he accepted the rank of brigadier general in theblack-shirted Nazi SS. As Ribbentrop's StateSecretary, he signed the documents by which thousands of Jews were deported toslavery and death. At Nuremberg the American prosecutor called him \"the Devil'sState Secretary\" and ''the executive officer of Murder, Incorporated.\" AnAmerican tribunal convicted him of crimes against humanity.There, certainly, was a Nazi. But at his trial, the diplomats of all the Alliedcountries (including the United States of America) testified to his hatred ofNazism; all the surviving leaders of the anti-Nazi resistance in Germanytestified to his support and encouragement; distinguished Allied churchmen,scholars, scientists, and International Red Cross executives testified to therelentlessness of his efforts to mitigate or circumvent Nazi directives; aprocession of German Jews and Jews of Nazi-occupied countries testified that hisillegal assistance to them had saved their lives. Bishop Primate Berggrav,leader of the Norwegian resistance and President of the World Council ofChurches, said, \"Von Weizsacker was not a Nazi; he was an anti-Nazi. I know thisman in the essential character of his soul. I saw him suffer and serve. If he iscondemned, we are all condemned/'Expressions like \"Nazi teacher,\" \"Nazi actor,\" \"Nazi journalist,\" \"Nazi lawyer,\"even \"Nazi pastor,\" are as meaningless as \"the Devil's State Secretary.\" Mostteachers teach the three R's under all regimes everywhere. Most actors arelooking for jobs anywhere. Most journalists are reporting fires or accidents(with most lawyers hard on their heels) and are writing what the managementwants, whoever the management. And most pastors in Germany had always preachedChrist crucified without seeing—who does?—that he was being crucified all aroundthem every day.There are many lawyers in the United States who disagree vehemently with thepolicies and program of theThe JoinersAmerican Bar Association; but, if they want to practice law, they had betterbelong to the constituent societies of the ABA. There are even more physiciansin the United States who disagree even more vehemently with the policies of theAmerican Medical Association, but, if they want to practice medicine, they hadbetter belong to the constituent societies of the AMA. They may only pay dues,and that grudgingly; but the record shows that they belong. They are officially\"guilty\" of the policies of the organization which speaks in their name. In NaziGermany the professional associations were all \"blanketed\" into the NationalSocialist organization.\"So it was,\" said all of my Nazi (and most, not all, of my anti-Nazi) friendsand acquaintances in Germany, and always with a sigh that said, \"You don'tbelieve it, do you?\"The anti-Nazi son of a railroad worker told me his father's story. In 1931 theGerman state railways were letting men go because of the depression. HerrSchafer, who had no interest in politics, learning that his local boss hadjoined the National Socialist Party, joined it himself in the hope of hanging onto his job. Long after the war, he learned that the local boss had been ananti-Nazi who had joined the Party in the hope of hanging on to his job, becausehis boss, the section superintendent, was an ardent Nazi. And the local boss,assuming that Schafer had joined the Party from conviction, tried covertly toget him fired —unsuccessfully, because the section superintendent was protectingNazis. \"So it was,\" in one instance, in Kronen-berg—perhaps in more than one,and not only in Kronen-berg.None of this means that there was any mass opposition —if opposition is morethan unenthusiasm-—to National Socialism in Germany. No attempt has ever beenmade todiscover its genuine extent. Perhaps no attempt would be feasible. But we knowhow little mass opposition to National Socialism there was prior to 1939 outsideGermany, where opposition would have been less dangerous than it was within.Those who, as Cabinetmaker Klingelhofer said, lived outside the system and werenot its beneficiaries could see its evils better. How many of those saw them or,seeing them, raised their voices even to demand that their own governments grantrefuge to the system's victims? Some few millions of Germans, at least, listenedfor foreign voices to hearten their opposition: from America they heard a few;from England and France, where the Germans listened more closely, still fewer.Moral indignation outside Germany was free, but it was scarce.Nonmembership in the Party meant no more than membership. As some men joined forgood, bad, or no reasons, so some men, for good reasons, bad reasons, or noreason at all, did not join. \"After the war,\" said Herr Hildebrandt, theteacher, \"every nonmember of the Party was an \"anti-Nazi hero/ Some of theseheroes weren't Nazis because of the sixty cents a month dues and for no otherreason/' \"Opposition?\" said Herr Simon, the argumentative bill-collecter. \"Whatdoes 'opposition' mean? Employers opposed the Party because it raised wages,capitalists because it cut profits, loafers because it found jobs; but what dothey all say now? They all say, 'The poor Jews/ All the criminals who didn'tjoin because they were 'on the lam' —now they are 'anti-Nazi persecutees/ \"\"I was a tobacco salesman,\" said Herr Damm, who had risen to be office managerof the Party headquarters in Kronenberg, \"but I was let out when the statetobacco tax was raised 100 per cent in 1930. I reported to the Labor Officeimmediately and wrote applications for every job, butThe JoinersI got no work. At first I drew unemployment compensation, but then, since I wasstill single, I was told I could go back home to the village and live on myfather's farm, which, when my father died, my oldest brother would get. That'sthe way it was in the spring of 1932, when the National Socialists fromKronenberg held a recruiting evening in the village Bierstube. Only one memberof each household was allowed to sign up, and my family all agreed that I wasthe one. I agreed, too. Why not? And, by the way, Herr Professor, it was theonly political party that had ever held a recruiting meeting in our village asfar back as anyone could remember/'Cabinetmaker Klingelhofer was contemptuous when he spoke of those who did notwant to join the Party 'lest something happen, some day\" but who, while thegoing was good, wanted it known that they were the truest of the Nazis. \"My ownbrother-in-law was one, Schuchardt, who had the caf6 in the Mauerweg. I used toargue with him—not to join, no, but to be something, either for or against. Healways said it was for 'business reasons' that he was nonpolitical but, ofcourse, that his heart was with the Party. So he made big contributions to theWinter Relief, always hung out the flag, said 'Heil Hitler 7 a thousand times aday, and then, when the Americans came, he wasn't a Nazi, he had never been inthe Party. Such men play both sides, always. You admire them, their cunning. Butyou wouldn't want to be like them, would you?\" \"No,\" I said.The notes of my conversations with Herr Klingelhofer, made during or immediatelyafter our meetings, quote him as saying, again and again, \"Die freiwiffigeFeuerwehr iibei aJles/ The Volunteer Fire Department above everything!\" and\"Mein Leben fur die freiVillige Feuerwehr/ My lifefor the Volunteer Fire Department!\" I can scarcely believe my own notes; thisearnest, middle-aged German cabinetmaker is as fire-department-crazy as a boy.Kronen-berg, like all German cities under one hundred thousand population, had avolunteer fire department. In 1927 the Fire Chief asked my friend Klingelhoferto join because the department was short a trumpeter. In those days each blockhad a fire trumpeter. The trumpeter had an alarm in his bedroom, and when thealarm rang he blew his trumpet out the window, awakening the other firemen (andeveryone else) in the block. So Klingelhofer, who was interested in trumpetingbut not, in those days, in fire-fighting, joined. \"N'/a, that's me. I alwaysjoined everything/'Beginning in 1932, under the Republic, Klingelhofer took two weeks off from hisshop every summer, at his own expense, to attend the state training school forfiremen. In 1933 he was a squad leader in the freiwillige Feuerwehr when, theNazis having come to power, some of the \"fellows\" said that Party members wouldget promotion preference in the department. \"You see,\" he said, \"before theHitler time, the firemen chose their own leaders, but after 1933 promotions wereproposed by the company chiefs and had to be approved by theOberbiirger-meister. Of course, the Oberbiirgermeister was a Nazi, and, when theold chief, who wasn't, quit in 1934, the man promoted from company chief to takehis place was a Nazi, too. So I joined. Besides, I thought the Party was a goodthing.\"\"Would you have joined if it hadn't been for the Feuer-wehr?\"\"Not then. Later, probably; oh, yes, certainly. But not then.\"\"Why not?\"The Joiners\"Because I was against a one-party State. That was one reason. And I was not astrong nationalist; a Frenchman is a man, just as I am. That was another reason.And the race politics didn't make sense; there is no pure race any more, andinbreeding is bad anyway—we know that from plants and animals and from theinsanity and feeble-mind-edness in the villages where everyone is related toeveryone else. That was another reason. We talked about all these things in theWandervogel, the Youth Movement, when I was young, and I had gone on hikesacross the borders a little way, into both France and Switzerland.\"\"Well/ 7 I said, \"you've given me three good reasons for not being a Nazi.\"\"Und doch war ich in der Parteif And still I was in the Party!\" And he laughedexuberantly, and I with him.Once he was in the Party, he was asked to join the SA and to be a block manager.\"I said 'No/ The Volunteer Fire Department was more important, and I said so.The SA didn't like that, and they said so,\" and he laughed again. \"But we wereindependent until (when was it?) 1934, yes, in the reorganization after the Rohmpurge. Then we heard that all the fire departments would become either technicaltroops of the SA or a branch of the police, and at the firemen's training schoolthat summer we were asked which we preferred. There were fifty men in training,one from each county in Hesse. All fifty of them said the same thing—they wantedneither; they wanted to remain independent\"That's what we said, yes, and that fall we were put under the police, and ourname was changed to Feuer-losch-PoIizei, \"fire-fighting police.\" How is that fora name, Herr Professor?\" and he laughed again.\"Terrible,\" I said, and laughed with him.''So war die Sache. That's the way it was. Well, at least it wasn't the SA. Iwas promoted to adjutant to the new chief. At the end of 1938 the police in thetowns like Kronenberg were put under the SS, so we, the freiwillige Feuerwehr,were part of the Nazi SS! What do you think of that, Herr Professor?\"\"What did you think of it?\"\"Man macht eine Faust im Sack. One made a fist in one's pocket.\" He wasn'tlaughing now, nor was I. Then he brightened and smiled and said, \"Aber, diefreiwillige Feuerwehr iiber alles/\"\"Opposition?\" said Herr Klingelhofer, on another occasion. \"How would anybodyknow? How would anybody know what somebody else opposes or doesn't oppose? Thata man says he opposes or doesn't oppose depends upon the circumstances, where,and when, and to whom, and just how he says it. And then you must still guesswhy he says what he says. So, too, even in action. The few who tried to killHitler and seize the Government in '44, certainly they 'opposed/ but why? Somehated the dictatorship of National Socialism, some hated its democracy, somewere personally ambitious or jealous, some wanted the Army to control thecountry, maybe some could escape punishment for crimes only by a change ofgovernment. Some, I am sure, were pure and noble. But they all acted.\"\"And here in Kronenberg?\"\"Here in Kronenberg? Well, we had twenty thousand people. Of these twentythousand people, how many opposed? How would you know? How would I know? If youask me how many did something in secret opposition, something that meant greatdanger to them, I would say, well, twenty. And how many did something like thatopen-The Joinersly, and from good motives alone? Maybe five, maybe two. That's the way men are.\"\"You always say, That's the way men are/ Herr Klingel-hofer,\" I said. \"Are yousure that that's the way men are?\"\"That's the way men are here/' he said. \"Are they different in America?\"Alibis, alibis, alibis; alibis for the Germans; alibis, too, for man, who, whenhe was once asked, in olden time, whether he would prefer to do or to sufferinjustice, replied, \"I would rather neither,\" The mortal choice which everyGerman had to make—whether or not he knew he was making it—is a choice which weAmericans have never had to confront. But personal and professional lifeconfronts us with the same kind of choice, less mortally, to be sure, every day.And the fact that it is a platitude does not keep it from being true that wefind it easier, on the whole, to admire Socrates than to envy him; to adore theCross, especially on cloudy Sundays, than to carry it. A still young man inBerlin, an actor forbidden employment since the war, said to me: \"I had mychoice of acting for Hitler at home or dying for him in Russia. I preferred notto die for him in Russia, not because I was an anti-Nazi (I wasn't) but becauseI wasn't a hero. If I had wanted to die for Hitler or my country—and this, youunderstand, was the same thing in the war—I would not have waited to beconscripted. I would have enlisted, like a patriot. Tell me, Herr Professor\"—hewas too polite to ask me what I had done in my circumstances—\"what would youhave done in my circumstances?\"CHAPTER 6The Way To Stop Communism\"It had its beginning in Munich/* said my friend Herr Kessler, the one-timeCatholic from Bavaria's neighboring state of Wiirttemberg in southern Germany,\"in the most artistic, cultivated, and Catholic city in Germany, the city of artand of song and of love and Gemiitlichieit, the only city in Germany that allthe foreign tourists always insisted on visiting. There it had its beginning, apurely local affair without any Weltanschauung, philosophy. Nobody outside paidany attention to it. Only after it spread and took root, Bavarians asked, 'Whois Hitler? What is this Party with the fancy name? What is behind it?'\"Hitler was a simple soldier, like millions of others, only he had a feeling formasses of people, and he could speak with passion. The people didn't pay anyattention to the Party program as such. They went to the meetings just to hearsomething new, anything new. They were desperate about the economic situation,'a new Germany* sounded good to them; but from a deep or broad point of viewthey saw nothing at all. Hitler talked always against the government, againstthe lost war, against the peace treaty, against unemployment. All that, peopleliked. By the time the intellectuals asked, 'What is this?' it had a solid basisin the common people. It was the Arbeiter, Sozialist Party, theThe Way To Stop CommunismParty of workers controlling the social order; it was not for intellectuals.'The situation in Germany got worse and worse. What lay underneath people'sdaily lives, the real root, was gone. Look at the suicides; look at theimmorality. People wanted something radical, a real change. This want took theform of more and more Communism, especially in middle Germany, in the industrialarea, and in the cities of the north. That was no invention of Hitler; that wasreal. In countries like America there is no Communism because there is no desirefor radical change.\"Hitlerism had to answer Communism with something just as radical. Communismalways used force; Hitlerism answered it with force. The really absolute enemyof Communism, always clear, always strong in the popular mind, was NationalSocialism, the only enemy that answered Communism in kind. If you wanted to saveGermany from Communism—to be sure of doing it—you went to National Socialism.The Nazi slogan in 1932 was, If you want your country to go Bolshevik, voteCommunist; if you want to remain free Germans, vote Nazi/\"The middle parties, between the two millstones, played no role at all betweenthe two radicalisms. Their adherents were basically the Burger, the bourgeois,the 'nice 7 people who decide things by parliamentary procedure; and thepolitically indifferent; and the people who wanted to keep or, at worst, onlymodify the status quo.\"I'd like to ask the American Burger, the middle-class man: What would you havedone when your country stood so? A dictatorship, or destruction by Bolshevism?Bolshevism looked like slavery and the death of the soul. It didn't matter ifyou were in agreement with Nazism, Nazism looked like the only defense. Therewas your choice/'\" 1 would rather neither/ \" I said.\"Of course, Herr Professor. You are a bourgeois. I was, too, once. I was a bankclerk, remember.\"Of my ten friends, only two, Tailor Schwenke and Bill-collector Simon, the twoalte Kampfer, wanted to be Nazis and nothing else. They were both positive—stillare—that National Socialism was Germany's and therefore their own, salvationfrom Communism, which, like the much more sensitive bank clerk, they both called\"Bolshevism,\" \"the death of the soul.\" \"Bolshevism\" came from outside, from thebarbarous world that was Russia; Nazism, its enemy, was German, it was theirown; they would rather Nazism.Did they know what Communism, \"Bolshevism,\" was? They did not; not my friends.Except for Herr Kessler, Teacher Hildebrandt, and young Horstmar Rupprecht(after he entered the university, in 1941), they knew Bolshevism as a specterwhich, as it took on body in their imaginings, embraced not only the Communistsbut the Social Democrats, the trade-unions, and, of course, the Jews, thegypsies, the neighbor next door whose dog had bit them, and his dog; the bundledroot cause of all their past, present, and possible tribulations. Prior to 1930or 1931, none of my ten friends, except Tailor Schwenke and Bill-collectorSimon, hated any Communist he knew (they were few, in nonindustrial littleKronenberg) or identified him with the specter; these were flesh-and-bloodneighbors, who would not break into your house and burn it down. After 1933 or1934 these same neighbors were seen for \"what they were\"—innocently disguisedlackeys of the specter. The Bolshevist specter outraged the property sense of myall but propertyless friends, the class sense of these declasse Burger, thepolitical sense of these helpless subjects of the former Emperor, the religioussense ofThe Way To Stop Communismthese pro forma churchgoers, the moral sense of these unexceptional characters.It was \"the death of the soul/'The question was not whether Communism threatened the country, as, with thecontinuation of deteriorating conditions, it certainly did or soon would; thequestion was whether the Germans were convinced that it did. And they were. Theywere so well convinced, by such means as the Reichstag fire of 1933, that theNazis were able, ultimately, to establish anti-Communism as a religion, immunefrom inquiry and defensible by definition alone. When in 1937 the Pope attackedthe \"errors\" of National Socialism, the Nazi Government's defense of itspolicies consisted of a Note accusing the Pope of \"having dealt a dangerous blowto the defense front against the world menace of Bolshevism.\"Those Germans who would do anything, be anything, join anything to stopBolshevism had, in the end, to be Nazis. And Nazism did stop Bolshevism. How itstopped Bolshevism, with what means and what consequences, did not matter—notenough, at least, to alienate them. None of its shortcomings, mild or hideous,none of its contradictions, small or calamitous, ever swayed them. To them, thenand now, Nazism kept its promise.Three of my ten friends, the bank clerk, Kessler, the salesman, Damm, and thetailor's apprentice, Herr Schwen-ke's son Gustav, were unemployed when theyjoined, and the first two were family men in middle life at the time. In allthree cases they joined, I think, because they were unemployed—which is not inthe least to say that they would not have joined if they hadn't been. The twoOld Fighters, Tailor Schwenke and Bill-collector Simon, when they joined in1925, were both employed (the tailor self-employed), but the inflation which hadjust ended had re-duced them (and nearly all other petit bourgeois Germans) to near-starvation.Willy Hofmeister, the old policeman, joined the Party in 1937 because the newPolice Chief said that all the men must join. When I asked him if he could haverefused, he said, \"Ein Miffionar war ich /a gar nioht. A millionaire I was not\"(The Sicherheitspolizei, or detective force, one of whose five members he was inKronenberg, was subsequently attached willy-nilly to the Gestapo, just as theVolunteer Fire Department was placed under the SS). Horstmar Rupprecht, thestudent, had been a Nazi since he was eight years old, in the Jungvolk, the\"cub\" organization of the Hitler Jugend; his ambition (which he realized) was tobe a Hitler Youth leader; in America he would certainly have been a Scoutmaster.The two most active churchmen of the ten, Herr Klingel-hofer, the cabinetmaker,and Herr Wedekind, the baker, both of them vestrymen of their parish church,were the two who today (and, I think, yesterday) put the most emphasis on the\"everybody-was-doing-it\" theme. (They were both \"March violets/') The fact thatthey were, of the ten, the two retail tradesmen doubtless contributed to theirsensitivity to this urge to go along (mitschwimmen was the term each of themused) with the Party as they had with the Church; the cabinetmaker freelyadmitted that his church activity \"didn't hurt\" his coffin-making, althoughneither he nor I would say that he was a churchman because it was good businessto be one.Neither Klingelhofer nor Wedekind read the Party Program, the historicTwenty-five Points, before they joined, while they were members, or afterward.(Only the teacher, of the ten, ever read it.) But they were earnestly impressed,as were most ardent churchgoers in the early years of theThe Way To Stop Communismmovement, by the Program's demand, of which every one of my friends had heard,for \"positive Christianity\" for Germany. The baker left the vestry board in1937, when the Church-Party struggle had become intense. He says he leftvoluntarily, as a \"good Nazi,\" because he felt that his Party loyaltycompromised his position on the board; his pastor confirms his assertion. But hedid not leave the church. Herr Klingelhofer—\"I always joined everything\"—remained a vestryman to the end.All ten of my friends, including the sophisticated Hilde-brandt, were affectedby this sense of what the Germans call Bewegung, movement, a swelling of thehuman sea, something supraparty and suprapolitical, a surge of the sort thatdoes not, at the time, evoke analysis or, afterward, yield to it. These men werevictims of the \"Bolshevik\" rabies, to be sure. They were equally victims ofeconomic hardship and, still worse, of economic hopelessness, a hopelessnessthat they suffered more easily by identifying it with their country's. But theywere seekers, too, and affirmers—agents, not just patients.Their country was torn to pieces from without, of course, but still more cruellyfrom within. Germans had been at one another's throats since 1918, anddissension grew shriller and more bitter all the time. In the course of thedecomposition, the principle of being German, so newly won under Bismarck and sopreciously held for fear of its slipping away, was indeed being lost. Theuniting of the country, of all of its people, was possible only on this oneprinciple of being German, and my ten friends, even including the old fanaticSchwenke, onlookers at the disruptive struggles of the old parties and the oldparty politicians, at the process of shredding the mystical fabric whichsupportedthis principle, asked, \"Where is Germany?\" Nazism—Hitler, rather—knew this andknew that nothing else mattered to my friends so much as this, theidentification of this Germany, the community again, in which one might know hebelonged and, belonging, identify himself. This was the movement which anynon-German might see at once for what it was; and this was the movement whichrestored my friends as the sight of home restores the lost child; or as thesight of the Lorelei Maiden, seen sitting high above the Rhine, combing hergolden hair with a golden comb in the surprising late sunshine, bewitches thesailor, who overlooks the rocks beneath the river.National Socialism was a revulsion by my friends against parliamentary politics,parliamentary debate, parliamentary government—against all the higgling and thehaggling of the parties and the splinter parties, their coalitions, theirconfusions, and their conniving. It was the final fruit of the common man'srepudiation of \"the rascals/' Its motif was, \"Throw them all out/' My friends,in the 1920's, were like spectators at a wrestling match who suspect thatbeneath all the grunts and groans, the struggle and the sweat, the match is\"fixed,\" that the performers are only pretending to put on a fight. The scandalsthat rocked the country, as one party or cabal \"exposed\" another, dismayed andthen disgusted my friends. (One sensed some of this reaction against thecelebrated Army-McCarthy hearing in the United States in 1954—not against oneside or another but against \"the whole thing\" as \"disgusting\" or \"disgraceful\")While the ship of the German State was being shivered, the officers, who alonehad life-preservers, disputed their prerogatives on the bridge. My friendsobserved that none of the non-Communist, non-Nazi leaders objected to theThe Way To Stop Communismmovement, by the Program's demand, of which every one of my friends had heard,for \"positive Christianity\" for Germany.

My friendsobserved that none of the non-Communist, non-Nazi leaders objected to theThe Way To Stop Communism35,000 Reichsmark salaries of the cabinet ministers; only the Communists and theNazis objected. And the bitterest single disappointment of Nazism—both to Simon,the insensitive bill-collector, and to Hofmeister, the sensitive policeman—wasthe fact that Hitler had promised that no official would get more than 1,000Reichsmarks a month and did not keep his promise.My friends wanted Germany purified. They wanted it purified of the politicians,of all the politicians. They wanted a representative leader in place ofunrepresentative representatives. And Hitler, the pure man, the antipolitician ?was the man, untainted by \"politics/' which was only a cloak for corruption. The\"mink coat\" scandal in the United States at the beginning of the 1950's had itscounterpart in Berlin in the beginning of the 1930's, when the Nazis focusedtheir campaign for the mayoralty on the receipt by the wife of the SocialDemocratic mayor of a fur coat from a man who did business with the city.Against \"the whole pack,\" \"the whole kaboodle,\" \"the whole business/' againstall the parliamentary politicians and all the parliamentary parties, my friendsevoked Hit-lerism, and Hitlerism overthrew them all. The power struggle withinthe National Socialist Party, which culminated in the Rohm purge of June 30,1934, was in essence parliamentary and political, but my friends never knew it.They accepted it as a cleanup of moral degenerates, and if they caught a glimpseof the reality underneath the official propaganda, their nascent concern wasdissipated by the fact that the Fiihrer acted with an instant and terrible swordand the \"debate\" with Rohm was finished; the Fiihrer held the country and thecountrymen together.This was the Bewegung, the movement, that restoredmy friends and bewitched them. Those Germans who saw it all at thebeginning—there were not very many; there never are, I suppose, anywhere—calledHitler the Ratten-fa'nger, the \"rat-catcher.\" Every American child has read ThePied-Piper of Hamlin. Every German child has read it, too. In German its titleis Der Rattenfanger von Hameln.CHAPTER /\"We Think with Our Blood\"Heinrich Hildebrandt joined the Party in 1937. He may not have been the only oneof my ten friends who was afraid not to join, but he was the only one of themwho knew then and now, and says so, that fear was his reason-fear and advantage.(\"But how/' he said, \"is one to separate them?\") He had been an anti-Nazi, anactive moderate democrat in East Prussia before he came quietly to Hesse in 1935and, his past uneasily buried, got a job teaching literature and French in theKronenberg Realgymnasium, the humanistic high school. An anti-Nazi and acultivated man, more clearly aware than most men of the primitive considerationswhich directed his course of action—and yet he, too, once he was inside thesystem he hated, sheep that he was in wolfs clothing, found something profoundlygood in it.\"Perhaps,\" he said, \"it was because I wanted, unconsciously, to justify what Ihad done. If so, I succeeded. But I say it now, too, and I know it now. Therewere good things, great things, in the system—and the system itself was evil/'\"For instance?\"\"You mean about the evils?\"\"No, I know about those. About 'the good things, the great things/ \"\"Perhaps I should make it singular instead of plural, the good thing. For thefirst time in my life I was really the peer of men who, in the Kaiser time andin the Weimar time, had always belonged to classes lower or higher than my own,men whom one had always looked down on or up to, but never at. In the LaborFront—I represented the teachers' association—I came to know such people atfirst hand, to know their lives and to have them know mine. Even inAmerica—perhaps; I have never been there—I suspect that the teacher who talksabout 'the common people' has never known one, really known one, not even if hehimself came from among them, as I, with an Army officer as a father, did not.National Socialism broke down that separation, that class distinction.Democracy—such democracy as we had had—didn't do it and is not doing it now.\"\"Wedekind, the baker,\" I said, \"told me how 'we simple working-class men stoodside by side with learned men, in the Labor Front/ \"\"I remember Wedekind/' said the teacher. \"I didn't know him before I joined theParty, and I don't know him now. Why? Because he was my inferior. A baker isnothing, a teacher is something; in the Labor Front we belonged to somethingtogether, we had something in common. We could know each other in those days. Doyou understand that, Herr Professor?\"\"I understand it because you call me 'Herr Professor/ \" I said, smiling.\"Yes. The baker calls me 'Herr Studienrat'—that was my rank—and I call you 'HerrProfessor/ It is for me to accept the baker and for you to accept me.\"\"Neither the baker nor the teacher would call a professor 'Professor' inAmerica,\" I said.'We Think with Our Blood\"\"Never?\"\"Rarely. I can't remember ever having been called 'Professor/ except by friends,who in an argument might say ironically, 'Professor, you're crazy/ \"\"It was never like that in Germany/' he said, \"or anywhere else in Europe—noteven, from what I know, in England. Always in Germany, before Nazism, and againnow, the title is a genuine reflection of class distinction.\"I told Herr Hildebrandt of an incident a German friend, an eminent physicist,had recently reported to me. He was returning to Germany from a scientificcongress in Amsterdam, and an American colleague was traveling with him. At theNetherlands-German border the American discovered he had lost his passport. Myfriend observed that both the Dutch and the German passport inspectors wereelderly men, obviously relics of the Imperial days, and he said to the two ofthem, \"Gentlemen, I am Professor Doktor Karl Otto, Baron von G , and you have myword that Professor W possesses a valid passport properly visaed, whichhe has mislaid. I take personal responsibility for Professor W—'s transit.\" \"Itwas a gamble,\" the physicist said, in reporting the incident to me, \"but itsucceeded. The obvious duty of the two old inspectors was overridden by theword of a Professor Doktor Baron, and W came in withme. He was amazed.\"\"Why was he amazed?\" said the teacher, when I told him the story.\"Because,\" I said, \"every side-show medicine salesman in America calls himself'Professor/ and a man who calls himself 'Baron' or 'Count' is an obvious fraud.An American passport inspector would have turned to one of his colleagues andsaid, 'Here's a hot one, Joe. The \"Professor\"wants in and he hasn't a passport. What're you peddling, \"Professor,\" cocaine?'\"\"You exaggerate a little?\" said the teacher.\"A little,\" I said, \"but only a little.\"\"I understand,\" he said. \"This is your American feeling of absolute equality.That we have never had here. But there was a democracy in Nazism, and it wasreal. My— how shall I say it?—my inferiors accepted me.\"My inferiors accepted me.The German schoolteacher found himself, in Nazi Germany, as, I dare say, anyschoolteacher finds himself in any emerging totalitarianism, in a uniquesituation which constituted a compulsion upon him unknown (or less painfullyknown) to other kinds of workers. The National Socialist development entailedthe inexorable displacement of the teaching profession from its position in theGerman community. The teacher everywhere in Europe is much more highly honoredthan his American counterpart, and more highly paid. In addition, he has had, inEurope, an education so far beyond the financial ability of nearly all hiscountrymen that the very fact of his being a teacher is taken as evidence of hisfamily's having been prosperous, and the prosperous, in Europe no less than inAmerica, are highly honored and highly paid.In the small community, the village, and even the town, the teacher and thepastor stand alone in Germany, the two Respektpersonen, far above the mayor orthe merchant. And, because of the Church-State identity, they stand together asthe arbiters of the community's moral and cultural, as well as its religious andintellectual, life. In the village which has only a visiting pastor who comesevery second Sunday, the alternative sermon is \"naturally\" preached by theteacher. Religious education was officially,until 1918, an element of elementary-school education. And the teacher is likeas not the organist in the village church.The pastor sits in judgment on the old, the teacher on the young and on theyoung's relations with the old. In the villages the parents are still literallyafraid of the teacher. His knock at the door in the evening, when the child hasmisbehaved at school that day, means that the parents will have to promise, thenand there, specific disciplinary action. The call will not be social, and themother as well as the father will rise when he enters the house. If, on ahappier occasion, he is willing to accept an invitation to call socially, thehouse will be cleaned and warmed, cakes will be baked, and the good wine broughtout.In Tailor Schwenke's childhood, at the end of the Nineteenth Century, theteacher had been there \"all his life.\" He may have come to the village directlyfrom the teachers' college, or he may have made one or two changes in his youthbefore he settled down to stay. The pastor, with his circuit of two or threevillages, was likelier to change his residence or even go up the professionalladder. Young Karl-Heinz Schwenke's teacher had taught Karl-Heinz's father andhad even taught the grandparents of some of the village children; these, grownto be parents and grandparents, saw their teacher still when he came to thedoor. And, where the parents might not have close contact with the pastor, theycould not help having it with the teacher, who, besides learning the familysecrets from the feckless offspring, had to be called in to help transact suchbusiness, especially official business, as transcended the father's grasp orself-confidence.In the summer, in Karl-Heinz's village, the teacher went through the streets at9 P.M., in the winter at dark; if he108found a child on the street, his knock was heard at the door that same evening.At his own discretion, he himself did the disciplining with his Rohrstock. Ifthe Rohrstock was a hazel branch, it was possible to cut it part way throughwhen the teacher was out of the room, so that, when applied, it would fly topieces. But Herr Pietsch, who was wise in the ways of three rising generations,had a bamboo stick, which, besides being harder to cut, had a greaterflexibility than hazel, adding injury to insult.One day when the future Sturmfiihrer Schwenke was eleven, he ditched school inthe afternoon to engage in the revolutionary act of stealing cherries. Thatnight Herr Pietsch came by the Schwenkes'. Karl-Heinz was lucky; his father,who, like all very small farmers, was often away from home working for otherfarmers, was away that night, and Mother Schwenke beat the truant. The boy'sluck lay in the fact that his mother's beating him meant that she would not tellhis father, who would have beat him much harder. But the luck didn't last, forHerr Pietsch knew that Father Schwenke was away and that mothers' hands aresometimes unconvincingly light. The next morning, at the opening of school,Karl-Heinz received the bamboo treatment. The beating was so fierce that the boybit the teacher's leg; then the teacher beat him harder. \"Much harder?\" I said.\"So much harder,\" said the old tailor, \"that the whole class howled with painjust to see it. That old man Pietsch,\" the arsonist of the Kronenberg synagoguewent on, \"he was a regular devil.\"The regular devil showered down favors, too, but never on Karl-Heinz, who waspoor in his studies. The favorites, who might be the best students, and whomight be the worst students who belonged to the best families, were allowed ahalf-hour out of school to go, in turn, to the teach-\"We Think with Our Blood\"er's house each day to shine his shoes. Did the parents know this? Of course.Were the children paid? Of course not. What did the parents and children thinkabout it? They didn't think about it.The authoritative, not to say authoritarian, role that the teacher played in theGerman community, a role which declined very little in the \"democratic\" daysbetween 1918 and 1933, is wholly foreign to the American tradition of that sadsack, the schoolteacher (as witness the life and times of Ichabod Crane in TheLegend of Sleepy Hollow). The teacher in Germany once was, and often is now, theonly person in the community who has attended a nonvoca-tional secondary school;the fact that everyone else can read and write does not mean that the villagersdo not come to him with important documents to be read or written properly. Heis quite likely to be the only university graduate in the village. And he iscertain to be the leading cosmopolitan, in respect not only of learning but alsoof mobility. Two or three merchants may be richer, the landowner certainly so,but they do not waste their money on travel. No professional in America has thestatus of the teacher in Germany, and to have achieved, as Herr Hilde-brandtdid, the rank of Studienrat (which means senior high-school teacher), with itstitle no less than its tenure and pension, is an eminence which no Americanteacher dreams of.As the recognized repository of the community's intellect, the teacher wouldprobably be a political conservative, a man not to be influenced by reformers.As a man who, although decently paid, still had to live on a state salary, hewould still more probably want to identify himself with the wealthiest membersof the community, who could afford to pay him for special lessons for theirchil-dren. As a State employee, he would not be likely to disagree with Bismarck. Buthe would not, for all this, be a political protagonist or even a consciouspolitical partisan. He would be above politics, not merely as the public serviceis above politics, but as the intellect is above politics. His business, and hisalone in the community, is thinking, just as the horseshoer's, and his alone, ishorseshoeing. Laymen do not presume to advise, still less to command, experts.And, while the historic sterility of German education may be laid in part to theacademic's unaccountability, there was, in the pre-Hitler community, anindependent, if a rigid and shallow, mind.This mind was a bulwark, however fragile, not against National Socialism butagainst National Socialism's transition from practice to theory; for Nazism,unlike modern Communism, began with practice. Because the mass movement ofNazism was nonintellectual in the beginning, when it was only practice, it hadto be anti-intellectual before it could be theoretical. What Mussolini'sofficial philosopher, Giovanni Gentile, said of Fascism could have been bettersaid of Nazi theory: \"We think with our blood.\" Expert-ness in thinking,exemplified by the professor, by the high-school teacher, and even by thegrammar-school teacher in the village, had to deny the Nazi views of history,economics, literature, art, philosophy, politics, biology, and education itself.Thus Nazism, as it proceeded from practice to theory, had to deny expertness inthinking and then (this second process was never completed), in order to fillthe vacuum, had to establish expert thinking of its own—that is, to find men ofinferior or irresponsible caliber whose views conformed dishonestly or, worseyet, honestly to the Party line. The nonpolitical pastor satisfied Nazirequirements by\"We Think with Our Blood\"being nonpolitical. But the nonpolitical schoolmaster was, by the very virtue ofbeing nonpolitical, a dangerous man from the first. He himself would not rebel,nor would he, if he could help it, teach rebellion; but he could not help beingdangerous—not if he went on teaching what was true. In order to be a theory andnot just a practice, National Socialism required the destruction of academicindependence.In the years of its rise the movement little by little brought the community'sattitude toward the teacher around from respect and envy to resentment, fromtrust and fear to suspicion. The development seems to have been inherent; itneeded no planning and had none. As the Nazi emphasis on nonintellectual virtues(patriotism, loyalty, duty, purity, labor, simplicity, \"blood/ 7 \"folk-ishness\")seeped through Germany, elevating the self-esteem of the \"little man,\" theacademic profession was pushed from the very center to the very periphery ofsociety. Germany was preparing to cut its own head off. By 1933 at least five ofmy ten friends (and I think six or seven) looked upon \"intellectuals\" asunreliable and, among these unreliables, upon the academics as the mostinsidiously situated.Tailor Schwenke, before the first World War, had made suits for some of theprosperous professors of Kronenberg University. If, as of course he did, heresented their superior station, he was nevertheless proud and boastful of beingtailor to such a distinguished trade. In 1925, when he was starving and joinedthe new political movement, they, although they were no longer able to ordertailor-made suits, still had their sinecures, and he was no longer able toidentify himself with them; they were sinking, as he was, but they had muchfurther to sink. In 1927 he left the Partyin the hope of recapturing their custom; he himself says this is why. But whathe calls the \"boycott\" persisted (partly, of course, because the ready-made suithad taken the custom tailor's place).In 1931, when Tailor Schwenke rejoined the Party, his Nazi indoctrination plushis personal experience had awakened his hostility toward professors in general,many of whom in Kronenberg, he told me, were Communists. (None was.) And in1933, when the Party came to power, he was given a school janitor's job—with, ofcourse, the title of Hausmeister—and the command of the local SA Reserve Troop.From that point on, he had no difficulty in placing academics (who, no doubt,had been patronizing when they were patrons) entirely outside the pale of thegreat community, the New Germany, which he now represented.He was not, of course, sure of the New Germany or of himself; he was still,after fifty years of being Karl-Heinz Schwenke, Karl-Heinz Schwenke, and theHerr Professor was still the Herr Professor. The New Germany was, of course,Schwenke's, but the Herr Professor had something, and something German, that theNew German had not. Tailor Schwenke would not, after 1933, any more than before,have failed to tip his hat to the Herr Professor; all the more joyously hereceived the revelation that half the academics were traitors and the other halfdupes and boobies who might be tolerated—under close surveillance—by the NewGermany which Tailor Schwenke, at your service, Sir, represented.CHAPTER 8The Anti-Semitic SwindleGustav Schwenke, the tailor's son, was twenty when he became a Nazi. This was in1932. His father's business had collapsed; he himself, after his apprenticeshipto his father, had never found work. There was simply no work to do for astrong, intelligent, well-trained young man of nineteen, eighteen, seventeen,sixteen. For four years he had gone on foot, like hundreds of thousands of otheryoung men, from village to village, looking for work. Apart from an occasionalodd job, he had, during this period, two months of state work relief service onthe roads, for food and lodging and two dollars a week. Then his \"old sickness/'bed-wetting, came on him again and he had to go home and start over. But henever became a bum or a brawler; he slept only in youth hostels or in thefields. And then, in 1932, Gustav Schwenke became an SA policeman, for pocketmoney and a uniform—and a place in the sun. What Gustav Schwenke wanted, and theonly thing he wanted, was security. The job he wanted, and the only job he everwanted, was a job with the State, any job with the State, with its tenure, itsinsurance, and its pension. Gustav was not, I imagine, the only boy born inGermany in 1912 who wanted security and thought, until 1933, that he would neverhave it. When he got it, when the Party Police were incorporated into theMilitary Police in 1935,his dream was come true. At last he belonged. He was a man at last,As a boy, Gustav had clung to his father and kept away from his mother. Healways did his homework in the afternoons in his father's workshop in the frontof the house. There he fed on his father's manhood, which took the form ofpolitical power, and starved out his mother's womanhood, which took the form ofdomestic power. When he was seven he heard his father call the WeimarConstitution Dreclc, dirt. So Gustav hated the Constitution. (He didn't knowwhat it was.) When he was eleven, a customer came in to call for a suit, whichhad been ordered eight days before for 8,000 Reichsmarks; now, eight days later,8,000 Reichsmarks would buy one pound of butter; and, when Gustav asked hisfather what caused the inflation, his father said, \"The Jews.\" So Gustav hatedthe Jews. (He didn't know any Jews and wouldn't have bothered them if he had.His father would.)Old Karl-Heinz Schwenke was a product of \"the golden time\" before the firstWorld War. Even in the golden time he had, as he said, \"only been a tailor.\"\"But I had ten suits of my own when I married,\" said the iron-faced old dandy.\"Twenty-five years later, when their 'democracies' got through with me in 1918,I had none, not one. I had my sweater and my pants. Even my Army uniform wasworn out. My medals were sold. I was nothing. Then, suddenly, I was needed.National Socialism had a place for me. I was nothing—and then I was needed.\"\"And now,\" I said, \"you are down to your sweater and pants again.\"\"Yes,\" he said, \"now that their 'democracies' are through with me again.\"The Anti-Semitic Swindle\"National Socialism,\" I said, gently, \"didn't leave its enemies that much.\"\"They had it coming. You see what their 'democracies' did to us/'By \"they\" Herr Schwenke always meant the Jews. He was the most primitive of myten friends. He was a very limited man. Facts, although he could apprehend them,had no use he could put them to; he could neither retain nor relate them. Hecould talk, but he could not listen. I let him talk.\"They say six million Jews were killed\"—not that \"we\" or even \"the Nazis\" killedthem—\"but when you see how many there are all over the world today, there arejust as many as ever. There are fifteen million in America—\"\"Only six or eight, I believe,\" I said.\"Naturally, that's what they tell you. Do you know how many there are in Russiaright now? They control the government, money, everything, everywhere.\"I wanted to tell him a story, but I didn't. It's a story about a Jew riding in astreetcar, in Germany during the Third Reich, reading Goebbels' paper, theVolJa'sche Beo-bachter. A non-Jewish acquaintance sits down next to him andsays, \"Why do you read the Beobachter?\" \"Look,\" says the Jew, \"I work in afactory all day. When I get home, my wife nags me, the children are sick, andthere's no money for food. What should I do on my way home, read the Jewishnewspaper? Togrom in Roumania/ 'Jews Murdered in Poland.' 'New Laws againstJews/ No, sir, a half-hour a day, on the streetcar, I read the Beobachter. 'Jewsthe World Capitalists/ 'Jews Control Russia/ 'Jews Rule in England/ That's methey're talking about. A half-hour a day I'm somebody. Leave me alone, friend.\"National Socialism was anti-Semitism. Apart from anti-Semitism, its character was that of a thousand tyrannies before it, with modernconveniences. Traditional anti-Semitism—what Nietzsche, beloved by the Nazis forhis superman, called \"the anti-Semitic swindle\"—played an important role insoftening the Germans as a whole to Nazi doctrine, but it was separation, notprejudice as such, that made Nazism possible, the mere separation of Jews andnon-Jews. None of my ten friends except Herr Hildebrandt, the teacher, had everknown a Jew at all intimately in a town of twenty thousand, which included anine-hundred-year-old Jewish community numbering six or eight hundred persons.The last traces of the ghetto had gone a century and more ago. Generation aftergeneration, these people went on living together, in a small town, with anonexistent wall between them over which the words \"Good morning\" and \"Goodevening\" were tossed.My ten friends had all had business relations with Jews, as both buyers andsellers. Springer, the Jewish jeweler, had even belonged to the town Glee Club,along with the Schwenkes, father and son. \"I bought Mushi's wedding ring fromSpringer,\" said the tailor, patting his old wife's hand.\"Why from a Jew?\" I asked.\"N' /a,\" said the arsonist of the synagogue, \"we always traded with Springer.For a Jew, he was decent.\" I thought of Tacitus' observation on the Hessiantailor's forebears: \"The Chatti [Hessians] are intelligent, for Germans.\"Seven of my ten friends had known Springer over a period of years, and all sevenof them, when I interrupted their animadversions on the Jews to ask them if theyhad ever known a decent Jew, named Springer first They had traded with him, sungwith him, marched with him (in veterans' organizations), but he had never beenin anyThe Anti-Semitic Swindleof their homes nor any of them in his. None of them knew how many children hehad or where his ancestors came from.\"What became of him?\" I asked the tailor.\"Oh, he went away.\"\"Where?\"\"I don't know. South America, maybe. It was early\"— that meant before thesynagogue burning of 1938—\"and a lot of them went to South America orsomewhere.\"None of the seven knew what had become of Springer.I asked Horst Rupprecht, the student and Hitler Youth leader, who had livedaround the corner from the synagogue and the Hebrew school, if as a child he hadhad Jewish friends. \"Certainly,\" he said at once. \"I never had a fight with aJewish boy.\"\"I don't mean that,\" I said. \"I mean, did you play with any?\"\"Oh, no,\" he said.\"Why not?\"\" 'Why not?' I don't know. They played together, and we played together.\"In the Dark Ages the Jews had to separate themselves to preserve theircommunion, just as the Christians (and the Jews) had had to do inpre-Constantine Rome; in the Middle Ages their separation had been recognizedand progressively enforced by the non-Jews. But, with the elimination of theformal ghetto in Germany, under Napoleon, the causal conditions of separationhad declined. Moses Mendelssohn's translation of the Pentateuch into Luther'sHigh German, at the end of the eighteenth century, had drastically reduced (andwas on its way to eliminating) the linguistic separation. In the late nineteenthand early twentieth centuries the formal economic, edu-cational, and occupational disabilities had all been progressively lifted (thelast, in the Army and the higher civil service, after the first World War).As the disabilities against them disappeared, the Jews disappeared. They hadnever numbered more than 1 per cent of the German population, and their rate ofapostasy was higher in modern Germany than anywhere else except Italy. After thefirst World War, social scientists predicted that within two generations therewould be no more Jews in Germany. The progression from orthodoxy to agnosticism(via \"liberalism\") was the largest factor, underlying the conversion ofthousands to nominal Protestantism, which had economic and, more significantly,social advantages, and even to Catholicism. Conversion tended, within limits, toremove the \"cold\" discrimination in the universities and the professions.Noblemen, Army officers, and professors married daughters of wealthy Jewishfamilies, and the motivation was not always money; many Jews of consequence,having fallen away from their faith, ran as fast and as far as they could fromit, and the distinguished non-Jew had his pick of not merely wealthy, butcultivated and beautiful young women. This did not, of course, affect the\"little man\" in Germany except, when he heard of it, to make him hate the \"Jewplutocrats\" a little more. Nor was he mollified when he heard thatintellectuals, artists, \"bohemians\" intermarried without thought of religiousdistinction.Jewish \"suicide,\" by apostasy or conversion, was thus reducing the Jews withoutreducing anti-Semitism; on the contrary. Four years before Hitler was born inAustria, that country's great anti-Semite, Von Schonerer, said, \"Ob Jud, obChrist ist einerlei, in der Rasse liegt die Schweinerei. Whether he says he's aJew or a Christian doesn't matter,The Anti-Semitic Swindlehe's depraved by race.\" Conversion and intermarriage simply shifted the emphasisfrom the economic and the civil to the racial basis of hatred, and, in doing so,invigorated in new and virulent form the anti-Semitism of the \"little man/' who,whatever else he was or wasn't, was of German \"blood/' Long before the firstWorld War, lower-middle-class holiday places, such as the island of Borkum, werebeginning to boast of being /udenfrei.After all their centuries of exclusion from all the honorable pursuits, the Jewshad turned, as their liberation began in the eighteenth and nineteenthcenturies, to the \"free professions,\" those which were not organized as guildsor associations excluding them: medicine, law, journalism, teaching, research,and, of course, for the greater part, retail merchandise. (The poorer among themhad turned, when they were driven out of the towns in past centuries, to theonly possible occupation, the ancestor of retail trade: peddling). Thus the Jewswere, on the whole, better off in the years of inflation after the first WorldWar because a smaller proportion of them than of non-Jews were on fixed moneyincomes of wages, salaries, or pensions; and the \"old\" Jews of Kronenberg were,before Nazism, nearly all \"comfortable.\" No one in Kronenberg was rich.Besides the \"old\" Jews, there were the \"new\" ones, who had come principally fromPoland after the first World War, who spoke Yiddish instead of German and livedas best they could—which might mean peddling and might mean pandering and mightmean speculation of the pettiest or the wildest sorts. The Jewish community inKronenberg had very few \"easterners\" or, as the \"old\" Jews called them, \"kikes.\"There were some, of course.The tailor, Salo Marowitz, had been a Russian soldier,married to an ''Aryan\" wife after his release from a German prison camp afterthe first war. He was honest and respectable, a good man and a good Jew but (asthe ''old\" Kronenberg Jews said) a ''kike/ 7 There was no doubt that theMarowitzes' older son, Samuel, was born before his parents were married—the kindof scandal that died hard among the \"old\" German Jews, whose illegitimacy rate,even in the postwar years, was almost nil. Still, he was an honest man.The three brothers Lipsky, from Poland, were honest, too, but their professionwas less creditable. They were notion-peddlers, and they had little dignity.They couldn't afford to have, perhaps; they were none of them very bright. Eventhough they knew that Tailor Schwenke was a violent anti-Semite, they still cameto his house trying to sell him soap. He always called them names and slammedthe door on them, but they always came back. The youngest Lipsky, somehow comeby the good German name of Bruno, was badly crippled from the waist down. Whenhe walked he had to throw his legs out in front of him, which was enough to makechildren laugh. Back in the 1920's, when the Reichswehr was supposedly limitedto 100,000 men, Kronenberg had a \"nonmilitary\" battalion which drilled in whiteshirts, and Bruno insisted on marching beside them, whistling. He would havemarched later alongside the SA if they'd let him. He was not very bright.The Kronenberg Jews were dying out fast enough before Nazism. After 1933 theybegan moving away from Kronenberg, and from Germany. Most of them stayed on—theydidn't believe that \"it\" would last forever—until the synagogue burning and thepogrom laws of late 1938. But the Jewish community, as a formal organization towhich almost every Jew, through choice, heredity, inertia, or socialThe Anti-Semitic Swindlecompulsion belonged in a small town, was shrinking steadily before 1933.There was a special reason for the decline of Kronenberg Jewry. The Jewishcommunity, like the town itself, was conservative, old-fashioned, and pietistic.The younger generation, since the first World War, had been turning away fromthe Tuesday and Thursday prayer service, from the prayer shawl and the whiteKitI to be worn at the Passover ceremony, even from learning Hebrew. It is truethat nearly all of them attended the synagogue school rather than public school;but this was largely a hangover from the days just gone when Christian religiousservices were part of the public school program. Look at Springer, the jeweler:a member of the community, yes, but when his father died in the 1920's, he hadthe tombstone inscription carved in German instead of Hebrew!The Kronenberg synagogue had, under this kind of pressure in the 1920's,inaugurated new, more acceptable \"German'' customs and abandoned some of the oldsacramental and liturgical forms. It had become more liberal. At the time theNazis came to power, the synagogue's Shames, or sexton, a non-Jew, lit fires inonly a dozen homes of members who still observed the rigid Saturday Shabbathprohibition against work, and Jewish-owned shops were open on Saturdays andclosed on Sundays, just like the Gentiles'.The concessions to liberalism had not arrested the decline of the Kronenbergcongregation. After 1933, however, it began to grow again, in spite of the factthat members were emigrating. Some of those who remained and had fallen awayfrom the faith came back. The Jewish Charity was, of course, more active than ithad ever been before, with the demands imposed by the continuing boycott, andthe children (who, if they attended a public school and did not belong to theHitler Youth, had to remain in the schoolroom alone when the rest were dismissedfor celebrations) were all back in the synagogue school.True, the Jews had been disappearing in Germany; and intermingling, at least atthe higher levels of culture and society, had been increasing. But thenonexistent wall between the Jews and the \"little men\" of Germany was as high asever, and it was a wall with two sides. It was not clearly and simply a matterof exclusion but, rather, of two-way separation, of the independent existence oftwo communities in one town, a condition which distinguished the small-townsituation in Germany from anti-Semitism in, say, the United States.In this separation the devil slumbered and in slumber built sinew before Hitlerwas born. \"When I was a boy/' said the old tailor whom the teacher had caned,\"there were maybe half-a-dozen Jew boys in the village. They had their ownschool and learned Yiddish—\"\"Hebrew,\" I said.\"Hebrew, if that's what it was, and they could talk to each other in it so thatthe German kids couldn't understand them. They could understand us, but wecouldn't understand them. When there was trouble, just kid trouble, they wouldtalk Yiddish to each other. It scared a person; do you know what I mean?\" I saidI did. And I did.When my friend Kessler, the former bank clerk, was a child in a Catholic villagein Wiirttemberg, a Jewish peddler came to his village once a month. The peddlertransacted all the villagers' business for them, including their banking,without charge, and in return he stayed two or three days with the families ofthe village, in rotation, on his monthly visits. \"He was just like a member oftheThe Anti-Semitic Swindlefamily to us children/' said Herr Kessler, \"except for one thing. After dinner,when we read from the Lives of the Saints, the peddler went into the corner andstood there facing the wall and put a shawl on and a band around his foreheadand said prayers different from ours. It must have frightened us somehow,because I remember my mother's saying not to be frightened—it was because he wasa Jew he did that. We did not know what 'Jew' meant.\"I remembered him only many years afterward, after the first war, when I firstheard Nazi propaganda in Munich. And I remembered how I had been afraid—perhapsonly mystified, but I suppose that with children the two are the same—when theJew stood in the corner, facing the wall, with that band around his forehead,saying prayers we couldn't understand, in Yiddish.\"\"In Hebrew,\" I said.\"Yes, in Hebrew.\"\"Did your memory of the peddler make you anti-Semitic?\"\"No—not until I heard anti-Semitic propaganda. Jews were supposed to do terriblethings that the peddler had never done. And still—I had been frightened by himwhen he prayed, although I think I really loved him otherwise. The propagandadidn't make me think of him as I knew him but of him as a Jew. And it was as aJew, praying alone, that he frightened us. So I suppose that, in the end, thatwas part of it, of my anti-Semitism, I can still make myself frightened, putmyself back there. I hear my mother saying not to be frightened.\"CHAPTER 9\"Everybody Knew/ 7 \"Nobody Knew/'When people you don't know, people in whom you have no interest, people whoseaffairs you have never discussed, move away from your community, you don'tnotice that they are going or that they are gone. When, in addition, publicopinion (and the government itself) has depreciated them, it is still likelierthat you won't notice their departure or, if you do, that you will forget aboutit How many of us whites, in a white neighborhood, are interested in thedestination of a Negro neighbor whom we know only by sight and who has movedaway? Perhaps he has been forced to move; at least the possibility occurs to us,and, if we are particularly sensitive, and we feel that perhaps a wrong has beendone that we can't rectify, it is comforting to hear that the Negro was also aCommunist or that he will be happier wherever he's gone, \"with his own people,\"and was even paid a handsome bonus for moving.Four of my ten Nazi friends—the tailor and his son, the baker, and thebill-collecter—said that the only Jews taken to Kah-Zed, concentration camp,were traitors; the rest were allowed to leave with their property, and, whenthey had to sell their businesses, \"the courts\" or \"the finance office\" paidthem the market value. \"I've heard that the Jews who left late could only takefifty or a hundred Marks with them/' I said to the tailor, who was talking about\"Everybody Knew.\" \"Nobody Knew.\"\"the courts.\" \"I don't know about that/' he said. \"How should I know aboutthat?\" He had \"known,\" a moment before, about \"the courts,\" but I didn't remindhim. \"I've heard,\" I said to Herr Simon, the bill-collector, who was talkingabout \"the finance office,\" \"that they could only take part of their propertywith them.\" \"Well, why not?\" said Herr Simon. \"If they wanted to leave, theState had a right to a share. After all, they had made their money here.\"The fact is, I think, that my friends really didn't know. They didn't knowbecause they didn't want to know; but they didn't know. They could have foundout, at the time, only if they had wanted to very badly. Who wanted to? Wewhites—when the Negro moves away—do we want to find out why or where or withwhat he moved? The teacher, the student, the cabinetmaker, and the bank clerk,these four at least, suspected the truth of the \"market value\" myth, and thepoliceman, to whom you or I would intrust our goods and our chattels withouthesitation after five minutes of talk, spoke with contempt of the \"weisseJuden,\" the \"white Jews,\" the hawks who fell upon the property that the Jews hadto sell in a hurry. Four of my friends suspected the truth, at the time; whatshould they have done?\"What would you have done, Herr Professor?\" Remember: the teacher excepted, nineof my ten friends didn't know any Jews and didn't care what happened to them—all this before Nazism. And it was their government, now, which was carrying onthis program under law. Merely to inquire meant to attack the government'sjustice. It meant risk, large or small, political or social, and it meant riskin behalf of people one didn't like anyway. Who but an ardent Christian, of thesort that takes Matthew 5 seriously, would undertake the risk of inquiring; who,if injusticewere to be discovered by inquiry, would undertake the penalty of protesting? Iam sorry to say that none of my friends was that ardent a Christian.But Cabinetmaker Klingelhofer, he who remained a vestryman of the churchthroughout Nazism, was as ardent a Christian as most vestrymen I have met, andhis idea of relaxation, during our conversations, was to turn to religiousquestions. \"I know it's not what you're interested in, Herr Professor, but I'dlike your views/' One day, by way of relaxation, we went through Matthew 24together. (I didn't say that I was interested or that I wasn't, but I did saythat reading aloud with a German friend improved my German. ) I read, from theninth through the thirteenth verses, to improve my German:\"Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and yeshall be hated of all nations for my sake.\"And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another.\"And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many.\"And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold.\"But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.\"I stopped, looked up, and then looked at Herr Klingel-hofer. His head—this wasmy ebullient friend, \"My life for the Volunteer Fire Department!\"—was lowered. Iwaited. He said, without looking up:\"Das ist schwer, Herr Professor. Das ist kolossal schwer. That's hard. That'sterribly hard.\"And it is hard. It is said to be hard to be a Christian— or even to want tobe—under the most propitious of condi-\"Everybody Knew.\" \"Nobody Knew.\"tions. The conditions in Nazi Germany were not the most propitious. Justconsider:Jews, because they were in such high proportion in the \"free professions/'tended to be the people one owed money to for goods or services alreadydelivered, for merchandise, say, or for medical care. Now I, in America, cannotwell pay my doctor's bill. My doctor is a nice fellow, but his bills, howeverlow they may be, are too high; I didn't want to be sick in the first place, and,now that I'm well, I wish I hadn't had to buy the medical care I no longer need.I wish my doctor well, believe me, and my dentist and my merchant and my lawyerand the jeweler who repaired my watch; if any of them are Jews, I still wishthem well, because I am not anti-Semitic. (Remember, my Nazi friends were.)Now let us imagine that the Jews are emigrating from America, as fast as theycan. They liquidate their assets, at whatever loss, and collect such debts asare collectable in a week or a month. Small debts they don't bother with. Theymay send out a bill with the word \"Please\" written on it; but I can't pay it,not this month. What I can't avoid wondering is whether my Jewish dentist ordoctor or shopkeeper is thinking of emigrating, winding up his affairs, closinghis office or shop, selling out (I may still have to pay my debt some day, if heis able to sell his uncollected bills), taking his whole family with him, losinghis citizenship and his power to pursue me with his bills. Of course, I'm a nicefellow, too, so I say, 'Til pay when I can.\"But I won't. I won't have to. And I know I won't have to, although in my waking,honorable hours I may not know that I know I won't have to. But—oh, if thatdoctor and his bills, that dentist and his bills, only didn't exist. A Jewishphysician in Kronenberg emigrated in 1936. I wasable to talk to him after I got back to America, and, when I had asked him whatdecided his course in 1936 and he had given me the usual good reasons, he added:\"I remember the very occasion which fixed my decision. I was in the publictelephone room at the Frankfurt railroad station, and I heard the man in thenext booth say, 'Don't pay him. Just don't pay him. Don't argue with him. Don'tcall him names. Don't waste your breath. Be polite. But don't pay him. Mark rnywords—in another six months or a year you won't have to pay at all. Hold himoff.' It was something like that. 'Jew' wasn't mentioned; I don't know who theman was or even what he was talking about. But that decided me. It took methree, four months, to get a sponsor in America and get everything together. Isent bills out. Some were paid, some in full, some in part. I collected morethan half of what was owed me; after all, these people had been my patients, andthey were decent people. And 1936 was still early. Later, of course, it wasdifferent.\"In 1934 I visited a family of remote relatives of mine in a country villageoutside Hannover. These Jews were small shopkeepers; they had been there forseven centuries, and there were too few of them to constitute a formal Jewishcommunity. There was no anti-Semitism in Eichdorf. (There was no intermarriage,either.) In those first years of Nazism their non-Jewish friends continued totrade with them openly; later, secretly. Little children—it began with littlechildren—who called them names on the street were taken home and spanked. Thevillagers, except for a few officials and a few young rowdies, simply would notlet Nazism have its way, not in Eichdorf.Nine years later, in 1943, the Jews of Eichdorf were \"sent away.\" In such asmall community they could not be \"sent\" unnoticed. After the war one of theirneighbors was\"Everybody Knew/' \"Nobody Knew/'telling about it: \"Everybody knew, but nobody came out on the street. Somelooked from behind their curtains, not many/'\"Did you?\"\"No.\"\"Why not?\"\"Why? What good is it to look?\"Kronenberg was, of course, bigger. None of my ten friends ever saw any Jewsleave in a group. It wasn't required that they see. Only Policeman Hofmeister,of the ten, knew of the details of the departure of the Jews, and he only oftheir departure, not of their destination. And only Herr Hildebrandt, theteacher, ever corresponded with any Jews afterward or knew what had become ofthem. Everyone knew that Jews were moving away, from 1933 on. All of my tenfriends had heard that these Jews or those were going or gone. A Jewish womancame to Herr Wedekind's bakery to pay her bill and wanted to make sure thatthere was nothing left owing him. \"You're leaving?\" he said. \"Yes,\" she said.That was all. Three of my friends heard, during the war, that a bus load of Jewshad left the Market Place at dawn one day. That was all.Shortly after the war began, a group of Jews were seen working on the street,laying blocks in the trolley-car track (Jews were now forbidden any but commonlabor). Hofmeister waved a greeting to some he knew but didn't talk to them.Cabinetmaker Klingelhofer spoke to one he knew, a lawyer, who had been acustomer of his. \"Did you ask him how he happened to be there?\" I said.\"No. I knew.\"\"How?\"\"Everybody knew.\"\"How?\"\"Oh—we just knew.\"\"What did you say to him?\"\"I asked him how he was, and he said, Tine/ He looked all right/'\"Did you shake hands with him?\"\"No. . . . One doesn't shake hands with a man who is busy with both hands, nichtwahr?\"\"No, not in America, but you Germans always shake hands so much, I thoughtmaybe—. By the way, Herr Klingelhofer, do you think you were brave to talk withhim on the street?\"\"Brave? No, not brave. Maybe, a little. No, not really. My loyalty was known.\"Herr Kessler, the unemployed bank clerk risen to Party speaker and departmenthead in the local Labor Front, saw Stein on the Kronenberg platform waiting, ashe himself was, for the northbound train. He had known Stein well, in a businessway; Stein, to help him out when he was unemployed, had always hired him toaudit the books of his dry-goods store. The Jew was an old man. It was—when wasit? —early in 1939. \"He pretended not to see me. Maybe he thought it wouldembarrass me, or just that I wouldn't want to talk to him. That was wrong; Iwasn't a FanatfJcer. Finally I went up to him and shook hands and asked him howhe was. He said, Tine/ I couldn't ask him how his business was, because I knewhe had sold out. Then, when the train was coming, I said, 'Are you going away,Herr Stein?' Of course he was going away, or he wouldn't have been waiting forthe train, but a man may go away for a day or forever; I didn't ask that. Isaid, 'Are you going away, Herr Stein?' He said, Tes,' and then I said, 'Well,goodbye/ and held out my hand, but he had already turned away.\"\"Did you both get on the train?\"\"Everybody Knew.\" \"Nobody Knew.\"\"Yes.\"\"Together?\"\"No. He got on the nonsmoker end of the car, and I got on the smoker.\"\"Did you smoke?\"\"No.\"I did not initiate the discussion of the Jews with any of my ten friends.Somewhere between the beginning of the second conversation and the end of thefourth, each of them introduced the subject, and each of them, except MessrsHildebrandt, Kessler, and Klingelhofer, reverted to it continually. I would askTailor Schwenke, \"Did you like the Program, in 75?\" \"The Party Program?\" hewould say. \"Yes, it was very good, very. Take the Jewish question, forinstance \" (In a subsequent conversation he said he hadnever seen the Party Program.)Of the ten men, only the teacher, Hildebrandt, was not anti-Semitic. Thepoliceman, a fine old man, did not want to be; but he was. The student, youngRupprecht, thought he wasn't anti-Semitic, but in his case I am not at all sure;he was glib. Kessler and Klingelhofer, the two deepest-feeling of my friends(except Hildebrandt), were the mildest; their anti-Semitism was not at all\"racial\" and almost entirely economic, \"rational.\"Klingelhofer's father, from whom the son had taken his trade as cabinetmaker,had told him that Jews were all right: \"They were people, like other people, butyou couldn't trust them in money matters, that was all. If you went to a Jew todo business, that was one thing, but if a Jew came to you to do business, thatwas another.\"\"Why do you suppose that was?\" I said.\"I don't know. I don't know. I remember my father telling me about Moses, whoseleather-shop was in the Bahn-hofstrasse. My father did lots of work for him, and they got along fine. Mosesonly paid his accounts on Sunday mornings and he always paid a 'round sum/ noPfennige. And he always deducted 3 per cent/'\"Why?\"\"I don't know. That was his custom, I guess. So my father always arranged hisaccounts so that the 3 per cent was already in. You may say 'cheating thecheater/ but it wasn't like that, exactly. Moses was a nice man. My father likedhim. But my father always said that you couldn't trust a Jew in money matters.And he was right/'\"Were you ever cheated by a Jew?\"\"No, but that was because I was warned and was careful. If you're careful, youhave no trouble with them.\"\"Were you careful with Professor Freudenthal?\" (Freu-denthal, who committedsuicide in 1933, had been a customer of Herr Klingelhofer's and had sent him awedding present, a piano shawl of which my friend was proud.)\"No. With him you didn't have to be.\"The former bank clerk's thinking was much larger than the cabinetmaker's. TheJews had accumulated too much of the country's economic power; \"they should havebeen reduced economically to their proper proportion in the population.\"\"How should that have been done?\"\"That's what I don't know, but a way should have been found without deprivingthem of their citizenship or mistreating them.\"\"Did they exercise this power badly?\"\"In a way. I suppose anybody would, especially if he was looked down on, likethe Jews. But it seemed to be very bad with the Jews.\"\"Do you mean that they introduced a 'Jewish spirit' into\"Everybody Knew.\" \"Nobody Knew.\"economic life? I have heard other National Socialists say that\"\"Well, that was the propaganda, of course, part of the whole 'race' thing, but Iwouldn't say that. There is and there isn't a 'Jewish spirit/ but certainly theaggressiveness and competitiveness of some Jews led to abuses—for instance, topornography in the press, just to sell papers and magazines/'\"'Of some Jews/\"I said. \"Oh, yes, of some; not all.\" \"And of some non-Jews.\"\"Of course. That's why I don't like to speak of a 'Jewish spirit/ But there wereso many more Jews than non-Jews in these things, proportionately. That's what Imean.\"Not one of my ten friends had changed his attitude toward the Jews since thedownfall of National Socialism. The five (or six, if young Rupprecht isincluded) who were extreme anti-Semites were, I believe, not a bit more or lessso now than before. What surprised me, indeed, was that, with the war lost andtheir lives ruined, they were not more so. Certainly Nazism's defeat by forcewould not make Nazis love the Jews more; if anything, less. Nor would theircountry's destruction. Nor would the three-quarters of a billion dollars theirconquerors compelled them to pay, as restitutive damages, to the Jews of Israel.And the five extremists had never seen the inside of the local Ameriia-Haus orany other agency of \"re-education\" and never would.They, and, to a degree, even the bank clerk, the cabinetmaker, and thepoliceman, took the greatest pains to convince me that the Jews were as bad asthe Nazis said they were. I sat passively, every so often asking a questionwhich betrayed my simple-mindedness, while my friends pressedtheir argument. If I diverted them, they came back to it. The one passion theyseemed to have left was anti-Semitism, the one fire that warmed them still. Ithought, as they went on, of the customary analysis: We have to justify ourhaving injured those we have injured, or we have to persuade others to ourguilty view in order to implicate them in our guilt. I thought a little, but Ididn't say much. What could I have said?CHAPTER 10\"We Christians Had the Duty\"Herr Simon, the bill-collector, was visiting me. He had brought tulips to mywife, as, when I went to his house, I took candy to his. We were drinkingcoffee, he and I, as, at his house, we (or, rather, I; he was a teetotaler,\"like Hitler\") always drank wine. He was interested in finding out aboutAmerica, at least in talking about it. I was telling him about the reservationof powers to the states in our federal system—.\"Do you know any Jews over there, Herr Professor?'' he said.\"Oh, yes,\" I said, \"many, quite well. They live among us over there, you know,just like other people/ 7\"Not like Negroes/' said the \"Old Fighter/' \"But,\" he went on, \"I want to askyou about the Jews. Can you always tell a Jew when you see one, over there? Wecan, here. Always. They're not like you and me.\"\"How can you tell?\" I said. \"They sometimes look like you and me.\"\"Certainly,\" he said, \"sometimes. It isn't by looks, though. A German can tell.Always.\"\"Well,\" I said, like a man who is saying to himself, \"You learn something newevery day.\"\"Yes,\" he said.Then I said, \"Could you tell, if you saw Jesus, that he was a Jew, Herr Simon?\"\"I think so,\" he said, \"if he was a Jew. But was he a Jew? If he was, why didthe Jews kill him? Can you tell me that?\"—He went right on—\"I've never heard apastor say that Jesus was a Jew. Many scientists say he wasn't. I have heardthat Hitler himself said that he was the son of a Greek soldier in the RomanArmy/'\"I never heard that/ 7 I said. I was lying; Reinhold Hanisch, in his memoirs,says that Hitler told him that in 1910, when they were living together in aVienna flophouse.\"Yes,\" said Herr Simon, \"and do you know, Herr Professor, the Jews have a secretBible, called the Talmud. Maybe you never heard that, either, but it's true.They deny it, of course. You just ask a Jew about it, and watch him when he saysit doesn't exist. But every German knows about it; I've seen it myself. It hastheir ritual murder in it, and everything else. It tells them—mind you, it waswritten I don't know how many centuries ago—that they must marry German womenand weaken the German race. What do you think of that?\"What did I think of that? I thought I would telephone the dean of thetheological faculty at Kronenberg University and ask him, even though it was aSunday night and a blowy one, to bring a German Talmud to my house. That, I saidto myself, will do it, much better than my telling him I'm a Jew. If, I said tomyself, I tell him I'm a Jew now, he will be so furious at my previous deceptionof him that I shall have no opportunity to point out to him that he didn't knowa Jew when he saw one. I wanted a minute to think it over, first.\"You say,\" I said idly, \"that you have seen this—this—?\"\"Talmud,\" said the bill-collector, a small, spectacled man who needed a strongmustache (he had a weak one). \"But watch out, Herr Professor, that they don'tfool you.\"We Christians Had the Duty\"I've seen the real one. The Jews would show you a fake, if you trapped them, andeven in your own universities you will find professors in the pay of the Jewswho will tell you that it is genuine. We had such professors here—before. Andagain now, of course/'What did I think of that? I thought that I would not telephone to the dean, and,later on, as I said, \"We'll have to have many more talks, Herr Simon/' I thoughtthat we'll have to have many more generations of Herr Simons, emerging, somehowwithout being led or driven, from the wilderness in which this generation ofSimons lived with their \"real\" Talmud.I was visiting Tailor Schwenke, my lusty old Fanatilcer friend. He was in hissweater and pants, and we were having soup and unbuttered bread, a meal which,German country bread being what it is, was not so light as it sounds. His wifehad baked a cake, and I had brought tea. \"And so,\" I was saying, \"we come to theend of your father's life-story, and that brings us to the end of the story ofall your ancestors on both sides, down to you. I marvel, Herr Schwenke, that youknow so much about each one of them, for so many generations back.\"\"That's the way we Germans are,\" said my friend. \"We are proud of our families.The Americans took my Bible— they sent a Jew to do it, naturally—or I could giveyou all the dates exactly, birth, baptism, marriage, children, death.\"\"Your family,\" I said, very carefully, \"seems always to have been lucky. Neverany great troubles. Never lost their homes or their land. A very unusual family,always to have had such good fortune.\"\"Always, always,\" said the tailor. \"As far back as we go-up to my own badfortune—it was always very good, withmy father, my grandfathers, my great-grandfathers, all of them/'This exchange occurred in our fourteenth conversation. In the course of thesecond, long before we had begun the remarkably detailed examination of thelives of his ancestors, he had talked about the Jews, saying, \"I had reasonenough to hate them, even before, for the way they ruined my ancestors forgenerations back. Stole everything from them, ruined them,\" and his face wasfurious with filial wrath.I think that my friend believed what he was saying— at the time he was sayingit—both in our second conversation and in our fourteenth. I might have shot homethe contradiction. It would not have made him any less anti-Semitic, and,besides, men's lives are what they think they are. So I didn'tI was visiting Herr Damm, the country boy who, his oldest brother being destinedto get the family farm under Hessian primogeniture, had come to Kronenberg toget a job. He lost it in the depression and went back home, joined the Party atthe \"recruiting evening\" the Nazis held in the village in 1932, and rose to beoffice manager of the Kronenberg Party headquarters. It was the twelve hundredthanniversary of the founding of the country village, where the Damms had settledin AJ>. 808, and I was attending the celebration.\"Yes,\" said Herr Damm, \"our family were always great anti-Semites. My father andgrandfather were followers of Dr. Bockel, who founded the Anti-Semitic Party inHesse, way back in the eighties. We used to have the Party flag, with theanti-Semitic inscription on it, 'Freedom from Jewry/ but the Americans took itaway.\"\"Did you ever have any dealings with Jews?\" I said.\"We Christians Had the Duty\"\"Always/ 7 he said. \"We had to, in the country. Before the farmers' credit unionwas founded by Dr. Bockel—it was anti-Semitic, to save the farmers from theJews—we were at the mercy of the cattle dealers. They were all Jews, and theyall worked together.\"\"How do you know that they all worked together, Herr Damm?\"\"They always do. They held us in the palm of their hand. Do you know what one ofthem once did? He bought a calf from my father and took it to town and sold itto my father's cousin, at a profit.\"\"Yes,\" I said, \"but that is just the profit system. You believe in the profitsystem, don't you? You're certainly no Communist!\"\"Of course,\" he said, \"but only think—to my father's own cousin! If my fatherhad known his cousin wanted the calf, he could have sold it to him himself,without the Jew.\"-Well-\" I said.\"Look, Herr Professor, a Jew buys a cow. When he buys it, it's terrible,everything's wrong with it, he wouldn't have it for a gift. So he pays a fewMarks for it. Then he goes to the next farmer with it, to sell it, and it's themost wonderful cow in the world. Do you see what I mean?\"\"I think so,\" I said, wreathed, internally, with a smile as I thought of \"theAmerican Way,\" \"but don't Germans,\" that is, non-Jews, {< buy as low and sell ashigh as possible?\"\"Yes, but that's just it. Look, Herr Professor,\" he went on, patiently, \"Germanscouldn't trade with one another. There was always a Jew between them. All Jewsare Handler, traders, never workers or farmers. Every child knows this. Alltrade was in the hands of the Jews. What couldwe poor Germans' 7 —he was speaking of what Hitler calls, in Mein Kampf, the\"genius-race\"—\"do?\"I liked Herr Damm. He was a professional clodhopper-he had been used for Partywork among the farmers, whose \"language,\" that is, whose mind, he spoke—but hewas still a clodhopper. On another occasion, he was visiting me in town; or,rather, since it was to be our last talk together, I was his host at aone-dollar de luxe dinner at Kronenberg's best restaurant. I brought the talkback to one of our first conversations, in which he had told me that he was theonly Kreisamtsleiter in our whole Gau who had refused to leave the Church. \"Itold them I was born in the Church,\" he had said, \"and I would die in it, andnot in the 'German Church/ but the Christian Church,\"\"Now,\" I said, as we were lighting up after dinner, \"what many Christians inAmerica cannot understand is how you Christians in Germany could accept thepersecution of the Jews, no matter how bad they were. How could you accept it asChristians?\"It was the first time I had taken the initiative on the subject. \"The Jews?\"—hesaid—\"but the Jews were the enemies of the Christian religion. Others might haveother reasons for destroying them, but we Christians had the Christian duty to.Surely, Herr Professor, you know how the Jews betrayed our Lord?\"None of my friends was the least interested in Nazi race theory as such, noteven the tailor or the bill-collector. Five of the ten of them laughed when theyspoke of it, including the cabinetmaker. \"That was nonsense,\" said HerrKlingelhofer, \"for the SS and the universities. Look at the shape of my head:broad as a barnside. Look at my brunette wife. Do you suppose we're not Germans?No; that they could teach to the SS and the university students. The\"We Christians Had the Duty\"SS Flott [\"cream/' sacastically] would believe anything that made them great,and the university students would believe anything complicated. The professors,too. Have you seen the 'race purity' chart?\" \"Yes,\" I said. \"Well, then, youknow. A whole system. We Germans like systems, you know. It all fitted together,so it was science, system and science, if only you looked at the circles, black,white, and shaded, and not at real people. Such Dumm-heit they couldn't teach tous little men. They didn't even try.\"What my friends believed—and believe—is an accumulation of legend, legend whichcomes to them no more guiltily than the cherry-tree story comes to us. Only intheir case, esteeming themselves as they did as \"little men,\" \"little people,\"who did not amount to anything except in so far as they were Germans, the legendof a people among them who were not Germans and who, therefore, were even lessthan they, was especially precious.Nobody has proved to my friends that the Nazis were wrong about the Jews. Nobodycan. The truth or falsity of what the Nazis said, and of what my extremistfriends believed, was immaterial, marvelously so. There simply was no way toreach it, no way, at least, that employed the procedures of logic and evidence.The bill-collector told me that Jews were filthy, that the home of a Jewishwoman in his boyhood town was a pigsty; and the baker told me that the Jews'fanaticism about cleanliness was a standing affront to the \"Germans,\" who wereclean enough. What difference did the truth, if there were truth, make?I suggested from time to time, and always in hesitant fashion, that perhaps themedieval exclusion of Jews from citizenship and landholding, their subsequentexclusion, after 1648, from guild apprenticeship, and their confine-ment for a thousand years to the practice of moneylending, with the attendantrisk of the despicable creditor against the knightly debtor, might have requiredcunning of most of the Jews in most of early Europe as the condition of survivalitself; that the consequent sharpening of the intellect under such circumstanceswould have produced a disproportionate number of unusually noble and unusuallyignoble dispositions among any people, their unusualness, in the marginaloccupations to which they were driven, disappearing as the great communityremoved the disad-vantagements which produced it. I reminded the bank clerk,Kessler, that the ancestors of the Christians who now forbade Jews to be bankpresidents once compelled them to be. He was a Swabian, from Wiirttemberg, andthe Swabians are humorous—\"for Germans/' as Tacitus would say. He appreciatedthe joke.None of my ten friends argued with me when I said these things. None of them,except the bank clerk and, of course, the teacher, listened. Everything I said,all of them might have learned long ago. But there are some things thateverybody knows and nobody learns. Didn't everybody know, in America, onDecember 8, 1941, that the Japanese, or Japs, were a treacherous people?In the American Embassy in Berlin, in 1935, an official of the German ForeignPress Office told me the story of a North Sea town where there had never been aJew. When Goebbels announced the boycott of the Jews for the month of April,1933, the Biirgermeister of the town sent him a telegram: \"Send us a Jew for ourboycott/'CHAPTER 11The Crimes of the LosersLong before the second World War ended, the Allies decided that, in case theywon, they would not again write a \"war guilt\" clause (which the Germans wouldagain repudiate) into the peace treaty. They would this time, by a great legalproceeding, convict the Germans of their guilt under international law andconvince them of it. And this time the guilt, in addition to breach of thepeace, would include war crimes and crimes against humanity. The day theInternational Military Tribunal opened at Nuremberg, the American prosecutor,Justice Jackson of the United States Supreme Court, called the occasion \"a raremoment in history/' and the day after the Nazi leaders were hanged the New YorkTimes said: \"Mankind has entered a new world of international morality.\"The Nazi leaders were hanged, but they were not impressed. They pleaded, duringthe legal proceeding against them, that they had all acted under orders (wasn'tNazi Germany a dictatorship?); that, if anyone were guilty, their judges were asguilty as they themselves were (especially the Russians; why, they asked,wouldn't the Tribunal press the charge it had made that it was the Germans, notthe Russians, who had slaughtered the Polish officers in the Katyn Forest?);that international law was law only by analogy, that it wasn't codified, thateven if it were codifiedit would not supersede national law (which, obviously, they had not broken), andthat even if it were codified and superseded national law it would not permitone party to a suit to try another or bring only one party, rather than both, totrial.There were Americans who wondered whether the Nuremberg gallows trap was a wideenough entrance to a new world of international morality for mankind, but suchwonderers were not numerous in 1946. Most Americans were satisfied with theoperation, even if they did not share the premature ecstasy of Justice Jackson.But the succeeding \"international\" tribunals at Nuremberg, twelve in all, had tobe conducted by the United States without the co-operation of its Allies.Nuremberg, after the \"big show\" of the IMT trial, lost its interest, not onlyfor the other three European Allied governments, but also for most Americancitizens. It was water over the dam—spilled milk, at worst.But it was gall, if not wormwood, for the Germans, and not just for the Nazisamong them. As far as my ten friends were concerned, the Nuremberg method ofconvincing them of their guilt was a failure. It was not that it miscarried; itsimply had no fundamental effect on them at all. It was taken as an incidentalpenalty of losing the war, another turn of the screw. >My friends were, they all said, little men; why should they repent those acts ofState (and of a dictatorship State in which they had no controlling voice) whichthe highest surviving ministers of the State did not repent? Repentance is notof the essence, or even of the atmosphere, of a legal proceeding anyway, stillless of a military proceeding. Repentance is effectively urged when the urgerstipulates inThe Crimes of the Losersthe indictment that we are all sinners, and the Nuremberg indictments made nosuch stipulation.If, after all the wars of history, the losers had not been roughly treatedwithout a formal finding of guilt, the treatment of the Germans after the lastwar, upon a formal finding, might have impressed my friends. As it was, theywere, in their own view, simply paying the usual price of losing. \"Why so muchmoney to hang us?\" said Goring to his neighbor in the dock when the Americanprosecutor, complaining at the trial's delays, said that the procedure wascosting his government thousands of dollars a day. Five irreparable years later,the man we sent to Germany to re-educate the Germans found himself re-educated:\"In looking backward/' said former High Commissioner Mc-Cloy, \"I wish we hadbeen able to erect tribunals not composed exclusively of the victors.\" Whyweren't we able to?In 1950, in October, United States General Douglas MacArthur approved a legalprocedure, modeled after Nuremberg, for trying North Korean and Chinese warcriminals after the war in Korea would be won. Legal teams scoured the Koreanpeninsula as far north as the Yalu River, accompanied by motion-picturephotographers. A year later the United Nations commander in Korea, GeneralMatthew Ridgway, said that there were 400 \"active cases and 126 suspects\" of warcrimes in UN custody. But a year later North Korean and Chinese war criminalswent home, untried and unhung; Secretary Dulles, an international lawyer,announced the good news, as he called it, that the North Korean-Chinese commandhad agreed to release enemy personnel charged with war crimes on the conditionthat the UN command release enemy personnel so charged. The \"rare moment inhistory\" had passed; the war inKorea had not been won; international law, like international conquest, requiredlosers before it could operate.Losers are hard to convince of their guilt. The suffering they have undergone inlosing constitutes, as they see it, expiation and more for their own offenses,real or alleged. Boys fighting in alleys are that way. The battered and bloodyvanquished is seldom magnanimous enough to admit that he got what was coming tohim—about all he can be got to say is \"uncle\"—and more seldom still to admitthat he ought to get more. Men should not be that way, but they sometimes are.My friends were.It is a principle of animal training that, for the punishment to be effective,the offender must associate it with the crime. You must catch him in the act, onthe scene, or he will have forgotten what he did and the punishment will appearabusive to him. Men, too, have a way of dating their guilt and innocence fromthe injuries they suffer, not from those they inflict. No matter how far back inhistory I went with my National Socialist friends, they would want to begin itswriting with their own or their country's agonies. When I spoke of 1939, theyspoke of 1945; when I spoke of 1914, they spoke of 1918; when I spoke of 1871,they spoke of 1809. As a university-educated American, I knew that there hadbeen a Dawes Plan for the payment of German reparations after the first WorldWar, and a Young Plan which had liberalized the payments. But seven of my tenfriends—five of whom had not gone beyond six years of folk school—knew that theYoung Plan payments were to have been continued until 1988, \"when,\" saidPoliceman Hofmeister, \"my son will be eighty years old.\"My fellow-Americans in Germany were sick of the Ger-The Crimes of the Losersmans' self-pity. \"I'll tell you about them/' said one of the Occupationofficials, \"in a nutshell. They're like dogs. If you don't kick them, they biteyou; and, when you kick them, they whine.\" An American Occupation judge wastrying to get transferred. \"It's got so,\" he said, \"that the minute a Germanstarts whining, I know I'm going to find him guilty. And they all whine. Theyall have a hard-luck story. Well, they have had hard luck. But they gave otherpeople lots harder luck first. Of course, they've forgotten that.\"The judge was equating inequivalents. The hard luck the Germans have had theyhave had, while the hard luck they gave, somebody else had, somebody they don'tknow; and they don't even believe that it was they who gave it. Herr Damm, afterlosing his career and his home and possessions, was now earning $47 a month as a\"black,\" that is, unauthorized worker; he did not see the equivalence betweenhis boycott of Jews in the past and his own children's undernourishment now. Hehadn't seen the Jews who, as the ultimate consequence of his legal acts wereslain; and, besides, like everyone else except Hitler, who had a mandate fromthe German people, Herr Damm had a mandate from Hitler, the head of thegovernment, to boycott Jews.I am sure that the tailor, Schwenke, had a hand, and a ready one, in burning theKronenberg synagogue. See the way he may see the crime (which he denies): He wasa man provoked to fury by extreme misfortune, in which \"the Jews\" played thecentral role; and he was one of many; and he was a follower, not a leader; andhe was being a patriot in Nazi Germany; and the victim was a building; and soon. And the loss to him (which he admits) was three years' imprisonment late inlife, his job,his health, his home, his possessions, and a chance to earn a living to keepfrom starving. Justice has not overtaken the spirit which led to the Nazienormities—how could it?— but it has overtaken Herr Schwenke, in his view, witha terrible vengeance.As my ten friends, all ten of them, told me their troubles, whining, whining,whining, I sympathized with the American complaint. One of the shoemakers inKronenberg, a man who bears the reputation, and justly so, of a philosopher,said, \"I was listening to a German-Swiss soccer game at Zurich, just before youcame in. The Swiss were being beaten, and it was near the end of the game. Thereseem to have been several fouls called on the German team in the course of thegame, and here was another. The Swiss announcer said, without raising his voice,Toul called on the visitors/ and went on. Do you know what a German announcerwould have done, if the situation were reversed and the game were in Germany?—Hewould have cried out, 'Another foul on the Swiss!\" and he would have made theword \"Swiss,\" Schweitzer, sound like \"pig,\" Schwein. He would have named theSwiss player who fouled, and he would have repeated the name, saying, 'ThisBaltz is the same Baltz who .. / and so on. You understand? That's our trouble.\"War seems to be the German sport—if not exclusively theirs—and the Germans seemto be poor sports. Baker Wedekind, without having read the ancient Romans, whomade the same point on the subject of the Germans, said, \"Churchill promised theEnglish 'blood and tears/ and at the very beginning of the war. That you wouldnever hear in Germany. You might hear it at the very end, and even then youwould hear that we were still winning. We won all the battles, you know; we onlylost the war. We are notThe Crimes of the Losersgood losers. I don't know about you. You have never lost, have you?\"Americans have not had the Germans' troubles, perhaps by happy accident, perhapsbecause they have not made such troubles for others as the Germans have.Americans are not injured, and they don't feel injured. And, if they do, they donot characteristically whine. There is an unbecoming childishness in all thiswhining, a childishness which is not mitigated by one's looking on one's self as\"little.\" An American may be helpless, but he doesn't know it. The stiff upperlip of the Englishman may be a national affectation, but he keeps it. TheseGermans, hitting out because somebody tells them to (or doesn't tell them notto), are offended when somebody hits them back. Sacrifice and endurance are morearduously cultivated among the Germans than among other peoples, with strangelymixed success.My Nazi friends were sorry for themselves because they were wrongfully injured.And they were wrongfully injured, you know; everyone is, in this life. And thereseems to be a much greater accumulation of wrongful injury—injury suffered, thatis, which weighs heavier than injury inflicted —in Germany than in places offthe path of the last twenty centuries' wars. So Germans whine. But there was thewoman who told me ? \"It was my own fault. I should have been more courageous\";and the man who said, \"I should have been man enough to say 'No' at the verybeginning\"; and the priest who stood on the scaffold after the unsuccessfulPutsch of 1944 and said to his confessor, \"In a minute, Father, I shall knowmore than you\"—these, too, were Germans.Being a German may make whining easier, but not inevitable. In October, 1945,the Confessional church ofGermany, the \"church within the Church\" which had defied Hitler's \"GermanChristians/' issued the \"Stuttgart Confession\": \"We know ourselves to be withour people in a great company of suffering, but also in a great solidarity ofguilt. With great pain do we say that through us has endless suffering beenbrought to many peoples and countries. That to which we have often borne witnessbefore our congregations, we declare in the name of the whole church. True, wehave struggled for many years in the name of Jesus Christ against a spirit whichhas found its terrible expression in the National Socialist regime of violence,but we accuse ourselves for not witnessing more courageously. .. .\" Those, too,were German words.The juridical effort at Nuremberg to punish the evildoers without injuring thelosers—when punishment and injury came to the same thing and the losers wereidentical with the evildoers—was unlikely enough to succeed. The effort toconvince my ten friends that they were evildoers was even unlikelier. Inretrospect, there was one extremely remote possibility of its having been donemore successfully in Germany than it had ever been done anywhere else: It mighthave been possible to exploit the Germans' attachment to \"the German spirit\" andto have convinced them that this spirit, instead of being good, is evil. How tohave gone about doing this I do not know. Certainly not by treating them hard;the Nazis used this technique on the Jews without convincing them of anything.CHAPTER 12\"That's the Way We Are\"There was a peculiar disadvantage in trying to convince the Germans generallythat they were guilty of the crimes of the Reich. The German people have never,as. single individuals, had to assume the responsibility of sovereignty overtheir government. The self-governing American regards his government as his mereagent, an animated tool in his hand. If it doesn't suit his purposes, hediscards it and tries a new one. He, the constituent, constitutes the State; hisministers minister to him. My Nazi—and most of my non-Nazi—friends in Germanysimply do not understand this view of government in which the enduring fact ofsociety, the will of the people, is represented by an instrument which is heretoday and gone tomorrow. The government must be embodied. To say that it isembodied in the law is, in their view, so much gobbledygook; laws are enacted bymen. (The Nazis did not even bother to repeal the Weimar Constitution.)The English constitutional monarchy, a monarchy they themselves never had, myfriends might comprehend, with the greatest difficulty; our constitutionaldemocracy, not at all. This seems to say that my friends want despotic rule.They do, if by despotism we mean, not the ruler's oppression, but the ruler'sindependent right to rule.This does not mean totalitarianism; it does not mean thatthere is no opposition. It means that the opposition is limited to matters belowthe level of general policy; Bismarck did not govern without the advice of theReichstag; he governed without its consent, as the Kaiser, when he finallychose, governed without Bismarck's. The story is told of the last emperor ofAustria-Hungary, the famous-visaged Franz Josef of the great white burnsides,that, having on one occasion received an Opposition delegation and heard itsdemands, he turned to his prime minister and said, \"This is not opposition—thisis factious opposition!\" My friend Willy Hofmeister, the policeman, who, nowthat I think of it, looked like Franz Josef, was telling me that a Germanpoliceman never used his gun except in cases of extreme personal peril. \"Well,\"I said, \"when you order a car to stop and it doesn't, don't you fire?\" \"Wewouldn't,\" he said, \"but when you order a car to stop, it stops.\" Opposition.The history of the Social Democratic Party of Germany is suggestive. In 1890 theKaiser, with Bismarck gone, let the anti-Socialist laws lapse. In a singlegeneration of legal status the Social Democratic Party transformed itself from arevolutionary underground to a governmental party, reformist, to be sure, evenradically reformist, but not, as it was in England and even in Austria, anopposition with an independent program of its own for altering the very basis ofgovernment.In 1914 the Socialists, supporting the Kaiser's demand for war credits,proclaimed that Germany was fighting a defensive war~-\"In the hour of danger, wewill not leave our country in the lurch.\" A generation later, after its countryhad left it in the lurch, the Party was even more nationalistic than theanti-Socialist coalition of the Adenauer government; \"never again,\" said theSocialist leader Schumacher,\"That's the Way We Are\"\"will the Socialists be caught being less nationalistic than theiropponents.\"—Thus they who of yore proclaimed \"the commonwealth of man and theparliament of the world.\"The formation of Germany's \"black\" army after 1918 had its sanction and supportfrom the Reich Ministry of War under the Socialist leadership of Severing, and,at the end of Wiemar, only the Prussian Socialist leadership stood firm inresistance. Like all the rest of the pre-Nazi parties in Germany, left, right,and center, the Social Democratic Party as such provided no independentalternative to the Nazis and the Communists, each of which parties was ready torule with a program of its own uninhibited by any atavistic subservience to thetradition of the suprapolitical Sovereign. \"There was one thing you had to sayfor the Bolsheviks,\" said the Nazi Fanatilcer Schwenke. \"Their 'No' wasn't athree-quarters Tes/ \"It hadn't always been that way. Just before the first World War one-fourth ofthe deputies in the Reichstag were Social Democrats, at a time whenparliamentary government was a rich man's game, with the deputies un-salaried;at a time, too, when to be a Social Democrat in Germany was almost as bad asbeing a Communist in the United States thirty years later. Regarded still inthose days, as they had been under Bismarck, as traitors, the future party ofloyal opposition fought to change the character of their country and the basisof its government. Their workingmen's education movement, although (unlike ourown adult programs) it was education for specific social purposes, was the mostadvanced and widespread in Europe. Their trade-unions, and the men in them, werepolitically conscious and aggressive; unlike American workers, who were bornwith civil rights, the German and all other European workers had had to fight towin theirs.Immediately prior to their turning respectable, at the outset of the first war,the German Social Democrats had been a force for fundamental change amongperhaps one-third of all the Germans. Respectability, which the Social Democratsfinally achieved by supporting the war government in 1914, killed that force andleft its vestiges to the Nazis and the Communists.Twice in our time, at Weimar and at Bonn, Germany's victorious enemies havetried to turn Germany upside down and install government (as my Nazi friends seeit) without rule. Hitler turned Germany (as they see it) right side up. He wasan independent Sovereign, popularly supported, in part for no other reason thanthat he was an independent Sovereign. This was government.Were the props to be pulled out from under it, the Bonn Republic would sooner orlater fall, as surely as Weimar, not because Germans find it oppressive butbecause they find it a nonregnum. The chancellor is a party politician at themercy of party politicians who, to the extent that they are responsible to thepeople, derive their power, and therefore his, from those creatures furthestremoved, in their own estimate, from Sovereignty. A fifty-year-old non-Naziacquaintance of mine remembered that, when she was a teen-ager, not in thefeudal east or imperial south of the country but in modern Westphalia, thefarmers took off their hats when the Count's carriage went by empty, andPoliceman Hofmeister told me, \"When all is said and done, it is cheaper to payone man, who knows how to rule, twenty million marks than to pay five thousandmen ten thousand marks apiece/'Chancellor Bismarck ruled Germany; he was the Chancellor of Iron. But theKing-Emperor could and did dismiss him, could and did use the independence ofthe\"That's the Way We Are\"Crown (which Bismarck, in his hatred of parliamentarian-ism, had fortified) tolaunch a mad attack upon Europe in what he regarded as the interest of theGerman people. He may have been wrong and Bismarck right, but the German people,who regarded him as the man whose business it was to rule them, fought when hetold them to. Neither Americans unlaureled nor English poets laureate believe(though the latter say) that it is not ours to reason why. But my Nazi, and someof my non-Nazi, friends believe it; \"the King makes war, and the people die.\"They are good soldiers, these Germans; they lack only what Bismarck (of allpeople) said they lacked, \"civilian courage/' the courage which enables menneither to be governed by nor to govern others but to govern themselves.This does not mean that my Nazi—or non-Nazi—friends are bad men. (They may bebad, but, if they are, it is for other reasons.) It means that their politicalhistory is different from ours—we should say \"behind\" ours. I put \"behind\" inquotation marks because my friends do not see it that way; they are less readythan we are to identify chronological change with progress. Without having readthe Greeks, they use all the arguments against democracy that the Greeks used.\"In your government,\" said the argumentative bill-collector, who wanted to talkabout America and had read about it in Luckner, \"nobody has authority. This is afine thing, to be sure, in a big, rich, empty land, unless there is anemergency. Then you suddenly establish authority. You boast that you haveelections even in wartime, but you never change governments then; then you say,'Don't change horses in the middle of the stream' (we have the same saying inGermany); and you don't. We don't pretend that we can.\"Nor does it mean that my Nazi—or non-Nazi—friendsare politically unconscious. Far from it; their conversation is more politicalthan ours, and they take their politics with what Schopenhauer called tierischerErnst, bovine seriousness. The German press devotes much more of its space thanours to politics and more of its political discussion to issues than topersonalities. In our first conversations, when I found that my friendspreferred talking about Versailles or the Polish Corridor to talking aboutthemselves, I thought that they were running away from their guilt. I was wrong.They did not regard what they themselves did as important, and they wereinterested in important things like Versailles and the Polish Corridor. •To say that my German friends were nonpolitical, and to say no more, is to libelthem. As in nearly all European countries, a very much larger proportion ofGermans than Americans turns out for political meetings, political discussions,and local and general elections. Where the German was (in contrast with theAmerican) nonpolitical was at a deeper level. He was habitually deficient in thesense of political power that the American possesses (and the Englishman, theFrenchman, the Scandinavian, and the Swiss). He saw the State in such majestyand magnificence, and himself in such insignificance, that he could not relatehimself to the actual operation of the State.One of my non-Nazi friends made a relevant point, however, in defense of hiscountrymen, at least against the Americans, if not against the rest of theEuropeans: \"Our situation differs from yours the way city life differs from thecountry. Ours is intensely complicated and difficult, sophisticated, so to say,while yours (at least until very recently) has been almost pastoral, primitivein its clarity and simplicity. Ours is much less readily intelligible to us thanyours is to you, and our 'average citizen/ therefore,\"That's the Way We Are\"feels more inadequate than yours to deal with it.\" But the nonpolitical, or,more accurately, politically nonconfident, German, who minded his own businessand confined his business to his Fach (which means both pigeonhole andspecialty), was just as prevalent in business, industry, and finance, ineducation, in the church, and in the press as in tailoring, baking, orcabinetmaking.The German universities were crawling with experts on the Akka pygmies of theAruwimi Congo, but they were closed to political thinking except on the level ofdetached theory; in the whole state of Hesse not a single course in politicalscience was offered. The German universities began their life with theology, andGerman theology began its life with the great bicker, theLuther-Melanchthon-Zwingli disputation over the Eucharist, which broke up withLuther's adherence to the literality of the words Hoc est corpus meum, which hecarved in great letters on the table at Marburg. The German church was out ofthis world; the social gospel did not enter German preaching, and preaching wasrigidly separated from theology (and prophecy from them both).The press, unlike the church and the universities, was not a state institution,but it was characteristically cautious and dull in a nation where the right tosuppress had never been overturned. The Frankfurter Zeitung, until it was pickedup by the LG. Farben trust in the 1920's, was a very conservative newspaper ofgreat cultural interest, and the provincial press lacked even cultural interestThe fact that the trade-unions were predominantly Social Democratic said nothingof breadth of the German worker; the leadership was as independent of themembership as it was in some of the more notorious unions in the United States;strikes in Germany were called, not voted; and theSocial Democratic workers, \"good citizens/' were absorbed, with almost noresistance, in the Nazi Labor Front. Outside the great business, industrial, andfinancial combines, which influenced public policy through court camarillas, theKaiserreich boss was no more politically alive than his worker. A member of thepre-Hitler Prussian cabinet, asked what caused Nazism, said: \"What caused Nazismwas the clubman in Berlin who, when he was asked about the Nazi menace in 1930,looked up from his after-lunch game of Skat and replied, 'Dafur ist dieRegierung da. That's what the government's there for.'\"Arguing with an American, you may ask him, with propriety, \"All right—what wouldyou have done if you had been President?\" You don't ask one of my Nazi friendswhat he would have done if he had been Fiihrer—or Emperor. The concept that thecitizen might become the actual Head of the State has no reality for my friends.Why not?—Didn't Hitler become the Head of the State? \"Not at all,\" said HerrSimon, the bill-collector, and then he went on to enlighten me on legitimacy.Hitler was appointed by the Head of the State. The true German ruler is themonarch. The first President of Germany, Ebert, was not elected by the people atall, and the second (and last), Hindenburg, was not really elected but waschosen by the German people as custodian for the monarchy. My friends, like allpeople to whom the present is unpalatable and the future unpromising, alwayslook back. Looking back, they see themselves ruled, and well ruled, by anindependent Sovereign. Their experience with even the outward forms ofself-government does not, as yet, incline them to it.The concept that the citizen actually is, as such, the Head of the State is, intheir view, nothing but self-contra-\"That's the Way We Are\"diction. I read to three of my friends a lecture I had prepared, in which I wasgoing to say that I was the highest official of the United States, holding theoffice of citizen. I had used the word Staatsbiirger. \"But that/' said allthree, in identical words, \"is no office at all.\" There we were. \"But it reallyis the highest office in America,\" I said; \"the citizen is the Sovereign. If Isay 'souveraner Staatsbiirger/ will that be clearer?\"\"Clearer, certainly/ 7 said Herr Kessler, the bank clerk, \"but wronger, if Imay, Herr Professor. Those two words do not go together. The idea is not aGerman idea. It says that the citizen is the ruler, but there are millions ofcitizens, so that would be anarchy. There could be no rule. A State must have aHead, not a million or fifty million or a hundred million Heads. If one of your'sovereign citizens' does not like a law, do you allow him to break it? If not,your 'sovereign citizen' is only a myth, and you are, like us, ruled by realrulers. But your theory does not admit it.\"\"We hear a lot about America,\" said Policeman Hof-meister, \"not only now, butall our lives we have heard a lot, because so many of us have relatives who havegone there. Now we always say in Germany, 'Monarchic oder Anarchic'; there isnothing in between, and Anarchie is mob rule. We have heard of your Americancities ruled by gangsters working with dishonest politicians who steal thepeople's money and give them poor service, bad roads, and such, charging themalways for good roads or good sewers. That we have never known here in Germany,not under the Kaiser, not under Hitler. That is a kind of Anarchie, maybe notmob rule but something like it.\"\"You think,\" said Herr Simon, who did not always re-member to call me Professor, \"that there is one kind of dictatorship, the kindwe had here. But you might have a dictatorship not by the best of your peoplebut by all, or a majority, of your people. Isn't that possible, too?\"\"I suppose so/' I said, \"but it is hard to believe. I should say that NationalSocialism had some of that in it, that dictatorship by the majority/'\"Yes/' said Herr Simon, \"but what about the law against drinking liquor that youhad in the United States. Wasn't that a majority dictatorship?\"I explained, and we went on, but my friend was trying to make a point. InTennessee a kind of legal mob rule forbade the teaching of evolution, inCalifornia (long afterward) it forbade the teaching of internationalism asmanifested in UNESCO. My Nazi friend Simon had not heard of John Stuart Mill,the philosopher of liberty, who was worried about \"the tyranny of the majority/'or of Alexander Hamilton's staggering dictum, \"Your Teople/ Sir, is a greatbeast/'I think it is unfair to say that my friends are irresponsible, at least withoutadding that irresponsibility, which is a moral failure, may be at least in parta consequence of nonresponsibility, which is historical fact. There is adistinction between \"unconscionable\" and \"conscienceless.\" The model of theconscienceless pattern of German behavior was (and is) the civil service, whosesecurity and status are the dream of the \"little man\" in a world where, even ingood times, to lose a job is a dreadful prospect. The magnificence of the Germancivil service is one side of the coin; the training and elevation of a wholeconscienceless class of citizens, who hear nothing, see nothing, and say nothingundutiful, the other. The apprenticeship of a Beamte, a\"That's the Way We Are\"civil servant, is hard and long, and the man who is seen to do his dutyreluctantly or squeamishly is never certified; he is kept on as Angestellte,employee. German bank employees, who are not Beamten, call themselvesBanfcbeam-ten, simply to swell their little pride.This immense hierarchism, based upon blind servility in which the man on thethird rung would never dare to imagine that the man on the second would orderhim to do something wrong, since, after all, the man on the second had to answerto the man on the first, nourished the buck-passing instinct to fantasticproportions. 'If/' said a friend of mine whose sense of humor was surprising(\"for a German\"), \"you ask the postman whether he thinks it will rain tomorrow(and tomorrow is the day of the Communist parade, and the Communists areillegal), he will excuse himself while he gets his immediate superior'spermission to answer, and his superior will take the question up throughchannels until it reaches an official whose sense of independent moralresponsibility is so strong that he dares to lose the question rather than sendit on higher. By the time the postman is able to tell you that he has no opinionon the matter, it is day after tomorrow/'Men who learn to live this way get used to it and even get to like it. It isworkable, too; good discipline produces, at least in limited areas, the sameperformance as good self-discipline. The only objection to the scheme is thatmen who always do as they're told do not know what to do when they're not.Without the thoughtful habit of decision, they decide (when they must decide forthemselves) thoughtlessly. If they are forbidden to beat Jews, they learn hownot to want to, something a free manwho wants to beat Jews never learns; then, when they are allowed to, the releaseof their repressed wish to beat Jews makes maniacs of them.All Germans are not \"authoritarian personalities.\" I imagine that most are not.But, while there have been intervals in which the German was actually allowed toconcern himself with matters of State, the pattern of German life has been such,over the centuries, that free spirits either had to give up or get out. FromGoethe, who said he preferred \"injustice to disorder/' to Thomas Mann, whogloried in being nonpolitical, German intellectuals contrived to live \"above itall,\" in \"the land of poets and thinkers,\" as Mme de Stael described the Germanyof 1810. Those who contrived to live in it all fared badly.Other nations sent their worst people away. Germany sent—drove, rather—its best.Between Prince Metternich's Mainz Commission of 1819 (the Un-German ActivitiesCommittee of its day) and the last renewal of Bismarck's anti-Socialist laws in1888, some four and a half million Germans came to the United States alone,770,000 of them after the suppression of the Revolution of 1848. Wave afterwave, after each unsuccessful movement against autocracy, came over toconstitute, wherever they went, the finest flower of immigration. Their lettersback home brought new and larger waves of their friends and relatives, who were,in large measure, moved more by economic opportunity than by political hope ornecessity—who, however, belonged to families or circles in which politicalliberalism had led to emigration. Left behind were, in the main, those whoconformed, willingly or because they saw no way out. Left behind, too, for thenext generation, was the dream, always madder as it was frustrated, which\"That's the Way We Are\"produced new outbreaks, new suppressions, new emigrations. National Socialismbrought dream and conformism together into something satanic.Each new generation's leadership was somewhere in Pennsylvania or the Argentineor Wisconsin or China. But millions of liberty-loving Germans remained, and allmen, in whatever form they love it, love liberty. Thus throughout Germany, aseverywhere where there is oppression among literate peoples, one encountered,and still encounters, more diversity, more individuality, than there is among,say, Americans, who are unoppressed; more variety in entertainment and in thearts, in political partisanship and in the political complexion of the press;all this, more individuality, more independence, stubborn or sublimated, in theland of the goose step than one finds in the land of the free. Free Americansall read the same papers, wear the same clothes, and vote for the same twotransposable parties; Germans dress freely, freely read different papers, andvote a dozen different ways, but they are, in their submissiveness, the same.Of what are these people guilty, who have never known the responsibility of thesovereign citizen? Of not assuming it, all at once, on January 30, 1933? Theiroffense was their national history. The crime of all but a million or so of them(and, in part, of these, too) had been committed long before National Socialism.All ten of my friends gladly confess this crime of having been Germans inGermany.'That's the way we Germans are,\" said Herr Simon, the alter Kampfer.\"But/' I said, \"is this the Herrenrasse, the superior race?\"\"Morally and mentally, yes,\" he said. \"We are industrious and orderly, too. Butwe are unfortunate in thisone respect: we cannot rule ourselves; wir brauchen eine starlce Hand, werequire an iron hand/' \"Why?\"\"I don't know. That's the way we Germans are/* It is partly self-pity again,partly, of course, self-exculpation, the easy way out. My friends may notpresent an admirable spectacle. But failure to present an admirable spectacle isnot a crime against humanity. Maybe it should be.CHAP TER 13But Then It Was Too Late\"What no one seemed to notice/' said a colleague of mine, a philologist, \"wasthe ever widening gap, after 1933, between the government and the people. Justthink how very wide this gap was to begin with, here in Germany. And it becamealways wider. You know, it doesn't make people close to their government to betold that this is a people's government, a true democracy, or to be enrolled incivilian defense, or even to vote. All this has little, really nothing, to dowith knowing one is governing.\"What happened here was the gradual habituation of the people, little by little,to being governed by surprise; to receiving decisions deliberated in secret; tobelieving that the situation was so complicated that the government had to acton information which the people could not understand, or so dangerous that, evenif the people could understand it, it could not be released because of nationalsecurity. And their sense of identification with Hitler, their trust in him,made it easier to widen this gap and reassured those who would otherwise haveworried about it.\"This separation of government from people, this widening of the gap, took placeso gradually and so insensibly, each step disguised (perhaps not evenintentionally) as a temporary emergency measure or associated with truepatriotic allegiance or with real social purposes. And allthe crises and reforms (real reforms, too) so occupied the people that they didnot see the slow motion underneath, of the whole process of government growingremoter and remoter.\"You will understand me when I say that my Middle High German was my life. Itwas all I cared about. I was a scholar, a specialist. Then, suddenly, I wasplunged into all the new activity, as the university was drawn into the newsituation; meetings, conferences, interviews, ceremonies, and, above all, papersto be filled out, reports, bibliographies, lists, questionnaires. And on top ofthat were the demands in the community, the things in which one had to, was'expected to' participate that had not been there or had not been importantbefore. It was all rigmarole, of course, but it consumed all one's energies,coming on top of the work one really wanted to do. You can see how easy it was,then, not to think about fundamental things. One had no time/'\"Those,\" I said, \"are the words of my friend the baker. \"One had no time tothink. There was so much going on.\"\"Your friend the baker was right,\" said my colleague. \"The dictatorship, and thewhole process of its coming into being, was above all diverting. It provided anexcuse not to think for people who did not want to think anyway. I do not speakof your little men/ your baker and so on; I speak of my colleagues and myself,learned men, mind you. Most of us did not want to think about fundamental thingsand never had. There was no need to. Nazism gave us some dreadful, fundamentalthings to think about—we were decent people—and kept us so busy with continuouschanges and 'crises' and so fascinated, yes, fascinated, by the machinations ofthe 'national enemies/ without and within, that we had no time to think aboutthese dreadful"},{"pageContent":"But Then It Was Too Latethings that were growing, little by little, all around us. Unconsciously, Isuppose, we were grateful. Who wants to think?'To live in this process is absolutely not to be able to notice it—please try tobelieve me—unless one has a much greater degree of political awareness, acuity,than most of us had ever had occasion to develop. Each step was so small, soinconsequential, so well explained or, on occasion, 'regretted/ that, unless onewere detached from the whole process from the beginning, unless one understoodwhat the whole thing was in principle, what all these little measures' that no'patriotic German' could resent must some day lead to, one no more saw itdeveloping from day to day than a farmer in his field sees the corn growing. Oneday it is over his head.\"How is this to be avoided, among ordinary men, even highly educated ordinarymen? Frankly, I do not know. I do not see, even now. Many, many times since itall happened I have pondered that pair of great maxims, Prin-cipiis obsta andFinem respice—'Resist the beginnings' and 'Consider the end/ But one mustforesee the end in order to resist, or even see, the beginnings. One mustforesee the end clearly and certainly and how is this to be done, by ordinarymen or even by extraordinary men?

And then they attackedthe Church, and he was a Churchman, and he did something— but then it was toolate/'\"Yes,\" I said.\"You see,\" my colleague went on, \"one doesn't see exactly where or how to move.Believe me, this is true. Each act, each occasion, is worse than the last, butonly a little worse. You wait for the next and the next. You wait for one greatshocking occasion, thinking that others, when such a shock comes, will join withyou in resisting somehow. You don't want to act, or even talk, alone; you don'twant to 'go out of your way to make trouble/ Why not?— Well, you are not in thehabit of doing it And it is not just fear, fear of standing alone, thatrestrains you; it is also genuine uncertainty.\"Uncertainty is a very important factor, and, instead of decreasing as time goeson, it grows. Outside, in the streets, in the general community, 'everyone' ishappy. One hears no protest, and certainly sees none. You know, in France orItaly there would be slogans against the government painted on walls and fences;in Germany, outside the great cities, perhaps, there is not even this. In theuniversity community, in your own community, you speak privately to yourcolleagues, some of whom certainly feel as you do; but what do they say? Theysay, It's not so bad' or 'You're seeing things' or 'You're an alarmist/\"And you are an alarmist. You are saying that this mustBut Then It Was Too Latelead to this, and you can't prove it. These are the beginnings, yes; but how doyou know for sure when you don't know the end, and how do you know ? or evensurmise, the end? On the one hand, your enemies, the law, the regime, the Party,intimidate you. On the other, your colleagues pooh-pooh you as pessimistic oreven neurotic. You are left with your close friends, who are, naturally, peoplewho have always thought as you have.\"But your friends are fewer now. Some have drifted off somewhere or submergedthemselves in their work. You no longer see as many as you did at meetings orgatherings. Informal groups become smaller; attendance drops off in littleorganizations, and the organizations themselves wither. Now, in small gatheringsof your oldest friends, you feel that you are talking to yourselves, that youare isolated from the reality of things. This weakens your confidence stillfurther and serves as a further deterrent to—to what? It is clearer all the timethat, if you are going to do anything, you must make an occasion to do it, andthen you are obviously a troublemaker. So you wait, and you wait.\"But the one great shocking occasion, when tens or hundreds or thousands willjoin with you, never comes. That's the difficulty. If the last and worst act ofthe whole regime had come immediately after the first and smallest, thousands,yes, millions would have been sufficiently shocked —if, let us say, the gassingof the Jews in '43 had come immediately after the 'German Firm' stickers on thewindows of non-Jewish shops in '33. But of course this isn't the way it happens.In between come all the hundreds of little steps, some of them imperceptible,each of them preparing you not to be shocked by the next. Step C is not so muchworse than Step B, and, if you did not make astand at Step B, why should you at Step C? And so on to Step D.\"And one day, too late, your principles, if you were ever sensible of them, allrush in upon you. The burden of self-deception has grown too heavy, and someminor incident, in my case my little boy, hardly more than a baby, saying 'Jewswine/ collapses it all at once, and you see that everything, everything, haschanged and changed completely under your nose. The world you live in—yournation, your people—is not the world you were born in at all. The forms are allthere, all untouched, all reassuring, the houses, the shops, the jobs, themealtimes, the visits, the concerts, the cinema, the holidays. But the spirit,which you never noticed because you made the lifelong mistake of identifying itwith the forms, is changed. Now you live in a world of hate and fear, and thepeople who hate and fear do not even know it themselves; when everyone istransformed, no one is transformed. Now you live in a system which rules withoutresponsibility even to God. The system itself could not have intended this inthe beginning, but in order to sustain itself it was compelled to go all theway.\"You have gone almost all the way yourself. Life is a continuing process, aflow, not a succession of acts and events at all. It has flowed to a new level,carrying you with it, without any effort on your part. On this new level youlive, you have been living more comfortably every day, with new morals, newprinciples. You have accepted things you would not Lave accepted five years ago,a year ago, things that your father, even in Germany, could not have imagined.\"Suddenly it all comes down, all at once. You see what you are, what you havedone, or, more accurately, what you haven't done (for that was all that wasrequired ofBut Then It Was Too Latemost of us: that we do nothing). You remember those early meetings of yourdepartment in the university when, if one had stood, others would have stood,perhaps, but no one stood.

You are compromised beyond repair.\"What then? You must then shoot yourself. A few did. Or 'adjust' yourprinciples. Many tried, and some, I suppose, succeeded; not I, however. Or learnto live the rest of your life with your shame. This last is the nearest thereis, under the circumstances, to heroism: shame. Many Germans became this poorkind of hero, many more, I think, than the world knows or cares to know.\"I said nothing. I thought of nothing to say.\"I can tell you/' my colleague went on, \"of a man in Leipzig, a judge. He wasnot a Nazi, except nominally, but he certainly wasn't an anti-Nazi. He wasjust—a judge. In ? 42 or '43, early '43, I think it was, a Jew was tried beforehim in a case involving, but only incidentally, relations with an 'Aryan' woman.This was 'race injury/ something the Party was especially anxious to punish. Inthe case at bar, however, the judge had the power to convict the man of a'nonraciaF offense and send him to an ordinary prison for a very long term, thussaving him from Party 'processing' which would have meant concentration camp or,more probably, deportation and death. But the man was innocent of the'nonracial' charge, in the judge's opinion, and so, as an honorable judge, heacquitted him. Of course, the Party seized the Jew as soon as he left thecourtroom.\"\"And the judge?\"\"Yes, the judge. He could not get the case off his conscience—a case, mind you,in which he had acquitted aninnocent man. He thought that he should have convicted him and saved him fromthe Party, but how could he have convicted an innocent man? The thing preyed onhim more and more, and he had to talk about it, first to his family, then to hisfriends, and then to acquaintances. (That's how I heard about it) After the '44Putsch they arrested him. After that, I don't know.\"I said nothing.\"Once the war began/' my colleague continued, \"resistance, protest, criticism,complaint, all carried with them a multiplied likelihood of the greatestpunishment Mere lack of enthusiasm, or failure to show it in public, was'defeatism/ You assumed that there were lists of those who would be 'dealt with'later, after the victory.

And he meant it; that was not justpropaganda. And that was enough to put an end \\6 all uncertainty.\"Once the war began, the government could do anything 'necessary' to win it; soit was with the 'final solution of the Jewish problem/ which the Nazis alwaystalked about but never dared undertake, not even the Nazis, until war and its'necessities' gave them the knowledge that they could get away with it. Thepeople abroad who thought that war against Hitler would help the Jews werewrong. And the people in Germany who, once the war had begun, still thought ofcomplaining, protesting, resisting, were betting on Germany's losing the war. Itwas a long bet. Not many made it\"CHAPTER 14Collective ShameMy colleague came back, one day, to the subject of \"this poor kind of heroism:shame/' \"The trouble with shame/' he said, \"is that it goes down deep or itdoesn't If it doesn't, one throws it off as soon as he himself is injured (as,of course, in total war, he is likely to be, in his family, his property, hisposition, his person). If it does, if it goes down deep enough, it is a form ofsuicide; it was this that led some men I knew to join the Party later on, an actof throwing themselves away. None of your 'little men,' perhaps-\"\"No, not shame,\" I said.\"But one doesn't know this easily,\" said my colleague, \"this deep shame. Withmany it took the outward form of their saying that, since National Socialistrule was here, and here for a long time to come, they would join it and reformit from within. But to be effective, they would first have to be accepted—\"\"Oh, 'effectiveness,'\" I said. \"That I heard from my friend the teacher. For thesake of being effective he did everything required of him, and of course hewasn't effective. He knows that now. But then he had hopes of being able tooppose the excesses—\"\"Yes, it was always the excesses that we wished to oppose, rather than the wholeprogram, the whole spirit thatproduced the first steps, A, B, C, and D, out of which the excesses were boundto come. It is so much easier to 'oppose the excesses/ about which one can, ofcourse, do nothing, than it is to oppose the whole spirit, about which one cando something every day.\"\"All of my 'little men' opposed the excesses, at least the worst excesses/' Isaid, \"and the two best of them, the teacher and the bank clerk, blamed them onthe radicals who had grown up in the movement when it was irresponsible andattracted the most reckless elements—\"\"Yes/' said my colleague, shaking his head, \"the 'excesses' and the 'radicals/We all opposed them, very quietly. So your two 'little men' thought they mustjoin, as good men, good Germans, even as good Christians, and when enough ofthem did they would be able to change the Party. They would 'bore from within/'Big men' told themselves that, too, in the usual sincerity that required themonly to abandon one little principle after another, to throw away, little bylittle, all that was good. I was one of those men.\"You know/' he went on, \"when men who understand what is happening—the motion,that is, of history, not the reports of single events or developments—when suchmen do not object or protest, men who do not understand cannot be expected to.How many men would you say understand—in this sense—in America? And when, as themotion of history accelerates and those who don't understand are crazed by fear,as our people were, and made into a great 'patriotic' mob, will they understandthen, when they did not before?\"We learned here—I say this freely—to give up trying to make them understandafter, oh, the end of 1938, after the night of the synagogue burning and thethings thatCollective Shamefollowed it. Even before the war began, men who were teachers, men whose faithin teaching was their whole faith, gave up, seeing that there was nocomprehension, no capacity left for comprehension, and the thing must go itscourse, taking first its victims, then its architects, and then the rest of usto destruction. This did not mean surrender; it meant conservation of energy,doing what little one could (now that it was too late to do anything!) andconsuming one's energy doing it, to relieve the present victim (if only bybrazenly saying 'Hello' to him on the street!) and to prevent, or at leastpostpone, the fate of the next victim (if only by writing a 'nonpolitical'letter abroad asking somebody to take an emigrant!).\"\"Yes,\" I said.\"You say that is not much\"~I tried to protest—\"but I say that it is more, underthe circumstances, than ordinary life, in Germany, in America, anywhere, hasprepared ordinary men to do.\"His wife was there. \"I hope,\" she said, \"that the Anglo-Saxons\"—she obviouslymeant the Anglos and not the Saxons—\"have characteristics that will make themless susceptible to the things we Germans could not resist.\"\"What would such characteristics be?\" I said.\"Oh, farsightedness, I think, above all. Maybe a shorter history makes it easierfor people to look ahead instead of always behind. And you are under lesspressure, somehow, than we are. You are freer—I don't mean legally, of course—totake the long view.\" It was the first time, in my conversations in Germany, thatthe focus had been placed on the word Druct, \"pressure.\"Another colleague of mine brought me even closer to the heart of the matter—andcloser home. A chemical engineer by profession, he was a man of whom, before Iknew him, I had been told, \"He is one of those rare birds among Germans—aEuropean/' One day, when we had become very friendly, I said to him, \"Tell menow—how was the world lost?\"\"That/' he said, \"is easy to tell, much easier than you may suppose. The worldwas lost one day in 1935, here in Germany. It was I who lost it, and I will tellyou how.\"I was employed in a defense plant (a war plant, of course, but they were alwayscalled defense plants). That was the year of the National Defense Law, the lawof \"total conscription/ Under the law I was required to take the oath offidelity. I said I would not; I opposed it in conscience. I was giventwenty-four hours to 'think it over/ In those twenty-four hours I lost theworld/'\"Yes?\" I said.\"You see, refusal would have meant the loss of my job, of course, not prison oranything like that. (Later on, the penalty was worse, but this was only 1935.)But losing my job would have meant that I could not get another. Wherever I wentI should be asked why I left the job I had, and, when I said why, I shouldcertainly have been refused employment. Nobody would hire a 'Bolshevik/ Ofcourse I was not a Bolshevik, but you understand what I mean/'\"Yes,\" I said.\"I tried not to think of myself or my family. We might have got out of thecountry, in any case, and I could have got a job in industry or educationsomewhere else.\"What I tried to think of was the people to whom I might be of some help lateron, if things got worse (as I believed they would). I had a wide friendship inscientific and academic circles, including many Jews, and 'Aryans/ too, whomight be in trouble. If I took the oath and held my job, I might be of help,somehow, as things went on.Collective ShameIf I refused to take the oath, I would certainly be useless to my friends, evenif I remained in the country. I myself would be in their situation.\"The next day, after 'thinking it over/ I said I would take the oath with themental reservation that, by the words with which the oath began, *Ich schworebei Gott, I swear by God/ I understood that no human being and no government hadthe right to override my conscience. My mental reservations did not interest theofficial who administered the oath. He said, 'Do you take the oath?' and I tookit. That day the world was lost, and it was I who lost it.\"\"Do I understand/' I said, \"that you think that you should not have taken theoath?\"\"Yes.\"\"But,\" I said, \"you did save many lives later on. You were of greater use toyour friends than you ever dreamed you might be/' (My friend's apartment was,until his arrest and imprisonment in 1943, a hideout for fugitives.)\"For the sake of the argument/' he said, \"I will agree that I saved many liveslater on. Yes,\"\"Which you could not have done if you had refused to take the oath in 1935.\"\"Yes.\"\"And you still think that you should not have taken the oath,\"\"Yes.\"\"I don't understand,\" I said.\"Perhaps not,\" he said, \"but you must not forget that you are an American. Imean that, really. Americans have never known anything like this experience—inits entirety, all the way to the end. That is the point.\"\"You must explain,\" I said.\"Of course I must explain. First of all, there is the problem of the lesserevil. Taking the oath was not so evil as being unable to help my friends lateron would have been. But the evil of the oath was certain and immediate, and thehelping of my friends was in the future and therefore uncertain. I had to commita positive evil, there and then, in the hope of a possible good later on. Thegood outweighed the evil; but the good was only a hope, the evil a fact/ 7\"But/' I said, \"the hope was realized. You were able to help your friends/'\"Yes/ 7 he said, \"but you must concede that the hope might not have beenrealized—either for reasons beyond my control or because I became afraid lateron or even because I was afraid all the time and was simply fooling myself whenI took the oath in the first place.\"But that is not the important point. The problem of the lesser evil we all knowabout; in Germany we took Hindenburg as less evil than Hitler, and in the end wegot them both. But that is not why I say that Americans cannot understand. No,the important point is—how many innocent people were killed by the Nazis, wouldyou say? 77\"Six million Jews alone, we are told/ 7\"Well, that may be an exaggeration. And it does not include non-Jews, of whomthere must have been many hundreds of thousands, or even millions. Shall we say,just to be safe, that three million innocent people were killed all together?\"I nodded.\"And how many innocent lives would you like to say I saved? 7 '\"You would know better than I/ 7 1 said.Collective Shame\"Well/' said he, \"perhaps five, or ten, one doesn't know. But shall we say ahundred, or a thousand, just to be safe?\"I nodded,\"And it would be better to have saved all three million, instead of only ahundred, or a thousand?\"\"Of course/'\"There, then, is my point. If I had refused to take the oath of fidelity, Iwould have saved all three million.\"\"You are joking,\" I said.\"No.\"\"You don't mean to tell me that your refusal would have overthrown the regime in1935?\"\"No.\"\"Or that others would have followed your example?\"\"No.\"\"I don't understand.\"\"You are an American,\" he said again, smiling. \"I will explain. There I was, in1935, a perfect example of the kind of person who, with all his advantages inbirth, in education, and in position, rules (or might easily rule) in anycountry. If I had refused to take the oath in 1935, it would have meant thatthousands and thousands like me, all over Germany, were refusing to take it.Their refusal would have heartened millions. Thus the regime would have beenoverthrown, or, indeed, would never have come to power in the first place. Thefact that I was not prepared to resist, in 1935, meant that all the thousands,hundreds of thousands, like me in Germany were also unprepared, and each one ofthese hundreds of thousands was, like me, a man of great influence or of greatpotential influence. Thus the world was lost.\"\"You are serious?\" I said.\"Completely,\" he said. \"These hundred lives I saved—or a thousand or ten as you will—what do they represent? A little something outof the whole terrible evil, when, if my faith had been strong enough in 1935, Icould have prevented the whole evil/'\"Your faith?\"\"My faith. I did not believe that I could 'remove mountains/ The day I said 'No/I had faith. In the process of 'thinking it over/ in the next twenty-four hours,my faith failed me. So, in the next ten years, I was able to remove onlyanthills, not mountains/'\"How might your faith of that first day have been sustained?\"\"I don't know, I don't know,\" he said. \"Do you?\"\"I am an American,\" I said.My friend smiled. \"Therefore you believe in education.\"\"Yes,\" I said.\"My education did not help me,\" he said, \"and I had a broader and bettereducation than most men have had or ever will have. All it did, in the end, wasto enable me to rationalize my failure of faith more easily than I might havedone if I had been ignorant. And so it was, I think, among educated mengenerally, in that time in Germany. Their resistance was no greater than othermen's.\"As I thought of my ten Nazi friends in the light of my talks with thephilologist and the engineer, it occurred to me that the concept of collectiveguilt is at bottom a semantic failure. What is really involved is collectiveshame. Collective shame may be possible, but it cannot be compelled. Shame is astate of being, guilt a juridical fact. A passer-by cannot be guilty of failureto try to prevent a lynching. He can only be ashamed of not having done so.Even a sovereign, self-governing citizen, such as an Amer-Collective Shameican, cannot be guilty of failure to try to prevent an act of State. It would beNazism itself to take Americans off the street and charge them, in connectionwith, say, the bombing of Hiroshima, with having violated the Hague Regulations,to which their government, whose sovereign citizens they are, was signatory.Still less than a sovereign citizen can the subject of a dictatorship be guiltyof an act of State. And, when the State requires him, personally andindividually, to commit what he regards as a crime, and the penalty for hisrefusal to do so is very heavy, the common law acquits him on the ground ofduress. \"I was lucky,\" said Herr Klingelhofer, the cabinetmaker. \"I didn't haveto do anything wrong/'Collective shame is something else, but it requires not merely the fact ofsovereign citizenship but the most delicate sense of it I did not discover muchcollective shame among my ten friends. The President of the West German FederalRepublic had called upon them to feel it and had used that very expression,\"collective shame.\" But how does one call, effectively, upon people to feelashamed?In the case of Horst Rupprecht, the university student and Hitler Youth leader,who blamed himself for the sins of Nazism, the sins of Germany, the sins of thewhole German people, his mea culpa was just a little unconvincing: he was eightyears old in 1933.1 think his testimony is what many non-Germans wanted to hearfrom the lips of every German: \"No, no, it wasn't Hitler and Goring and therest, it was we Germans, every one of us, I more than any of the rest, who didit\"; but I think they would have been disappointed when they heard it, as I was.At his trial at Nuremberg, young Rupprecht's highest superior, Baldur vonSchirach, the Nazi Youth Leader, said: \"It is my guilt, and I must bear itbefore God and the Ger-man nation, that I educated German youth for a man whom I thoughtirreproachable, but who was a murderer millions of times over.\" Was this thesame Baldur von Schirach who had called Hitler \"Germany's greatest son/' \"thisgenius grazing the stars/' who had said that the altar was not in the Church buton the steps of the Feldherrn Hall, where Hitler's Putsch had ended in 1923? Itwas. When, where, and how does one discover that an irreproachable man is amurderer millions of times over? Does it take the hangman's hood on his eyes toopen them?What I found, among my ten friends, was something like regret, regret thatthings, which they had not done, had been done or had had to be done. All ten ofthem, even the tailor, I think, felt bad, now, about the torture and slaughterof innocent people—not, however, about the deportation, \"resettlement,relocation,\" or even about the expropriation. (My friends had all lost their ownpossessions, hadn't they, and who but they themselves felt sorry for them?) Thesix extremists all said of the extermination of Jews, \"That was wrong\" or \"Thatwas going too far,\" as if to say, \"The gas oven was somewhat too great apunishment for people who, after all, deserved very great punishment.\"My ten friends had been told, not since 1939 but since 1933, that their nationwas fighting for its life. They believed that self-preservation is the first lawof nature, of the nature of nations as well as of herd brutes. Were they wrongin this principle? If they were, they saw nothing in the history of nations(their own or any other) that said so. And, once there was shooting war, theirsituation was like that of the secret opponents of the regime whom my colleaguedescribed: there was no further need for the nation, or anyone in it, to bejustified. The nation was literallyCollective Shamefighting for its literal life—\"they or we/' Anything went, and what \"anything' 7was, what enormities it embraced, depended entirely on the turn of the battle.Even Herr Schwenke, the tailor, proud of his having refused a Jew of oldacquaintance a light for his cigarette, frankly glad that the synagogue had beenburned, said of the gas ovens, \"If it happened, it was wrong. But I don'tbelieve it happened/' And, if he were ever able to admit that it did happen, hewould havd to admit that it was right and, to prove it, cry out, with his woundrubbed raw, in still greater anguish against the victims and ascribe to themsins even he had not yet been able to dream of.What we don't like, what I don't like, is the hypocrisy of these people. I wantto hear them confess. That they, or some of their countrymen and their country'sgovernment, violated the precepts of Christian, civilized, lawful life was badenough; that they won't see it, or say it, is what really rowels. I want them toplead no extenuation. I want them to say, \"I knew and I know that it was allun-Christian, uncivilized, unlawful, and in my love of evil I pretended itwasn't. I plead every German guilty of a life of hypocrisy, above all, myself. Iam rotten.\"I don't like the dolorous mask my friend Klingelhofer wears when he says, \"Ialways said no good would come of it, and no good did come of it.\" Hisfreiwillige Feuerwehr ebullience is suddenly gone, and now he emerges from thewings, like a one-man troupe playing Moli£re, in judicious melancholy. I want tosay to him, \"You Schweinehund, what you said, and you said it to yourself, wasthat no good would come of it if it lost. And it did lose. If it had won, you'dbe drinking blood with the rest of them.\" But what's the use?I want my friends not just to feel bad and confess it, but to have been bad andto be bad now and confess it. I want them to constitute themselves an inferiorrace, self-abased, so that I, in the magnanimity becoming to the superior,having sat in calumnious judgment on them, may choose to let them live on inpublic shame and in private torment. I want to be God, not alone in power but inrighteousness and in mercy; and Nazism crushed is my chance.But I am not God. I myself am a national, myself guilty of many nationalhypocrisies whose only justification is that the Germans' were so much worse. Mybeing less bestial, in my laws and practices, than they were does not make memore Godly than they, for difference in degree is not difference in kind. My owncountry's racist legislation and practices, against both foreigners andcitizens, is a whole web of hypocrisies. And, if I plead that racism has beenwonderfully reduced in America in the past century, that the forces of good havebeen growing ever more powerful, how shall I answer my friends Hildebrandt andKessler, who believed, or affected to believe, that the infiltration of NationalSocialism by decent men like themselves would, in time, reduce and eveneliminate the evils?The trouble is that these national hypocrisies, which I myself am not calledupon to practice in person, with my own hands, are all acts of the State or itsculture. I feel bad about them, to be sure; very bad. But I do not in the leastfeel like a bad man, and I do not want to be punished for them. And, if I beatmy breast, like my Nazi friend, young Rupprecht, and say, \"It is I, I, I, whodid it,\" I am afraid that I shall sound just as pretentious as he sounded to me.The confession that I want to hear or that I ought to make does not ring real.What I really want, since (while I want to let my friendsCollective Shameoff in my magnanimity) I do not want to have to reproach myself some time laterwith having let them escape the consequences of their unheroism, is for each ofthem to have cared enough at the time to have thrown himself under the ironchariot of the State, with its wheels rimmed with spikes. This none of myfriends did, and this I cannot forgive them. They did not care enough.CHAP TER 15The Furies: Hcimich HildcbrandtHow was I to know, or to find out, how much my friends had suffered (if they hadsuffered at all) or whether they had suffered enough? If, as doctrine has it,man is perfected by suffering, none of my friends had suffered enough, for noneof them, I could see, even in my imperfect knowledge of them, was perfect.Seven of them ducked my question. My question, which I framed very carefully andput to them in a variety of ways in the last weeks of our conversations, was,\"What did you do that was wrong, as you understand right and wrong, and whatdidn't you do that was right?\" The instinct that throws instant ramparts aroundthe self-love of all of us came into immediate operation; my friends, inresponse, spoke of what was legal or illegal, or what was popular or unpopular,or what others did or didn't do, or what was provoked or unprovoked. But I wasinterested, at this point, in none of these things. \"Who knows the secretheart?\" I was trying to know the secret heart; I knew all about Versailles andthe Polish Corridor and the inflation, the unemployment, the Communists, theJews, and the Talmud.The eighth of my friends, young Rupprecht, the Hitler Youth leader, having takenupon himself (or having affected to take) sovereign responsibility for everyfirst and last injustice of the whole Hitler regime, was no better ableto enlighten me than Herr Schwenke, the old Fanatiker, who, when I was at lastable to divert him, with my insistent last question, from Versailles, the PolishCorridor, etc., said, \"I have never done anything wrong to any man.\" \"Never?\"said I, just to hear myself say it. \"Never,\" said he, just to hear himself sayit. But two of my friends, Herr Hilde-brandt, the teacher, and Herr Kessler, thebank clerk, enlightened me, in their own time, in their own ways, without myhaving asked them my question.Fear and advantage, Hildebrandt had said, were his reasons for becoming aNational Socialist in 1937, a late \"March violet\" indeed. \"Were there,\" I said,on another occasion, \"any other reasons you joined?\" He said nothing and thenbegan to blush. \"I—,\" he began, blushing fully, and then he said, \"No, noothers.\" It was a long time before I learned all Herr Hildebrandt's reasons forbeing a Nazi.\"I might have got by without joining,\" he said more than once. \"I don't know. Imight have taken my chances. Others did, I mean other teachers in the highschool.\"\"How many?\"\"Let me see. We had thirty-five teachers. Only four, well, five, were fullyconvinced Nazis. But, of these five, one could be argued with openly, in theteachers' conference room; and only one was a real fanatic, who might denounce acolleague to the authorities.\"\"Did he?\"\"There was never any evidence that he did, but we had to be careful around him.\"\"How many of the thirty-five never joined the Party?\"\"Five, but not all for the same reason. Three of the five were very religious.The teachers were all Protestants, of course, but only half a dozen, at most,were really religious; these were all anti-Nazi, these half-dozen, but onlythree of them held out. One of the three was the history teacher(now the director of the school), very nationalistic, very Prussian, but astrong churchman. He stood near the anti-Nazi Confessional Church, but hecouldn't join it, of course, or he'd have lost his job. Then there was thetheology teacher, who also taught modern languages; he was the best teacher inthe school; apart from his religious opposition, his knowledge of foreigncultures made him anti-Nazi. The third was the mathematics teacher, absolutelyunworldly but profoundly pietistic, a member of the Moravian sect.\"\"And the two who were nonreligious and didn't join?\"\"One was a historian. He was not an atheist, you understand, just a historian.He was a nonjoiner, of anything. He was nonpolitical. He was strongly criticalof Nazism, but always on a detached, theoretical basis. Nobody bothered him;nobody paid any attention to him. And vice versa. The other nonbeliever wasreally the truest believer of them all. He was a biologist and a rebel against areligious background. He had no trouble perverting Darwin's 'survival of thefittest' into Nazi racism—he was the only teacher in the whole school whobelieved it.\"\"Why didn't he join the Party?\"\"He hated the local Kreisleiter, the County Leader of the Party, whose fatherhad been a theologian and who himself never left the Church. The hatred wasmutual. That's why the biologist never joined. Now he's an 'anti-Nazi.' \"\"And you?\"\"Yes,\" he said, blushing a little again. \"I joined. I had my past, of course, inEast Prussia. All sorts of care had been taken to bury it, but—one never knew. Ihad been active in the old Staatspartei, the successor of the Democratic Partyin 1930. After 1930 I had lectured regularly at the local folk high school, theadult education program, which was promoted and largely attended by SocialDemocrats and Com-The Furies: Heinrich Hildebrandtmunists. In my book program, on the radio, I had praised the works of'treasonable' writers after the Nazis took power.\"For eight years I held the rank of Studienassessor. It carries no tenure withit. After 1933 my name was not even included in the list of candidates forStudienrat, the rank which is usually given after five years of high-schoolteaching. The spring the Nazis took power, I was dismissed from my radio programand from my adult-school lectureship. Then I was transferred from the city toone small school after another. So I resigned, very quietly, and came here, toHesse. My father, through an old Army friend of his here, got me the appointmentin Kronenberg. But still I was not promoted, and I was afraid that something wassuspected. I waited two years, and then I joined the Party. I was promoted toStudienrat and got married/ 7\"And Frau Hildebrandt?\" I said. I watched for the blush, but there was none; it(whatever it was) wasn't Frau Hildebrandt.\"Eva went just the other way from me. In 1933 she was for Hitler. Of course, shewas much younger than I and her family was petty nobility, who were all in theold Nationalist Party, which threw its weight, at the end, to the Nazis. But sheadored the Jewish Professor Neumann at Kiel—who didn't?—and the day of thebook-burning there he instructed the secretary of his philosophy seminar to givehis books to the students. Eva got three of Neumann's own books, her proudestpossession—and still she believed in Nazism. She was what we call begeistert,bewitched.\"We first met in 1938, at the Casino, in Kassel, for officers and theirfamilies. The young men—we weren't so young any more—all went there with theirparents. I was with my parents, she with hers; our fathers were both retiredofficers and old acquaintances. It happened to be onJanuary 30, the anniversary of Hitler's coming to power, but that was only anaccident; the Casino society was by no means Nazi. We danced, which I was notvery good at\"— he blushed, just a little—\"but a month later I gave a talk thereand she came, and 'fell for me/\"I was already a Party member. She was really nonpolit-ical, at heart It'sfunny; I, with my knowledge of politics, I became more and more Nazi, and shebecame less and less. After the synagogue burning, at the end of '38, she wasstrongly anti-Nazi. She got out Neumann's books and cried. I told her she didn'tunderstand these things. She didn't, either, but she knew them, sensed them,better than I did— or than I was willing to. From then on, until I went into theArmy in '39, we quarreled all the time. But now it's all right.\" (It was, too. Ihad met the Hildebrandt family frequently.)\"She never quit the Party, of course. She had joined in '37, too, not untilthen; she was a teacher, and she did it to hold her job. But women are braverthan men, don't you think?\"\"Yes,\" I said (still wondering what it was, besides \"fear and advantage,\" thathad made a Nazi of Herr Hildebrandt) .\"It's because—well, they don't face things the same way men do. They assume thatthe man will find a way to support the family. They could be stronger Nazis orstronger anti-Nazis than men, without thinking too much about it. Most of them.\"I thought I saw a faint blush, at this last, but it was late afternoon in thewinter. I turned the lights on.Hildebrandt had no guilt about his \"Nazi\" teaching of literature. \"One couldtalk about other things, outside the textbooks, and there was 'un-German'literature that hadThe Furies: Heinrich Hildebrandtbeen overlooked, such as Lessing's Nathan the Wise, which we read openly inclass. The BuddenbrooJb, too; it was not specifically forbidden, but everybodyknew that the Nazis hated Thomas Mann.\"Privately, certain students read Jewish authors—it went without saying thatthey were not to be read—like Wasser-mann, Werfel, Zweig, and wrote papers onthem, brought them to me, and I accepted them for credit, although they were notdiscussed in class. And I gave them French and English literature, more so thanbefore, although to do so was one of those vague betrayals of the 'new spirit';still, it had not been specifically forbidden. Of course, I always said, toprotect myself (but I said it in such a way that I hoped the students would seethrough it), that the foreign works we read were only a reflection of Germanliterature. So, you see, Herr Professor, a man could show some—someindependence, even, so to say, secretly/'\"I understand/' I said.\"Many of the students—the best of them—understood what was going on in all this.It was a sort of dumb-show game that we were all playing, I with them. The worsteffect, I think, was that it made them cynical, the best ones. But, then, itmade the teachers cynical, too. I think the classroom in those years was one ofthe causes of the cynicism you see in the best young men and women in Germanytoday.\"\"In the best?\"\"Yes. The others, the great majority, are disillusioned now, but that issomething else. You see, the young people, and, yes, the old, too, were drawn toopposite extremes in those years. People outside Germany seem to think that 'theGermans' came to believe everything they were told, all the dreadful nonsensethat passed for truth. It is a verybad mistake, a very dangerous mistake, to think this. The fact, I think, is thatmost Germans came to believe everything, absolutely everything; but the rest,those who saw through the nonsense, came to believe nothing, absolutely nothing.These last, the best, are the cynics now, young and old/'\"And the others, the believers?\"\"Well, the old among them are, I suppose you would say, the hopeless now. Theyounger, those who were teen-agers then—I don't know what to say about themexcept that they have lost their old illusions and see nothing new to turn to.This is dangerous, both for them and for the world ten or twenty years from now.They need, well, to be born again, somehow.\"I asked Herr Hildebrandt if he could recollect specific instances of his own\"dumb-show game,\" and the next time we met he spoke of them. \"In Shakespeare,for instance, only Macbeth and, of course, The Merchant of Venice, which I neverassigned, were recommended. But, again, nothing was forbidden, although Hamletwas denounced as embodying the 'flabbiness of soul' that the Nazis condemned inRussian writers like Dostoevski and Tolstoi, the 'soft Slavic soul' that inTolstoi even went so far as pacifism. So in Shakespeare I could assign AMidsummer Night's Dream, which in normal times I should not have bothered with,just so that I could say to the students, 'The music for this was written byMendelssohn. Your parents all know the music. Mendelssohn was a Jew. We don'tplay his music any more/ Perhaps that was not much to say, but it was something,don't you think?\"\"Yes,\" I said, \"certainly Tell me, Herr Hildebrandt,what about Julius Caesar?\"He smiled very, very wryly. \"Julius Caesar? No . . . no.\"The Furies: Heinrich Hildebrandt\"Was it forbidden?\"\"Not that I remember. But that is not the way it was. Everything was notregulated specifically, ever. It was not like that at all. Choices were left tothe teacher's discretion, within the 'German spirit/ That was all that wasnecessary; the teacher had only to be discreet. If he himself wondered at allwhether anyone would object to a given book, he would be wise not to use it.This was a much more powerful form of intimidation, you see, than any fixed listof acceptable or unacceptable writings. The way it was done was, from the pointof view of the regime, remarkably clever and effective. The teacher had to makethe choices and risk the consequences; this made him all the more cautious.\"\"You spoke of giving certain students books by Jewish authors,\" I said, onanother occasion. \"How did you know which students you could trust not todenounce you?\"\"Oh, one judges, from person to person. I may say generally that one would besafe in giving such books to MiscJiIinge [mongrels, half-Jews] and those fromknown liberal families. People who were so far under suspicion would neverdenounce one, because they would not be believed— people, that is, who wereclearly beyond currying favor with the authorities. It was like complaining toJews about the regime; it was safe.\"\"I can imagine,\" I said, \"that some Jews would have resented being a sort ofsecret wailing wall for people who had something on their minds that they didnot dare to say openly.\" I knew he would blush a little, and he did. \"Yes. Ithink most Jews resented it, very deeply. That was why some people didn't doit.\"\"Yes,\" I said.\"In those times,\" he went on, \"a student could have de-nounced me, but it would have been hard to make a case against me, because Iwas, well, clever in the way I did these things. But, even if I had beendenounced, I could have got off, almost certainly, if my past were not revealed,because I was a Party member. You may say that it is a rationalization —I knowit is, myself—but a Party member could get away with something, not much, butsomething. A non-Nazi would not dare to violate the rules. At least none in ourschool did/'\"Were there any spies in the classes?\" I said.\"No, unless students volunteered to be informers. The regime regarded informersas patriots, of course, but you know how students would feel; young peopledespise that kind of thing. There certainly were no spies, or even regularinformers, that I heard of in our school. Not before the war, anyway. Andcertainly not during the war (although I was away in the Army except for myfurlough in '40, after the fall of France). During the war even anti-Naziteachers would not criticize the regime. Once the war began, all this ended. Wewere 'one folk/ We could not separate the regime from our country then/'\"The July 20 conspirators did/'\"Yes.. . yes, they did. They did.\"I knew he was blushing, as he did so easily, but I did not look up. I waswaiting—perhaps I only imagine it now, long afterward—for something that wouldbring his blush to a boil. I had a long time to wait.He showed me the government manual for upper-school teaching, issued in 1938.Under Literatur there was this: \"Of course, only such selections should bechosen as point in the direction of the New Germany, help prepare the new worldoutlook [Weltanschauung], or give instances of its innermost will. As werecognize only the vigorous asThe Furies: Heinrich Hildebrandteducationally valuable, everything must be avoided that weakens or discouragesmanliness. The thought of race will stand out strongest with a vivid knowledgeof Teutonism.\" And then, apparently as subjects for study: \"The nation as acommunity of fate and struggle. The struggle for living space. Soldiery (Army,Navy, Air Corps). Heroism. War poetry. The soldier of the World War as alegendary figure and a moral force. Woman in the World War. The community ofNational Socialist struggle. Leadership, comradeship. The fight of the Germannation on our frontiers and abroad. Colonies.\"\"That was all/ 7 said Herr Hildebrandt, \"although, of course, all these thingswould be explicated, but still not in detail, in the publications or meetings ofthe Lehrerbund, the Nazi teacher organization. But it was all very sloppy andvague. Under those headings one could teach almost anything—except, maybe, AllQuiet on the Western Front/\"\"Why was it so sloppy?\" I said.\"Partly because the Nazification of the secondary schools was known to bedifficult. They were stronger and better organized professionally than theprimary schools. There the teachers were much more insecure, and also moresusceptible, because, having to teach everything, they had been trainedthoroughly in nothing. This half-educated condition made them excellent Nazimaterial; they could be 'taught' anything fast. We had a joke in those days:'What is speed?'—'Speed is an instant so short that a grade-school teacherhasn't time to change his politics.'\"Then, too, the primary schools were more important to the regime. There theycould reach all the children of the country, while we, in the high schools, hadonly one-fourth of them. So the primary schools had to be brought into linefirst, the secondary schools later. They never finished thejob, but in another ten years, maybe even five, they would have.\"\"So soon?\"\"So soon. One may say overnight Resistance is low in a dictatorship. And thiswas, or would have become, an efficient dictatorship, even in cultural matters.There it was weakest, at the beginning, because the oldest and most trustedNazis were uncultivated men, except for a few freaks like Rosenberg. Andwherever there was a 'deserving' Party member and no other place could be foundfor him, he would be dumped into education. The Nazi 'educators' wereilliterate, from Rust, the Minister of Education, on down. They did not knowwhat they wanted or where to find it. Putting ignorant 'reliables/ from politicsor business, over the educators was also part of the Nazi way of humiliatingeducation and bringing it into popular contempt.\"Then, too, the Party education bosses did not know themselves when the Partyline would change, and they were afraid of being caught on the wrong side whenit did. Any author might suddenly prove to be 'decadent/ although, incidentally,when one hears so much of Goethe now as an anti-Nazi symbol, one recalls thatall (almost all, certainly) of Goethe was recommended. His universalism was notso powerful or direct as to embarrass National Socialism. I do not mean to makelight of the greatest genius of all, but if he had lived a century longer hemight have wished to rewrite every word so that he could not be used by theNazis/'\"It might have ruined his poetry, Herr Studienrat.\"He smiled at my form of address, and emphasized his: \"Yes,. Herr Professor, butnow we sound like the classroom. I was speaking, oh, yes, of the sudden changesin the Party line. There were not so many, except the great ones, whichThe Furies: Heinrich Hildebrandtyou know of, like the Russian pact of '39, and these did not immediately affectus. The difficulty was that changes could not be predicted. Living writers,unless they were Party hacks, could not be recommended at all, because theymight turn anti-Nazi or be found to have been anti-Nazi or Communistic.\"It was not what a man wrote, but what his politics were (or were accused ofbeing) that counted with the Nazis. Hans Grimm, for instance, was a great Partyfavorite because of his story, VoIJc ohne Raum, 'A People without Living Space';then he became critical of the Nazis and had to be anathematized and his booksforbidden—no matter what they contained. By the way, even Wilhelm Tell wassuddenly forbidden during the war, at the time when it was thought thatSwitzerland might be attacked.\"In history, in biology, and in economics the teaching program was much moreelaborate than it was in literature, and much stricter. These subjects werereally rewritten. They had to be. But literature could not so easily berewritten to order. The rewritten subjects were the worst nonsense, and, ofcourse, the cynicism of the teachers and the better students was worst there.Every student had to take a biology examination to be graduated, and the biologycourse was a complete distortion of Mendelianism to prove that heredity waseverything; such technical materials were most effective, of course, because thestudent had never met them before.\"But mathematics was the most interesting case. You would think that nothingcould be done with such a 'pure' subject, but just this subject was handled verycleverly, and I often wondered who in the Party was so clever. I remember well,because Eva, my wife, taught mathematics. The problems to be assigned were allgiven, but they wouldalmost all be taken from such subjects as ballistics or military deployment, orfrom architecture, with Nazi memorials or monuments as examples, or frominterest rates—'A Jew lent RM 500 @ 12% interest . . . '—or from populationratios. The students would be given the problem of projecting population curvesof the Teutonic/ 'Roman/ and 'Slavic' peoples of Europe, with the question:'What would be their relative sizes in 1960? What danger do you recognize forthe Teutonic peoples in this? 7\"Everything depended, actually, on the director of the school, everything, thatis, outside the textbooks. The director of ours was a Nazi, of course, but not areal one, not a Fanatilcer. He would tell the district superintendent, when hecame for an inspection, that everything was all right, and the superintendentwas too busy, and too unsure of himself academically, to look closer. Andeverything was all right, if what is meant is the absence of talk or teachingagainst the government. That's the same in America, I think—everywhere/'Herr Hildebrandt's hardest experience was, I felt, somewhere outside his schoolwork. He told me, fairly freely, how hard it was to sit with fellow-members ofthe Party in a cafe and hear them vituperate Jews in ignorant passion. \"I wouldsit there,\" he said, \"and say nothing. This was not heroic, and yet it wassomething, a little something. A wild Fanatiker like your friend Schwenke,seeing that I never said anything in agreement, might have taken it into hishead to denounce me, and my past, which would have been fatal, might have comeout.\"Once, in 1938 in a cafe in Baden-Baden, he saw a family of Jews from Kronenberg.\"I was wearing my Party insignia and sitting with some Party men. Understand, Iwas proud to be wearing the insignia. It showed I *be-The Furies: Heinrich Hildebrandtlonged/ and the pleasure of 'belonging/ so soon after feeling excluded,isolated, is very great. Maybe in America you don't have these feelings; in thatcase you are very lucky, but also, in that case, you may have difficulty inunderstanding what it was like for men like me here.\"Still—I didn't want those Jews from our town to see me wearing my insignia. Inever wore it at home, except for special events, where there were no Jews. Theuniform and insignia were a sort of anti-Semitism in themselves, and I was notan—an anti-Semite. It hurt me to have Jews see me wearing them. So, when I sawthese Jews in the cafe, I tried to sit so that they wouldn't see me. When Ithink of that now, I still blush/'\"Did they see you?\"\"I don't think so,\" he said, blushing.Prompted by the blush this time, I thought that I might hit upon HerrHildebrandt's secret, if he had one. But the tack I took turned out to be empty.\"When were you really disillusioned with National Socialism?\" I said in a laterconversation.The blush again; deeper, this time. \"Only after the war -really.\"\"That discourages me,\" I said, \"because you are so much more sensitive than mostpeople, and this makes me realize how hard it must be, under such conditions,for people, even sensitive people, to see what is going on around them.\" Hecontinued to blush, but my blush-detector told me that this was not it.\"It's all so well masqueraded,\" he said, \"the bad always mixed up with the goodand the harmless, and you tell yourself that you are making up for the bad bydoing a few little things like speaking of Mendelssohn in class.\"\"And so you were,\" I said.\"No. No,\" he said, shaking his head, \"but that is very kind of you to say. No, Iwould not be honest with you if I told you that I was always an anti-Nazi, thatI always thought and felt like an anti-Nazi. It is so easy these days to say'anti-Nazi' and even to believe it. Before 1933 I certainly was, but then—onlyagain after the war.\"I fooled myself. I had to. Everybody has to. If the good had been twice as goodand the bad only half as bad, I still ought to have seen it, all through as Idid in the beginning, because I am, as you say, sensitive. But I didn't want tosee it, because I would then have had to think about the consequences of seeingit, what followed from seeing it, what I must do to be decent. I wanted my homeand family, my job, my career, a place in the community. I wanted to be able tosleep nights—\"\"Weren't you?\" I said.\"Not in the period when I was deciding whether to join; but after the decisionit was better, always better. I enjoyed doing those little things at school,'defying' the Party, not because what I did was right (that, too, of course) butbecause I showed I was clever and, above all, because I 'belonged.' I belongedto the new 'nobility/ and the nobility can get away with certain things justbecause they are the nobility; merely getting away with them proves that theyare the nobility, even to themselves. So I slept.\"It was near the end of our many, many conversations that I said, \"Those Jews yousaw in the cafe, in Baden-Baden that time, when you tried not to have them seeyou; who were they, Herr Hildebrandt, do you remember?\"The needle on my blush-detector jumped. \"Yes. Yes, of course, I remember. Theywere friends of the Wolff family, my—my relatives.\"The Furies: Heinrich Hildebrandt\"Wolff?\"\"Yes.\"\"Here in Kronenberg?\"\"Yes. At the University/'\"Professor Wolff? Eberhard Wolff?\"\"Yes.\"\"But he was a Jew.\"\"Yes.\"\"How were they related to you, Herr Hildebrandt?\"\"Oh, not by blood. Professor Wolff was Jewish, his wife three-quarters Jewish.Their son Erich married my cousin Sibylle.\"\"Sibylle,\" I said. \"That's a very pretty-\"My two small boys broke into the room, to get their afternoon cake. Being smallAmerican boys, they did not say, \"Guten Tag, Herr Studienrat,\" they said, Tag';but, being small boys in Germany, they did have the decency to shake hands allaround before grabbing for the cake.A few visits later I reverted to the Wolff family, and again the needle jumped.The Wolffs were closely related to the most illustrious Jewish name in Germany,and intermarriage between Jews and non-Jews in this great family had beencommon. The Wolff home in Kronen-berg was a great, ancient pile on theSchlossweg, the beautiful wooded area of old mansions on the hill, beyond theCastle. I knew that the aged Frau Professor Wolff (Frau Geheimrat Wolff, hereminent husband having borne the additional eminence of \"Geheimrat,\" ordistinguished professor) still lived, alone with a servant, in the family home.What I learned, without much difficulty (indeed, he spoke with understandablepride, although the blush remained), was that Herr Hildebrandt had saved theWolffs' home during the Third Reich by arranging for the trans-fer of its ownership to another \"Aryan\" in-law in a pretended sale. Hildebrandthad been a frequent visitor at the Wolffs' before he joined the Party; then hisvisits dropped off and, finally, when the ownership of the home was transferred,although the family still lived there, stopped altogether. Why?\"I felt uncomfortable/' said the teacher. \"You may well believe that. I wantedto talk about the current situation and to try to explain my position, butProfessor Wolff, who was quite old, would never let me talk about such things.He would not tolerate talk about National Socialism, against it or for it.\"I had always felt very much at home there. Everyone did who came. It was likethe old times of books, music, poetry, art; another age. And it never changed.But after I joined the Party I felt out of place. When other people werethere—it was a great house, with many friends—I knew that I was always the onlyNazi. The others were not open anti-Nazis, of course, but the fact that theywere there spoke for itself. And the talk always avoided politics. It dideverywhere, in those days. It was—well, at the worst, it was simply that, if youhad not been present when somebody said something against the regime, there wasno danger of anything's being forced out of you later on. So nobody talkedpolitics, not among non-Nazis.\"When I was there alone, after I joined the Party, it was still worse. I playedchess with the Professor, or we listened to music, and he never spoke, exceptpolitely. And I knew I couldn't speak, to say (at least to try to say) how Ifelt. So the visits became formal, and then stopped.\"\"But you saved his home/'\"Yes.\"\"Didn't that make you feel better?\"The Furies: Heinrich Hildebrandt\"No.\"\"Why not?\"\"Because with him I wanted to say how I felt, and he wouldn't let me.\"On one of our last visits—Herr Hildebrandt was at my house—he said, \"Herr Mayer\"(he had, with my help, got over calling me \"Herr Professor\"), \"there issomething else I should like to tell you about.\"\"Please,\" I said. The blush was coming up again.\"It was at the end of 1940, when I came back on leave. My wife was almost eightmonths pregnant, and we were living in two furnished rooms. Housing was veryshort. We heard an apartment was available, but only on the way there did welearn that it was the apartment of the lawyer, Dr, Stern. Have you heard ofhim?\"\"Yes,\" I said. \"Herr Damm, the Kreisamtsleiter, told me he once saved theSterns' apartment for them, when an SA leader tried to get it. And PolicemanHofmeister mentioned them, too.\"The blush mounted sharply. \"Did Hofmeister tell you about the—the deportation ofthe Sterns?\"\"No, except to say that they were deported and how bad he felt about it.\" Theblush subsided a little, I thought.\"Well,\" said Hildebrandt, \"it was a lovely apartment. We spoke in a veryfriendly way with the Sterns (his wife and daughter were there) and they withus. We said that we had not come as Nazis, and we explained our situation. Theybelieved us, obviously, and Dr. Stern said he wanted to move anyway to be nearertheir friends and relatives. (Most of the Jews in Kronenberg had moved into theold Bertholdstrasse; I forget what new name the Nazis gave it, but it was not aformal, compulsory ghetto.)\"We assumed that, now that Dr. Stern could have onlyJews for clients, and the Jews were becoming so poor, he could no longer affordthe apartment I felt bad, very bad, and Eva felt worse; she was already sostrongly anti-Nazi, and here she felt that her condition was responsible fordriving these people from their home, for our wanting an apartment so badly. Itwas very embarrassing. 'Still/ I said to myself, 'if we don't take it, someoneelse will/ and just then Dr. Stern said: 'If you don't take it, Herr Studienrat,someone else will/ So we—we took it/'The blush remained level.It was getting on for evening again, and the room was growing dark. I wasfumbling around, in my memory, and in my imagination. There was somethingconnected with Jews, with the Wolffs, possibly with the Stems, that HerrHildebrandt wanted (or didn't want) to tell me.\"The Wolffs,\" I said, groping. \"How was it you said you were related to them?\"\"Erich Wolff, Eberhard's son/' said the teacher. \"He was a lawyer. But he'dwanted to be a musician. He played the piano, and I played the violin, and in myfirst two years in Kronenberg, before I joined the Party, we played duetstogether sometimes. He was married to—my cousin/'\"Of course/' I said, \"Sibylle, the beautiful name.\"I didn't need the light; I could feel the heat.\"What became of Erich?\" I asked.\"He went to Italy, in '39, and died there. Of a heart attack. Or suicide. Wedon't know which.\"\"And his wife, Sibylle?\"This was it.\"She stayed here.\"\"Did you see her, after you stopped seeing the Wolffs?\"\"Yes.\"\"How did she feel about your being in the Party?\"The Furies; Heinrich Hildebiandt\"She—she advised me to join. Not exactly advised, but accepted my reasons. Shesaw the necessity. She agreed with me that I might be able to help the Wolffsthat way. I was to keep them advised—through her—of all developments and of anydangers and do what I could. She thought that might be helpful And it was, up toa point/'\"Up to a point?\"\"Yes.\"\"She went on seeing her father- and mother-in-law, of course?\"\"Oh, yes. We would be talking and she would say, 'You must excuse me now, I amgoing up to the Schlossweg, to the Wolffs', to gauJceln.' Gaulcelrz means'juggle/ but it also means 'talk without saying anything/ 'beat around thebush.' It meant she was going to the Wolffs' and pretend, as one always didthere now, that everything was the same as always.\"\"Do you know if she talked to the Wolffs about you?\"\"She-tried.\"\"But you yourself never saw them again, after you joined the Party or after youarranged the 'sale' of their house?\"\"No. Well—once. It was they that I saw in the caf6, in Baden-Baden that time,when I told you that it was friends of theirs that I saw. It was they I did notwant to see me.\"\"When was that?\"\"In '39, just before the war. I knew they were there, because my wife andSibylle and I had driven down together, and, after we'd got rooms and gone outagain in Sibylle's car, she stopped in front of another hotel and said to me,'You'd better get out now.' It meant that the Wolffs were there, and she didn'twant them to have to meet me,\"\"Or, maybe, you to have to meet them.\"\"Yes.\"\"Do you think that Sibylle would rather you hadn't joined the Party, even tohelp protect the family?\"\"I think so 7 yes Yes.\"\"Do you think she was right, Herr Hildebrandt?\"\"I—. I don't know, Herr Professor.\" (I noticed the lapse back to \"HerrProfessor.\")\"I'd like to meet her,\" I said.\"She's dead,\" said Herr HildebrandtIt was dark in the room now, but I still tried to take notes, just a few words(the way a reporter does) to remind me, so that I could fill them out afterward.In the dark my writing ran all over the paper.\"Dead?\"\"Yes. She worked in the 'underground/ Herr Mayer, to help people escape fromGermany. That's why she stayed. Her husband was more than half Jewish; hecouldn't help her. In '42, before the Sterns were deported, sent to theconcentration camp at Theresienstadt and then to the 'East,' she was trying toarrange their escape into Italy. She must have been somewhere on theSwiss-Italian border. The Gestapo got her.\"\"And-?\"\"Her family was told that she had been arrested and hanged herself in the jailat Constance.\"\"Had she?\"\"No.\" This came like a shot. \"No. She would not have hanged herself.Unless—unless things had reached the point where she knew she might talk withoutknowing it and endanger others.\"I could not see Herr Hildebrandt now.\"Did she—did they—have any children?\"\"A son.\"The Furies: Heinrich Hildebrandt\"What happened to him?\"\"I—.\" He stopped, and then resumed. \"I—arranged it so that I was appointed hisguardian. He's in the university now.\"My wife rapped at the door to say it was time for dinner and to ask HerrHildebrandt if he'd stay. He said \"No/' and I went to the front door with himwithout turning on the lights.CHAPTER 167'he Furies; Johann Kessler\"I still say/' said Herr Kessler, \"that National Socialism was good forGermany.\"\"Was it good for you?\" I said, on an off chance.There was a pause. Then: \"No.\"\"Why not?\" I said, \"if it was good for Germany?\"\"Perhaps we will talk about that, one day, Herr Professor.\"We did, one day, months later. It burst out. \"Through National Socialism I lostmy soul. I blasphemed. Every night, through all those years, I blasphemed; Isaid my children's prayers with them; I took the name of the Lord in vain. Iwanted them to be Christians, and I myself had denied Jesus Christ.\"Johann Kessler had been born and brought up a Catholic, in a Catholic village inWiirttemberg, in southern Germany. He was the second son in a large family; hisolder brother would inherit the Kesslerhof. He himself wanted to learn. At ninehe had gone to the village priest and asked to be taught Latin. At ten he wantedto be a monk, and he was so insistent that his mother (his father was dead now)sent him with the priest to a Benedictine monastery nearby. The monks were kindto him, but there were no other children and he had to get up at midnight anddawn for Mass; at the end of a week he wanted toThe Furies: Johann Kesslergo home. The monks told him that he might come back, if he wanted to, ateighteen.At eighteen he was a soldier. At seventeen he had been a bank clerk, leading aglorious life in town. The day the first World War began he enlisted and servedas an Army regular through the war. He participated in the suppression of theCommunist rebellion in Munich after the Armistice. Then he was demobilized, gota job again as a bank clerk after a year unemployed, wound up in Frankfurt,jobless again, in the depression of 1931, and moved to a village just outsideKronenberg, where he worked for a year as manager of an estate and wasunemployed again.He was very happily married to a fine, large woman, a good \"free-thinking 77Protestant. She had never been converted to Catholicism, but he had gone onbeing a Catholic, less ardently than he had been as a child, of course, and theKessJers' two children, a boy and a girl, were being brought up in the Catholicfaith. Like a good woman, Frau Kessler respected her husband and his wishes;like a good man, he was warmly devoted to his children, much more so than any ofmy North German friends.Herr Kessler was an engaging personality, a semilearned man among unlearned men,and a popular public speaker, in the rolling, sententious Fourth-of-July vein, afavorite at weddings and birthdays, at veterans' meetings, and at assemblies ofthe nationalist Kyffhauserbund. Politically he was a good Catholic centrist ofthe conservative, clerical-agricultural wing of the Center rather than itsChristian Socialist-trade-union wing. But he had no compunction, in 1933,against joining the National Socialist Party m the hope of getting a job. He wasplaced in personnel work-where he belonged—in the Kronenberg Labor Front officeand was appointed one of several 'Tarty Orators\" for thecounty, one of the little men with big voices who addressed small-town meetings.He was allowed to speak on the Party's history and on German history and culturebut never received (or asked for) the special permission required to speak forthe Party on \"the Jewish question.\" Every Sunday morning at ten the Party had atwo-hour service at the local theater. It was not exactly a religious service,although the speakers, and especially Party Orator Kessler, often took religiousor, more properly, spiritual themes.Those who came to the Sunday-morning services, like those who spoke at them,knew that they should have been in church; at least the hours conflicted. Afterthe Church-Party split began to develop, in 1936, the Party services became moreritualistic, more specifically a substitute for church. When, a year or twolater, Church-Party relations had become bitter, it was not uncommon at theclose of the Party service for the SA and the Hitler Jugend to march noisily(even singing) past the churches, whose services, beginning at eleven, were inprogress. Kessler became the most popular speaker in the vicinity at theSunday-morning meetings of the Party.One day in 1938 Kessler was asked to perform a German Faith Movement funeralservice, for a Nazi who had died in the new racist-naturalist Nordicism ofAlfred Rosenberg, the official Nazi philosopher. No pastor in Kronenberg, noteven Weber, who was a Nazi, would conduct such a service; Rosenberg's FaithMovement was the purest paganism, with the orb of the sun as the center of itssymbolism. It was radical even for Nazism.The man who had once been the boy who wanted to be a monk, whose dying motherhad placed her missal in his hands and said, \"Whatever happens to you, neverThe Furies: Johann .Kesslerstop praying/' had a hard time deciding. The County Leader of the Party, whohimself had not left the Protestant Church, did not order or ask him to performthe service. It was the Party red-hots who put pressure on him, men above whom,in natural gifts and feeling, Kessler stood high. But it was a chance for theman who had once wanted to be a monk to be a cleric, of some sort, and, besides,\"There was no one else to conduct the service. That part of my impulse wasChristian. But the service—the service was not.\"That evening, when Kessler came home, he told his wife that he had left theCatholic Church and asked her to say the children's prayers with them. Shelooked at him and said nothing. She finished the dishes and then started to thechildren's room, when the two children's voices were heard in a jingle theyalways sang when they were ready for their father to come in for prayers: \"Thechildren will not go to sleep, 'til Daddy's asked God their souls to keep.\"Kessler pushed past his wife, went in himself, and said the prayers, ending withthe usual words, \"In Christus Namen, In Jesus' name/'That night, having said nothing more to his wife, he went to the parish priestand told him he was no longer a Christian. \"I was going to tell him about thefuneral, but he knelt and prayed—\"\"Did you?\"\"Kneel?\"\"Yes.\"\"No.\"\"Did you pray?\"\"No. No, I didn't I waited until he stood up, and then I left.\"\"Were you going to tell him about the children's prayers?\"\"Was I?\"\"Yes.\"\"No.\"\"I went home/ 7 Herr Kessler continued. \"I told my wife, and talked to heralmost all that night It wasn't so serious for her, because she was notchurch-connected. And she wasn't interested in politics or in history. I hadread Rosenberg's Myth of the Twentieth Century, the 'bible' of the FaithMovement. It was on the Papal Index, and 7 although I could have got permissionfrom my priest to read it, I hadn't bothered to or hadn't wanted to. Inside Ihad been turning against the Church ever since I'd become a Nazi, against thepolitical Church, the Papacy as a government. Canossa, the struggle of theGerman kings against the popes, the right of Germany and Germans to be free froman outside government—this was the way I had been thinking. It is the way Istill think, too.\"All this I told my wife. She didn't say much, almost nothing. Only at the endshe said, 'And the children?' And then she added, from the Bible, 'The father'sblessing builds the children's house/\"What would happen to my children, my children?\" he went on, one momentimpassioned, the next didactic. \"They could not go to church any more or toSunday school. And the teaching in the public schools is not adequate for themoral development of children. Many times afterward I talked with teachers aboutit I never got a satisfactory answer. Blut und Boden, blood and soil, theeternal life of the plants, of the animals, of nature—that's only a part of thereligious story; it isn't religion.\"I told my wife: 'When they're twelve or thirteen, theyThe Furies; Johann Kesslershall decide for themselves/ I knew when I said it that that was a lie, the samelie, at bottom, that dominated the Hitler Youth, the lie that children caneducate themselves. Children who grow up without religion cannot decide aboutreligion for themselves; that's a fallacy, that people can choose intelligentlybetween what they know and what they don't know. What it was, was an excuse forme, a shimmer of hope to excuse me, hope that they would find what I had lost,that they, my little children, would absolve me!\"At the end, when I had finished talking that night, I was more tired than Ihave ever been before or since. I told myself—not my wife—that I could remain aChristian in soul. It wasn't true. It wasn't true. The next day I declared myintention to leave the Church before the county court. It was done. After that,I never had a quiet hour—\"\"Until after the war?\"\"What has the war to do with it?\"\"I mean, until now, when things are changed again.\"\"Do you mean that because the Nazis are gone, and the outside has changed, thatthe inside has changed? There are things that don't change so easily, HerrProfessor. When I say, 'After that I never had a quiet hour/ I mean every hourafter that, this hour included/'During the next six years Herr Kessler was called upon more and more often toperform German Faith Movement funerals, baptisms, even weddings. There was nochurch service, of course, for the funerals, only a cemetery service, and nosermon but, rather, a speech, \"no Bible, never a word about God or the soul, thewhole personal afterlife denied by the clearest implication/' The baptismcelebrated nature as the source of life and the child's father as the\"life-giver/' and the wedding joined the couple as \"Germans.\"\"But,\" said Herr Kessler, \"man is still man, he must be comforted in thepresence of death and sobered in the presence of life. Those who had left theChurch—Evangelical or Catholic—had no place to go. And no—pastor/'\"But the municipal marriage office performed weddings, didn't they?\"\"Yes, but Germans are religious, including those who believe they are not.Especially as regards death. During the war, it was hard in the hospitals. If awounded soldier died confessed in the Church, or even if he died unconscious andhis religion was unknown, the Church would bury him. But when they died havingsaid they had left the Church, and their identity was unknown or their relativescouldn't be found, the hospital called the Party office, and they asked me toofficiate.\"\"Even if they were not known to be members of the Faith Movement?\"\"Even then. Even if they were not known to be members of the Party. Very few,that we knew of, were members of the Faith Movement. But, if men died who hadleft the Church, what was there to be done? We were glad to do it. I was gladmyself, although I knew it was blasphemy; so far had I fallen that I was glad tobe of 'service/\"Millions had left the Church—the Protestant much more than the Catholic—before1933. Not just Social Democrats and, of course, Communists, but people ingeneral. That had been going on since 1918, more and more all the time.Protestants, especially, didn't believe in the Church any more, because theProtestant Church was the official Church, the State Church, and its headThe Furies: Johann Kesslerwas the King of Prussia, who happened to be the Kaiser, the Emperor of Germany.With the Kaiser gone, the Church didn't know where it stood; it was as if Godhad run away to the Netherlands. Only when the Nazi flag flew over it again didit know (or think it knew) where it stood.\"The Catholic Church was different; the head and center of the Catholic Churchwere outside Germany. The German Catholic—and, if you include Austria, Germanyis half Catholic—had an allegiance which, while it was not temporal, had atemporal capital, Rome. This 'divided allegiance' the Nazis hated, and I hatedit with them. But it was just this 'foreign loyalty' that provided a greaterpossibility of Catholic resistance to Nazism.\"\"Which, however,\" I said, \"did not materialize.\"\"That's so,\" said Herr Kessler, \"not in the masses or the priests, but foranother reason. But, for one Protestant prelate who resisted, you found two orthree or four Catholic prelates.\"Outside Catholicism only women, and especially old women, were very religiousany more, except in the villages; and to some extent this was true even there.The Protestant cathedal churches stood almost empty, sometimes with moretourists than communicants. The women tried to make their husbands go toservices with them for the children's sake, but they were not always successful.The sermons had always been dull, and now they had lost any great meaning, anycomfort, any relevance to people's lives.\"The trouble was that the Church—Catholic as well as Protestant—was supported bytaxes. Thus it did not have to consider the people's wants in order itself tosurvive, or minister to their needs. When their wants and needs changed, theChurch, especially the Protestant Church,didn't know it. Only in the villages (those that could still support a residentpastor) were the people and the Church in real contact Otherwise, only a fewyoung and enthusiastic pastors ever called on their parishioners, except ingreat sickness. If you were ever to see your pastor, you had to call on him inhis visiting hours, which were during workingmen's working hours, and then youhad to sit and wait for him, as you would at the dentist's, and he would look athis watch while you talked; or perhaps you would be told to come back at thesame time next week. There were exceptions, many exceptions, the whole ChristianSocialist movement, for example; but, in general, the Protestant clergy actedlike high civil servants, which, after all, is what they were.\"I do not mean to say that the Catholics were better, and there certainly was nomore Catholic resistance to Nazism than there was Protestant. But there was areason for this. The reason—it had both the best and the worst consequences—wasthat the priest was close to the people. After all, he had no more status in theGerman State than they had. In the Catholic villages, in the years after thefirst war, you would not find a Communist; everyone belonged to the CatholicCenter Party; the priests had real power because they were close to the people.In the Evangelical towns it was different, especially where the industrialworkers lived. In Westphalia, for instance, you would find the workers on oneside, the pastor on the other. The pastor did not belong to the people; thepriest did.\"But why, then, you ask, did the Catholics go Nazi? Why didn't the priests holdthem, as they had held them from Communism? The answer is twofold. First,Communism was atheist and Nazism was its enemy, supposedly the defender ofreligion. But there was another reason, andThe Furies: Johann KesslerI'm told that you see this today in Italy and France, where one hears that thereare actually Communist priests. And that is that the masses of the people couldnot be held back from Nazism, so powerful was its appeal, and this same priest,who would not leave his people, went with them to Nazism, too.\"I knew something about all this. My authority was Policeman Willy Hofmeister. In1936 or 1937 each of the Kronenberg detectives was openly assigned to a localchurch as observer, to report on the \"loyalty\" of the sermons. In addition—thisthe detectives were not supposed to know, but they did—there was a Gestapo agentassigned to report on the fidelity of the detective's report. One day, at theheight of the Church-Party struggle, Hofmeister was ordered to inform PastorFaber, whose sermons he reported, that he must not read the pastoral letter sentout by the Protestant bishops to be read from the pulpits on the followingSunday.To Policeman Hofmeister's horror, Pastor Faber coldly told him that the Church,not the State, would decide what was to be read from the pulpit. Hofmeistertried to \"reason\" (he puts it this way, fifteen years later) with the clergymanand told him that there would be a Gestapo agent present and that they wouldboth, Faber and Hofmeister, get into trouble if the pastoral letter were read.Faber said that Hofmeister would have to look out for himself, and rose, endingthe interview.To my amazement, Hofmeister, who had by no means been an ardent Nazi, still,fifteen years later, resented the pastor's defiance of the \"law,\" that is, ofthe authorities. He no more admired Faber's heroism—the letter was read from thepulpit—now than then. He himself, Hofmeister, had violated the \"law,\" that is,what his superiors told himto do, by revealing to the pastor that there would be a Gestapo man present, andthe pastor was willing to jeopardize an innocent man along with himself. \"It waslike a slap in the face/' said Hofmeister, and I saw that even the policemanmight have a hard time of it in the police state.I could not, at first, understand Hofmeister's persistent failure to admire thepastor's great courage. I pressed the matter and learned that the policeman hadalways disliked the great pastor. \"He was too high and mighty for us, a greattheologian, you know, above the people. I was a member of his church, youunderstand. He had been my pastor for years. That did not mean a thing to him.When I went to him—this was years earlier—to ask him to come to the house tochristen my daughter, he said, 'There will be a charge, of course, for coming tothe house/ Like a doctor; worse than a decent doctor.\"After the ceremony, my wife offered Faber and his assistant wine and Torte. Theassistant accepted gladly, but the pastor said \"No,\" he would not have any. Assoon as the assistant finished his wine, Faber said they would have to leave,but I said that the custom was that the guests at a christening must not leaveschief, that is, 'out of balance/ with an odd number of glasses of wine. Theassistant held his glass out, but Faber would not have any. When they wereleaving, I asked the pastor how much it was customary to pay for a christening.He said three Marks, so I laid a three-Mark piece in front of him and afive-Mark note in front of his assistant. That's how I felt, and that's whatkind of Christian the great Faber is/'\"Were they all like that, the pastors in Kronenberg?\"\"More or less. Not all. There was Weber, the one that become a Nazi. He was afriendly man, really beloved, even by those who disagreed with him. Ask anyone.And theThe Furies: Johann KesslerCatholic priest, Father Pausch, there was a man you could talk to. You wouldvisit him, and he'd show you into the parlor, and you'd sit down next to a tableon which there was an open box of cigars. The housekeeper would bring wine andglasses, and the priest would hand you the cigars, and you'd sit and talk withhim, about conditions, yes, even about your problems, although you were not ofhis faith. And he would speak of his troubles. When the government forbade thecontinuation of religious services in the Church schools, Father Pausch acceptedit (what else could he do?) and said to me, 'This is the saddest day of my life/There was a man you could sympathize with, a man like yourself/'So I knew something about the Protestant and the Catholic clergy, at least aboutone Protestant clergyman and one Catholic, the heroic Pastor Faber and theun-heroic Father Pausch, as they appeared to my Protestant friend Hofmeister.What Herr Kessler, the Catholic, or former Catholic, was telling me did notsound at all incredible.\"At the beginning of National Socialism,\" said Herr Kessler, \"there was noeffort to draw people away from the Church. Just the opposite. The WeimarRepublic had separated Church and State, just as it is in America, you know, andthe pastors, most of them, supported the Nazis in the hope of reuniting the twoand rebuilding the Church. Certainly the Party call for 'positive Christianity'was clear, so much so that, in the first days of the regime, many liberals andradicals who had left the Church hurried to join it again as a means of'covering up/ of proving that they were not leftists.\"But by and by the Party's own spirit began by itself to fill up the emptinessof spirit in people's lives. This waswhere the Church had failed. And people began to turn from the Church, which inspirit they had already left, to the Party. The Church blamed the Party forthis, but in the beginning it was not the Party's fault at all. The Churchcreated this vacuum, and the Party, in the end, took advantage of it.\"On the surface there were other things, but that was what lay underneath. Onthe surface the Church-State fight began on the 'Jewish question/ but it isimportant to remember that the fight did not begin for two or three years. TheParty had not expected the Church to take a stand against anti-Semitism as such,and, with some individual exceptions, it didn't. Then the Party made the claimthat baptized Jews, converts to Christianity, were Jews still and had to bedismissed from the clergy and, presumably, thrown out of the Church. Of course,that was a mistake, but the Party had to make it to be consistent. And theChurch had to resist if it were even to maintain the pretense of beingChristian; Christianity is evangelical; its business is to win all souls toChrist.\"Once the fight had begun, the Church leaders blamed the Party for luring thepeople away. Finally that was actually the case, but that was after the troublebegan. And, when a man died who had left the Church, the Church people would sayit was the Party's fault that there was no one to bury him. It would look badfor the Party, you can see that, and I was a Party man.\"\"A Party man first, or a Christian first?\"\"A Party man, then.\"\"And now?\"\"Now?—Nothing. But,\" Herr Kessler went on after a pause, \"it was not just amatter of how it would look for the Party. There was something else. You ask whytheThe Furies: Johann Kesslerhospitals would call the Party office when a soldier died who had left theChurch. It was because people called the Party in all difficulties arising fromthe reconstruction of the country, and the Party always helped. This pattern wasestablished from the first, long before the war. It was what made the Party sostrong—it would always help. In religious matters, in domestic problems, ineverything. It really watched over the lives of the people, not spying on them,but caring about them.\"You know, Herr Professor, we are told that not a sparrow falls without God'scare; I am not being light when I say this—that not a person 'fell/ fell ill orin need, lost his job or his house, without the Party's caring. No organizationhad ever done this before in Germany, maybe nowhere else. Believe me, such anorganization is irresistible to men. No one in Germany was alone in histroubles—\" \"Except,\" I said, \" 'inferior races' and opponents of the regime.\"\"Of course,\" he said, \"that is understood, but they were few, they were outsidesociety, 'over the fence/ and nobody thought about them.\" \"But these, too, were'sparrows/ \" \"Yes,\" he said.\"Could these,\" I said, \"have been 'the least of them/ of whom Jesus spoke?\"\"Herr Professor, we didn't see it that way. We were wrong, sinful, but we didn'tsee it that way. We saw 'the least of them' among our own people, everywhere,among ordinary people who obeyed the laws and were not Jews, or gypsies, and soon. Among ordinary people, 'Aryans/ there were 'the least of them/ too.Millions; six million unemployed at the beginning. These 'least/ not all whowere 'least' but most of them, had somewhere to turn, at last.\"You say, \"Totalitarianism/ Yes, totalitarianism; but perhaps you have neverbeen alone, unemployed, sick, or penniless, or, if you have, perhaps never forlong, for so long that you have given up hope; and so (you'll pardon me, HerrProfessor) it is easy for you to say, Totalitarianism-no/ But the other side,the side I speak of, was the side that the people outside Germany never saw, orperhaps never cared to see. And today nobody in Germany will say it. But,believe me, nobody in Germany has forgotten it, either.\"In the Labor Front every person we placed in a job remained our responsibility,our care. The owner of a caf6 tried to mistreat a girl I had placed there. Shecame to me. I warned him. He did it again, and his business was closed.Totalitarian?—Yes, of course. He was an alter Kampfer, an Old Party Fighter,this man, and at the hearing he said to me, 'You treat me as if I were a Jew.You will lose your job for this/ He took it up with the district office of theParty, without any success. And that was not an exceptional case.Totalitarianism?—Yes. But I am proud of it\"The Party Orator was getting oratorical. \"Yes,\" I said, \"I can understand thatBut—what about your children?\" I had yielded to the temptation to deflate him; Iwas sorry, but it was too late. The Party Orator shriveled, and there was JohannKessler.\"The children/' he said, \"yes, the children.\"\"Excuse me, Herr Kessler/' I said.\"That's all right,\" he said, \"nothing to excuse. The children.\"\"Did your wife say their prayers with them after their first night?\"The Furies: Johann Kessler\"No. I did. I had to, Herr Professor, I had to. They were too young tounderstand, don't you see?'*\"To understand what?\"\"To understand what—what their father was. I had to say their prayers with them,and I could not talk to anyone, not anyone, about it. Not because of the danger,this was not the kind of thing that would ever mean danger, but because of theshame. It was a lonely road; it still is—lonelier, I think, than never to havebelieved at all.\"\"Did you ever pray otherwise?\"\"Yes. At Faith Movement funerals. At the end of my— my talk—you know, about whata good comrade the man had been, what a good husband and father, how true to ourcause and our country, at the end I would say the Lord's Prayer.\"\"Aloud?\"\"Oh, no. But that was different, you know.\"\"How?\"\"Well, what you do to yourself and to God, God can carry, and you yourself don'tmatter. But what you do to your children—.\"He broke off, and I said nothing, and then he went on. \"Every night, all thoseyears, even the last night, before I left home. We were all told to go north, tofight to the end, even the old men. So I started north, on my bicycle, andsurrendered like everyone else. That night, too, when I thought I might not seemy children again, I said their prayers with them, after I had kissed my wife.\"\"What did your wife say?\"\"My wife never said anything about it, ever, after that first night. We didn'ttalk any more about it, in all those years. But she knew.\"\"And you, you knew all the time that you blasphemed?\"\"All the time, I knew all the time that I was damned, damned worse every day.But I wanted my children to be Christians/'\"Why, Herr Kessler?\"\"Why does a man want his children to be better than himself?\"A month after the night her husband left home and was captured, Frau Kesslerwent to the parish priest and asked for Communion for the older child, the girlMaria. She had not been able to locate her husband, and she thought that, evenif he were still alive, she might not see him again; she had heard that anybodywho had been a Party Orator would certainly be classified as a war criminal.Three days later she got word that he was held in the compound at Darmstadt, andshe went to see him. She told him what she had done. He wept. \"Why?\" I asked.\"Because God had had mercy on me, a sinner. I was damned. Whatever I did,whatever they did with me, I was damned. And God had had mercy, even on thedamned.\"\"Can't a man always be saved, Herr Kessler?\"\"I didn't believe that any more. I didn't even believe that. The Faith Movementdenied the Redeemer.\"Every Sunday, now, Herr Kessler's grown daughter and his almost-grown sonworship with the congregation in the parish church. Maria (like so many girls inEurope, and unlike most girls here) plays the violin. Hans, the boy, sings inthe choir with a rich voice like his father's, the Party Orator. The PartyOrator, who now works in the shipping-room of the village feed store, goes tothe church alone and sits at the back, outside the congregation. He has notaskedThe Furies: Johann Kesslerto be readmitted to the faith, and the priest (who himself was a Nazi) shakeshands with him but has never spoken. \"God can wait. He waited for me/' thepriest told Maria, who told me. In the biographical record which Johann Kesslerwrote down for the United States military authorities on July 3, 1945, he giveshis religion as Gottglaubig—non-church-connected believer in God.CHAP TER 17The Furies; Furor TeutonicusWho, asks Tacitus rhetorically, would trade Asia or Africa for Germany, \"aregion hideous and rude, under a rigorous climate, dismal to behold orcultivate?\" The German answer is obvious: the Germans. It's the wrong answer, ofcourse; other people live in still ruder regions without getting into trouble.But for purposes of nationalist romanticism the German answer will serve.Romanticism is the stuff of which men's dreams are made. National Socialism wasa piece of this stuff, cut not from immanent villainy, \"congenital criminality,\"but from the dream of freedom from unbearable conditions which have got to beborne. Since these conditions were more unbearable in Germany than anywhereelse, who but the Germans should undertake, self-sacrificially, to free thehuman race from the human condition?In their dream my friends turned, regretfully, all the way from the Christianobligation to one's fellow-men, with whom, through God, one identifies one'sself, real men in a real world, feeble, fitful men, to the altogethertranscendent obligation (much heavier than that which the Cross imposes) toproduce Man the Imagined, Man like God, Man Who Once Was, German Man. We mustremember that racial perfection was only the means—the means, to be sure —tomoral perfection. Moral perfection was possible. AndThe Furies; Furor Teutonicusmoral perfection, in Germany, would alleviate the human condition everywhere,even among those who, incapable of perfection because of their lower nature,would have to have alleviation forced upon them.Seven of my ten Nazi friends had heard the joke—it originated in Germany duringNazism—and enjoyed it: \"What is an Aryan?\" \"An Aryan is a man who is tall likeHitler, blond like Goebbels, and lithe like Goring.\" They, too, had smiled atthe mass Aryanization, first of the Italians and then of the Japanese. They allknew \"Aryans\" who were indistinguishable from Jews and Jews who wereindistinguishable from Nazis. Six of my ten friends were well below middleheight, seven of them brunet, and at least seven of them brachycephalic, of thecategory of head breadth furthest removed from \"Nordic longheadedness.\" None ofthis mattered; all this was only reality, a parliamentary quibble.The German, said the German philosopher, has a yesterday and a tomorrow, but notoday. Out of my ten Nazi friends, the \"German spirit,\" manifest in the wholeunbroken history of suffering and sacrifice of the whole German people, would,tomorrow at the latest, breed yesterday's German, \"blond, blue-eyed, huge,\" ashe appeared to the Divine Julius, who happened to be dark and squat. Men tooheavy-laden can—and not only can but must-dream such dreams.Wagnerian men like gods and Faustian men like angels people these dreamylives—raise the tailor from his steaming bench, release the farm boy from hisblistering plow handles, fit the burning feet of the shop clerk with wingedsandals, transport them to dark forests (darker in Germany than anywhere else),whence, stripped to sword and shield and helmet, they hew their way to the topof the mountain.There, in a combination Walpurgis-Wartburg, they hurl Teutonic-Christian fire atthe lightning, driving it and its demons away.The incubation of Germany was terrified by das Wii-tende Heer, die Wilde Jagd,the Huntsman's Wild Horde riding the night, and in the sacred groves theprotective fire has never been allowed to die. In 1951 a German mayor burns thede-Nazification records in the town square. In 1952 the Berlin police stage thegreatest torchlight display since Nazism. In 1953 a German pacifist—a pacifist,mind you—burns the \"contractual agreement\" with the Allies in public in Hamburg.And all over Germany, at the fall farm festivals, at the spring schoolfestivals, the climax of the celebration is a fire of orgiastic proportions. In1933 the anti-Christians burned a bonfire of books in Prussia to liberateGermany from the radical Jews; in 1817 the Christians burned a bonfire of booksin Saxe-Weimar to liberate Germany from the reactionary Prussians.On the night of June 29, 1934, Adolf Hitler burned his bridges behind him. Thedecision was made on the terrace of a hotel at Godesberg on the Rhine. Sittingthere alone in the night, the Leader stared at a thousand men on the lawn infront of him; each of the thousand men held a torch; all of the thousand torchestogether formed a fiery Swastika, in his honor. The Leader, staring into thatfire, made the decision to decimate the Party leadership. He left the terrace,commandeered his plane, and flew to Munich at midnight. The next morning wasJune 30, 1934, \"the day of blood/' the nation-wide purge of National Socialism.The world once purged by flood ends always again in the surer purgative of fire.Deviltry runs deep in the \"Teutonic Spirit.\" Those two little devils, \"Max undMoritz,\" the German counterpart of our comic-strip mischief-makers,The Furies: Furor Teutonicusspecialize in enormities undreamed of and undreamable by Peck's Bad Boy, KayoMullins, and Dennis the Menace. And, while it is a long way back from \"Max undMoritz\" to Martin Luther, who invited the Wittenberg students to the burning ofthe Papal bull which split the Church, the way is not trackless. The LutheranReformation, libertarian in its genesis, drove out of the religious life of theGerman people such sunshine as there was in Roman uni-versalism; replaced itwith a gloom which still defies theological permeation; subordinated the ChurchMilitant to the Church Military; and re-established the sect of the patriottribe.It was dreadfully heroic, and dreadfully dramatic, when the Augustinian monksaid, \"Hier stehe zch, ich Icann nicht anders,\" and defied the greatest power onearth. It was less heroic and much less dramatic but no less prophetic of theGermany to come, when he decided that to \"give to him that asketh of thee\" didnot mean to give him what he asks but, rather, what is good for him. It hadtaken a century to convert the English to Christianity, seven to convert theGermans; and in some sections of the land the new faith had died out altogetheras late as the end of the eleventh century.My friend Kessler was right; the resistance of Catholics, not to dictatorship,but to nationalist dictatorship and to racism and idolatry, was stronger, if notsignificantly so, than Protestantism's. The strength of the Catholic Church wasthe strength of the Catholic Church; the strength of the Protestant Church wasthe strength of the German State, whose Church dominated an almost half-Catholiccountry. In the Protestant north one says, \"Guten Tag\"; in the Catholic south,\"Griiss' Gott, God be with you/' It is alittle harder (not much, but a little) to change to \"Heil Hitler\" from \"Griiss'Gott\" than from \"Guten Tag.\"The Catholic Church is, willy-nilly, protestant in a country whose State Churchis Protestant. Bismarck's campaign against it, and later Rosenberg's andGoebbels' (\"We will deal with this crew/' wrote Goebbels of the Catholicism intowhich he was born, \"when the war is over\"), taught Catholics a little aboutliving dangerously and cleaving joyously to a faith under fire. The commonestimate that only 10 per cent of the nominal Protestants of Germany were (andare) free adherents to the State Church is, at least in Kronenberg, not low.Kronenberg had been 100 per cent Catholic until the Prince of Hesse, embracingProtestantism in 1521, suppressed the Catholic worship; from which instant on,Kronenberg had been 100 per cent Protestant. Under the American Occupation,after 1945, the Nazis' Sunday-morning paganism was replaced, in the sametheater, by popular movies during church hours, and without any Protestantprotest.This dark Church of Luther, born not of bread and wine but of blood and iron, soremote from the universal surrender and the universal embrace in which theparent Church was born (if not bred), even in Luther's lifetime lost itslibertarian impulses and has never been able to release the \"little people\" ofGermany from the demonological terrors of the dark. They cannot resist thetorchbearer who, with his torch, turns the black into day. I had several talkswith a country pastor, an anti-Nazi, who, without challenging the one Scripturethat \"we ought to obey God rather than men,\" shook his head doggedly andreverted, again and again, to the other Scripture that \"the powers that be areordained of God.\" His three oldest sons had been killed in the German Armyinvasion of Russia; he will never, heThe Furies: Furor Teutonicussaid in tears, let \"them\" take his last son, Kurt; but I'm afraid he will.So the Tree of Christ, freely planted in the fulfilment of perfect freedom,grows weak and dry beside the Oak of Odin. But it grows; believers andunbelievers and agnostics, big men and little, weak men and strong, good men andbad, left with me the conviction that there was one thing that would have madeNazism even worse than it was: the nonexistence of the Christian Church.Tailor Schwenke may not have known what Christianity was; he may not have been aChristian; he may not have wanted to be; but he could not bear to look in theminor and say, \"I am not a Christian.\" As long as he could not, there was oneway left to his heart, however hard or near-hopeless, that would have beenclosed had there been no Christian Church to claim him. He was, he assured me,'Very religious, always,\" adding, as he always did when he spoke of any of thevirtues, \"Our whole family, always.\" As evidence of his religiosity, he taughtme the hymns his confirmation class had sung sixty years before, Ich will dichlieben, meine Starke (\"I Will Love Thee, My Almighty\") at the beginning of theconfirmation, and So nimm denn meine Hande (\"Take Thou My Hands\") at the end.For a seventy-one-year-old man, who was almost fatally wounded in one war andserved three years in prison after another, his baritone was remarkablybeautiful.\"It was like this,\" he said. 'The new National Socialist faith believed in Godbut not in the divinity of Christ. That's the simplest way to put it\"I thanked him for putting it simply, and he went on. \"We little people didn'tknow whether or not to believe it. 'Is it right, or isn't it? 7 we askedourselves\" (after a thousand years of \"very religious\" Christianity), \"Onebelieved oneway, one another. It wasn't ever decided. Perhaps, if the war had been won, itwould have been decided finally/'\"By whom?\"\"By the men on top. But they didn't seem to have decided yet themselves. A mandidn't know what to think.\"This \"very religious\" old brute was the only one of my nine Protestant friendswho left the Church. But he did not turn to the pagan Faith Movement, nor did heapostasize for religious reasons at all. It seems that in 1934 a fine young SAman wanted to be married (\"He had to be,\" the tailor's wife interrupted) andtold the pastor that he wanted to be married in his fine SA uniform. The pastorrefused. So Tailor Schwenke, now Sturmfuhrer Schwenke, wrote to the pastor thatthe young man did not have enough money to buy a suit. \"Did he?\" I said. \"No,\"said Schwenke. \"Maybe not,\" said Mother Schwenke. The pastor then agreed to theuniform.After the regular service, on the appointed Sunday, Schwenke led his StormTroop, all of them in uniform, into the gallery of the church. When the pastor,who had gone into the sacristy, came out and saw the Storm Troopers, he stood infront of the altar and the waiting couple and said to the congregation, \"Whatkind of business is this?\" Then he performed the ceremony, in brief andunfriendly fashion, and, when it was over and Schwenke tried to speak to him, heturned away.The district Party office, having heard of the incident, suggested that thetailor apologize to the pastor, but he refused. Then the case reached thedistrict Church Council, and the chief pastor summoned the tailor and suggestedthat he apologize. \"He didn't say I had to, so I didn't. But I was disgusted bythe whole thing and resigned my church membership. That's the way I am; ourwhole family's thatThe Furies; Furor Teutonicusway. I started a petition to get that pastor out of his church —his daughter wasmarried to a half-Jew—and a year later he was pensioned. That's all they wantanyway. They just work for a salary and a pension, like everyone else. If theyweren't paid, they wouldn't work/'A few days after this conversation, a local pastor of my acquaintance, who knewI had been talking with the tailor, called on me and asked me if I thought thatHen Schwenke was a Christian, \"a real Christian. I know that that is a peculiarquestion, but his application to re-enter the Church is before the Council\"\"I should guess,\" I said, \"that he's as real a Christian now as he ever was, butit would only be a guess.\"\"That isn't real enough,\" said the pastor.\"Why should he want to re-enter the Church if he isn't a Christian?\" I said.\"Most probably,\" said the pastor, a bright young man, \"to have the Church carryhis Uberfracht, his excess baggage, for him.\"\"Isn't that what the Church is for?\" I said, just as brightly.\"Ah, yes,\" said the bright young pastor, who had recently been to America, \"butthere's so much Uberfracht in Germany. We Germans seem to be born with it,\" andhe handed me an American cigar.PART IIThe GermansHeat WaveIntervening events have driven from all but the hardiest memories the disasterof June 14, 1907, the day that the entire Temperate Zone was hit head on by theworst heat wave in history. Although the suffering of streetcar passengersgenerally was noted in the chronicles of the disaster, one of the most singularincidents (or congeries of incidents) of that singular day was, so far as IJcnow, never reported. The press had, understandably, overlooked the fact thatin those days, and on that day, June 14, the streetcars everywhere in the worldcarried placards which read: \"Windows Are NOT To Be Opened before June 15.\"In downtown Milan, where the cars round the Duomo, an Italian threw a roclcthrough a streetcar window and ran.In Barcelona a Spaniard fell asleep and rode to the end of the line.In Leeds an English rider called the attention of the Yorkshire Post to thesituation, in a strong letter, and, after the letter was picked up in the Times,a Parliamentary debate ensued and the Liberal Government fell—ostensibly on theissue of window regulation.In Graz the streetcar windows were in such bad condition that, although theywere closed, the breeze came through and no Austrian suffocated.The Bucharest Surface Lines were sold to a Turkish syn-Heat Wavedicate reliably reported to represent the interests of the Government of .In Lyon a tram passenger cried \"Libert^/\" and drove his fist through the window.At the sight of his bleeding hand, the Lyonnaise in the dreamy, picturesquePlace de Ville rioted.The Swiss Cabinet, in an emergency session, ordered fans installed at once onall the municipal railways.In the Scandinavian capitals it was cool, even muggy.In Omaha an American opened the streetcar window.In Hannover a German, having read the placard and consulted his mechanicalpocket calendar, sat back comfortably in his seat, kept his coat on, and readhis paper; but that evening he beat his small son, who, twenty years later,joined the NSDAP, or National Socialist German Workers' Party.CHAPTER 1 8There Is No Such ThingIt is an article of the modern faith—an article all the more hotly held for itsdubiety—that there is no such thing as national character. Nothing may be saidabout a whole people, e.g., in America about Negroes, Jews, or Catholics. Thisarticle, like others of older faiths, may, of course, be (and everywhere is)suspended for the duration of war. George Washington said that the NewEnglanders were \"an exceedingly dirty and nasty people\"; Alexander I of Russiasaid that the French were \"the common enemy of Humanity\"; and Dr. JosephGoebbels said that the English \"are a race of people with whom you can talk onlyafter you have first knocked out their teeth.\" That such things are said notmerely by civilized people in uncivilized times or by uncivilized people incivilized times may be seen in the observation of General Nathan DeWitt, theWest Coast Area Commander of the United States Army, in 1942: \"A Jap is a Jap.It makes no difference whether he is an American citizen or not. You can'tchange him by giving him a piece of paper. The Japanese race is an enemy race.\"Between 1933 and 1945 the most curious things—some of them wrong, as things saidin partisan passion sometimes are—were said of the whole German people. Whilethe political consequences of some of the things that were said wereunfortunate, I think it was right to generalize aboutThere Is No Such Thingthe Germans. There is such a thing as national character, even though the Nazissaid there is.This is not to say that the character is bounded by national, racial, orreligious boundaries or that every member of the nation, race, or religioninvolved displays the character in the same degree or even in any degree. It isonly to say that a sufficiently pronounced outlook—and inlook—is to be found ina sufficiently large proportion of Slobovians everywhere to manifest itselfdecisively in the behavior of Slobovians generally and of Slobovia as a nation;and this in spite of the radical differences among the Slobovian tribesthemselves. It is only to say that we are justified in at least looking forsomething common, and even peculiarly common, in, say, the Germans.What we find, in the way of national character, certainly does not entitle anywhole people to do anything to any other whole people, no whole people havingshown any moral superiority over any other during the whole of their collectiveexistence. The woman who made a lampshade of the skin of innocent Jews was aGerman, but the man who made a blanket of the scalps of innocent Indians was anAmerican. If every American did not so distinguish himself, neither did eveiyGerman. And, if there were only one innocent German or one innocent American,the greatest wrong would inhere in associating the fact of national characterwith the right or, worse yet, the duty to do something to all of the nationals.Burke did not say, in behalf of the American colonists, that he could not bringhimself to characterize a whole people; he said that he could not bring himselfto indict them.Nor does it follow from the fact of national character that the characteristicsare either innate or indelible. The Roman character certainly changed betweenRomulus andRomulus Augustus. The Spaniards were the terror of the world, a few centuriesback; and so, a little later, were the Swedes. And the Americans were oncesober, devout, and penurious. \"Much learned trifling,\" says Gibbon in one of hissavage little footnotes, \"might be spared, if our antiquarians would condescendto reflect that similar manners will naturally be produced by similarconditions.\"The distinguished Englishman who not so long since accused the German people ofcongenital criminality overlooked the view of respectable English historiansthat the main stream of the English character is not Celtic at all but Germanic,not to mention the London Times of November 11, 1870, which carried thefollowing Letter to the Editor:\"That noble, patient, deep, pious and solid Germany should be at length weldedinto a Nation, and become Queen of the Continent, instead of vapouring,vainglorious, gesticulating, quarrelsome, restless, and over-sensitive France,seems to me the hopefulest public fact that has occurred in my time.—I remain,Sir, Yours truly, T. Carlyle,\"It is not necessarily mischievous to speculate about the cause and the cure ofthe Germans, nor need such speculation involve either Germanophilia orGermanophobia. As the dust unsettles in Europe, Germany and the Germans haveagain emerged as the first order of unfinished, and probably unfinishable,business. If, in the present division of the world, Germany were united, fordespotism or for constitutional government, there would be a substantial basisfor predicting the near future of Europe and perhaps of the world. But Germanyis divided, the Germans are divided, and the German is divided. Sixty millionGermans are the bloodless battleground of prewar peace. The battlers have notime to inquire into the character of the prize they pursue, even though suchinquiry might facilitate their pur-There Is No Such Thingsuit. To them, in their respective hurries, Germany is so many bases, so muchproduction or production potential, and so many units of so many men. ButGermany, like Russia, America, or Slobovia, is something special. Germany is theGermans.The national behavior of Germany between 1933 and 1945—and, it would seem, ofmost Germans—indicates a character that is just about as unattractive as acharacter can be. Among the million or so who ran, or tried to run, away fromNational Socialism, there were many who opposed it on principle. Maybe a millionmore fought it, or tried to fight it, from within. A few million more didn'tlike it. But so many Germans liked it (and not just some of it, but all of it)that it may justly be said to have represented the predominant nationalcharacter of the time. And National Socialism, made in Germany, out of theGerman character, is the worst thing that modem man has made.Worse, certainly, than Communism; for it is not the performance of politicalsystems which justifies or condemns them, but their principles. Communism, inprinciple, supposes itself to represent the wretched of the earth and bars noman by nature from Communist redemption; the Nazis, in categorical contrast,took themselves to be the elite of the earth and consigned whole categories ofmen to perdition by their nature. The distinctions between these twototalitarianisms may not command much interest in the present temper of theWestern Christian; they are still distinctions.National Socialism could have happened elsewhere in the modem world, but ithasn't yet. Up to now it is unique to Germany. And the deception andself-deception it required were required of a people whose civilization, bycommon measurement, was very highly advanced. Germanmusic and art, German belles-lettres and philosophy, German science andtechnology, German theology and education (especially at the highest levels)were part and parcel of Western achievement. German honesty, industry, familyvirtue, and civil government were the pride of other Western countries whereGermans settled. \"I think,\" says Professor Carl Hermann, who never left hishomeland, \"that even now the outside world does not realize how surprised wenon-Nazis were in 1933. When mass dictatorship occurred in Russia, and then inItaly, we said to one another, 'That is what happens in backward countries. Weare fortunate, for all our troubles, that it cannot happen here/ But it did,worse even than elsewhere, and I think that all the explanations leave somemystery. When I think of it all, I still say, with unbelief, 'Germany—no, notGermany/ \"The Germans resist all ready-to-hand analysis of social behavior. Everyimportant factor in their development has been present in the development ofother peoples who have not, at least recently, behaved themselves as badly asthe Germans. To say that they were Christianized late is too easy; so were theScandinavians. To say that the notion of equality, connected or unconnected withChristianity, is new to Germany will not do, either; the Peasant Wars of thesixteenth century were certainly egalitarian. The Germans were nationalizedlate, it is true, but so were the Swiss, comparatively, and the Italians werejust as late. Industrialism was a century late coming to Germany, but it waslater still coming to Czechoslovakia and Finland, and it hasn't reached Indiayet.All these tardinesses are, applied to the Germans, marginal or, at best,inconclusive. There is only one easy inference left—that there is something notjust different, but uniquely different, about the Germans. The minor conse-There Is No Such Thingquence of this easy inference is the proliferation of theories about theGermans, and of studies to bolster or undo them. This proliferation has reachedthe point where being studied is the most crowded single profession in Germany.The foreigner (except the Frenchman, who is immune to the Germans) cannot spenda week in the country without coming down with a pernicious case of theory.But the major consequence of this inference is something much moredreadful—namely, its acceptance by the Germans themselves. And the Germans donot, as we know, go half-hog about anything. The theory—passion, rather; forthat is what theory becomes when it falls into German hands—that there issomething different about the Germans was the wellspring of National Socialism.But it pervades German culture, Nazi, non-Nazi, anti-Nazi, and pre-Nazi. Itposits the existence of a \"German spirit 7 ' as something apart and, above all,very interesting. Croce, a \"confessed Germanophile,\" observing everywhere inGermany the inscriptions deutsche Treue, deutsche Tapferfceit, deutscheGrossmut, German fidelity, German valor, German generosity, wryly decided thatthe Germans had \"confiscated for themselves all the common human virtues/'And, as Germans ascribed a spirit to themselves, so they infused other peopleswith other, non-German and (on the basis of local pride) inferior spirits. Thebehavior of Jews was not to be understood in mundane terms or differentiated asbetween Jew and Jew; the \"Jewish spirit,\" a notion nebulously supported bymisreading the ancients from Moses to Esdras, was adequate to explain thebehavior of Jews. And when the behavior of a Jew—or of an Englishman or of acrocodile—was good, as it once in a great while was, and could not be explainedby the spirit peculiar to the species involved, it was dismissed as aberration.Therest of the world, falling victim to the \"German spirit'' fantasy, finally, inan equal and opposite reaction, accepted it as something existent, apart, veryinteresting, and, on the whole, objectionable.This \"German spirit,\" taken to the German heart as innate and indelible,created, as any such concept must, a world independent of common sense and ofcommon experience. This \"German spirit\" created German philosophic idealismuninhibited by history as surely as it created German racism uninhibited bybiology. But what created the \"German spirit'7CHAPTER 19The Pressure CookerI have a friend, in America, with whom I once discussed the question of theindeterminate prison sentence for felonies. Himself an opponent of prisonsentences of all kinds, he was by way of being a firsthand authority in thefield of penology; in his time he had left a half-dozen jails and penitentiarieswithout, as he put it, permission. When I met him, he was on his way to theInstitution for the Criminally Insane at Menard, Illinois. Nobody could breakout of Menard. My friend did, a few months later, and when I last heaiu of himhe was at Alcatraz.'Til tell you/' said Basil Banghart, for that was his name, \"what's wrong withthe indeterminate sentence. If you tell me to pick up a big rock and carry it,and I say, 'Where to?' and you say, To that pile over there/ and the pile is amile, or two miles, or five miles away, and I say, 'And then can I put it down?and you say, 'Yes/ I can pick it up and carry it But if I say, 'Where to?' andyou say, 'Until I tell you you can put it down/ why, I can't budge it. Mycondition then is that of a native I met in the United States Penitentiary onMarietta Avenue in Atlanta, Georgia; I am just too po' to tote it.\"Every one of my ten National Socialist friends, and a great majority of all theGermans I met, no matter what their political history, their wealth, theirstatus, or theircultivation, all seemed to me to be somehow overloaded with t/berfracht, excessbaggage, which, in the words of Basil Banghart's native, they were too po\" totote. There seems to be something heavy about the Germans—not, to be sure, aboutall of them, and not in the same degree or in the same form in those who are.How many of them are heavy? How heavy are they? I don't know. I can't imagine.All I know is (as every tourist has observed who has ever got out of the bus)that there seems to be something heavy about the Germans.Their dumplings, their liturgy, their Blitzkrieg are heavy. So is their humor;they even have a word for the enjoyment of another's misfortune. Their bowingand scraping are heavy, and their operas (and especially their light operas).Their poetry, too, Goethe almost alone excepted (and not always he; read hisErl&onig). Fantasists have even said that their women's legs—Marlene Dietrichbeing the exception here, as Goethe is in poetry—are heavy.We are in an uproar; our German friends pound the table (we make a note of thefact that they pound the table) and ask if we are to understand that Mozart isheavy? No, we are not; we are to understand that he came from Vienna. Are we tounderstand that Stefan Georg is heavy? No, we are not; we are to understand thathe was exiled to Switzerland. What do we mean by talking about \"the Germans\"?How would we like it if somebody said that \"the Americans\" are money-mad? (A cryof, \"They are,\" is heard above the uproar.) How would we like it?— Not at all,but how are we to judge our own madness?Why is the Germans' politics so desperately heavy; their scholarship somarvelously heavy; their philosophy, with Will, Duty, and Destiny its centralterms, even heavier than their public law and their public fountains? TheirThe Pressure Cookerlanguage—what is there left to say after Mark Twain's The Awful GermanLanguage?—is so deadly heavy that it cannot be got under way without beingpushed from behind. Strc prst skrz Jerk, which is Czech for, 'Tut your fingerthrough your throat/' is a bit heavy, to be sure, but Die, die die, die dieApfel gestohlen haben, anzeigen, is a no less impossible way of saying, inGerman, \"Whoever reports the apple thieves.\"You may not say of the Germans (as you do of the Swedes) that you find themdull, for the Germans are capable of the wildest excursions; or (as you do ofthe Swiss) that you find them smug, for the Germans are most uneasy; or (as youdo of the English) that the Germans are pompously reserved, for German pomposityis always assertive (for centuries the high bust has been known to Parisdressmakers as a la prussienne); or (as you do of the Russians) that they arestolid (or, when they're on our side, stoical), for the Germans complaincontinuously. There is supposed to be something fascinating about the moodinessof the Hungarians; in the Germans this moodiness is manic-depressive, anddepressing. What there is about the Germans, let them march or dance, let themroar or sing, is something heavy.The German's hand is heavy, on his wife and children, on his dog, on himself, onhis enemies. His heel is heavy, as we know, and his tread, even when he ismushroom-picking-bent in the woods, is heavy. His woods and his winters, hiswhole world, are heavy. The German—with, naturally, some several millions ofexceptions, including whole provinces—seems to be a heavy, heavy man. How do apeople live with the Danes on one side, the French on another, the Poles onanother, and the Austrians and Italians on another, and develop a state of beingat suchextraordinary variance with their neighbors? Only the North Swiss and theRhenish Dutch, both of whom love nothing less than being taken for Germans, aremuch like them.This catalogue of German characteristics is, of course, a moderately madexaggeration. The whole gamut of variations in persons and places is ignored.German Moselwein is as light as French Moselle across the river; and Goethe andDietrich are Germans and, had they lived in the same time and town, might havebeen very good friends. Who has not seen a Scotsman or a Bengal with a singleplane from his clavicle to his occiput—or a German likewise constructed withoutsaying, \"Look at that German's neck?\" Let us say, then, that there seems to besomething heavy about the Germans.This heaviness has a character of its own. It is not solidity, for the Germansare the most volatile of human compounds; nor is it rest, for the Germans arethe eagerest of beavers. It is not a dead weight which has gone just about asfar as it can go and has made its peace with gravity. It has, rather, a livingcharacter, exerting a perpetual push and implying a perpetual restraint, like abuttressed wall. It betrays pressure and consequent counterpressure, whichbetween them seem to me to account (better, at least, than any other crudenotion) for German autocracy within and German aggression without.We are speaking, of course, of living substances, persons; and the analogy ofthe \"German spirit\" with centripetal and centrifugal interaction is (besidesbeing obvious) bound to be imperfect. Any explanation of human behavior in termsof a single condition, or set of conditions, is oversimplified anyway, andprobably unsound. But no durable harm should issue from the pursuit of theanalogy if, whileThe Pressure Cookerwe pursue it, we remember that analogy and will-o'-the-wisp are cousins.To try to account for human behavior on the basis of pressure andcounterpressure requires the antecedent recognition that psychological pressureis just as real as \"real\" pressure. The Germans have, to begin with, more thantheir share of \"real\" pressure. I am sorry to have to say that Hitler said thatGermany was encircled, because I am sorry to have to say that Hitler was right.Germany has more frontiers—and they are \"soft\" frontiers—and more historicallydissimilar neighbors than any other nation on earth. Its people first knew andbecame known to the world through the hostile invasion of their land.It has, by being prepared to invade, and by invading, been defending itselfagainst this invasion, unconsciously since the Spanish succession to the HolyRoman Empire, consciously since the destruction of the Empire by Napoleon. Atthe Peace of Pressburg, in 1805, the full focus of European pressure finallyfell upon the future German nation, and there it remains. From Richelieu toBarthou the first principle of French policy was the encirclement of Germany;the mortality of \"Schuman Plan\" ministries in France since the first fine flushof post-1945 rapprochement suggests that the principle is still operative.The North Sea, far from being an open coast, has been the \"northern front\"against Germany since the seventeenth century. A hostile Denmark and anunfriendly (and often hostile) Netherlands pressed in upon that one Germanoutlet, with England and Sweden behind them. The French seized it in theeighteenth century, and the English sealed it in the nineteenth. The first WorldWar ended with the \"central powers,\" that is, Germany, more central thanever—doubly encircled, geographically by thepartition of Austria-Hungary and the erection of Czechoslovakia and theCorridor, politically by the world alliance which excluded Germany and Russia.It was not anti-Semitism or socialism or the New Order that first animated theNazis; their first slogan was, \"Break the chains of Versailles/' Der alte Fritzhad broken the circle, by making peace with Russia in 1756, before it was quitecompleted; der Heine Adolf had to begin with the circle closed.In 1888 Wilhelm II, then Crown Prince, wrote to Bismarck that Russia was \"merelywaiting for the favorable moment to attack us in alliance with the [French]Republic.\" Bismarck disagreed, but the year before, as insurance against atwo-front war, he had made his secret treaty with the Tsar, agreeing to supportthe latter's occupation of the entrance to the Black Sea. \"I wake up screaming/'he wrote later, when Wilhelm accused him of being pro-Russian, \"when I dream ofour Russian alliance failing/' He had reason to; his dismissal, and Wilhelm'sabandonment of his policy, brought the French-Russian entente into being and thedestruction of Imperial Germany.What the rest of the world knows as German aggression the Germans know as theirstruggle for liberation. And this liberation has no more to do with individualliberty than it has in Poland or Abyssinia or South Korea—nothing whatever. \"Idon't want what belongs to nobody else,\" says the peasant in the story, \"I onlywant what fines mine.\" Every aggression is a defense—at worst, a prematuredefense—including that of September 1, 1939. Were not the French and theEnglish, in July and August, making frantic overtures to Moscow, to tighten thecircle of Europe? Were they letting their ideological differences with theCommunists embarrass them? Why should the Germans? Who (except, of course, theinnocents who read and writeThe Pressure Cookerthe newspapers) could suppose that ideology had anything to do with it? Twelvehard years later Herr Schumacher, the Social Democratic leader, arose in theGerman Bundestag to say, \"The German military contribution makes sense if theworld democracies will defend Germany offensively to the east.\"\"Defend Germany offensively/' Wilhelm's plea for \"a place in the sun\" isidentical with Hitler's for \"living space.\" In 1914 the great German economybestrode the Continent; in 1939 Germany's population density was lower thanEngland's. The problem had something, but only something, to do with populationdensity and economics, still less with colonies. Germany's need was eveiy placein the sun, all the living space. The man who dreams that he can't breathe in atelephone booth can't breathe in a circus tent. Bismarck's nightmare is theperpetual nightmare of Germany.Proponents of the theory of aggression as a conscious, purposive pattern ofGerman history—still more, those who propound it as German nature—have alwayshad a hard time explaining Bismarck's indifference to both colonial expansionand Pan-Germanism. He armed Germany to the steepletops, created a naked powerstate faster than any man in history except Friedrich Wilhelm I and AdolfHitler, and what was his purpose? His purpose never wavered; with power and evenwith war as his means, it was the perpetuation of the German Reich which he sawhimself as having completed.External pressure—real or imaginary, it doesn't matter which—produced thecounterpressures of German rigidity and German outbreak, the ordered, explosivepropensity of the pressure cooker. How rigid will the rigidity be, how big theoutbreak? The answer is: How great is the pressure?Ask the carrot in the cooker how far out it wants to go, or the German dictatorto set a limit to his requirements. The transition from the Lincolnian sentimentof Deutsch-land (iber Alles, \"The Union above the States/' to its latter-dayimplication of world domination was inevitable; there is no basis for supposingthat the Germany we have known recently would stop short of world domination, orstop there. How much air does the man in the nightmare need when he cries out,\"I can't breathe\"?What do we find inside the pressure cooker, among the carrots? We find theperfect pattern of organization, be it in the street-cleaning department, theChurch, or the concentration camp, in the Hegelian order of the morally absoluteState or the Kantian order of the morally absolute universe. Who has everreached for the stars like the Germans, breaking asunder the bindings of realitythat constrict the human heart and restrain that teetering creature, thereasonable man? Reality's ambivalence makes Hamlets—cowards, say Hamlet andHitler, who burned Hamlet—of us all. Hitler cut all the knots that freemenfumble with. He did not resolve the problems that immobilized his people; hesmashed them. He was the grand romantic. I asked my friend Simon, the\"democratic\" bill-collector, what he liked best about Hitler. \"Ah,\" he said atonce, \"his 'So—oder so/ his 'Whatever I have to do to have my way, I will havemy way/ \"CHAPTER 20'Teoria fiber ADes\"Take Germany as a city cut off from the outside world by flood or fire advancingfrom every direction. The mayor proclaims martial law, suspending councildebate. He mobilizes the populace, assigning each section its tasks. Half thecitizens are at once engaged directly in the public business. Every privateact—a telephone call, the use of an electric light, the service of aphysician—becomes a public act. Every private right—to take a walk, to attend ameeting, to operate a printing press—becomes a public right. Every privateinstitution—the hospital, the church, the club—becomes a public institution.Here, although we never think to call it by any name but pressure of necessity,we have the whole formula of totalitarianism.The individual surrenders his individuality without a murmur, without, indeed, asecond thought—and not just his individual hobbies and tastes, but hisindividual occupation, his individual family concerns, his individual needs. Theprimordial community, the tribe, re-emerges, its preservation the first functionof all its members. Every normal personality of the day before becomes an\"authoritarian personality.\" A few recalcitrants have to be disciplined(vigorously, under the circumstances) for neglect or betrayal of their duty. Afew groups have to be watched or, if necessary, taken in hand—the antisocialelements, theliberty-howlers, the agitators among the poor, and the known criminal gangs. Forthe rest of the citizens—95 per cent or so of the population—duty is now thecentral fact of life. They obey, at first awkwardly but, surprisingly soon,spontaneously.The community is suddenly an organism, a single body and a single soul,consuming its members for its own purposes. For the duration of the emergencythe city does not exist for the citizen but the citizen for the city. The harderthe city is pressed, the harder its citizens work for it and the more productiveand efficient they become in its interest. Civic pride becomes the highestpride, for the end purpose of all one's enormous efforts is the preservation ofthe city. Conscientiousness is the highest virtue now, the common good thehighest good. (Is it any wonder that the German people, whose nation disordersthe world, have established the world's best-ordered cities, the Milwaukees ofAmerica as well as of Germany?)What if the emergency persists, not for weeks, months, or even years, but forgenerations and for centuries? Unrelieved sacrifice requires compensation in theonly specie available. Peoria—let Peoria be our beleaguered city—is seen, littleby little, to be different from Quincy, Springfield, Decatur. It is somethingspecial to be a Peorian, something, if say so we must, heroic. Tales of thefounding of Peoria, once taken lightly, reveal that our city was no ordinarycity to begin with. Legends turn out to be true. No wonder Peoria sticks it out,sees it through; see the stuff Peorians are made of, always were. Peorians aresuperior people, superior blood and superior bone; their survival proves it.Their ancestors, they recall, established the city against the most fearfulodds; their descendants will deliver it\"Peoria iiber AHes\"against odds more fearful still. There will be a New Peoria, a Greater Peoria, aThousand-Year Peoria. The world will ring with its timeless fame, kneel at itstopless towers. And Peoria will be a model to mankind; Peorian courage, Peorianendurance, Peorian patriotism—these will be a model to a world that, because ithas never been tried like Peoria, has grown soft, decadent, plutocratic, hasfallen prey to rot and to the parasites that rot carries with it.And whom, meanwhile, among Peorians, have we called to the helm in our hour, ouraeon, of struggle, in our place of danger?—Peorians who are tried and true, menwho have served their city and never disserved it, men who have represented thebest of Peoria to the world, who have always known its glories and extolledthem. We want the Old Guard, not the avant-garde; the doers, not thedo-nothings; the clear thinkers, not the skeptics; the believers in Peoria, notthe complainers and the cranks. We don't want the men who always wanted to makePeoria over and who see our trial as their opportunity; this, of all times, isno time for divisiveness.The things that a country honors will be cultivated there. What shall we teachthe young Peorians, who will follow us? What life shall we hold out to them asthe highest life? —Why, the life they will have to live to deliver their city,in a Peoria oppressed and encircled. The flabby and effete must go, and with itthe dabbling, the faddism, the free thinking that squander our people's time andtheir energies, divert them from the overriding need of their city, and debasetheir tastes and their morals. Peorianism is, as Daniel Webster would have said,foursquare, rock-ribbed, copper-sheathed; red-blooded; undoubting and undivided;staunch, stern, rugged, simple, brave, clean, and true. Everyinfluence on our people (above all, on our young people) will be Peorian.We Peorians cannot live as others. We would not if we could. See them—Quincy,Springfield, Decatur—hopelessly unprepared for a struggle such as ours, withtheir niggling parliamentarism (the Lend-Lease debate; the Army-McCarthyhearings), their democratic corruptionism (Teapot Dome; the five-per-centers),their corrosive individualism (Tommy Manville; H. D. Thoreau). See themfattening while Peoria hungers. See them exploiting Peoria's prostration.Quincy, Springfield, Decatur, have always hated Peoria. Why? The answer issuddenly obvious: because we are better than they are.Why do the Poles, egged on by the English, or the Serbs, egged on by theRussians, begin these world wars against Germany? The chauvinist braggadocio ofmy ten Nazi friends—excluding the teacher and, to a lesser degree, thecabinetmaker and the bank clerk—was of an order, I thought at first, that I hadnever before encountered. And then I remembered: the \"new boy\" in theneighborhood at home, on the Calumet Avenue of my childhood, ringed round by theneighborhood gang and trying to brazen it out alive. \"Betcha my father can beatyour father/' Betcha my fatherland can beat yours,\"The whole world has always been jealous of Germany/' said my friend thebill-collector, \"and why not?—We Germans are the leaders in everything/'\"We Germans/ 7 said my friend the tailor, the only one of the ten who deservedto be called an ignoramus, and a lazy ignoramus to boot, \"are the mostintelligent people in the world, and the hardest working. Is it any wonder thatthey hate us? Have you ever seen a Jew or an Englishman work when he didn't haveto?\"\"Peoria iiber Alles\"\"Twice we have had to fight the whole world, all alone,\" said the baker. \"Whatgood are the Italians or the Japanese?\"But I could always count on the tailor to go the whole hog: \"We won both wars,and both times we were betrayed.\"CHAPTER 2 1New JBoy in the NeighborhoodGermany is the \"new boy\" in the neighborhood of the Western world. The onedurable consequence of the first World War was the unification of a Germany someof whose states, up until then, had their own kings and courts, their ownarmies, ambassadors, and postal systems. And even the war did not complete theunification; Bavaria and Prussia, which hated one another, both defied theWeimar Republic with impunity, the one from the right, the other from the left.Nationhood was nominally forced upon the dozens of \"Sovereign German States\" in1871 by Prussia, of which the King of Wiirttemberg had said, a half-centuryearlier, \"Prussia belongs as little to Germany as does Alsace/' The nonexistentGermany of 1870 was composed entirely of foreigners, ethnically and historicallyso hodgepodged that an East Prussian or a Bavarian was just as likely to betaken for a Pole or an Austrian as for a German. Only by his language could aGerman be distinguished, and not always then; Low and High German are asmutually unintelligible as German and Dutch.The language itself—a Mischmasch, Leibniz called it-reflected the Germanmiscegenation, the \"disgrace\" which the elite passed on to the populace. \"I havenever read a German book,\" the greatest of all German heroes boastedNew Boy in the Neighborhoodat the end of the eighteenth century; and his friend Voltaire wrote home fromthe Prussian court, \"We all talk French. German is left for soldiers and horses/7 Pre-Nazi nationalism tried to drive \"loan\" words out of the language—evenuniversal European terms like Telefon—and Nazi nationalism intensified thecampaign. But in vain; German remained a Mischmasch.German nationalism was, and still is, the effort to create a German nation. Theindependence of the old German States had its merits, in spite of the ridiculousfragmentation it perpetuated and the dozens of ossified nobilities and theirclumsy Ruritania courts in imitation of a Versailles long gone. Cultureflourished (to be sure, at the whim of whimsical princes), but it was under suchprinces, and with their self-serving patronage, that German culture was great.It would be very nice, said Goethe to Ecker-man, to cross the thirty-six Stateswithout having one's trunk examined thirty-six times, \"but if one imagines theunity of Germany with a single large capital for the whole nation, and that thisgreat capital would encourage the development of genius or contribute to thewelfare of the people, he is wrong/'The nationalization of Germany, although it came too late to perform thehistoric function it performed everywhere else, was not to be stopped. When theliberal philosopher Feuerbach wrote his friend Friedrich Kapp, \"I would not givea row of pins for unity unless it rests on liberty/' Kapp, a \"Forty-eighter,\"who had left his Fatherland to find liberty, wrote back from America: \"To besure, it is disagreeable that Bismarck, and not the democrats, achieved thismagnificent consolidation, that the reactionary Junkers and bureaucrats of oldPrussia rule. But arenot the results achieved, and does It matter who is responsible for such a greatachievement?''Germany was a nation, but in 1871 it was prematurely a nation; in 1914 and in1918 still prematurely. Like all parvenus, the German nation had, and still has,a compulsion to display its wealth, its nationhood, and a desperate terror oflosing it, not of being broken apart from without, but, more terribly, offalling apart within. Englishmen and Frenchmen know that they are Englishmen andFrenchmen; when I asked a Danish Communist whether, in his heart, he was a Daneor a Communist, he said, \"What a silly question; every Dane is a Dane.\" But theGerman has to be reassured that he is a German. The German pressure cookerrequired, and still requires, the fierce, fusing fire of fanaticism under it.Russia and the United States of America have both, until recently, at least,been spared this peculiar experience of German nationalism, partly because oftheir longer national history, partly because of their isolation. Like the othertwo \"Pans,\" Pan-Slavism and Pan-Americanism, expansionist Pan-Germanism is thenone-too-paradoxical consequence of the dread of decomposition. As long as theself-consciously fragile German nation is threatened, internally no less thanexternally, it will threaten the world, and foreign statesmen who divide theGermans into our friends and their friends would do well to be mindful thatthose Germans who are neither, or who are one today and the other tomorrow, arethinking of Germany, not of Democracy or Communism.Just as German nationalism was the effort to create a nation, so German racismwas the effort to create a race out of a geographical group none of whosestocks, according to all the available pre-Nazi measurements, was Nordic.New Boy in the NeighborhoodEthnical heterogeneity is greater among the Germans (taking the Austrians asGermans) than it is among any other of the world's peoples except the Russiansand the Americans.True, my ten friends, not one of whom met or even approached the Nordicstandard, rejected their own \"Aryan-ism.\" But they did accept a kind of racist\"Germanism/' a biologized mystique which, I was surprised to discover, they werenot alone in accepting. A university graduate of the pre-Nazi era, an anti-Naziintellectual, when I asked her how many Jews there were still in Kronenberg,said, \"Almost none—but, then, you would have to take biological as well ashistorical and religious data to find out exactly/'My friend Simon, he of the secret Talmud, when he told me that, yes, the JewSpringer was a decent man, and I asked him how there could be a decent Jew whenthe \"Jewish spirit\" was a matter of blood, replied: \"Of course it's a matter ofblood. It might skip a generation\"— he had certainly not read Mendel—\"but itwould show up in the next. Only when the proportion of Jewish blood is smallenough will it no longer be a danger to Deutschtum.\" \"How small,\" I said, \"wouldit have to be?\" \"The scientists have that worked out,\" he said.Herr Simon was not alone in his preoccupation with \"pollution.\" The tailor'sson, Schwenke, spoke frequently of the \"race injury,\" the relations between\"Aryans\" and \"non-Aryans\" of opposite sexes, the special province of the NaziSS. He and Simon both told me, in some genuine terror, mixed, I felt, with someof the titillation always involved in discussing sexual relations, that Jewishhouseholders invariably hired \"German\" housemaids (this much was true, sincehousemaids came largely from the peasantor unskilled working classes), for the express purpose of \"ruining\" them.Neither Schwenke nor Simon, of course, had any evidence.Once—as far as I could learn, only once—a Jew was seen walking through thestreets of Kronenberg wearing a sandwich-board sign reading, Ich habe einaryanisches Madchen beschandet, \"I have ruined an Aryan maiden/'\"No one looked at him/' said Policeman Hofmeister.\"Why?\"\"Everyone felt sorry for him/'\"Why?\"\"Because it was such—such nonsense.\"\"Nonsense?\"\"Yes. Here's a Jewish boy. He has a German\"—non-Jewish, the policemanmeant—\"girl friend. They quarrel. That can happen. They call each other names,then threaten each other. Now they hate each other, although maybe they arestill in love; you know, that can happen, Herr Professor. She threatens todenounce him. He dares her to, and she does. And then this—this nonsense.\""},{"pageContent":"Policeman Hofmeister was less remorseful about the gypsies, whose treatment was,if anything, more horrible than that of the Jews and who had no voice anywherein all the world to cry out for them. The gypsies, said Policeman Hofmeister,who would not have said this about the Jews, were Menschen zweiten Grades,second-class humans, submen. \"The idea,\" he said, \"was to preserve the puregypsies,\" the biologically pure, that is, \"to preserve them intact, if possible,although, of course, outside the framework of German rights. But the gypsyMischlinge, the mongrels, the half-breeds, were a great danger to the race,through intermingling. Gypsy blood\"—I thought of the waltz—\"was bad. Still\"—herewas a good man speaking, whoNew Boy in the Neighborhoodthought he believed in \"blood\" and not in social determinants—\"one felt sorryfor them, for the conditions in which they had to live, without homes or townsor decent provisions for their children. How could they help themselves?\"\"You will have to admit, Herr Professor/' said Baker Wedekind, \"that Hitler gotrid of the beggars and the gypsies. That was a good thing. The gypsies had lotsof children, charming children, too, whom they taught to cheat and steal. In thevillage, in my childhood, we locked our doors when gypsies were there;otherwise, never. They were an alien race, alien blood.\" He, too, would not havesaid that I should have to admit that Hitler had done a good thing in gettingrid of the Jews.I think that what worried Policeman Hofmeister and Baker Wedekind was their owncommon knowledge. The achievements of Jews in every field in which the \"Germans\"excelled gave rise to an essentially schizoid condition in my friends. Theinferior race, the Jews, was also, like the Germans themselves, superior. Thegypsies would have made a better Devil for German racism, if only the Devil werenot, by definition, superhuman as well as inferior. The gypsies were adequatelyinferior, but they were not, in German terms, superhuman. They were, quiteliterally, such poor Devils. The Jew would have to do—if he could bedistinguished from the German.CHAPTER 22Two New Boys in the NeighborhoodIn other countries governments have been willing to foment and exploit—butalways deplore—anti-Semitism. In Germany, and in Germany alone, was it made thecornerstone of public policy. Why? The peculiar ferocity of civil war, the warof brother against brother, comes to mind as hypothesis. The hypothesis is notoriginal; Rauschning says that Hitler once told him that the Germans and theJews could not live together because they were too much alike.The Germans and the Jews are wonderfully alike. There are, of course, great andobvious differences between them, because the Jews are few, scattered, ancientlycivilized, and southern in origin, while the Germans are many, concentrated,primitive, and northern. That the Jew is tasteful and epicurean, more so thanthe German, is the mere consequence of his geographical origin and his culturalage. That he is subtle, much more so than the German, is the mere consequence inpart of his geographical origin, in part of his defenselessness. That hispassion for individual independence is exalted, as the German's is not, is themere consequence of the world's pariahism; and his interest in righteousness,which is not nearly so prominent among the Germans, the mere consequence of theunrighteousness of that pariahism.There is (or, until very recently, was) no Jewish nationTwo New Boys in the Neighborhoodto suffer pressure and put consequent pressure on both its members and theoutside world. It is the individual Jew who is both object and subject of thepressures which, in Germany's case, are sustained and exerted by the nation.Germany's internal Diaspora, the first Thirty Years' War, set the stage forGerman romanticism and German aggressiveness. The history of the combative,incurably restless German nation begins with the reduction of Germany to thedepths. The history of the individual Jew is parallel. But what the Germannation could seek by weight—its restoration, its \"place\"—the Jewish individualhad to seek by speed.The dispersed and scattered Jews—who were once much more fiercely tribal thanthe Germans—were compelled by their situation to become cosmopolitans. Thisforced cosmopolitanism of the isolated Jew has two polar consequences. Oppressedby each nation, the Jew must be the reformer of the nation, as Germany, isolatedand oppressed by the world, must be the reformer of the world. At the same timethe Jew must be the most adjustable of men. Except for his religion—which, inthe modern West, is weak—he has no continuing mold to contain and shape him. Hehas nothing to hold to, to fall back upon, to hide behind when war, revolution,famine, tyranny, and persecution sweep over him. He has nothing to turn to butGod.The German has Germany. The German individual, living his changeless generationsin his own land, among his own people, and on his own soil, has had no need foradjustability and has never developed it. What for the Jew is the centralproblem of life does not—I must say did not, for times are changing—exist forthe German.From the Castle hill in Kronenberg one can still see the country German in thesecond half of the twentieth cen-tury—the thousand-skirted costumes (the Protestant and Catholic aprons tieddifferently), the oxen (and often the women and the children) pulling aperforated cheese cask on wheels through the fields for irrigation. The firstWorld War shook the little valleys; on the walls of a village church one countsa hundred memorial wreaths from the first World War, in a village of a thousandpopulation. The peasant youth began to move to the towns. The second World Warblew the town and city people out of their houses and packed the railroad trainsand the roads.After 1918 the immobile German, incapable of adjusting to the new conditionsinflicted upon him, turning romantically and meaninglessly toward the hope ofrestoring the old, found himself bewildered and increasingly helpless, while theJew was in the element in which, through no fault (or virtue) of his own, hethrives best: changing conditions, requiring rapid and radical adjustment.Instead of saying that the Jews were the \"decomposing element\" in ImperialRome—a favorite citation of the Nazis— Mommsen should have said that the Jew wasable, because he had to be, to adjust himself to a decomposing, as to any otherkind, of Rome.Between 1918 and 1933 this marginal man, the Jew, this Luftmensch, this man inthe air, in a situation which put a premium on speed and a penalty on weight,rose to such power in a decomposing Germany that his achievement lookeddangerously like that of a superman. But wasn't the German to be thesuperman?—Very well, then. The order in which the Jew was usurping this rolewould have to be reversed, the standards of supermanliness redefined to fit theGerman. Superman, the German, would not adjust to this world; he would adjustit. So—oder so.The pliant German, beaten into shape by centuries ofTwo New Boys in the Neighborhoodnonresistance, could not compete with the subtle Jew. Germany, the marginalnation, had always had to struggle to survive—but not the German. The German hadonly to do as he was told, while to do as he was told would have been fatal tothe Jew. The Jew had to take chances, and so did the German nation. But theGerman individual, unless he was crazy drunk, could not take chances. The Jewdid not drink; he had to be light to live. The German nation had to drink tolighten itself, and what do nations drink but blood?In Germany or in England or in Russia, everywhere, indeed, except in the lostHomeland, the Jew had to be light as a feather and fast as the wind. LikeGermany-—but not like the German—he was hemmed in by hostile neighbors. He hadto fight—honorably, if possible, dishonorably, if necessary, like the Germannation. He was driven, like the German nation, to every extreme and every excessof good and evil, and his situation evoked in him whatever geniuses survivalrequired of him. Moses Mendelssohn and the Jewish pander were both Jews, just asthe Germany of Schiller and that of Streicher were both Germany. Germany is theJew among nations.\"They are always insisting on something,\" the hostess of one of the presentlydecrepit but eternally fashionable resort hotels on Lago Maggiore said. She wasspeaking of the Germans collectively. \"One can't say just what it is that theyseem to be insisting on. But they are uncomfortable, and they must make themanagement and the rest of the guests uncomfortable. Just like the Jews.\"\"What?\" I said, collectively insulted. She laughed. \"Not every Jew,\" she said,\"and, of course, not every German; only enough of them to make one think,always, 'the Germans/ Perhaps I am prejudiced. I am half-German myself.\"Being beset, in fancy and in reality, has produced in the Jews and in the Germannation the compensatory assertion of superiority and messianism. Each of themmust save the world; so only, saving the world, are Germany and the Jew to besaved. But neither is evangelistic. Conversion (which implies humility) and love(which implies submission) have no place in cither's mission. The remainingalternative is mastery; mastery, of course, for the sake of the mastered. In theGermans the necessary means of mastery, imposed upon the benefactors by theintransigence of the prospective beneficiaries, were lately seen to be genocide.But genocide was not unknown, once, to the Jews, and, if survival requiresexcessive measures, the salvation of the whole world ennobles their use.To other, less hard-pressed, peoples, the prejudice of the Jew againstintermarriage is unintelligible. Among Westerners, only the Nazis share thisprejudice. Doctrinal restrictions are not involved, as they are amongChristians, where the prohibition against marriage is dissolved by conversion.To the Nazi the Jew is forever a Jew; to the Jew the non-Jew is always anon-Jew. In both cases the inference of taint is inescapable. And in neither theNazi (who is nothing but the German stripped of religion) nor the Jew is thereany confidence that the threatened taint might be diluted or dissipated; inboth, the overriding concern is purity. That this arrogation of purity is animpudence other peoples than the Germans and the Jew will agree. But otherpeoples live in a different world from the Jew and the Germans. These two livein a world of their own.The German Jew was the perfect German. The Jewish Encyclopaedia has, I suppose,fifty times as many citations of German specialists as of all the Jews all overthe rest of the world together. Was there ever a \"better\" GermanTwo New Boys in the Neighborhoodthan Bismarck's adviser, the Jew Bleichroder, or than Wil-helm IFs, the JewBallin? And who but the Jew Stahl laid the constitutional foundations for whatwe call \"Prus-sianism\" in Germany? It is the German Jew who, in a minority, willsoon or late dominate Israel; already we hear, in Israel, of what we think of aspeculiarly German forms of extremist tendency, the same tendency toward \"Nazi\"behavior observed among the Jewish prisoners in Buchenwald by Professor BrunoBettelheim.And how this German Jew loved his Germany, for which he was willing to give uphis Judaism! How German he seemed to be abroad, so much so that everywhere inthe Allied countries in the first World War the Jew was suspected of beingpro-German! What happened to him from 1933 on he could not believe; he stayedon, until 1936, until 1938, until 1942, until-. \"It won't last,\" he toldhimself. What made him think it wouldn't? Why, this was Germany, his Germany.And now, in England and America, in France and Brazil and Mexico, there is a newkind of Jew, the Jew who has learned, when he speaks of those who a few yearsago were his countrymen in his beloved country, to say \"the Germans/' todistinguish them, just as Hitler did, from the Jews.The \"Lorelei,\" the song of the witch of the Rhine who dazzles and wrecks theboatman, is the German people's most popular song, not today, or yesterday, butalways; so popular that the Nazis did not dare eliminate it from the songbooks.Instead, they included it with the wonderful line, Dichter unbeJbnnt, \"Authorunknown.\" Every German knew that the author of the most German of all Germanfolksongs was Heinrich Heine. It took Heine, the German Jew, to write in exile:Der Eichenbaum wuchs dort so hoch, die Veilchenm'ckten sanft. Es war ein TraumDas Jciisste mich auf deutsch und sprach auf deutsch (Man glaubt es kaum,Wie gut es Hang) das Wort, \"Ich liebe dichl\" Es war ein Traum.It is untranslatably beautiful:Once I had a Fatherland.The oak grew there so great, the violet so small andsweet.It was a dreamThat kissed me in German and in German spoke (If only you knew how good itsounded in German!) The words, \"I love you/' It was a dream.It took Heinrich Heine, the Jewish German, to write: \"Better to die than tolive, best of all never to have lived.\" With the world—and themselves?—againstthem both, both Germany and the Jew appear to be indestructible. The Nazis'\"final solution\" of \"the Jewish question\" was the destruction of the Jews, asthe world's \"final solution\" of \"the German question,\" advanced by theMorgenthau-ites, was the destruction of Germany. We may assume that theMorgenthauite program to reduce Germany to a primitive peasant nation was nomore final than the Nazis' program to .reduce the Jews of Germany to primitivepeasant persons, \"working on the land.\" What the world was too civilized to do(or to attempt to do), the Nazis were not. But the Nazis no more succeeded inreducing the status of the Jews than the world succeeded in reducing the status271Two New Boys in the Neighborhoodof Germany. German recovery, a few years after the lost war in 1945, was thewonder of the world. And the twenty thousand Jews left in Germany were on theirway to greater distinction, in both the highest and lowest endeavors, than everbefore.The survival of Germany is much more easily explained, historically andanthropologically, than the survival of the Jew, two thousand years from hisFatherland and scattered into dozens of hostile environments. He has survived.Perhaps he has survived so that the survival of Germany, and of the Germany wehave lately known, might bear witness to the world that there is more in theworld than meets the eye. It may be that the explanation of survival is notexhausted by historical and anthropological analysis or by social-psychologicalcurve-making; it may be that Cain's answer to the Lord is relevant, too,As the fate of the Jews—and of Germany—approached its climax in the last monthsof the second World War, the Judisches Nachrichtenblatt, published weekly by theGerman Jews at the order of the Nazi Government, to communicate \"directives\" tothose of Nazism's victims who were left alive, shrank in size and content and,finally, in frequency of publication. It shrank, too, in the quality of paperallotted to it, and it is for that reason that I wish to publish, in itsoriginal form, on paper which will outlast the March 5, 1943, issue of theNachrichtenblatt, a story which appeared in the lower right-hand corner, on thereverse side of the single sheet, manuscript-paper size, which constituted thepublication:Alles zum GutenJmmer gewohne sich der Mensch zu denlcen; \"Was Gott schicJct ist gut; es diinkemir gut oder bose.\"Ein frommer Weiser Icam vor eine Stadt, deren Tore geschlossen waren. Niemandwollte sie ihm offnen; hungrig und durstig musste er unterm freiem Himmeliibernachten. Er sprach: \"Was Gott schickt, ist gut/' und legte sich nieder.Neben ihm stand ein Esel, zu seiner Seite eine brennende Laterne um derUnsicherheit willen in derselben Gegend. Aber ein Sturm entstand und loschtesein Licht aus, ein Lowe kam und zerriss seinen Esel, Er erwachte, fand sichallein und sprach: \"Was Gott schickt ist gut/' Er erwartete ruhig dieMorgenrote.Als er ans Tor Icam, fand er die Tore offen, die Stadt verwiistet ? beraupt undgepliindert. Ein Schar Rauber war eingefallen und hatte eben in dieser Nacht dieEinwohner gefangen weggefiihrt oder getotet. Er war verschont. \"Sagte ichnicht/' sprach er ? \"dass alles, was Gott schickt, gut sei? NUT sehen wirmeistens am Morgen erst ? warum er uns etwas des Abends versagte.\"(Aus dem Talmud). In English:EVERYTHING HAPPENS FOR THE BESTWe know that whatever God sends us, however good or bad it may seem to us, isgood.A pious man came to a city whose gates were closed. No one would open them tolet him in. Hungry and thirsty, he had to spend the night outside the gates.Still he said, \"Whatever God sends us is good/' and he lay down to sleep.Beside him stood his ass, and his lantern burned to ward off the dangers of thedark. But a storm came up and extinguished the lantern. Then a lion came up and,as the pious man slept, tore the ass to pieces. Awakening, and seeing hisTwo New Boys in the Neighborhoodplight, the pious man • said, \"Whatever God sends us is good/' and serenelyawaited the sunrise.Day broke. The pious man found the gates open, the city laid waste andplundered. A band of robbers had fallen upon the city during the night and hadmurdered some of the citizens and enslaved the rest. The pious man had beensaved. \"Didn't I say/ 7 he said to himself, \"that whatever God sends us is good?We must wait until morning, and then we will understand the meaning of thenight/'(From the Talmud).CHAPTER 23\"Like God in Fiance\"Substances move, under pressure, to extreme positions and, when they shiftpositions, shift from one extreme to the other. Men under pressure are drainedof their shadings of spirit, of their sympathy (which they can no more give thanget), of their serenity, their sweetness, their simplicity, and their subtlety.Their reactions are structuralized; like rubber balls (which we say have \"life\"in them because they react in such lively fashion to the living impulse outsidethem), the harder they are bounced, the higher they go. Such men, when they aretold not to cut down a tree, won't cut down a tree, but when they are not toldnot to cut down a man, they may cut down a man.The German who is dedicated to instant self-immolation for the sake of Germanyis the same German whose day-today egotism amazes the world. This egotism,always \"idealized\" (that is, romanticized), is, as has often been observed, thevery heart of German philosophy; but it is also the basis of the habitualcallousness of ordinary life. It is as if there were, in the human heart, onlyso much selflessness; pressure requires so much of it of the Germans that theyare left with almost none for volition.I know that the unconcern for others displayed, say, by the American who plays ahotel-room radio late at night, is everywhere common in an individualisticcivilization except, perhaps, among the English; but nowhere, not even\"Like God in France\"among the English, are \"manners\" as rigidly emphasized as they are among theGermans, and nowhere as among these people who swarm to tribal sacrifice have Iseen men so invariably fail to offer old women their seats in busses,streetcars, or trains. Nowhere have I seen so many old men and women staggeringthrough train sheds with heavy suitcases and never an offer of assistance fromthe empty-handed, nowhere such uniform disinclination to assist on the scene ofan accident or to intervene between children fighting on the street. But theservice in German hotels, restaurants, and stores is superb. One \"minds one'sown business\" in the small affairs of the street, in the larger affairs of thejob or the family, in the great affairs of the State.Grimly preoccupied with themselves; deadly serious and deadly dull (only theGermans could have been unbored by Hitler); tense, hurried, unrelaxed;purpose-bedeviled, always driven somewhere to do something; taking the siestalike Communion, with determined, urgent intent; sneering, and not alwaysgenteelly, at the Frenchman sitting \"doing nothing\" at his cafe (wie Gott inFranfcreich, \"like God in France/' is the German expression for \"carefree\"), atthe Italian talking his head off over his endless dinner; incapable of quietwithout melancholy or frustrated fury; insatiably hungry for the heights or thedepths, stone sober or roaring drunk; forever insisting that man is born tosuffer —and then begrudging the suffering; unresponsive and over-reactive;stodgy and unstable; uncalm, the inventors and prime practitioners of \"stomachtrouble\"; tormented, exhausted, unable to remain fully awake unless they areangry or hilarious—these, with more than a little hyperbole, with millions ofexceptions and contradictions and still more millions of variations, are theways and the woes of men under pressure.Men under pressure are first dehumanized and only then demoralized, not theother way around. Organization and specialization, system, subsystem, andsupersystem are the consequence, not the cause, of the totalitarian spirit.National Socialism did not make men unfree; unfreedom made men NationalSocialists.Freedom is nothing but the habit of choice. Now choice is remarkably wide inthis life. Each day begins with the choice of tying one's left or right shoelacefirst, and ends with the choice of observing or ignoring the providence of God.Pressure narrows choice forcibly. Under light pressure men sacrifice smallchoices lightly. But it is only under the greatest pressure that they sacrificethe greatest choices, because choice, and choice alone, informs them that theyare men and not machines.The ultimate factor in choosing is common sense, and it is common sense that menunder pressure lose fastest, cut off as they are (in besieged \"Peoria\") from thecommon condition. The harder they are pressed, the harder they reason; theharder they must reason. But they tend to become unreasonable men; forreasonableness is reason in the world, and \"Peoria\" is out of this world.The besieged intellect operates furiously; the general intelligence atrophies.Theories are evolved of the grandest order and the greatest complexity,requiring only the acceptance of the nonworlds, the Ideas, in which they arise.The two extremist doctrines that have seized hold of our time—Marx's, denyingthat there is anything in man, and Freud's, denying that there is anythingoutside—are Made in Germany. If you will only accept Marx's \"human nature has noreality\" or Freud's \"conscience is nothing but the dread of the community/' youwill find them both irresistibly scientific.\"Like God in France\"In such exquisitely fabricated towers a man may live (or even a whole society),but he must not look over the edge or he will see that there is no foundation.The fabrication is magnificent; the German is matchless in little things,reckless only in big ones, in the fundamental, fateful matters which, in hispreoccupation, he has overlooked. That a Wagner should be a vulgar anti-Semite(or stand on his head, or wear a ring in his nose, or whatever) is one thing; hewas \"only a genius/' But that one of Germany's two greatest historians,Treitschke, should be a ravening chauvinist, that the other, Mommsen, shouldfind in Julius Caesar \"the complete and perfect man\"—these are something else.Max Weber could be \"the father of sociology,\" but he could not see what wassociologically unhealthy in the institution of student dueling.Who is this Einstein, who was \"only a scientist\" when he conceived the atomicbomb and now, in his old age, sees what he has done and weeps? He is the Germanspecialist, who had always \"minded his\"—high—\"business\" and was no more proofagainst romanticism than his tailor, who had always minded his low business. Heis the finished product of pressure, the uneducated expert, like the postalclerk in Kronenberg whose method of moistening stamps on the back of his hand isinfallible. The German mind, encircled and, under pressure of encirclement,stratified, devours itself in the production of lifeless theories of man andsociety, deathless methods of licking postage stamps, and murderous machinery.For the rest—which is living— the German has to depend upon his ideals.CHAPTE R 24But a Man Must Believe in SomethingIt is the Germans' ideals which are dangerous; their practices, when theirideals do not have hold of them, are not a bit better or worse than other men's.Where do they get their ideals? 'The 'passions/ \" says Santayana, \"is the oldand fit name for what the Germans call ideals/' This idealist slave of his ownor another man's passions was twice sundered from Rome, in A.D. 9 and in A.D.1555. In the year 9 the Germans expelled the founders of secular Europe; in 1555they cut themselves loose from the Weltanschauung which the age of theMediterranean fused in Italy from the Greco-Hebraic break with Syria and EgyptThis bright Weltanschauung rests upon the dogma of personal responsibility. Thisdogma is the first fact of our civilization. Its repulse left Germany peculiarlyrootless.Thought, like feeling, took root in irresponsibility, with subjectivism,relativism, \"intelligent skepticism\" its flower. It was not only in physics orin government that the Germans excelled in producing Frankenstein's monsters butin epistemology itself. Thought is all, but there are a thousand ways ofthinking. The thinker can attach no worth to his thinking as against anotherman's because there is no reality to measure them both, only internalconsistency, \"system/' At the same time no other man's system is, by definition,better than his. The superiority of the thinking lies—somewhere—in the thinker.But a Man Must Believe in Something\"A trite, nauseatingly repulsive, ignorant charlatan without esprit, who withunexampled impertinence scribbled together twaddle and nonsense, which his venaladherents trumpeted forth ... the hollowest farrago of words devoid of sensethat ever satisfied dunderheads . . . repulsive . . . recalls the ravings ofmadmen/' This is a philosophical critique by one of Germany's greatestphilosophers, Schopenhauer, of another of Germany's greatest philosophers,Hegel. The \"pedantic arrogance\" of which Goethe complained in the Germans wasthe self-assuredness not of common, Western dogma but of the antidogmatic who,needing, like all men, dogma to live by, had none to fall back on but his own.Each man was his own \"school\"; you did not go to Germany to get an education butto get a man or, more exactly, a mind. The characteristic German professor didnot know the students or meet them (and there were no student deans oradvisers). He was a thinker, and a teacher of thinking.Cut from its moorings in Western dogma, German thinking shot up unencumbered tothe clouds. Balloons ascended everywhere. Which basket the fortunate few boardedwas a matter of fancy and favoritism; once they were off the ground, they wereall equally impervious to puncture by reality down below. \"He stands up there,\"said Willy Hof-meister, the old policeman; \"I stand down here. I can't arguewith him. I'm not stupid, but he's spent his whole life studying. He knows. Idon't\" He was contrasting wir Einfachen, we simple people, with die Gebildeten,the cultivated.Down below were wir Einfachen, the millions who were some day to be Nazis, the\"little men\" who, as Balzac put it, seemed to have been sent into the world toswell the crowd. When I was first in Germany I asked a German theologianto help me find one such \"little man/' one whom National Socialism hadconfronted with innerlicher Konflilct, moral struggle. The theologian replied:\"Moral struggle?—They had none. They are all little sausages, Wiirstchen.\"German thought soared away from the Wiirstchen, carrying with it the elect forwhom the educational system above the eighth grade existed, and the stage andthe philharmonic and the bookstores. For the rest—let the greatest of the greatGerman masters say it:He who has Science has Art,Religion, too, has he; Who has not Science, has not Art,Let him religious be.For the rest, there were the churches and the songs of Heaven and Home. At theKronenberg Singfest, held in the auditorium of Kronenberg University at Easter,I saw not one of my academic colleagues. But eight of my ten \"little men\" werethere.To the extent that the big men influenced the little men, it was to convincethem that thought, of which they themselves were incapable, was everything.There is, besides intelligent skepticism, unintelligent skepticism, and it was along time ago that Nietzsche asserted that Germans as a whole were skeptics. Theground fell away from under the churches even while, in the gradually emptyingsanctuary, those who were still credulous were promised the invincibility ofGerman arms. When German arms proved vincible, the churches lost still more ofthe credulous.But people who do not have a good religion will have a bad one. They will have areligion; they will have something to believe in. Men—not just Germans—cannotbear the pressure of life, however light it may be elsewhere com-But a Man Must Believe in Somethingpared with the pressure upon the Germans. Hitlerism was a mass flight to dogma,to the barbaric dogma that had not been expelled with the Romans, the dogma ofthe tribe, the dogma that gave every man importance only in so far as the tribewas important and he was a member of the tribe. My ten Nazi friends—and a greatmajority of the rest of the seventy million Germans—swarmed to it. Germanthought had not bothered to take them along on its flight. It had left them onthe ground. Now they are back on the ground again, rooting around the husks ofold ideals for a kernel.The Germans were, when Hitler found them, emotionally undernourished. Life in abesieged city, even relaxation, is unrelievedly rigid. Happiness is dismissed asunattainable —the German word for it is derived from Gliick, luck—and itspursuit then disdained as decadent. But it is duty-bearers, notpleasure-seekers, who go berserk. The ordinary hours of the German person, dayby day, do not feed his hunger for expression. The decline of conversation is avery modern phenomenon, and a world phenomenon wherever the most modern means ofmass communication have replaced it; but the malady of repression is somethingelse. Repression is not the same thing as reserve, any more than denial (theGermans are peerless here) is the same as self-denial.In a stifled, lid-on atmosphere, the \"German\" way of thinking flourished,exoteric, meticulous, and introverted; flourished in the starved soil of Germanemotion. National Socialism fructified that soil, and it bloomed suddenly redwith fire and blood.CHAPTER 25Push-Button PanicOne Saturday afternoon in Kronenberg three house-painters, who were off at noon,got hold of some Weinbrand at our house, and, when we returned from a visit, wefound the house torn up and the painters howling drunk. Tante Kathe, ourfive-foot-tall housekeeper, was with us. She handed them mops and brooms andsaid, \"Clean up and get out/' In instant, silent sobriety they cleaned up andgot out. They were back Monday morning for work, without a word of apology, ablush of shame, or a man-to-man wink.The speed of the German is the initial speed of release under pressure, soonspent. Then the pressure reasserts itself, and the German re-emerges as he is:sober, a heavy, heavy man. His personality, under pressure, is just asexcessively submissive as it is assertive. Its essence is excess. On November 9,1938, word went through the country that the synagogues were to be burned. Amillion men, released like jack-in-the-boxes, sprang to action. Pushed back inthe boxes, as they were by Goring's order the following morning, a million mendropped their fagots; another sixty-nine million, who had not thought much aboutit the night before, reproached the million in silence; and the work of arson,robbery, enslavement, torture, and murder proceeded in legalized form, in Zuchtimd Ordnung.Zucht und Ordnung, discipline and order. My two friends Hofmeister and Schwenke,the policeman and thePush-Button Panictailor, who hated one another and who represented two incompatible moralities,agreed that \"it doesn't matter whether you call it a democracy or dictatorshipor what, as long as you have discipline and order.\" The sensitive cabinetmaker,Klingelhofer, and the insensitive bill-collector, Simon, said the same thing.Neither morality nor religion but legality is decisive in a state of perpetualsiege. And the attest of legality is order; law and order are not two things butone.The gas ovens of Belsen were peculiarly German; the improvised slaughter pits ofthe Ukraine were Nazi. The distinction is a large one. Nazism, like the LutheranReformation and all other German upheavals, contained revolutionary elements ofimprovisation. But Nazism was always at war with the Army. The Army was German.The remarkable fact of the Putsch against Hitler of July 20, 1944, is that ahandful of Army officers could be found to undertake it; that it was planned sorecklessly; that it happened at all, not that it failed or might have succeeded.It was treated as treason. What it was was un-German.What was truly German was what has come to be called the cold pogrom, thesystematic persecution, legal, methodical, and precisely co-ordinated, of the\"national enemies.\" When you have combined \"cold\" with \"pogrom\"—they appear tobe uncombinable—you have Nazi Germany, the organism as a whole gone wild, itsorgans admirably co-ordinated. The universal witness of the people invaded bythe Germans is the nonhumanity of the conqueror, his pushbutton transition fromfury to formality, from fire to ice and back again, depending on whether he isunder orders or out from under orders. A Nazi might be moved by a prisoner'splea that he had a wife and children; but a German would say, \"So have I.\"The German's incapacity for calm, consistent insubordination—for being first andlast a free man—is the key to his national history. Germany has often had acounterrevolution, but never a revolution. What the Germans would call arevolution the Americans would call a Putsch. 'The German revolutionaries/' saidLenin, \"could not seize the railways because they did not have aBahnsteigfearte\"—the ten-pfennig ticket admitting visitors to the train shed.The Reformation and the Counter Reformation were both counterreformations.(Luther's \"peasant\" uprising ended with Luther's tract Against the Murderous andRapacious Hordes of the Peasants.) The German War of Liberation against Napoleonsaddled Germany with peacetime conscription, and the revolutionary unificationof the Reich in 1871 was achieved by the reactionary Junker of Prussia.The German breakout—call it liberation, call it aggression, call it what youwill—is a kind of periodic paranoid panic. In between times, the pressure fromoutside having supervened, and having been passed on from Germany to theGermans, the next panic cooks silently, symptomlessly, in Zucht und Ordnung. Toblame Germany—still less the Germans—is to blame the thistle for its fruit. Itis fantastic to suppose that, with the pressures of destruction, defeat,partition, foreign rule, and cold war superimposed upon those that alreadyexisted, \"it\" will not happen again. It not only will happen; it must, unlessthe life of seventy million Germans is altered at the very depth and they find away to live wie Gott in Frankreich, \"like God in France.\"PART IIITheir Cause and CureThe TrialNovember 9, 1948:\"HEAR, YE TOWNSFOLK, HONEST MEN\"It is ten o'clock in the morning in Kronenberg, and, in the Courthouse justbelow the Castle, the three members of theth District Court of Hesse have ascended the bench topronounce judgment. Except for the defendants and their counsel and a few closerelatives of some of the defendants, the courtroom is almost empty, for the factis that there is not much interest in the pending case in Kronenberg.Kronenberg is a quiet town. Jt is one of the quiet old \"picture-book towns/' ofwhich there are (or were) so very many in Germany. Most of them are partlydestroyed now, some of them wholly. But old Kronenberg is (as it always has beenin the wars) but lightly scarred. And, like all lightly scarred towns now,Kronenberg's prewar population is almost doubled, and around the railroadstation and along the lowland of the Werne there are shacks and hovels which arenot seen in picture-books.Kronenberg must be excused for not keeping up its picture-book appearance. Yousee, there are no tourists now. (Who would come to Germany?) And theKronenbergers— even those who had savings have just been wiped out by thecurrency stabilization—are preoccupied with staying alive. The town is shabby,very shabby, and the weeds are head-The Trialhigh in the lot where the synagogue stood, and the iron fence, which stillsurrounds the lot, is rusted.But the ruins of the war are few in Kronenberg. Two or three times sorties ofplanes crisscrossed the town in the night and burned a dozen houses down andfired into the streets; that was all, in quiet little old nonindustrialKronen-berg, except for the day that the bombers, apparently aiming at therailroad station, set fire to the University Eye Clinic a mile away from thestation and burned up fifty-three blindfolded patients.Still, one doesn't measure the damage entirely in ruins; one measures it, too,in years of air-raid alarms, night after night; in the price of unpasteurizedmilk; in the bundle of kindling that costs a day's work to buy and is gone in anhour. The Kronenbergers are tired people, too tired to climb the Castle hill tothe Courthouse to hear all about it all over again.The three judges sit silent until the Katherine bell, the Parish bell, and theTown Hall rooster have given their dissynchronous notice that it is ten o'clock;then the senior judge, having first exchanged nods with his colleagues to hisright and left, begins to read the decision;\"This is the first case arising from the synagogue arson of November 9,1938, tobe decided under the full jurisdiction of the German Courts. The previous caseswere adjudicated in de-Nazification proceedings under the United States HighCommand for the Occupation of Germany. . ..\"Every defendant in this case, as in all preceding cases, has argued that he wasacting under superior orders. The doctrine was asserted by the InternationalMilitary Tribunal at Nuremberg that superior orders do not constitute a defenseof a crime against humanity. This doctrine is not clear to this court. Citizensmust obey the law and the officers ofthe law, or anarchy will rule. And yet, no man should commit an offense againsthumanity. Here we have an apparent contradiction.\"But in the instant case, the truth of the charges does not requireclarification of this doctrine or resolution of the apparent contradiction. Wemay, therefore, proceed to a finding.\"In this case we do not know who gave the original orders or whether originalorders were given. We know that in one night, November 9, 1938, five hundred andeighty-six synagogues were destroyed in Germany, and the Court takes judicialnotice of this fact which led to the disgrace of the German nation and a tragicmisunderstanding of the German character everywhere in the world.\"In the instant case, there is testimony, which the Court does not exclude, thatthe synagogue was on fire many minutes, or even hours, before any of thedefendants in this or in previous cases approached the scene of the crime. Itseems likely that this was true and unlikely now that any more of the offenderswill ever be identified. Official and unofficial records of all kinds whichmight have been relevant appear for the most part to have been destroyed before,during, or at the end of the war.\"But the charges here, of breach of the peace by a public mob and of criminalarson, do not require us to answer the many questions which will probably remainunanswered to the end of time. Under the statutes, participation is culpable,and, if the Court may revert to the claim of superior orders, it may be saidthat evidence of willingness, or even of eagerness, to carry out such orders hasbeen considered. Such willingness and eagerness have, in some instances, beenfound. . ..\"In the days preceding the crime, it had to be expected,The Trialand was in general expected, that in case of the death of the wounded DiplomaticCounselor vom Rath in Paris, there would be violent measures taken against theJews. The widely prevailing, artificially fostered tension pressed for release.Against the threatening danger stood such institutions for the usualpreservation of public order as, for example, the police, who were themselveseither anti-Semitically inclined or stood aside inactive.\"It has been established that there were no police at the scene of the crime;why, we do not know judicially. Under these circumstances it was to be expectedthat a group of persons, even of two men, would run into no resistance worthmentioning, especially when these persons were garbed in the SA uniform. Thesmallest group could pose a threat to public peace. They could reckon with thefact that their measures were approved in the highest official places, and theinstitutions responsible for the preservation of public order would notunsheathe their weapons.\"In assigning the punishment, the Court has considered, as favorable toleniency, the fact that the defendants have never been convicted of any crimeexcept those arising from their political activity. They did not belong to the'criminal class/ They had been good citizens and, as far as the record is beforeus, honorable men. Political passion made criminals of them. As members of theParty and of the SA they were overcome by year-in-year-out propaganda. Theireducational level is not high, although all of them are fully literate and allof them had religious training in school in their childhood. This is said herebecause they seemed to take no responsible position as individuals toward theproblem of respect for human beings who believed other than they did.\"The crime was committed at a time when the leadership of the State would notpunish such assaults against unpopu-lar persons or groups or their property and in this sense favored and even urgedsuch assault. In addition, many of the highest officials of the State competedwith one another, in the interest of their own political popularity, in the mostviolent denunciations of such persons or groups, thus arousing the passions ofordinary citizens who look to their public officials for counsel and direction,\"Certain facts, however, argue against leniency in the instant case. . . .\"Nearly all the defendants in all the cases arising from this criminal act havedenounced one another (and accused one another of denouncing them in order toexculpate themselves or gain an advantage). This has not been a spectacle ofwhich Germans may be proud. And it has had the effect on this Court and,apparently, on others, of destroying the weight of all denunciations andcounterdenunciations.\"In addition, nearly all the defendants, caught in multifariousself-contradictions, have said that they cannot remember what they said inearlier proceedings, or that the events at issue occurred too long ago for themto be sure of anything, or that too many things more important in their liveshave happened since. The witness Karl-Heinz Schwen-ke, former SA Sturmf iihrer,brought here from prison, where he is serving a three-year sentence for his partin the arson, has made a particularly unhappy spectacle of himself in thisrespect. His claim that he is an old man and cannot remember clearly would, ifit were taken seriously, invalidate his repeated assertion that he should beregarded as a man of honor because he is a Christian and has applied forreadmis-sion into the Evangelical Church, which he left during NationalSocialism. If, at sixty-eight and, apparently, in good health, he is too old totake responsibility for his past acts, he may be equally too old to know what aChristian is. . . .The Trial\"It is true that, in the fortunes of politics and war subsequent to November 9,1938, aU the defendants in this and the other cases arising from this criminalarson have suffered loss of property, liberty, or health, or all three. But sohave those of their fellow-citizens who committed no crime, including those ofJewish ancestry or faith. If this Court could turn history back, it would, andso, undoubtedly, would the defendants; but it cannot and they cannot.\"Still, the punishment of these defendants will not restore the property rightsthat were lost, the human rights that were lost, the lives that were afterwardlost, and the abandonment by many of our people, including the defendants, oftheir honor and humanity, which led to the loss of these other values and shamedour German nation and our German civilization. . . .\"Since the principal perpetrator (in so far as we have evidence), the formerSturmftihrer Schwenke, was sentenced to three years upon conviction of thiscrime, the present defendants, whose roles were subsidiary to his, shouldreceive lesser sentences. The Court therefore. . ..\"CHAPTER 26The Broien StonesOne sunny spring afternoon our seven-year-old, Dicken, was playing in the alleyoutside our house in Kronenberg when a flight of four American jet planes camescreaming over the town, circled it, and went away. They were the first planesof any sort we had seen or heard over Kronenberg and the first jets we had seenor heard anywhere. Everyone ran to the window. Down below we saw Dicken'splaymates, six-, seven-, eight-year-olds, transfixed, like him, with wonder. Butthere were bigger children, too, ten or eleven and older, playing in the alley,and they, the bigger ones, ran away howling with terror, their hands clasped ontop of their heads. \"Didja see the jets?\" said Dicken, when he came in. We said\"Yes,\" and Dicken said, \"Why did the big boys and girls run away?\"War, between 1939 and 1945, had come at last to the country of the \"war men,\"the Germans. And from 1943 on, after Hermann Goring (who had said in 1941, \"If asingle bomb drops on Germany, my name is Hermann Meyer\") had become HermannMeyer, war came into the \"war men's\" houses to live with them, to eat with them,to sleep in their beds, and to take over the teaching of their children, thecare of their sick, and the burial of their living. On May 9, 1945, Germany wasa world of broken stones.On May 9, 1945, there were no more Nazis, non-Nazis,The Broken Stonesanti-Nazis. There were only people, all of them certainly guilty of something,all of them certainly innocent of something, coming out from under the brokenstones of the real Thousand-Year Reich—the Reich that had taken a thousandyears, stone by stone, to build.Those stones were the houses—not the munitions plants or the switchyards, butthe houses. In the city of Worms, the railroad roundhouse stood miraculouslyuntouched; and a half-mile away stood a whole row of walls that were onceapartment houses; and so it was in Frankfurt, where the I.G. Hochhaus, theheadquarters of the world dye trust, was undamaged; and in Berlin, where thePatent Office was intact. And so it was everywhere in Germany, for the war was awar against houses. One raid knocked one-third of Freiburg over; Dresden wasdestroyed in twenty-four hours. And Hamburg! And Munich! And Rotterdam! Warsaw!Coventry! Stalingrad! How could Americans understand? They couldn't.Americans, one-fifth of whom change their abode every year; Americans, buildinga brand-new America every fifty years; Americans visiting Antietam battlefield,Gettysburg battlefield, Bull Run battlefield—how could they understand the worldof broken stones that once were houses? Houses mean people. The war againsthouses was a war against people. \"Strategic bombing\" was one of war's littlejokes; the strategy was to hit railroads and power plants and factories—andhouses. Right up until the total collapse of steel fabrication at the end of1944, the Germans had four rails in the yards for every rail in use; within twoto six hours after a yard was hit, it was moving again. But sleepless workersweren't moving so fast, and terrified workers were moving still slower, andworkers whose homes were gone (and maybe a wife or child) weren't moving fast atallAmericans, visiting their Civil War battlefields, wouldn't know that it isn't aman's life and his work that yields the bomb its big dividend but hisaccumulated reason for living and working. In the first case, he's only a deadenemy. In the second, he's a live ally. In the war that came—for the firsttime—to the \"war men\" of Germany, the parlor was the prime military installationand the pictures on the parlor wall the prime military objective. If the bombhits the factory worker's parlor, it can let the factory go. The way to win warsis to hit the pictures on the worker's, the miner's, the soldier's parlor wall.And a bombardier who lets go from a mile or two up, or even five, can hardlymiss over Berlin— or Kronenberg.Words are worthless, and pictures, each of them worth a thousand words, areworthless. Seeing is not believing. Only having been there, having been hit ornot hit running to or from it, and being bedeviled forever by what might havebeen done a half-hour before or a half-minute after is worth anything. A bookmight have been saved, or a pair of shoes, or a mother or a child. Or apassport. Or a child might have been saved if a pair of shoes had been let go,or a mother if a child had been let go.And words and phrases like \"hit,\" \"got it,\" \"kaput,\" \"knocked over,\" talk aboutprize fights or three-balls-for-a-dime at an amusement park. All that words cansay is that Stuttgart was \"hit\" or Bremen \"hit hard\" (or Coventry orStalingrad—or Seoul). It's like saying that Christ, in the course of hiscarpentering, got a nail through his hand. Better not say it at all.Those houses against which the war was waged were built —even the tenementhouses—of stone or Gargantuan timbers laced together and covered with a smooth,imperme-The Broken Stonesable stucco. There were, in Germany, no rural slums, no bulging, leaning, orcaving barns, no tar-paper or clapboard shanties, no abandoned homesites, rottenfences, great mountains of rusting automobiles, nothing left to oxidize and blowaway. Everything had been built to endure to the last generation. Maybe this wasthe last generation.CHAPTER 27The LiberatorsThe defeat of Germany and the Germans in 1945 was not intended to relieve thepressures which had made them what they were. And it didn't. On the contrary, toall the old pressures which produced totalitarianism and aggression, it added,necessarily, new ones—the guilt-finding and punitive processes; thedismemberment first of the country itself and then of its business and industry;reparation costs, indemnification costs, occupation costs—and the Occupation.If any occupation ever had a chance of succeeding, it should have been theAmerican (sometimes called the Allied) Occupation of western Germany. Asoccupations went, it was probably the most benign in history, in part becausethe fortunes of their history have nourished benignity in the American people,in part because the Occu-pyees turned out to have the same kinds of tastes andtalents, and even cousins, as the Occupiers. That the Occupation did fail—if itsobject was to do any better than Versailles—is now clear, I think, to anyone whodoes not define peace as order or democracy as balloting. It failed because itwas an occupation, and no occupation has a chance of succeeding.The day the American troops came to Kronenberg, a sergeant rode through the townin a jeep and designated homes which were strategically located for occupancy byThe Liberatorsthe troops responsible for maintaining security. One of the homes belonged to awoman with two babies; within a few hours her furniture was out on the street,along with her and her children. She addressed the corporal in charge of theeviction, explaining to him, in English, that she was not a Nazi but ananti-Nazi. His reply was not unfriendly. He said, 'Too bad, lady/'It was too bad, lady, but that's the way it was. It was an occupation; worseyet, a civilized occupation, which, as such, violated Machiavelli's inviolableinjunction either to liberate or exterminate a conquered people but under nocircumstances to irritate them by halfway measures. The halfway measures of theAmerican Occupation were halfway just, but they were halfway unjust, too. Howcould they, being civilized, have been otherwise?The American determination to do something about Nazism meant that something hadto be done about each of some twenty-five million Germans. It required theemployment of thousands of their countrymen, selected, necessarily, in greathaste by Americans who were themselves selected in great haste; and this meantthe wrong men all around. Long before the de-Nazification process came of itsown weight to an ignominious halt, it had become a bottomless swamp. In theabsence of records—anti-Nazi and Nazi files had both been destroyed as first theNazis and then the anti-Nazis swept through Germany—the defendants invariablyaccused their accusers. It was a field day for paying off old scores. Oathspiled up on every side until they reached the heavens to which they wereaddressed. In Kronenberg University, eight years after the war, there were stillpending one hundred and sixty libel suits filed by faculty members against oneanother.Of course the American Military Occupation was Dra-conian; men cannot be taught to hate and kill on Wednesday and to love andcherish on Thursday. But by 1948 those Americans who wanted to participate inthe punishment of the Germans had had enough blood to drink and had all gonehome. With the substitution of civilian for military control of occupiedGermany, things looked up. Unfortunately (and ironically), the advent ofcivilian control coincided with the outbreak of war—the cold war between theUnited States and the Soviet Union.The civilian High Commission for the Occupation of Germany began its work in theshadow of that new situation. United States Commissioner McCloy commutedtwenty-one of the twenty-eight remaining death sentences of Nazis and vigorouslypushed the program of \"reorienta-tion and re-education\" that had been laid out,in dreamy detail, in the post-1945 and pre-1948 world. But the brave new programwas doomed from the start. Between 1950, when the Korean War began, and 1952,when the dreamers disappeared from the American government, the program limpedalong, ever more lamely.In 1952 it ended, without notice. Local \"Resident Offices\" of the HighCommission reverted to their prior status of United States Army subposts; there-educators and reorient-ers, who had been coming and going at the Germans'expense, went German-American Youth Centers and German-American Women's Clubsclosed quietly; dedications of new hospitals and schools, with German\"counterpart\" funds and American oratory, stopped. The members of the \"UnitedStates Occupation Forces in Germany\" were informed by the United States thatthey were now members of the \"United States Defense Forces in Germany.\" Only theState Department propaganda establishments—the United States InformationCenters, or AmeriJca-Hauser—The Liberatorsremained to mark the spot where the German character was to have beentransformed.Between mid-1950 and mid-1954 the budget of the United States High Commissionand related agencies was reduced 75 per cent, and personnel was cut from 2,264Americans and 12,131 Germans to 780 Americans and 3,650 Germans. Even morespectacular was the reduction in the number of automobiles operated (usuallywith German chauffeurs) to serve the urgent needs of the re-educators, from1,545 in mid-1952 to 251 in mid-1954. The decline in civilian activity was morethan matched by the rapid-as-possible redevelopment of the American militaryestablishment in Germany. In the fall of 1954, although the remilitarization ofGermany was not yet legalized, Robert S. Allen reported in his Washington columnthat, in addition to all American forces and facilities in Germany, there werebeing built by the United States a $250,000,000 weapons stockpile and a$100,000,000 food stockpile for six German Army divisions.The failure of the American Occupation had little or nothing to do with Germanresistance to it Apart from their impotence and their hunger and theOccupation's absolute control, the Germans were ausgespielt, played out, for awhile at least. Nine of my ten Nazi friends were positive that they would neveragain join a political party, any party. Always credulous and submissive, theGermans had just had twelve years' intensive training in total credulity andtotal submissiveness; the Occupiers found them marvelously docile, evenunresentful, Germans to the manner born.They were actually indifferent to the general civil corruption—something unknowneven in the Third Reich—introduced by the American black market. It was not forthem, good Germans, to complain of the morals of their newrulers. They might grumble, in their poverty, at having to pay fifty cents for apackage of cigarettes while the rich who had come to democratize them paid adime, but by and by American cigarettes so saturated the black market that thegrumbling was inconsequential. The rich Americans got still richer, but the poorGermans got good coffee for half the legal German price; one way or another,every third German was a direct or indirect beneficiary of the black market. Ina few years they were hardened—these once pretentiously honest Burgers—tomonstrous financial scandals. The State Department's construction of\"Westchester-on-the-Rhine\" for American officials—including five $100,000 homesand one at $240,000—did not, in 1953, excite even the Opposition in theBundestag. Hadn't Germany's rulers always been kings?The failure of the Occupation could not, perhaps, have been averted in the verynature of the case. But it might have been mitigated. Its mitigation would haverequired the conquerors to do something they had never had to do in theirhistory. They would have had to stop doing what they were doing and askthemselves some questions, hard questions, like, What is the German character?How did it get that way? What is wrong with its being that way? What way wouldbe better, and what, if anything, could anybody do about it?CHAPTER 28The Re-educators Re-educatedFrom the beginning, the American Occupation was an operating model ofnondemocracy and a demonstration of high-pressure salesmanship. But where werethe buyers? None of my ten friends had ever taken advantage of the resources ofthe Kronenberg Amerika-Haus except Herr Hildebrandt, the only one of the ten whodidn't need to be won to democracy. Besides the children who attended the everrepeated free movies of the Grand Canyon and Niagara Falls, the Amerika-Hauspatrons were, in the main, pro-Americans from 'way back and students writingpapers on American subjects assigned them by their hurriedly Americanizedinstructors. Prior to the onslaught of McCarthyism in 1952, the Amerika-Hauserstill stocked American books of all sorts, all of them, unfortunately, inEnglish. They were no more read by my friends—or burned—than the anti-Nazi NewYork Times had been when it was available in the fashionable hotels of NaziBerlin.What the Germans needed was to see what democracy was, not to hear it touted.But in my year in Kronenberg there was not one controversial public discussionor debate under American sponsorship or control. In East Germany, a few milesaway, the Communists were beating the drum for Communism; in Kronenberg theAmericans were blowing the trumpet for Americanism; and in both places, not solong since, the Nazis had been burning the torch for Nazism. But the Germanshad—in their own polite phrase-had a noseful of beating, blowing, and burning.The Germans were, after 1945, in a position to begin to judge Nazism, whoseblessings and curses they had now experienced, if only they could begin to havethe experience of another way. But they would first have to see another way inoperation before their eyes and be attracted to its practice. They wouldcertainly fumble it at first—or second—but who hasn't? They might misunderstandit and even misuse it. But how else would they ever discover what it was? Whenmy little boy cuts the tail off the cat and I say, \"When will you learn how tobe a good boy?\" he replies, \"I already know—youVe told me a thousand milliontimes.\"Freedom is risky business; when I let my little boy cross the street alone forthe first time, I am letting him risk his life, but unless I do he will grow upunable to cross the street alone. For the American Occupation to have chosenfreedom for the post-Nazi Germans would have been dangerous; even my anti-Nazifriends, so thoroughly German were they, were opposed to freedom of speech,press, and assembly for the \"neo-Nazis.\" But it was the fear of freedom, withall its dangers, that got the Germans into trouble in the first place. When theAmericans decided that they could not \"afford\" freedom for the Germans, theywere deciding that Hitler was right.Free inquiry on a free platform is the only practice that distinguishes a freefrom a slave society; and, if the post-Nazi Germans needed force, they needed itfor the one purpose it had never been used for in Germany, namely, to keep theplatform free. What they needed was the town meeting, the cracker barrel—to see,to hear, and at last to join the war on the totalitarianism in their own hearts.The Re-educators Re-educatedWhat they needed was not the Grand Canyon or Niagara Falls but the Sundayafternoon forum in Bughouse Square and the thunderous cry of American authority:\"Let 'im talk, let'im talk.\"My friend Willy Hofmeister, the old policeman, was amazed, and kept adverting tohis amazement, that Mein Kampf had not been banned in America during the war.What the Germans needed, so sorely that without it no effort, no expenditure, noarmy would ever help them, was to learn how to talk and talk back, In theArnerika-Hauser and on all the other American-controlled platforms they heardlectures on Goethe's Debt to Edgar A. Guest and learned the old, old Germanlesson of listening to their betters tell them what was good and what was greatand what was good and great for them.What they needed, and went on needing during the whole of the AmericanOccupation, was the peculiarly American genius for contentious and continuoustalk in a framework not of law but of spirit. Everything else they needed theyhad genius enough, and more, to produce for themselves.Why should America have undertaken, in 1945, to export freedom, above all to apeople who had habitually squandered their own and eaten up other people's? Thequestion may or may not have had merit, but it was too late, in 1945, to ask it.The American Occupation had added something new to the history of occupations:idealism. It had undertaken to do something more than punish, collect, andcontrol: it had undertaken to civilize the Germans.The two tottering old civilizations of Europe, France and England, showed smallappetite for what they may have thought an impossible ambition, and they draggedtheir heels at every turn. But there were two new civilizations on?06the German scene, the United States and the Soviet Union. They, with theirconflicting views of civilization, were ardent with regard to their respectiveareas of control, and, if either of them had not wanted to be, the other's ardorwould have forced it.It was on the East-West border of divided Germany that these two newcivilizations met, each of them committed to world revolution, both of them solong isolated that they were only now, in their confrontation, compelled toconsider their commitments. The Declaration of Independence did not say that allEnglishmen—or their overseas colonists —were created equal. It said that all menwere created equal, and with certain inalienable rights. The CommunistManifesto, too, proclaimed the equal rights of all men but, denying creation,deprived the rights of their inalienability. Down the middle of Germany thequarrel, avoidable, perhaps, if the two revolutions had not found root in thetwo repositories of world power at the moment, was joined in 1945.Now, what makes civilizing so hard is that, even if the primitives recognizetheir own condition as primitive (which I don't know that they do), they do notalways recognize that of the civilized as superior. The Germans, for example,had thought themselves, and not other people, superior. And, in addition, theimpeccability of the civilizing intention is always clouded by suspicion and thesuspicion fortified by events of recent memory. Being beaten is not the bestimmediate preliminary to being civilized or reeducated or reoriented. Thepost-Nazi Germans were bound to have difficulty, for a while, in believing thatthose who had beaten them so bloody and burned their country down had done sofor their own good or were interested in their own good now. The nature of thecase was against us, evenThe Re-educators Re-educatedin genuine peacetime conditions, which, certainly after 1948, no longerobtained.Still, as the American Occupation learned that what was done in ten centuriescannot be undone in ten days, some small progress might have been made in time.As the sting of punishment, collection, and control was relieved, receptivity tothe American world revolutionary effort might grow in Germany, and the effortitself, if only it were not abandoned in a new isolationist temper in America,might become more imaginative. By 1948 there were signs of hope. No West Germanwould have said, outside an official statement, that his government was free,much less democratic; but words like \"freedom\" and \"democracy\" were everywhereheard, especially among the rising generation.The public schools were full of free books, free movies, and free lectures inpraise of freedom and free enterprise, in praise, above all, of peace. And thepupils were memorizing the blessings of democracy as assiduously as their olderbrothers had memorized the blessings of National Socialism. More significantly,the private elementary and secondary schools, from which public school reformhad always emerged, were alive again in the land.Of the universities, \"it is difficult to predict ... but a start has been made,\"said James M. Read, very cautiously, when he resigned as education chief of theUnited States High Commission in 1951. The intellectual sheep and goats werestill separated at the age of ten or eleven, but, if a higher education wasstill beyond the children of three-fourths of the people, the West Germanuniversities, most of whose students were working their way through, no longerhad to plead guilty to the Communist charge that, where the East Germanuniversities put a premium on poverty as a condition for admission, those in theWest excluded the work-ingman's son altogether. A chair of political science or social researchappeared here and there, and there were, in five or six universities in theAmerican and English (and even, at Tubingen, in the French) zones of occupation,government-supported or at least government-tolerated efforts to introduce aprogram of general education on the fringe of the specialized curriculum.No American would have said in 1948, outside an official report, that atransformation had been wrought, or even wedged, in the German nationalcharacter except on one point, and that was militarism. \"The war-making power ofGermany should be eliminated/' General Eisenhower of SHEAF told Henry Morgenthauand Harry Dexter White in 1944, and everybody present and absent agreed withhim. In 1945 the Americans interrogated some 13,000,000 individual Germans—andindicted some 3,500,000 of them—under a statute \"for the de-Nazification anddemilitarization of Germany.\" In his 1946 speech in Stuttgart, United StatesSecretary of State Byrnes reaffirmed the Potsdam principle that Germany shouldbe permanently demilitarized and added: \"It is not in the interest of the Germanpeople or in the interest of world peace that Germany should become a pawn orpartner in a military struggle for power between the East and West\"; and in 1949the new Bonn Government pledged \"its earnest determination to maintain thedemilitarization of the Federal territory and to endeavor by all means in itspower to prevent the recreation of armed forces of any kind/'Everywhere the German turned, he was told that American idealism had come toliberate him forever from the curse of militarism, from its money cost, its costin life, and its cost in reducing his character to barracks-room ser-The Re-educators Re-educatedvility. And, with a readiness that should, perhaps, have been disturbing, heseemed to believe what he was told.It is hard to exaggerate the impression which this American ideal made upon theGermans—an impression supported, of course, by their own experience of thesecond Thirty Years' War of 1914-45. \"The German people display no eagerness formilitary service,\" High Commissioner McCloy was able to report. 'The distastefor military service as such [is] something new in German life.\" Then, suddenly,in 1948, with the cold war warming up in Berlin, the American ideal wasreversed.CHAPTER 29The Reluctant PhoenixThe first modest proposal, heard in late 1948, was to arm the West Germanpolice, on the ground that the Russians had already armed an East German policeforce. But this little tit-for-tat soon gave way to the call for twelve WestGerman divisions. \"The Germans are great fighters/' said Senator Thomas ofOklahoma in late 1949. \"If the United States gets into a war, we shall needfighters.\" \"It should be enough/' said General Collins of the United StatesJoint Chiefs of Staff in 1950, \"if we send arms. Our sons must not shed theirblood in Europe.\" Shortly thereafter, the New York Times put it in plainAmerican: \"America has the right to demand a dollar's worth of fight for everydollar it spends.\"But the phoenix showed no disposition to rise from its ashes. The \"war men\" weretired, dead tired, of war, and General Eisenhower of NATO felt called upon toreassure them in 1950: \"If the Allies were to rearm the Germans, they would berepudiating a whole series of agreements. It has been announced officially inWashington, London, and Paris that no such action is contemplated.\" And so ithad been. But the Germans were so tired, and so vocally tired, that the Generalwas moved, as late as 1951, to inform Washington, London, and Paris that hewanted \"no reluctant divisions in an army under my command.\"The Reluctant PhoenixHe was, however, going to get them. The West German Security Commissioner—therewas, of course, no War Ministry—announced that Germany would conscript300,000-400,000 men. (It was peacetime conscription which Wood-row Wilson called\"the root evil of Prussianism.\") There would be, when the Germans (not to saythe French) could be brought to accept the American \"contractual agreement,\" inaddition to peacetime conscription, nine new Panzer divisions, and \"the Germancontingent will dispose directly of its own air force\" of 75,000 men and 1,500fighters and fighter-bombers. This \"German contingent\" (the SecurityCommissioner did not need to add) would be as strong as the forces with whichHitler attacked the West in 1939, and (the Security Commissioner did not add,but the Pleven Plan did) the national units of the European Defense Communitywould be, \"in the beginning,\" under national, not international, control.A few months after the beginning of hostilities in Korea, the American, British,and French foreign ministers took note—without expressing their own views—of\"the sentiments expressed in Germany and elsewhere in favor of Germanparticipation in an integrated force.\" The sentiments were not confined, eitherin Germany or elsewhere, to governmental or militarist circles; in America,Walter Lippmann, writing in the very conservative internationalist New YorkHerald Tribune, was convinced that \"Germany as a nation can be brought willinglyinto a Western coalition only if we can prove to them that we have the militarypower and that it is our strategic purpose to carry the war immediately andswiftly beyond the Vistula River.\" (It would not be the first time that the warhad been carried immediately and swiftly beyond the Vistula River; the lasttime, Hitler did it.) And in Germany the very conserva-tive nationalist Stuttgart Zeitung thought that \"it is very probable that GreatBritain's value to America as an ally will soon sharply depreciate. This wouldbe tremendously important for us Germans. ... If Anglo-American frictionincreases and Britain's position becomes weaker, we may expect that America mayassign an increasing importance to Germany's role on the Continent/*After the 1953 elections in Germany, the Adenauer Government had enough power inParliament to override the German Supreme Court's unwillingness to find thatGerman remilitarization was permitted by the Constitution forced upon Germany bythe victorious Allies of 1945. (The same thing was happening in Japan, where thenew Constitution forbidding militarization forever had actually to be amended.)German industry, said General Hays, the Deputy United States High Commissioner,would be able to start turning out armaments \"within six to nine months ofreceiving orders/' and in 1953 Krupp of Essen, the company that built the Naziwar machine, displayed its new line of vehicles, complete with turretemplacements. \"Once the go-ahead is given,\" Foreign Aid Director Stassen toldthe United States House of Representatives Appropriations Committee in the fallof 1954, \"you will see one of the fastest jobs of building an army in modernhistory. The necessary equipment, most of which will be furnished by the UnitedStates, is well on the way.\"Meanwhile, everything had been changed in the \"Coca-Cola Zone\" of West Germany.What was left of the American engine for re-education and reorientation wasthrown into reverse, to serve the campaign for a new German Wehr-macht. Thestill-wet picture of the Curse of Militarism was turned to every wall, and thenot-yet-dusty old masterpiece of the Defense of the Fatherland was rehung. MuchcouldThe Reluctant Phoenixstill be said, and done, against Communism. But not much could be done any moreabout the re-education of the Germans. Their re-education had been based tooheavily on the theme that militarism had been the cornerstone of Germantotalitarianism, German war, and German ruin.There were hitches here and there. At a fracas in Frankfurt in 1952 the Germanpolice picked up a flying squad of the Bund Deutscher Jugend, whose specialtywas breaking up Communist, Social Democratic, and neutralist meetings. A fewweeks later Minister President Zinn of the State of Hesse announced that the BDJhad been \"created and financed by the United States\" and that, on United Statesorders, it had set up a \"technical service\" to go into action in case ofCommunist invasion. This \"technical service\" was composed of one to two thousandformer German officers up to the rank of colonel, all of them over thirty-fiveyears of age. (Bund Deutscher Jugend means \"German Youth League\"). Many of themwere former Nazi SS men. (Mere membership in the black-uniformed Schutzstaffelhad been condemned at Nuremberg as criminal.) The \"technical service\" was beingtrained, with all kinds of light weapons, in a disguised lumber camp maintainedby the United States in the Odenwald. (The penalty, under the Allied ControlLaw, for arming Germans was death and was still in force.)What most exercised President Zinn—a Social Democrat —was the \"technicalservice's\" list of West German \"un-reliables\" to be \"removed.\" The list includedfifteen Communists—and eighty Social Democrats, including the entire nationalleadership of the latter party. It included, in addition, the only Jewish memberof the German Parliament. The \"technical service,\" said President Zinn, cost theUnited States taxpayers $11,000 a month, HICOG-the United States High Commission for the Occupation of Germany—knew nothingabout it. Neither did General Eisenhower of NATO or President Truman of theUnited States or, of course, Chancellor Adenauer of Germany.But everybody else knew something about it. The ''technical service\" wasmaintained by the United States Central Intelligence Agency, created by theUnited States National Security Council with a rumored budget of $500,000,000completely concealed in the departmental appropriations of the United StatesCongress. \"One would like to assume/ 7 said the pro-West Frankfurter Rundschau,\"that the secret American sponsors knew nothing of the assassination plans.However, their support of a Fascist underground movement is bound to producedistrust of American officials. We refuse to fight Stalinism with the help ofFascism.\"It was only a hitch, of course. And the Germans had been taught to have shortmemories. Still—. Two years later, in the hullabaloo that attended thedisappearance of Dr. Otto John, \"West Germany's J. Edgar Hoover/' it developedthat John, who reappeared in East Germany, did not like Nazis and had beenhaving trouble with the Siid-deutsche Industrieverwertung, or South GermanIndustrial Development Organization. The Development Organization was, as itdeveloped, a barbed-wire-surrounded compound of 30 acres in the dreamy Bavarianvillage of Pullach, in the American Zone. The Development Organization wasdeveloping a spy network of 4,000 agents in the Soviet Union. The cost of thedevelopment, according to the moderate, right-of-center Paris-Presse of August27, 1954, was six million American dollars a year. And the Director of theDevelopment was former Brigadier-General Rheinhardt Gehlen, Nazi intelligencechief in the Soviet Union duringThe Reluctant Phoenixthe second World War. His new job, said the Paris-Presse, was \"to carry on forthe United States the work he had begun for Hitler/'It was only a hitch, of course, but such hitches are mortal to mewling idealism.The Germans had been taught to have short memories, but there were a few whosememories carried them all the way back to the former German captain whopersuaded the Allies to let his \"Freedom Movement\" have a few rusty old guns torepulse the Communists in Bavaria after the first World War. The captain's namewas Rohm, Ernst Rohm. Could it have been the same Captain Ernst Rohm who foundedthe National Socialist Party?CHAPTER 3 0Born YesterdayAll the Germans were not born yesterday. But some of them were; and youth is thetime of ideals. When the West German Security Commissioner announced the detailsof remilitarization—including peacetime conscription—the London Observer'scorrespondent reported, on the basis of public opinion polls, that \"thepercentage of support for a German defense contribution dropped below 15, andthe percentage of outspoken opposition, about 40 to 50 for the population ingeneral, reached nearly 75 for the age groups directly concerned\"—that is, forthe young people. Student polls taken in three universities in Germany—withoutofficial sanction or supervision—showed opposition so nearly unanimous that thescientific basis of the polling went unchallenged. Youth is the time of ideals,and in the German generation that had known only war's horrors and none of itsglories the pre-1948 American Occupation had planted an ideal that was brand-newin Germany.The American \"exchange programs\" for German students, professors, journalists,and public officials had been screened from the start, to bring onlypro-American Germans to America. Now—after 1948—the candidates were asked whatthey thought of the remilitarization of theirBorn Yesterdaycountry, \"I'm against it,\" one of the high-school seniors who was accepted forthe program told me, \"but I said I was for it. You know, 90 per cent of ourgraduating class at the Realgymnasium signed a petition against remilitarizationa month before my examination for the program. My name was on the petition, butI assumed that the American officials in our town had not sent it to theAmerican examiners in Frankfurt, and I was right/'\"Why/' I said, \"did you guess that the petition had never been sent toFrankfurt?\"\"Because everybody tells his superior what his superior wants to hear, and thesuperior in Frankfurt does not want to hear about opposition toremilitarization. Look, Professor, we are used to this in Germany/'The young people's resistance to remilitarization was led by German churchmen,Protestant and Catholic, especially in the anti-Nazi Confessional Church, the\"church within the Church\" which is the most vigorous and numerous branch ofGerman Protestantism. In mid-1950, when Pastor Mochalski, Secretary of theConfessional Church Council, established the Darmstadt Action Groups againstremilitarization, the movement spread from the Darmstadt Institute of Technologyto the Universities of Frankfurt, Mainz, Heidelberg, Tubingen, and Freiburg.Americans who were \"warned\" by the United States Consul in Frankfurt to keepaway from this \"Communist-dominated outfit\" and who asked to see the evidencewere told, \"That's impossible. The evidence is classified.\"Notices of meetings of the Niemoller-Heinemann-Wes-sel group of Protestants andCatholics opposing militarization were torn down by culprits unknown. But inKronen-berg, late in 1952, huge posters appeared on the kiosksshowing a hairy red hand, tattooed with the hammer and sickle, seizing the thinwhite arm of a woman, over the caption \"Deine Frau, Herr Ohne Mich/\" \"Your Wife,Mr. l-Won't-Fight-in-the-Next-WarT' The source of the posters being unknown,they would ordinarily have been confiscated by the police. But they weren't. \"Weare used to this, too/' said my friend, the exchange student. \"It may be thatthis poster was left over in Dr. Goebbels' store-room.\"Cynicism, the deepest cynicism, in Germany, among a people who, rather thanbelieve in nothing, will turn to the most fantastic of faiths; cynicism amongthe young people, and youth is the time for ideals. Not that their elders wereany less cynical, but, then, age is the time for disenchantment. \"I suppose/'said my friend Klingelhofer, the cabinetmaker, \"that the Occupation law 'for thede-Nazification and demilitarization of Germany' is repealed, now that we are tobe remilitarized. Are we to be re-Nazi-fied, too?\"Were they? A transition had set in among the Germans, a transition from the viewthat the American Way was, perhaps, better than their own to the view that theAmerican Way was very good, indeed, but no better than theirs. The German press,controlled as it was by the Occupation, expressed itself by the amount of spaceit gave news, and it gave an extraordinary amount of space to the development of\"McCarthyism\" in the United States and especially to the incursion ofbook-burning into the libraries of the Amerika-Hauser. The bolder newspapersexpressed themselves editorially, the anti-Communist Mfinchner Merkur nominatingSenator McCarthy for honorary membership in the Communist Party and theanti-CommunistBorn YesterdayWeser-Kurier saying that Goebbels would have appreciated the Wisconsin Senator.\"We in Germany/' said the anti-Communist Mannheimer Morgen, \"are fed up withwhat we had last time, when a whole party of McCarthys tried to control ourthinking.\" Some Germans were born yesterday; not all of them.CHAPTER 3 1Tug of PeaceThe new German joke was: \"How do the Germans feel about the situation?\"—\"Well,how does a bone feel between two dogs?\" Pressure, once more, new pressure on topof all the old pressures unrelieved by war, destruction, and defeat. The Nazirallying cry had been, \"Germany, awaken!\" Now the Americans and the Russianswere crying the same cry. In time the Germans would yield to the new pressures*It would certainly be easier to re-re-educate Germans to militarism than tore-educate them away from it. \"I wish,\" said a German pastor, \"that we Germansdidn't believe so easily.\"The consequences of the pressure, of being needed, wanted, for war again, ofbeing wooed wherever they went, they who so recently had been the world'suntouchables, can only be guessed at; but they can be guessed at. \"The Germantragedy,\" said Reinhold Schneider, one of Germany's great living men of letters,\"is as deep as ever. It is that nothing can be regarded as having a life of itsown. Everything—whether music, or art, or religion, or literature —is judgedalmost exclusively on its conceivable political bearing. The most tortured andfar-fetched conclusions are drawn from productions that were only created out ofthe urge to create or, if they had a goal, to enhance the outreach of the humanspirit. Of course I am aware of the social re-Tug of Peacesponsibility of the artist, but to go over to the Marxist thesis, as the Westseems to be doing, that everything is only an incident to a great political, andultimately economic, movement is to sell out something that will impoverish theworld, certainly to sell out that early hope that something new in the humanplastic might emerge out of Germany's pain/'That was one way of putting it, but there were not many putting it that way.There were more who saw remilitarization as the only way to sovereignty; thesewere the nationalists. There were more who saw it as the way to professionalactivity; these were the ex-officers. There were more who saw it as the way to ajob; these were the unemployed. And there were some ten million \"expellees\"(nobody had ever bothered to count them) forced into post-Nazi Germany from theliberated countries by the victors who decided at Potsdam that Hitler was right,after all: there was such a thing as a \"German race/' and its members,classified at Potsdam as \"German ethnics,\" would have to live in Germany. The\"expellees\" were an immense and ever growing force for war against Russia astheir only hope of getting back home.Growing, too, among the Germans, was the most intense pressure of all, thepressure to reunite their country, infinitely more intense than the pressure toregain the lost colonies in the twenties. West (and East) Germans had norelatives in German West Africa, but they all had relatives in East (and West)Germany. A new Hitlerism, if it arose in West Germany, would need only one plankin its platform: reunification. In 1953 the West Germans re-elected a Chancellorwho told them, a 1'Am^ricafne, \"We talk a lot about unification. Let us talk ofliberation.\" But, when any speaker in Germany, West or East, used the wordEinheit, unity, nomatter how he used it, he was interrupted by wild, Sports-Palast-like cheering.Unfortunately, Einhcit was an old Nazi term, too. Still more unfortunately,Einheit, along with Friede, peace, was the slogan the hated Communists hadpainted on walls and billboards all over East Germany—on walls and billboardsfacing the West. The Germans, East and West, wanted the Americans out ofGermany—five minutes after the Russians were out. But the Russians, who lost17,000,000 people in the last war, would not get out, and neither would theAmericans, who did not want to lose 17,000,000 people in the next one. TheOccupation—West as well as East—was a matter of might. Might was something theGermans could understand without being re-educated or reoriented.The Germans in the East did not appear to believe that they would get bothEinheit and Friede from the Russians. The Americans did not speak of Einheit andFriede to the Germans in the West. They spoke of Verteidigung, defense, andoffered it free. Well, the Germans wanted defense, too, above all against\"Bolshevism.\" But defense was the offer made them by their own government in1914 and in 1939, and in 1914 and in 1939 defense meant war. The Germans did notwant war. They did not want peace at any price, but they did not want war at theprice of death, and that was the price, when they were allowed to think aboutit, that they thought they would have to pay.The German dilemma was, perhaps, most acute in Germany, but it wasn't really aGerman dilemma; it was the dilemma of Europe. If defense meant death, one had toconsider defense very seriously. But the Germans could see the dilemma mostacutely, because they could see that the Americans and the Russians were agreedthat, if they had to fight each other, they would both prefer to do it in Ger-Tug of Peacemany. The Germans could see that, wherever the third World War ended, it wouldbegin where they were, and their broken stones would be reduced to dust.In the re-election of the conservative coalition of Adenauer in 1953, thecentral issue was the economy. Almost half the Bonn budget was going for socialservices; one-fifth of the population was directly supported by the State onpensions or doles. Still, the day after V-E Day, five-fifths were unsupported byanybody, and in 1953 the Germans were not in the mood to shoot even a thin SantaGlaus. In the fall elections of 1954 the mood had changed—or, rather, the focus.Everywhere, even in Catholic Bavaria, Adenauer lost support and lost itradically. What had happened? What had happened was that the \"European DefenseCommunity,\" with its fagade of an international army, had collapsed, and theAdenauer Government, under the most intense pressure from the United States, wastrying to deliver a German Army, complete with a German General Staff, under thenew \"London Agreement/'The phoenix was dragging its talons. Professor Hans Morgenthau, of theUniversity of Chicago, returned from a visit to his native land in the summer of1954 and reported that he had raised the question of German rearmament \"withscores of all kinds of people. I found only one man who came out in favor of it,and he is closely identified with the Adenauer Government.\" He added that \"allfour living ex-chancellors of Germany, representing the most diverse colors ofthe political spectrum from the extreme right of Papen to the extreme left ofWirth, have declared their opposition to the Western orientation of the Bonnregime.\" In the winter of 1954-55 the West German \"Security Commissioner\" washaving the greatest difficulty in persuading young men to register voluntarilyfor the when-and-if \"defense force.\" At a mass meeting in Cologne, the magazine U.S. News &World Report said that the Security Commissioner \"found more conscientiousobjectors than anything else. A check in key areas of West Germany indicatesthat the attitude of the young men at Cologne is typical of much of the country.Hardly anyone signs up. Anti-militarism suddenly has become one of the mostpopular political issues.\"\"Conscientious objectors\" to volunteering are not, of course, conscientiousobjectors to conscription. \"Actually,\" U.S. News & World Report concluded,\"nobody in West Germany seriously doubts any more that the country will have anarmy by one means or another. But it is becoming apparent that the Germansoldiers of the future will be very different from the German troops who went towar in 1870, 1914, and 1939.\" \"Fight?\" said one of those anonymous officialswith whom I spoke in Berlin. \"Of course the Germans will fight. But they willfight a tired war, the way the French fought in 1940.\"The Germans want, not at all oddly, to live. They would like to live well, butin any case they would like to live, well or badly. Their attitude may beunheroic; they ought, perhaps, to prefer dying on their feet to living on theirknees. But they don't; and, unlike us, who have had neither experience, theyhave had both. What we, who have never been slaves, call slavery, they, who havealways been what we call slaves, find less abhorrent than death. They hateCommunism—under that name—but they do not love what we call liberty enough todie for it. If they did, they would have died for it against Hitler.Americans who saw the love of liberty in the East-West refugee traffic and theEast German riots needed to remind themselves that these same East Germans livedunder totali-Tug of Peacetarian slavery for twelve years, 1933-45, and loved it. They did not even callit slavery. Those of them who hated it (and there were, of course, many) couldhave emigrated in much better style than those who are now arriving from theEast, but emigration during those twelve years, except for those whom thetotalitarian dictatorship drove away, was almost nil.CHAPTER 32\"Are We the Same as the Russians?\"The nineteenth century of Europe left untouched only three great bulwarks ofautocracy—Russia, Prussia, and Austria. These were, in the phrase of the time,the three eastern great powers, in which the pattern of postfeudal absolutism,serving an agrarian and military nobility, with a subservient church appended,still survived in the West. German royalty's predilection for France andEngland—and its intermarriage with the latter's ruling house—gave the world aneasy impression of Western orientation, which was fortified by the spectacularindustrialization of the new Reich under Bismarck. But the perennialpreoccupation of German scholarship with Russia (and vice versa) might have beena better clue to the future of Europe than the didoes of court society.Russia (whose history has been epitomized as the search for a warm-water port)and Germany are the two have-nots, subjectively, with a long history of like,and co-operative, behavior, beginning with their postmedieval continentalcolonization (including a half-dozen amiable partitions of Poland) and theirfailure (or inability) to colonize abroad. Bismarck's support of Russia's BlackSea ambitions; the German General Staff's support of the October Revolution;Rapallo; the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact—all these are seen,\"Are We the Same as the Russians?\"quite rightly, as German policy in a perpetual pincers situation. ButGerman-Russian relations have always been happier than the relations of eitherone with the other European great powers. Behind the events of the immediatepast are five centuries of remarkably peaceful penetration of the western Slavworld by German traders and agriculturists and the concomitant Slavic influenceon the East Prussian and Silesian temperaments.We are late in discovering the essential resemblance of Communism and Nazism,diverted perhaps by the \"advanced\" condition of the Germans, perhaps by theconfusion of Soviet Communism with democratic socialism; perhaps by both. Butthe circulatory course of anti-Semitism— from fourteenth century Germany toRussia (via the partitioning of Poland at the end of the eighteenth century),from Russia to Austria in the nineteenth, and from Austria back to Germany inthe twentieth—should itself have been a sign of the singular congeniality of thePan-German and Pan-Russian nationalisms. But it was not until the 1930's, whenNational Socialism overcame Germany, that we discovered, to our amazement, thatthe aboriginal \"folk family,\" the herd sense of the tribe, was as deeply set inthe Germans as it was in the Russians.Some of the Germans have not discovered it yet. In Hamburg I was meeting with agroup of students, and the discussion turned to Russia. \"You don't know theRussians,\" said one of the students, addressing, apparently, not just me but thegroup generally. \"I say that you do not know the Russians. I do. They have noidea of freedom. They would not know how to use it if they had it. They are aprimitive, animal-like people. They simply have no conception of humanity or ofhuman rights. I had a friend who was in aRussian concentration camp. What they do there is hideous. You wouldn't believeit.\" Another student spoke up: \"I had a friend who was in a German concentrationcamp. What they did there was hideous. You wouldn't believe it.\" The firststudent was enraged. \"Are you saying/' he shouted, \"that we are the same as theRussians?\"CHAPTER 33Marx Talks to Michel\"When two Russians fight/' so the joke goes, \"they tear each other's clothes offand then shake hands. When two Germans fight, they kill each other, but therewon't be a button missing/ 7 The German's bourgeois development came late—theRussian's never—and his private property sense is as overdeveloped as a child's.But the Thirty Years' War of 1914-45 has proletarianized this man of privateproperty, especially the bourgeoisie. In the inflation of 1945-48, as in 1919-23(when, however, the retailers with stocks survived), the farmer not only heldhis own but traded food for whatever he wanted, and there were \"Persian rugs inpigsties.\" Then the currency reform, on both occasions, hit the farmer, and hisdownward course began to follow that of the bourgeoisie.The higher bourgeois were the first and the hardest and the most persistentlyproletarianized. They may not know it yet; Herr Doctor Schmidt or Herr LawyerSchmidt or Herr Professor Schmidt or Herr Architect Schmidt or Herr EngineerSchmidt still has his professional title, and his title is property, as it isnowhere else in the Western world. But he has no real property, no tangiblestake left in the social order. He has nothing to sell but his labor. Marx istalking to him.A university department head in Kronenberg had no hotwater and no central heat in his four-room apartment, with a household of fouradults and two children. Eight years and more after the war his family stillgladly accepted gifts of used clothing, the crumbs of charity. I see him now,sifting his pipe dottle, looking for unburned flakes; I see his wife using tealeaves a second time, a third time, a fourth time. In a year in Kronenberg Iencountered only one owner of a private automobile, and not one refrigerator.Eggs were sold by the unit; who had money to invest in a dozen at a time, or aplace to keep them fresh?In our older boy's class, the sixth grade, in a school in our bourgeois,nonindustrial, county-seat town in a fertile valley, 10 per cent of the childrenwere, eight years after the war, going to school without breakfast; the next 10per cent had unspread bread; the next 10 per cent, bread with a nonfat spread;and only the top 30 per cent had any kind of milk or milk-substitute drink undertheir belts. Our younger boy, in the first grade, brought his new friend Bienethome with him and gave him a banana. Bienet ate the banana—and the skin.And all this was in \"recovery\" Germany, West Germany, where the living standardhad always been higher than it was in the East and was now, of course, very muchhigher. And in a small town surrounded by woods, in this \"recovery\" Germany,only kitchens were heated in winter for want of a few cents for kindling. MyNazi friend, young Schwenke, recommended to me a cigarette-rolling machine witha cloth, rather than a plastic, roller; I asked him why he himself used themachine with the plastic roller; it was because it cost two and a half centsless than the other.Of course there were mink coats in Diisseldorf, the Rouge-et-Noir (as theGermans call it) was packed day and night at Baden-Baden, and there wereblock-long MercedesMarx Talks to Michellimousines in Berlin. But, when the limousines had gone by, one might see themen, young men, middle-aged men, old men, going through the garbage cans (as ifthere were anything edible to be found in a German garbage can!). Nowhere wasthe assertion challenged that the spread between wealth and poverty in WestGermany was much greater than it had been under the Nazis.\"Production is 150 per cent of prewar/' But what is important is what isproduced and where it goes. What was being produced in \"recovery\" Germany wasnot domestic consumer goods; machine tools are hard on the teeth. The soaringWest German economy was an artifact, a political, cold-war, pump-primingoperation like the soaring (if not so high) East German economy. To pile up thegold and dollar balance, tax concessions (paid ultimately by Michel, thestandard chump of German comedy) were given exporters. Some of the units of theI.G. Farben chemical combine, broken up after the war, were bigger than ever;one typewriter manufacturer was exporting to one hundred and thirty-ninecountries.\"Production is 150 per cent of prewar/' But of Volkswagen's twenty thousandemployees (including executives), only 2 per cent could afford to drive the carsthey were making. In \"150 per cent\" 1953, the West German industrial wage wasless than one-fourth of the American, the standard of living 15 per cent belowthat of armaments-saddled France, the per capita consumption of meat (which wasun-rationed) lower than austerity England's (which was rationed). The \"150 percent\" was not going to the fifty million West Germans.Since the end of the war, Germany, the only nation in Europe which did not enjoythe sovereign privilege of spending one-third to one-half its national budget ona mili-tary establishment, had constructed six times as many new housing units as\"victorious\" France; but it was still short four million units, and housing wasstill rationed to a maximum of one person per room. Unemployment figures,notoriously unreliable, ranged from a likely two million to an unlikely onemillion. There were no exact figures distinguishing part-time employment fromemployment and no exact figures on the ten million \"expellees/'There were some simple distinctions which one might make—could not helpmaking—by walking across the Pots-darner Platz in Berlin. In Communist EastBerlin no worker was free—or unemployed; in Capitalist West Berlin one of everyfour workers was unemployed—but free. In Kronen-berg, which had no heavyindustry, unemployment of the normal working force (swelled by the \"expellees\")was 20 per cent in 1953, and an unemployed white-collar worker, with a family offour in one room, got a dole totaling $31.74 a month. He paid one-fourth ourmoney price for rent, half our money price for food, and as much as we pay forall manufactured articles (including fuel and clothing). Our ten-cent bar ofsoap cost twenty-four cents in West Germany.German men were coming down in money value as German materials went up; ashoemaker would work half an hour making repairs which did not require leatheror rubber, and the bill would be twelve cents, but when he worked ten minutesputting on a pair of half-soles and heels, the bill was $2.50. The German people(not to be confused with German export and German industry) had not beenrehabilitated. And they had not been rehabilitated by American aid. True, \"they\"had received three billion dollars in aid; true, too, they (without thequotation marks) had paid ten billion dollars in Occupation costs. And theMarx Talks to Michelaid, whatever forms it had taken and whichever persons it had reached, was,under the Marshall Plan and its successors, $28 per person in Germany, while itwas $63 per person in England and $65 in France.Whatever rehabilitation there was in Germany—the spectacular reconstruction notof the destroyed cities but in them—was the result of the back-breaking toil ofseventy million German Michels. Tante Kathe, our housekeeper, was one of theseMichels. \"Work and save, Michel/ 7 Tante Kathe worked and saved. Twice sheworked, and each time she saved close to $2,000, and each time, after 1918 and1945, her $2,000 was inflated away. Tante Kathe, who reads and writes only theold German script, doesn't read or write much. She doesn't even know (any morethan the shoemaker, whose materials are worth more than he is) that Marx istalking to her.The German's acute property sense and his acute security sense have been at warwithin him during this whole second Thirty Years' War of 1914-45. The securitysense is winning. The development of German anticapitalism was 7 at the turn ofthe century, phenomenal. In the first Reichstag, in 1871, the Social DemocraticParty had two seats; in 1903, eighty-one; and before the first World War, withone hundred and ten seats, they were the strongest party in the country. In 1932the anticapitalist forces held two-thirds of the Reichstag seats—the LeftCenter, the Social Democrats, the Communists, and the Nazis (the last receivingprivate support from German capital).The dispossession of the German, especially of the middle class and mostespecially of the upper middle class, has been going on since the middle of thefirst World War, relentlessly, in \"good\" times and in \"bad,\" moving towardcompletion. The propertyless Burger does not cast his lot withthe proletariat; but sooner or later his lot casts him. He lives (and, if he isold enough, dies) in his memories of die goldene Zeit, the golden time of thefirst Kaiserreich; but the grandchildren—it may be even the children—of this manhave, without personal memory to sustain their illusions, lost them. When thesituation has been bad enough long enough, there seems to be a neuroticincongruity, with only one entrance door for three families, in maintaining thehereditary doorplate with the family name engraved on it. So the grandson—or theson—takes it down. Marx is talking to him.Marx doesn't care if, in this outbreak or that, or in this or that locality, hecalls himself a Nazi, a Fascist, a Communist, a Nationalist, or an Odd Fellow.Marx is talking to the naked condition of his existence, not to the insignia inhis lapel. \"One hundred and fifty per cent of prewar\" is the mumbo jumbo of deadfinanciers. Nothing costs money like war, whoever wins or loses. Nothingmass-produces proletarians like war, whoever wins or loses. Whoever wins orloses, Marx is talking to the man whose house and savings are gone, who hasnothing to sell but his labor. Let the dead financiers talk of \"150 per cent ofprewar\"; Marx knows that England and France, whose productive capacity, far frombeing destroyed, was scarcely touched, never recovered from the first World War.In the midst of the broken stones, the twisted steel, the burned-out shop, andthe flooded mine stands the new proletarian: the German.Remember—the Germans were rich once, by European standards, and now they arepoor; so, subjectively, they are much worse off now than those who were alwayspoor. They are approaching the point—no one knows where it is—where they willknow that they are what they already are: proletarians. Between 1945 and 1955 itwas costing Michel onlyMarx Talks to Michel$155,000,000 a month to maintain the military forces that occupied his country;the minute he got his own military forces, that is, his \"defense contribution\"to \"European defense,\" it would cost him $215,000,000 a month, just as astarter.Michel hates Communism—under that name. But Hitler communized him, underNational Socialism, and he never knew it. If this process of coming down in theworld—not of being down but of coming down—continues, Michel will embrace somenew, as yet unconceived \"anti-Communism.\" But it will be Communism, just asNational Socialism was, but more advanced in so far as materials, rising invalue as men's value falls, are increasingly available only in collective form.And there is no reason, when the hatred of 1941-45 dies away, why this Communism(called, perhaps, \"anti-Communism\") should not be Russian, or Russian-German, athird Rapallo of the have-nots, who, like all have-nots, dream of beinghave-alls. There is, of course, the chance (on which Churchill bet and lostonce) that the parties to the third Rapallo may destroy one another; but thischance is ever the rich man's dream.Bourgeois pride, the title, the doorplate, the bow the higher Beamte receivesfrom the lower, stand between Germany and Russia, but the pride, the title, thedoorplate, and the bow are coming down. What the Germans did in Russia in thelate war—and what the Russians did in Germany afterward—stands between them,too. The slogans of anti-Communism, pounded into the Germans by the NaziGovernment and later by the American Occupation, these, too, will live for awhile. But Frederick the Great and Bismarck, looking eastward, will outlive boththe Nazis and the American Occupation. \"Everyone knows,\" said the realisticWalter Lippmann late in 1954, \"that the pull within Ger-many toward such a deal\"—between West Germany and the Soviet Union—\"is bound tobe very strong, and to become all the stronger as Germany acquires greatmilitary power in her own right. The Russians/ 7 he went on, \"hold big assetsfor a deal with the Germans: unification, withdrawal of the Army of Occupation,rectification of the frontiers, resettlement of the expelled refugees, trade,and great political influence in the destiny of Europe.\" The realist might havebeen even more realistic and added that Marx is talking to more Germans todaythan in 1914—or in 1939.CHAPTER 34The Uncalcuhted RiskThe way to relieve the pressure is to relieve the pressure. If, at whatevercost, the salvation of Germany, and therefore of Europe, and therefore ofcivilization, must be achieved, the test of every measure must be the test urgedby the late Prime Minister of India: \"Does it add to tension or not?*' TheOccidental who deplores the renunciation of both right and might implied heremust narrow his eyes to an Oriental squint and keep them on the ball. If theGermans make the rest of the world suffer because they themselves suffer, and ifthey themselves suffer because they are under pressure, why, the first thing todo is to get the pressure off them. Niceties such as right and might must wait.Take the pressure off them, and they might become insufferable. But they becameinsufferable with the pressure on them. Take the pressure off them, and theymight claim that they won the last war. But that would be better than theirclaiming that they will win the next war. Take the pressure off them, and theymight rearm. But they always have anyway. Take the pressure off them, and theymight go Communist. But they did go Nazi.The trouble is that the relief of the Germans would require something like theprior reconstruction of the world. To initiate-—even to contemplate—a program ofrelief, there would have to be the kind of world that did not react to theproposal by asking, rhetorically, if the Germans are to be coddled for theircrimes and paid off for losing the wars they started. It would have to be aworld that could see beyond the end of its nose and turn that nose—together withthe rest of its face—from the past to the future. It would have to be a worldwith—a Weltanschauung.To say that this is not the kind of world we live in, or are soon likely to,would be to supererogate. A world that was disposed to relieve the Germans ofpressure would have to be a world that itself was not under pressure, a worldthat breathed freely. So far are we from living in such a world that the twopowers now dividing the world there is are both falling victim to the paranoidpanic which brought Germany to its present pass, both of them sacrificing allother objectives to encircle their encirclers. In this one respect, at least,has Goebbels' perverse prediction been validated: \"Even if we lose, we shallwin, for our ideals will have penetrated the hearts of our enemies.\"In such a world—the world we live in—such dreams as a United States of Europeare no further advanced in Europe than World Federalism is here. The EuropaUnion movement, in Germany as elsewhere, is widespread among, and only among,nongovernmental intellectuals, and especially among the young. At the Universityof Munich 88 per cent of the students, in a random sampling, favored \"theunification of Europe\" over \"German sovereignty.\" But \"the unification ofEurope\" means different things to different men —to some peace, to others war.And it is an ideal much more nebulous, and much more limited, than democracy. Inthe context of the world struggle, European Union means, first, military unionof non-Communist Europe; second, economic union (presently supported by both theyoung idealists and the old cartelists); and last, if ever, political union. AndThe Uncalculated Riskany union that left Germany divided would take place only on paper, if there.There may be a possibility that the relief of the Germans would interest theRussians, who, after all, invented Russian roulette. As the Germans now are, theRussians are afraid of them, and with good reason. \"It is now clear/' said theLondon Times in 1954, \"that neither Russia nor the West can agree to Germanunification on terms compatible with their national interests. The linch-pin ofWestern defense-West German cooperation—remains the hard core of Russian fears.And the main Western anxiety—Russian armies in the heart of Europe—is, in theRussian view, the indispensable condition of Soviet security. In the state ofthe world today, neither fear can be discounted as mere propaganda.\"In such a state of such a world, it might be that the United States of America,by seizing the initiative and proposing German reunification on other thannonnegotiable terms, would have to sacrifice its immediate national interest inorder to satisfy the Russians that their own interests would be served (or atleast not disserved) by agreement. If such a thing has never before been done—ifa nation has never sacrificed its immediate national interest in order toadvance that of another—it might be done for the first time in history on theUtopian basis that the relief of the Germans, at whatever sacrifice of immediatenational interest, would create the possibility of saving civilization.The cure of the Germans will not be free in any case, nor is it guaranteed byany prescription. If Germany is thought of—as it seems to be now, andmistakenly—as somebody's satellite, nobody will bother to do anything about itexcept to prepare it for war, including civil war. And war is not good for theGermans. Only if the interested great powersdecide that ultimate self-interest is more interesting than immediateself-interest will they be interested in relieving the Germans of pressure. Butit would not do at all to have the great powers undertake the relief themselves;the quick switch from exploitation disguised (unsuccessfully) as benevolence toa program of genuine benevolence would only mystify the Germans.After many, many years of thinking it over, and at very close range, Mr. McCloy,the retired United States High Commissioner for the Occupation of Germany, cameto the conclusion that it might have been helpful to have had neutrals sit onthe bench at Nuremberg in 1946. There were those who, in 1946, suggested aneutral tribunal at Nuremberg, but they were not listened to, and it is now toolate to listen to them. But it is not too late to listen to those who nowsuggest that neutrals sit on the border in Berlin.The disadvantages to the West—or to the United States— of finding a way toreunite Germany would be immense. A unified Germany, although it would beanti-Communist, would be Socialist, because four-fifths of the East Germans areSocial Democrats; and there are some Americans who do not like Socialism. Inaddition, the \"abandonment\" of Germany would mean loss of face for the UnitedStates, a prospect most obnoxious to Occidentals. Worst of all, it would meanthe surrender of the whole present policy of containment by force—at least inEurope—and the whole present ambition of liberation by subversion andinsurrection. It would mean that wherever and however Communist expansion wouldbe stopped—assuming that such things are stoppable by military means—it wouldnot be stopped by war on the Vistula, the Oder, the Elbe, or the Rhine. It wouldmean that Europe could not be \"held.\"But the alternative prospect of having to depend uponThe UncalcuJated Riskthe Germans to \"hold\" it is not attractive, either. The Germans have notbeen—and are not going to be, in the next six months or six years—transformedfrom first-class totali-tarians to first-class freemen. When we remember whatmost of them so recently and habitually were, or at least did, it seems hardlyworth the trouble, if the Germans must save us, to be saved from Communism.In this lugubrious circumstance, a circumstance in which any program of realrelief is, perhaps, so unrealistic as to be unworthy of consideration, thereare, nevertheless, a few things that the United States could at least avoiddoing without being accused of utopianism. On the eve of the German election of1953, a New York Times headline said, \"U.S. Scans Food Aid for East Germans.Weighs Plan To Ship Surplus Stocks To Help Adenauer and Embarrass Russians.\" Twoweeks later Dean Heinrich Griiber of the Berlin Protestant Cathedral told hiscongregation: \"When a charitable project is undertaken without the true spiritof love, the blessing turns into a curse. We will gladly cooperate with thosewho work to relieve hardship, provided only that they do so without mentalreservations and without devious intentions. But we refuse to co-operate withthose persons or powers who use works of charity to disguise their political andpropaganda warfare/'No nation gorged with unmarketable surpluses in a starving world will everrelieve another by exploiting the other's hunger for a couple of weeks to win anelection. And a nation which, as a matter of public policy, attempts to do soattempts to do what it shouldn't. Neither the New York Times headline nor DeanGriiber's sermon was broadcast by the \"Voice of America\"; it is not nearly sohard to find ways to take the pressure off the Germans as it is to want to.The story is told—apocryphal, we may hope—that a friendof John Dewe/s encountered him on the street one day long ago in wet windyweather, with his little boy. The boy was standing, rubberless, in a puddle ofwater, and Dewey was watching him from the shore. \"You'd better get that childout of that puddle/' said the friend, \"or he'll catch pneumonia.\" \"I know/' saidthe philosopher. \"I'm doing it as fast as I can. I'm trying to figure out a wayto get him to want to get out.\" It does not seem likely that the United StatesGovernment will take a chance on the Germans' catching pneumonia. It has theirhealth—not to say its own —to consider. If our government cannot, for reasons ofState, demonstrate democracy to the Germans, in the hope that the Germans willtake to it some day, private agencies may still try. There is no law, German orAmerican, to prevent the construction of, say, a Vereinigte-Staaten-Haus acrossthe street from every AmeriJca-Haus in Germany. There are plenty of vacant lots.Amerilca-Haus would advertise, FREE LECTURE, and Veieinigte-Staaten-Haus wouldadvertise, FREE DEBATE.Children misbehave under pressure. The greater the pressure, the worse themisbehavior. The affected child may be the quiet type, but one day he burns thewhole house down. If we are his parents, we may relieve him by ignoring hisminor depredations; by setting him a good example; and, if possible, by lovinghim. In so far as he recognizes the parental authority—but only in so far as hedoes so—he may be gently controlled. The Germans do not recognize our parentalauthority, however well behaved they may be, and the danger of acting on falseanalogy is considerable. What is more, their depredations are rarely minor, andit is not always easy to love them. But the cure is probably somewhat the same.At least, beating the Germans has had the same consequences as beating thechild.The UncaJculated RiskAmerica has a great name in Germany; it used lovingly to be called ''LittleGermany\" among the Germans, and every one of my ten Nazi friends had one or morerelatives, no further removed than second cousin or uncle, who had emigrated tothe United States. It may not be arrogant to assume that the Germans look to us,even now, for light. If they do, it would be nice if we Americans could manifestsome of the compassion that relieves the compulsive child. It appears that thebig things that ought to be done cannot, for reasons of State, be done, even ifthe failure to do them means the ruin of the State. It may be all the moreurgent, then, to do the little things; and St. Francis' words, \"I come to you inlittle things,\" may still be the clue to the cure of the Germans.But maybe nothing can be done for the Germans, in which case, whatever anyoneelse does, we should let them alone. The proposition that anybody can doanything about anybody else is absolutely indemonstrable. Doctors of the bodyabound, but there are no doctors of the soul, or psyche. A great psychoanalystonce pointed proudly to a former patient and said: \"He used to be the unhappiestrotter in town. Now he's the happiest.\" It may very well be impossible for onewhole people, except by their example, to help another whole people transformtheir character; and that may be why, until 1945, it was never attempted. But aone-tenth-of-one-per-cent chance is one-tenth of one per cent better than nochance at all. It is risky to let people alone. But it is riskier still to pressmy ten Nazi friends—and their seventy million countrymen—to re-embracemilitarist anti-Communism as a way of national life.AcknowledgmentsI am indebted to a very great many persons, none of whom may be charged with anyresponsibility for any of the things I have said in this book:My friends who thought I might learn a little something in Germany, especiallyRobert M.
