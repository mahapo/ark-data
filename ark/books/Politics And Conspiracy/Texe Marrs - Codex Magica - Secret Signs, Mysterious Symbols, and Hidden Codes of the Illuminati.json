Then absolutely mine, I'll have and bind you. The Devil, Faust Play by Goethe (1749-1832) They're everywhere. Cleverly disguised. On TV, imbedded in magazines, and lurking in powerful advertising. Sometimes they're subtle or subliminal, other times direct, provocative, and mind-bending in effect. Strange symbols, signs, charms, talismans, and handshakes that program and control our minds. Henry Makow, astute inventor and essayist, says that they are key components of the satanic conspiracy that now confronts us with maximum force and evil. \"This satanic conspiracy,\" Makow warns, \"succeeds only because people cannot believe something so colossal and monstrous actually exists.\" 1 The world is a contest for our souls. The people who are pushing products, violence, and sex are not operating on a random, 'whatever sells' basis. They have Masonic symbols in their logos. The top players are following an occult script designed to enslave us body and soul. They are building a gigantic prison based on their own mental hell. This is the New World Order; we are the inmates. 2 It is, in fact, \"satanic indoctrination,\" Makow emphasizes, and we are all locked into the prison classroom as this mental poison from hell is piped in to us 24 hours a day, seven days a week."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"10 CODEX MAGICA A Psychological Matrix In this eye-opening book, Codex Magica, you will discover just how accurate and true are the warnings of Mr. Makow and just a few others. Most people, of course, are so far gone, their minds so awash with occultism acquired from decades of propaganda encountered on every side, they cannot any longer decipher reality. The majority are caught in some form of Psychological Matrix. Tragically, hundreds of millions of people have, in a manner of speaking, become \"Manchurian Candidates.\" They eat, breathe, move, and sleep as if in a trance. Immobile, unable to react, afflicted with amnesia, they are like Pontius Pilate who, when confronted with Jesus Christ standing right in front of him, the very essence of unmovable Truth, asked Christ the question. \"What is truth?\" Well, here, in Codex Magica, in over 600 incredible pages, is truth. Here you will see pictures of many of the foremost movers and shakers of human history, ancient and modern, as they secretly communicate through sign and symbol. Naturally, the elite do not relish being exposed in their dirty works and evil doing. They and their dumbed-down minions —I am referring to the overwhelming \"see no evil, hear no evil\" masses of people in society—can be expected to quickly jump to the attack and attempt to deny it all. Through sleight-of-hand, they will do their utmost to divert your attention. \"The pictures are taken out of context,\" they will protest. \"The images are not what they seem.\" \"Here, listen to us,\" they will implore, \"it's not what it looks like. Let us explain it all to you.\" \"Don't be hasty now in your judgment,\" they'll cry. \"You and I know that conspiracies don't really exist. Everything is okay, nothing is amiss. It is all just an accident, nothing to fret about.\" \"Are You Going to Believe Your Lying Eyes?\" Their weak and idiotic protestations remind us of the famous TV comedian, Groucho Marx. Groucho enjoyed retelling the story of the time a startled wife came home to find her adulterous husband in bed with another woman. \"It's not what you think, \" he assured her. \"Are you going to believe what I tell you, or are you going to believe your lying eyes?\" Thank God we no longer have to believe what they, the Illuminati, and their lying accomplices in the media and government tell us. We can lay their propaganda aside and view the actual evidence through the prism of truth with our own eyes. This book is the result of over two decades of research. I believe it speaks for itself. The pictures, illustrations, and proofs contained in these pages do, in my opinion, document a monstrous conspiracy that surrounds and envelops us. It may well be that some, a few, of the photographs, are not what they appear to be. We all know that it is possible, for example, that photographers took shots of certain people as their hands, fingers, arms, and bodies were inadvertently in odd positions. A picture may be worth a thousand words, as the old Chinese proverb says, but even pictures can be deceiving. And so, I leave it all up to you to decide, dear reader. Do these proofs provide"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 11 evidence of these peoples' involvement in nefarious, Masonic, occultic, or magical activity or not? You be the judge. To help you make a decision, often included in the captions that accompany the photos and illustrations is commentary that helps one to better analyze the situation or scene that is pictured. When possible, I present evidence and information outlining the individual's membership in the Masonic Lodge, the Rosicrucian Order, or other globalist or occultic groups, secret societies, and organizations. This is done as an aid to your independent decision-making. Sometimes, I admit, it is difficult from the picture alone to ascertain whether a person, or persons, are displaying a Masonic or other sign, or to tell for sure that an occultic pose or scene is being portrayed. Again, the author does his best to offer up evidence, such as pages, excerpts, and descriptions of such signs and poses from official textbooks, dictionaries, and encyclopedias of the Masonic Order or illustrations and examples by experts and authorities. In some instances, it is unclear what exactly is transpiring in a photo because the intent, or motive, of the individual subject cannot be discerned. We cannot read peoples' minds, and so we must judge based on the photographic evidence. For example, there is much confusion today over the hand sign of the devil called \"El Diablo\" or \"Il Carnuto.\" Many confuse this sign of evil with the sign of the deaf for \"I love you\" and with the sign given by many to indicate youthful rebellion, sex, and rock and roll. In the section of Codex Magica that pictures a number of people giving this problematic sign, I therefore explain the difference in types of hand signs and discuss the ongoing controversy in an attempt to clear up some of the confusion. Readers may just find the clarifying information presented here revealing, to say the least. All in all you will view in Codex Magica over 1,000 photos and illustrations documenting Illuminists, Satanists, and other elitists practicing magic. Even if the skeptics and naysayers were able to explain away a few of these proofs, the remainder would be sufficient aplenty to prove the thesis of this book. That, indeed, a massive conspiratorial network of occult magicians exists today and has existed throughout human history. From the perspective of the occult researcher and investigator, the key to understanding the precarious world we live in is the recognition that a consistent pattern exists. A criminal is often convicted by an overwhelming preponderance of circumstantial evidence, even when no direct evidence — like a smoking gun—is produced. But in our case, in Codex Magica, we do produce a convincing array of direct evidence, along with many facts that connect the dots, to conclusively prove the continuing existence of an occult conspiracy. Over 600 pages of photographic evidence and materials cannot all be wrong. Exercising Fairness and Good Judgment I wish to emphasize that I accuse no one pictured herein of being a Satanist or occultist. Their being pictured here does not mean that individuals are necessarily members of the Order of the Illuminati or prove anything whatsoever about their social, political, religious ideology or other beliefs. Nor am I implying, suggesting,"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"12 CODEX MAGICA or stating that the men and women pictured are knowingly involved in any type of plot, satanic or otherwise. My friends are fully aware that over the years, I have authored and produced numerous books, audiotapes, and videos on the subject of mysterious marks, symbols, signs, and logos, including such bestseller classics as Dark Secrets of the New Age, Mystery Mark of the New Age, and Circle of Intrigue. As such, the reader should realize that the information in my books and other works is based solely on my own opinion. True, I do my level best to judge things accurately and to marshall relevant facts and data that might bear; but ultimately, the reader or viewer must decide if he or she concurs with the author's judgements and opinions. As the cliche of a well- known TV news network so often echoes, \"We report, you decide.\" Those who have read and evaluated my past works know that I am always concerned and desirous of presenting accurate information. I invite anyone who believes the facts and analysis, or even the opinions expressed herein are incorrect or incomplete to promptly inform me of such. I am more than willing to make corrections or retractions based on the best evidence. Deciphering A Mountain of Data One of the problems inherent in an undertaking so vast as this book is that the subject matter is so broad and complex. There are literally thousands of secret signs, grips, and symbols to consider in evaluating photographic evidence. My opponents—the men of the secret societies and the Illuminists—would agree that this is the case. In the Royal Arch Mason, an official publication of Freemasonry, Dr. William L. Cummings commented on how many hundreds of rites, rituals, and degrees existed. 3 Obviously, in each of the hundreds of ceremonies a number of secret handshakes and signs are taught and practiced. Thus, Cummings remarks, Masons themselves are in a state of confusion: It generally comes as a surprise and sometimes as a shock when the Mason who has never given any attention to the subject learns at least a hundred Masonic and quasi-Masonic rites and systems have existed and no less than eight hundred so- called Masonic degrees have been revised. 4 Royal Arch Mason editor Ray V. Denshaw wryly comments that a long-time Mason of reputation may be asked, \"How many of the hundreds of degrees have you received? Have you received the Rite of Memphis of 90 degrees? Or the Rectified Rite? Or the Swedenborgian Rite?\" 5 Moreover, Masons affiliated with the Grand Lodge of the Orient in Paris, the United Lodge in London, or the Grand Masonic Lodge of Israel, may well utilize signs and handshakes not used, seen, or understood in other orders. Then, of course, there is the Order of the Rosicrucians, the Order of the Trapezoid, The Priory of Sion, The Alta Vendita, the P2 Lodge, the Solar Order of the Temple, the modern-day Knights Templar, the Vatican's Knights of Malta and Knights of Columbus, the Order of the Odd Fellows, the Order of Ahepa, the Order"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 13 of Skull and Bones, the Bohemian Club, the Pilgrims Society, and a thousand or more other secret societies and orders, not to mention the many Jewish cabalistic groups, satanic churches, and witchcraft and druid sects. Knowledge of Secret Signs Opens Doors British Satanist Aleister Crowley, a man who fancied himself the \"wickedest man on the planet,\" was Grand Master of the Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.) and also founded the mysterious and Luciferian, Order of Astrum Argentinium. He once ruefully and knowingly intimated that after he had independently learned and practiced how to do the secret handshakes of a number of other secret societies and orders throughout Europe, he traveled around from city to city and discovered that by knowing how to convey the appropriate handshake, he was invited into what is normally the guarded inner sanctum of almost all the groups. They were persuaded simply by his handshake that Crowley was eligible to attend their conclaves and be made privy to their most closely guarded secrets. The average Mason or member of other secret orders knows little of the signs and symbols of his own order, let alone that of others.

Hands On Membership Not Required Illuminati paid provocateurs and other would-be critics might suggest that because you and I are not Masons or Illuminists, my research in Codex Magica— or your own independent research—has no authority. In answer, I am happy to respond by noting that the best of homicide detectives have never been murdered nor participated in such; few lifeguards have had an incident in which they were drowning and required assistance; most lawyers have never been sued; most psychiatrists have never been admitted as a patient to a mental institution; most neurosurgeons have never had brain surgery; most sports writers have never played pro-football or pro-baseball yet they report and comment on the same; most prison wardens have never themselves been locked up as convicts, and no historians have lived in the past centuries of history about which they amass information and facts and comment about. It doesn't take a monster to know that human monsters exist or a serial killer to know that murdering innocent people involves savage and evil acts. And there is abundant evidence that exists about the Illuminati and secret societies so that we do not have to join and participate in these repugnant groups to know what they are all about. Codex Magica proves that. A Challenge to Critics I hereby challenge any and all Masons and other members of secret societies to meet me on neutral ground with neutral observers in a contest, a duel of wits, if you will, to see who knows more about the subject matter presented in this book. Until such time as the critic accepts my challenge and is willing to publicly display that he knows as much or more about secret handshakes and grips, symbols, marks, logos and other occultic matters, I suggest that the critic shrink back to the shadowy confines of his Masonic Temple, synagogue, or shrine and refrain from empty, futile criticism. As for those skeptics and naysayers who get their kicks by pretending to know — just know! —that these things cannot be true, that \"conspiracies\" just do not exist and who maintain that anyone who even dares to mention the existence of any group called the \"Illuminati\" just has to be wrong, may I humbly recommend that they earnestly burn the midnight oil, carefully read this book, and examine the evidence in a fair-minded and objective manner? Many a friend has written telling the author that he likewise was once a doubter and skeptic, until, that is, he had heard and considered all the evidence.

It is said that Mozart's faithful dog followed dutifully behind the lonely funeral wagon.

So, I ask you, dear friend, once again: Do you dare to discover the secrets many have been punished for merely knowing, let alone revealing? Are you sure, very sure, you want to enter the Forbidden Zone? Immersed In Evil You see, we are surrounded by evil on every side—quite literally immersed in it— but the wicked and the deceivers want us to believe that evildoing is exceptional. From childhood we have been taught that evil and corruption are the province of the few, that most people are virtuous, honest, and good, that most of our politicians truly have our interests at heart, that the social system, with the exception of just a few deviants and criminal types, is basically sound. With such assurances, most people breathe a deep sigh of relief. \"Don't worry, be happy,\" said the words of a fun-time novelty song a decade ago. And most of us appreciate and agree with that sentiment. After all, it's not nice to be negative, to be a skeptic in the midst of a nation of wannabe happy faces. Unfortunately, the masses who believe this nonsense have been gulled and are destined to receive, very soon, a rude shock and an abrupt awakening. Grand Deception As Christopher Mark observed recently in an insight-filled article entitled \"Grand Deception: The Theft of America and the World,\" \"The world is completely corrupt beyond your wildest dreams, and the United States is, perhaps, the most gullible of all nations.\" 1 Mark goes on to explain: For now, grasp this: The world you believe exists does not exist. We live in a form of the Matrix, not unlike the world portrayed in John Carpenter's movie, \"They Live,\" except that high government officials and international bankers are the elite who control all you see and hear as did the aliens portrayed in the movie. 2 But, the foolish may object, we have the media to protect us from the corrupt. We cannot be deceived as long as there is a free press to act as our watchdog. Ah, but there's the rub. There is no free press! Christopher Mark adds: The news is a farce. As is the case with the financial institutions, which are"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"CAUTION! - YOU ARE ENTERING THE FORBIDDEN ZONE 17 concentrated in the hands of the few, long ago the media was bought and paid for...What you read and what you see on a daily basis is largely manufactured. You are being lied to each and every day. 3 Thomas Mann, the keen social observer and philosopher, once suggested that men are erroneously taught to believe that it is forbidden and wrong to expose the works of darkness, or to reveal the machinations of evildoers, especially evildoers who, though they act in hellish ways, the deceived world at large so obviously holds in the highest regard: That is the secret delight and security of hell, that it is not to be informed on, that it is protected from speech, that it just is, but cannot be made public in the newspaper, or be brought by any word to critical knowledge. 4 Secret Delight How interesting the realization that, as Thomas Mann puts it, hell takes \"secret delight\" in its ability to keep secrets. Proverbs 9:13-18 seems to have a relation to this. It states: A foolish woman sitteth in the high place of the city, To call passengers who go right on their ways: she saith to him, bread eaten in secret is pleasant. But he knoweth not that the dead are there; and that her guests are in the depths of hell. Why do the Illuminati value secrecy so highly? Why all the mysterious, encoded signs, handshakes, symbols, language, and codes? One finds many reasons. For one thing, the psychopath — these are the kind of people who are Illuminists — seems to be drawn to the darkness, to mysterious perversions and deep occultism. \"Nothing so arouses the deep mind's attention than the call of the dark, arcane and mysterious,\" Paul Huston writes in his book, Mastering Witchcraft. 5 Secrecy is deemed essential amongst witchcraft sects, and witchcraft is, in essence, Illuminism. Huson explains: \"Now witchcraft consists of knowledge, and knowledge brings power. Power shared is power lost. Although we have entered the Age of Aquarius, along with its attendant freedom and loosening of restrictions, it will still be very much in your interests as a witch to shroud certain of your doings in a reasonable veil of secrecy.\" 6 As you will discover in studying the pages of Codex Magica, the Illuminati certainly do have much to hide. Seeing as how the leaders of this notorious organization are responsible for hardship, bloodshed and revolutionary terror on a global scale, if their secrets were found out, there would be hell to pay. If the masses ever were to wake up from their trance and begin to understand just how horribly they have been deceived, they would angrily rise enmasse and string up the elite from the nearest light pole. The Most Terrible Secret of All But there's also the matter of the most terrible secret of all, the secret that, if"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"18 CODEX MAGICA discovered, would sound the death knell for the Illuminati and Freemasonry. Manly P. Hall, 33°, touched on this in his book, Lectures on Ancient Philosophy: Freemasonry is a fraternity within a Fraternity — an outer organization, concealing an inner brotherhood of the elect. The invisible society is a secret fraternity dedicated to a MYSTERIOUS SECRET. 7 As Hall alludes, Freemasonry hides its greatest secret even from its membership at large—only an invisible \"inner brotherhood\" is entrusted with it. Robert Guffey, writing in the book, The Conspiracy Reader, reports that the \"cryptocrats,\" as he calls the elite, consider most Americans to be mere sheep who must be kept from discovering \"the black cauldron of dirty secrets\" hidden to them. 8 The MYSTERIOUS SECRET of which Manly P. Hall, 33° writes, surely falls into this category of dirty secrets kept squirreled away in the black cauldron. The dirtiest secret found inside that black cauldron —THE MYSTERIOUS SECRET—is this: That the unknown \"God\" worshipped by the Masons and called by such hazy, nebulous names as the Great Architect of the Universe and by codenames such as Abaddon, Mahabone, and Jahbuhlun, is actually none other than Satan, or Lucifer. That is the greatest of secrets that the Illuminati must shield from view. The Illuminated (so-called \"enlightened\") man who knows this darkest of secrets is taught by his superiors and comes to believe that all who are in on the secret are somehow more sophisticated, urbane, intelligent, and spiritually astute, than the uncouth, vulgar, and coarse people who stupidly follow after the God of the Holy Bible. Stupid people deserve to be deceived, say the Masons and Illuminists. Thus, as Emile Grillot DeGivry comments, the elite \"conceal in order to baffle the vulgar.\" 9 Marie Roberts and Hugh Ormsby-Lennon, in Secret Texts: The Literature of Secret Societies, note that the rituals, rites, symbols, emblems, and other tools of the secret societies are \"Mysteries that must not be revealed to the profane, lewd, and unworthy.\" 10 How does it feel, dear reader, to realize that the wicked men of the Illuminati and of the Lodge and other secret societies consider you, me, and everyone outside their own special preserve, as \"profane, lewd, and unworthy?\" Symbols as Secrets To maintain their rotten and corrupt body of secrets, the Illuminati leaders and groups employ symbols. The rites, ceremonies, hand signs, and grips of the Illuminists are based on the science and art of symbolism. It is said that symbolism began as recorded in the Bible's book of Genesis when God put a \"mark\" or sign on Cain who had slain his brother, Abel. Throughout human history, marks, signs, pictures, and hieroglyphs came to be used to convey words, ideas, concepts, and secrets. \"By symbols,\" wrote Thomas Carlyle in Sartor Resartus, \"is man guided and commanded, made happy made wretched. He everywhere finds himself surrounded with symbols, recognized as such or not recognized.\" 11 As you'll discover in Codex Magica, the elite use many symbols and signs to hide and obfuscate their magical work and alchemy. In the Blue Lodge (the first three"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"CAUTION!-YOU ARE ENTERING THE FORBIDDEN ZONE 19 degrees), the initiate takes an oath of obligation, pledging: I will always hail, EVER CONCEAL, AND NEVER REVEAL, any of the arts, parts, or points of the hidden mysteries of Ancient Free Masonry... 12 The Order of the Eastern Star, the women's Masonic organization, informs its new members that the Order teaches them of their duties and obligations \"by means of SECRET SIGNS AND PASSWORDS.\" 13 The initiate is further instructed that she must bind herself \"to preserve the most sacred SECRECY respecting the work of the Order.\" 14 Symbols are more than just pictures. Consider: When you and I, as patriotic citizens, see the red, white, and blue flag of the U.S.A. waving aloft, many emotions are aroused in our minds and hearts. Memories sometimes gush forth, feelings of love of country, home, and family; perhaps deep appreciation for our country's founders, its Constitution, and for the soldiers and servicemen who have died to protect and keep us free. All this bound up in just one symbol. To the Masons and other Illuminists, their occult symbols also embody a deep and varied set of meanings. Alex Home, in Sources of Masonic Symbolism, distinguishes between a mere \"emblem\" and a \"symbol.\" An emblem is something that stands for something else, he says, while \"a symbol has a moral and spiritual meaning.\" 15 That \"moral and spiritual meaning\" is, of necessity, reserved as secret in nature by these corrupt cultists, because, if their secrets should be exposed to the light, their Great Work and Grand Plan would be vulnerable to destruction, as it should be. But kept secret, the symbols and signs of the Illuminati exert a strong force. Foster Bailey, 33°, in The Spirit of Freemasonry, explains: A symbol veils or hides a secret, and it is that which veils mysterious forces. These energies when released can have a potent effect. 16 To the man whose entire life is immersed in magical symbols, signs, and codes, and who has taken a solemn oath to maintain secrecy in fear of disclosure, the world takes on a supernatural, paranoid quality. Indeed, such men are schizophrenic in tendency, being torn between their role in the normal everyday world and their underground existence in the sordid world of their occult fraternity. Illuminists are, indeed, very dangerous men. Ancient Origins—Babylonian Now it is important to understand that almost all the symbols and signs of the elite are very ancient in origin. Former Scottish Rite Freemasonry Sovereign Grand Commander Henry C. Clausen, 33°, who was appointed in 1942 by President Roosevelt to head up the Commission to Investigate the Pearl Harbor Attack, writes that the footsteps of The Order go deep, and its symbols are thousands of years old. \"They arose in ancient ages,\" Clausen states, \"The signs, symbols, and inscriptions come to us from across long, drifting centuries and will be found in ancient Sumerian clay tablet libraries of the cities of Lir, Lagash, and others of the first"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"20 CODEX MAGICA true urban civilization. This, occurred about 600 years before Egypt was civilized...\" 17 In other words, Clausen is telling his Masonic readers that their signs and symbols came from Babylon. The Holy Bible warns that the Ancient Mystery Religion of wicked Babylon will bounce back into demonic prevalence in the last days (see Revelation 13, 17, and 18), and here we have the Sovereign Grand Commander, the international chieftain of the Masonic Lodge, informing us of the Babylonian origins of the secret symbols and signs of his Illuminist Order. When we realize that, for the elite, their symbols are claimed to be infused with dynamic life—to be real things, active images that make and testify and create, we begin to comprehend the powerful and explosive meaning with which the Illuminati endow their signs and symbols. To them, these are not just geometric shapes, architectural patterns, lines, and circles. Their signs and symbols both live and possess creative power. They are archetypes and thoughtforms. In sum, they are real things that perform. One is reminded, therefore, of the \"image of the beast\" which, in the last days, is prophesied to both move about and to speak (Revelation 13). Pity the Poor, Hoodwinked Mason It's bad enough that the elite hide their dirty little (and big) secrets behind such smoke screens as secret hand signs, codes, etc. But what is remarkably obscene is that they hoodwink their own people. The highest levels of the Freemasons, for example, have a special word for the manner in which they seek to deceive and mislead not only the \"profane\" (you and me!) but the vast majority of fellow Masons. That word is hoodwink. It is defined as the effort put forth by the lying men at the top echelons to keep lower-level members in darkness. In the Encyclopedia of Freemasonry, editor Dr. Albert Mackey, 33°, a former Sovereign Grand Commander, claims that secrecy, silence, and deceit—in other words, hoodwink, is an absolute necessity so that, \"the mysteries of our art should be preserved.\" 18 Helena Blavatsky, co-Mason and founder of Theosophy, was unusually candid when she once remarked, \"What is one to do, when in order to rule men, it is necessary to deceive them?...For almost invariably the more simple, the more silly, and the more gross the phenomenon, the more likely it is to succeed.\" 19 Listen to the admission of Albert Pike, former Sovereign Grand Commander who Masonic historian Manley P. Hall, 33°, magnificently praised as a \"Masonic Prometheus...a king among men by the divine right of merit:\" Masonry, like all the Religions, all the Mysteries, Hermeticism, and Alchemy, conceals its secrets from all except the Adepts and Sages, or the Elect, and uses false explanations and misinterpretations of its symbols to mislead those who deserve only to be misled; to conceal the Truth, which it calls Light, from them, and to draw them away from it. 20"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"CAUTION! - YOU ARE ENTERING THE FORBIDDEN ZONE 21 What impudence! What arrogance! Pike is letting us in on the deceit. Even if a man is a Mason, he may not be adjudged worthy of being promoted as one of the \"Adepts and Sages, or the Elect.\" In that case, along with non- Masons, he is purposely misled by \"false explanations and misinterpretations.\" And according to Pike, he deserves to be misled. Secret Doctrine Withheld George Steinmetz, yet another Masonic author, notes, \"There is a SECRET DOCTRINE in Freemasonry! That secret doctrine is concealed, rather than revealed by the very lectures which, we (Masons) are told, offer a rational explanation of the ceremonies of initiation.\" 21 Oh my! So the poor Masons must sit and listen to a bunch of boring lectures, with superiors rattling on and on about what are described as the \"Mysteries,\" when, really, it's all just malarkey because the true explanations —the SECRET DOCTRINE —is concealed to all except the few favored \"Adepts.\" This is why, when I interview lower-level Masonic friends of mine who are more than happy to privately confide to me all the \"secrets\" they have learned, I often find that almost everything they think they know is pure junk. The hard facts—the really useful info —is reserved for the Masonic muckety-mucks, though it may be discovered with diligent investigation by others, too, no matter how much the Masonic order vainly attempts to conceal and deny. As Albert Pike relates, \"What is most worth knowing in Masonry is never very openly taught. The symbols are displayed, but they are mute. It is by hints only... that the initiate is put upon the track of the hidden secret.\" 22 How does one finally discover the inner secrets of Freemasonry? My own experience provides the answer. It has taken me many years of meticulous research and study of the Ancient Mystery Religions of Babylon, Sumeria, Greece, Rome, China, etc. I have spent many nights reading old textbooks and treatises on medieval and occult subjects; conducted intensive investigation of the rituals and symbols of scores of secret societies and orders; and spent years examining the true teachings and practices of New Ageism, witchcraft and Satanism. Moreover, without study of the Holy Bible and constant referral back to it, much of the knowledge I have acquired could not be properly understood. Masonic expert Lynn F. Perkins alludes to the gigantic amount of extracurricular research and work needed to uncover the greatest secrets of the Masonic Fraternity. He writes: The true wisdom is concealed and hidden, not only from those who do not join the Masonic Order but also from those who \"take\" the degrees; and it will remain Hoodwinked! Pity the poor, foolish man who becomes a Freemason! In the very first degree ritual, that of Entered Apprentice, a blindfold is put over his eyes, and a cable-tow is hung around his neck. Symbolically, the dumb candidate is \"HOODWINKED.\" Little does he know that his superiors intentionally set out to deceive the candidate and they contrive their deceit through all the ritual degrees up to and including the 33rd."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"22 CODEX MAGICA hidden until each Mason seeks revelation and finds the Truth for himself. There are no interpretations in the Ritual; they have to be sought elsewhere.\" 23 Pike, echoing Steinmetz, Hall, Perkins and all the other high-level Masonic authorities, goes so far as to mock and disparage lower-level Masons, especially those who have earned only the first three degrees (\"the Blue degrees\"). After acknowledging that the lower-level brethren are \"intentionally misled,\" he goes on to say that it is not intended that the initiate understand the symbols and deepest secrets of the Order, but worse, the Masonic Lodge's rituals and lectures are designed so that the lower-level Masons shall imagine he does understand them! It is only at a later time, as he has moved up the ladder of degrees, that the purposely dumbed- down Mason discovers he's been had, that he's been played for a fool. In other words, he's been hoodwinked! So, in effect, Masons are lied to, tricked, made fun of, and intentionally led astray, with only a little knowledge added to their brain reservoirs as they advance up the chain. Meanwhile, the poor, pitiful souls imagine they are really in on all the super- duper secrets of the Craft. Their Masonic superiors play them all for suckers. P.T. Barnum, of Ringling Brothers, Barnum & Bailey Circus fame, surely was right when he exclaimed, \"There's a sucker born every minute.\" To which yours truly, author of Codex Magica, might add: \"...and a 32nd or 33rd degree Mason is behind the veil laughing his head off and rolling in the aisle every time a new sucker is initiated into the 1st degree of Freemasonry.\" Shining Light on the Darkness The Brotherhood of Darkness, as a good friend of mine, Dr. Stanley Monteith, calls the Illuminati, is quite confident it can easily maintain the highest level of secrecy regarding the actual meaning and import of its signs and symbols. Its leaders believe they can even afford to communicate these signals and messages in plain sight, sure in the knowledge that the trance-like masses are incapable of recognizing the awful, ongoing masquerade of deception that stares them right in the face. Martin Short, who authored a book, Inside the Brotherhood, exposing the Masonic Order inside Great Britain, observed that Masons, believing their secrets to be oblivious to detection, are known to mutter words of near-contempt as they sing a little ditty called \"The Entered Apprentice's Song.\" A verse of this melody goes: The world is in pain, Our secrets to gain. And still let them wonder and gaze on; They ne'er can divine, the Word or the Sign Of a Free and Accepted Mason 24 Oh, we can't, can we? Perhaps it is true that the uninformed \"world\" at large cannot divine the Word and Sign of the Mason, but the readers of Codex Magica shall do exactly that. Let us therefore move forward with eager anticipation as we uncover in this book many of the most precious and despicable secrets of the elite —things they never in a million years thought we would discover."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"CAUTION!-YOU ARE ENTERING THE FORBIDDEN ZONE 23 Lives of Quiet Desperation... and Torment Why have the Illuminists succeeded in their hoodwinking efforts up to now? Is it not because of the gullibility of the general public? It has been said that, \"most men lead lives of quiet desperation.\" This is true, and so it is that in their silent morass of desperation, most seek to dull their senses through alcohol, drugs, sex, and entertainment. Tormented within, but doing their utmost to keep a smile on their faces, unable to face the truth, too frightened to even admit to themselves that anything is awry, most men do not even know who their tormentors really are. To escape reality, these men shrink from the facts, hoping against hope that all will turn out satisfactory in the end. The reality that a monstrous conspiracy exists against them and against their loved ones becomes an enormous burden they simply cannot bear. Cowards, it seems, die a thousand deaths. Swedish researcher Juri Lina, whose book, Architects of Deception, is a revealing, fact-filled expose of the secret society of Freemasonry, warns that the ideology of \"Illuminism,\" propagated by international Freemasonry and other secret elite groups, is an overwhelming, hidden danger to all of us. It has already brought the most violent upheavals and revolutions and is responsible for the \"moral and spiritual degeneration of the individual.\" 25 Yet astonishingly, writes Lina, most men and women are hopelessly oblivious to the very forces that most affect their lives on a daily and continuing basis. Lina consequently puts forth this word of caution: Those who do not examine the different aspects of the conspiracy will remain incapable of understanding the world...Our rulers want us to believe that a lack of historical knowledge and ignorance about the secrets of nature constitutes true knowledge. 26 Lina laments the rampant ignorance by the masses who possess little or no understanding of the vast evil on their very doorstep about to break down the door and enter therein. Wisely, he contends that the ignorant, while not the inventors of evil things, nevertheless are accomplices and contributors to evil. \"Not being aware of these facts,\" he writes, \"is in itself an evil because ignorance serves evil.\" 27 \"The little Man Who Wasn't There\" Dr. Peter Ruckman, author of many fine books exposing the conspiracy and defending the Bible, in his newsletter recently penned an article about \"The Little Man Who Wasn't There.\" 28 Ruckman sagely observed that historians, like other establishment \"experts,\" can scarcely be trusted, for they invariably write a history they would like to believe. They limit themselves to reporting only that which comports and agrees with the socially accepted view of history and \"truth.\" If a set of facts is unpleasant or inconvenient to the officially approved mantra, or version, of events, reality must suffer. Facts must become non-facts and lies must be converted into \"reliable truths.\" Ruckman remarks:"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"24 CODEX MAGICA When I was a boy we repeated several little doggerels that turned out to be gems of wisdom in content. One went: \"Last night I saw upon the stair a little man who wasn't there; he wasn't there again today; oh gee, I wish he'd go away! 29 \"Some nonexistent spooks,\" Ruckman adds, \"are very persistent.\" 30 In Codex Magica, we shine a bright spotlight on the little man sitting on the stair, and — voila! — we discover the incontrovertible fact that he is not only there, he is not a little man at all. He's a giant, dark, wicked, corrupt, conspiring, sly, cunning, devious, dangerous ogre who fully deserves all the contemptible attention we can focus on him. He's more than a spook, he's a bloodsucking parasite, a monster who is sitting on the stair blocking us from entering, a criminal thug lying in wait to waylay you and me and rob us of our belongings, our health, our very lives. Without him sitting there detrimentally blocking our path, the world would be a far better place. Certainly a safer and happier place. \"Two Plus Two Make Four\" Bob Whitaker, a South Carolinian who has done many fine and adventurous things in his life, teaching college classes, serving as a senior staffer on Capitol Hill, and writing copy for the Voice of America radio broadcast, points out that anyone today who simply believes the obvious is ignorantly and unfairly branded an extremist, a conspiracy-monger, a racist, or worse. Men are not free, Whitaker suggests, to tell the truth: In George Orwell's book 1984, it turns out that the whole hideous totalitarianism that crushed the hero is based on ending one simple, useless-sounding freedom; \"Freedom,\" it says, \"is the freedom to say that two plus two make four.\" 31 How incredible! Whitaker is right on target. Who would have ever thought that in the once great United States of America would reside almost 300 million souls, virtually every one of whom today is shaking in his boots, quivering, numb with fear over what dreadful things might happen if he just once simply put his foot down, gritted his teeth, and spit out the words: I see the little man on the stair. He is there! And two plus two makes four. And that's all there is to it. Period! How sad that most men, by their cowardly silence, become secret collaborators, acquiescing in their own enslavement. What a marvelous and wonderful world this would be if just a small group of honest and thoughtful, courageous men and women would view the revealing and provocative photographs, illustrations, and proofs in Codex Magica and exclaim with all their might in a loud, loud voice to all within hearing range: \"I see it. I no longer will remain bound by the willful ignorance that binds the multitudes. I will tell others. I will speak out until, someday, maybe soon, the whole, rotten occult Illuminati establishment comes crashing down!\""},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"TWO The Megalomania and Rage of the Psychopaths—Why the Illuminati Do What They Do All of my means are rational, only my ends are insane. — \"Captain Ahab\" in Moby Dick by Herman Melville Why do the Illuminati do what they do? After many years of research and investigation into their behavior and conduct, and under- standing their goals and ambition, I am persuaded these men fit the definition of psychopathic personalities. They are psychopaths and as such they are afflicted with the dangerous malady called megalomania. Here is how Webster's Dictionary defines these words: Psychopathic personality: 1. An emotionally and behaviorally disordered state characterized by clear perception of reality except in the individual's social and moral obligations and often by the pursuit of immediate personal gratification in criminal acts, drug addiction, or sexual perversion. 2. A person having a psychopathic personality. Megalomania: 1. A mania for great or grandiose performance. 2. A delusional mental disorder that is marked by infantile feelings of personal omnipotence and grandeur."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"26 CODEX MAGICA In sum, the psychopath possesses a clear perception of reality —he knows full well what he's doing —but he refuses to abide by society's morals. Instead, he pursues personal gratification in such things as criminal acts, drug addiction and sexual perversion. Combined with feelings of megalomania, the psychopath has visions of his own omnipotence—he thinks he is a god —and has delusions of grandeur. Since he is persuaded he is divine and not bound by the rules that apply to other, less godly beings, the psychopath is a dangerous person, indeed. Dr. Essi Viding, of the Institute of Psychiatry at the prestigious King's College in London, England, has done extensive study of the motivation and behavior of the psychopathic personality. Dr. Viding cautions that the psychopath \"shows a lack of remorse, conscience, and understanding of the feelings of others.\" 1 Sounds like a psychological description and profile of a lot of our world's foremost political and corporate leaders today, doesn't it? Insane, Parasitic, Immoral, and Dangerous Frustrate the unbridled ambition of the psychopath and he strikes out in a controlled, yet insane, fit of anger and rage. If the psychopath holds a position of great responsibility — say, President of the United States or dictator of a technologically advanced nation, he can do some major damage. William Krasner, in an article way back in 1946 entitled Neurotica, warned of the dangers that lie ahead for societies who fall into the grip of the criminal psychopath. He wrote: The psychopath is a disruptive, parasitic, immoral influence. Any group, while it may for various reasons support and even honor the psychopath... in direct propor- tion to the extent that the psychopath is tolerated, that his attitudes find support in the culture pattern, to that extent it is an unhealthy society. 2 Tragically, America has actually become a dangerous haven for mentally disordered psychopaths. The Council on Foreign Relations, an Illuminist organization, whose 3,000 members run almost every facet of our federal government, especially at the highest official level, is no doubt populated by a majority of psychopaths. The Masonic Order in the U.S.A. has some two million initiates who have voluntarily undergone occultic-laced rituals to be accepted as common brethren. The ranks of the Masonic Order are loaded, I believe, with dangerous psychopaths. The United Nations organization, endorsed and funded by our Congress, is a seething cesspool of unrepentant psychopaths. Liars and Deceivers Psychopaths are inveterate liars and deceivers. In fact, they lie on an Orwellian scale. If confronted with a situation in which veracity and truth are prerequisite, the men who run America's federal government or who sit as CEOs of this nation's top financial institutions and corporations, have the psychopathic \"talent\" of looking the"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"THE MEGALOMANIA AND RAGE OF THE PSYCHOPATHS 27 citizenry square in the face and insisting that, \"two plus two do not make four.\" Being deceivers and practitioners of the Craft (witchcraft), the psychopaths who lead the inner circle of the Illuminati are more than capable of standing before the cameras and working magic and occult ritual right before our very eyes, pretending all the while they are simply acting normal as usual. It has been said that if one really wants to hide a great secret, he should conceal it in plain sight. Well, this maxim certainly applies to the disordered, but somehow illogical, behavior of the men of the Illuminati. It is not rational to do what these men do in public, in plain sight, yet they do it and expect to get away with it. And they do get away with it! Or at least, they did, before this book was published revealing their unseemly, scripted, ritual behavior. Why all the occultic ritual rigmarole? Why do some of the world's richest and influential men take the risks they do in working their demonic magical acts in plain sight, so that they are pictured doing it in major newsmagazines and newspapers, on television, and in other avenues with huge potential audiences? Edgar Allen Poe, the famous novelist of dark mood and mysterious suspense, once wrote a tale, \"Perverse of the Imp,\" in which he suggested that criminals often have an overwhelming, all consuming desire to publicly confess their devious crimes. Could it be this is why the Illuminati so flagrantly flaunt their occultic wares? Is it that they possess a unique taste for deceit and chicanery? Or is the performance in plain sight accomplished because it is believed to infuse power and mastery into their sought for aims and goals? Mockers and Tricksters Do they simply enjoy mocking and tricking us? Teasing and playing with our minds, realizing that the vast majority of people in society are willing dupes? It was, after all, serial killer John Wayne Gacy—certainly a psychopathic personality — who once bragged, \"A clown could get away with murder.\" Gacy, you see, enjoyed dressing up as a mischievous and gleeful clown and visiting hospital wards to cheer up young male patients. He also took great pleasure, in the confines of his home, in torturing and killing young boys. All of these are reasons why psychopaths of the Illuminati pose and parade occultly in front of cameras, exchange ritual handshakes, and otherwise taunt the public. Remember, according to Webster's, the psychopath is immoral, selfishly flaunts societal mores, is infantile in personality, is delusional, and has feelings of grandeur and omnipotence. Men who think they are omnipotent gods must take extreme delight in putting things over the masses whom they consider inferior and sub-human. Twelve Keys to Understanding Moreover, after long and careful consideration I propose that in addition to these factors, there are at least twelve other reasons, or factors, why the Illuminati persist in their seemingly delusional and infantile behavior. Each of the twelve reasons is represented by one of the key words listed below:"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"28 CODEX MAGICA • Secrecy • Magic • Build • Power • Pride • Elitism • Signal • Wealth • Please • Invocation • Encourage • Rebellion It is important we examine these twelve keys to understanding why the Illuminati do what they do. We have already covered the topic of the elite's obsession with Secrecy in Chapter One. In the following sections and pages of this present chapter, we will look at the remaining 12 keys. We begin with the Illuminati's employment of Magic to accomplish their ends. • MAGIC Magic is defined in The New Encyclopedia Brittanica as \"ritual performance or activity believed to influence human or natural events through access to an external mystical force beyond the ordinary human sphere.\" 3 This is an exceptionally accurate description of what magic is and reveals to us exactly why the Illuminati consider magic of such extraordinary importance in the accomplishment of their aims. That magic is an occult activity is also indicated in The New Encyclopedia Brittanica. So we are not talking here about magicians playing parlor tricks or entertainment extravaganzas—pulling rabbits out of hats, sawing beautiful girls in half, being chained in an aquarium full of water and escaping, etc. Instead, as the encyclopedia so well puts it, magic is ritual performance. It is an occult ritual. In this occult ritual, the \"magician,\" the Illuminist, believes he can \"influence human or natural events.\" So in Codex Magica, we see pictured the Illuminati giving secret signs, sharing concealed grips and handshakes, displaying symbols and communicating hidden messages. We realize that in performing these magical works, the Illuminist actually believes he is influencing human behavior or otherwise causing real events to occur in a particular, planned way or intended manner. Magic happens! is a popular slogan among witches, occultists, and Illuminists—things change, reality is transformed. Alchemical transformation occurs. Society is shaped by occult plan. However, to accomplish these aims, this shaping of society, the Illuminist, as an occult practitioner, fully understands that he is accessing, as the encyclopedia definition explains \"an external mystical force beyond the ordinary human sphere.\" Now, the Illuminist may imagine that he is merely accessing the \"cosmic energy force\" or that he is tapping into a \"fourth dimension,\" or the \"ethereal atmosphere.\""},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"THE MEGALOMANIA AND RAGE OF THE PSYCHOPATHS 29 Thus he may well lay claim that his magical work, or activity, is benign—that it is simply white magic, good magic, the right-handed path as the Satanists and other occultist call it. But as we shall see, the highest authorities in the occult world admit that there is no essential difference between white magic and black magic (the supposedly bad, evil, left-handed path). Magic is magic. Who, or what, then, is the Illuminist accessing in his ritual performance of magic? From my many years of research and investigation into the works and plans of the Illuminati, witches, Satanists, shamans, masons, and other occultists, I declare without hesitation that what these men are doing—knowingly in some cases, unwittingly in others, is calling on, that is invoking devils from an invisible realm (\"beyond the ordinary human sphere\"). The occult and the Masonic communities can call these evil presences by any coverup name they wish—the Great White Brotherhood, Shamballa, planetary entities, the Hierarchy, etc., but, in fact, the working of magic, I am convinced, is nothing less than the invocation, or inviting, of devils. This, indeed, is a very dangerous activity; yet the Illuminati has designed its many rituals, signs, codes, symbols, architecture, art, and other devices so that the world around us has become a veritable Grand Theater of the Occult. Because of the Illuminati, the whole world is enchanted, dark with supernaturalism, and the one the Holy Bible calls the Prince of the Power of the Air, also referred to as Satan and Lucifer, must be very proud of his human minions. • BUILD You will find pictured in Codex Magica a variety of different types of people. There are the celebrities and the rich and famous, the glitzy or jet-set people who are into Illuminism, occultism, and witchcraft because it is trendy and fashionable. Among this group are some who are into the Jewish Cabala —movie and Broadway stars, singer/entertainers, activists, and so forth. These are often ignorant people who are used by the Illuminati to extract money, for sex, and as novelties. When the money runs out, they grow too old for use as sex partners, or the novelty wears out, they are often cast out or retired and no longer have access to the \"Inner Circle\" of the Elite. Then there are the do-gooders — people who support revolution and the socialistic, globalist, environmentalist, and similar aims of the Illuminati for what they fancy is the good of society. Sometimes these people sign up for Cabala classes taught by rabbis; they eagerly join liberal social issue organizations and may also be involved in the secret societies and orders, though at a lower level. Again, we see these people are mere dupes. Finally, we see several strata of Illuminati elite —major politicians and bureaucrats, including Presidents, Prime Ministers, Chancellors, etc., as well as some corporate CEOs, financiers, media moguls, and others. These are major players, but again, they are dupes because there is a secret, invisible, arcane or hidden \"Inner Circle\" which works behind the scenes and tells these major players what to do. This higher level of the Illuminati elite have historically thought of themselves as"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"30 CODEX MAGICA The Builders. There is even a classic Masonic textbook by this very title. The Builders believe that Jehovah God did Adam and Eve a disservice by driving them out of the Garden. They rankle at the fact that Nimrod, the King of Babylon, was confounded in building the Tower of Babel, and they are seized with rage over the destruction of their Temple in Jerusalem. Indeed, the Builders are angered that every time they have sought to bring the world together as One, they have been thwarted by God. All of their chosen disciples, the Caesars, Charlemagne, Napoleon, Hitler, Stalin, FDR, Mao, saw their grand plan of conquest go down to resounding defeat. But still, they strive to complete their assigned mission. Now it is the New World Order (or Bush's \"democracy for all nations\") they have in mind. The United Nations is to be \"reformed,\" that is —strengthened. The few rogue nations that remain must be dealt with. The economies of all the nations must be equalized, enterprise extinguished, constitutions amended or ignored, private property seized or regulated severely, religions transformed, etc. Those are the goals. In other words, to build their New World Order, the elite intend to destroy the existing World Order. The old must go to make way for the new. It is the Hegelian Dialectical Process that is being used to achieve this prime objective. What is above must become what is below states the Illuminist law of alchemical transmutations. J. Robert Oppenheimer, the Soviet spy who oversaw the Manhattan Project, the building of the first atomic bomb, and was present when the humongous mushroom cloud rose with its imploding plumes of fire, is said to have exclaimed, \"I am became the destroyer of worlds.\" Few realized that this is a quote right out of the Hindu scriptures, the \"Bhagavad Gita, and it was supposedly from the Hindu sun god, Krishna. Oppenheimer, a Jew, appointed to his august scientific position by 33rd degree Mason, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, was deep into the occult and was a cabalist magician. As Michael Hoffman II and a few other keen-minded observers have pointed out, the A-bomb project, the transmutation of matter into intense forms of energy, was long an alchemical objective of the Illuminati magicians. Like the Hindu god who represents them, it is the fondest desire of these wicked, nihilistic men that they become the destroyer of worlds. 4 And then, from the burned out carcass, like the Phoenix rising from the ashes, is to come the New City of Glory, the Kingdom of the Illuminati, ruled by their god- man King and His Master, Satan. This is the ultimate, all-consuming, repugnant goal of The Builders, to undo what God has done, to defile and utterly destroy planet earth and to rebuild it in their image. The prophetic Scriptures tell us that this grandiose Plan — the Great Work of the Illuminati —will never fully come to fruition. The Kingdom shall not become the province of the rebellious Illuminati and their dark, occult master, Satan. Here is Almighty God's glorious declaration of how it all shall end: \"And the seventh angel sounded: and there were great voices in heaven, saying, THE KINGDOMS OF THE WORLD ARE BECOME THE KINGDOMS OF OUR LORD, AND OF HIS CHRIST, AND HE SHALL REIGN FOREVER AND EVER..."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"THE MEGALOMANIA AND RAGE OF THE PSYCHOPATHS 31 And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come, and the time of the dead, that they shouldest he judged, and that thou shouldest give reward unto thy servants the prophets, and to the saints, and them that fear thy name, small and great; and shouldest destroy them which destroy the earth.\" - recorded in Revelation 11:15, 18 God's incomparable will and plan shall prevail. His Christ and His people shall reign triumphant forever, and the evil shall be judged. And what of the Illuminati, the destroyers of the earth, the ones whom Satan's servant, Oppenheimer, trumpeted were the \"destroyer of worlds?\" The Scriptures give testimony to their fate; they too, shall be judged, so that God \"shouldest destroy them which destroy the earth.\" • POWER The hunger for power motivates the human disciples in the Illuminati structure. Because they serve Satan, they instinctually know they are also serving the will of his human hierarchy. They expect to be rewarded for this service to the evil side. George Bernard Shaw, who maintained an overwhelming hatred for God and for Christianity, wrote of a \"will\" incarnated in higher consciousness man (the elite) that shall \"finally mould chaos itself into a race of gods.\" 5 To fancy yourself as in a state of becoming divine, as so superhuman, special and superior you shall achieve elevation as one of a \"race of gods,\" is an intoxicating prospect. \"Do As Thou Wilt\" The Bible says of the Antichrist, he \"shall do according to his will\" (Daniel 11:36). Aleister Crowley, head of the occultic order, Ordo Templi Orientis, prided himself on being the \"wickedest man on earth.\" Crowley preached that Satanists had only one commandment: \"Do as thou wilt shall be the whole of the law.\" Only gods can do as they will. That translates into awesome power. Changing reality by the force of one's will is, in fact, the very essence of magic and witchcraft. F. Aster Barnwell, in his sinister book, The Meaning of Christ For Our Age, equates superior human will with god-consciousness. Through development and exercise of will, or magic, says Barnwell, a man may live forever as a god. Illumined by occult knowledge, the person is able to utilize pent-up psychic energy forces to effect material reality. Barnwell refers to this psychic energy force by the Hindu term \"Kundalini,\" or \"serpent power.\" 6 A man possessing serpent power is said to operate in a spiritual realm. As such, he is immune to and beyond any human spectrum of morality. Whatever he wills is good, based solely on the results and not on any relative moral scale. In essence, the ends justify the means. In such a relativistic theology, black magic is no lesser in moral standing than is white magic. Black is white, bad is good, and all things are reversed. Power is the Ultimate Aphrodisiac Oh, how thrilling to the egomaniacal Illuminati is the realization that they possess"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"32 CODEX MAGICA and wield such awesome power within the planetary realm. Power is addictive. Former Secretary of State and Illuminati insider extraordinaire Henry Kissinger once smiled and confided, \"Power is the ultimate aphrodisiac.\" To communicate ultra secret, coded, visual messages of an evil and conspiratorial nature to each other or to the whole group by way of the world's most influential media, with no fear of being reprimanded or of ever being punished for the crime must, indeed, be akin to ingesting a mind-altering, soul-satisfying aphrodisiac. These men lust for power, and conveying secret messages unintelligible to the ignorant masses must give them great emotional delight. It inspires in them the desire to accomplish even greater occult aims. As Shakespeare once wrote, \"The world is mine oyster which I, with sword, shall take and plunder. \" Yes, the world is their \"oyster,\" and some in the Illuminati hierarchy are so infused with the carnal ambition and lust to power they even seek to conquer and reign the starry realm beyond the surly bounds of this planet. It was British colonialist plotter Cecil Rhodes who once declared, \"I would annex the planets if I could.\" Somewhat less grand and pretentious in his ambition for power but nevertheless worth recalling is former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, so full of himself sitting at the top of the heap in the U.S. Congress that he once told an audience: \"My goal is to shift the entire planet. And I'm doing it!\" 7 • PRIDE A perverse sense of false pride is a major factor that motivates men to be active as Illuminati operatives and to communicate by secret handshakes, signs, and by other occult media. To smugly conceive of oneself as superior in enlightenment, in class status, in social connections, and in other artificial aspects is common to the elite. The promotion upward of the initiate degree-by-degree is purposely designed to create the impression that he is gaining knowledge forbidden to the unenlightened multitudes outside the order. A system of awards, jewels to be worn, covert handshakes and cryptic signs shared also reinforces the ideology that the individual is special and superior. To Be In On the Joke To be pictured in a nationally circulated magazine is ego-building enough for the Illuminist. But to identify with members of an exclusive and powerful secret organization by purposely giving a secret hand sign in that picture and realize that only other elite are \"in\" on the joke, so to speak—that can, indeed, engender a rush of perverse satisfaction and haughty pride. The attitude is, \"Ha! Aren't we pulling one over on them! What control we have over the masses. What swill they can be made to swallow!\" Jim Keith, a first-class conspiracy researcher who some believe was murdered by the elite during what was supposed to have been a minor surgical procedure on his knee, believed that the perverse satisfaction and exaggerated pride of these men is a"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"THE MEGALOMANIA AND RAGE OF THE PSYCHOPATHS 33 natural outgrowth of their keenly observing how much control over others their elite status confers on them and their associates. This is especially true given the Illuminati's control and manipulation of nations like the U.S.A., Russia and Germany, nations with vast technological prowess that fosters the growth of Big Brother government control. He writes: Beneath the cloak of the prime conspirators are larger groups of rich peasantry and landlords dominating a huge mass of poor serfs and less-than-serfs whose labor and lives are sucked to provide the lifeblood to nourish the upper portions of the pyramid. This ancient structure is perfectly visible to anyone with the eyes to be appalled. It is also obvious that the ruling class cabals and spy organizations which we do know about are pointed in roughly the same direction: the total control and \"utilization\" of the mass of mankind by whatever means it takes. Aside from all the lofty banter about the \"perfecting of mankind,\" what is desired is the perfecting of the systems of control. Control is the shared goal of these numerous conspiring individuals, groups, and governments, and in that sense they work together, collaborating here, working individually there, creating an evolving noose of murderous technological expertise that swiftly tightens around humanity's throat. With this goal in place, with money and the tools of advanced technology in hand, the overall program of accomplishment crystallizes. 8 Absolute Power Corrupts Absolutely Exaggerated, self-absorbed pride becomes especially evil and dangerous when prideful men acquire power. It was Lord Acton who, in 1886, uttered the well-known maxim that, \"power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.\" Unduly prideful men are imbued with that unrighteous temperament because they often have unfettered access to power—power over people, over organizations, over resources, and over nations. Power to reward or to punish chosen disciples, friends, or enemies, even power to take life. The best of historians now admit, for example, that President Franklin D. Roosevelt and his corrupt, Masonic associates knew in advance of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor that catapulted the United States into war. The Illuminati wanted world war, and the American airmen, soldiers, and sailors who died on December 7, 1941 were considered necessary to precipitate the USA's entrance into World War II. The U.S. Government also had prior knowledge of both the 1993 Oklahoma City bombing of the Murrah Federal Building and the 9/11 bombing attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon. The massive loss of life was no obstacle as far as the elite were concerned. Their cold-blooded agenda is calculated to engender chaos and destruction in a never-ending, alchemical process of bringing Ordo ab Chao (order out of chaos). To the elite, murder is business as usual. And so, once again, we discover"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"34 CODEX MAGICA that a moral vacuum is inherent in the minds of these men of perverse pride. • ELITISM Closely linked with their perverse and exaggerated pride is the corrupt reality that the men of the Illuminati do, indeed, run most things in society. They are the elite, and, unfortunately, they are afflicted with elitism. They do receive unfair advantage and exalted status in society. Sadly, the dumbed down masses adore the men and women of the elite. Elitism is a sickness, a disease. The men (and women) who are pictured in Codex Magica giving secret signs and sharing covert hand grips no doubt enjoy a smugly satisfying sense of perversity in knowing they are deceiving those whom, they are persuaded, are the ignorant and unknowing multitudes. The Inner Circle and Their Puppets The elite of the Illuminati are themselves divided by rank and authority. There is a hidden inner circle, followed by a several hundred-member core. Next, we have perhaps three to five thousand in a larger circle of influence, and then finally, another ten thousand puppets. The latter group, the puppets, have no real influence on matters of importance. This group includes celebrities, media representatives, educators, and others who are only vaguely aware that an elitist global conspiracy exists. They simply know that they must hew to the \"party line.\" The puppets also realize they must maintain a strict form of political correctness by promoting globalism and the approved socialist agenda. They are required to rigorously adhere to the \"script\" provided and continue to loyally wear the individual \"mask\" they have been supplied. John Swinton, newsman and former editor at The New York Times once shocked his audience at a luncheon meeting of the press by boldly confessing: There is no such thing in America as an independent press. You know it and I know it... The business of the Journalist is to destroy truth; To lie outright; To pervert; To vilify; To fawn at the feet of mammon, and to sell his county and his race for his daily bread. You know it and I know it and what folly is this toasting an independent press? We are the tools and vassals for rich men behind the scenes. We are the jumping jacks, they pull the strings and we dance. Our talents, our possibilities and our lives are all the property of other men. We are intellectual prostitutes. Swinton appears to have known very well that the careers and activities of his peers in the media are strictly controlled and regulated by their elite masters. And this rankled him. But then, after Swinton's comments that day, little was ever heard again from the man."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"THE MEGALOMANIA AND RAGE OF THE PSYCHOPATHS 35 The Group Mind and the Insectoids As Michael Hoffman II once sagely noted, the analogy of \"insects\" often resides in the true tale of the initiates of secret societies and orders. This is because these men are themselves deceived by Lucifer, and so they go about deceiving others. Thus there is a Group Mind resident in all these people, whether an Illuminatus is a member of the inner circle or is a lowly puppet. It is for reason that Professor Adam Weishaupt, co-founder of the classical Order of the Illuminati (May 1, 1776), called his sect the Beenan Order (Order of the Bees). Jim Keith, in Mind Control and UFOs, also noted this hive mentality. Keith wrote that in the South American nation of Columbia, there is a German community which, even today, over 60 years after World War II, uses the swastika as its icon. This group calls its compound \"Hormiga,\" in honor of the obedient worker ant, yet another form of Illuminati insectoid. 9 Thus, we find the beehive or anthill as apt metaphors for the servants of the Illuminati. It is fascinating to realize that these people are servile, weak, and crawling little personalities. They echo in unison the words \"Yes, Master\" to their superiors, the potentates of the various secret societies and orders. The underlings of the Illuminati, in effect, are abject and craven cowards, groveling in fright and terror before their Illuminist chieftains; yet, they act in public as though they are superior beings —oh, so special and \"hoity toity,\" as the saying goes. Believing in their own inflated self-worth, they consider themselves members of a higher-level caste while categorizing the masses outside their group as like so many cattle or sheep—even as \"useless eaters.\" They Look Down On the Inferior Goyim Such is the distorted view of the Jewish Illuminati who derogatorily refer to Gentiles as the goyim (cattle). The late Dr. Israel Shahak, Professor at Hebrew University in Israel, a man I respected greatly, was a constant critic of such a deviant, superiority attitude. Shahak noted that many Zionist Jews are unashamed advocates of human slavery: The Israelis have resuscitated a book in Spanish by Jews dating from the 14th century which has been adopted for use as a manual of religious instruction in Israel's secondary schools. It explains why non-Jews ought to be the slave of Jews because Jews are the elite of the human race. Because of this they deserve to have slaves, and these slaves must be non-Jews. 10 This outrageous and imperious attitude does not take those of us by surprise who have studied the Jewish Talmud, the rabbis' holiest book. According to the Talmud, Gentiles are not even to be considered humans: \"The goyim (Gentiles) are not men, but beasts\" (Baba Mezia fol. 1146). It should be further noted that the Encyclopedia Britannica says, \"The Talmud is still the authoritative and practical guide of the great mass of the Jews.\" (From the"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"36 CODEX MAGICA 9-volume German language translation of The Babylonian Talmud in the Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.) Slaves and Beasts Slaves and beasts! That is what the Zionists of Israel consider those who aren't Jewish. Now we discover what the elitist, favored sons of the Zionist Illuminati think of you, me, and the masses. No wonder they kill without conscience through their instigation of world wars, through initiation of regional conflicts, and through assassinations and other criminal deeds. The elite plot and carry out heinous terrorist acts and institute financial crises and cultural upheavals to force the Hegelian dialectical process along its desired path toward a New Age New World Order. Deaths are \"acceptable losses,\" the Illuminati reason, and pain and suffering are necessary for requisite changes to occur in society. In any event, since those outside The Order are relegated to the lowly categories of \"slave and beast,\" why wring one's hands or otherwise unduly concern oneself with whether such miscreants as you and me live or die? The Malthus Principle suggests to the Illuminati that periodically thinning the global population is a good thing. Evolution, they believe, calls for the survival of the fittest, and they view themselves as superior and most fit to rule. Elitism is certainly a disease, a mental disease, and those afflicted with it experience no guilt whatsoever in performing magical rituals of all kinds to enhance and accentuate their elite status and signal their superior \"knowledge\" to their occultic peers. • SIGNAL Scan the pages of this book, Codex Magica, and you immediately discover that the conspirators of the Illuminati have a deep, dark desire to signal each other. They seem to be obsessed with flaunting their special ties with each other as well as their membership in the Brotherhood of the Elite at large. Could it be that these men —sharers of occult secrets and sharers of crimes —also share a joint consciousness and recognition of their mission as individual members of a commonly shared destiny? I believe that is the case. In Conscious Evolution, Dr. Barry McWaters acknowledges this commonality, this attempt to unify on the part of the insiders, each of which, he acknowledges, make a \"unique contribution:\" In this way the differentiated parts...come to recognize that our common task is a Trans-human one, a goal beyond ourselves. 11 McWaters notes that, \"Many people have opened themselves to serve as channels.\" By their individual acts of performing rituals, including the communication of signs and symbols which embody intense energies and are magical in effect, there is expected to arise a \"transformed humanity, creating a new heaven and a new earth to manifest itself.\" 12"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"THE MEGALOMANIA AND RAGE OF THE PSYCHOPATHS 37 In effect, the co-conspirators are performing a psychic form of magic. By the combination in the ethereal world of millions of ritual acts by individuals, it is believed that a collective transformation of mankind and of earth will take place. When a critical mass is achieved, a quantum leap in consciousness will spontaneously occur. The catalytic process of magic on a mass, continuing scale will help push this process along to completion. Then and only then will the Universal Mind, long a cherished goal of the elite, be realized. Meanwhile, the co-conspirators believe they are mass-conditioning humanity and helping to build archetypes of energy forces in the collective consciousness that tend to create a binary, dialectical process of chaos that will result in the Hegelian achievement of equilibrium. This, they are convinced, will catapult the world into a global-wide Zionist state, ruled by an enlightened dictatorship made up of Masonic overlords who wisely rule and are beyond good and evil. In effect, the co-conspirators are persuaded they are each a cell, or molecule, playing a certain role within a greater organism. Their deceit is to imagine themselves an energy unit, or snapshot within a holographic universe in which all things are related and are one: \"Further, not only is there one unity, but there are unities within unities within unities. \" 13 But of course, at the top of their unified pyramid is the controlling entity with the all-seeing eye. That, indisputably, is Lucifer. Interesting is the fact that each of the co-conspirators fully recognize what the others are doing. Each understands the mask he must wear and the signals to be given. In a Public Broadcasting System (PBS) documentary, the story is recounted of the day President Harry S. Truman, a 33rd degree Mason, met Hollywood director and actor Orson Welles (War of the Worlds and Citizen Kane fame). Truman smiled and said to Welles, \"You're the second greatest actor alive today. I'm the first.\" • WEALTH What would compel grown men to act like immature, two-bit stage actors, twisting and distorting their fingers, hands, and bodies into ridiculous symbolic gestures in what appears to be a ludicrous campaign to force magical change or to convey secret messages via the media to fellow conspirators equally brainwashed? Most of these men are wealthy. Is that a factor? Does wealth confer on a man the unbecoming non- quality of stupidity? Is the secret coding and sending of messages, by word and by visual means, a process or activity of stupid, wicked rich men? Not all wicked and powerful men are wealthy, but many are. Disproportionately so. Having studied the lives and work of the elite, I can testify that their idle lifestyle and wealth often becomes an impediment to their moral development and to their potential exercise of good judgement and common sense. This is especially true of members of Dynasty family lines —the Bushes, Kennedys, Clintons, Roosevelts, Bronfmans, Rothschilds, the royal families in Europe, etc. Idiotic Behavior, Witchcraft and Magic Wealth and idleness lead to boredom, and boredom to idiotic and aberrant, bizarre"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"38 CODEX MAGICA behavior. But though we may laugh at what seem to be the comedic and unfruitful attempts of the elite to use coded messages and symbolism in magazines, newspapers, on TV, and in other media, for them this is no laughing matter. It is serious business. It is ritual witchcraft, and without it, their lives would revert to the mundane. Witchcraft and magic having become an essential part of their lives, they are addicted and must continue. As one famous witch once remarked, \"I had no self- control. My appetite for performing spells and working magic eventually became insatiable. Satan kept wanting more and more, and I had to provide it.\" The scriptures say that the love of money is the root of all evil. Not just of some evil, but of all evil. The concentration of wealth into fewer and fewer hands translates into the concentration of evil into fewer and fewer hands. The idle wealthy soon lose perspective and are out of touch with the serfs and vassals. The slave state, at its zenith, is run by dullards, silly men who have convinced themselves that a secret handshake made in front of a camera—or a hand sign flashed by them on a TV news program — turbo-props their personal progress in the ranks of the elite. They are also convinced that their use of covert signs, grips, handshakes and symbols helps in their acquisition of greater satanic powers, leading to greater control by them over the unknowing peasantry. Foolish, But Also Dangerous Tragically, these men, though often foolish and dull, are dangerous to us all. The silly man who is given control and management over the keepers to the keys to the nuclear-tipped ICBMs that sit deep inside the earth is, indeed, a dangerous man. So, too, are men whose banking, financial, and corporate decisions can plunge entire nations into desperate straits of bankruptcy and ruin. It is, moreover, no consolation to realize that the stupid and self-indulgent who populate the highest reaches of the Illuminati ranks are often cunning, sly, devious, and ethically-challenged. The imbecile son of a wise king is always less wise than his father, but upon his father's passing, he nevertheless assumes the throne. How often does history show that heredity renders a nation a cruel blow when the next generation takes command? In that instance, the cry of the people invariably rings out: \"The King is dead —oh no! —Well, okay, long live the King.\" Rarely do the men at the top echelons of the Illuminati deserve their powerful and influential positions based on merit. Their reign is based on, first, heredity, and, next, on cronyism and toadyism. Survival and promotion is not according to survival of the fittest, but survival of the most wealthy and the most favored. Sometimes, modern man looks at old newsreel footage of monsters like Lenin, Stalin, Mao, Hitler, Castro, and Mussolini, and they ask, How could entire nations have ever believed in such cartoonish, even outlandish, characters? But, remember, we see these men only in retrospect, and we fancy ourselves as being too smart to have ever been taken in by such odd personalities. Someday, an evil one will come who will be so wicked and diabolical he shall cause the masses everywhere to revere and honor him as a \"saint above saints.\" The scriptures say virtually the whole world will believe in and follow him. The"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"THE MEGALOMANIA AND RAGE OF THE PSYCHOPATHS 39 Illuminati elite surely will give this evil tyrant all their allegiance. They, along with the duped masses, will fall prey to the Strong Delusion, they will believe the Lie, and they will be Damned (II Thessalonians 2). • PLEASE To please their master, Lucifer, is the highest priority of the Illuminati. Illuminist Albert Pike, 33°, former Sovereign Grand Commander whose commentary on Freemasonry's rituals, Morals and Dogma, is the classic learning textbook for all Masons, issued instructions on July 14, 1889, to the Supreme Councils of the World identifying the Master whom Masons universally worship and venerate: That which we must say to the crowd is — we worship a God, but it is the God that one adores without superstition... To you, Sovereign Grand Inspector Generals, we say this; that you may repeat it to brothers of the 32nd, 31st, and 30th degrees—The Masonic religion should be, by all of us initiates of the high degrees, maintained in the purity of the Luciferian doctrine. 14 Pike's embrace of the \"Luciferian doctrine\" is not surprising. Manly P. Hall, 33°, considered by Freemasonry as the Lodge's greatest scholar of the 20th century, taught that the energies of Lucifer were necessary for the successful Masonic warrior. Meanwhile, John J. Robinson, whose book, Born in Blood, was celebrated by top Masonic Lodge officials as an accurate history of the Knights Templar and of Freemasonry, insisted in his later book, A Pilgrims Progress, that Lucifer is not Satan or the devil. Instead, Robinson insisted that Lucifer is an angel whose guidance and help can be employed either for good or for evil. Of course, Robinson's writings make clear that pleasing Lucifer is high-up on the Lodge's list of priorities. Lucifer the Divine Eliphas Levi, the cabalist magician whose artist depiction of Baphomet, the androgynous goat god, is illustrated elsewhere in this book, was more to the point. He recognized that Satan and Lucifer are, indeed, one and the same. But Levi also taught that Satan, believe by true Christians to be the enemy of God, is, in fact, man's helper and benefactor. Indeed Levi praised Satan, or Lucifer, as the \"angel presiding over the light of truth.\" \"Lucifer is divine and terrestrial,\" said Levi. \"He is the Holy Spirit\" and is the \"light-bearer in us. It is our mind.\" 15 Thus, we discover the cabalistic philosophy is not only that Lucifer is divine. He is integrated into and is one with the mind of the men who make up the Illuminati elite. Lucifer and these men are of one mind. This brings to pass the prophecies of Revelation 17 where we are told that the conspiracy of the elite in the endtime shall be composed of world leaders who will be of \"one mind for they will give all of their power and strength to the Beast.\" Unlike Eliphas Levi, most Illuminists are hesitant to identify Satan as their Lord."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"40 CODEX MAGICA Instead, they point to the Grand Architect of the Universe as their deity, or to a hazy and nebulous, unnamed \"God.\" We have discovered that most of the Illuminati elite make the ridiculous claim that they neither worship nor even believe in a being, or entity, named Satan. Many laugh—at least publicly—at the notion of a real entity known as the Devil. The Masonic Lodge not only publicly disavows worship of Satan, but also vainly attempts to cast Lucifer, pseudonym for the Devil, in the mold of a good angel, ostensibly sent here on earth only to assist man and introduce man to the \"better angels.\" The One About Whom Naught May Be Said In her eye-opening book, The Initiation of the World, occultist Vera Stanley Alder reinforces this pretense of the elite. She remarks that it is \"Deity\" without a name that is admired and worshipped. Furthermore, this mysterious Deity is esoterically described by her as the \"ONE ABOUT WHOM NAUGHT MAY BE SAID.\" Ironically, Alder does have a lot to say regarding the \"one about whom naught may be said.\" In fact, she praises this unnamed god as a being of immense \"wonder and magnitude.\" She suggests, too, that the One the elite worship may properly be referred to as the \"absolute.\" Alder also remarks that the entity she recognizes as the divine \"One\" is made up of \"forces,\" and he has dominion over certain—again unnamed — greater or lesser entities. 16 Of course, a rose by any other name is still a rose. And no matter how reluctant or tentative are the magicians of the Illuminati to come right out and identify the One whom they serve, we who have long studied these maladjusted rulers and their psychophants need not dodge the issue. Without question, a great many of the Illuminati know without a doubt whom they serve: Satan, also called Lucifer, the Devil, the Adversary. Their secret hand signs and grips, their symbols and their logos, indisputably prove this is so. • INVOCATION That demon principalities are invoked in the rendering of Masonic signs and other magical operations by the elite is a clear indication that these men are involved in witchcraft. It is not believed that the universe is some neutral machine, operating in a non-theological, pure, mechanical manner. Rather, there are believed to exist certain otherworldly spiritual hierarchies, entities that aid the elitist in creating a powerful effect upon the world. As witchcraft teacher Paul Huston explains: \"There simply exists power to be tapped to do good or to do evil...There exist certain entities who will aid you in your spells...You may call these entities gods, spirits, or watchers; or depersonalize them as powers or forces...\" 17 The Hierarchy These gods, entities, powers, or forces are said to be hierarchically arranged:"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"THE MEGALOMANIA AND RAGE OF THE PSYCHOPATHS 41 \"At the top, we have Great entities often known as Watchers, Mighty Ones, or gods...which can be contacted to bring a certain power to your rituals. Then there are spirit entities or demons halfway between men and gods in their constitution...Of course there are many minor, elemental spirits.\" 18 Huston says that talismans, images, and symbols—and hand and body signs and the positions and prescribed actions of body parts—will \"partake of the nature of a spirit or elemental.\" In other words, spirits are attracted and supposedly go to work on behalf of the person who wears or displays the magical talisman, charm, image, idol, or symbol, or who practices and puts into operation a particular hand sign, handshake, body movement, or position, or ritual, whether that ritual is simple or sophisticated. The more sophisticated and complex rituals and the more detailed, intricate, and powerful is the design of the talisman, symbol, hand sign, etc., the more likely a higher level entity—a being higher on the spiritual totem pole or pecking order so to speak—will be induced to participate in performing the desired magical act. That is, the greater the force of magic that will be applied. A great Entity, perhaps a prince or other high-up territorial potentate in the demonic spiritual realm, is naturally thought to possess the power to force changes in the real world. It is no accident that in the Bible, the last day, endtimes world ruler and his earthly human companions are said, to worship the \"God of Forces.\" Ritual Ceremonies and Demons of Secret Societies The leaders of the secret societies of the Illuminati would have to be supreme dullards not to recognize the demonic forces that are invoked in the ceremonial working of the various ritual degrees. C.W. Leadbetter, a 33rd degree Mason and occultist who was allied with Annie Besant and her Theosophical Society in the 1920s, is just one of many Masonic leaders who have acknowledged the participation of devil spirits. For example, Leadbetter says that the ritual for the 30th degree brings forth an angel who is \"a great blue Deva of the First Ray.\" In the 33rd degree, Leadbetter relates, two \"splendid fellow workers, spirits of gigantic size as compared to humanity and radiantly white in color are present.\" 19 In fact, Leadbetter said that the ritual for the 33rd degree actually links the Sovereign Grand Inspector General of Freemasonry with the \"Spiritual King of the World Himself; That Mightiest of Adepts who stands at the head of the Great White Lodge, in whose strong hands lies the destinies of earth.\" 20 • ENCOURAGE The frequency of the higher-level elite conveying occultic messages via hand signs, arm gestures, body postures, and similar means encourages lesser disciples. It reassures them that they are part of a cohesive and unified whole, members of a distinctive body of powerful and influential world movers and shakers. It is an"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"42 CODEX MAGICA awesome feeling, no doubt, to find oneself in company with the aspiring and actual rulers of the planet. Naturally, for the lesser initiate, seeing the top adepts displaying Masonic, Rosicrucian, O.T.O., and other signs and symbols in major propaganda and cultural organs (TV, newspapers, magazines, internet, books, public forums, etc.) also instills fear and dread. Fear and dread of what the Organization — powerful as evidenced by its public display of its chief symbols to a profane, ignorant mass audience —might do to them if they ever should be so bold or so foolish as to damage its assets, reveal its secrets, or betray it: There is an inevitability...which is at once its horror and its joy...once an accepted disciple has definitely undertaken the work in preparation for initiation, there is for him no turning back. He could not if he would... He has heard the voice of his Master. Occult obedience gives place to enlightened will. He can now be trusted to walk and work alone because he is unalterably one with his group, with the Hierarchy, and finally with Shamballa (hell). 21 The Carrot and Stick Approach Thus, we see in use by the top ranks of the elite the carrot and stick approach. If the fledgling initiate strays from the fold, or, worse, reveals any of the secrets of the Brotherhood, he will get the stick of punishment. But if he cooperates, he will be rewarded. He will find himself in the enviable position of being lauded as a co- creator of the world aborning. C. Fred Kleinknecht, 33°, Sovereign Grand Commander of Scottish Rite Freemasonry, in March, 2002, in The Scottish Rite Journal, boasted of this Creator role. In an article entitled, \"A Brave New World of Heroes,\" Kleinknecht encourages Masonic disciples by emphasizing: One of the great lessons of the Scottish Rite is this: We do not inherit the world, we create it. \"O brave new world, that has such people in it!\" —This line from Shakespeare's The Tempest seems particularly appropriate... 22 In practicing magic by employing secret signs, the sharing of covert handshakes, the use of power-attracting symbols, the use of hidden codes and other ritual means, the deceived initiate believes he is helping to build that Brave New World—a \"better\" world. Better, that is, for he and his magical associates. He is working as a member of the Group to alchemically break down and build back up society into a new order of things. He is, as we shall see, engaging in the rabbinic and cabalistic practice of Tikkun Olam, the repair and reconstruction of the world."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"THE MEGALOMANIA AND RAGE OF THE PSYCHOPATHS 43 • REBELLION The illuminated elitist does not regard himself as a man, but as a god. As such, he is, in fact, a rebel, engaged in rebellion against the one, true God. Collectively, the elite fancy themselves to be God. How does a mere human being arrive at such an imagined exalted state of existence? Vera Stanley Alder, in her celebrated textbook, The Initiation of The World, writes that once the Illuminist has been raised to become a \"unit within a great brotherhood,\" he progresses toward fusion and unity with the all-consciousness. In this state... Man is no longer worshipping God, asking things of God, trying to become like God. He knows that he is God...He is. 23 They Hate Without A Cause Here, then, we find an arrogant expression of hubris, pride, and, most of all, rebellion. Rebellion against God, against His Truth, and against His people. The Illuminati are revolutionaries. Their revolt has no rational cause. Christ Jesus noted: \"They hate me without a cause.\" The Illuminist strives for liberty and fulfillment of self- interest and will apart from God and His Will. That is why this brotherhood of evildoers are rebels, opposers of good, colluders with any and all forms of apostasy. The propensity of the Illuminati to engage in rebellion, against God, country, and even organized civilization itself is evidenced in the inner meaning of their centuries old rallying cry: \"Liberty, Equality, Fraternity,\" the esoteric meaning of which is liberty from the dictates of God, equality of all men only in death, and the unity of evildoers. Truly, the man who has taken vulgar and bloody oaths to defend The Order and has vowed to protect its secrets against onslaught by would be interlopers and intruders is not above killing those who oppose his ambitious personal goals or who stand in the way of the attainment of the objectives of the Order of the Illuminati. \"In Freemasonry It Is Permitted to Kill\" Consider the military trial of the Freemason, Cabrinovic, assassin of the Archduke Ferdinand of Austria, Hungary, a fateful event that touched off the deadly and fiery conflict of World War I. Cabrinovic's testimony at his trial provides us a graphic example of the rebellious spirit of the men of the secret societies and orders. Asked if he had conspired with other Freemasons to murder the Archduke and thus set off a saga of anarchy and mayhem throughout Europe, Cabrinovic told the military court, \"Yes, I knew we were all Freemasons, and this strengthened my resolve... Freemasonry strengthened my intention. In Freemasonry it is permitted to kill.\" Ah yes. \"In Freemasonry it is permitted to kill,\" testified the assassin Cabrinovic. How exquisitely truthful the man was as he sat in the witness chair, being called to account for his horrific crime. When we examine the historical record of the world's most despicable mass murderers and revolutionaries, we find that almost all of them were members of"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"44 CODEX MAGICA Freemasonry and other secret societies of the Illuminati: Robespierre was a Freemason; Weishaupt was a Freemason; Napoleon was a Freemason; Lenin was a Freemason; Stalin was a Freemason; Mussolini was a Freemason; Truman and Roosevelt were Freemasons; Ariel Sharon is a Freemason; Bill Clinton is a Freemason; Fidel Castro is a Freemason. Is There No Help For the Widow's Son? At his trial for conspiracy to commit homicide, satanist rebel Charles Manson was observed giving a variety of Masonic hand signs, including the Masonic sign of distress. The same sign was reportedly given by Mormon founder Joseph Smith as he lay dying on the floor of an Illinois jail on a variety of criminal charges. Lying bleeding and desperate, Smith's raspy voice could be heard crying out the plaintive, Masonic wail, calling on Masons to help a brother in dire trouble, \"Is there no help for the widow's son?\" Joseph Smith no doubt could not believe that he, a man who claimed to be God's Chosen Prophet but who secretly worshipped Lucifer; he, a man of such superior intellect and endowed with the occult gift of spiritual enlightenment, was about to meet his Maker, a victim of a vigilante mob who despised him. Jack Parsons, American rocket scientist, founder of California's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and a priest of the O.T.O., was, like Mormon Joseph Smith, a premier servant of Satan and a rebel against God. He even fancied himself to be the prophesied antichrist. Parsons wrote this chilling paragraph in his diary: And thus was I antichrist loosed in the world; and to this am I pledged, that the work of the beast shall be fulfilled, and the way for the coming of BABALON be made open and I shall not cease or rest until these things are accomplished. 24 A few years after writing this, Jack Parsons was killed in an explosion in a laboratory at his home, which also served as a meeting place for other members of his satanic order. He evidently was not to become the prophesied antichrist, a fact Parsons now knows only too well, residing as he is in some subterranean cell somewhere in a place called hell."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"THREE Concealed Messages—The Importance of Hand Signs to the I lluminati And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads... — Revelation 13:16 Raise the right hand...extending the two fingers like a fork...then draw it back over the right shoulder and with a quick motion dart the extended fingers forward in a horizontal direction.

In all the 33 degrees of Scottish Rite Freemasonry and in the rituals of the York Rite, the Order of Skull and Bones, the Ordo Templi Orientis, the Grand Orient Lodge of France, the Grand Lodge of Jerusalem, and on and on in almost all the secret societies and orders, handsigns, and handshakes are prominent. In Coil's Masonic Encyclopedia we read: \"The hand is important in Freemasonry...for the purpose of giving and receiving modes of recognition.\" 1 In"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"46 CODEX MAGICA"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"CONCEALED MESSAGES: THE IMPORTANCE OF HAND SIGNS 47 J. C. Coopers's An Illustrated Encyclopedia of Traditional Symbols 2 , the author notes that hand signs include the following symbolic meanings: Hand on Breast— submission and the attitude of a servant or slave Crossed at wrist (X) — binding or being bound Hand on neck— sacrifice Clenched fist— threat, aggression Raised hand— adoration, worship, horror, amazement Both hands raised, palm outward— weakness, supplication, acknowledgment, adoration, admiration Raised to head— thought, care, intellect, wisdom Numerical hand signs from a Renaissance text on mathematics. Such usage often combines the teachings of numerology with the secret messages of hand communications'. The International Secret Language Is the occult hand sign, in its many forms and varieties, the international secret language of the Freemasons and other covert societies? Manfred Adler, in his German-language book, The Freemasons and The Vatican, says the answer to this question is, yes. 3 He writes that according to the findings of a United States Senate Committee that investigated the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), \"Ninety percent of the secret news is transmitted via the media, in particular the press, with the aid of coded texts and pictures.\" 4 Messages in the Media Others, too, besides Adler, have noted the frequent use of hand signs in the media as signals of secret society insiders. Juan Maler, Argentine author and Masonic researcher, explains that the use of the hand sign is for the uninitiated a completely trivial and inconspicuous gesture. \"But for the members of the Secret Societies, the hand sign is used as a sign of recognition by those who are in a leading position or who have a mission to fulfill and usually appears with a relevant text.\" 5 Johannes Rothkranz, German authority on Masonic signs, suggests that, \"If one collects the photos of well-known personalities from the daily papers, then one possesses, in a very short time, a great number of conspicuous and — for those who understand the signs—also meaningful poses.\" 6 According to Rothkranz, the historic handshake between Helmut Kohl, then the"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"48 CODEX MAGICA Chancellor of West Germany, and Modrow, the head of the Communist East German regime which sealed the deal for German reunification was clearly a Masonic handshake. Rothkranz further notes that the historic handshake of the two elitists was shown at length on European television. 7 A Symbol of Power Why is the use of the hand considered to be so significant as a means of concealed communications by occultists? The Herder Dictionary of Symbols states that the hand is \"a symbol of activity and power.\" It notes that finding oneself \"in the hands of a ruler or god means being in that person's power, but also standing under that person's protection.\" 8 The dictionary goes on to say that the \"shaking or offering of the hand is a sign of friendly openers, devotion or forgiveness.\" But a closed hand signifies secrets or keeping silent. Other uses of hand signs are to indicate fear, threats, devotion, admiration, and argument. The Herder Dictionary explains, too, that, \"In antiquity, covered or veiled hands were generally customary when one approached high dignitaries.\" Hands with palms resting on one's knees express deep concentration and reflection. 9 The hand can also be used as a threat to any would-be traitors or betrayer of the Illuminist cause. In the authoritative Richardson's Monitor of Freemasonry we find an example of this in the second sign of the Super Excellent Master Mason. The sign consists of raising the right hand, making the two first fingers like a fork, and simulating the gouging out of the eyes of a \"traitor.\" On the Other Hand... There is a great symbolic difference between the use of the left and right hands. The right hand is said to be the hand of blessing, a good and positive influence, and those who use it in the occult world are known as those on the \"right-handed path.\" This is considered \"white magic.\" Those on the left-handed path, however, are practitioners of \"black magic.\" Full-fledged Satanists are typically of the left-handed path, though, in reality, it does not matter to the devil which hand is used! The left hand is ever considered the sinister hand. It is associated with words like diabolical, witchlike, clever, deceptive, sly, cunning, evil, wrong, backward, and perverse. The evil eye is said to be the left eye. Some early Christians (for example, the writer of the apocryphic Gospel of Nicodemus) taught that of the two thieves crucified next to Jesus, the one at his left side An odd, old drawing of a priest with hands in prayer, but aimed downwards toward Satan!"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"CONCEALED MESSAGES: THE IMPORTANCE OF HAND SIGNS d 49 At Left: Josephine Bonaparte's Palm from Mlle Le Normand's Les Memoires historiques et secrets de l'lmperatrice Josephine, Paris, 1827. At Right: The Sabazios Hand. Bronze symbol of the syncretic Jewish mystery cult of Sabazios in Asia Minor. Circa First Century, C.E. (Collection of the British Museum) rejected truth and was consigned to hell. In heaven, Jesus, of course, is believed to sit at the right hand of God, not the left. In Ecclesiastes, a book of the Old Testament in the Bible, it is said that, \"A wise man's heart is at his right hand, but a fool's heart is at his left.\" (Eccles. 10:2) Witches throughout history have danced in ritual circles to the left, that is, counterclockwise. Druid priests do likewise as they dance and march around the holy stone at Tara, Shrine of Mother Earth. To blaspheme God, some Satanists and witches derive pleasure in giving the sign of the cross with their left hands. But while witches and deep occultists are aware of the sinister nature and meaning of the left hand symbolically, one of the foremost Masonic authorities evidently has a more favorable view. Professor James Curl, author of the reference book, The Art and Architecture of Freemasonry, writes that, \"The left hand is the symbol of equity.\" 10 In other words the symbol of justice and fairness. Strange, indeed, unless one elevates the devil to the virtuous level of one who serves justice and brings equity or equality. But then, why would a Masonic authority think otherwise of the Lodge's true Grand Master, the Prince of the Power of the Air, aka Lucifer? An Indicator of Attitude According to most reference books of the occult, the positioning of the hand on a"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"50 CODEX MAGICA particular part of the body indicates one's mental attitude and inner meaning. A hand placed on the breast indicates a tender, loyal or sympathetic attitude. Placed on the neck, the hand denotes sacrifice and penalty, while the joining of hands signifies mystic marriage and fidelity. Three or more people linking hands signifies the joining of forces or energy, and is expressive of a virile fraternity and of solidarity in the face of danger. The authors of A Dictionary of Symbols note that the hand expresses \"ideas of action, as well as those of power and dominion.\" They say it is also a sign of royalty. The Jewish Kabbala (or Cabala) teaches that the left hand is the \"hand of punishment,\" while the righthand is the \"hand of blessing.\" 11 The same reference guide explains that the word \" manifestation\" derives from the same root as \"manus,\" the Latin word for hand. \"What is manifest can be held in, or grasped by, the hand.\" 12 The Fingers Can Be Revealing The position of a specific finger, or fingers, of a hand may also denote great importance. Sammy Davis, Jr., the black entertainer and member of the infamous Sinatra \"rat pack,\" confessed in his autobiography, Yes, I can, to being a Satan worshipper. The talented singer/dancer said that as a Satanist he painted the fingernail of his left-hand \"pinkie\" finger ebony black as a sign. \"The chicks loved it,\" said Davis, \"and found it really a sexual turn-on.\" Some Islamic imams (teachers) preach that the hand of Fatima, a revered daughter of Mohammed, represents the summation of the whole religion of Islam, and that Fatima's index finger points heavenward to Allah. A hand with finger pointed to or touching the lip indicates, \"Be silent.\" A finger touching or pointing to the head signifies \"intellect or wisdom.\" The pictures and illustrations in this section and the immediately following sections give evidence of the importance the Illuminati minions give to the use of hands, either in handshakes and grips, or in various poses. The old phrase, \"a show"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"CONCEALED MESSAGES: THE IMPORTANCE OF HAND SIGNS 51 of hands\" certainly has a multiplications of meanings to the members of secret societies. Open to Interpretation? A word of caution and advice is in order, however. Although I have used the best reference guides and the best knowledge obtainable from myriad investigative sources, it is sometimes very difficult to judge and evaluate a particular handshake, hand sign, pose or grip. For one thing, even though a masonic reference book or occult textbook may clearly spell out the specifications for a type of grip or sign, the people who practice it are not always so precise. I noted in a 20-year career in the U.S. Air Force that while the military manuals and guidebooks clearly explain how to perform a hand salute, not all in uniform complied. Some high-ranking officers render a shoddy, confusing, lackadaisical salute while others give a snappy, precise salute exactly as the textbook prescribes. One can see a hundred different types of salutes at a typical Air Force Base exchanged on a given day, each a little bit different in one aspect or the other. And, of course, if you compare the way the U.S. military salutes with the salute of a British Sergeant Major, the difference is striking, indeed. Still, even taking into account the human factor, it is possible to identify many of the hand signs and poses given and used by the elite. Check out my selection on the pages that follow and see if you agree. Many secret orders and societies display and use secret handshakes and signs. In Wales (Great Britain) the Order of the True Ivorites was established in 1836 and prospered for many years. Some believe two lodges of Ivorites still exist today. Pictured here are some of their secret signs and handshakes."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"FOUR Hidden Hand of the Men of Jahbuhlun Because the higher trinity of man's being must be present before soul-union can take place...the Omnific Royal Arch Word can only be given in groups of three...

Yermak The Axis of Death Over my many years of exposing the lies and evils of Freemasonry, the Ordo Templi Orientis, the Rosicrucians, and other treacherous cultic secret societies, I have been challenged by many Masons. Their typical complaint is, \"How dare you say such things about Masonry! Why, I'll have you know I am a Christian, and there is nothing in the Lodge or its rituals that would not be acceptable to my Christian faith.\" Of course, it is super-easy, almost like taking candy from a baby, to disabuse the Masonic whiner and complainer hollering that you or I have slandered the Masons by denying their order's \"Christian attributes.\" After all, there are scores of points to make that blow apart the silly notion that the Masonic Lodge or similar groups are even"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"54 CODEX MAGICA vaguely \"Christian\" in nature. But the easiest way to handle such a complaint is to ask the Mason if he has reached the Royal Arch Mason ritual level or equivalent (13th degree in the Scottish Rite). If he answers \"yes,\" then, uh oh, he is in big, big trouble. What About Jahbuhlun? I then ask him about the name of his sacred god revealed in the Royal Arch degree ritual; that is, I ask him about Jahbuhlun. And usually, I can hear either a long uninterrupted stutter, or else simply a great gasping sound. Generally, that ends the discussion right there. A Mason definitely does not want to publicly discuss that name, Jahbuhlun. Anything but that. Bamm! He's gone. And I can understand why. Ed Decker, a friend of mine, a good Christian who is an ex-Mason and ex- Mormon, now heads up a Christian ministry aimed at helping men get out of these cults. In a book that Ed edited, entitled, The Dark Side of Freemasonry, he writes that while Christians know full well that the sacred name of God is Jesus, the Mason is at first denied knowledge of the sacred name of their God and then belatedly finds out that the name of the Mason deity is definitely not Jesus, the name above every other name (Philippians 2:9-11). The Lost Name of God The Blue Lodge Masons, encompassing the first three degrees of Masonry, are instructed that they are seeking the Lost Word or the Lost Name of God...It isn't until they reach the level of Royal Arch Masonry (seventh degree, York Rite) that they discover that the Lost Name of God wasn't lost after all. It's at this level that they learn the sacred name of Masonry's God. They find that the sacred name of (the Masonic) God is composed of three names representing the three identities of God. It is so sacred it takes three Royal Arch Masons to be able to speak it.. Jahbuhlun. The three Masons grip hands high and low and chant, \"Jah-buh-lun, Jah-buh-lun, Jah-buh-lun, Je-hov-ah.\" The name Jahbuhlun has three syllables representing a composite God made up of three subordinate deities. The Masonic material identifies the three as Yah (or Yahweh), Baal, and Osiris. Logically, the name should be spelled Yah-Baal-On, but Duncan's Masonic Ritual and Monitor admits that over the years the spelling has been \"corrupted\" by Freemasonry until it reached its current form. 1 Decker correctly asserts that, \"What these men are doing is worshipping a demon god so far removed from the real God that this worship must surely defile the holiness of God and guarantee those who pronounce that name in such a ceremony a swift ride to Hell...\" 2 C.C Zain, a Freemason who is part of a group called \"The Brotherhood of Light,\" is developer and author of an entire course on Ancient Masonry having to do with \"The Spiritual Significance of Masonic Rituals, Degrees, and Symbols.\" Zain points out that the name Jahbuhlun is Masonry's Grand Omnific Word, the name of their omnipotent deity. He further shows the significance of the fact that the name Jahbuhlun has nine letters and is made up of three syllables, Jah, buh, lun. In the ritual for the Royal Arch Degree, since there are three Royal Arch Masons pronouncing the"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"HIDDEN HAND OF THE MEN OF JAHBUHLUN 55 name three times each, altogether, says Zain, twenty-seven syllables are pronounced. This, he explains, represents \"the twenty-seven days it takes the moon to pass through the circle of zodiacal signs.\" 3 Interestingly, in the ritual drama, the three Masons doing the pronouncing of Jahbuhlun are said to have come from Babylon! So, we have a ritual —the 13th degree in the Scottish Rite and 7th in the York Rite—in which three \"Masters\" come from Babylon (the font of all evils, see Revelation 13, 17, and 18 in the Holy Bible) to instruct the candidate on how to build the Royal Arch (symbolically, how to rebuild the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem and thus establish the kingdom of the elite and their devil god on earth). The Lost Word Found Moreover, the three messengers from Babylon inform the candidate that the true name of God, the name that had been lost for so long, is not Jesus, but is Jahbuhlun. They conveniently omit mention of the fact that this is, in fact, the name of a monstrous DEVIL GOD, that the name is an unholy and blasphemous composite of Jahweh, Baal, and Osiris, or On. (On is a city in Egypt where the worship of the sun god, Osiris, is alleged to have begun. Somehow, many in Masonry today honor and revere Osiris under the name of On, the name of his city, curiously spelled Un in the name: Jahbuhlun.) No wonder Masonic authority W.L. Wilmshurst, in his highly thought of (by Masons) The Meaning of Masonry, proclaims this degree so vital to the transformation of the candidate's life. He even suggests that in attaining this Degree, one \"exhibits the attainment of a new order of life.\" 4 The Royal Arch Degree, Wilmshurst emphasizes, provides \"a supremely high level of thought and instruction\" for the Mason attaining it. 5 Born Again or Demon-Possessed? What does Wimshurst mean when he says the adept has attained a \"new order of life?\" I believe the candidate receives a counterfeit born again experience, receiving the very spirit of Lucifer into his bosom as a result of conforming to the requirements of this degree. In accepting the devil god Jahbuhlun as the sacred name of God the man rising to this level in Masonry or a similar sect becomes demon possessed, full of the devil, headed for hell, prepared to do the most wicked and foul deeds possible for his hidden deity, Baphomet, aka Lucifer, aka Satan, aka Jahbuhlun. Now, the fatal (ending in spiritual death) sign that is taught for this degree is the one you will find men giving in the photographs in this chapter. Notably, only higher-level initiates and adepts will typically be seen giving this evil sign stamping them as demon-possessed disciples of Satan. I call this sign the Hidden Hand of the Men of Jahbuhlun. From Washington to Rothschild Regrettably, America's first President, George Washington, exhibited this sign, if the"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"56  CODEX MAGICA painter of one of his most famous portraits is to be believed. Subsequent Presidents, men like Franklin Pierce and Rutherford Hayes, were disciples of Jahbuhlun, as was President Teddy Roosevelt. We also have communists Karl Marx, Vladimir Lenin, and Joseph Stalin giving the sign, plus Napoleon, Salomon Rothschild, and many others whose images and pictures you will find in the ensuing pages, as they perform this devilish sign. Wine From A Human Skull Many other facets and activities pertaining to this degree's ritual stamp it as pure Luciferian and its holder as a Lucifer worshipper. During the initiation into the seventh degree Royal Arch Mason (York Rite) or 13th degree (Scottish Rite), the candidate drinks wine from a human skull. By this monstrous act, he reinforces the fact that he has taken an oath swearing to \"have his skull struck off and his brains exposed to the scorching rays of a median sun\" should he ever divulge Masonic secrets. He goes on to demand that if he does divulge secrets, may all the sins of the dead person whose skull he is drinking from be heaped upon his, the candidate's, head. 6 So we see that the Mason's newfound \"God,\" Jahbuhlun (Jah-Baal-On), is a rigid taskmaster who does not look kindly on traitors and blabbers. It was the Canaanite god Baal, of course, to whom the backslidden Jews and pagans sacrificed their children in the fire. You'll recall that the prophet Elijah brought the message of God's judgement against those who worshipped bloodthirsty Baal, who, in reality, is merely an idolatrous representation of Satan. Yes, Baal is the devil. To attempt in vain to combine the name of the true God with that of false gods like Baal and On is particularly evil and grievous to the true God in heaven. Yet, the Mason does exactly this with Jahbuhlun and then compounds his grave error by adopting as one of his chief logos the sign of the double-headed eagle (symbolizing one body of God, two heads!) The Triple Tau Yet another proof of the deviltry of the Jahbuhlun hoax is the symbol of the Triple Tau, which is the most important symbol of the Royal Arch Degree. Made up of three interlinking tau symbols (T), these three are said to represent a triad of sacred, Jewish powers of king, priest, and prophet. In other words, the Mason assumes a trinity of The Triple Tau is the most significant symbol, or logo, of the Royal Arch Mason. It represents the Mason who has reached either the seventh degree of the York Rite or 13th degree of the Scottish Rite as embodying within the attributes of the Godhead, or Holy Trinity, by blasphemously declaring himself to be the great I Am That I Am, thus identifying himself with Satan's promise in the Garden, \"ye shall be as gods.\""},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"HIDDEN HAND OF THE MEN OF JAHBUHLUN 57 Jewish spiritual powers. 7 Actually, this trinity of the Jews is in competition with the true Godhead of the Bible: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. \"I Am that I Am,\" the Mason Proclaims Equally blasphemous is that in the lecture on the seventh, or Royal Arch Degree, of the York Rite, the Mason initiated is asked the question, \"Are you a Royal Arch Mason?\" His answer is required to be: \"I am that I am.\" 8 In other words, in this degree's ritual the Mason has not only acknowledged that the devil, in the guise of Jahbuhlun, is his sacred Lord, but he now is declaring that he, himself, a mere man, is the great I am! In other words, he is saying, \"I am God!\" Uncovering the Hidden Hand Now you see why I entitled this chapter, \"The Hidden Hand of the Men of Jahbuhlun.\" In the early degrees, the Mason is told that the name of God has been lost. He's even told that he should use a substitute name for God, MAHABONE. But later, after he's swallowed whole the rotten fabric of degree ritual after degree ritual, the bamboozled and propagandized fellow is finally told that the one he is to worship goes by the name Jahbuhlun and that he is now ready to declare himself, a man, as the great I AM. Obviously, the Illuminati's Masonic elite do not want the general public to know these terrible things. After all, incredibly, Freemasonry's public image is that it is some kind of \"Christian\" group. So, the pretense must be maintained and the secrets buttoned up from the \"profane and vulgar\" masses (you and me, dear reader). Therefore, the name of the horrible god whom the Masons worship must stay hidden. The name and identity of the hidden god must be concealed at all costs, and thus an appropriate hand sign has been devised to represent this grotesque coverup: the Sign of the Hidden Hand. How to Perform the Sign Figure 34 shown here is taken directly from Duncan's Masonic Ritual and Monitor (3rd Edition). It pictures the Royal Arch Mason performing the magical Sign of the Master of the Second Veil, which I informally and more informatively call here the Sign of the Hidden Hand of the Men of Jahbuhlun. According to Duncan's the candidate presents this sign when he is approached by three sojourners from Babylon. Their objective: Rebuild the Temple of Solomon in Jerusalem and eventually establish a world empire of the Jews."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"58 CODEX MAGICA In his teaching course on Ancient Masonry, C.C. Zain of The Brotherhood of Light explains that the ritual for this degree requires a keen understanding of astrology. But, its performance is said to be derived from a passage in the scriptures. \"The sign is made,\" writes Zain, \"by thrusting the hand into the bosom and again drawing it out.\" 9 The official Masonic explanation for this sign—a myth intended to divert the profane from the truth — is that it refers to the fourth chapter of Exodus in the Holy Bible: \"And the Lord said unto Moses, put now thine hand into thy bosom; and he put his hand into his bosom; and when he took it out, behold his hand was leprous as snow.\" Leprous, indeed, is the hand of the Mason who vainly seeks to hide and coverup his fides oath of allegiance to Jahbuhlun, his sacred god. But, believe me, there is no relationship of the Mason to Moses, a prophet of God who loyally worshipped the true I AM, the God who reigns for all eternity in heaven."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"HIDDEN HAND OF THE MEN OF JAHBUHLUN 59"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"60 CODEX MAGICA George Washington in a Masonic pose.

But he notes it is in a lower degree. The Masons, in the Middle Ages, he writes, were divided into two classes, Masters and Fellows: Those who were of greater skill held a higher position and were designated as Masters while the masses of the Fraternity, the commonality, as we might say, were called Fellows. 3 Put another way, Mackey says that those possessing more \"cunning\" were graded as Masters, while the Fellows were of \"lesser wit.\" 4 But of course, today, most all Masons begin by being initiated into the First Degree (Entered Apprentice). Then, the new Member is said to be passed into the Second Degree (Fellow Craft), and next is raised in the Third Degree (Master Mason). These are the three degrees of what is called the Blue Lodge of Freemasonry. Why Is It Employed By High level Illuminists? In this chapter we will reveal a number of high-rank llluminists giving the Sign of Fellow Craft (2°) Mason. Now since this degree is of lower status, this begs the question of why such famous, publicly acclaimed men as evangelists Billy Graham and Pat Robertson, as well as occult leader Annie Besant, Russian President Boris Yeltsin, and international financier Sir James Rothschild are all displaying the Fellow Craft sign. The answer is a fascinating one. Mackey writes that the degree —and thus its primary sign —denotes a \"fellow workman,\" a commoner. In other words, it represents the masses of common people. It represents, adds Mackey, the \"Stage of manhood\" and the maturation of humanity by progression of man's \"reasoning faculties and...intellectual powers.\" 5 In essence, the Fellow Craft degree represents man progressively brought to a high status of possessing the supreme wisdom of the serpent. Man as a whole becomes god through reason.

Then, draw the hand smartly across the breast from left to right and let it drop to the side. In performing the sign, the individual is taking his right hand, making a type of beastly devil's claw out of it and then raking it across the breast from left to right. C. F. McQuaig, in The Masonic Report, calls this the Penal sign. It is made to remind the person giving it of his oath taken, that if he discloses the secrets of the Order or gives aid and comfort to its enemies, he should have the right breast torn open and the heart torn out.

Crowley's wicked philosophies and his ritual experimentation—such as the \"Babalon Working\" ritual designed to invoke the coming of Antichrist—greatly inspired copycats and imitators.

People that are Christians now, but were Satanists, recognized President Clinton's signal at his inauguration as a sign of Satan. That seems fairly cut and dried, and it is. Clinton communicated what he wanted to the people to whom he wanted to communicate. The whole affair with him flashing the Satanic handsignal took only a couple of seconds. Fritz Springmeier Bloodlines of the Illuminati It is being flashed everywhere—on TV, in newspapers and magazines, at sporting events, and even at presidential inaugurations. I'm referring, of course, to the sign of El Diablo, the horned devil, also known as the sign of Il Cornuto and as Diabolicus. It began in the modern era with the followers of satanic cults, the members of the official Church of Satan, and heavy metal rock music bands and fans flourishing the sign of two separated fingers upward sign. The rock bands made it popular and trendy, and now it seems almost everyone is doing it. Three versions of the \"El Diablo,\" the sign of Satan, the horned god. The hand sign at right is also the deaf's gesture, or signing, for \"I love you,\" a fact which has many people confused."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"120 CODEX MAGICA I Love You, Devil? The sign often is confused with the deaf's signing of the phrase, \"I love you.\" While at first this appears an odd resemblance, we register an \"ahh, I get it!\" emotion when we discover that the person who invented, or created, the hand sign system for the deaf, Helen Keller, was herself an occultist and Theosophist. Did Keller purposely design the deaf's \"I love you\" sign to be such a remarkable imitation of the classic sign of Satan? Was Keller saying, basically, \"I love you, Devil?\" Then, we have the confusion of the El Diablo hand sign with the University of Texas \"hook 'em horns\" sign. Texas' mascot is the longhorn cow and it is only natural that the horns sign be employed by the student body, alumnai, and fans of that great institution. When Jenna Bush, the daughter of President George W. Bush, gave the horns sign at the 2004 presidential inauguration, it shocked the world. Most viewers of international TV did not know that Jenna is a recent graduate of the University of Texas. However, at that same inaugural gala, the President also was photographed giving the sign, and so was the other Bush daughter. Not only that, but the First Lady, Laura, and even the President's mother, Barbara Bush, got into the mix. They, too, were seen giving the sign. Hmmm. Partying, Drinking, Rebellion, Or...? With the rapid rise in popularity of the El Diablo sign among rock fans, many people seem to be blissfully unaware of the satanic background and dark history of this sign. To some, giving the sign more likely indicates their eagerness and gusto for fun, partying, drinking, and youthful rebellion. Thus it is that I leave it to you, the reader, to decide which of the persons shown here, in this chapter, in rendering the El Diablo sign, are paying homage to Satan and which are employing it for some other purpose. I have my own opinion, what's yours? For example, in the picture shown here you'll discover former President Bill Clinton, from Arkansas, and Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi giving the sign. Are they telling us they are Texas Longhorns fans or that they love Satan? A final word: Even if you and I are willing to overlook the giving of this sign by many as not intentionally satanic, we cannot dismiss the evidence that many, if not most, who employ the sign are, in fact, thereby honoring Satan, the rebellious dark angel. The case here, later in this chapter, of the vampire satanists who stabbed a victim 66 times and drank his blood undeniably stamps the El Diablo hand sign given by the murderers as intensely satanic in nature. Neither can the picture here of the Hindu sect member, the witch, and of Anton LaVey, High Priest of Satan, giving the sign also be disputed or explained away. As for the photos of the top-ranked Christian evangelists shown in the pages that follow, what do you have to say, dear reader?

For example, the higher degree Mason, Rosicrucian, or other Illuminist can discern at what ritual level a brother in the Craft is 'at by testing his handshake, or grip. It is, therefore, an important mode of recognition. The commonly used phrase, \"Get a grip,\" has Masonic origins. The handshake, or grip, is a sign of unity, oneness of purpose and allegiance or devotion to joint cause. It is considered a bond, or seal, of acknowledgment between Illuminist brethren. The Masonic authorities speak of a \"mystic tie\" or spiritual union. Certainly, demon powers do congregate together and enjoy one another's foul company. The God of Fidelity The Illuminist handshake, the clasping or joining of hands, can have many meanings. Its simplest is as a symbol of fidelity. Interestingly, Dr. Cathy Burns, in her informative expose, Hidden Secrets of the Eastern Star, notes that even at this basic level, The instructions issued the candidate of the Entered Apprentice, or First Degree, of Freemasonry include these given here. Notice that the candidate is asked, \"How shall I know you to be a Mason?\" His answer: \"By certain signs, a token, a word, and the perfect points of my entrance.\" Then, when he is asked, \"What are tokens?,\" he replies, \"Certain friendly or brotherly grips, by which one Mason may know another in the dark as well as in the light.\" (Duncan's Masonic Ritual and Monitor, p. 42)"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"146 CODEX MAGICA the Illuminist is signifying allegiance to a deity other than the Christian God. For example, Dr. Burns quotes Albert Mackey, 33°, former Sovereign Grand Commander of the Scottish Rite, who admits: The right hand has in all ages been deemed an emblem of fidelity, and our ancient brethren worshipped Deity under the name of Fides or Fidelity, which was sometimes represented by two right hands joined... Numa was the first who erected an altar to Fides under which name the Goddess of Oaths and Honesty was worshipped. 1 Burns points out that this reference to the worship of the Roman pagan goddess is literally repeated by the initiate in the very first degree of the Masonic ritual. Yet the Holy Bible commands: \"Thou shalt have no other gods before Me.\" (Exodus 20:3) and goes on to emphatically state: \"Make no mention of the names of other gods, neither let it be heard out of thy mouth.\" (Exodus 23:23) In volume 1 of Albert Mackey's Encyclopedia of Freemasonry, a large section is devoted to a discussion of the hand and hand signs. Mackey states: \"In Freemasonry, the hand as a symbol holds a high place...The same symbol is found in the most ancient religions and some of their analogies to Masonic symbolism are peculiar.\" Mackey revealingly says that the hand is deemed important \"as that symbol of mystical intelligence by which one Mason knows another in the dark as well as in the light.\" He goes on to discuss the use of the hand in such ancient Mystery Religions as Mithraism and in worship of the Sumerian, Assyrian, and Babylonian gods. He notes that the tradition of the red seal attached to important documents is a throwback to the ancient use of the bloody hand as a way of authenticating documents. Examples of Grips and Handshakes I have included in this section of Codex Magica drawings of a number of Masonic handshakes taken from official Masonic publications and from other objective sources. In addition to Freemasonry, there are scores of Illuminati secret societies and many have their own unique handgrips and signs. Moreover, the Mormon Church, the Sufi Muslim Brotherhood, and even the notorious Mafia have their own identifying handgrips and signs. In the pages that follow in this chapter, you'll see a large number of well-known persons sharing handgrips and handshakes that clearly are Masonic and Illuminist. Subject to Interpretation It is true that a handshake can be a questionable thing in its interpretation. All of us have attempted handshakes when greeting old friends and meeting new acquaintances. Sometimes your hand and theirs do not quite meet and clasp as you and they intended. It might be the fit of the hands due to the relative difference in size of each person's hands; or perhaps the distance between the two persons' bodies,"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"SECRET HANDSHAKES OF THE ILLUMINATI 147 causing a longer or shorter reach; or some other factor (Maybe the individual is short or tall, is just not good at shaking hands, etc.) I have done my best to take all these uncontrollable factors into consideration here and I include only what I believe to be indisputable Masonic and Illuminist handshakes, tokens, and grips. Naturally, one must especially consider who is shaking whose hand — and whether the person is known to be an Illuminist, a Mason, a Rosicrucian, an O.T.O. adept, or so forth. With these caveats in mind, let us take a look at the secret handshakes of the Illuminati. But first this brief article by Christopher Story. (NOTE: The following article by Englishman Christopher Story was originally published in the Economic Intelligence Review, (Westminster, England) and was reprinted in Des Griffin's Midnight Messenger (May/June 2004). It is reprinted here for the reader's interest.)

A huge photograph showed Tony Blair, our Fabian revolutionary Prime Minister, shaking hands with Adrian Nastase, the son of Illie, a leading Communist who \"survived\" the fall of Ceausescu. The Romanian Prime Minister is shown doing a five-knuckle grip (five-point degree), indicating to those whom Lenin called \"the interested\" that he's \"a member of the club.\" Masons call their handshakes \"grips\" —hence the saying, \"Get a grip.\" Let's \"get a grip\" with what's going on here. All of a sudden, newspapers on both sides of the Atlantic have taken to publishing large photos of our \"chosen ones\" indulging in various manifestations of Masonic \"grips.\" There was that Kerry- Clinton handshake published in The Washington Times in March. In that instance, Clinton was demonstrating, for those \"in the know,\" just who was boss, and how high up in the geomasonic stratosphere he is (right at the top). The \"grip\" in question was a Ma-Ha-Bone Lion's Paw Grip, which leaves the junior party in no doubt who's in charge (and in pain as a consequence). On 26th March, British newspapers carried an enormous picture of Tony Blair's \"grip moment\" with Libyan dictator, Muammar Qadhaffi. Before proceeding, it needs to be said that these close-ups of Qadhaffi's face reveal this man to be burdened with the most evil physiognomies on record —far nastier than those of Adolf Hitler and Saddam Hussein combined: in fact Saddam looks quite benevolent beside this creature."},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"148 CODEX MAGICA For his part, Blair looked extremely uneasy, his eyes watery, and his faced tensed up after what may have been some unspeakable encounter or other about which the record is silent (worse case scenario).

Our expert geomasonic handshake analyst writes that \"the Blair-Qadhaffi handshake is a Shibboleth Grip which denotes fellowship and total agreement. The purpose of these photographs is to tell fellow Masons that these two are 'one.'\" Beneath the photograph was a caption containing the following odd language: \"Clearly he (Blair) has not read Emily Post, the doyenne of 20th Century etiquette. \"The proper handshake,' she wrote, 'is made briefly...and one should look into the countenance of the person whose hand one takes' (Blair was looking at the camera instead of course). But more to the point, this gratuitous reference to Emily Post was intended, our U.S. based expert writes, 'to show compatibility with the USA Scottish Rite. The palmetto in the background (there was a garish green wallpaper behind the pair—Ed.) reminds me of the State Flag of South Carolina (Charleston, on the 33rd parallel is the headquarters of the US Scottish Rite masonry — Ed.), and also relates to the prominence of the Middle East in all things occult.\" On the same day (i.e., the photo research had been done well in advance), The Independent newspaper carried a double spread entitled: \"PLEASED TO MEET YOU: THE HISTORIC HANDSHAKES THAT SHOOK THE WORLD.\" It showed the following geomasonic grips: Gerry Adams and Clinton, 12th December 1995: Shibboleth; Kim Jong-Il and Kim Dae-Jung (of the two Koreas), 12th December 2000 (Ma-Ha-Bone Grip (master masons); Yasser Arafat and Yitzhak Rabin, with top Mason Clinton looking on, 13th September 1993: Ma-Ha-Bone Grip (Lion's Paw, master mason; Pervez Musharraf and Atal Vajpayee, 6th January 2002: Shibboleth Grip (\"friendship\"); and most revealing of all Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev, meeting for the first time in Versoix, Switzerland, 9th November 1985.

A single hand raised with palm outward represents a hand to heaven acknowledging the gifts or help received from extraterrestrial sources.

Yet another meaning is that the hand with all five fingers showing, palm outward, indicates that one is giving honor and admiration to the Underworld Deity. Its essential meaning: \"Thank you O Subterranean Lord for your deceptive wisdom and for your cunning aid in our struggle to overcome our enemies and to effect the Great Work.\" Pharaoh Ramses paying homage to the god Horus, son of Osiris, the sun god deity symbolized as the all- seeing eye in the capstone on the U.S.A.'s dollar bill. Quite possibly, the Masons' Sign of Admiration and Astonishment came from practices of adherents to the old Mystery Religions of Babylon and Egypt. (From book, Other Worlds, Hilary Evans, Readers Digest Books, 1998) On all occasions when the Egyptian high priest was called to officiate, he wore his robe of office, the spotted leopard's skin. The priest then led the rituals in worship of the \"Hidden One,\" the concealed mystery divinity, known esoterically as Saturn, the sixth planet from the sun. Here we see the priest, attired in leopard's skin, hands upraised, palms outward, exactly as is done in various Masonic, Rosicrucian, witchcraft, Thelemic, and O.T.O. rituals to this day.

Clinton the Devil, President of the U.S.A. President Bill Clinton was named Time magazine \"Man of the Year\" in 1993. On the Time cover making the announcement, President Clinton's head was pictured with the \"M\" in the Time masthead of the magazine stretched and appearing to be two horns on Clinton's head. 3 Were the magazine's editors telling us that Clinton is the devils' man, or was it some strange coincidence? Even more weird and dramatic, inside that same issue was a photo of Clinton in his Oval Office holding his hands and arms in the Masonic display of the sign of admiration. Now, get this: carved on the President's desk in the Oval Offices directly in front of Clinton is the eagle, in the presidential seal or logo, with its face turned to the left. But on the carpet just in front of the desk one finds the presidential seal facing toward the right: Two eagles, each facing in the opposite direction. This is clearly the double-headed eagle of Freemasonry, a symbol representing the Serpent, honored as the Sun God in the Mystery Religions with its eagle-like, all- seeing eye. In other words: Lucifer! Solar God of Bill Clinton and the Illuminati. Meanwhile, in Clinton's left hand (see page 183 of Codex Magica) is a rose —sign of the Illuminati's blood covenant and the Rosicrucian Order. You will also find here a photo of former Yugoslav Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic, likewise holding a rose in his hand, the right hand. In Satanism the left-handed path is the most magical and powerful, but more evil. Clinton (left-hand) is still today recognized by the world as a great leader. Milosevic (right-hand) is in disgrace, in a prison cell, after being felled by Clinton and his Illuminati cohorts, proving that it's not nice to attempt to doublecross your Illuminati overlords, Mr. Milosevic! In this chapter you will find not only Bill Clinton, Slobodan Milosevic, John Kerry, and others giving enigmatic ritual messages, but, also, we will examine other signs in which the Illuminati signal with the arms and either or both hands. The Grand Hailing Sign of Distress One classic Masonic pose, duplicated by or similar to that employed in many other Orders, is the Grand Hailing Sign of Distress. Theoretically, this is used in extreme circumstances in which a Mason or other elitist finds himself in a crisis or in a bind. In such an emergency he gives the Grand Hailing Sign of Distress, sometimes called the \"High Sign.\" At that point, brethren who recognize the secret sign of alarm are expected to come to his rescue. Comically, mass murderer Charles Manson was observed giving this sign and a number of others during his trial for conspiracy to commit murder. Reportedly, Manson believed the judge in his case was a 33° Mason and would rescue him. It was all to no avail. Likewise, Mormon Church founder Joseph Smith gave this sign while under siege of a lynch mob at the Nauvoo, Illinois jail where he had been incarcerated."},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"180 CODEX MAGICA Smith knew that the angry mob was comprised mainly of Freemasons because he, too, had been one of them until he was excommunicated. The Masons didn't take too kindly to Masonic Brother Smith's stealing their symbols and ceremonies and incorporating them into his Mormon (LDS) Church rituals. 4 As Joseph Smith lay dying on the jailhouse floor, he cried out, \"Is there no help for the Widow's Son?\" This is the enigmatic saying taught Masons, stamping Smith as a follower of the Great Goddess, patroness of the Masonic fraternity. The Bible in Revelation 27 refers to her as \"Mystery, Babylon the Great, Mother of Harlots.\" John J. Robinson, author of a celebrated book, Born in Blood defending Freemasonry and blasting its critics, also referenced the Grand Hailing Sign of Distress sign taught in the 3° ritual: After brief ceremonies, the blindfold is removed, and the newly sworn Master Mason is taught several secrets of that degree. He learns the penal sign, the hand signal based on the penalty of the Master Mason's oath, which is to pass the hand in a slashing motion, palm downward and thumb toward the body, across his stomach. The due-guard of the Master Mason repeats the position of his hands on the Holy Bible and the compass and square as he takes the oath: with his upper arms along his sides, forearms out straight, with palms down. To this point, the ceremony is much like that of the first two degrees, but now is added a third sign, the Grand Hailing Sign of Distress of the Master Mason, given with the upper arms parallel to the ground, forearms vertical with hands above the head, palms forward. For those times when the Master Mason is out of sight of possible help, or in the dark, he is taught to summon assistance with the word, \"O Lord, my God, is there no help for a Son of the Widow?\" a reference to Hiram, legendary master craftsman at the building of the Temple of Solomon, about whom the initiate has yet been told nothing, and whom Masons identify with the metalworker that scripture describes as \"a son of a widow of Naphtali.\" 5 Note that Robinson makes mention of the \"penal sign, the hand signal based on the penalty of the Master Mason's oath.\" In Codex Magica, you will see several examples of this signal, including a photo of Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin and one of former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. In his book Freemasonry, Jack Harris, a former Master Mason who renounced the Order after converting to Christianity, quotes at length the ritual according to the State of Maryland's Masonic Manual. 6 That manual assures the Mason that at his death, if his good works are sufficient, \"a kind messenger from the Supreme Grand Master will be sent to translate us to that all perfect, glorious and celestial lodge above, where the Supreme Architect of the Universe presides.\" According to Harris the ritual continues as follows: All officers and members bow toward the East. The Master raps the lodge down (1 rap). Also explained to the brother in the third degree lecture is what he is to do in times of peril or danger.

At times when this sign could not be seen, such as in the dark, a spoken signal is substituted: \"O Lord, My God, is there no help for the widow's son?\" A Mason hearing these words would be equally bound to flee to the brother's rescue if there were more probability of saving his life than losing his own life. 7"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"182 CODEX MAGICA Mikhail Gorbachev, Soviet President and Chairman of the Communist Party, visits the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) in New York City.

They also conspired to overthrow the elaborate FBI and intelligence network historically run behind the scenes by the Jewish-led Illuminati chieftains. Nixon knew what he was risking.

The Illuminati elite use it to this day to symbolize key phenomena and mark significant events. The mysterious letter X seems to take on a wide and varied life of its own, with or without the secret aid of the elite sponsorship. Mark Euston, of the Christian Intelligence Resource Network, in a letter to the author, detailed some of the many examples of the use of the letter X. For example, the well-known science fiction TV show, The X Files. Pornographic movies are rated X and the more sensational movies in the raw flesh category are touted as XXX, or triple X. Euston noted that we have the Microsoft Corporation creation of X-box, the movie X-Men, off-brand products are called \"Brand X,\" and of course, there is the U.S. terrorist prison camp, Camp X- Ray at Guantanamo, Cuba. Today's youth have been called Generation X, and a lot of"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"206 CODEX MAGICA folks are concerned about a planet, or star, reported to be speeding toward us called Planet X that has occult significance. Euston asks about all the usages of X, \"Are these just strange coincidences, some type of mind control trigger, or a subliminal conditioning of some kind?\" Good question. Another friend, Kathy Creek, wrote and asked if I had noticed the many new drugs being released by pharmaceutical firms with either a V, Z, or an X in their name? She mentioned an ad she had seen for Clarinex, an allergy drug that had a little sun sign used to dot the letter \"i\" in Clarinex. John Myers, another astute friend interested in such topics, sent me a lengthy letter and included an excerpt from author Edward Waite's reference book, A New Encyclopedia of Freemasonry. Myers wryly observed that, \"generally, things that are bad are X-rated.\" He mentioned, too, the interesting use of the letter X in the Rx of drug stores; the use of the four-letter, abbreviated word Xmas to replace Christmas, and the fact that, in Black's Law Dictionary, it says that the sign or mark of X is sometimes made as a substitute for a man's signature on legal documents. And the continued use of the mysterious X abounds. Children at play can be heard to say, \"Cross my heart and hope to die.\" In the Greek alphabet, the letter Chi is denoted with the symbol X, and given the numerical designation of 600. The numeroligists say that triple X, then, would yield the number 666. Black Muslim leaders obviously see X as a substitute name of great spiritual significance. Two well-known Black Muslim leaders have been named Malcolm X and Louis X, names they chose for themselves. The latter, who was born Louis Eugene Wolcott in 1933 in New York City, changed his name to Louis X after his conversion to Islam by Black Muslim leader Elijah Muhammed. Today, he is known as Louis Farrakhan. It is well-known that Farrakhan is a 33° Prince Hall Mason. X as Symbol for the Sun God According to Dr. C.J. Koster, head of the Institute for Scripture Research in South Africa, X was the emblem of the Chaldean (Babylonian) sky god. Koster says that X was an ancient symbol of the sun deity and that the letter carried with it sexual connotations. In the old Semitic languages, X represented the cross. 1 Freemasonry early-on latched onto this letter exactly because of its paranormal significance as a sign of Lucifer, the solar (sun) god. The Masonic Lodge also uses X because of its sexual meanings and its Babylonian origins. Writing in the Scottish Rite Journal, the official journal of the Mother Supreme Council, 33°, Jim Tresner discussed the use of X in the ritual ceremony for the 17°, Knight of the East and West. 2 Tresner, a 33rd degree Mason, emphasized that the 17th degree ritual is \"one of the most powerful and profound degrees of the Rite.\" 3 \"Here,\" said Tresner, \"we encounter raw spiritual energy\" and \"we begin to glimpse the spiritual power which is available\" to the person who is able to access it. 4 X as Symbol of Transformation Tresner goes on to suggest that the X, representing the Roman numeral 10, also"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"\"CROSS MY HEART AND HOPE TO DIE\" 207 symbolizes the 10 yuds, or mani- festations, of the Jewish Cabala's Tree of Life (the Sephiroth). He notes that the candidate for this degree wears two cordons, one black in color, the other white, which symbolizes the duality of Masonic doctrine. \"The fact that they cross each other,\" Tresner explains, \"suggests the unions of opposites or equilibrium (Ordo Ab Chao).\" 5 \"In crossing,\" says Tresner, \"they form an X shape.\" X, he observes, \"is an ancient symbol for transformation.\" 6 \"This degree,\" Tresner concludes, \"provides a spiritual jolt or jump-start in preparation for the transformation, refinement, and redefinition to come.\" 7 Tresner chooses his words very carefully...and very deliberately. But Christians who have studied the book of Revelation will intuit and understand what he is hinting at. I believe he is telling the Masonic candidates that this degree, in which the mark of X is prominent, is to prepare them to wage war against true Christians, and to exalt their Man-King as the events prophesied in Bible prophecy roll forward. Naturally, Tresner would probably deny this meaning, so I leave it to you, dear reader, to discern. However, the Masonic author of the authoritative Richardson's Monitor of Freemasonry, no doubt lets the cat out of the bag, so to speak, by detailing how, during this ritual ceremony for the Degree of Knight of the East and West, the Sacred Word is given to the assembled members of the Lodge. That sacred word is a shocker: It is Abaddon. Yes, Abaddon is the Sacred Word for the Masonic Knights of East and West. And the Holy Bible reveals exactly who Abaddon is in Revelation 9:11: Page 158 from Richardson s Monitor of Freemasonry, detailing the ritual ceremony of the Knights of the East and West. In this ritual, the sacred word Abaddon is expressed. Abaddon is a synonym for the name of the Devil who leads millions of demons out of the pit of hell to torment earth in the last days. And they had a king over them, which is the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon, but in the Creek tongue hath his name Apollyon. In Richardson's Monitor of Freemasonry it is revealed that, following the announcement of the sacred word, Abaddon, the Lodge drama for this fateful degree provides a demonstration \"intended to represent the end of the world.\" 8"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"208 CODEX MAGICA How very appropriate. How very telling! X Symbol in the Masonic Lodge One thing is for sure: The Masonic Order uses the X not only for the revelatory 17th degree of Knights of East and West, but for others as well. In the Royal Arch's Super-Excellent Master's Degree, the First Sign given is the crossing of the hands over the breast/chest. This sign refers to the penalty assessed if any secrets learned are ever divulged. Then, in the ritual ceremony for the Select Master Degree, the Second Sign is made by crossing the hands and arms just below the neck and dropping them downward quickly. Again, this is a reminder of the disclosure penalty, which is to have the body butchered and quartered. In the ritual for the Intimate Secretary Degree, an X pattern is employed. Richardson's Monitor of Freemasonry reveals what happens in the Lodge: The brethren now fall, each on his right knee, and they cross their hands and hold them up so that the thumb of the right hand touches the left temple, and the left thumb the right temple... 9 The X as Tumbling Cross and Sex Symbol In ancient India, the X symbol was equated with the vajra (jewel-phallus). Probably, this is yet another reason why the Masonic Lodge adopted this symbol for many of their ritual activities. Masonry is, in fact, a deviant sex cult. In her interesting encyclopedia called The Woman's Dictionary of Symbols and Sacred Objects, Barbara Walker calls the symbol the \"Cross Saltire\" which means literally \"tumbling cross\" or a cross performing a somersault. In this sense, it is decidedly anti-Christ in nature. The Church of Scientology, New Age in its beliefs, has as its logo a traditional cross (vertical) integrated with an X, or Cross Saltire. This is understandable since Scientology is unquestionably non-Christian. X as Sign of Death Finally, as if to signify the somber, ghastly meaning of the letter X in Freemasonry ritual, pomp and circumstance, it should be noted that upon his death, when the departed Mason's body is given a Masonic funeral by the assembled brethren, with his immediate family in attendance, the X again comes into play. The Monitor of the Work, Lectures, and Ceremonies of Ancient Craft Masonry for the Grand Lodge of the State"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"\"CROSS MY HEART AND HOPE TO DIE\" 209 of New York in part describes the ritual and scene prescribed for funerals as follows: The funeral honors are given by extending the hands toward the grave with the palms up, the brethren repeating in unison: 'To the grave we consign the mortal remains of our deceased brother.' The arms are then crossed over the breast, the left above the right, the fingers touching the shoulders... 10 You'll find among the photos and illustrations in this section one of horror novelist Stephen King seeming to emulate exactly this funeral procedure of crossing the arms (X), the fingers touching the opposite shoulder. Is King, the master of death literature, in fact taking on the image of death, the grim reaper? Does King believe that this publicly displayed ritual act by him confers on the famous novelist the \"raw spiritual energy\" mentioned by Masonic authority Jim Tresner, 33°? X—The Egyptian Connection From what source do the Masons draw for this funeral symbolism of the X? In my book, Dark Majesty, I explain the Egyptian connection: In ancient Egypt, the mark of \"X\" and the symbol of cross-bones in the symbol of an X was very prominent in religious contexts. You can find the X on the walls of a number of ancient Egyptians temples and pyramids...It is the sign of Osiris, the great sun god... The ancient pharaohs, when they were buried, had the legs crossed in the form of \"X\" as a sign of devotion to Osiris.'' Today, as in ancient Egypt, Osiris the sun god is worshipped; now the homage and veneration comes from the Masons and their fellow Illuminists. These confused and perverted men mistakenly believe they are illumined (enlightened) by their solar deity, the Great Architect, Jahbuhlun, or Lucifer. They have even arranged for Osiris' watchful eye, the all-seeing eye, to be pictured on each and every U.S.A. one dollar bill. It is the eye in the capstone surrounded by the rays of the sun announcing to the whole world the coming of a New Age, a New World Order (Novus Ordo Seclorum). What a grand surprise these wicked men have in store for them when Jesus Christ, Lord of Lords, returns. II Thessalonians 2 says that the opposers of Christ—the leaders of Illuminati and their hordes of rapt followers — shall be utterly destroyed by the brightness of His coming. Until that great and momentous day, the pitiful men of the Illuminati shall continue to wallow with each other in the mire and muck. They will continue communicating the sign of X, the sign of their silly, fanciful god, all the while cursing the darkness rather than lighting a candle.

And they have developed an equally insane \"scientific\" system, designed to reprogram and recreate social material and spiritual reality to fit their perverted, upside down theology. Universal Motion: Alchemy and Magic Their scientific system, actually a form of witchcraft, is based on alchemy and magic. Its process is one of Universal Motion, designed to purposely foment diabolical chaos so that order may come out of two dynamic competing forces, Ordo Ah Chao. Their objective is the Great Work, the changing of man created in God's image into the image of a serpent-being void of morality and void of righteous, just values. In other words, the Great Work is designed to create and produce a race of soul-less satanic creatures. To effect their Great Work, to transform and transmutate the world and humanity into the \"new soul-less creature,\" heaven and earth must be destroyed, crushed, and thoroughly converted into a new paradigm. In essence, heaven and earth are to become hell. The will of Satan shall be done on Earth as it is in hell. This is the exalted, \"Royal Secret.\" It is the Illuminati's core doctrine, their cardinal teaching, that out of bloody, universal chaos will ultimately come equilibrium and the Holy Empire of the Illuminati, to be ruled by their cabalistic Messiah, or King—actually the Antichrist. Pike revealed this ultimate objective to subordinate Illuminists on page 861 of his celebrated textbook, Morals and Dogma: The Royal Secret, of which you are a Prince, if you are a true adept...is that which the Sohar (an occultic and cabalistic text) terms The Mystery of the Balance.

His body was not of flesh but was made up of actual gems and jewels. Even more fantastic, musical instruments were incorporated into his being. A beauty to behold. But then the deceitful Lucifer rebelled, taking down with him one third of the angels. He and they apparently became vile creatures, ugly and deformed, appearing in grotesque forms appropriate to their mental and spiritual deformities.

Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit. (Isaiah 14:12-15) The Bible says that the angry and furious fallen Lucifer now walks to and fro in the earth like a lion seeking whom he might devour. His aim is to ruin God's creation, to bastardize and corrupt it, to change it into what he is—a monumentally ugly and warped creation, totally opposite of what God intended. Man and the world must be ruined, destroyed, transformed into a barren, non-producing, hideously shaped wasteland. Men are to be made feminine; women masculine. Marriage is to be perverted. No longer between man and woman, it shall be used also to join men with men and women to women. Abortion —the reckless slaughter of innocents —is to be applauded. Sex is to become rife with perversion. Children are given over to the terrible passions of lustful pedophiles. Spiritual values are converted to material desires. False gods are exalted. False Bibles are invented. Murder and assassination become religious goals. The Christian seeks as his life goal to become more and more like Jesus. But man and the world are progressively becoming more like Satan and his dark angels — more corrupt and evil every day, in every way. Evolution, oddly, becomes fact, except that man isn't evolving from apes, he is becoming an ape. He is transferred into base animal, devoid of God's values, without the mind of Christ, but instead filled with instincts and ambitions of pride, lust, murder, and envy. As Above, So Below This, then, is the end-goal of Illuminism: To destroy earth, debase civilization, end pure spirituality, induce chaos on earth, and bring order according to Satan's Illuminati script. Earth is to be hell and hell on earth: As Above, So Below. This is the meaning of the double-headed Eagle; the androgynous joining of man and woman; the mixing of the yin and yang; the checkerboard, black and white floors of the Masonic Lodges; the mirror images of the Rosicrucians; the sulphurous tale of Beauty and the Beast; the witches parable of the lovely lady vs. the crone on her broom; the Druid/Satanic/Catholic alternating of black and white priest vestments; the front and obverse (hidden) sides of the Great Seal of the United States; the reversing of the cross and the reading of the Lord's Prayer backwards in satanic worship, ad naseum. All fields, all things, must be reversed. Negative must be transmuted into positive. Bad will be good. Black shall be white. The ugly shall be adjudged beautiful and the beautiful is to be spoiled, scarred, and made repugnant and revolting. God shall be debased and Satan exalted. Illuminism, therefore, is a system of dualism (thesis and antithesis) which cyclically repeats as synthesis results. Then, the conflicting forces of the duality cycle clash again, with synthesis being achieved once more.

Ever upward, evolving until perfection. So, the Illuminist is a perfectionist ever changing, seeking more light as he travels down that yellow brick road to tomorrow. As Bill and Hillary Clinton's favorite song intoned, \"Don't stop thinking about tomorrow.\" \"Everything must change,\" was the slogan of the Illuminists who sparked the French Revolution. 2 The Illuminists ruling America give us two political parties, Democrat and Republican (thesis and antithesis), both of which they control. But the conflict of these two opposites never leads to a real solution, only to a fluid, sketchy, \"synthesis.\" Problems are never completely and satisfactorily resolved. The dualistic process is never ending. We are all citizens of \"Neverneverland,\" and we don't even know it. The Third Side to Every Issue Here's how one Illuminist philosopher, satanic priest Anton LaVey, explained it: There are not always 'two sides to every issue.' That statement is a ridiculous slogan invoked by vested interests... In matters of significant concern, there is invariably another alternative: a THIRD SIDE, a satanic side. 'Two sides of the same coin' is what most major issues are artfully constructed to be. Subsequently, the populace lives by imperceptible Hobson's choices masquerading as opposing opinions. The two uppermost points of the inverted pentagram of Satan represent the dualistic nature of all things, as all things are naturally perceived. Man has always been motivated and controlled by whatever dualistic concept is in fashion, and always will be. Like it or not, it's the way things really are. Shades of gray only appear between established opposites. 3 The Rosicrucian Orders and the Masonic Lodge incessantly teach this duality of all things in their rituals and lectures. In the book, The Rose Cross and the Goddess, Masonic advocate, Gareth Knight, speaks of this \"dual polarity.\" In Masonic symbolism, Knight observes, this duality is expressed by the square and compass. 4 One of the highest degree rituals in Scottish Rite Freemasonry is that which honors the Emperors of the East and West. It is symbolized, among other things, by the Masonic double-headed eagle. Two heads, one body. Again: duality.

It is a universal agent, whose Supreme law is equilibrium...it was adored in the secret rites of the Sabbat or the Temple under the hieroglyphic figure of Baphomet or the hermaphroditic goat of Mendes... There is a Life-Principle of the world, a universal agent, wherein are two natures and a double current...It is the body of the Holy Spirit, the Universal Agent, the Serpent devouring his own tail...Force attracts force... 5 The Jewish cabalists speak in mysterious, guarded terms of this same potent Force. They say it is produced from the uniting of the two triangles, male and female, in the sex act, releasing the generative energy of creation. The result symbolized is, of course, the Jewish Star of David, known as the Seal, or symbol, of Solomon or simply as the Six-Pointed Star. The cabalists say this Star represents the combined energy of good and evil becoming one Force; it represents the \"white Jehovah and the black Jehovah.\" It is the epitome of the \"As Above, So Below\" doctrine. As LaVey put it, it represents \"THE THIRD WAY.\" To the Illuminati, nothing is static, everything is deceit; the Force is dynamic, ever-changing, the quicksand of light that diffuses and reappears only to disappear again. Dark is Light and Light is Dark and no one can divine a difference. Satan is therefore God and God is Satan, and the Serpent chases its own tail. Forever. The Invisible Light This is all insanity, of course, but to the Illuminist it is Reason. Thus, Francis Adams Moore, in the Lucis Trust publication, The Beacon, wrote an article entitled '\"The Invisible Sun.\" In it, Moore speaks of \"The Ageless Wisdom\": The Ageless Wisdom teaches that this darkness out of which visible Light came, is actually the pure Light —the Light that is so brilliant, radiant, and transcendent it appears as darkness to the form world. 6 To Moore, what we perceive as darkness is actually invisible Light. In all creation, he says, light and darkness are mixed and \"their equilibrium is the mystery of mysteries.\" 7 Once again we see the Illuminists' insane doctrine of duality. The bisexual is preferred, bad is good, and so on. Duality and synthesis, and more duality and synthesis, in never-ending incarnations of confusing light and shadow cycles of unreality blended with reality.

The President noted the carved American eagle on the front of his antique desk, the one used by Ronald Reagan, John F. Kennedy, and Bill Clinton. The head of the eagle, he notes, is turned toward the arrows it holds in its talon.

Notice also that, in Bush's carpet are added a number of brilliant, radiant sun rays arching out from the seal, indicating the \"Illumination\" of the Presidency of the United States. Moreover, at the Bush conference, the positioning of furniture and accessories (chairs/tables) provides the classic Masonic Lodge ritual arrangement, plus we have overall the Mason square and compass within a circle design.

We must remember that President Truman was a 33rd degree Mason. \"Peace\" to a Mason means something entirely different than the same word means to you and me. In fact, to a Mason, peace is defined according to the Hegelian dialectical process of doublemindedness. Thus, the Hegelian motto: \"Perpetual war for perpetual peace.\" What Ms. Noonan also failed to realize is that in turning the two heads of the eagle — one carved on the desk, the other on the rug—in opposite directions, the Illuminati is reproducing, or mimicking, the symbol of the double-headed eagle in Freemasonry. A Ravenous Bird From the East To the Illuminati, the eagle is a symbol of overriding importance and, in its double- headed form, the eagle represents the Illuminati's principal Luciferian doctrine of As Above, So Below. It also represents the Great Work of the Initiation of the World. How prophetic, then, is the Bible verse found in Isaiah 46:11 which reveals that in the last days, a \"ravenous bird from the East\" shall be called forth by God to wreak havoc and destruction on rebellious mankind and the fallen world. So when you see the duality principle (\"As Above, So Below\") represented in the photos and illustrations in this section, remember: You're observing the great secret in operation, the perennial teaching of the Hidden God, the God of the Mysteries, the God who it is said possesses the key to the invisible world (hell), the God of the Arch, the God of cunning, lies and deceit, the two-faced Deity, the Masonic double-headed eagle. In other words, bluntly stated, you are viewing Satan in disguise. Among hard-core occultists deep into Babylonian and Egyptian lore and magic we find the worship of the two-headed Mammon Ra, the God of Prosperity and Riches.

Truly weird, especially, is the fact that there are two sides to the Great Seal. The"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"266 CODEX MAGICA front side pictures a strong, war-ready eagle with a constellation of stars in a cloud above its head. The reverse, the mystical side, is the one with the pyramid, Latin inscriptions, all-seeing eye, etc. Why two sides? After all, a seal is like a rubber stamp. It is used to authenticate documents to prove authenticity and affirm veracity and genuineness. You don't need a reverse side on a \"rubber stamp!\" In fact, both sides of the Great Seal, each with various images, have been around since the days of the Continental Congress. In 1776, just hours after the Declaration of Independence was formally adopted, a committee composed of Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, and John Adams met to design the Great Seal. They invited an artist, Pierre Eugene Du Simitiere, to join them and a design was approved. But the Continental Congress failed to approve it. So, in 1782, Congress called on William Barton, an authority on symbols and heraldry, and Charles Thompson, Secretary of Congress, to help sort out the process. Finally, out came the current day, two-sided Great Seal. 1 Enter Rothschild's Man, Haym Salomon That, of course, is the official version of events. But some claim that a mysterious man from Europe, but living in Philadelphia, named Haym Salomon, secretly assisted the committee of Franklin, Jefferson, and Adams. Haym Salomon, a Jewish banker, just happened to be the American representative for the Rothschilds of Europe. Salomon, it is said, bribed a number of American politicians and was able to get about anything he and his mentors wanted done. In the case of the Great Seal, the Rothschilds wanted symbols to be pictured in the Great Seal of United States befitting the aims of the Illuminati. Though Jewish and Zionist in ambition, the Rothschilds were not worshippers of the God of the Old and New Testaments of the Bible. They were Sabbatian/Frankist (Satanic) in theology. They sought (and still today seek) a Jewish Utopia or Kingdom on planet Earth. This Kingdom would be the New Age successor to ancient Babylon and Egypt. It would be a powerhouse nation that would, through magic and intellect, conquer the world. America would be its proxy. America would be its alter ego.

And so he did. A good portion of the money went to fund the Continental Congress and its operations. Some went into the Treasury for the Revolutionary War effort. Some went into politicians' pockets. Rothschild eventually got the images he had demanded on the Great Seal, though not without opposition. The design was bitterly opposed by the few who recognized the Masonic and Illuminist elements. As for Haym Salomon, few history textbooks mention him. But he is privily called by Illuminati Jews \"The Financier of the American Revolution.\" Only recently, scattered bits of propaganda have begun to be floated about him. A few Jewish books speak of his \"grand accomplishments,\" offering a more cheery and less honest version of his life and his activities as banker for the American Revolution. The ultimate goal of the Illuminati is to eventually bring Haym Salomon out of the closet, so to speak. Someday, his name will be in lights. He'll be immortalized in print, in movies, and on TV as a great and noble hero, akin to a George Washington or Thomas Jefferson. Statues will be built to honor him. One already has, in Philadelphia. Mark my words and mark your calendar for the future and see if what I tell you isn't so. Now, let us examine the symbols on America's Great Seal and see if we can make sense of their true, esoteric meaning and purposes. Let us wipe away the gloss and get down to the base surface to better understand. This is vital because of the future of the United States —and the destiny of all humanity —is wrapped up, and is revealed, in this collection of Illuminist symbols and marks. The Ashlar Stones and The Pyramid Masonry is a peculiar Egypto-Babylonia-Jewish institution, and so the pyramid itself hearkens back to the Dynasty of the pharaohs and to the gods and goddesses of ancient Egypt. The stones which make up the pyramid are also of esoteric significance. In the Masonic philosophy it is taught that unenlightened man is in a rude, natural state. Having little or no \"light\" and without the spiritual illumination offered by the Mystery Religions he is likened to an imperfect or rough ashlar stone. But once enlightened and illuminated, he is crafted into a man of education, sophistication, discipline, and culture. He reaches upward toward spiritual perfection. He is then a perfect ashlar stone. In many pagan religions this concept of the Rough vs. Perfect Ashlar was taught. In Freemasonry, it is heavily emphasized. The pyramid's structure is fitted only with perfect ashlar stones, it is said, meticulously chosen by \"The Builders\" who watch for flaws and reject the rough, or imperfect ashlar. Likewise, the higher level Masons discover that the pyramid reflects, or parallels, the New World Order (Novus Ordo Seclorum) they and their Illuminized superiors are building under the watchful eye of the Great Architect of the Universe, whose secret and sacred name, the Royal Arch Mason learns, is Jahbuhlun. The Builders (the Perfect Ashlars), then, are the Illuminati and their minions. Their building project is the renovation and reconstruction (Perestroika or Tikkun"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"268 CODEX MAGICA Olam) of the whole earth. Of course, in order to build the New Deal of the Ages, they must first tear down the old. Civilization as we know it today must be razed and destroyed by dialectic chaos, so that the new order may be ushered in: Ordo Ab Chao It is when this ambitious goal is achieved that, symbolically, the capstone will be set in place atop the pyramid. Then he who lies within the living stones shall come forth to rule. The Phoenix (Satan and his \"son\") shall rise from the flames of destruction just as the legendary phoenix bird arose. The Phoenix, however, is, in reality a cockatrice, a dragon-bird, a flying serpent. The word \"pyramid,\" incidentally, literally means \"amidst the fire.\" And now you know the true, occultic meaning of the word. Peering Into the All-Seeing Eye Simply put, Freemasons, under the direction of Haym Salomon, Ben Franklin, and others, designed the Great Seal with its all-seeing eye in the capstone amidst the radiant sun background. As followers of Egyptianism, it has long been assumed that the eye is that of Osiris, the Egyptian sun god, and/or of his son, Horus. This is true, but there is much more. Osiris, of course, was worshipped as the Sun. Albert Pike, former Sovereign Grand Commander, wrote: \"The sun...is the All-Seeing Eye in our Lodges.\" 2 Pike goes on to say that, \"the Blazing Star (the pentagram deity) has been recognized as an emblem of Omniscience, or the All-Seeing Eye, which to the Ancients was the Sun.\" 3 The Illuminati and their subordinates, the Masons, honor the Deity of countless names. Yes, one of those names is Osiris, with his son Horus. But the Illuminati Deity is a concealed god who hides his true identity in a multitude of disguises and subterfuges. He is called \"The Sun,\" the \"Central Sun,\" \"Hiram Abiff,\" the one with the \"Ineffable Name,\" \"Ein Soph,\" the \"Great Architect of the Universe,\" \"Abaddon,\" \"Mahabone,\" and \"Jahbuhlun.\" Ostensibly the Illuminati worship a pantheon, a multiplicity of gods. But, not so. These are all fronts for the elite worship of Lucifer. He is their true god, the God of Light. As Albert Pike stated in Morals and Dogma, \"Doubt it not.\" Their God is The Serpent Now, the Bible, in Isaiah 14 and Revelation 12:9, identifies Lucifer as \"the great dragon...that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world.\" So, by whatever name you call him, the god of the Illuminati and Masonry is the Serpent. In fact, in A Bridge to Light, an official textbook of the Supreme Mother Council, 33°, the highest council of the Scottish Rite, Rex Hutchens, 33°, reveals that \"the body of the Holy Spirit, the universal agent,\" is none other than \"the Serpent devouring his own tail.\" 4 That is, the Oroboros serpent. Remember, in all their writings, the most revered of Masonic scholars — Manly P. Hall, Albert Mackey, Albert Pike, etc.—claim that the Masonic rituals and teachings come from the \"mysteries\" of ancient Babylonians, Egyptians, Greeks, Persians and others.

Pember: \"There is little doubt that the culmination of the mysteries was the worship of Satan himself.\" 5 You'll also recall our discussion elsewhere in this book that the Illuminist and Masonic theology is solidly based on the Jewish Cabala (Kaballah or Quaballah). Indeed, almost all occult and magical belief systems are founded on the principles and teachings of the Jewish Cabala. In her most famous book, The Secret Doctrine, Helena Blavatsky praised Satan as the teacher of humanity. 6 He is to be thanked, Blavatsky says, for setting men on the path to divinity and liberty. It is, she emphasizes, the Cabala that \"unveils the secret.\" To what secret is she referring? Listen, as Blavatsky flatly states the core doctrine of the mysteries, of occultism, of Illuminism: The Great Serpent of the Garden of Eden and the Lord God are identical. 7 Ah, we have here the reality of supreme evil in this core teaching. Paul knew of this mystery teaching, he wrote of the \"Mystery of Iniquity\" and said of the ancient religionists, that they \"knew God, but glorified Him not as God,\" and changed the Glory of God \"into the likeness of creeping things\" — that is, serpents (Romans 1:23). The Devourer of Self Barbara Walker, researcher of occultism and paganism, writes: As Lord of Death, Osiris was sometimes identified with the Great Serpent of the underworld, and sometimes was painted in the same serpentine form, bent around so his toes touched his head. 8 The serpent, or Satan, as we know from the scriptures, is god of the dead. Indeed, God says, \"all they that hate me love death\" (Proverbs 8:36). He is Lord alright, but only of death, of the underworld, and of planet earth for a season (II Thessalonians 2). He is graphically pictured in the occult world as a serpent biting his own tail; how appropriate: A devourer of himself! And that is what actually happens when a person defies God and worships the Adversary. He or she is \"biting his own tail\" — tragically and pathetically devouring himself. The Oroboros The oroboros, or serpent biting its own tail, is pictured on the cover of Codex Magica. This book unmasks the Illuminati worship of this detestable creature, a worship of which virtually every person on earth is dangerously and hopelessly unaware. Since the Illuminati, Masons, and fellow cabalists have amassed such tremendous political, financial, social, and technological powers, is it not a frightening thing to realize that these men are not only religious, their religion is Satanism, and their god is the Devil?

As I have proven over and over by a preponderance of documentation, we cannot separate the murderous goals and activities of the Illuminati from their religious belief system. Their inspiration, their fanatical zealotry, comes from their teacher, Satan, who has given them a thorough set of instructions—an Unholy Bible if you will, in the Jewish Cabala. In this Unholy Bible, the Serpent plays the key role. He is praised as the \"Serpent of Wisdom.\" The destiny of the Illuminati and the whole world is said to be in his hands. We thank God that all who believe in Christ Jesus have no part of this destiny. Jesus said He has chosen us out of the world. We are pilgrims, aliens on earth, spiritually residing in heavenly places.

In the York Rite initiation for the Royal Master's Degree, this sign, called the Due-guard, \"is made by placing the forefinger of the right hand upon the lips.\" 2 Richardson's Monitor of Freemasonry remarks that this sign \"is a caution to a companion when you wish him to keep silent.\" 3 In the ritual degree ceremony of the Secret Master, the candidate places two fingers to his lip and is told that the obligation he is taking \"enjoins secrecy and to"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"\"SILENCE, SLAVES, OR WE'LL CUT YOUR THROAT FROM EAR TO EAR!\" 287 Richardson's Monitor of Freemasonry (pp. 142-143) provides these bloody reminders of the horrible penalties that await the Mason or other elitist who divulges secrets of the Order. \"Silence, Slaves\" is certainly the catchword for the submissive servants of Satan's earthly elite corps of leaders. obey the orders and decrees of the Council of Princes of Jerusalem, under penalties of all former degrees.\" 4 For the fifth degree (Past Master) the penal dueguard sign is the placement of the thumb to one's mouth, again indicating the warning to keep silent. A Softening of Penalties? Freemasonry and many other secret societies have been under siege in recent years as the author of Codex Magica and a number of other courageous men have boldly come forward exposing the frightening, cold and bloody oaths taken by millions of Masons around the globe. As a consequence, as I understand it, the leadership of the Lodge and other groups has more recently begun to \"soften the edges,\" so to speak and to eliminate some of the more egregious and ghastly phrases and words used in the rituals. In June 2001, according to The Scottish Rite Journal, C. Fred Kleinknecht, Sovereign Grand Commander, 33°, the reigning potentate of Freemasonry, presented copies of the Revised Standard Pike Ritual to his subordinate Sovereign Grand Commanders. 5 Kleinknecht explained to his lieutenants that this new guide provides \"modified"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"288 CODEX MAGICA versions\" of the seventh and twenty-seventh degrees which were originally created by Albert Pike, their much revered nineteenth century \"Illustrious Sovereign Grand Master.\" 6 One can assume that to appease its critics, further editions of the ritual will water down the most grievous of the penalties. Other ways, however, will undoubtedly be found to motivate the membership to keep the secrets, including banishment from elite status and possibly even the periodic assassination of disciples who stray and who recklessly disregard the dictate to retain secrecy. Still it is of interest that the Masonic elite are embarrassed over being outed for their hideous oaths. What's more, in the Mormon Church (LDS), the penalty portions of the Masonic-oriented rituals celebrated in the Temple also have recently been watered down somewhat. It sure seems as though the big-wigs of the secret orders are running scared, doesn't it? How they must despise Christians like Texe Marrs who are forcing these changes on a reluctant and evil Illuminati corps. Pagan Origins of the Sign of Silence The Masonic practice of signs warning of frightening penalties for breaking silence most definitely is of pagan origins. In Greece, Rome, Babylon, and Egypt, those who had loose lips often paid with their lives and fortunes, so sacred and guarded were the secrets of the Mystery Religions. The Egyptians and Romans even worshipped a god of silence, Harpocrates, a form of the solar deity. Harpocrates was often pictured sitting on his mother's lap, suckling at her breast. Later, the Catholic Church adopted similar images in the veneration of Mary with child. Sometimes Harpocrates was pictured naked or with horns on his head, symbols of power. He often sat on a Lotus flower. The Lotus is a sexual symbol of the female vagina. 7"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"\"SILENCE, SLAVES, OR WE'LL CUT YOUR THROAT FROM EAR TO EAR!\" 289 In the active days of Benjamin Franklin and our nation's founders, their secret society counterparts in Great Britain made use of the god Harpocrates. Sir Francis Dashwood, instrumental in the British operation of the Illuminati, recruited nobility for his Hell-Fire Club, a secret group based on magic, satanism, and sex. Numerous harlots—and sometimes newly deflowered virgins—were scandalously used by Dashwood and his occultic, jolly men. On club premises, the members erected a statue of Harpocrates, depicting him solemnly holding a finger to his mouth to remind the frolicking members of the Hell-Fire Club that, \"What happens here, stays here.\" 8 Rome also had the Mystery Goddess Angerona. Her statue showed Angerona as a beautiful woman holding a finger to her mouth, \"the emblem of secrecy and mystery.\" 9 Angerona watched over the sexual promiscuity goings-on at various orgies connected with the festivals of the solstices and the changing of the seasons. The Mystery Religions of the Romans and other peoples especially needed the utmost secrecy because, during the higher initiations, the unspoken names of the hidden or unknown god, or gods, was often revealed. As the Christians gained in numbers and influence, they began to properly understand that these names were actually synonyms for Satan, Lucifer, the Devil. Great effort was therefore taken by pagans to obscure or prevent the unmasking of this satanic connection. 10 An interesting sidenote: As a child watching TV in the early days (1950s), one of the most popular programs was a game show hosted by Jewish comedian Groucho Marx. Groucho had a brother, Harpo Marx, who was also a comedian and starred in numerous TV programs and in movies. Harpo always played the cherubic character of a mute young boy, with blond hair in curls. In other words, Harpo was cast in the image of Harpocrates, god of silence and secrecy, also known as Horus the child."},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"290 CODEX MAGICA"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"\"SILENCE, SLAVES, OR WE'LL CUT YOUR THROAT FROM EAR TO EAR!' 291"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"292 CODEX MAGICA Lawrence Summers, President of Harvard University and former Secretary of the Treasury under President Bill Clinton.

Well, it is definitely applicable to the Illuminist elite and their legion of secret society puppets.

In the York Rite, the Past Master, or Fifth Degree, the candidate places the thumb of his right hand (fingers clinched) upon his lips.

Th e Egyptian Book of the Dead addressed prayers to \"My heart of my mother...My heart of transformations,\" meaning the source of rebirths. The Mother Goddess of Egypt was worshipped by various names — Isis, Hathor, Rhea, etc. She was the one to whom the people \"gave their hearts,\" meaning their heart-felt devotion and allegiance. As the Goddess of sacrifices, it was deemed necessary by her admirers that men should sacrifice their \"energies\" on her behalf. The Goddess was said to take possession of men's hearts. Cutting Out Hearts and Eating Them! In the pyramids of Mexico, Central and South America, the gods were also gods of sacrifice and, once again, the heart was the centerpiece of devotion. Bloodthirsty followers, egged on by high priests, cut out the hearts of victims of tribal wars. On the stone altars of the temples, the priests cut the heart out of the breast of sacrificial victims while they were still alive! The hearts were eaten, just as they were in ancient Egypt and as they are in a number of satanic cults in existence today. Back to Egypt Freemasonry today freely admits its connection to the religion and rituals of ancient Egypt and proudly displays Egyptian idols (the Sphinx, etc.) in and around its lodge facilities and at its international headquarters, the House of the Temple in Washington, D.C. Moreover, in the ritual ceremonies of the higher Masonic degrees, the Hindu pantheon of deities is honored as the true \"Holy Trinity.\" 1 In the Hindu religion, the whole universe is said to be centered in the heart.

Devotion to the Secret Chiefs Within the Illuminati structure, the initiate is taught in no uncertain terms that he must devote his whole heart to the \"secret chiefs,\" the top elite who comprise the Inner Circle. His life must be dedicated to the goals they have set, for they, in turn, are being directed by the Hierarchy, the spirit beings (Satan and his demons) who have given them Th e Plan. In other words, the life of every Illuminist is a divine temple, and through ritual, magic, and loyal devotion the Great Work of alchemical transformation is to be accomplished within the individual heart and within the world at large. Ordo Ab Chao — order must come out of chaos. A Number of Meanings As the evidence points out in the illustrations in this section, the \"hand on heart\" sign has a number of meanings, depending particularly on the exact placement of the hand and the positioning of the fingers. As always, the left hand on heart indicates the sinister occultic path. The thumb extended upward leaving the hand squared in the \"L\" position signals fidelity, sincerity and being \"on the square.\" The thumb upward symbolizes the child-soul, the heart in subjection to higher powers. The sign of Hand on Heart is practiced and taught in the rituals for many degrees of Freemasonry. For example: • In the Degree of Sublime Knights Elected, the candidate is instructed in the sign. His right hand is extended across the chest to the heart and the thumb is pointed upward. (Richardson's Monitor of Freemasonry, p. 147) • In the Degree of Companion Select, the sign is given with the right hand. (Richardson's Monitor of Freemasonry, p. 86) • In the Degree of Select Master, the initiate is told \"The most popular signs in Masonry are made in this manner: Place the palm of the right hand on the heart, and pronounce the word SECRESY.\" (Richardson's Monitor of Freemasonry, p. 80) • In the Degree of the Knight of the Pelican and Eagle Sovereign Prince Rose Croix of Heredom, the lecturer directs the assembled members to \"pass to the Black Room, 18° collars being reversed.\" Following this instruction, the sign of \"right hand on left breast is given.\" (18th Degree Secret Initiation Ceremony) • In the Degree of Mark Master, the members form and march around the Lodge, singing a song. The words of the song include the following: \"Mark Masters all appear Before the Chief Overseer... You who have passed the square, For your rewards prepare, Join heart and hand...Wages to you are due, At your command.\" (Duncan's Masonic Ritual and Monitor, p. 161)"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"HAND ON HEART 309 Separation of Fingers as Sign is Given Separating the fingers has its own interpretation, often being the sign of choice for cabalists who employ the letters of the Hebrew alphabet in their hand on heart communications.

Both of these historical characters were members of secret cabalistic orders founded by the rabbis of the Jewish Sanhedrin. Erasing Confusion The Illuminist/Masonic sign should not be confused with the American custom of placing one's hand over the heart while reciting the Pledge of Allegiance to the flag (Citizens of some other nations practice this same tradition). Again, in judging the Illuminist intent, we look to such factors as time period, the history and affiliations, who's performing the sign, and other factors.

On TV, and in art, architecture, product design, advertising, commercial packaging, and in religion it is ubiquitous. I am convinced that this simple, yet profound device, the triangle, somehow has a mystical, mesmerizing effect on men's minds. The never-ending blizzard of triangle designs we encounter daily is intended to induce a trance state in those who are bombarded day and night by it. Back to Babylon For an answer why the triangle may be the ultimate satanic symbol for Illuminists we go back in time to uncover its origins. A book on mathematics history called Early Computations tells us that \"A Babylonian tablet dated around 1900 BC to 1600 BC and called 'Plimpton 322' deals with Pythagorean triplets.\" This ancient document detailed an elementary knowledge of triangles and proportions. The Triangle as Woman's \"Holy Door'' Barbara Walker, in her The Woman's Encyclopedia of Myths and Secrets, outlines how the ancient Mystery Religions greatly honored the triangle as the sign of deity. She notes that the Hindus, too, borrowed this emblem as their tantric (sexual) female Triangle of Life. It was known as the Kali Yantra, sign of the female vulva. In Egypt, the triangle was a hieroglyphic sign for \"woman.\" In ancient Greece, the sexual intent is clear in that the triangle represented the Holy Door, genitalia of the All-Mother Demeter, known as \"Mother Delta.\" 1 \"The triangle was everywhere connected with the female trinity, and a frequent component of monograms of goddesses,\" writes Walker. 2 It is easily understood, therefore, why the gay homosexual movement adopted the sign of the pink triangle as its emblem. For male homosexuals particularly, the goddess image and feminine archetype were powerful motivators dictating"},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"328 CODEX MAGICA adaptation of the triangle as symbol of \"gay liberation.\" To occultists, the triangle pointing upward represents fire and that pointing downward water. To combine, balance, and unite the two brings dualism, or equilibrium, which is a goal of Freemasonry and a cardinal tenet of all Illuminist religious systems. The Pope's Triceps The Vatican also got into the triangle act. In some Roman Catholic churches today, behind the altar we find displayed the all-seeing eye inside a triangle. Meanwhile, the Pope can often be seen wearing the symbol of the triceps on his vestments or on his Dagon Fish God hat, which has its own unique triangular design. The triceps is a Nordic design of three earth diamonds thought to invoke earth energy powers and spiritual magic. By adding straight lines on its three sides to fill in the open spaces, we discover that the Triceps unexpectedly becomes a larger triangle with a concealed Jewish Star of David (six-pointed star) within. The Triangle and Freemasonry Many erroneously believe that Freemasonry is a Christian religion and may be misled into thinking that the prominent use of the triangle in its rituals and its display of icons has a Christian purpose. But in his book, A Bridge to Light, an official Scottish Rite publication of the Supreme Mother Council, 33°, Rex Hutchins, 33° explains that the triangle of the Masonic Lodge represents pagan religions as well and he especially cites the Hindu trinity of gods, Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva. 3 I have mentioned elsewhere that a triangle symbol containing a letter \"Y\" inside which divides it internally into three triangles is called the Eye of the Dragon, or Dragon's Eye. Since Freemasonry has its all-seeing eye which represents Satan, the Dragon, again we have a connection. The Triangle and Astrology In astrology we find the concept of the grand trine, which is considered very, very lucky. Joan Quigley, astrologer to movie stars and to President Ronald Reagan and First Lady Nancy Reagan, says that, \"the grand trine is formed by three planets approximately 120 degrees apart. When you see this sign in the planets when forecasting their horoscope, you know they are about to hit (figuratively) a \"grand slam home run.\" 4 Quigley illustrates the grand trine in her book, What Does Joan Say?-My Seven"},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"TRIANGLES UP, TRIANGLES DOWN, TRIANGLES, TRIANGLES ALL AROUND 329 Years As White House Astrologer to Nancy and Ronald Reagan. 5 As it turns out, the astrological symbol for a grand trine is a triangle inside a circle. This is the same symbol configuration adapted by Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) founder Bill Wilson to be the official logo of AA. My extensive research of Bill Wilson's life documents he was an occultist. He despised Christianity and adopted AA's concept of worship of an unnamed \"Higher Power\" to substitute for Jesus. Wilson came up with the logo for AA from a dream he had in which he saw the image of the triangle within a circle and knew it was to become the logo for AA. 6 Do the llluminati Secretly Worship the Great Goddess? It is interesting that in the Jewish Cabala, we again find use of the triangle as a feminine vulva sign. Of the ten Sephiroth, the third Sephira, or Triad, is deemed of feminine potency.

Well, now you know. America, meet your satanic mistress, Isis. —Texe Marrs The triangle is of primary importance in all Illuminati realms, whether in the ritual ceremonies of the Rosicrucians and Masons or the witchcraft, astrological and black magic practices of other Illuminist followers. Always the triangle is used. Among satanists and witches, the double triangle, the Seal of Solomon, also called the hexagram, is of great interest. This seal, known as the Magen David of the Jews, is actually composed of two triangles, superimposed on each other. One triangle pointed upward represents the flesh or material matter and the male generative act; the other, pointed downward, signifies female sexuality and the spiritual plane. Therefore we have a masculine and a feminine triangle integrated. This indicates sexual union, the sex act, and the reconciliation of opposites, yin and yang, or God and Satan. The blasphemous suggestion in the symbol becomes clear. Remember: Everywhere in the world of Illuminism, we discover sexual connotations. Theirs is a sex cult; indeed it is the world's greatest sex cult; yet, the Illuminati use symbols and signs to mask their sexually perverted messages."},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"362 CODEX MAGICA The Star of David and the Beast's Number, 666 The supremely evil nature of the double triangle, the hexagram, Solomon's Seal, the Magen David (Shield of David), is proven by the fact that the symbol contains the hidden number 666, the number of the beast (Revelation 13). Notice that there are six triangles incorporated on the outside of the hexagram; that it has six out points, and that six lines are used in constructing the symbol's two triangles. Thus, 6-6-6. Also, the symbol incorporates six triangles of three sides each. Six times three equals eighteen (6 X 3 = 18 and 6 + 6 + 6 = 18). An outstanding study of the six-pointed star was accomplished by Dr. O.J. Graham in the book, THE Six-Pointed Star. 1 Dr. Graham proves that this symbol was never used by King David of Israel and so the name Star of David is a misnomer. The symbol was chosen in 1947 for the flag of the fledgling nation of Israel at the insistence of the Rothschilds. Its usage stems from the medieval period when corrupt rabbis into cabalistic magic began to use the six-pointed star in their rituals. Dr. Graham does not mince words in declaring this emblem a tool of Satan, unworthy of use by the holy people of God. The Occult Triangle and the Masonic Lodge Returning back to the single triangle as a common symbol of occult usage, we note that the Freemasons were able, through the influence of Grand Master Benjamin Franklin, to have the triangle became the sun-lit capstone above the pyramid on the obverse (reverse) side of the Great Seal of the United States. The design of the 33rd degree jewel worn by the elite Mason is made up of interlocking triangles. The Real Grip of a Master Mason, which the Order claims can \"resurrect\" the candidate and cause him, in essence, to be \"born again\" (a counterfeit of the Christian experience) is formed with fingers separated to form a triangle. In the photos and illustrations in this section, you will find several real-life examples of this grip. In Coil's Masonic Encyclopedia we are told of the triangular chain, the legend taught by Freemasonry that Jewish Freemasons were carried as captives from Jerusalem to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar, being bound by triangular chains. The Babylonian King is said to have been gravely insulting the Jews by doing this because, to the Jews, the triangle, or delta symbol, was a symbol of their Deity. 2 King Solomon and the Triple Triangle In the 6° of Freemasonry, the Degree of Intimate Secretary, the concept of a triple triangle is introduced, said to be emblematic of the three Masons who were present at the opening of the first Lodge of Intimate Secretaries. It is further claimed that King Solomon was one of those three present. It is significant that in the first Book of Kings in the Holy Bible, King Solomon rebelled against God and His commandments and began to worship the god and goddess of the heathen in his temple. He also required of the High Priests of"},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"BLACK MAGIC, MASONIC WITCHCRAFT, AND TRIANGLE POWERS 363 Solomon's Temple that they annually render to him, as tribute, the sum of 666 talents of gold. Undoubtedly the number 666 is symbolically the triple triangle, because the holy number of the Goddess was 666. In Mackey's Masonic Ritualist, the author, Sovereign Grand Commander of the Scottish Rite, Albert Mackey, emphasized the key importance of the triangle in the rituals of Freemasonry. 5 The late Jim Keith, an exposer of conspiracies and cults, also discussed the importance of this symbol to Masonry. He writes, \"There is in fact a triad of three governing officers to be found in almost every degree.\" 4 In a number of books written by Masons, the downward pointing triangle is related to Set, the god of Egypt, and to Bacchus. Both of the deities are Satan in other guises. Jim Tresner, 33°, whose academic writings are often published in Masonic journals and publications, notes the use of triangles in the ritual for the fifteenth degree of the Scottish Rite, Knight of the East, of the Sword, or of the Eagle. Tresner says that the apron worn for this degree's ritual in the Lodge is of red velvet, and \"on the apron are three triangles, one inside the other, formed of chains with triangular links.\" These three triangles, he explains, \"represent the three great limitations on, or enemies of, the human intellect — tyranny, privilege, superstition.\" 5 In reality, Tresner is subtly alluding to the Masonic Order's long-standing doctrine of fierce opposition to existing political sovereigns not yet corrupted or conquered by Illuminism and its hatred of the true Christian Church, which the Masons teach is \"superstition\" and is a sectarian belief that cannot be tolerated. Tresner may object to my characterization, but the evidence of my allegations is insurmountable, as the rituals themselves prove. Rosicrucians, Theosophists, and The Triangle The Rosicrucian Order, too, relies on the triangle as a vehicle to impart and convey its teachings to rising candidates. For example, Arkon Daraul, in A History of Secret Societies, describes a ritualistic scene of initiation in a German branch of Rosicrucianism: The room of initiation was carpeted in green and on it were a number of objects... Three candelabra were placed to form a triangle, and nine glasses indicated the male and female properties... 6 Helena Blavatsky's worldwide cult Theosophy and its offspring, The Lucis Trust,"},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"364 CODEX MAGICA led for many years by prolific occult writer, Alice Bailey, likewise adopted the triangle as symbolic of their teachings. In 1937 the Lucis Trust founded a subsidiary group named Triangles which today encourages people across the globe to network by forming local three person triangle groups to come together often and meditate. In this way, said the parent organization in a letter, occult adepts can \"help to illumine world thought...through which the new incoming Aquarian energies can function, the new ideas spread, and the New World Order emerge.\" 7 According to Bailey, the coming New World Order of the New Age is best symbolized by a triangle within a circle, with a single dot, or point, within the triangle. This symbol is said to represent three Centres (in U.S.A., Centers), the point standing for the ruler of the spirit world, Sanat (an anagram for \"Satan\" apparently), the entity who at the appointed time will emerge to rule the Earth and humanity. The second Centre is Sanat's \"Hierarchy,\" the many unseen spirits (i.e. devils), and the third Centre is the human masses. 8 At the close of the Age, Bailey assures us, \"the three major Centres will be in complete unified and synchronized activity,\" controlling all manifestations of life. 9 Aleister Crowley, the late British satanist and Freemason, was also a devotee of the triangle as symbol. As a high-level officer of the occult group, Order of the Golden Dawn, Crowley used for one of his emblems the Eye of Horus in the Pyramid of Fire, radiated by the sun's rays. It was Horus, in the form of a spirit guide named Aiwass, that allegedly gave Crowley The Book of the Law, a book of prophecy Crowley claimed he received by automatic writing. 10 ABRACADABRA Not Just Childish Fun Witches and deep occult magicians join Bailey in use of the triangle. Take the word ABRACADABRA that is repeatedly used in kids TV cartoons and programs by supposedly mythical creatures like wizards and witches and fairies. Actually, this word is of ancient origins. In a poem on occult medicine written by a pagan doctor in ancient Rome about 250 AD, to ward off fevers and sickness, the physician recommended the word abracadabra be written down in an inverted triangle like this:"},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"BLACK MAGIC, MASONIC WITCHCRAFT, AND TRIANGLE POWERS 365 Next, the paper on which the word was written was to be tied round the patient's neck for nine days and then thrown backwards over the shoulder into a stream running eastwards. The fever then would shrink to nothing, the patient was told. The magical word ABRACADABRA comes from worship of the gnostic god, Abraxas. It literally means: The dead body, or corpse, of Abraxas. Witches often use the triangle as a protective symbol. They foolishly believe it can be used as a talisman, especially if the Tetragrammaton, the Hebrew letters for God, are inserted inside the triangle. The Masons do the same thing essentially in the Masters Jewel of the 4th degree. The triangle is inscribed on the ring given holders of the 14th degree also. The Geometrical God Is a Woman A closely kept secret of higher level Masons and other Illuminists is that, in addition to their worship of the Devil by other names, they also worship a female deity, the Great Goddess. This is made plain by John Yarker, a renowned British Freemason. Yarker's translation of the French manuscript, Lectures of a Chapter, Senate, and Council, informs us that the triangle's origins can be found in Egyptian religion, being the symbol of Isis, the Egyptian goddess: The triangle, which they called the geometrical God, was the emblem of Isis. 11 You'll recall that the symbol \"G\" is found at the center of the most common of Freemasonry's symbols, the Masonic square and compass, and that the Mason is told this letter G represents \"God\" and \"Geometry.\" This, then, is the \"geometrical god\" that, Yarker observes, \"was the emblem of Isis.\" Ever wonder why the Masons installed the statue of a woman in stone atop the U.S. Capitol building in Washington, D.C., and the statue of a woman called \"Liberty\" in New York City's harbor?

France's royal Merovingian Dynasty's bloodline is said to be the protector of the sect, which boasts that it is the actual bloodline of Jesus. The astonishing claim is that Jesus and Mary Magdalene were married and had children and from this bloodline shall someday arise a man who shall become the ruler of planet earth. The Holy Grail Tied in with this unscriptural — even blasphemous—legend are the tales of the Holy Grail and the Spear of Longinus. Some teach that as the blood of Jesus oozed from his body on the cross, it was collected in the Holy Grail cup. Esoterically that would make the Holy Grail, if it exists, magical and capable of great miracles. A variation of this story is that the Holy Grail was the drinking vessel of Jesus at the Last Supper, which again would translate into the cup being a magical talisman. The Spear of longinus The Spear of Longinus is yet another legend connected to the Priory of Sion. It holds that a Roman Centurion named Longinus was the one who thrust his spear into Jesus' side at the crucifixion. Some of Jesus' blood is alleged to have fallen on him and miracles ensued. Thus, again, a magical talisman was created — the Spear of Longinus. Throughout history wicked tyrants, including Napoleon and Hitler, have sought possession of the Spear, believing that it is the Spear of Destiny and that whoever possesses it shall have the power to rule the world. William Cooper, whose book, Behold a Pale Horse, and his revelations on his national radio program so angered the elite they put out a contract on his life,"},{"pageNumber":398,"pageContent":"406 CODEX MAGICA sometimes mentioned the Spear of Destiny. 2 Cooper was murdered by a combined federal-local police team that ambushed him as he peacefully stopped his pickup at a stop sign on his way home from a grocery store.

Again, I remind you that it makes not one iota of difference what you believe. If they (the Illuminati) believe, you will be affected. 3 The Spear As Pentagram and Lightning Bolt The Spear is a symbol of long-standing repute in the pagan and ancient Mystery Religions. In the Egyptian religion, it was called the Arrow of Re, or Ra, the Sun God, who was also called Horus, son of Osiris and his reincarnation, who had the all- seeing eye. Anton LaVey, in his book Satan Speaks, notes that the Sign of the Spear is actually the inverted pentagram. 4 In turn, the pentagram (the satanic five-pointed star), according to LaVey represents \"Excalibur, the Spear of Destiny, Wotan's spear point, the lightning bolt that created the protoplasm of life.\" 5 The Rosicrucians and the Sign of An Arrow Moreover, the Rosicrucian Order seems to be somehow connected with both the legend of the Spear and the Priory of Sion. D. C. Yermak, writing in The Axis of Death - Vatican, Masonry, Zionism, Enemies of God, explains that, \"The Rosicrucians, by making their secret sign with the first three fingers of the right hand united, make the Sign of an Arrow.\" 6 The Rosicrucian's Sign of an Arrow is dark and evil because it is used by the individual to remove himself from God's Blessing and leave himself purposely exposed to the arrows of the devil. (In this case, the form, or shape, relates the arrow to the spear). Dean Grace, authoritative researcher in symbology and Masonic secrets, believes that at least some modern-day disciples of this international black lodge, Priory of Sion, communicate their involvement to other hidden members by giving the Sign of the Spear Point. 7 In this sign, the point of the spear can either be sharply angular or it can be modified. Often, the fingers are positioned so that the horns and face of Baphomet are indistinctly seen, as in the inverted pentagram star. Grace's research also indicates the Priory of Sion is either linked or had something to do in the development of other, related occult groups such as the Order of Knights Templar. \"The spear point symbol,\" he says, \"is the building block of the four-spoked, eight-pointed Maltese Cross of the Order of the Knights of Malta.\" 8 How the Sign is Given A variation of the sharp, angular spear point sign is that displayed in this chapter of"},{"pageNumber":399,"pageContent":"THE MEROVINGIAN DYNASTY, THE PRIORY OF SION 407 Codex Magica in the photos of ABC News reporter Sam Donaldson and U.S.A.

As in all cases of secret hand signs, human variation and personality intervene, so that not all the signs are rendered expertly and in a crisp, uniform, standardized fashion. When placed in or near the female vulva area or the male genital area, the spear point becomes a phallic symbol. In all cases, the sign of the spear point is given so that the Y, the spear or arrow, is pointing downward, toward the nether regions where, presumably, Satan and his legions reside.

Ezekiel 8:6 Kabbalism is a system of Jewish mysticism and magic and is the foundational element in modern witchcraft. Virtually all of the great witches and sorcerers of this century were Kabbalists. — William J. Schnoebelen, in The Dark Side of Freemasonry In the decades of the 70s, 80s, and 90s, the hottest spiritual trend was the New Age movement. As we move forward through the first decade of the 21st century, the latest cure-all spiritual phenomenon seems to be the Jewish Cabala (or Kabbalah). The Cabala is not new, of course. It's been around for centuries. The Cabala is actually ancient magic. It is an exotic blend of devilish, sometimes fanciful, New Age mystical practices topped by a philosophical bent of Jewish supremacism. Orthodox Judaism, or phariseeism, is rife with cabalism, and Jewish rabbis are the Cabala's greatest promoters."},{"pageNumber":412,"pageContent":"420 CODEX MAGICA Celebrities and Cabala The recent explosion in mainstream interest in cabalism is boosted by the many big- name celebrities who have recently been hawking cabalism as the miraculous answer to all of man's problems. An undercover BBC reporter who infiltrated a London cabala group witnessed singer Madonna and Guy Ritchie chanting mystic spells to \"cleanse\" Chernobyl, the site in Ukraine of a nuclear plant disaster in 1986. 1 Other news accounts link entertainers Paris Hilton, Britney Spears, Roseanne Barr, Demi Moore, Shirley MacLaine, Ashton Kutcher, Sandra Bernhard, Barbra Streisand, Dianne Keaton, Gwyneth Paltrow, Goldie Hawn, Elizabeth Taylor, Michael Jackson, Mick Jagger, Uri Gellar, Diane Ladd, Laura Dern and a legion of other \"stars\" with practice of cabala. 2 Look closely when you see any of these people on TV or pictured in magazines and you'll often see the characteristic red string wristband they wear. Lately, former President Bill Clinton's been spotted wearing it—he's a cabalist—and so has Florida's politician Katherine Harris, who became a famous household icon as Florida's Republican Secretary of State during the bizarre 2000 election snafu. Republican big- wig and former House Speaker, Newt Gingrich is reported to be a cabala advocate, and some say conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh and his rabbi are also into the cabala. Among the most notorious of cabalists are the TV comedy stars of the once #1- rated \"The Jerry Seinfeld Show.\" The producer of the Seinfeld show was Larry David, a Jew, all four of the cast were Jews, and cabalistic hand signs, occult language, and magic rituals were covertly planted in many episodes.

Michael Richards, who portrayed the klutzy \"Kramer\" in Seinfeld, also seems to relish giving cabalistic and Masonic hand signs and gestures. Richards was pictured on the front cover of the Scottish Rite Journal, and inside the publication, he told of how pleased he is to be a Freemason. 3 Star Trek's Leonard Nimoy (\"Mr. Spock\") is constantly sighted in cabalistic poses. His famous Vulcan hand sign on the TV series was actually the Hebrew letter, Shin. 4 Its display is part and parcel of Jewish religion. So every time viewers observed Mr. Spock (Nimoy) giving the sign, they were unknowingly being made a participant in a cabalistic occult ritual. Sodom, Egypt, and 21st Century Judaism In one of the most controversial of all the many video documentaries I have produced, Cauldron of Abbadon, I stated, \"From Jerusalem and Israel flow a torrent of satanic evil and mischief endangering the whole world. \" 5 Zionist Jews and their cohorts in the Christian Zionist community were angered over what I said, but they had no response to the mountain of facts presented in the video proving my point. It is undeniable that God Himself, in Revelation 11:8, declares that in the last days just prior to Christ's return, one of the most wicked places on earth will be Jerusalem and Israel. In Revelation God calls Jerusalem \"Sodom and Egypt.\" The question is, why? Why is Jerusalem and the nation of Israel spiritually \"Sodom and Egypt?\" I believe it is because of the Jewish religion, a religion diametrically opposed to the Old Testament faith of Moses, Isaac, Jacob, and the prophets. From the days of the Jews' captivity in Babylon, to today, the religion of the Jews has increasingly grown more dark and more wicked. Jesus openly castigated the Jewish religionists; He called them \"blind guides,\" \"fools, hypocrites.\" He said, \"ye devour widows' houses, and for a pretense make long prayer...ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves\" (Matthew 23:14-15). Children of hell, that's what Jesus called the Jewish religious teachers. That was almost 2,000 years ago. Well, guess what? The Jewish religionists are even worse now, in the 21st century. They've had almost 2,000 years more to practice and perfect their evil religion. Today, those who practice satanic cabalism and believe in the Talmud are the children of hell a hundred times over. In Codex Magica we do not have the space to fully report on the almost unbelievably wicked Talmudic and Cabalistic religion of the Jews. But it is important to understand that the horrific nature of the Jews' religion lie in its man-made traditions. In reality, these traditions are satanic in origin. I refer especially to the Jewish Talmud, the legalistic law traditions of the rabbis, and to the Jewish Cabala (also Kabbalah or Quaballah), which are the mystical teachings and traditions of the rabbis and sages."},{"pageNumber":414,"pageContent":"422 CODEX MAGICA If the Jews had stuck to the teachings of the Old Testament, Satan would not have had such terrible inroads. Indeed, if Moses and the prophets had been heeded, or if their writings were honored today, the Jews would believe in Jesus Christ as Messiah and be saved by faith in His promises. Instead, the Jews departed from the prophets, and over the centuries the rabbis steadily developed a body of man-made literature (the Talmud and the Cabala) that is supremely wicked and corrupt. Their traditions, moreover, are antithetical to the Faith and teachings of Moses and the prophets. (I do not refer, of course, to the Faith of Jews who are Christian believers.) Worse, it can be remarkably demonstrated that the philosophy and doctrines of the Jewish Cabala are the very fount and wellspring of virtually every wicked, occult sect, satanic secret society, and witchcraft cult that has arisen in the past one thousand years! The Cabala brings together in one neat package the core of all the Mystery teachings of the ancients. Indeed, the Holy Bible gives evidence that the Jewish elders had brought the Mysteries into the Temple and had conducted secret ceremonies in hidden chambers as far back as the days of the prophet Ezekiel (see Ezekiel 8). God called these teachings and rituals \"abominations.\" Regrettably, the abominations are multiplied in the 21st century Jewish religion in which the Cabala plays a central role. The Masonic Lodge and The Cabala Freemasonry has long praised the Cabala, and its top officials have admitted that the Lodge's rituals and teachings are but the offspring of the Jewish tradition. Albert Pike, former Sovereign Grand Commander of the Scottish Rite wrote: \"One is filled with admiration, on penetrating into the Sanctuary of the Cabala.\" 6 Just how much Masonry owes to the Cabala is illustrated by study of the Knights of Kadosh degree (30°). Ed Decker, director of Free the Masons Ministries, reports that the trappings of this degree ritual are \"overtly sinister\" and incorporate a \"High level of Kabbalistic symbolism.\" When one is surrounded by black curtains, skulls, and a coffin with a shrouded knight speaking forth from within, it doesn't take a spiritual giant to discern that this is not a godly organization! 7 Confirming Decker's findings, medical doctor James L. Holly, a Christian who has done great works in exposing Freemasonry, in his outstanding volume, Th e Southern Baptist Convention and Freemasonry, shows how the 30° Masonic initiate is led unawares into a direct spiritual relationship with Satan. In the ritual, Satan is personified as a mysterious cabalistic mystic. 8 Interestingly, Richardson's Monitor of Freemasonry says that, \"the Knights of Kadosh Degree is intimately connected with the ancient Order of Knights Templar, as it commemorates their old ceremonies of initiation.\" 9 Allegedly, the members of the Order of Knights Templar worshipped Baphomet, the hideous male/female Luciferian goat god and conducted blasphemous ceremonies, which included urinating on a cross and homosexual sodomy."},{"pageNumber":415,"pageContent":"MAGICAL SIGNS OF THE JEWISH CAB A LA 423 Freemasonry is Jewish In 1855, the renowned Rabbi Isaac Wise wrote: \"Freemasonry is a Jewish establishment, whose history, grades, official appointments, passwords, and explanations are Jewish from beginning to end.\" 10 The Jewish Tribune newspaper, in 1927, in an editorial, stated: \"Freemasonry is based on Judaism.

Here a rabbi is seen carrying a chicken off to be sacrificed in a voodoo/ Santeria-type ritual during the Jewish festival of Yom Kippur. (Israel, A Photobiography, by Micha Bar-Am, New York: Simon & Schuster, 1998) Twisted Satanic Rituals and lies The rabbinical doctrines and teachings of Cabalism are based on a curious blending and mosaic of astrology, numerology, graphology, color magic, symbology, alchemy, pagan religion, and pure Luciferianism. There are hand signs and body gestures, talismanic jewelry and clothing, hidden codes, and on and on. The end result is a confusing jumble of \"man is God\" theology (but only Jewish man— Gentiles are inferior) and magical formulae, words of power, incantations and spells. Heads of chickens are cropped off and blood sprinkled around; \"magic cords\" of specific color are worn on the wrist as miracle-working bracelets; magic water is used to heal; magic symbols are objects of trance-like mediation; and mantra- like chants are repeated over and over. The 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet are touted as religious idols of great magical powers. Even their shapes are studied and accorded supernatural powers. Angels, Archangels, grimoires, devas, and elementals are worshipped and feared. There are \"gods\" and more \"gods\" but only a mysterious, hazy supreme deity behind everything. This supreme deity is a pantheistic god who fills up the whole universe. In fact, he is the macrocosm, the Universe. Of course, as in all Illuminist magic, there's the double-minded theology of \"As Above, So Below,\" the insidious lie that black is white and vice versa; that good and evil are one, that the shadow and the substance are unitary. Sex magic holds an important place in Cabalism, and sex ritual is a popular vocation of students of Cabala. Margie Martin, in her informed, unpublished manuscript for her upcoming book, The Molten Image, explains that the Tarot cards of witches and occultists are of Jewish origin and correspond with the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet. Finally, Cabalism is pure Illuminism because it teaches the secret doctrine that, ultimately, the higher level adept learns: That the Holy Serpent is the true God; that all the evil that a person does, through alchemy, is magically transformed into righteousness; and that, yes, Lucifer is Lord. Satan is the true and only god. That is the essential doctrine of Cabalism."},{"pageNumber":419,"pageContent":"MAGICAL SIGNS OF THE JEWISH CABALA 427 The Star of David and The Jewish Utopia The symbol of the Jewish six-pointed star, known as the Seal of Solomon and as the Magen David, is the preeminent symbol of Cabalism, but other symbols, signs, and marks also hold the interest of cabalists, including the pentagram or pentacle, the triangle, the circle, the sun, the obelisk, the yoni, and the diamond. It is believed by cabalistic rabbis that there are hidden codes and messages in the numbering of scriptural letters. It is also believed that by working the Cabala, the earth may someday be renovated, rebuilt, perfected. This, say the rabbis, will result in a perfect Jewish Kingdom, or Utopia on earth, ruled by a Cabalist Master, a Jewish leader, naturally. This belief system of the coming of a Jewish Utopia fits in well with the teachings of the Illuminati.

Directed by Paul Wegener, Der Golem depicted the monster variously wearing either the five-pointed star with one point up (white magic) or two points up (satanic). Also the six pointed Star of David played a part in the film's plot as a Jewish Rabbi, Rabbi Low, using the secret word \"AemAct\" brought life and breath into the artificial man.

Englishman John Yarker, a well-known nine- teenth century Masonic magician and occultist, in his Notes on the Scientific and Religious Mysteries of Antiquity, makes mention of the fact that the High Priests of the ancient Jews also worshipped the sun god. He writes: The Mysteries we know were practiced in a secret subterranean chamber under the Temple of Solomon, at Jerusalem, where four and twenty elders adored the sun, with their Sun worship in Peru exemplifies the faces toward the east.' universal worship of the sun god, or solar diety.  What Yarker says is true, but as the Scriptures give evidence, this unholy worship by the Jewish leaders in secret was an abomination to God. Ezekiel 8 makes this crystal clear. It is understandable why God would so detest worship of the sun god by the Mystery Religions and by the apostate Jewish elders. In reality, in worshipping the sun, the ancients were worshipping Satan. G.H. Pember, in a scholarly work on the Mysteries, Earth's Earliest Ages, affirms this fact when he states, \"There is little doubt that the culmination of the Mysteries was the worship of Satan himself.\" 2 Now today, the Masons, as did the apostate Jewish elders and priests in the days of Ezekiel, continue to worship Satan the sun god, also called Lucifer or Baal, by other names. The name of their great god, Jahbuhlun, which is revealed to Masons in the higher degrees, is a synonym for the solar deity; two of the three syllables in the name, buh and lun, mean \"Baal\" and \"On,\" both of which represent sun and fire gods. That is why, in the authoritative guide Gods of the Lodge, Reginald Haupt reports that in the Lodge: All the movements by the Consecrating Officers of the Masonic Lodge or Chapter follow the course of the Sun. The Master and the Wardens enter and leave their chairs as the Sun returns to the East and goes forth therefrom. Most processional occasions are governed by these principles of what is known as \"circumambulation.\" This ritual came from the ancient pagan rites of the Egyptians and from the worship of their Sun God and of the sun itself. 3 The first 15 divisions of the Egyptian Royal Cubit. Each division of the cubit was dedicated to a divinity, and the first division, on the right, shows the hieroglyph of the sun god Ra, symbol of divine unity.

Politicians are sometimes framed with a sun-like halo, called a \"nimbus,\" over their heads. This gives them the subtle majestic appearance of being some type of god-man. In honoring and worshipping the sun in their rituals, Freemasonry and Illuminism defy God. The Bible's Job displayed great wisdom by uttering these words concerning God's thoughts concerning worship of the sun and the heavens: If I beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking in brightness; and my heart hath been secretly enticed... this also was an iniquity to be punished by the judge; for I should have denied the God who is above. (Job 31:26-28) The Swastika Represents the Sun The Nazi swastika is a representation of the sun. But the Nazis simply borrowed this symbol from the ancient religions, including the Hindus of India, the Shintoists of Japan, and a number of Native American Indian tribes. Even today, in temples and shrines throughout Asia, you will find the swastika painted on walls, on totem poles, and over altars. Until Hitler and the Nazis gave the sign a bad reputation, the Masons also universally used the sun sign. And today the symbol of the circle, particularly that of the point within the circle, is a prominent feature of Masonic theology. The Point Within the Circle According to Mackey's Masonic Encyclopedia the hidden, true meaning of this symbol, the point inside the circle, is far different than what the everyday Masonic brother is told. In reality, its meaning is yet another proof that Masonry is a sex cult. Mackey says the esoteric explanation is that the point within the circle is the male phallus, or penis, and the circle is the female yoni, or vagina. Here, says Mackey, is a \"symbol of fecundity, expressed by the male generative principle.\" 4 But, Mackey emphasizes, the sun is still not forgotten in Masonry, for while the"},{"pageNumber":453,"pageContent":"462 CODEX MAGICA importance to the Illuminati Masons and yet is so little recognized as significant by the dumbed-down masses, many Illuminists enjoy a bit of mockery of the masses by blatantly displaying this symbol. Some believe the Target department store chain logo—the red circle and point—is one example. Pat Robertson's Hidden Message Pat Robertson, Religious Right leader of TVs The 700 Club and founder of the Christian Coalition, gives us another graphic example. Some years ago, Robertson had two books ghostwritten for him, one called The New World Order and another titled The New Millennium. As happens often in elitist circles, the opinions and material for both books seemed to be decidedly anti-elitist; they even exposed the global conspiracy and the Illuminati. So, was Pat Robertson really joining the fight against the evil Illuminati? Not on your life! The books were for the \"stupids,\" the masses. While reading The New Millennium the reader ignorant of the uses of symbolism probably ignored the fact that at the top of every page, a point within a circle could be found. This was Robertson's \"hidden code\" to his elite pals that he was still on their side and was just taking the ignorant masses for a ride. The Sign of the Mafia, the Illuminati and of Druids According to Dr. Cathy Burns, in Hidden Secrets of the Eastern Star, the point within the circle is, \"The sign of the infamous Mafia or Cosa Nostra,\" rather than the \"black hand\" as many believe. 6 But the real shocker is the importance given this sign by Adam Weishaupt and the Order of the Illuminati. Burns explains that because Illuminism was so determined to keep the true nature of the Order under wraps, its founder, Weishaupt, ordered that the actual words \"Illuminati\" and \"Illuminism\" never be used in correspondence. Instead they were to be replaced by the astrological symbol for the sun; that is, the circle with a dot in the middle. 7 Burns also gives evidence that the point within An Arch-Druid from pagan Great Britain in his ceremonial robes.

Flower Power and Magic Circles The daisy flower, the marigold, and the sunflower also are indicative of the sun as deity and so, traditionally, adherents of the Mystery Religions, as well as Hindus, Zoroastrians, and others, utilize these symbols. Adam Weishaupt, founder in 1776 of the Order of the Illuminari, encouraged \"Flower Power\" as a symbol, and it was taken up by New Age hippies in the '60s. The symbol of the circle is, for the Illuminari, sort of a pared down, basic sun sign. That is why the circle is used so frequently and in a score of configurations within Masonic and other secret society networks. It is also a staple of witchcraft and Satan worship.

This is precisely what God does not want in His Church, and yet all these Masons are flaunting both their idols and their (church) membership. 3 Schnoebelen also mentions a little pin many Masons wear on the lapel of their jacket or coat shaped like a hockey stick with two balls attached. It is named \"Tubal Cain.\" In reality, it represents a man's phallus and testicles; yet, the pin is worn publicly and proudly by many perverted Masons. A Bond Between Chieftains and Warriors Barbara Walker, editor of The Woman's Dictionary of Symbols and Sacred Objects, discusses the significance of the ring in her book. She says that, \"Rings were traditional symbols of the bond between chieftains and their warriors in Anglo-Saxon England.\" Moreover... Among the Celts, a ring given by a woman to a man represented her sexual availability; putting the finger through the ring was a sign of sexual intercourse. 4 The ring, then is a symbol of authority, of bonding, and is a sign of the covenant made between the inferior and superior members of the Illuminati group. In ancient religions and cultures, rings were also magical in nature. According to cabalistic rabbis, King Solomon used a magic ring with a hexagram symbol on it to enslave the demon Asmodeus into helping him build his famous Temple. Some members of the Illuminati in France in the late 18th century, about 1780, founded a new secret order, the Academy of Sublime Masters of the Luminous Ring. The tenets of the group were Pythagorean, and the fields of geometry and science were emphasized. 5 In today's Illuminati, the philosophy underlying the use of rings, neckties, etc. \"Tubal Cain,\" the phallus pin worn by many Masons.

The Mystic Tie of the Masons The Masonic fraternity teaches the illusory goal that all who are inititated into its ranks are bonded by the \"Mystic Tie\" of fellowship. Of course, this is allegory, and yet the necktie does seem to have a special place in Masonic lore and symbology. It is believed that both the bowtie and the traditional necktie are of Masonic symbolic design. The necktie has two triangles descending, a larger and a smaller. It is tied into a \"knot\" at the neck, signifying solidarity and unity. The neck itself, as a part of the human anatomy, represents the virtue of sacrifice. In terms of the secret order or secret society, it symbolizes sacrifice of the individual to the common good of the organization. The necktie is also seen as a bridge to two other triangles — those of the shirt collar. All of the triangles, on the tie and on the shirt collar, have their point, or spear, downward, toward the realm that is the controlling force of Masonry. Congressman Lloyd Poggett (D-TX), at center, is sworn in as a voter registrar for the State of Texas. The elite of the Democrat Party in Doggett's Austin, Texas district are heavily Freemason.

In his photo, Newt Gingrich appears tired and dismayed. He is sweaty. No make-up is used, and he has a day old growth of stubble on his face and neck. There is also a red coloration or flush on Newt s face. His head is strategically placed behind the Time logo, communicating the subtle message that his time in the political limelight is about up. In fact, Gingrich did abruptly resign and leave his high level post shortly after this issue; some believe his departure was caused by his unseemly romantic liaison with a female staffer, an affair which prompted the Congressman to divorce his wife. However, the most significant images you'll find on this cover are hidden on Newt Gingrich's necktie! Look closely at the inset and what do you see? A dinosaur. The cave age monster is facing downward toward a flower. The Illuminati's founder Adam Weishaupt, in the late 18th century, introduced the concepts of \"flower power\" and nature worship (shades of the hippy era of the 60s!). So that might explain the flower. But what about the dinosaur? It seems that Newt (get the name, Newt ? - isn't a Newt a form of lizard?) is a dinosaur fan. Gingrich once borrowed a Tyrannosaurus Rex dinosaur bones exhibit from Washington, D.C.'s Smithsonian Museum and kept it on display for a long time in his House Speaker's office. Newsmagazines often commented that Newt Gingrich was wry proud of the T-Rex display and constantly asked friends and associates, \"Would you like to see my T4tx!\" Now, Webster's dictionary informs us that the root word for \"tyrannosaurus\" is rvranr, or tyranny, defined as \"A government in which absolute power is vested in a single ruler\"—a ruler unfettered by a constitution! What's more, the short version of the dinosaur's name, T-Rex, would have a very special meaning for occult illuminati. \"T\" stands for Tammuz, the Christ figure to come, whose symbol is the T, or Tau cross. The word \"Rex,\" meanwhile, stands for Man as King. In Weishaupt's Illuminati system, the highest degree initiate earned the \"Rex\" degree. Thus, the symbols on Newt Gingrich's necktie, displayed for all the world to see, but for only Newt and his Illuminati henchmen to understand, trumpet this message, that: Our llluminati goal is a tyranny, ruled by a single ruler—the fearful antichrist, beast of prophecy! The caption reads: \"Speaker Newt Gingrich shows off tyrannosaurus rex Osborn in his Capitol office.

It's done with the fingers and thumb of right or left hands (usually the right). Simply touch the index finger to the thumb, creating a circle. The other three fingers then spiral off and there you have it—the well-known symbol for OK. Universally, this sign means alright, acceptable, good, right-on, you bet!, A-OK, satisfactory... But to occultists, the OK sign takes on darker significance. First, we have the circle, indicating the sun deity and the Mason's never-ending quest for more light. To Freemasonry, the circle also represents the female genitalia, or yoni. In the Hindu religion, the OK sign is a revered mudra (sacred gesture) meaning \"infinity\" or perfection. It is associated with the female genitalia — thumb and forefinger pressed together at the tips with the other three fingers extended. In the practice of tantric yoga (sex rituals), the OK sign is a token of ecstasy, spiritual and physical. In ancient Sumeria and Persia, charms and amulets have been discovered of fingers and hands in the modern OK position, joined along with horns implying fertility. The three fingers extended outward are symbolic of ecstatic union with the Goddess, the third member of the pagan trinity. In Satanism, when making this sign the three fingers not used to make the circle are considered symbolic of the unholy trinity — horned god, goddess, and offspring (antichrist). Some go so far as to adopt the view that the bent three fingers are shaped as three number six's, or 666.

Oh what a web of evil wicked men can weave around something seemingly so ordinary and mundane. In the Illuminist philosophy, the OK sign becomes a sign indicating approval of the Divine King, their coming Lord of Light, whom we as Christians know as Antichrist. To them it means, \"He approves our undertaking.\" This meaning is roughly equivalent to the words in Latin atop the all-seeing eye of Osiris on our U.S. one dollar bill— Annuit Coeptus. A Gesture to Avoid? As we've noted, the gesture made by touching the tips of the thumb and index finger to form a circle, with the remaining three fingers of the hand fanned out and pointing out may signify \"A-Okay\" in the U.S.A., but in other cultures the same gesture will certainly not meet with approval. In Brazil, Germany, and Russia, the signal is a supreme insult and vulgar, indicating a very private body orifice. In France, the sign portrays the person it is aimed at as being a flunky or a \"zero\" — basically a worthless person. When it's placed over the nose it means he or she is drunk. In Japan, the same sign is used in commercial transactions to indicate you want the cashier to give you your change in coins rather than in currency. In Spain, in Eastern Europe, and in some parts of Latin America, the OK hand gesture is considered very rude. When then Vice President Nixon visited Brazil in the 50s, a crowd of onlookers became a rampaging mob after Nixon flashed them what he thought was the A-Okay sign. To them, Nixon was making an obscene gesture. Nixon's \"goodwill\" trip suddenly became a \"badwill\" trip. And there's more confusion abroad: In Arab countries, making this sign while shaking the hand symbolizes the giving of the \"evil eye,\" perceived by Arabs as an event of great dread. It may be interpreted that you are putting a curse on the individual.

It was standard for the cigar-smoking, paunchy politician; he flashed the \"V\" sign every chance he got, and news photographers captured hundreds of photographs of Churchill giving the sign. It was generally thought that in doing so, the pugnacious Churchill was signaling confidence in eventual victory over the Nazi foe across the channel. So, the sign of two fingers pointed upward in a \"V'shape became universally accepted as a sign for victory. Sign of the Horned God, Pan But what the majority of people believe to be conventional wisdom is often wrong. Such is the case here, too, for this sign, in reality, is of ancient origins. It is, in fact, a sign of Satan, of malediction, of the horned god, Pan, and worse. Paranoia magazine, an interesting publication which bills itself as \"the conspiracy reader\" had a picture some years back of Churchill displaying the \"V.\" An astute reader knowledgeable of dark things wrote a letter to the editor in the next issue commenting on Churchill and his sign. Nigel A. Cornwall of Britain wrote, \"The sign I believe has its origins as a symbol for a pagan horned god.\" 1 Cornwall also suggested that when the sign is given with the palm inside, it is"},{"pageNumber":508,"pageContent":"518 CODEX MAGICA recognized as a horribly vulgar and offensive gesture—signifying penetration of both body orifices. Done in the typical fashion, this sign literally means intercourse by the devil—to be violated sexually by the horned god. The thumb holding down the fingers creates the \"vulva,\" while the two largest fingers pointed up are the horns of the god (Satan). THE Law of Opposites In her highly regarded encyclopedia of symbols entitled Masonic and Occult Symbols Illustrated, Dr. Cathy Burns explores the meaning of the \"V\" sign. She explains that the two fingers upward relate to the Masonic and Gnostic Law of Opposites, exactly as the case for the Masonic Lodge's black and white checkerboard floors. This is the doctrine of bringing order out of chaos, of reconciling the two opposites, evil and good, with Satan reigning over both heaven and hell. 2 The \"V\" sign is also a sign of the Horned God of witchcraft, often called Pan; or Baphomet, the androgynous (male and female) goat god (again illustrating the Law of Opposites). The Face in the Shadow The Complete Book of Witchcraft 3 explains further the occult meaning. When the sign is given to produce a shadow behind, a diabolical image appears that seems to be the face of the devil. Witches and Magicians—and some Catholic Popes —used this image to effect emotional responses: There was a deeply seated belief in the fascination or enchantment of shadows; so that the witch, or magician, could use them to either produce sickness and death or to inspire love...The shadow of the (Satanic) priest's fingers raised in blessing was considered to have evil significance... A remarkable thing occurred with the hand so lifted, is that its shadow resembles the head and horns of the Goat of Baphomet...the symbol of black magic. The use of the 'shadow of blessing' was regarded as the legitimate prerogative of the Pope, and was most terribly exercised during the Dark Ages and at the time of the Inquisition. 4 Interestingly, other authoritative sources say that the \"V\" sign (the sign of the horny goat, or horned god) is practiced even today in satanic covens as a symbol of Satanic benediction. In times past, it was just the opposite, being a sign of evil, of malediction, but today the twisted minds of satanic worshippers view evil as something good and desirable. What is malediction to the holy and righteous, to the Satanist is a wonderful thing! A Symbol of Wrath and Destruction The \"V\" sign as displayed by the hand is also used by Illuminists in the form of the"},{"pageNumber":509,"pageContent":"VICTORY FOR THE DEVIL 519 letter V with two straight lines angled to meet at a point facing downward. It becomes a V device, or chevron, and has been adopted for the uniforms of military troops of some countries. Resembling a downward pointing triangle with the top line open or omitted symbolizes fiery destruction and wrath on the object at which it is pointed. About 12 years ago, a few Satan worshippers arrived secretly in the darkness at my ministry building and evidently carried out a ritual. For many months we had received anonymous telephone threats, so were not surprised. On the concrete porch near our front door, the vandals had scratched a \"V\" pointing to the entrance, and there were signs of candle use and the burning of objects. Here we see the fantastic beliefs by occultists that their rituals create reality. However, in vainly attempting to harm a true Christian ministry, I am persuaded that the \"magic\" backfired. When God is your protector, those who cast Satan's spells end up in deep, deep, trouble. Triple 6 or 666 As we have previously seen, the Jewish cabala is at the root of most wicked systems of magic. The cabala (or Kabbalah) is the fount of doctrine for Freemasonry and for many other secret societies. We can expect, therefore, that the \"V\" sign is also emphasized by the rabbinical priests of cabalism. And in fact, we find that the rabbis teach that the meaning of the Hebrew letter for V (Vau) is \"Nail,\" and nail is a secret title for Satan. (Its corrupt meaning comes from the nails driven into the hands of Jesus crucified.) Vau, or V, is the sixth letter in the Hebrew alphabet, and, of course, the Book of Revelation reveals that the name of the beast, or Antichrist, is coded with the number of triple 6, or 666. Churchill A Druid Priest Where did Winston Churchill learn of the satanic powers of the \"V\" sign? Few people are aware that Churchill was a Freemason. Stephen Knight wrote an explosive expose, The Brotherhood, that rocked the British Isles when it was published some 15 years ago. 5 In it, he unmasked many British nobles, police, judges, and politicians who were Masons. Among them: Winston Churchill, who, Knight documented, was initiated in 1903 at Lodge No. 3000 of the United Lodge of Great Britain. However, even fewer people are aware that Churchill was not only a Mason but a witch druid! Dr. Stanley Monteith, occult and secret society researcher and host of Radio Liberty out of California, states: \"Churchill was an adept of the occult, having been inducted into the Druids in 1908, and having pledged the occult oaths required of those who have entered into the world of Freemasonry.\" 6 Monteith's sobering statements are backed up by Miranda J. Green's The World of the Druids and by John Daniel's Scarlet and the Beast, two excellent resource books. 7 Rites of the Druid Witchcraft Sea The rites and ceremonies of the Druid witchcraft sect—which has chapters both in Great Britain and in the United States —are remarkably similar to those of Freemasonry. They hearken back to the Ancient Mystery Religions."},{"pageNumber":510,"pageContent":"520 CODEX MAGICA The Burning Man in the Wicker Cage Some scholars are convinced that human sacrifice was practiced by the Druids. Julius Caesar, Roman General who conquered Britain for Imperial Rome, wrote of how brutal and furiously savage were the people under the influence of the Druid priesthood. He also described the horror of the rite in which the Druid priests and people would periodically choose a victim to be confined inside a huge wicker effigy. The wicker was set ablaze and the human victim consumed by the flames as the people celebrated and paraded in a circle carrying candles. Even today, at the ruins of Stonehenge in England, modern-day Druids meet on festival occasions, wearing the appropriate white garb and carrying out rites and worship of the ancient gods. Meanwhile, in Nevada each year, hundreds of thousands attend the incredible \"Burning Man\" festival at which the sacrificial ritual of the burning wicker man is recreated. 8 Archbishop of England Also A Druid Amazingly, the British press recently carried news reports, including pictures, of the Druid initiation of a man, Rowan Williams, who just happens to be Archbishop of Canterbury, head of the Church of England. Williams told reporters that he saw no incompatibility in his duties as a pagan Druid priest and those he has assumed as Archbishop of the —presumably Christian —Anglican Church of England. This is yet more evidence of how apostate and corrupt the global \"Christian\" establishment is today. While it is true that the true Christian Church, though tiny in numbers, lives on and is undefeated, the majority of modern-day pastors, ministers, and churchmen have departed from the Faith and have no concept at all of genuine Christian doctrine. The spectacle of the top, so-called \"Christian\" clergyman of the entire British Commonwealth, Archbishop Williams, being initiated as a wizard in the Druid witchcraft sect and publicly boasting of it is proof positive that the Devil and his Illuminati have become the unacknowledged \"Masters\" who run the Christian establishment behind-the-scenes.

It stands for \"Thor,\" the ancient Nordic god, and it stands for Baal, or Bel, the demonic god so often mentioned in derisive terms in the Old Testament."},{"pageNumber":529,"pageContent":"EVERY MAN AND WOMAN IS A STAR 539 This same star god was worshipped in Egypt, and the children of Israel, while wandering in the desert, fell under his hypnotic powers. They called him Moloch, Chiun, and Remphan. The prophet Amos castigated the Jewish idolaters for this unholy sacrilege: But ye have borne the tabernacle of your Moloch and Chiun your images, the star of your god, which ye made to yourselves. (Amos 5:20) A Magical Charm and Talisman To Illuminists everywhere, the pantacle star, or pentagram, is considered a powerful charm, a talisman, and an emblem of favor with the Deity of the Underworld. Oh, how the Communists, founded by Karl Marx, a high priest of Satan, cherished their red stars! In degree rituals of Freemasonry, an appropriate \"Jewel\" is awarded the rising initiate. It is believed that this Jewel holds magical powers. It can be used to invoke, or invite, spirits and to work spells. Albert Pike thus advised: Another Jewel is necessary for you, and in certain undertakings cannot be dispensed with. It is what is termed the Kabalistic pantacle (pentagram)...This carries with it the power of commanding the spirits of the elements. It is necessary for you to know how to use it. 6 In other words, Pike is recommending the star be the vehicle to invoke demon powers and cause them to do magical work. Now, before you dismiss Pike's suggestion and imagine he was just some silly, insane occult nut, let me remind you that so respected is this man by the Illuminati of today, that a statue of Albert Pike stands in front of the Department of Justice building, the offices of the U.S. Attorney-General, in Washington, D.C. Displayed on public land, that statue is carefully tended to by the National Park Service. Moreover, the body of the much-revered former Sovereign Grand Commander Albert Pike, who died in 1891, is entombed in the Scottish Rite's House of the Temple, exactly 13 blocks from the White House. Technically, there are several different types of occultic stars, each having its own set of doctrinal characteristics. The enneagram, for example, a nine-pointed star, is popular as a spiritual talisman in the Bahai faith and Theosophy and in other New Age occult sects. The pentagram, from the Greek \"pente,\" meaning five, and \"gramma,\" a letter (thus the \"letter five\") is a five-pointed star. A pentalpha is more blatantly satanic. It is the form of a triple triangle. The pentagram star can also be called the pentacle, pentalpha, the Star of Isis, the Star of Venus and by other names. Its usage can be traced back to Babylon and it has often been employed in magical rites and activities. It is sometimes said that the inverted pentagram, when it has two points ascendant, connotes evil and two points descendant, or down, indicates good, but this is not so. Either direction can be evil."},{"pageNumber":530,"pageContent":"540 CODEX MAGICA Israel's Six-Pointed Star The six-pointed star, known as the Seal of Solomon, as the Magen David of the Jews, or as the hexagram, is considered by witches and occultists of all stripes as a powerful tool of witchcraft and magic. With this image, one can cast spells, curse victims, and otherwise wreak havoc. Or so it is said. The six-pointed star was especially beloved by the cabalistic rabbis of the medieval era. The Rothschild Dynasty later adopted this star as a magical device and was instrumental in persuading (money talks!) the fledgling Zionist entity, Israel, to adopt the six-pointed star as the national emblem. It is the symbol of the Israel national flag, even though a more appropriate device undoubtedly would be the Torah, the Menorah, or some other historic or religious symbol. 7 Geometrically and numerically (points, lines, triangles) the six-pointed star translates into the number 666. Thus, it is very possible that the six-pointed star could become the Mark of the Beast, the Antichrist, as prophesied in Revelation 13. The Illuminists, cabalists, and Masons cunningly have also chosen the six-pointed star as symbol because of its hidden sexual meanings. It is made up of two triangles, integrated together, one superimposed on the other. The triangle pointing downward (Delta) represents the female vagina; the triangle pointed upward the male phallus. Joined, or yoked, the two triangles represent the generative sex act. 8 Illuminati Stars Around the World The Illuminati have cleverly designed architecture and art over the face of the whole earth to integrate their star talismans into global culture. For example, Texas is called the \"Lone Star State,\" a choice of the Masons—Sam Houston, James Bowie, David Crockett, Stephen F. Austin, and others—who wrested political control of the state in an internecine struggle with Mexican Masonry (Mexican President, General Santa Anna, was also a Mason). Today, the five-pointed Texas star, actually an Illuminati icon, is displayed across the state. The stars on the U.S. flag are of Masonic origination. The music later used for our national anthem, the Star-Spangled Banner, was composed by a Mason, John Stafford Smith, a member of Royal Somerset House and Inverness Lodge No. 4, London. Another Mason, Francis Scott Key, set the words to the music, and it became recognized as America's national anthem. 9 Stars have, since World War II, been prominently painted on U.S.A. military equipment—on tanks, jeeps, aircraft—and as badges and emblems on the uniforms of American servicemen. The Communists in Russia, China, and elsewhere—Illuminists all—adopted the Red Star as a dominant icon of totalitarian dictatorship and emblazoned it on everything, from their flags and monuments to works of art and items of clothing. None of this is by accident. Always remember, the whole planet is a ritual stage for these mad-men. They have planted evil seeds everywhere one turns. In the scriptures, Paul and John warn that until Jesus our Lord finally puts a stop to this insanity, Satan is god of this world (2 Corinthians 4:4).

Hitler and Himmler must have been green with envy."},{"pageNumber":553,"pageContent":"564 CODEX MAGICA What is most surprising—at least to the uninformed general public —is that few today are even aware of the Soviet Holocaust. Because of the Jewish ownership of the Western media, all the emphasis is put on the crimes of the Nazis. The horrors of the Red Terror are neglected. Maybe more remarkable, in many media and academic circles, the monsters who committed the atrocities in Soviet Russia —led by Lenin, Trotsky, Stalin, Kaganovich, Beria and others—are often adored, being cast in a favorable light. This is especially true of Lenin and, to a lesser extent, the theoretical, so-called \"founder\" of Communist ideology, the German Karl Marx. Communist Leaders of Jewish Bloodline The reason why the Western media, owned and run as it is by Jewish interests, fails to expose the Communist butchery is easy to discern. The instigators and leaders of Communism were virtually all of the Jewish race and bloodline! The Lenin Museum in Russia today admits that Vladimir Lenin was a crypto-Jew (a \"crypto Jew is a Jew who keeps his race hidden from public knowledge). Trotsky, his deputy in crime and mass murder, was a Jew who had lived in the Bronx, New York under his real name, Lev Bronstein. Stalin, the third leg of the Soviet troika, was half-Jew, and Yiddish was the only language spoken in his boyhood home in Georgia. Stalin's real surname was Dzhugashvilli—Jewish. 2 Karl Marx was a German Jew whose grandfather was a rabbi, and the entire Communist Bolshevik revolution was financed by the Jewish Rothschilds and Jewish Warburgs in Germany, in partnership with the Jewish Warburgs and Jewish Schiffs in the United States. Communism was Jewish from the ground up. Marx's view and his classic texts, The Capitalists and The Communist Manifesto, were ideological expressions of the Jewish Cabala, which is also the basis for Marx's theory of dialectical materialism and economic class evolution, specific throwbacks to Hegelian dialectics and Weishaupt's Illuminism. Albert Pike's writings in Morals and Dogma are also right out of the Jewish Cabala aquarium. It seems that the piranhas, the killer \"fish\" of humanity, all swam in the same polluted pond: Jewish Cabalism and rabbinical magic and despotism. From Lenin to Putin, we have a straight-line succession of Jewish Cabalism under the guise of Communism and now, \"Democratic Capitalism\" under Gorbachev, Yeltsin and Putin. 3 Writing in his provocative, fact-filled expose, Bloodlines of the Illuminati, researcher Fritz Springmeier reveals how incestuously Jewish the rulers of Russia have been, including their spouses. First, he notes that Stalin married the daughter of his number 2 man, the Jew Kaganovich. Also: The wife of Boris Yeltsin is the daughter of Joseph Stalin from Stalin's marriage with Rosa Kaganovich. Rosa's father was Illuminati...Boris Yeltsin and Rosa are secretly Jewish. Lenin was married to a Jewish wife, Krupsakaya. Molotov married a Jewess, too. And Stalin was married to Jewess Kaganovich.

He in turn is a good friend of David Rockefeller. 4 Communism the Invention of Jews So dominant was the Jewish influence in the Communist regime and its bloody Red Terror that Sir Winston Churchill, in the London Illustrated Herald newspaper, stated that, \"Communism was solely the invention of the Jews.\" 5 And, he added, it is not a new thing, for the Jews are historically the people who have fomented bloody revolutions and horrors. Churchill said the Jewish global revolutionary plot can be traced back to the days of Adam Weishaupt and his Bavarian Order of the Illuminati (1776). Churchill went on to emphasize that this \"worldwide conspiracy for the overthrow of civilization, and the reconstruction of society...has been steadily growing.\" Now, he warns, this band of thugs and murders \"have become the undisputed masters of the enormous Russian empire.\" 6 Solzhenitsyn records that over 60 percent of the Commissars who headed Gulag camps in the U.S.S.R. were Jewish. Other historians estimate the number at 80 percent. Every leader of the dreaded Checka, KGB and secret police was Jewish, including the butcher Beria. May Day—Illuminism and Communism It is interesting to note that that Adam Weishaupt, infamous founder of the Illuminati, founded his group on May 1. It was exactly that day that the Communists under Lenin celebrated. Annually on May 1, the huge May Day parade is held in Moscow. Is it a mere accident that the most holy day of paganism and witchcraft, Beltane, is also celebrated on May 1? On that day, in pagan Europe, children and adults celebrated around the phallus symbol known as the May Pole, even as witches howled at the moon. 7 Of Wolves and Freemasons In his expose of Communism, Under the Sign of the Scorpion, Swedish writer and researcher Jiiri Lina, writes how in his last months, a mad Vladimir Lenin, his body and brain racked with the sexually transmitted disease syphilis, demanded each night to be taken out on his balcony in his wheelchair. There, for hours, the angry Lenin would howl and bay at the moon like a wounded wolf. 8 Lenin, Stalin, Marx and all the other top Communist leaders were all Freemasons. Gorbachev, too, and Yeltsin were Masons, members of the Grand Orient Lodge of France as well as the Soviet Consistory. Albert Mackey, 33°, former Sovereign Grand Commander, in his authoritative Encyclopedia of Freemasonry, states that Alexander Kerensky (Lenin's immediate predecessor) and the other plotters of the 1917 revolution against the Czar were"},{"pageNumber":555,"pageContent":"566 CODEX MAGICA Masons: \"The first Revolution in March 1917 is said to have been operated from these (Masonic) Lodges and all the members of Kerensky's government belonged to them.\" 9 All Masonic organizations throughout the world are secretly run by Jewish masters operating behind-the-scenes. 10 I also have documentation to prove that Marx, Lenin, and most other Communist leaders were homosexual perverts. Most, like Beria, were pedophiles as well, and they all enjoyed brutalizing and degrading women. The wives of these homosexual deviants led miserable lives. One of Stalin's wives committed suicide. 11 Signs and Symbols of Communism Seeing as how the Communist founders and leaders have all been apostate Jews into Cabalism, Freemasonry, and blatant satanism (Marx was an official High Priest in a satanic church), we can be sure the signs and symbols of Communism are also of cabalistic/Masonic/satanic origins, as is the color red so fanatically adored by the Communist wackos. Let us now examine these signs and symbols of the Red Murderers, e.g. the Communists. The Clenched Fist In all nations where Communist politicians and insurgents operate, these evil men and women invariably identify themselves by making the sign of the clenched fist. Some biblical authorities say that, \"The clenched fist represents the (rebellious) attitude of the people of Babylon toward God.\" 12 The closed, or clenched fist is, in the Illuminist Philosophy, the symbol of secrecy, dissimulation, and hermeticism. It veils and conceals secrets from the \"profane\" and the \"vulgar\" (the non-Illuminists). Interestingly, the meaning is the same in the canons of Buddhism. 13 Dr. Peter Ruckman, in his fascinating study of things occulticly black and evil, mockingly titled Black is Beautiful, comments about the raised, clenched fist: You will find this 'salute' being given by all members of the Communist Party in New York, in the 1920s and by the (Stalinist) Abraham Lincoln Brigade, during the civil war in Spain in the 1930s. By some quirk of 'fate,' this salute was adopted by the Black Panthers in America during the 1960s...the followers of Martin Luther King called it the 'BLACK POWER'salute. 14 Liberal Afro-American leaders continue to employ this salute to this day. Jesse Jackson does it almost as an automatic response. The clenched fist salute, or hand sign, is well-known in Freemasonry. The First Sign, or Due-guard, in the ritual of the Select Master Degree is the holding up, or raising, of both arms in an \"L\" (square) position with the fists of both hands clenched. The lecture for this degree in Richardson's Monitor of Freemasonry states:"},{"pageNumber":556,"pageContent":"BLOOD RED-RED STARS, CLENCHED FISTS 567 The signs of a Select Master are then given as follows: The first is similar to the sign of a Master Mason. The fists are both clenched, in allusion to one of the penalties of the obligation, which is to have both hands chopped off to the stumps. 15 How interesting. Ironically, according to the Masons, the symbol of the clenched fist relates to having the hand chopped off at the stump. Communists out there: Maybe you should listen to what your cronies in Freemasonry are teaching you. In the initiation for the Secret Monitor Degree of the Lodge, the sign of the clenched fist is given in remarkably similar fashion to the Communist salute, with one hand and arm. Hammer and Sickle The sickle is a universal symbol of the Grim Reaper; that is, a symbol of death. However, the Communists would maintain that the hammer and sickle represent workers, or laborers, the proletariat, or common people whom the Communist leadership represents. Perhaps the hammer has other relevant meanings, however, which are concealed by the satanic Illuminists who sponsored — and continue to sponsor Communism. The Herder Dictionary of Symbols says the hammer \"symbolizes power and strength\" and notes, \"In some cultures magical protective powers against evil are ascribed to ritually forged hammers.\" Every Masonic Lodge has a gavel, or hammer, wielded by the \"Worshipful Master\" or other potentate in charge. In her celebrated dark work, The Secret Doctrine, Theosophy founder Helena Blavatsky reveals that the god of forces (Lucifer) renders the \"divine hammer\" and it is the \"mallet or gavel of the Grand Masters of Masonic Lodges.\" 16 Sarah Terry, a member of the Masonic-aligned group, the Eastern Star, traces the gavel, or hammer, back to the hammer of the Nordic sun god, Thor, and says it is an emblem of power. 17 If we realize that the Illuminati's chief goal is the rebuilding of Babylon in a desperate bid to undo what God did as recorded in the Book of Genesis, the significance of this Bible verse relating to the prophesied destruction of Babylon by God's might becomes clear:"},{"pageNumber":557,"pageContent":"568  CODEX MAGICA A sound of battle is in the land, and of great destruction.

I have examined the occultic meaning of the five-pointed star in previous chapters, so I simply reiterate here that the star is a sign of false gods and specifically of the god of Illuminism, In the Perfect Master Degree, the Masons assembled in the Lodge all simulate the drama of lamenting the mythical death of their \"brother,\" the false Christ-figure, the Grand Master Hiram Abiff.

It became a staple during World War II, under the direction of the Pentagon's \"red brass\" leadership put in place by Zionist fanatic President Franklin D. Roosevelt and his ever watchful guardian, Jewish financier Bernard Baruch.

In pre-Vedic India the people worshipped a primitive form of Shiva as the \"red god\" and as \"the howler.\" The god and planet Mars was known by the ancients as the red god. In Scandinavia, the major god, Odin, had clothing, shield symbols and runes of red color. A hero Viking's death became celebrated on the calendar as a \"red-letter day,\" and thus we have this phrase in common use today. Robin was the god of witches in the forest and when human sacrifices were made, they were dedicated to Robin redbreast, or the slain Cock Robin. Updated to more recent times, we find that in her occult book, A Treatise On The Seven Rays, Lucis Trust director Alice Bailey taught the occult importance of colors. \"The three major rays,\" she said, \"are red, blue, and yellow.\" The color red, Bailey explained, has to do with \"Will, or Power.\" 19 In The Symbolism of Color, Faber Birren points out the primacy of the color red. He notes: 20 • In ancient Egyptian religion, the god Shu was red, and red animals symbolized Seth. • The red poppy was sacred to Ceres, the goddess of the harvest. • The face of the wine-god Dionysus was sometimes painted red. In my researches of occult traditions, the color red is always the color of fire and blood, of evil and destruction, and of immorality. Even the Devil is sometimes conceived of as a red beast. And isn't that what Communism has proven to be—A red beast? Even a Red Dragon?"},{"pageNumber":559,"pageContent":"570 CODEX MAGICA Earl Browder, head of the United States Communist Party for sixteen years (1931- 1946), giving the Communist salute at the 1936 convention.

The most prominent emblem of universal Freemasonry is the square and compass with the letter \"G\" inside the internal triangle. Daniel notes that this represents the tools used by the Lodge's Great Architect (false God) to create the heavens and the earth. In reality, the letter \"G\" represents Gnosticism, the core doctrine of Masonry, and the Generative process (sex act). Masonry is, as Daniel notes, a sex cult. However, English Freemasonry (the United Lodge of Britain) substitutes a human arm wielding a hammer in place of the \"G.\" This arm and hammer represents the Mason as the Builder, as \"man at work\" creating the heavens and the earth. Thus, man becomes God. The arm and hammer is of socialist/communist origins. The same symbol is found on a bestselling brand of baking soda. Noted communist financier and oil corporation CEO Armand Hammer was given his name in honor of the communist movement. Note, too, that the arm and hammer symbol inside the square and compass is configured as a \"G.\" Finally, we come to the modified square and compass of French Freemasonry and its Grand Orient Lodge. This Lodge and its membership are decidedly anti-Christian and are markedly pro-communist. In 1877, the Grand Orient Lodge declared, \"There is no god but humanity.\" Embracing Reason as their God, they replaced the \"G\" with the now-familiar communist symbol of the hammer and sickle. This represents collective common man, the proletariat. John Daniel points out that the French Lodge's substituted symbol inside the typical square and compass forms the letter \"G\" backward, \"which is symbolic of the negation of God.\" It was Albert Pike who wrote, in Morals and Dogma, that there is no real person or entity named \"Satan.\" Pike claimed that Satan is simply a Force, the negation of God.

The design favors that of Mayan pyramids and the ziggurats of Babylon. The site chosen for the Lenin monument was a piece of land on which a closed-down Christian church building sat, the 19th century Cathedral of Christ the Savior. Stalin ordered the church blown up and the debris removed, and it was. However, World War II intervened and the gargantuan, monstrous structure was never completed. At the top of the planned monument, a statue of Lenin was to tower above the people and landscape, his right hand and finger vertically pointed upward toward the heavens.
