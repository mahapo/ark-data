We were more curious about, than frightened by, Adolf Hitler’s Blitz. In about \u00189\u0018 0 , when I was two, a Heinkel bomber crashed in the Blue - bell Woods, and we sometimes picnicked near the wreckage. My older brother John picked over the remains and found a flying boot containing the pilot’s toes. He brought it home with visions of boundless popularity at school arising from this gruesome find; our mother had no such vision, and tossed the boot irritably away (so he tells me now). I do recall that he swore to me at the time that the Heinkel had been piloted by a Red In - dian and a cowboy, and I saw no reason to disbelieve that throughout the war. Exploring those same woods later in the war, or perhaps after, my friends and I came across a bomb dump, a shallow pit filled with frag - ments of bombs, though whether they were British or enemy I don’t know. \u0018"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"banged up \u0018 Later, the fields around our houses were decorated with garlands of tinsel foil, painted matte black; that must have been after the RAF started dropping “ Window”—metal anti-radar foils—on Germany in the sum - mer of \u00189\u00183 , and the Luftwaffe lifted its own foolish embargo on using this secret device. No boy of five or six was accepted by his pals unless he knew and could identify all the Jerry bombers and fighter planes just by the sound of their engines. Playing with the urchins from Hutton Village, we briefly stopped at the sound of airplanes duelling high over our heads; we could not see them, but we knew all about them, those Heinkels and Junkers and Dorn - iers, just as children now have their favourite sneakers or pop stars. The Heinkel \u0018\u0018\u0018 was the workhorse of Hermann Göring’s bomber fleet, it carried the Luftwaffe’s heaviest load; it droned stealthily up the Thames estuary and headed northwest into Essex—the ball-bearing works of the Hoffmann Manufacturing Company was at Chelmsford. Its twin Daimler-Benz 60\u0018 engines ran slightly out of sync; the engine note rose and fell. “Where are you? Where are you? Where are you?” it crooned, or so it seemed to the ear of Graham Greene’s little murderer on the run. \u0004 On mornings in \u00189\u0018\u0018 and \u00189\u00185 we stood on our ragged tennis lawn shading our eyes and peering up at the awesome spectacle of the Flying Fortresses of the U.S. Eighth Air Force glittering high overhead, flying in perfect box formation as they circled over East Anglia to gain height and set course for Germany. Later we would see the same squadrons return, with some planes missing from the box but the rest still holding tight formation. Death meant nothing to us children. I had a soft-plastic black model of a Stirling bomber—a Lancaster would have been worth more. We bought and bartered such things by swapping them for marbles or prize conkers. For my American and other readers unfamiliar with the English autumn schoolyard “conkers” are highly polished horse-chestnuts pierced with a short length of string, and used in one-on-one combat: one boy dangles his conker, the opponent’s object is to smash it with one swing of his. Of course we experimented with various performance-enhancing chemicals like vinegar, rumoured \u0004 Ministry of Fear (London, \u00189\u0018\u0018 )."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"3 The War We Infants Had to harden the nut to invincibility. The other, less belligerent, schoolyard game was marbles, played with dime- or quarter-sized coloured glass balls. Recollections of the war are few but vivid: I saw a V- \u0018 doodlebug, a flying bomb, a buzz bomb—it was called all these things—growling one night swiftly across my field of vision, from left to right, as I stood on tiptoes and looked out of our bathroom window one evening in \u00189\u0018\u0018 ; it must have been about a mile away and running quite low. The V- \u0018 s impacted all over the Essex countryside; one “came down” near Mountnessing, another half a mile away from us. On the way up to church that Sunday we visited the crater near the Hutton village school: around the rim lay scattered the tangled wires and metal of this contrap - tion. As distant detonations rattled the house and windows, cracks ap - peared in the ceiling. It was of course nothing compared with what life in the cities must have been like; in retrospect, it is hard to imagine the anguish that a mother of four children, separated from her husband who is away at sea, must have felt every time she heard the planes or V- \u0018 s go - ing over. We children certainly had no fears. We slept at night in the rusty steel Morrison shelter—a solid table of sheet steel and angle-iron—which had been painted with a kind of pink distemper and covered with a tablecloth to serve as a table by day. If the house had collapsed, we would have been safe inside. from all around the silent horizon, that summer of \u00189\u0018\u0018 , day and night, there emerged this deep penetrating tone, a kind of animal growl on one single frequency, and we infants huddled in the Morrison shelter and waited out the five minutes of suspense which that rumbling sound pushed ahead of it. We six-year olds knew the ritual by now. Out here in the country we heard every sound that these weapons, the V- \u0018 s, made. No sirens sounded. Their own organ note heralded their approach. We hadn’t been frightened by the stories of butterfly-bombs; we had rather liked the Christmas festoons of long silver paper strips that the planes dropped over our hedges and fields; but the V- \u0018 was different and evil."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"banged up \u0018 After a minute or so, as the speeding weapon came into sight—too fast for any but the new Meteor jets to catch, and those we never saw—the full roar of its engine came, vibrating through the trees and across the cornfields, louder and deeper than the deepest double-diapason note of which our village church organ was capable. The V- \u0018 ’s Argus Tube, a simple pulse-jet engine, was built in the un - derground Mittelwerk plant near Nordhausen, captured by US forces in \u00189\u00185. If you caught sight of the evil thing, it was scudding at low altitude across the sky in a straight line, a stab of flame streaking behind its en - gine. Usually the robot just carried on in a straight line—it had no pilot to be daunted by ground fire; but there were times when the weapon’s heart-throb suddenly cut out. Six-year-olds don’t fear death. I’ll say it again; but our mother and every adult around us must have prayed to the Lord each time that en - gine note cut out. Every one of us knew that you counted twenty-five as the missile hurtled down in its silent death-glide to the ground. Then it detonated with a sudden white flash—against which all the trees and animals and houses on the horizon were silhouetted in black, even in daytime. It was an illusion of some kind, but I always thought I heard a shower of glass follow the bang. It was that, being sliced by the broken glass, that the younger women most feared. (Government studies showed this: I wrote about it all, twenty years later, compiling the biography of the German field marshal who had sent these weapons over to us. Their one ton warhead carried an aluminized explosive that packed twice the punch of tnt .) Other than the low jungle growl of the distant pilotless V- \u0018 s, no sound recalls for me the years of World War Two as does the English air raid siren. It had its own accent. I’ve heard sirens since then from Illinois (tor - nado warning) to Austria (prison breakout) and they leave me unmoved; but the ghostly lament of the \u00189\u0018 0 s English siren, actually two tones work - ing in incongruous tin-whistle harmony, is hard-wired into our genera - tion’s memories. Like the V- \u0018 engine it still halts my heart when I hear it in old BBC recordings.

After covering nine hundred kilometers during the night on empty freeways, I was in Vienna by eight a.m. As soon as it was decent, I phoned Christopher V., my student host, from the West Vienna railroad station. “ Rendezvous A,” I said, without identifying myself. “One hour from now.” We had prearranged the details six months earlier. Security like this was necessary. The last time I spoke in Vienna, on November 6 , \u0018989 , the far Left organisations had brought five thousand demonstrators out into the capital’s streets; five hundred riot police had had to put a ring of steel around the big Park Hotel and, it turned out, an arrest warrant had since been issued.

I knew what signs to look for. Five minutes after the hour I strolled outside to check whether anybody was prowling round the rental car. A young student in his twenties emerged from the station and we made eye contact. I nodded with my head towards the car and we drove off down the Ring, with him at the wheel. I wanted to check him out before we went further. “Let’s get a coffee at the Café Landtmann,” I suggested, in a fit of nostalgia. That was where I was arrested at a press conference on the orders of Minister of the Interior Karl Blecha on June \u00186 , \u001898 \u0018 . It cost him dear; we were awarded heavy damages. It was like yesterday. “You’re speaking at six,” the student said. I needed sleep, I had been driving all night. He agreed that I could put my head down at the Bur - schenschaft building for three or four hours’ sleep first. Still half suspecting that the function might not take place, I asked him to grab a snapshot under the Landtmann’s canopy as proof that I was in Vienna. It would certainly irritate some folks back in London. The Board of Deputies of British Jews had written in June \u001899\u0018 to the Austrian government, livid at hearing of a recent visit by me to the country, and demanding my immediate arrest the next time. Some “Britons”! I had obtained a copy of their letter during a court action against the Prime Minister of Australia, no less.

Phrases from Raymond Chandler skid - ded through my brain. What would Philip Marlowe have done? In their early forties, they were burly, stubble-faced and wearing weatherproof jackets—they were hard to place.

After a moment’s hesitation, they crossed the street diagonally towards us. Ignoring them, we walked right through them. “ Mahlzeit ,” I nodded: Good afternoon. “Let’s drop into that Kneipe ,” I murmured to the stu - dent—the bar on the next corner. “Too late,” he said, dropping the car keys furtively back into my hand. “They’re following. I recognize one. Staatspolizei !” I doubted it. How could he know the Stapo by sight? This was no time for “The Long Goodbye.” We split at the corner. Briefly out of sight of the goons, I quickened my pace. The rental Ford Focus was round the next corner. The men had split up. One was follow - ing me, a hundred yards behind; two were pursuing the law student. Round the final corner I speeded up again, walking briskly in the middle of the street, not visibly aiming for anything. I pressed the remote, and heard the soft answering clunk of the car doors unlocking. I ripped open the front right hand door and dropped into the seat, and locked the door. The goon was ninety yards away, and he had begun to trot. Suppos - ing he took out a gun? My hands reached for the steering column—but the wheel wasn’t there. It was not a British car. It was Swiss. I was on the wrong side. Jeez, you’re getting senile, or perhaps you just needed that sleep. Drive all night, and this is what happens. Your brain clouds over. Impossible to climb across the centre console. Fifty yards away the man broke into a run.

I caught a glimpse of him in the mirror, and what I saw was not good. He had a pad in his hand, and he was writing. So he was Staatspolizei , as Christopher had said.

So I stuck with the car, and it was travelling fast. I took the next four corners on two wheels. It should be easy to submerge in Vienna, I was thinking. I could not get this zither music out of my head—The Harry Lime Theme. I wanted to put distance between myself and those burly men, because in this scenario they were definitely not the Good Guys. I am a professional, and I have never let down an audience yet. I parked back at the rendezvous point, and cautiously phoned the law stu - dent. “Shall we meet in an hour’s time,” I suggested, “at that place you took the photo?” “I don’t think that would be advisable,” he muttered. “You can’t speak?” “No.” He was in Staatspolizei custody?

I assumed that all routes due west out of Vienna would be watched, if they were really looking out for me. It still seemed hard to believe, after sixteen years. After all, these are the much vaunted “free democracies”.

After another hour, a second police car showed up in my rear- view mirror, and I was not so sure. They both maintained my exact speed, no matter how I modestly slowed or accelerated. Using the standard “box” manœuvre—a simple “please” would have sufficed—they suddenly forced me off the freeway at speed, and halted me on the hard shoulder in a cloud of dust and gravel. As the other traffic sped past inches away in the darkness, eight uni - formed cops jumped out and began running towards me, shouting hys - terically. I do so hate unpleasantness.

Welcome to Jakomini jail, southern Austria: suicide was the only other way out. I had often wondered what drove men to that. In Vienna’s jail, there were quite a few suicides, it turned out, though the newspa - pers were not told: two prisoners hanged themselves in our block in the last two weeks I was there, probably newcomers, because it is in the first two weeks that despair turns to desperation. The whole block was locked down all day without exercise, so that nobody would learn what had hap - pened. “Don’t do it, Dave,” urged Bernhard rather superfluously, the day af - ter I was transferred back to Vienna. He was an armed car hijacker—he had got seven years, because his accomplice, a Jugo, was carrying a gun. “Nobody is impressed, and they (the screws, I mean) just laugh among themselves afterwards.” I had no intention of doing it. I reasoned to myself that the prison staff were kindly shutting the whole outside world out for me; in fact, I thanked them pointedly each time they closed the door, and sometimes if they lingered I asked them if they would be so good as to oblige. I was in control. Others might go mad, but I would not. Many already were mad, and visibly belonged in a mental institution, not jail. One old man displayed his madness by walking clockwise round the yard—in prison, all prisoners walk anti-clockwise—or he stood in a corner, head bowed like a small boy being punished; or he walked around stooping and clawing up sodden fag-ends from the muddy ground. I regarded this whole new world, this submerged world, this world behind strong-room doors and steel bars, in the same way that Jacques Cousteau would have regarded a new ocean bed. I decided I would spend the months, perhaps even years, exploring this microcosm and recording every detail of the fauna I encountered (of flora there were none: no—once I did find a dandelion in the yard, and I grabbed it before it was trampled by the shuffling crowd of eastern European and Balkan prisoners, and I mailed it to a lady in Hungary who had come to visit me). “You see them all in the papers when you’re outside,” philosophised Bernhard, an otherwise likeable Austrian, referring to our fellow prison - ers. “But only for a few weeks: the murderers, bank robbers, hijackers,"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"\u00183 dealers.

It seemed an odd message. “ Copenhagen,” I repeated. “She’s Danish.” I did not explain. Copenhagen was the codeword we had arranged; Bente was to watch for it. However it was used—if I said it to a journalist, or on TV, or on a postcard message, it meant I had been arrested and was unable to contact her, and she was to take certain steps.

The Government now had to admit that yes, the British historian was being held in one of their jails, though no charges had yet been brought. some magazines and newspapers incuding Der Spiegel suggested that I had expected to be arrested, that I had been out to provoke; they might see the codeword Copenhagen preparation was proof. In fact I was always steeled for the worst: I was a Boy Scout in my youth, and be prepared was on our belt-buckle, just as some Germans, including Günter Grass as it now turns out, had meine ehre heisst treue embossed on theirs. To illustrate this, let me give a parallel example. In the earlier years of my marriage, which lasted twenty years, we travelled from England to Germany by the North Sea ferry, because we could not afford to fly. I secretly took a two-meter length of cord with me, in case the ferry sank: then I could tie our lifejackets together, and we would not drift apart. I never expected the ferry to sink, but I was prepared. (I never told my wife. I sometimes wondered whether she might have taken a pair of scissors if I had).

The veterans knew all about our transport’s history— the Krokodil had been bought from Germany, where it had been declared illegal and unsafe because of the holocaust that would occur if it caught fire or ran off the road. Only the officers would get out alive.

After a few months it was easy to believe we were nowhere near Vienna, just as it is hard to accept that the museums and Harrods are up above, as your underground train passes through South Kensington and Knightsbridge stations. A few days later I was escorted before the custodial judge, a Dr. Peter Seda. He had a falsetto voice of such a high pitch that the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung made fun of it in its opening words of a report on my arrest. To use Graham Greene’s words, “He was like a Pekinese who has been insulted by an Alsatian.” His voice rose to an indignant squeak when I replied in frank terms to his more inane questions during this interrogation. He asked what lec - ture I had planned to deliver to the students in Vienna.

Although the new lawyer admitted that Schaller was far better informed on the Banning Law than he, and had handled innumerable cases, Dr. Kresbach refused to sit at the same table as him or even to listen to, let alone accept, advice from him.

In consultation with me the President of the Central Criminal Court, Vienna, Dr. Ulrike Psenner has on this occasion waived the current ban on filming and photography for the Grand Jury Court - room, so that before the trial begins we must expect a corresponding onslaught by camera teams and news photographers, who will all thereafter have to be cleared from the courtroom in order not to delay the start of the main proceedings too long. Particularly with this trial it is especially difficult to assess the special interest of individual members of the audience or what specific “camp” they may belong to. The fact is that the prisoner has been receiving hundreds of letters and cards every month from all over the world, which are to be counted without exception as letters of support. We cannot even begin to estimate how far this interest in the various camps will translate into personal attendance at the trial. For this reason, we request the transmittal of the above request with special urgency coupled with a plea for contact to be established, as various points ought to be clarified well in advance. For example, whether there should be an additional entrance—security check, coupled perhaps with procuring the personal ID details of every single member of the public—and whether the gallery to the Grand Jury Courtroom ought not in fact to be left closed to the public for better security and surveillance operations. At the very least, taking into account the innumerable pages on the Internet on the subject of the trial—at times the keyword “David Irving” yielded over 9 million hits (URLs) every day—we may in any case be faced with operations to disrupt during and before the main trial.

An escort squad fetched me from the cell to a room where I was body- searched and handcuffed. The Mont Blanc pen was handed back to me, and Hitler’s War too when I explained it was “ evidence”. A phone card was confiscated. Dumped in the holding tank just outside the courtroom, I re-read a story by P. G. Wodehouse. I could hear a hubbub coming through the closed doors of the court - room. The police guards had courteously left the cell door open. I had enough wriggle-room to smooth down my four-month growth of hair and to force my handcuffed hands into the blazer pocket and to extract and open the pen. As they fetched me out, the towering escort-squad commander no - ticed the glint of the pen’s Gold nib and challenged, “What’s that?” “My trademark,” I said. “I’m a writer.” He let it go. Through a slit between the double doors I could see the television and press photographers gathering on the other side, facing the door: row upon row, tier upon tier, like a school group photograph in reverse, jostling and jockeying, standing on chairs and stools, waiting for their target to emerge. I held up book and pen, checked my fingers, shook my blazer sleeves back so that the manacles were fully exposed and stepped through the doors carrying the book at shoulder height.

The seven grim ladies hung on his every word; I looked at my defence attorney, Kresbach. He had languidly picked up a felt pen and scribbled one large word diagonally across a yellow American-style legal pad; I could not read what it was from where I sat. His speech notes? Was that all? It might as well have been a shopping reminder. “Toilet paper.” When Klackl finished, Kresbach levered himself up, tossed a lick of hair off his forehead, and began to speak in a rambling, drawling Viennese that was more conversational than forceful, ignoring every point that Klackl had made. He ignored too the list of arguments in mitigation of a possible sen - tence that I had prepared—for example that if I was sentenced to prison Bente could not visit me, as she was chronically ill, nor could I be ex - changed to a prison in London, as this facility was available only for offences with identical laws in England. The Banning Law was unique. Instead, he lectured the ladies about the differences between Sections 3(g) and 3(h) of that law. One yawned, the others closed their eyes.

I delivered to him two short and forceful lessons on How to Speak in Public: stand up, speak up, and shut up, that was one; and, say what you’re going to say, say it, and then say what you’ve said. He seemed incapable of public speaking; perhaps he was out of his depth in the spacious hall, or overawed by the omnipresent media and the size of the audience.

He asked me to set out the process by which I had updated my views on Auschwitz, since \u0018989 . I began by saying that it would take three or four minutes, and explained the first two stages—securing the Adolf Eichmann papers while visiting Buenos Aires in 1991, and finding Hans Aumeier’s manuscripts (he was deputy commandant of Auschwitz) the year after that. After thirty seconds, Liebetreu wearily interrupted and that was that. After this evidence phase, Prosecutor Klackl again rose to his feet and began reading out extracts from my writings since \u0018989 , and he referred to my hundreds of lectures around the world as compounding my felony.

Once or twice I looked up at the clock at the back of the hall. It was already five p.m. The jury retired, I was escorted into a holding cell. Like any Anglo- Saxon jury, the eight jurors now deliberated on my guilt. Since Kresbach had advised a guilty plea, it was a formality, but they could still have found me not guilty, and if they had known all the facts they might well have—for instance, that the police had agreed with us in advance in \u0018989 on what I was permitted to say, and had stated afterwards that I had re - mained within those guidelines.

I will ask my attorney what the sentence is, on the way out.” This little pas de deux concluded the whole farce. Justice was not only not being seen to be done, it could not be heard either. Slapping me sympathetically on the shoulder as I was escorted away, because he had noticed the television lights come on again, Kresbach told me that the jury had sentenced me to three years’ jail, and that uncon - ditionally, unbedingt ; i.e. , without remission.

But there it was in the proto - col, and there was nothing we could now do about it. More disturbing to me when I glanced much later at the document—I labour under a profound distaste of all such judicial papers—was what I found tagged on at the end: here were four print-outs of newspaper arti - cles privately downloaded by Judge Liebetreu in the days before the trial, all from distinctly left-wing sources: he had even printed out the lengthy and very unfriendly entry about me in the German Wikipedia, the in - formal Internet encyclopedia, blissfully ignoring that while it referenced a dozen other websites attacking me, it dared not give even the address of my own website, as it unashamedly stated, “for legal reasons.” As for the other articles he had read, the Süddeutsche Zeitung for ex - ample had printed a raving article by Eva Menasse, a young Jewish jour - nalist. We had met several times during the Lipstaadt trial in London in 2000, and I rather liked her. On behalf of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung , Menasse had covered the action and had even written the first of seven books published about it.

For several nights there came from the cell next door, Number \u00180 , the doleful singing of a gypsy, who chanted Romany laments out of the window until long after midnight each night. Under different circum - stances it might have been inspiring, but now it was not. the days all melted in retrospect into a grey, seamless blur. Occasionally the door would be thrown open by a jailer, with one word: “ Anwalt !” or “ Besuch !” “Anwalt” meant a three-hour excursion up to the second floor, and being held in that stinking, smoke-filled holding tank with the sad graf - fiti scrawled on its walls—“ hang in there, Sisi—your Teddy-Bear ”— until Dr. Kresbach drifted in for his regular five-minute chat—he never seemed to discuss tactics or the appeal however—and then back into the tank again to wait for the escort back to my cell and whatever I had been writing. “ Besuch ” was a visitor. The very first visitor, just after the newspa - pers revealed my arrest, was quite unexpected—the once-beautiful and elegant lady to whom I have already referred, now a cripple and in her sixties. I indicated the telephone in front of her and she picked it up. Disconcertingly she greeted me with the words, “Do you recognize me?” At my hesitant nod she prompted, “Brigitte.” “Brigitte Müller!” I exclaimed—her married name now is different; she smiled a hesitant smile, pleased that I had remembered her name after all these years.

My mind flipped back to a morning all those years ago when the light had flashed on in my Grosvenor Square bedroom, and Pilar had shouted angrily: “Who is Brigitte Müller?” Yes, I had received a letter from Brigitte, many months after that train trip, but it was seven pages long, handwrit - ten in German, and I had tucked it into a pocket to read later. “I was going through your pockets,” cried Pilar, “and I found this!” Comfortable in the knowledge that the letter’s contents, whatever they might be, were in German, I spluttered that this was the girl I had told her about that summer—quite harmless. “Then how do you explain,” she challenged, “her final sentence?” Final sentence? I hadn’t even read the letter’s first. Brigitte, it turned out, had no doubt with all the innocence of youth closed her letter by writing a sentence in English—a sentence which I re - called vividly, as I smiled at the elderly lady now facing me at Josefstadt: “ This Christmas I am going to be a ski instructor in the Tyrol ,” I quoted to her through the telephone. “ Why don’t you come, and I will teach you a thing or two .” Her face flickered briefly with delight, but how the years had changed us both.

Once a month the shout “ Besuch! ” was amplified by the smiling officer: “— and it’s Réka!” She was a young Hungarian widow, a flight attendant with Malev whose father had read my books.

Réka regularly brought me gifts from her distant destinations like Damascus, or Tokyo, or Beijing.

I made a non-committal reply—I was not familiar with Vienna politics, I said; this did not prevent him from putting those evil words into my mouth when he published his article in The Independent (London) a few days later. He knew I could hardly stop him. He could get away with it. Other journalists who interviewed me committed the opposite sin, that of omission. When my statements did not accord with what they had expected me to say, or with the line they intended to adopt, and in which their editors had no doubt instructed them, they simply left out what I said. This happened when two journalists from Die Presse , a quality Vienna newspaper, and the Austrian Press Agency visited me to - gether one morning, and interviewed me at length—and with difficulty, as they had only one phone between them for communication through that tiny soundproof window in the visitors’ zone. What they published was very damaging and led ultimately to fresh investigations against me. Fortunately Michael Klackl was a conscien - tious prosecutor, and he researched his new case thoroughly. In the court file I discovered, months later, the original manuscript notes of both journalists, and these contained key sentences which I had actually spoken, and which they had for whatever reason refrained from using. For example: “Nobody in their right mind can deny that the Nazis did kill millions of Jews,” I had carefully stated. There was no sign of this in their printed reports. I was a “ Holocaust denier.” They themselves had said so, and nothing must be allowed to disturb that image. I had also described how I had been held incommunicado by the au - thorities, unable to contact anybody, just as the Gestapo used to with its method of Nacht und Nebel —Night and Fog; and I referred to the order of Austria’s minister of justice, Frau Gastinger, that all of my books were to be withdrawn from the prison libraries of Austria and destroyed— books published by Ullstein, Hoffmann & Campe, Bertelsmann, and other leading publishers. Die Presse published my tart comment, “ österreich benimmt sich wie ein ns-staat ”—Austria is acting like a Nazi state—as a headline across a whole page, but not my preceding remark about Nacht und Nebel and the Government order to burn my books.

Using the payphone in a room at the end of our cell-block, I had put a call through to Sky Television News in London at their request; as soon as their news desk heard my name they announced, “Hang on a second, and we’ll put you on live”—and thus I found myself speaking to the mil - lions from that little phone cell in Josefstadt. Satellites carried voice and image around the world. I spoke until my phone card ran out. Boosted by this achievement, the next time I got a phone card I spoke to Independent Television News, the biggest news channel in England, and then to the BBC’s “Today” programme, their major morning radio show. The latter fifteen-minute talk with Kirstie Mackenzie was perhaps a mistake; the BBC posted the audio recording on their website, and the Staatspolizei in Vienna were later able to use it against me. The notion of free speech, for which the British—and the BBC—had fought so valiant - ly in World War Two, still seemed foreign to some minds in Austria.

In Austria it is illegal to say such things, it appears. The truth is no de - fence against the Verbotsgesetz . Unfortunately, my routine warning that “Nobody in their right mind can deny that the Nazis did kill millions of Jews,” was edited out when the BBC trimmed down the recording for their hugely popular Internet website, which left my subsequent remark, “Nobody can excuse that,” as a non-sequitur, orphaned and adrift. The upshot was ugly. The Austrian press reported with instant fury on my mischievous prison broadcasts. More questions were asked in the Viennese Parliament. For several days the whole “C” Trakt had its tele - phone privileges withdrawn—it was perhaps fortunate that my fellow inmates did not know whom they had to thank for this. From the Min - istry of Justice emanated a decree dated March 6 , \u0018006 , forbidding David Irving any further use of the telephone or visits from journalists. The decree was formally handed to me in my cell one day, and I had to sign for it.

It could"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"69 now only get worse. The new court file revealed that Klackl demanded that I be charged under Section 3 ( h ) of the Verbotsgesetz, not 3 ( g ) as I had been before: 3 ( h ) carried a minimum sentence of five years, and maximum of ten or even twenty years, with a possible life sentence for “dangerous repeat offenders”. My lawyer Kresbach now remained mute. He was out of his depth. I was aghast. I slowly began to perceive where this particular jour - ney was heading. I was in enemy hands. They could do with me as they wished. The light which had flickered dimly three years ahead, at the end of the darkened prison tunnel, now seemed to have gone out altogether. by mid April \u0018006 I was uncomfortably aware that the deadline to lodge our appeal was approaching, and my lawyer Dr. Kresbach had done nothing to discuss the documents with me. Through the prison grape - vine I learned that he had in fact assured the prosecution that he was not going to make the serious appeal, the nullity appeal, at all; it was a fun - damental decision, but since he had not mentioned it to me I discounted the rumours. The appeal documents against the original three-year sentence had to be served by April \u0018\u0018 , \u0018006 , otherwise I was in for the long haul. Wor - ried by Kresbach’s inactivity, I wrote a letter to Dr. Herbert Schaller, the veteran lawyer who had seen me through the Munich battles of the early \u0018990 s, and asked him to come and see me. Schaller declared himself willing to clean up the mess that Kresbach was making, assuming that I could somehow raise the money to pay his fees. “I am an old man, Mr. Irving,” he said, “and I must live on my earn - ings as a criminal defence attorney.” It was fair enough. He started work, still unofficially. Kresbach, he said, had refused to consult him during the earlier trial, or even have him sit at the same table in court. The next time Schaller saw me he revealed that Kresbach had not signed on to read the court file since November \u0018005 , although many new documents had been added to it since then. I was dumbfounded. I asked Dr. Schaller to see me again that after - noon, and tackled Kresbach about it that midday, Thursday April \u00183 . “How far have you got with the appeal papers?” I asked.

The papers have to be filed in court by next weekend. You have had two months since the trial ended, and you have not even started. You’re fired.” I rose and called for the escort to take me back to the holding tank. “ Schaller has never won in the court of appeal!” Kresbach cried out truculently as I closed the door of the attorney interview room. That too was untrue. “Arrant nonsense!” snarled Schaller when I told him an hour later. I signed him back on that same day. as I looked at this wiry, white haired, bull-terrier of a lawyer, I felt sud - denly encouraged. We might just win after all. That day, April \u00183 , \u0018006 , I signed the formal document replacing Dr. Elmar Kresbach with Dr. Herbert Schaller as my lawyer. He would con - duct all the further appeals. It was a fateful, possibly even fatal, decision: the Austrian judges might have no greater love for Schaller than did their British counterparts for me. That same day, over in the offices of the Public Prosecutor, at the other end of this large prison complex, prosecutor Michael Klackl had also signed a document—he had now formally lodged his appeal against the three-year sentence. It was too low, he said, and he demanded that it be increased. It was like old times. Herbert Schaller was now eighty-three, but he was an expert, knowledgeable, and more vigorous than a lawyer half his age. As we shook hands and parted, little dots of red lit up his cheeks, be - traying his excitement. I remembered one officer’s description of Field- Marshal Erwin Rommel returning to fight his last battle in Tunisia in \u00189\u00183 —his mystery illness suddenly gone, reacting like a horse that has heard the distant bleat of the hunting horn.

In April \u00189\u0018\u0018 , a few weeks after the Nazis marched into Hungary, SS- Sturmbannführer Adolf Eich - mann had established contact with the Jewish leaders in Budapest and proposed a bargain: if they supplied to him a large sum of money, or alternatively ten thousand trucks for use, or so he promised, only on the eastern front, then he would spare one million Hungarian Jews from deportation to Auschwitz. The first six hundred could be released di - rectly to Palestine as a demonstration of good faith, the rest would go to America. We still cannot determine from the archives how sincerely the offer was meant; I personally suspect it was a Machiavellian attempt by the Reichsführer SS Heinrich Himmler to drive a wedge between London, Washington, and Moscow. Leaving his wife and children behind in Budapest as hostages, the Hungarian Jewish community leader Joel Brand flew to Istanbul in a German courier plane, carrying details of the offer and taking a Jew who was a Gestapo agent with him. They were soon intercepted by British In - telligence in Syria, and Brandt spent the next months in British captivity in Cairo; he was released but only into Palestine in August \u00189\u0018\u0018 , by which time it was too late to save the Hungarian Jews. 7\u0018"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"73 What made the story I had to tell—which is relatively well known to historians—unique was that while researching for my Winston Church - ill and Himmler biographies I had discovered in the British archives the evidence that the British codebreakers, who were experts in decoding Hebrew and German SS messages, had quietly watched the whole epi - sode from their Intelligence bases in England and Palestine: the archives in London contained scores of intercepts of the actual code messages exchanged between Brand and his lieutenants, and the Jewish Agency representatives in Switzerland and Turkey and Palestine. I had transcripts of the intercepts with me when I was arrested. One for example was a Hebrew message, containing many Hebrew codewords, sent by Nathan Schwalb in Switzerland to the “Committee” in Istanbul, reporting the latest message brought by courier from Hungary: I received the letter from Joel [Brand] on the \u00185 th April [ \u00189\u0018\u0018 ] through a messenger. Willi [Wilhelm, the codename for Eichmann] is with him with his plan. . . They succeeded in postponing the deportation and got an answer that in principle there is no objection to the emigration [to Palestine] of 600 persons and to an emigration to Arye [the U.S.]. In view of the fact that Wilhelm is in favour of an emigration [of the Hungarian Jews] to Arye, it is indispensable that Tartskower [the American Government] should confirm that he is prepared to receive them.

Twenty percent of the prisoners are Blacks; most of them told me—in whatever language we could agree on, English, Span - ish, or French—that they had been tricked into coming to Europe and longed to return to their villages in West Africa. About ten percent of the prisoners belonged in secure hospitals, and not in jail at all. At any one time in our yard I could see two or three mentally-ill prisoners, or prisoners pretending to be ill. Other prisoners were quite obviously innocent, and were it not for the need to provide employment to this overstaffed prison complex and its lawyers I could not see why they were being held here at all. Under Austrian law however prisoners are guilty until they can prove their innocence—not an easy task for the unfortunates held be - hind bars, denied access to phones, and forced to use court-appointed lawyers who could not care less about their clients. One such prisoner was Sal, an elegant, upright, elderly Albanian, one of the leaders of the Kosovo liberation movement. He brought his police file into the yard one day for me to read. He and a friend had legally collected two million euros, around \u0018 · 3 million dollars, to buy arms for the Kosovo liberation movement; a middl eman had relieved them of the money, undertaking to procure the arms from a Russian source. They never saw the arms, or their cash, again. After the Kosovo war ended, they angrily insisted on the money’s return; the swindler turned them in to the police, alleging that they had “demanded money with menaces.” It was clear to even the meanest intelligence that Sal had been set up by his accuser, and the police should have seen that too. Over the next four months I watched as he became a physical ruin. He stooped, his hair became bedraggled, his suit was ruined by the weather; his eyes were hollow and his face gaunt with worry about his family, as he faced the last years of his life in jail while the swin dler laughed up his sleeve at him."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"75 One Tuesday he was missing from the yard, and I feared the worst, that he hanged himself.

Without rancour or hatred— sine ira et studio —just the way I was taught at school. two or three times a month, a dozen of us were escorted through the prison corridors to the little Evangelical chapel on the fourth floor, for a strange religious ceremony conducted partly in English and partly in German, and enlivened by Austrian hymns and African tribal songs in - cluding the Kum-Ba-Ya chant. The two pastors became my firm friends—both were actually Ger - man-born, not Austrians—and some afternoons they visited me in my cell. One day one of them, Mathias Geist, came into my cell looking more than ticked off, and spluttering harsh and even unchristian words about Viennese judges. I asked him why. “Seven thousand euros,” he said. “That’s why.” A Viennese newspaper had quoted him as criticizing the city’s judges in general, for their rudeness towards witnesses in court. I interrupted to remark that British judges, on the contrary, leaned over backwards to be courteous, and showed an exaggerated politeness and deference to both the witnesses and the jury. Mathias clenched his hands. One of the Vienna judges, he said, Frau Magister Nathalie Fröhner, had charged him with defamation, üble Nachrede , because of this newspaper article; even though he had not mentioned her by name, she had taken his criticism personally. A conviction for üble Nachrede —a civil offence in Britain, but criminal in Austria—would have cost him his living as a pastor. She had suggested an out-of-court settlement.

Yeah, right, I can just see me tattooing one of these gangsters.

Today less, as I spent three hours on the \u0018 nd floor firing my old lawyer, and signing up my new one—Dr. Herbert Schaller, who will fight the appeal in \u0018 – 3 months’ time. We have to lodge the documents on the appeal in ten days’ time and we have Easter in between. The original lawyer did not inspire me with any confidence any more. Very weak. As I was taken out of the courtroom [on February \u00180 , \u0018006 ] I said, “I am shocked”, when asked by TV reporters: In fact I was shocked at how weak he had been!

I have read a lot of Raymond Chandler and Mickey Spillane”—both American thriller writers. Schaller did not let me down. A few days later I reported to a friend in London, Lady Renouf: We served our appeal documents just on time, April \u0018\u0018 ; the State Pros - ecutor has also served a rather lame notice of appeal, demanding an increase in the three-year sentence. He has pointed to my “hundreds of lectures around the world” in justification; of course, this pretends that Austria’s Banning Law is in force in all those countries too (in fact it holds force only in Austria); and it also pretends that I was talking about the Holocaust and praising the Nazis in all these lectures."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"79 This too is absurd, as my audiences know I talk about Churchill, Poland, Sikorski, atomic research, Rommel, and Hungary’s Revolution of \u0018956 , to mention just a few topics.

The women were in for a shock. In the weekly discussion group we speculated on how long it would be before Helmut Elsner, former CEO of the Bawag Bank, would turn up and join us; the elderly Austrian millionaire, under whose regime the trades-union bank had, ahem, mislaid a billion euros, was fighting ex - tradition from France at that time.

The dogs are now threatening to destroy the rest. I feel very powerless in situations like this. The London lawyers I hired turned out to be yet another firm of do-nothing deadbeats like the one I first had here (and fired).

The prison system was almost designed to feed off it - self. Prisoners became institutionalized; they found it difficult to shake it off when released. Everything militated against their escaping re-ar - rest. They were caught in a vicious circle, an overwhelming vortex. I asked my neighbor in C-Block, Momo, a Gambian, what he would do when released. “Go back to driving a taxi,” he said hopefully, flashing his teeth in a bright smile. “No you won’t,” I educated him, passing on what wisdom other pris - oners had imparted to me. “Unless you write now to somebody to come and get your driving license out of your possessions in the Depot.

Like them, you came to regard prison as home: no taxes to pay, no family worries, three meals a day. Occasionally I noticed that a face which had vanished some months earlier had reappeared—“I done it again,” the fellow would say careless - ly, in this case a Turkish drug dealer who had earlier been a Hausarbeiter in our block. “What else could I live off?” “I got as far as Slovenia,” said another, an otherwise likeable chap who had robbed a bank. “You done a runner?” I exclaimed, using the prison argot for es - caped—I am a linguist, after all, and High German doesn’t go down too well in the yard.

Provided that I could get the documents I needed I would also resume drafting my life of the Reichsführer SS, Heinrich Himmler—this strange character of Hitler’s Reich, who lived only forty-four years but achieved so much that was both grotesque and spectacular—building an industrial empire, creating a vast and intricate police state, and rais - ing from scratch the Waffen SS, the most formidable fighting force that history had ever known—at the same time as being the evil executor of what is now called the Holocaust. To my pleasure and surprise, the world’s leading history institutes rallied round, whether in Munich or in Princeton, and sent me the files I requested, “under the circumstances” without charge—circumstances which they universally deplored.

Computers or laptops were not allowed to us re - mand prisoners awaiting trial. I always write in ink anyway, and I had my fountain pen with me— though not my favourite Mont Blanc; I had written many of my early books with the Mont Blanc which the late Field Marshal Er - hard Milch had bequeathed to me after I compiled his biography. When the pen became faulty, I sent it to Mont Blanc for repair, and the firm very kindly, as they thought, replaced it with a brand new pen, as the old one was, they explained, “an antique.” At first I wrote on the back of prison regulations and envelopes. Later, I got paper sent in, and I eventually wrote four thousand pages during the months of my imprisonment. Ink cartridges were still a problem. For weeks while I had to write in pencil my friends around the world mailed packets of car - tridges to me, but they were all confiscated—with the covering letters—as contraband. After the affair with the telephone inter - views, and my books being found in the prison libraries, they were all jittery about more questions in the Viennese Parliament, I heard later.

The Minister of Justice, Frau Gastinger, would not have approved, though the authorities did impose one final quirky rule on me: I was not permitted to draw any non-fiction books from the library. “Because of your offence,” the governor tartly snapped at me after I protested to the court, even before the trial was held. “— alleged offence,” I corrected him, and asked for the cell door to be closed. I did have some frustrations. A Munich auction house revealed to me that it would be selling Himmler’s \u00189\u00180 pocket diary in October. It is one of the few Himmler diaries not yet found and researched by histo - rians, but the reserve price was \u00185 , 000 euros, and taking copies of it was not permitted. These months did provide an opportunity to ponder some of the deeper Himmler mysteries. My family in London sent me a copy of his wife’s diary, which I had acquired just before my arrest. “Work on Hein - rich Himmler progresses,” I reported to my friends as the summer drew in. I have finished reading the diaries of his wife, and written one hundred and twenty pages of notes based on them.

I had fortunately donated all my earlier Hitler research files to the Institute so they had escaped seizure in London. It struck me that I did not use the word “ Holocaust” once in this interview note, but then I realized why—that word was unknown at the time of my interview; it came into usage only later, in the mid- \u0018970 s. Gebhard told me that “Heini” had not even told him in \u00189\u0018\u0018 about the forthcoming campaign in Russia: “We saw the munitions and troop trains passing eastwards through Dresden every day,” he said, “but we did not know about the attack until the day it happened.” From a lawyer in Chicago I had already obtained and read the two hundred pages of letters that Himmler had written to his mistress be - tween \u0018938 and \u00189\u0018\u0018 .

I rejoiced in that small sunbeam until the patch climbed up the wall facing my cot, and vanished. A Turkish Hausarbeiter furnished the cheering word that in summer the cells here in the Josefstadt jailhouse became baking hot, as the floors were covered in a toxic black paint. Spring would soon be over and already Austria was gripped in an extended heatwave.

At the behest of who knows whom, Austrian officials were gearing up to charge me, “In the Name of the Republic” of course, with committing a new thought-crime. In his gloomy, \u001850 -year-old workshop at the far end of this depressing grey stone building, the “Landl,” in the heart of Vienna, the public prose - cutor Michael Klackl had begun to polish a second, potentially far more deadly case against me, one which threatened a maximum sentence of twenty years and even life imprisonment.

It seemed absurd that in a free world, six decades after the end of World War Two, an interview with a newspaper could lead to new criminal charges. I cannot deny that I was worried, but I kept this unsettling devel - opment from my own family. Our London home was now lost, our surviving possessions all gathering dust in storage; Bente and Jessica had worries of their own. Conscious that every letter that I wrote, however intimate, was still being censored and copied for the prosecutor, I reported to a friend: It looks as though the Viennese criminal authorities are hoping for a second bite at the cherry. The Austrians are now contemplating prose - cuting me again for an article published by the Vienna newspaper Die Presse on March 3 . The prosecutor Dr. Michael Klackl is understood to object to a passage in which I drew attention to the fact that nearly \u001800 , 000 Jewish prisoners survived Auschwitz until the camp was abandoned in January \u00189\u00185 . More irksome for the criminal authorities was the title for the whole-page article: “ austria is acting like a nazi state ”. In the present vindictive mood, if the consequent irony of their new action is lost on the authorities here, I will again be prosecuted. I was summoned at 9 : \u00180 a.m. this morning to be interrogated about the article, and about a dispatch issued by the Austrian Press Agency APA, and no doubt also about the BBC “Today” interview—although the judge did not get that far as I refused to answer any questions at all.

I think highly of Hilberg; in fact he shared many of my views—though I was unlikely to see him here in Josefstadt. (In fact there were only two Jews in this jail, on the floor above ours, C- \u0018 : one was made Blockschreiber , or block-clerk, although the jailers told me he could, or would, write only in Hebrew script; the other was allowed to keep his cell door permanently open on some pretext or other.) On December 5 , \u0018975 , while researching Hitler’s War , I had asked Professor Hilberg, “Is there any acceptable evidence linking Hitler himself with the order to exterminate European Jews?” I added that there was of course enough evidence linking Hitler with the killing of Russian Jews and with the deportation of the European Jews to the East. Professor Hilberg replied that he too now believed there was no such Hitler extermination order: “Possibly, the destruction of the Jews was so drastic that it could only have occurred in an organic, evolutionary process, from vagueness to specificity, and in a very real administrative sense, from the bottom up.” Hilberg had a degree of intellectual honesty not often found in the conformist historians. Here is part of the Standard interview: Standard : Mr. Hilberg, do we know all there is to know now about the Holocaust? Hilberg : As good as twenty percent. . . There just hasn’t been the research, because people did not want to know certain things, for example that the poor died first, and only then the well-to-do. . . Standard : One topic at the Wiesenthal Symposium was Wiesenthal’s memorandum to the Austrian Government forty years ago, stating that Austrians were disproportionately involved in the Holocaust. Hilberg : [ Agrees, with many details ]. Standard: Should we be imprisoning David Irving for Holocaust- denial [ sic ]? Hilberg : To be honest, no. He is a charlatan ( Hochstapler ). Standard : As an historian, yes. But he has provided legitimacy to the deniers. Should Holocaust denial be criminalized at all? Hilberg : Not in my view. I am for freedom even for these people. We can even learn from them. They’re like children who say: Prove it! And so we must—prove it!”"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"9\u0018 Dr. Herbert Schaller, my attorney, had also seen the Hilberg interview. He included it in a fresh submission to the Oberster Gericht shof (OGH), the Viennese Supreme Court. I reminded him that in Canada the Crown had called the unfor - tunate Dr. Hilberg as a well-paid expert witness at the original trial of Ernst Zündel in Toronto, and he had crumpled under defence counsel Douglas Christie’s fierce cross-examination; when the prosecution asked him to testify again at the \u0018988 retrial (at which I was also called, by the defence) Hilberg flatly refused, stating that he never wanted to go through that ordeal again. Hence, I rather suspect, Hilberg’s wan admission that only twenty percent is known; which is not to claim that we non- conformist histo - rians know the other eighty percent. At least he had been honest. Schaller and I, we both chuckled loudly as we shook hands and parted, and a friendly prison officer escorted me back along the stiflingly hot corridor to Cell \u00189 . “Air conditioning’s out in my cell,” I jested. “Whole building,” he grunted, and the bare, wax-polished corridor, lined with its dark green steel doors, rocked with our jovial but incon - gruous laughter. In the afternoon a different prison officer brought me an ominous Notice. The prison had started a formal inquiry into whether I had breached regulations by having a copy of Henri Roques’ dissertation on the “ Kurt Gerstein Report” in my cell.

His name was Andrew von W., he announced, citing the name of one of Austria’s most famous philosophers. He offered congenial, amusing company, and I often shared my morning stroll with him. After a day or two he initiated a subtle campaign whose purpose I never really fathomed. His grandfather von W. had been a famous Luftwaffe ace, he confided, and had left behind two cases filled with uniforms, a Luftwaffe dagger, and three black leather-bound volumes which contained the inventory and location one of the most sought after"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"93 treasures of World War Two, the fabled Bernstein Zimmer, the Amber Room looted by German troops from Leningrad during the war. The loot was concealed, he said, in a former Luftwaffe bunker in what had been the German Democratic Republic, the DDR, near Halle. This was precisely how I had picked up so many precious documents during the years of my research, an unexpected tip-off. To the questions which immediately arose—why me? And why had he not himself profited from this immense wealth?—he had ready answers. So I pricked up my ears; after all I had little else to do; he was good company, as said, and a cut above the rest of those in the prison yard. He seemed to have free access to our jailhouse wing’s pay tel ephone, and the officers allowed him to speak for hours at a time. As for the black leather volumes, he described that these contained in copper - plate Sütterlin handwriting the inventory of each piece of the Bernstein Zimmer —he professed that he himself could not read such Old German handwriting well—and of the bunker room in which it was stored; helpfully, a map of the location was glued into the third volume. The easy telephone access did momentarily puzzle me. I recalled that when I had first arrived, Inspector Böhm, an elderly prison officer about to retire, snarled: “Even though the judge has given his consent, Herr Irving, that doesn’t mean that we here will permit it, not by a long chalk.” From Cell \u00189 of “C” Block I began Operation Leonard, to research the real history of the Bernstein Zimmer —not easy when six weeks elapsed between every letter and reply. I began to check the details through my friends. One Australian historian whom I knew was an expert on the whole Von W. family and their ancestors. Another knew all about the Luftwaffe aces. By the time their replies came in, this Italianate gentleman in the yard had already begun to lose me; he was making the familiar mistake of all tricksters. It reminded me of the saga of one Klaus Benzing, who had offered me the hidden wartime diaries of Hitler’s Intelligence chief Vice-Admiral Wilhelm Canaris back in the \u0018970 s. Von W. embroidered the story with more and more detail, as I mildly asked for further particulars, and eventually he tripped himself up. The map gave the precise geographic coordinates, he said. It was glued in, unusually, with North at the bottom, he recalled. He even sketched what Lifetime Achievement Award"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"banged up 9\u0018 it looked like. He and his brother had visited the location in the closing years of the DDR, he said, using GPS (satellite navigation) to pinpoint the precise location: they had spoken with the farmer on whose land the bunker ruins were—the bunker was still there, partly demolished, and overgrown with weeds. I pointed out in the nicest possible way that the DDR breathed its last gasp in \u0018989 , and that GPS was not publicly available by then. Of course the next day he smoothly and seamlessly enlarged his story to explain that blemish too. I never really fathomed what he was after; true, he got free coffee handouts and other groceries from me in the first weeks of his impris - onment, but I would have given him those even without the tall stories. His face vanished from our wing some weeks later; newspapers reported that the court had sentenced him to seven years as a confidence trickster, having deceived the noble lady whose name he now bore (he had changed it by deed poll). He had also used his charms on Inspector John, one of the senior Block Chiefs, as I learned later from the trusty, Zoran. We were swapping yarns about the trickster, to general laughter in the prison yard. Each had his own story. Learning that the jailer Herr John was a passionate huntsman—a member of what Adolf Hitler referred to scathingly as “ die grüne Freimaurerei ,” the green Masonic lodge—Von W. had mentioned to him that he had had a bit of luck: he had inherited a hunting preserve in the Tyrol, and he hinted that he would be happy to invite the Inspector as his guest when happier times returned. That explained perhaps the liberal use of the telephone that he was allowed. the yard was a kaleidoscope of strange faces at eleven-thirty each morning that summer, as new prisoners arrived, and still more fled outside from the heat of their cells. That same month as I was shuffling anti-clockwise round the crowded yard in the sunshine, and occasionally pausing to read another chapter of a Graham Greene novel in my favorite spot along the sunshine wall, a prisoner came loping across the patch of baked mud and grass in the centre, and rather shyly asked if I was the English writer. I nodded cautiously. “There is somebody over there who’d like to speak with you,” he said, and beckoned over a slim, educated looking"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"95 young man in his thirties hovering in the far corner. His name, he said, was Gitan W.; I won’t write his full name as (if genuine) he is still a prisoner; and it may not even have been his real name, as two searches of the Austrian prison computer database on my behalf by friendly officers failed to raise any trace of him. Prison is full of mysteries. He had been passing through Vienna a few days ago, his pockets full of euros, he described, when police arrested him—and then the whole story came tumbling out. “I am a Sinti, a gypsy,” he said. “We are not like the Romas. They are just lazy layabouts; we are a hard working, educated clan, with careers and professions like teachers and lawyers. The Romas come originally from India,” he continued. “They are crooks, thieves, and cheats, they do nothing but thieve all day, and sing all night.” At the mention of the late-night lullabies I nodded with a weariness born of familiarity, and jerked a thumb up to the cell window next to mine. “We Sintis live on a housing estate, a project, outside Stuttgart,” he continued his tale. “We are awarded 500 euros a month by the German Federal Republic, and we pay no taxes—these concessions are a recog - nition of our suffering as Sintis under the Nazis. My father and grand - father were in Auschwitz,” he explained. As a court- and newspaper-nominated “denier,” I stiffened slightly, still not guessing where his story was heading. Shortly he began to pour out his whole extraordinary case: he had been driving through Vienna to Bulgaria a few days before, carrying a large sum of euros in cash, to buy oil paintings. He was a dealer—“We buy up unwanted family junk, and sell antiques.” (I do not know whether to put quotation marks around that latter word or not.) He had checked into the Intercontinental Hotel and paid cash in advance for the night, but in completing the registration form which the Austrian police still require of their country’s hotel guests, he had entered simply his family name “W.”—omitting the first name, Gitan, short for “ gypsy”. I understood why, I said. They don’t like gypsies in Austria, whether Roma or Sinti in origin. I motioned him to go on, and he did. At two a.m. the police had rousted him out of his room, at the instance of the hotel management, and searched his property.

Before his execution, Gitan’s grandfather had given it to his father; the father let Gitan carry it with him as a memento, which is why the Viennese police had found it, a few days before, in his wallet. I looked at him quizzically, still waiting for an explanation for why he was here in prison. At five a.m. that morning, he continued, he was formally arrested, charged with concealment of a genocide, and brought here to Josefstadt prison. I gasped, but the young man’s story grew even wilder: the investi - gating magistrate had been as perplexed as I was, and had promised a swift hearing in five days’ time, and indicated he would be released. W. had phoned his wife back in Stuttgart with the good news. Instead, he was taken to Stein prison, which I knew from yard talk was one of the nastier prisons in the Austrian system. Here plain-clothes investigators had visited him from, he was told, the Israeli embassy. The lady judge presiding over the subsequent hearing in Vienna would not hear of a swift release. In Austria all prisoners are guilty until they prove their innocence. In Austria moreover all accused must always show remorse. “Do you regret your deed?” she had challenged the prisoner, as is the Austrian custom. Deed? Gitan W. protested that he was innocent—the document was his family property, he had nothing to show regret for. His court- \u0004 Alan H., of Warsaw, an expert on Polish World War Two history, has commented: “The first hangings took place in Auschwitz in July \u00189\u0018\u0018 but of two Catholic Poles for attempted escape.

The judge repeated her question, Gitan W. told me, more sharply: “ Do you regret your deed ?” Gitan could see his lawyer nodding fervently as a signal to him. So he shrugged and agreed that he did feel remorse. “That is just as well,” said the judge, “otherwise the sentence would have been ten years. You will serve two years.” As he was led out in a daze, he stopped and called out to the Judge: “You’ll go home tonight to your own bed, and I won’t see mine, or my wife and kids either, for two years. . .” She ordered him to be silent, and motioned dismissively to the guards. The Viennese prosecutor smirked. “ Auf Wiederseh’n, Zigeuner ! Farewell, Gypsy!” “My name is not Gypsy, it’s Gitan W—,” he retorted, as he was escorted out. “ Z’gainer bleebt Z’gainer ,” sneered the prosecutor, lapsing into the Viennese dialect. Once a gypsy, always a gypsy. I asked if he would appeal, and he bitterly said he would not: he could just about handle the two years, and sentences on appeal were often increased—half a dozen words I did not really want to hear. I wrote a six-page note on what he had told me, and tested him during the exercise period the next day for more details, just as I had the “noble” trickster earlier. His account remained identical, with one piquant added detail: “The Judge was a Jewess,” he recalled, as an afterthought, and he gave me her name. “ Sonja Allyes.” I wanted to ask him the next day for his court file number and his lawyer’s name, but they had already removed him in the Krokodil to Stein.

This time their search of my cell, No. \u00189 , lasted over an hour, and when I was finally escorted back to it, the scene defied all the usual hurricane-aftermath clichés. Every tin and packet had been torn open, papers strewn around, and much of my property had drifted down to the floor (a level I was now finding more difficult to reach, as my muscles lapsed into an ante-mortis rigor). Again the officers left my cell empty-handed, and this time there were no jests or smiles. Two other cells were also searched, but given only the briefest once-over. The next day a trusty told me that the Block Chief, the same Inspector John we have met before, had confided to him that Judge Liebetreu had ordered this special search, as the prison had been informed that Dr. Schaller had smuggled an item of contraband into me at his last visit. The two other cells had been searched as a blind. In fact Schaller was not just korrekt , but over-scrupulous: the Austrian judiciary had disbarred him some years back for five years for his nationalist views, and even now it allowed him to act only as a Strafverteidiger , defence counsel, and not as a Rechtsanwalt , attorney, like the young Dr. Kresbach. I picked up my pen and resumed writing where I had left off, and I wondered who had unjustly fingered Schaller, and why. i had been imprisoned for eight months, locked down alone for twenty- three or twenty-four hours a day.

Correspondents were “embedded”—i.e. in bed with—the IDF [Israeli Defence Forces] forces, but I never saw them step outside that compound of artillery howitzers, whose mission was to create a holocaust among the Lebanese villages, a clear war crime, by the way. The fighting stopped four days ago. We have still not been told how many IDF tanks and armored vehicles were destroyed by rocket- propelled grenades [RPGs]—and those tanks don’t come cheap. Other battlefield incidents just vanished as though they had never happened. Hizbollah claimed to have shot down an aircraft. Israel denied it. I saw with my own eyes on the Turkish news bulletin a large flaming object brought down over Beirut. Israel suggested it was “a container”. Robert Fisk saw the wreckage, mostly unidentifiable but including what looked to him like a helicopter rotor blade. Hizbollah claimed to have attacked a warship. Israel muttered that a “Colombian freighter” had been sunk. Again, nobody followed up. As for the tank casualties, the wrecks were pushed into the famous media Memory Hole, like in that popular TV series where the losing robot warrior is toppled into the pit. Once, an early news bulletin showed telephoto footage of a short column of tanks, and the lead tank receiving an RPG smack in the mouth and blowing up.

The judge there was threatening Dr. Schaller with arrest if he dared submit certain motions to the Court.

London cabbies are always happy to have something they can tell their passengers (one told me the mayor had recently sent a circular letter for - bidding them to call themselves Black-cab drivers—“racism”). I tried the same kind of riddles on the jailers. “What’s twelve times eleven?” I challenged Inspector John one afternoon. For us English, it’s a simple sum: every English infant has learned his eleven- and twelve-times tables, because Old England had twelve inches to the foot, and twelve pence to the shilling. The jailer spluttered, shook out his fingers, and began to work it out. “Hundred and thirty-two,” I prompted, and explained why we Eng - lish knew. “Won the war for us, that did,” I suggested facetiously. “While you Huns were working it out, twelve times eleven, we had the answer already.” He grinned foolishly as he locked me back in. The next morning, at seven a.m. he was still there, this time with the breakfast cart. “Hundred and thirty-two,” he bellowed as he opened the door. He was king of the hill. “I had night shift, Herr Irving, and not one of the others knew the answer.” “Told you,” I said. “Won the war that did.” december \u00180 , \u0018006 , the day of the appeal, was now just one day away. I did not mark it off on the wall; for me one day was the same as the next. What did I expect as the outcome? The brain works at many conflict - ing levels, and mine was no different: on one floor it was realistic, and expected that things would in fact only get worse, as I was in “their” hands now, and they were working to that end. On another floor, my brain was listening to Dr. Schaller who re - mained obstinately up-beat. He had found that the OLG had allotted the appeal hearing only a thirty-minute slot. They’re Out for Blood"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"banged up \u0018\u0018\u0018 “That can mean only one thing, Herr Irving,” he said as he settled himself into his chair on the other side of the glass panel on the day be - fore the hearing: “They are going to order your immediate release.” I groaned silently. Lawyers! “They can’t do otherwise,” he insisted, which made it worse, rath - er than better. Grinning lawyers, I had now seen more than enough of them. I said, “Herr Dr. Schaller, I must be realistic—so I can tell the family in London. Are they to expect me home tomorrow, or will I be here for many more years?” He grinned again, his engaging boyish grin, for all his eighty-three years, and repeated his prognosis. “A short hearing means only one thing— appeal allowed.” “It takes just as long to say No as Yes,” I retorted. He could not be shaken. “If they are going to deny the appeal,” he reasoned, “then I am entitled to call for a full reading of all the papers and my own submission, and that would take far longer than the thirty minutes allotted.” That made more sense. With a spring in my step I went back to Cell \u00189 . Officer Hornicek let me phone Bente in London and I confirmed that the general view was that I would be home the next day. I washed the cell’s walls and floor, and began to go through my papers and package things up—parcelling the manuscripts I had written here in captivity, throwing away dead paper, and tidying things for a quick getaway if the appeal succeeded, yet aware all the time that by doing so I was tempting Providence. later that afternoon Officer Grobmann unlocked the door to escort me to an unscheduled last discussion group before Christmas. The Vien - nese newspapers and radio were bookmarking the coming appeal widely, while making no predictions. The group’s other five participants all knew that the hearing was slated for the next day; there was a tinge of envy about their remarks. Grobmann had brought a case of beer into the room—none of us had seen alcohol since we arrived. He plonked a can of Schwechater lager on the table in front of me, but I pushed it aside. “No offence,” I said, “but a coffee would do me fine.”"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"\u0018\u00183 The others, all meanwhile sentenced to terms of eight and even ten years and waiting with little real hope for their appeals, were eager to deflate me. One well-informed prisoner loudly scoffed that Dr. Schaller was manifestly wrong—there was no way that my appeal would succeed: “From this prison, only three have got away with an appeal to the OLG in the last five years,” he said. As he said the words “got away”, an image of the homemade glider in the loft of the British prisoner-of-war camp in Colditz Castle flickered into my mind’s eye, but it failed to blot out the preceding words “only three”. Be realistic, they all slyly agreed, forget about it; and Grobmann, the plain-clothes police officer, nodded with a friendly, Christmassy, grin. Their vote was unanimous: the appeal had no chance of success. As I padded back to the cell in my sandals, I realised now with dread that I had given Bente and Jessica the wrong information. I had raised false hopes. I cursed Dr. Schaller for his forced and misplaced optimism. december \u00180 , \u0018006 was a Wednesday, and became more immediately memorable for me because it was the first day that I actually saw the Christmas city of Vienna, in whose very heart I had been living for four - teen months. Guards and the sudden ceiling lights awakened me at six a.m. as usu - al. I dressed in my “best” clothes, such as they were. A beetle had made a meal of one blazer sleeve, as I noticed only now. I disconsolately peeled the last photos of my children and grandchil - dren off the wall where they had accumulated over the months, sprawl - ing outwards across the plaster in all four directions like new suburbs of Las Vegas across the Nevada desert. Inspector Bernhard Hornicek noticed their absence at once when he came round unlocking doors for the break - fast cart a few minutes later; I think I saw him shake his head slightly, but he already knew what I was thinking, and made no comment. In my diary I pencilled these lines: In view of last night’s remarks by Officer Grobmann, I now have little hope of the appeal succeeding: only three have succeeded at the OLG in recent years, he said.

I still managed to slip an open fountain pen into my handcuffed hands however, my trademark, I ex - plained to The Walrus: I am a writer. . .

The van delivered me into the closed yard of the building, and after several minutes’ delay while they adjusted the handcuffs and waited for the signal to proceed, like stagehands at the Covent Garden Operahouse, we went up in a roomy metal-walled eleva - tor to the courtroom level. As I stepped out of the elevator, I found that the whole building was filled incongruously with live classical music, inevitably that of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. A string quartet was playing in the enclosed atrium below us. It was almost surreal, as the delicious baroque music floated up to the marble galleries and ceiling, and the squad of grim-faced police encircled me and forced a way through the press. I was conscious that I now looked a real thug with my razored-down hair and puffy, pallid prison skin. In the courtroom itself I saw the now usual (though to an English eye, deeply unfamiliar) crush of press photographers and tele vision cam - eras; flanked only inches away by police officers, I had to stand there and then sit for fifteen minutes while the manacles were unlocked and these jackals clicked and flashed and whirred away at me. The five appeal judges were already in court. Their president Ernst Maurer looked disconcertingly like me, a clas - sical horror-film scenario.

I had not expected her to come from Budapest. She must have been up all night. She had driven over once a month with her fiancé to chat with me for fifteen minutes from behind a soundproof glass window in Josefstadt prison; she had had to set out at three a.m. to get to Vienna in time for each visit if somebody else was not to beat her to it.

Rather alarmingly, the auxiliary judge, a young female, read out the whole of Judge Liebetreu’s fifty-page Judgment of February \u00180 , in a toneless, unaccentuated voice. It took her the best part of an hour. My heart sank. We were already in injury-time. It rather destroyed the basis of Schaller’s confident prognosis. At one point in her toneless recital, where I quoted in my \u0018989 lectures a particularly shocking \u00189\u0018\u0018 Foreign Office admission that they them - selves—British propagandists—had invented the gas-chamber story for war purposes (“That too was a lie,” the official admitted), I interjected: “Quote–unquote”—that was a quotation, namely; it was not I who had said it. I was not comfortable with what I had heard. There were many points I had made quite forcefully in those \u0018989 lectures that I would not make today, and the Liebetreu Judgment had included nothing of the balancing arguments I had made for the other case. Read out in that expressionless legal voice, it sounded very extreme, and it soon got worse, as the State Prosecutor, the chief public prosecu - tor, addressed the court, heatedly and with many gesticulations, for half an hour, demanding a much stiffer penalty than the three years already handed down to me (and no doubt wishing that a death sentence could have been possible). I felt certain now that the sentence would go up, and heard whispers of “ fünf ”— “five years” from behind me, which I thought perhaps even an underestimate. my own friend and attorney Dr. Herbert Schaller, veteran of many a legal battle, fearless and patriotic too, would now perform the final act. Gath - ering his black robe around his shoulders like a schoolmaster, he rose to his feet and orated as though he were addressing a public meeting. It was a treat to hear. Waves of silent applause rolled across the public benches toward him.

Quite so. Even so, I was now without hope. At Judge Maurer’s invitation I ad - dressed the court in German, also without notes though only briefly, for perhaps two minutes or more, anticipating that my voice would not now be heard in public for several years. I pointed out that Judge Peter Liebetreu’s February \u0018006 Judgment, as read out by his female colleague, had of course quoted only the “pros - ecutable” parts of my two \u0018989 lectures in Austria, but that the lectures had been, if taken as a whole, properly balanced pro and con, and that this was why the police officials who actually attended at our invitation each time found (and recorded) that I had not broken the law; that I had now been held for over four hundred days in solitary confinement; that Bente was ill, and that if I were to be imprisoned further I could not be exchanged to a British prison, because the Austrian law, the Banning Law, had no parallel in Britain—one of the prerequisites for such bilateral prisoner exchanges. In other words, I would not see my family for years, if even then. The panel retired to consider. I seized this bleak moment for a final chat with Réka. I said goodbye to my friends in the courtroom too and shook hands all round so far as I could. The police guards made no at - tempt to intervene. the final act.

He handed over one thousand euros, provided by an Austrian supporter, to pay for my one-way flight back to London, and then almost at once he was gone, as this brave and tireless advocate left for the eight-hour journey to Mannheim, where he was still defending Ernst Zündel in that man’s mammoth, year-long trial, almost ignored by the media. I will probably never see him again. The press clung around asking questions that now had an altogether different, more respectful hue. Open season seemed to have ended. At eleven-thirty, the police drove me back across Vienna to the Josef - stadt prison.

Shortly—despite what Dr. Schaller had assured me—I was escorted before the Aliens Police for expulsion proceedings. The clique of “people not like us at all” had evi - dently sprung into action again. Dr. Schaller had already left for Mannheim. I refused to sign any doc - uments. The hours passed, and I was still detained behind locked doors, hanging around in the foyer of our Cell Block. I made a few phone calls, but my phone cards were nearly out of juice. I phoned the Press Association (PA) in London to arrange a big press conference at the Marriott Hotel on Grosvenor Square, next to our old home, at seven p.m. this evening, and I put my brother John in charge. Immediately, it occurred to me that this call to the PA might easily yet become another undoing—I might still be under Judge Liebetreu’s prohibition order and not allowed to call the press. The hours passed. An officer brought me my latest mail, thirty more letters, including one from Bente, one from a lawyer searching for me about a bequest, and one from Rym Belkhodja (a long-lost Tunisian friend from \u001898 \u0018 ). Preoccupied with the inexplicable delay, I put them aside to read on the plane to London. I got through by phone eventually to Bente, and she had disconcert - ing news: the BBC was reporting in London that Judge Liebetreu was livid with the court of appeal for overturning his judgment, and that he was even now casting about for ways to detain me pending the sealing of a fresh indictment for the interviews I had given the BBC and Austrian press in February. I had no way of knowing how true this BBC report was. Inspector Hornicek, our Block Chief, confided to me that there had indeed been an unheard-of development—Judge Liebetreu was refusing to sign my release order pending the arrival of the actual paper warrant from the OLG. It was a very thin pretext. It looked like he was stalling for time. He had been told the decision verbally by the court, by phone, but he was refusing to accept that. Everybody at the OLG had gone home. Three or four hours had passed since the OLG had ordered my release, and I was still very much a prisoner behind locked doors.

With a familiar rattle of heavy keys, he slammed the door behind me as I went in; it looked very bare and inhospitable without my family’s pictures on the wall. I noticed that there was already somebody else’s name on the door. I was no longer in solitary. My cell now also housed a chain-smoking Viennese thug, mentally unbalanced, and evidently deeply unhappy about his incarceration. He looked like another candidate for the rope, like last week’s other two “C”- Block unfortunates. I made diary notes of the day on scraps of paper. This intermezzo ended at \u0018 : 30 p.m. It was already dark. A police es - cort extricated me and drove me across Vienna to the Police Jail. There was no explanation for the move, except perhaps that this building came under a different ministry than the Josefstadt jail.

In this new building I was stripped and searched, and my dwindling possessions were registered once again; it was all the usual chicanery but I was philosophical, resigned, even blasé about it now. One officer asked, “Who was the beautiful young Hungarian in court?”—everybody was commenting on her.

At five p.m. all my possessions were opened and re-boxed. They told me they would bring the rest of the money in my canteen account over from Josefstadt prison tomorrow. That was the least of my concerns. Before they locked me in, at five- thirty I phoned Bente in London, to tell her I would not be home tonight after all, as I was being held in a different Vienna jail and had not been told why. I would now hold the London press conference in two days’ time, on December \u0018\u0018 , as I could not even bank on being back tomorrow. “ It seems like clouds are gathering ,” I said; more than that I decided not to tell her.

I was held in a Vienna police jail. Thursday, December \u0018\u0018 , \u0018006 finally brought this whole unsavoury episode to an end. The tone of the captivity subtly changed—perhaps the officers had been reading reports in the press and were now thinking for themselves. Shortly before dawn the commandant himself, the prison governor, unlocked the door, shifted barely perceptibly to attention on the threshold, and murmured courteously: “Mr. Irving, we are deeply ashamed that this is happening. We do not agree with this at all. We will of course have to treat you the same as any other prisoner. . .” I rewarded him with a strained smile, and said that I expected no different.

With Dr. Schaller himself away in Mannheim, Germany, his daughter Elisabeth, also a fine lawyer, came in to continue the fight. She formally expressed our outrage that the government had broken its undertakings about expulsion. The police responded that I was to be held one or even two more days, pending arrangements. Knowing whom we were really up against, we suspected that there were other reasons for detaining me on Austrian soil. The British press too was expressing puzzlement that I was being detained two more days ostensibly “to speed my departure.” The police offered the excuse that they had no escort officers avail - able today, but Elisabeth Schaller insisted: we needed no escort; I must be permitted to fly out today, since the appeal court had ordered my release; using her cell phone in front of the police officials, she calmly booked me on to an Austrian Airlines flight scheduled to leave for London at 5 : \u00185 They’re Out for Blood"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"banged up \u0018\u00186 p.m. It would cost \u001837 euros, nearly six hundred U.S. dollars (not cheap, but British Airways were asking twice as much).

The attempted police interrogation continued. On Elisabeth Schaller’s cellular phone, still in the police office, I took several incoming calls. The BBC asked if they could come with a TV camera to interview me in this building; the officer pinked and panicked, when I asked him, and said no. I did take a lengthy call from a reporter of Agence France Presse. I fed him some safe morsels—that the prison commandant had privately apol - ogised, and in a very decent way; that I was no Holocaust denier—people who said the opposite had clearly never read my books; and that historian Raul Hilberg had declared that eighty percent of the Holocaust had never been researched, and that some historians should not be imprisoned for thinking differently from others. Asked how I had spent my time, I added that I had spent it “re- calibrating”, resetting all my mental dials to zero; and as a final aside, on an impulse, knowing what journalists need—namely a headline story—I fed him the words: “ Mel Gibson was right.” He knew what I was getting at, but asked me all the same; I declined to amplify. I knew those words alone would do the trick. It was payback time. Still from that police interrogation room, I called John in southwest England again. My brother said that there had been good coverage of yes - terday’s appeal triumph and the lively courtroom scenes were shown on the BBC and other television channels, but that the BBC’s “ Newsnight,” Britain’s most popular late news programme, had cancelled; it looked to me as if the Board of Deputies of British Jews had already put the boot in there, as they had more than once before.

At mid-day four officers traipsed in, with a Gruppeninspekteur at their head, and a young ordinary Inspector, Markus, bringing up the rear; they asked for my autograph. Two women officers shortly followed with the same request, one wanting the signature for her twenty-three year old son. All stayed to chat, and all expressed private outrage at the whole episode and the worldwide harm it was doing to Austria. As they left, they made as if to leave the cell door open as a courtesy; I suggested they close it, to observe the formalities, observing that it was all the same to me. It was now a race between Judge Liebetreu and the State Prosecutor’s office and the police—the former’s efforts to get their second indictment against me drawn up in time to serve it, and the police determination to carry out their duty to remove me safely from Austria. It was not hard to see where the latter’s real sympathies lay. i wondered if “the Jews” of their Kultusgemeinde and elsewhere ever real - ised the lasting harm they did to their own community’s long-term inter - ests by this unbridled persecution fervour against me and other writers; in my case, they had erred, they had stumbled across a famous victim, and one not afraid to hit back.

It’s the end.” One wondered why, I said, and who was behind it. He nodded in silent endorsement. As the afternoon dragged on, I began to wonder if I had been fool - hardy in feeding that Mel Gibson teaser to a press agency while still on Austrian soil."},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"\u0018\u00189 I realised that I had heard the agency man typing my answers straight onto a keyboard, so they would be on the wires by now. If he had embel - lished them in any way, it might well land me back in the goulash. Austria was still a police state. I had been very careful with what I did say and what I did not, but we knew by now what evil-spirited journalists would do to flog their stories. Before I could leave there had to be yet another medical. Blood pres - sure \u001858 , pulse normal, in fact “fit enough for sports” as the woman doc - tor said. Yes, but the muscles, the muscles . . . months of virtual inactivity, and a cot by night that was always four inches too short. Back in the cell, three more hours elapsed and then suddenly it was clear we were winning the grotesque race with the clock. Escorted to a chilly prison van with new officers and two dishevelled Romanian depor - tees, I was at last driven out from underneath the building’s roll-up doors. We hurtled through Vienna’s evening to the airport with police- sirens howling and flashing blue lights, and ran the lights at every intersection as though it were a real emergency. The Romanians tried to make small talk, but I decided to ignore them for these remaining minutes of purgatory. I was still English enough. No more Mr. Nice-Guy; or, as the Americans would say, I was fresh out of niceness now. I dug out of my pocket the letter that arrived from Bente as I left Josefstadt yesterday and read it quietly through. She had had a very hard time, but it was warm and friendly. At the airport, we parked on a police stand, and waited. The officers went away. The minutes turned into hours. We were abandoned. There was some kind of problem now in London. The police officers had all gone inside the warm terminal building and were in no hurry to return. When they returned, I even overheard talk of returning me to the jail - house in Vienna, with all the fresh dangers that that offered. The police van’s engine had long been switched off, and we were held on this outside parking stand for hours on end in the bitter cold; all flights into and out of London were being delayed by the worst fog there for years. The airport there was shut, with scores of planes moaning around in holding patterns over the Home Counties, unable to get in. At last two police officers came to fetch me with the tickets. I learned that my boxes of books and manuscripts had just cost me another four hundred euros—four times what my original return ticket had cost.

If the Austrian taxpayers had been pay - ing for the ticket, and not I, an officer would have been required to ac - company me, handcuffed to me, all the way to Heathrow. Such are the perils of writing real history in Europe today. The handcuffs were removed for the last time. Inside the brightly lit terminal the officers loosened up, I invited them to coffee and bought Austrian newspapers: I was happy to see that the country’s journalists were foaming with obscenities about me. They knew which side their bread was buttered on. What venal cowards they were. The jo urnaille , as Goebbels called them, and by now I knew why. Nothing had changed since then, just the invisible armbands that they wore. i had paid the extra for a business-class seat, thanks to that kind Austrian supporter. I settled down into the Austrian Airlines leather to sleep for the two-hour flight home. I had a lot to think about. I went through my pockets, and found the two exhausted phone cards: I tucked them into the seat pocket in front. Goodbye Austria. After fourteen months without income, damage-repair would oc - cupy me for many months to come: we had lost book sales, publishing contracts, air tickets, lecture engagements, and many of our possessions; Bente had become even more unwell during my imprisonment. Later this night I would find over six thousand e-mails waiting for me to read and answer. In all these months since the moment of my arrest, there had been not one sound, not a peep, from the students who had invited me to speak, the wealthy Vienna student corporation “ Olympia”: no apology, message, letter, or visitor had come from them. I heard months later that Austria’s other student corporations were not forgiving the “ Olympia”, and they were ostracized; they knew now the identity of the traitor who had blabbed to the secret police. My brief inquiries to the “ Olympia” from prison had gone unanswered. I had been left to fend for myself. The Airbus lifted off the Austrian runway two hours late, but we were served a good meal in this class, with real meat for the first time in months and good wine too."},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"\u00183\u0018 in my first week of imprisonment, while still a prisoner in Graz- Jakomini jail, I had once dreamed that I was flying home, and that a flight attendant was bringing me a bottle of champagne with the compliments of British Airways after my ordeal, to the loud applause of all the passengers. This meal was almost as good. I declined the alcohol, of course; I had always steered clear of it. We landed heavily at Heathrow—a totally blind landing in thick fog—around nine-thirty. A jostling, elbowing, politely unruly pack of press and television photographers was thronging the walkway off the plane, rather mystifyingly for the other passengers following behind me. After all, I was no Tom Cruise or Kate Middleton. More newsmen waited outside the Customs area. The BBC could not now use me—I phoned them first—it was too late. Most U.K. national newspapers had already gone to press. Damn the English fog. Channel \u0018 was also lost. Here at Heathrow airport I suddenly felt very tired. I bought a new phone card and some English currency. I stayed for an hour talking to Reuters, and to other reporters in the arrivals area, and to a young lady Associated Press interviewer. In the Americas it was still only afternoon and evening. So there was still a meagre plus side to the profit-and-loss account of all those days in solitary. I had banked on getting at least one broadcaster to offer to drive me into the city. Now, with so much baggage, I would have to take a cab to London, which robbed me of another sixty pounds. “Take me to Sloane Street,” I groaned, and gave the cabbie the street number. It was long after eleven p.m., and an icy, damp, cold, London winter evening. A chilly sleet was washing away the earlier fog as we pulled out of the airport complex, fourteen months after I had parked my car there— long since stolen—for a two-day trip to lecture students in Austria. “Four hundred days in solitary,” said the cockney driver. “Gorblim - ey!” I began to tell him about Rudolf Hess, and Spandau prison in Berlin, and forty-seven years, but decided not to. He deposited me with my suitcase and two boxes outside the apart - ment building’s showcase front door, half-way down Sloane Street. Of course I had not yet seen our new home.

The block had the big art deco frontage of the Thirties, in one of London’s most fashionable streets, and through the glass I could see that the foyer was warm and brightly lit. The concierge’s desk was empty. I thought again of those bikes rust - ing in the warmth of sub-tropical Key West, I straightened my tie, and I rang the bell of our apartment. The snow had now reached London’s West End and it had begun drifting down around me, and I finally noticed how cold it had become. I was in my shirtsleeves and a pullover. It was nearly midnight, and Bente and Jessica had probably given up and gone to bed. A minute or two passed. I rang the bell again. The street was deserted. In the distance I heard a police car’s siren, and saw flashing blue lights coming from Sloane Square. For the briefest instant I stiffened, then relaxed.

This was the Gold bracelet which my sister Carol, wearing her horrid pink coat, pointed out to me, as it lay glittering at the bottom of the pond—the pond in the field just behind our house in Essex, the pond which had once been a bomb crater. I was five years old, and interested in anything that glistered. As I lay there drowning in my navy jersey and short brown overcoat, face down among the water-lilies and sticklebacks, and knowing noth - ing of foreshortening and refraction, I found that I still could not touch that bracelet. Feet came running across the field, and hands fished me out. They were just in time, or were they ? Did all that has passed before my eyes since then ever really hap - pen—the pink elephants at school, the prizes, The Phoenix , the blast of the steel furnaces in the Ruhr, the photos of the Dresden funeral pyres, the Pottersman Factor, the raucous beerhall audiences, my oldest daugh - ter’s coffin and the hate-wreath that followed, the life-size bronze stat - ue of a racehorse, the handcuffs, the Austrian cops with drawn pistols pointed at my head, and all the rest? Or were these just kaleidoscopic images in the blink of an eye, the life I nearly had but never did, flash - ing past in the last mortal second before it was snuffed out and the Lord gathered me up, still only five, into His arms? So many unanswered questions. Did I really make my mother happy in those years of childhood? “ Da-vid .” In my memory I can still hear her voice, crystal clear, calling down the garden from the back door of our house, against the background honking of John’s geese and the bleating of the nanny goat, drifting toward the field, the pond. In the letter which she later left tucked into an escritoire, for us to find after she died, she \u001835"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"banged up \u001836 wrote of all the happiness we four had given her in her lifetime. No child can ask for more than that. I was born the last of four, a non-identical twin in every possible respect. My twin brother, a heavy smoker, balding early and speaking always in almost a whisper, prone as a child to cruel chilblains and other frail - ties ... Nicky always was—and still is—a good sort, but he had the same birthday as I; and if there is one thing about that date, the birth date, it is this: it is ones own very personal possession. For the rest of ones natural life it stands out from all other dates in history. Mining the captured Nazi archives in the bowels of the underground Berlin Document Center administered by the Americans in post-war Berlin, I heard Elke Fröhlich, then a young history postgraduate from Munich working as my assistant, quietly gasp as she stopped turning the pages. In her hand she held a yellowing document for just a few seconds longer than the rest, January 30 , \u00189\u0018\u0018 . I knew at once what that day was for her. A year or two later I was interviewing Rear-Admiral Karl-Jesco von Puttkamer in Munich. He had been Hitler’s naval adjutant, a member of his innermost circle, his military household, from \u0018935 until the very end. Rather strangely, he had never been interrogated after the war. I was the first researcher he spoke to, and I taped all the interviews. He liked to reminisce, and I knew how to listen. “You are so fortunate, Herr Kapitän ,” Hitler had once told him dark - ly, when Puttkamer formally asked him for permission to marry. “I can never get engaged or marry. I am wedded to Germany.” The admiral puffed at his cigar contentedly as he told me this little snatch of conversation. I knew at once that I would be using it in my Hitler biography. “Roughly when was that, Herr Admiral ?” I inquired. “I can tell you exactly. It was the afternoon of March \u0018\u0018 , \u0018938 .” From across the room the admiral’s wife beamed approval. It was the day they became engaged. I gasped, as Elke had. March \u0018\u0018 , \u0018938 —I almost asked him what time of day. “Herr Admiral ,” I said, as though it was a matter of general sig - nificance. “That was the afternoon on which I was born.”"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"\u001837"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"banged up \u001838"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"\u001839 Banning Law \u0018 9 , 3 0 , \u0018 6 , 5 7 , 6 8 – 9 , 7 8 , \u00180 6 , \u00180 9 , \u0018\u0018 8 Section 3 ( g ) of, \u0018 9 , 3 0 , \u0018 6 , 6 9 Section 3 ( h ) of, Section \u0018 9 , \u0018 6 , 6 9 , \u00180 6 , \u00180 9 Barbarossa, Nazi invasion of Soviet Union 8 7 Basle \u0018 \u0018 Bawag Bank 8 0 Belkhodja, Rym \u0018\u0018 \u0018 Belzec: concentration camp 9 \u0018 Benzing, Klaus 9 3 Bergen Belsen: concentration camp 6 8 Berlin Document Center \u00183 6 Berlusconi, Silvio: Italian newspaper tycoon 3 \u0018 Bernhard: Viennese carjacker \u0018 \u0018 , 7 5 , 7 9 , \u0018\u0018 3 Bernstein Zimmer .
