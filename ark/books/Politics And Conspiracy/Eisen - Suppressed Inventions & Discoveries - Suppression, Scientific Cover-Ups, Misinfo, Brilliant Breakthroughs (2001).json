Electronics has made us a global village; the Hubble can enable us to see to the beginning of tim e itself; we can pin- point our location through satellite navigation sys tems and hold encyclo- pedias on a microchip. We can do all these things, and yet something is ra dically wrong, terri- bly wrong. We keep polluting our magnificent home w ith the rancid waste from our chemical and petroleum industries, despoil ing our planet and ourselves for the evanescent glory of the bottom li ne. We imbalance the most delicate of balances to conform with the logic of a system that is, to put it charitably, horribly out of whack. Face it: Our entire global immune system is breakin g down before our very eyes. Cancer, the defining disease of our time , inexorably increases in virulence, claiming millions of people every yea r; our climate is becoming more extreme with each passing season; and we seem to be los- ing the battle with the mighty virus as we breed it into our foodstuffs, our vaccines, and ourselves. Our antibiotics have helpe d to breed new super strains of bacteria that eat antibiotics for breakf ast.

Or is it more mundanely political, that we have been taken over and overtaken by a materialist elite whose int erests have overridden the common good so often as to be mistaken for the way it has to be? Perhaps there is just an unwritten conservatism tha t replenishes a reality construct over and over again until it becomes the paradigm which the culture as a whole accepts automatically, condemnin g alternatives to limbo, sublimely unconscious to the looming iceberg s on the port bow. People seem to know in their bones that that pourin g good money after bad is not the way to save the earth. But through r ewards and punishments from infancy on we are encouraged to kneel at the a lter of denial, to negate our creativity except when that creativity i s enlisted to support the system. We are told that this is all there is, that it was meant to be, and that we can't change anything fundamentally.

Somewhere we know th at within the human spirit is a place of creativity so powerful and so encompassing, that given half a chance we can change this course, change thi s moment and change history. And that is what this book is about. It concerns it self with those inven- tions and ideas that have been developed over the l ast 100 years or so which, given enough encouragement, might well have led to a radically different culture and economics than the one in whi ch we find ourselves today. Good—indeed, great—ideas have arisen and hav e been rejected by a society so mired in the dominant paradigm that it could not bestir itself to support its own survival. Nevertheless, one perseveres in the often vain but necessary hope that success will eventuate. There really isn't any choi ce. The inventions and discoveries described and explored in this book may one day be devel- oped for all to use and share. But in the meantime I believe that the first step may rest with the dissemination of the knowled ge of what was, what might have been, and what may yet be.

He was awarded a patent for his work, and although he kept cer- tain vital secrets out of his patent diagrams, he d id demonstrate his device on numerous public and private occasions. Witnesses from England's Royal Automobile Club announced that the car did indeed r un on water, and was in fact getting one hundred miles per gallon. A group of English investors in the Channel Islands supported Blue. They brought him to the United Kingdom and tested t he device, but then, mysteriously, progress was halted. Blue returned to New Zealand and stopped publicizing his invention. Immediately upon his death in 1991, his daughter and son-in-law cleaned out his laborat ory, and brought what they described as \"junk\" to the garbage dump. Thus, Archie Blue's secrets died with him. In 1996, I was invited to Australia to witness a de monstration of anoth- er mechanism that reputedly allowed a car to run on water. The inventor (who understandably wishes to remain anonymous) had received threats after having conversed with a magazine editor. He w as told never to try to put his invention on the market or to write about i t in a public media. However, no one stopped him from showing several of us how the device worked in a Ford Cortina. Running on gasoline, the old Ford could barely mana ge 4,500 revolu- tions per minute before it screamed in obvious pain and blue smoke bil- lowed out from the exhaust pipe. However, after the water device was connected, the engine went to 10,500 rpm with nothi ng but water vapor coming out of the pipe, and no smoke evident at all . Its acceleration was phenomenal. The engine still screamed, but it was o bviously happier run- ning on water. Unfortunately, the inventor's garage was later raided, and his equipment destroyed, making further development impossible."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"2 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries Archie Blue and the aforementioned Australian inven tor were not alone in developing their water-fueled automobiles. The f irst report of such an event was recorded in Dallas, Texas in 1934. Anothe r version of the same idea turned up in 1936, witnessed by hundreds of sp ectators in England. In the 1950s, Guido Franch astounded automotive eng ineers with a chem- ical that allowed water to be burned in exactly the same manner as gaso- line. The performance of a car running on this fuel was fantastic. But despite the obvious successes of such prototype s, not one of these devices is on the market today. Countless inventors have been not-so-gen- tly persuaded to abandon their projects through int imidation tactics such as sabotage and blackmail. Some have even been coer ced into surrender by death threats. And should any inventor persist i n making his work known, orthodox science can be counted on to interv ene and effectively kill the project with rhetoric. Obtaining greater t han 100-percent efficien- cy is, as any sensible scientist knows, impossible. Orthodox engineers would like to have you believe that these invention s somehow violate the \"immutable\" laws of physics by apparently producing more energy than they are consuming. For the true innovator there is only theory, and so there are no laws that cannot be broken. Everything in Nature is a catalys t for wonder and dis- covery, and the authentic inventor welcomes the nex t moment as an opportunity for creation. Really significant advanc es have always grown out of the revelations of independent thinkers and tinkerers who were not learned enough to know that they were violating the laws or physics or any other branch of science. Or perhaps, in the pur suit to improve man- kind's quality of life, they simply didn't care. In our world of research and scientific advancement , it seems only logical to think that if an invention can further t he cause of progress, it will eventually find its way into the mainstream of society. After all, the wonders of our post-industrial age are numerous and diverse, ranging from television to antibiotics. If a suppression sy ndrome has infiltrated our society, how could these modern-day marvels hav e come into exis- tence? On the surface, this would appear to be a valid arg ument. However, the point weakens under scrutiny. For example, televisi on was suppressed for many years by companies with huge investments in th e film industry, who believed that movies would become obsolete. Thanks to their pressure development was slowed, and more than thirty years passed after its dis- covery before television actually made it to the co mmerical mainstream— even though it was backed by large corporations lik e RCA. Antibiotics were released for use on World War II b attlefields only because the United States government made a deal wi th the pharmaceuti-"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Introduction 3 cal companies, granting them patent rights for some thing they had never even developed. This came after several years of ne gotiations, at the cost of thousands of lives. For every once-revolutionary idea that is now commo nplace in our daily lives, many more have been suppressed or with eld by those vested interests with a focus on profit or power. Pure sel f-interest results in strong opposition from multinational corporations, orthodox science, and even our own governments when innovation threatens the status quo. Wealthy and powerful individuals are not inclined t o forfeit their fortunes or their authority, even though the human populatio n as a whole would benefit greatly from new technologies. The suppression of innovation and discovery is an o verwhelming and frightening problem. I have put this book together in order to directly address this critical issue, which I believe deserv es our utmost attention. These collected articles, some of which may surpris e or even shock you, are highly varied, but each and every one is vital to our understanding of the nature of suppression—where it begins, who it a ffects, and how it is perpetuated. Because the suppression syndrome is so far-reaching, I have grouped the material into four sections, each detai ling the struggle of spe- cific ascendancies to maintain their funds and thei r jurisdiction. Section I focuses on the suppression of alternative medicine. Powerful pharmaceutical companies and their agents, the orth odox medical soci- eties, are not ready to lose millions of dollars by admitting that there are nontoxic, inexpensive treatments that are effective in the fight against dis- eases such as cancer and AIDS. Therefore, patients suffering from these and other degenerative illnesses are denied access to possible cures. Many remain unaware that these therapies even exist unti l there is little, if any, hope for recovery. The efforts of organized science to suppress the in dependent researcher are detailed in Section II. Establishment science h as yet to examine itself according to the stringent guidelines of its own Sc ientific Method, the doctrine by which all research and discovery is mea sured. It seems that if scientists assessed their work objectively, they wo uld find that there is no monopoly on truth, a realization which could underm ine their elevated status. What a sad commentary on a branch of knowle dge whose con- stituents should humbly admit that they do not know all the answers—or even all the questions. How can any \"radical\" ideas find acceptance in a system whose aim is self-perpetuation, rather than the betterment of humanity? In Section III you will discover that the public at large remains shock- ingly ignorant as to the extent of our government's involvement with UFOs and extraterrestrials. What if our highest pow ers are in fact sub-"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"4 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries servient to higher powers? It is clear that the cen sorship of sensitive infor- mation regarding extraterrestrial life has been car efully orchestrated so as not to upset the power of our dominant social, reli gious, and political institutions. Finally, Section IV will introduce you to some of t he alternate energy resources that could potentially eliminate our depe ndence on fossil fuels, and curtail research into the deadly menace of nucl ear power. We are not driving around in cars fueled by water, or tapping into the free energy in our atmosphere to light our homes, not because thes e things are impossi- ble, but because power and petroleum monopolies wou ld crumble if our world ran on the abundant, clean, and safe energy t hat some inventors were harnessing decades ago. It is therefore \"in th e best interest\" of these monopolies to maintain a system that is destroying our environment and threatening our very lives. The true nature of suppression is the willingness o n the part of every- one with a stake in the system to uphold the power of that system. To ask if there is more out there than meets the eye is to question our very reali- ty, and to ultimately upset the status quo. We don' t really know our real power—the power of one ethical and courageous act, of speaking the truth. Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries is my attempt to em- power concerned individuals, and to enlighten those who are unaware that there is need for concern."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Section I The Suppression of Alternative Medical Therapies Ralph Moss is, perhaps, the best medical journalist in the United States today. His book The Cancer Industry uncovered the c orruption of the second most profitable business in the twentieth century—c ancer. His latest book, Questioning Chemotherapy, is also a gem. Moss is ve ry persuasive, although it may not take a genius to realize that if powerfu l drug magnates are sitting on the board of directors of Memorial Sloan-Ketteri ng Cancer Center in New York City, and other major cancer hospitals and res earch centers, it will be difficult, if not impossible, to get any favorable results for non-pharmaceuti- cal therapies. In an interview with Gary Null (WBAI radio in New Y ork City), Moss elaborated on this idea: What my research has shown is that many of the top directors (what they call \"overseers\") at Memorial Sloan-Kettering are a lso top directors at drug companies. For instance, Richard Furlow, who i s the President of Bristol-Myers Squibb and Director of the Pharmaceut ical Manufacturers' Association, is a top official of Memorial Sloan-Ke ttering. Richard Gelb, who is the Chairman of the Board of Bristol-Myers S quibb, is a Vice Chairman of Memorial Sloan-Kettering. James D. Robi nson, a Director of Bristol-Myers Squibb, is another Vice President of Memorial Sloan- Kettering. The President of Memorial Sloan-Ketterin g Cancer Center, Paul Marx, is a Director of Pfizer [pharmaceuticals ]. And others [officials of Memorial Sloan-Kettering] are Directors of Bio-T echnology General, Life Technologies, Merck, and so forth. And so what happens, in effect, is that you have a . . . closed circle of people who are, on the one hand, directors of th e world's largest can- cer center; on the other hand, they are either offi cers or directors of the very companies that are producing the drugs which a re used and advo- cated by these centers. . . . There are many, many ways that the drug industry influences the direction of cancer researc h, and of AIDS research. You have to look at it from an economic p oint of view . . . 5"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"6 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries Moss points out that nutritional therapies—impossib le to patent—and therapies like ozone and vitamin C and many others, have been either sup- pressed or ignored by the cancer establishment, by people looking at the issue, as he says, \"from an economic point of view. \" The only treatments chosen are the ones that, strangely enough, turn ou t to be toxic—because these are the only ones that can be patented. And patenting new drugs is extremely expensive. So if you were the head of a pharmaceutical company spending millions of dollars on a new drug that could earn hundreds of millions of dollar s in profits, would you want people relying on herbs and vitamins to treat their illnesses? Would you want a regulatory agency like the FDA to be an advocate for safe, nontoxic treatments, rather than chemical therapies ? Interesting alternatives like Hoxsey's herbal treat ments, and Royal Raymond Rife's frequency machine, that reputedly sc ored a 100-percent cure rate on terminal cancer patients, are not avai lable options for patients searching for cures less harmful than the disease i tself. And you might be surprised to learn that people living with HIV may not have to inundate their systems with drug cocktails, but could instea d benefit from the restorative powers of oxygen in its purest form. Ye t because giant, far- reaching drug companies stand to lose so much, most patients are not made aware of the many alternative treatments that have been developed. To this day workable, testable alternatives to corp orate medicine are not recognized by a system that is geared to maximize t he profits of a phar- maceutical/medical establishment. Censorship extends to information regarding the ver y nature of deadly viruses and crippling degenerative diseases. Mercur y from dental fillings, for example, is actually toxic, and is thought to b e the cause of some neu- rological disorders. And although we are confronted daily by the media with news about HIV, or even if we know someone who is living with AIDS, we probably don't know as much as we think ab out its origin. It's clear that what we don't know can hurt us. This is what happens when profits are prioritized over our health and our ver y lives. This section contains descriptions of several revol utionary therapies for dis- eases that were formerly accepted as \"untreatable\" or \"fatal.\" While the treat- ments described in this book have been shown to be effective for many peo- ple, they may not represent the best treatment for all cancers, immunodefi- ciency diseases, or other degenerative illnesses. C hoosing a therapy for any life-threatening disease is a serious matter. You s hould read widely and dis- cuss your options with a health professional in ord er to make an informed decision about which therapy or therapies you will use."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Does Medicine Have a Bad Attitude? James P. Carter \"... And besides, looking through those spectacles gives me a headache.\" Professor Cesare Cremonini in 1610, explaining why he would not look through Galileo's telescope at the moons of Jupiter. ARROGANT IGNORANCE The sort of excuse above has delayed medical discov eries for decades, even half-centuries. Canadian nutritionist Dr. Davi d Rowland describes this repression of medical innovation as a bad atti tude which he termed \"arrogant ignorance.\" This negative attitude toward many great discover- ies represents a tremendous ego threat. Today such negativity is com- pounded with the industrialization of medicine, whi ch has brought on that \"greed is good (for me)\" philosophy expressed in th e recent movie Wall Street. Segments of the medical profession take wha t they want when they can get it. Arrogant ignorance has followed science and medicin e throughout his- tory. Beginning with the learned colleagues of Gali leo who refused to even look through the glass of his new invention, t he telescope, because they believed they already knew all about the laws of physics, that not- invented-here attitude is alive and well at the daw n of the twenty-first century. Is it only a coincidence that \"not invente d here\" shares initials with our government's National Institutes of Health ? Past suppressions—at least those safely back in pas t centuries—are read- ily admitted by contemporary medicine.

Upon his return to France, Cartier excitedly shared his disc overy with French doc-"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"8 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries tors, who turned a cold shoulder—such a primitive t herapy was witch- craft. If we pass this off as Eurocentrism, we miss the similarities to pre- sent-day rejections of alternative healing methods that are getting the cold shoulder. The case of Dr. Charles Peres, M.D., of F t. Meyers, Florida, pro- vides an excellent example. Dr. Peres was diagnosed with a stage D2 prostate ca ncer spread throughout his body. In lay terms, you can't have a gloomier prognosis. After he adopted a natural regimen based on a low-f at vegetarian macro- biotic diet, his cancer went into complete remissio n. Naturally overjoyed, upon his return to functional living he noticed tha t many of his medical colleagues actually appeared angry that he had surv ived. Would they rather he die than heal himself with this unorthodo x treatment? This very same disdain has been noted by cancer patients who have sought out alter- native cancer doctors and have gone into permanent remission, only to be told by their first doctor that they never had canc er to begin with (despite the complete diagnostic work-up that he had witness ed). Negative reac- tions range from obvious anger to feigned indiffere nce. It must also be told that there are doctors who secretly recommend alternative treatments but warn their patients to never tell the wrong par ty lest the doctor get in trouble. In 1747, James Lind, a surgeon's mate in the Britis h Navy, conducted dietary experiments on board ship. He concluded tha t citrus fruits pre- vented and cured the killer disease scurvy which ra vaged sailors. Captain Cook was one of the first ship commanders to supple ment his sailors with rations of lime. The captain sailed throughout the world for over three years without a single death from scurvy—unpreceden ted for that time. But it took forty-eight years before the British Ad miralty made it offi- cial policy to distribute one ounce of lime juice d aily for each sailor. This simple nutritional supplement of vitamin C was a fa ctor in Britain's ascent to being the world's greatest sea power. It was as though they doubled their forces. Britain sailed farther than any other navy into uncharted ter- ritory, easily defeating weakened enemies who had l ost many sailors to scurvy. Now, neither the British nor the American Indian pe rformed any dou- ble-blind, cross-over studies to arrive at their di scovery. In their respective ways, they learned that it worked very well for the ir needs. James Lind had conducted empirical studies (based on observati on) to determine that a citrus fruit could save naval forces from certain death. Ridiculed by their rivals for this use of lime juice, the British were derisively referred to as \"limeys.\" Had they never conducted their simple exp eriment, or had another sea power done so, world history could have been altered. Dr. Jenner, a British doctor, discovered in the ear ly 1800s that milkmaids"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Alternative Medical Therapies 9 who had previously contracted cowpox were protected against smallpox. Jenner scientifically developed a vaccine from the crusty lesions of small- pox patients to inoculate others against smallpox. It took more than fifty years for the medical power structure to endorse hi s simple remedy for a killer disease. In 1848, Dr. Semmelweis, a graduate of the prestigi ous University of Vienna Medical School, introduced a revolutionary i dea while assisting in the Vienna Obstetrical Clinic: he required medical students to wash their hands in chlorine water before entering the clinic. There was an immedi- ate and dramatic decrease in the high death rate fr om puerperal (child- birth) fever. The good doctor became an outspoken a dvocate, pleading with obstetricians to tend maternity patients only after proper hand wash- ing. After a vicious attack on his personal and pro fessional integrity, he was fired from the hospital where he had just eradi cated a cause of death. This courageous, principled doctor then spent ten y ears gathering evi- dence to prove that hand washing would prevent terr ible misery and death from childbirth fever. He published his research in 1861 and distributed the medical text to the major medical societies thr oughout Europe. It was completely ignored. In one of those years, 40 perce nt of the maternity patients in Stockholm, Sweden, contracted the fever ; 16 percent of those new mothers died. The deadly fever continued to ravage women while th e hand washing prevention/cure was \"put on hold\" by Organized Medi cine. The poor doc- tor could no longer cope with the preventable death and misery of so many women. In 1865 he died after a mental breakdow n; such tragedies still occur among gifted researchers whose great di scoveries are ignored. So, from the safety of the next century, Dr. Semmel weis can be credited by the medical profession with his lifesaving disco very—hand washing. In 1867, Dr. Joseph Lister introduced sanitation in surgery, but not without a big fight with the leading surgeons of ni neteenth-century England. His paper, \"On the Antiseptic Principle in the Practice of Surgery,\" was read before the British Medical Assoc iation in Dublin, Ireland. His noteworthy summary concluded: Since the antiseptic treatment has been brought int o full operation, my wards though in other respects under precisely the same circumstance as before, have completely changed their character, so that during the last 9 months not a single instance of pyemia,* hos pital gangrene or erysipelas** has occurred in them. *Blood poisoning c a u s e d by pyogenic microorganisms (pus). ** A disease of the skin and underlying tissue caus ed by hemolytic streptococcus, a bacte- ria that destroys red blood cells."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"10 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries Dr. Lister's contribution outraged the leading surg eons of the day. An 1869 conference of the BMA devoted the surgery addr ess to a scath- ing attack on the antiseptic theory. What presumptu ous London surgeon would believe a lowly provincial from Scotland who was telling them how to improve surgical protocol? As evidence of similar incredible intolerance in th e United States, U.S. Senator Paul Douglas related the following story, w hich was recorded in the Congressional Record in 1963: I spent a part of 1923 with Dr. W. W. Keen. In the Civil War he was a surgeon and had seen many men die from the suppurat ion of wounds after he had operated. He went to Scotland and studied under Lister. Dr. K een came back from Scotland. He was referred to as a crazy Lister ite. He was denied an opportunity to practice in every hospital in Phi ladelphia. Finally there was one open-minded surgeon in the gr eat Penn- sylvania General Hospital. He said, \"Let us give th is young fellow a chance!\" So they let him operate. No one died from infection under Keen. Keen began t o chronicle the results in statistical articles. He was threatened with expulsion from the Pennsylvania Medical Society. This was in the 1890s. Finally he was accepted as t he greatest sur- geon in the United States. Next came Dr. Louis Pasteur, a chemist. His germ th eory for infectious diseases provoked violent opposition from the medic al community of the late 1800s. How could a mere chemist poach upon the ir scientific turf? Dr. Harvey's monumental work on the theory of blood circulation was forbidden to be taught at the University of Paris M edical School twen- ty-one years after Harvey published his findings. A nd it doesn't end there. Austrian botanist Gregory Mendel's theory of geneti c composition was generally ignored for thirty-five years. His pionee ring work was dismissed as that of an idle, rich dilettante by the leading scientists of his day. Dr. Fleming's mid-twentieth-century discovery of th e antibiotic peni- cillin was ridiculed and ignored for twelve years b efore this life-saver was admitted into the medical circle. Once scorned, Dr. Fleming was eventu- ally knighted and received the Nobel Prize in Medic ine for what had once been denounced. As a final example, Dr. Joseph Goldberger unraveled the mystery of pellagra, a disease which ravaged especially the po or in the American South.

Those people dependent on corn-based food s such as grits, corn bread, etc., became deficient in vitamins and miner als. Goldberger's recommendation—to re-fortify corn flour—is now a ro utine practice in refining most flours. But the foot-dragging over th is minor business expense by the greedy flour barons of the time dragged on f or fifty years. These examples are just a handful of so very many c ourageous doctors and scientists who braved a battle with Organized M edicine on behalf of what could help patients. They have the honor and d istinction of repre- senting \"The Enemy of the People\" that was portraye d in Ibsen's drama of that name. The role of deficiency in causing disease is carrie d a step further by Dr. Max Gerson in his text for doctors, A Cancer Therap y—The Results of Fifty Cases. He exposes the depletion of farm soil from chemical fertil- ization as early as the 1930s and concludes that th e depletion subsequent- ly affects nutritional levels in the plants growing in depleted soil. IT'S THE SAME IN SCIENCE Throughout the course of Western Civilization, ther e has been a strong resistance to new information in the other scientif ic fields. There is so much evidence of this bigotry that only a few brief exam ples are offered here. Thomas Kuhn's book The Structure of Scientific Revo lution (2nd Edition, University of Chicago Press, 1970) relates the typically bitter con- flict between an independent science researcher who discovers something important and the current power structure which fig hts to maintain the status quo. German biologist Hans Zimmer wrote, \"Academies and learned soci- eties are slow to react to new ideas, this is in th e nature of things . . . The dignitaries who hold high honors for past accomplis hments do not like to see the current of progress rush too rapidly out of their reach!\" In his 1966 book, DeGrazia recounted the mistreatme nt of scientist Immanuel Velikovsky for his theories in astronomy. Velikovsky had pro- posed that the catastrophic events recorded in the Old Testament and in Hindu Vedas and Roman and Greek mythology were due to the earth repeatedly passing through the tail of a comet duri ng the fifteenth to sev- enteenth centuries, B.C. DeGrazia wrote, What must be called the scientific establishment ro se in arms, not only against the new Velikovsky theories but against the man himself. Efforts were made to block dissemination of Dr. Velikovsky' s ideas, and even to punish supporters of his investigations. Universiti es, scientific societies, publishing houses, and the popular press were appro ached and threat- ened; social pressures and professional sanctions w ere invoked to con-"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"12 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries trol public opinion. The issues are clear: Who determines scientific tru th? Who are its high priests, and what is their warrant? How do they est ablish their canons? What effect do they have on the freedom of inquiry and on public interest? In the end, some judgment must be passed upon the b ehavior of the sci- entific world, and if adverse, some remedies must b e proposed. Philosopher and professor of physical chemistry Mic hael Polanyi com- mented in 1969, referring to the persecution of Vel ikovsky, that new ideas in science are not accepted in a rational manner, b ased on factual evi- dence, but instead are determined by random chance, the ruling econom- ic/political powers, or the ruling ideology. A recent paper by sociologist Marcell Truzzi, \"On t he Reception of Unscientific Claims,\" delivered at the annual Ameri can Academy for the Advancement of Science, proposed that it is even ha rder today for new discoveries and ideas to break through, due to the escalating economics of research. Truzzi wrote, \"Unconventional ideas in sc ience are seldom pos- itively greeted by those benefitting from conformit y.\" Truzzi predicted that new forms of vested interest will emerge from today's programs that must compete for massive funding. He warned, \"This has become a grow- ing and recognized problem in some areas of modern science.\" There is another reason for resistance to scientifi c discoveries. Many of the major advances have come either from a scientis t in another scientif- ic discipline or from researchers who just don't qu alify for membership in the scientific elite (as in high school \"in crowds\" ). No wonder advances so often come not from the \"in crowd\" who are blind ed or corrupted by prevailing dogma. ORGANIZED MED IGNORES SUCCESS Currently there exists impressive statistical and c linical (case study) data on alternative approaches to reversing or controlli ng some cancers with- out the use of chemotherapy, radiation and surgery. But covert politicking and overly rigid systems of testing and approval su ppress these biological approaches that Americans are increasingly accessin g. Desperate cancer patients rarely learn about all their medical optio ns; in fact, a full 80 per- cent of those who travel outside the U.S. for alter native cancer therapies are so terribly advanced in their diseases that it is too late, even for alter- native approaches. This fact alone obscures the val ue of these therapies when they are promptly applied under competent medi cal supervision and not tried as a last resort, following, for example, chemotherapy. Chemo- therapy alone can destroy a patient's immune system , and biological methods usually require a functioning immune system ."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Alternative Medical Therapies 13 Sadly, in this supposed age of enlightenment, the r idicule of the med- ical orthodoxy and a rigid system of testing and ap proval (calcified by the same suspicions of alternative therapies that plagu ed discoveries for cen- turies) keeps these treatments from ill patients wh o might benefit from them, as De Felice, Director of the Foundation for Innovation in Medi- cine, in 1987, lamented: One of the tragedies of our times is that over the past 20 years, a per- vasive and aggressive regulating system has evolved that has effec- tively blocked the caring clinical innovator at nea rly every step. Let there be no doubt that we have quietly, but effectively, eliminated the Louis Pasteurs of our great country. DR. HORROBIN'S CALL FOR AN END TO THE SUPPRESSION OF INNOVATION The Journal of the American Medical Association (JA MA) in March, 1990, published selections from the first Internati onal Congress on Peer Review in Biomedical Publications. Dr. David Horrob in presented \"The Philosophical Basis of Peer Review and The Suppress ion of Innovation,\" a classic presentation. Dr. Horrobin stressed that the ultimate aim of peer review in biomedical science cannot differ from the ultimate aim of medicine—\"to cure sometimes, to relieve often, to c omfort always.\" (Believed to be a French folk saying of medieval or igin, this beautifully simplistic description of medicine's intent is insc ribed on the statue of Edward Trudeau at Saranac Lake, New York.) Dr. Horrobin stated that the purpose of peer review should be nothing less than to facilitate the introduction of improve ments in curing, reliev- ing and comforting. Even in the fields of biomedica l research that are remote from clinical practice, the peer reviewer sh ould always ask whether the proposed innovation could realistically lead to improvements in the treatment of patients. He notes the necessity for a creative tension betwe en innovation on the one hand and quality control on the other. The inno vators who generate the future are often impatient with the precision a nd systematic approach of the quality controllers. On the other hand, the quality controllers are often exasperated by the seeming lack of discipline and predictability of the innovators. If either side dominates, research progress falters. The public is the ultimate source of money for medi cal research. They agree to this use of their money for the sole purpo se of improving their medical care. When improvement does not progress sa tisfactorily, support for medical research (and medical journals) will dw indle. The public wants satisfactory progress; if such progress is no t forthcoming, the pre-"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"14 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries sent medical research enterprise will crumble. For satisfactory results, quality control must comprise only one side of the editorial equation. There must also be an encouragement of innovation. Presently, quality control is overwhelmingly dominant, and encourageme nt of innovation receives very little attention. Without appropriate balance, peer review fails its purpose. Dr. Horrobin notes that, in the last six decades, t he accuracy of medical articles has improved substantially but so has a fa ilure to acknowledge innovation. Between 1930 and 1960, patient care imp roved dramatically. Many infectious diseases were controlled by drugs a nd immunization. Prototypes of drugs used today were discovered duri ng that time. How- ever, by 1960 (despite major developments, especial ly in the field of diag- nosis), patients increasingly felt dissatisfied, an d we must accept the fact that their dissatisfaction stems from our trading i nnovation for quality control. Dr. Horrobin presents many situations in which, thr ough peer review, Organized Medicine has tried to suppress an innovat ive concept but failed. He shows how the use of peer review influences jour nals, conference choic- es and grant awards. Pathologist Charles Harris has written editorials a bout the \"Cult of Medical Science\" in which he says pseudo-science in medicine is cur- rently a cult which inhibits innovation and conside rs participation in clin- ical drug trials (which have been designed by stati sticians) as the work of scientists because these trials reject so-called an ecdotal evidence based on clinical observations alone. But this narrow attitu de is not real science which leads to discovery. It is merely indoctrinati on and a pledge of alle- giance to the flag of pseudoscience. Harris also asserts that diagnosis, which is suppos ed to be the determi- nation of the nature of disease either by examinati on or by exclusion, is not being practiced as it should be. Diagnosis toda y too often does not consist of examination, exclusion, clinical or ther apeutic trials; rather, it often consists only of a rushed referral to a medic al specialist under the guise of a diagnosis. The specialist may accept and act on the initial diag- nosis which was not valid in the first place. The i nitial diagnosis serves to justify referral and satisfy the CPT code in order for the doctor to get reim- bursed. The New York Times, on March 26, 1991, carried an a rticle by Philip J. Hilts entitled \"How Investigation of Lab Fraud Grew Into a Cause Celebre\" recounting how scientists turned a tangled dispute into a defense of science. This article is about a draft report wh ich had been recently released by the newly-established Office of Scienti fic Integrity at the National Institute of Health. This office had been investigating the case of"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Alternative Medical Therapies 15 Dr. Thereza Imanishi-Kari and a paper she published with Dr. David Baltimore in the April, 1986, issue of the scientif ic journal Cell about the basis of an immune reaction. Questions about the pa per arose when Dr. Margot O'Toole, a post-doctoral fellow in Dr. Imani shi-Kari's laboratory, went to Dr. Baltimore (who was then at the Massachu setts Institute of Technology) and told him her reasons for doubting t he authenticity of the data in the article. She alleged that the paper mad e false statements, a con- clusion she reached after seeing seventeen pages of data that supposedly, but did not, support claims in the paper. She persi sted in her accusations, and, as a result, two scientific reviews of the pap er were conducted in 1986—one at MIT, where the work was done, and the o ther at Tufts University, where Imanishi-Kari was seeking employm ent. Both of these reviews found problems with the work but found no r eason to believe mis- conduct was involved. Dr. O'Toole, who was eventual ly fired from her job at MIT, had been told by Dr. Baltimore that she cou ld publish her objec- tions to the paper, but that if she did he would al so publish his views of it. The matter lay dormant for two years after the init ial scientific reviews conducted at MIT and Tufts, until Representative Jo hn D. Dingell, who heads the House Subcommittee on Oversight and Inves tigations, asked the Secret Service to examine Dr. Imanishi-Kari's n otebooks for their authenticity. This action raised the hackles of the scientific community. Supporters of Dr. Baltimore criticized Dingell for prying into the note- books of science and, described his panel as the \"s cience police.\" Dingell revealed that his committee was soon buried in lett ers from scientists con- cerned with the subcommittee's actions, but he also said that in perhaps 50 percent or more of the letters the scientists in cluded disclaimers, say- ing that they did not know the facts of the case. W hat had begun as a small dispute within Dr. Imanishi-Kari's laboratory had b ecome a national debate, pitting Dr. Baltimore and his many supporte rs in the scientific community against Dingell's House Subcommittee and generating bitter controversy over a period of five years. The controversy was eventually addressed by the Nat ional Institute of Health's Office of Scientific Integrity and put to rest by its draft report. In that report, the OSI concluded that Dr. O'Toole's a ctions were heroic and that Dr. Baltimore's response was troubling because he, instead of ending the matter within weeks of its beginning, allowed i t to mushroom into a national debate. Dr. O'Toole's allegations were vin dicated, and most of Dr. Baltimore's supporters have withdrawn their obj ections to the Congressional action after confronting the evidence uncovered by the OSI and presented in their draft report. This case of scientific fraud illustrates the need for an office such as the Office of Scientific Integrity. Dr. David Goodstein , Vice-Provost of the"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"16 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries California Institute of Technology, helped to write the rules for dealing with misconduct. He stated in regard to the Imanish i-Kari/Baltimore case, \"The scientific community until recently was dispos ed to believe that fraud didn't exist. So, in the rare cases that it d id come up, the communi- ty was not prepared for it.\" Having established that fraud can exist in the scie ntific community and having acknowledged the need for an agency to inves tigate such fraud, we now need to address a disturbing question: What abo ut fraud and deceit that is conducted by individuals who work for organ izations such as the AMA and the FDA? Why doesn't the Office of Scientif ic Investigation inquire about what happened with the Koch reagents and how an injunc- tion was issued by the FDA prohibiting interstate s hipment and the mak- ing of any medical claims, without the FDA even inv estigating them? What about the recall by the FDA of all contaminate d tryptophan products sold in health food stores while allowing the conti nued use of the conta- minated product in infant formulas and in intraveno us pharmaceutical preparations? The statute of limitations has expired in the case of the Koch reagents, but it is arguable that there should be no statute of limitations in science, particularly regarding a therapeutically useful dru g. In any case, the statute of limitations has not expired in the recen t contaminated trypto- phan case. Why is this case not investigated by the OSI? If their mandate is not to investigate cases like this, then what is it? Surely their mandate goes beyond an occasional nabbing of a cheating res earcher. It appears that the Office of Scientific Integrity is prepared to investigate individual instances of fraud but not collusion and conspiracy within the ranks of the government itself. The story of vitamin C and cancer was thoroughly re searched by Dr. Evelleen Richards and published in \"Social Studies of Science\" in 1988. Her paper received much publicity. Dr. Richards doc umented in great detail the failure of two Mayo Clinic studies to test vita min C in the correct man- ner proposed by Nobel winner Linus Pauling and his associate E. Cameron. Richards noted the repeated refusal of the New Engl and Journal of Medicine to publish letters and articles by Pauling and Cameron that demonstrated why the second Mayo trial was not a te st of their hypothe- ses. Cameron showed that highly toxic treatments fo r cancer, including 5- fluorouracil for colon cancer, continued to be used despite their failure to demonstrate efficacy in placebo-controlled trials. Richards proposed a valid question: Why does the full weight of disappr oval fall on vitamin C (which has low toxicity), when toxic drugs with no demonstrated efficacy are widely used? Dr. Horrobin contends that the peer review process harbors antagonism"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Alternative Medical Therapies 17 toward innovation. While this is not the norm, it c ertainly is not the excep- tion. Editors must encourage innovation as much as they ensure quality control, and that will require a conscious effort o f will. He points out that the hypercritical reviews and behaviors of many dis tinguished scientists are unwarranted and pathological. Such professional s are gate-keepers against innovation unless the new thought or discov ery is their own. Dr. Horrobin concludes with a call for editors to m uster the courage to select reviewers of the highest caliber without ves ted interest, or at least to note when vested interest is present. Editors mu st stop rejecting innov- ative articles for minor details which never keep e stablishment-approved articles out of the journals. An editor must never lose sight of the ultimate aim of biomedical science—to improve the quality of patient care. Only after scrupulous study of both the article's conten ts and the peer review should the editor make an objective decision. WE MUST STOP PERSECUTING ALTERNATIVE PRACTITIONERS To refuse to learn from history is to repeat it. Th e medical profession con- tinues to libel and slander innovative doctors. The term \"quack\" has no legal definition. It is often misused to libel a do ctor who is bright, full of initiative and well-loved by patients, and who has made an original dis- covery or happened to acquire the non-toxic methods that in the U.S. are referred to as alternative. Real charlatans should certainly be stopped. But should there be these programs aimed at American do ctors such as the chelation doctors or those who employ alternative m ethods for treating cancerous tumors or other chronic diseases such as arthritis, multiple scle- rosis, etc.? This moral injustice should be halted. The involved branches of busi- ness, government and medical profession will in the near future have to answer the well-documented evidence spanning the tw entieth century, that, hidden from the trusting public, a horrible o rchestration of doctor- bashing has occurred to destroy the competition. And what does Organized Medicine say for itself? Wh y, they believe in an overly-rigid definition of what constitutes s cientific proof. The Canadian agriculturalist who developed the double-b lind study never intended for it to be used in such a rigid manner. It was intended to elimi- nate the subjective bias of scientific investigator s and their research assis- tants, not to become the gold-standard bearer for s cientific proof in clini- cal medicine. Most genuine scientists (the term exc ludes the majority of the medical profession) do realize this fact. Real scientists understand that a)) science starts with careful observation and the recording of events. This point can be best i l l u s t r a t e d with a story. In the time of Julius"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"18 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries Caesar, there was a legendary bandit by the name of Procrustes. Now, a Procrustean bed which bears his name is an adjust able hospital bed. Legend had it that Procrustes would kidnap people, bring them to his home and force them to lie down on his bed. If they were too tall to fit his bed, he just cut off their legs and they bled to de ath. Too short? He put them on a rack and stretched them until they died s creaming. The highly regarded Dr. Edward Whitmont, homeopathic physician of New York City, likens the rigidity of the cruel Procrustes t o the rigid adherence to a methodology that blinds one to an obvious truth in medicine—that an alternative treatment works. The obsession with a r igidly narrow defini- tion of what constitutes scientific proof is more s lavishly believed by physician scientists than by modern physicists. Rec ognizing only this rigid, narrow definition of proof, orthodox medicin e holds a sword of Damocles* over their competition.

Dr. Ronald S. Laura and John F. Ashton DOES IT BENEFIT YOU? OR BIG BUSINESS! The controversy surrounding fluoridation raises a n umber of important socio-ethical issues which cannot be overlooked. On e of the most burning questions is whether the fluoridation programme rep resents a milestone in the advancement of community health or the opportun istic outcome of a powerful lobby concerned largely to advance its own vested interests at the expense of the interests of the public. The his torical origins of fluori- dation are revealing, though we shall for obvious r easons in what follows not interpret the revelation itself, but rather tea se out a few of the truly remarkable coincidences which make those origins re velatory. In a more direct approach to a related issue, howev er, we shall argue that the potential and actual health risks associated wi th fluoridation have not been sufficiently appreciated by those in favor of fluoridation. The inten- tional introduction of fluorides in drinking water has certainly not received the rigorous scrutiny and testing properly brought to bear on the wide array of available medical drugs, many of which can be bo ught without prescrip- tion. Finally, we urge that even if it were determi ned that the addition of a minimal amount of fluoride to our water supply was both safe and effective in the reduction of caries in the teeth of children , the relevant dosage of flu- orides could not be satisfactorily restricted to en sure that the harmful effects of fluoride did not outweigh the alleged beneficial effects.

Fluorides are believed to exert their toxic action on pests b y combining with and inhibiting many enzymes that contain elements such as iron, calcium and magnesium. For similar reasons fluorides are also h ighly toxic to plants, disrupting the delicate biochemical balance in resp ect of which photosyn- thesis takes place. Nor is there any reason to susp ect that humans are immune from the effects of this potent poison. Even a quick perusal of the indexes of most reference manuals on industrial tox icology list a section on the hazards of handling fluoride compounds. In a ssessing the toxicity levels of fluorides Sax confirms that doses of 25 t o 50 mg must be regard- ed as \"highly toxic\" and can cause severe vomiting, diarrhea and CNS manifestations. 1 It is crucial to recognise from the outset that flu oride is a highly toxic substance. Appreciation of this simple point makes it easier to understand the natural reluctance on the part of some to accep t without question the compulsory ingestion of a poison to obtain partial control of what would generally be regarded as a noncommunicable disease. The potent toxicity of fluoride and the narrow limits of human toleranc e (between 1-5 ppm) make the question of optimum concentration of param ount importance. FLUORINE WASTES-A MAJOR POLLUTANT The fluoridation controversy becomes even more inte resting when we realise that industrial fluorine wastes have since the early 1900s been one of the main pollutants of our lakes, streams and ac quifers, causing untold losses to farmers in regard to the poisoning of sto ck and crops. Fluorides such as hydrogen fluoride and silicon tet rafluoride are emit- ted by phosphate fertilizer manufacturing plants (p hosphate rock can typ- ically contain 3 percent fluoride). The industrial process of steel produc- tion, certain chemical processing and particularly aluminium production which involves the electrolysis of alumina in a bat h of molten cryolite (sodium aluminium hexafluoride) all release conside rable quantities of fluorides into the environment. The fluorides emitt ed are readily absorbed by vegetation and are known to cause substantial le af injury. Even in con- centrations as low as 0.1 ppb (parts per billion), fluorides significantly reduce both the growth and yield of crops. Livestoc k have also fallen vic- tim to fluoride poisoning caused primarily by inges ting contaminated veg- etation. 2 It is reported that the Aluminum Corporation of Am erica (ALCOA) was confronted by annual claims for million s to compensate for the havoc wreaked by their fluorine wastes. It was in 1933 that the United States Public Health Service (PHS) became pa rticularly concerned about the poisoning effect of fluoride on teeth det ermining that dental flu-"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Alternative Medical Therapies 21 orosis (teeth mottled with yellow, brown and even b lack stains) occurred amongst 25-30 percent of children when just over 1 ppm of fluoride was present in drinking water. 3 By 1942 the PHS, largely under the guidance of Dr. H. Trendley Dean, legislated that drinking w ater containing up to 1 ppm of fluoride was acceptable. The PHS was not at this stage introduc- ing fluoridation—it was concerned mainly to define the maximum allow- able limit beyond which fluoride concentrations sho uld be regarded as contaminating public water supplies. Dean's researc h investigations also indicated that although 1 ppm fluoride concentratio n caused enamel fluo- rosis or mottling in a small percentage of children (up to 10 percent), it also served to provide partial protection against d ental decay. 4 HOW IT ALL STARTED Dean was also well aware that fluoride concentratio ns of as little as 2 ppm could constitute a public health concern, causing s evere dental fluorosis. Coincidentally, the U.S. PHS was at the time sponso red under the Depart- ment of the Treasury, the chief officer of which wa s Andrew Mellon, owner of ALCOA. In 1939 The Mellon Institute (estab lished and con- trolled by the family of Andrew Mellon), employed a scientist, Dr. Gerald Cox, to find a viable market for the industrial flu oride wastes associated with the production of aluminium. Of this intriguin g series of connections between the interests of ALCOA and the story of flu oridation Walker writes: In 1939, Gerald Cox, a biochemist employed by the U niversity of Pittsburgh, was undertaking contract work for the M ellon Institute. At a meeting of water engineers at Johnstown, Penns ylvania, he first put forward his idea to add fluoride to public wate r supplies. By 1940, Cox had become a member of the Food and Nu trition Board of the National Research Council, and he prepared f or this illustrious body a series of submissions strongly promoting the idea of artificial flu- oridation. 5 Dennis Stevenson also comments about this connectio n between Dr. Cox, ALCOA and fluoridation but somewhat more cynic ally. He writes: Dr. Cox then proposed artificial water fluoridation as a means of reduc- ing tooth decay. What better way to solve the huge and costly problem of disposing of toxic waste from aluminum manufactu rers than getting paid to put it in the drinking water?

In fact, many of the non-fluoridated cities had better tooth decay rates than fluoridate d cities. The city with the lowest rate of tooth decay was not fluorid ated. Of the three with the highest rate of decay, two were part ially fluoridated.

In 1945 Grand Rapids, Michigan was selected as the site of the first major lon- gitudinal study of the effects of fluoridation on t he public at large. Comparisons were to be made with the city of Muskeg on, Michigan which remained unfluoridated so that it could be us ed as a control. 9 Although the experiment was supposed to be undertak en over the course of ten years to determine any cumulative sid e-effects which might result from the fluoridation of municipal water, Ew ing intervened after only five years to declare the success of the study in showing fluoridation to be safe. As Walker puts it: In June, 1950, half-way through the experiment, the U.S. PHS under its Chief, Oscar Ewing, \"endorsed\" the safety and effec tiveness of artifi- cial fluoridation; and encouraged its immediate ado ption through the States. 10 One year later Ewing was able to convince the Ameri can Congress that fluoridation was a necessity, and a total of two mi llion U.S. dollars (an enormous sum of money in those days) was immediatel y directed to pro- mote the fluoridation program throughout the USA. 11 While the circumstances surrounding Ewing's achieve ment were revealing, an even more intriguing set of interconn ections was yet to be revealed.

A redefinition of ethics is necessary . .. the subject matter of the propaganda need not necessarily be true,\" says Bernays.

One letter complained that the review er was in fact explicit- ly urging readers not to take seriously the various reports of fluoride poi- soning. 15 Another letter writer drew attention to another as pect of the review, saying: Waldbott does not base his objection to fluoridatio n merely on dental flu- orosis but on the broader issue of individual clini cal toxicity. Those of us in clinical practice (and our patients as well) hav e much to be grateful to Waldbott for in our attention to this aspect of flu oridation problems. The alert clinician who goes beyond the orthodox practi ce of making diag- noses keyed to organicity and providing symptomatic treatment will find in his practice those individuals who are being mad e ill by fluoridation. It is this insight that is Waldbott's greatest contrib ution . . . A second major point bypassed in the book review is the fact of dra- matically increased dietary fluoride exposure, as c onfirmed by the data of Rose and Marier (Canadian National Research Council ), Herta Spencer, Wiatroski, and others, including my own food fluori de study ... It bog- gles the mind to argue, as the U.S. Public Health S ervice does, that \"opti- mal\" water fluoridation levels should be the same i n 1979 as they were in 1943 when food fluoride was essentially negligible. It is ironic that if fluoridation were to be raised as new concept for the pre- vention of tooth decay today, the same government a gencies that might employ reviewer Burt would reject the proposal with out a second thought. It is only an accident of historical scientific naivet e that fluoridation became an entrenched public policy. The fact that 100 million Americans (and a large percentage of them against their expressed desire) are subject to the unnec- essary ecologic burden of water fluoridation does n ot make it right... 16 Mandatory medication by fluoridation was not of cou rse peculiar to the United States. Australians have for more than three decades been subject- ed to forced fluoridation of their drinking water. In 1953 the National Health & Medical Research Council of Australia lent its support to the mandatory mass-medication of Australians. 17 It is bizarre and disconcert- ing to find that the introduction of the fluoridati on programme into our cities was also linked with political and industria l interplay. These con- nections have been deftly exposed by Walker and mor e recently by Wendy Varney in her book, Fluoride in Australia—A Case to Answer. 18 Today, Australia has \"distinguished\" itself by prom oting the fluorida- tion programme with such vigour that Australia now ranks as the most"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"26 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries comprehensively fluoridated country in the world. M ore than 70 percent of Australians are obliged to drink water to which fluorides have been added. Brisbane is the only capital city which rema ins unfluoridated. Australia persists in its policy committment to art ificial fluoridation, despite the fact that 98 percent of the world's pop ulation has either dis- continued fluoridation programmes or never begun th em. Statistics show that less than 40 percent of the U. S. is currently fluori- dated and less than 10 percent of England. Sweden, Scotland, Norway, Hungary, Holland, West Germany, Denmark, and Belgiu m have all dis- continued fluoridation, to name only a few. 19 CAN FLUORIDATION BE KEPT AT SAFE LEVELS? Although 1 ppm is standardly defined as that level of fluoride concentra- tion which provides maximal protection against dent al decay, with mini- mal clinically observable dental fluorosis, controv ersy ranges widely as to adverse effects of prolonged fluoride exposure even at this level. As early as 1942, it was reported that in areas of endemic f luorosis with fluoride concentrations of 1 ppm or less, children with poor nutrition suffered skele- tal defects, coupled with severe mottling of teeth. Even if one grants that fluoride concentrations of 1 ppm are relatively safe, it has become increasingly clear that individ ual levels of safe fluo- ride ingestion cannot be adequately controlled. Dri nking water dosages of fluoride, for example will depend partly upon varia ble factors such as thirst. Liquid intakes also vary according to age, work situation, climate and season and levels of exercise. Athletes, for in stance, tend to consume more water than their non-athletic counterparts. Ad justments to municipal water supplies cannot accommodate satisfactorily th e wide array of rele- vant individual differences of this kind. In addition fluorides are ingested in varying quant ities from many unsuspected sources. Fluoride tablets, seemingly in nocuous mouthwash- es, gels and even water-based tablets contribute to dangerous increases in fluoride levels well beyond the recommended 1 ppm c ontained in drink- ing water. Although the point has yet to be establi shed definitively, it has been suggested that aluminum cooking utensils and n on-stick cookware which are coated with Tetrafluoroethylene may exude fluoride into food, particularly if they have surface scratches or are overheated. 20 Even more surprising is the fact that tea leaves contain suff icient fluoride that by drinking three to eight cups daily, using fluoridat ed water, the total fluo- ride dosage is somewhere between four and six times the safe maximum recommended daily allowance. 21 In addition to endemic fluorides in the natural foods we eat, we are in many industrial cit ies forced to breathe flu- orides derived from factory emissions. 22 "},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Alternative Medical Therapies 27 FLUORIDE CONTAMINATION FROM BEVERAGE CONSUMPTION By far the most common source of additional fluorid e intake comes from beverage consumption. Beverages which contain fluor idated water in- clude reconstituted juices, punches, popsicles, oth er water-based frozen desserts and carbonated beverages. Studies have sho wn that soft drink consumption in the U.S. has increased markedly over the last two decades, not only among teenage boys from 15-17 yea rs of age, but among 1-2 year old children. Statistics show that i n Canada soft drink consumption increased by 37 percent from 1972 to 19 81. 23 The increase in soft drink consumption coincided with a decrease in the consumption of milk, thereby increasing the overall fluoride in take. A number of stud- ies reveal that the dramatic increase in beverage c onsumption, coupled with fluoridation of municipal waters constitutes a potential health haz- ard. 24 Prolonged exposure to fluorides may actually incre ase rather than diminish the incidence of tooth decay. Enzymatic da mage related to enamel mineralisation creates a parotic tooth far m ore susceptible to caries than would otherwise be the case. 25 In a major study of adverse effects of fluoride, Yi amouyiannis and Burk reported in 1977 that at least 10,000 people in the U.S. die every year of fluoride-induced cancer. In the introduction to the ir work 17 research papers are cited which demonstrate the mutagenic ef fects associated with fluorides. 26 There is now side consensus within the scientific community that the mutagenic activity of a substance can be r egarded as an important indication of its potential cancer-causing activity . Since those provocative studies over a decade ago, a vast scientific lit- erature has continued to accumulate which strongly indicates that the practice of fluoridating municipal water supplies i s dangerous. In 1983 an Australian dental surgeon, G. Smith, reported a num ber of studies which suggest that there is now a serious risk to the pub lic of fluoride overdose. He argues that \"the crucial argument does not conce rn the fluoride lev- el in a community water supply per se, but rather w hether fluoridation increases the risk that certain people develop, eve n for a short time, levels of fluoride in the blood that can damage human cell s and systems.\" 27 In 1985 another Australian scientist, M. Diesendorf , drew attention to the discovery of a whole new dimension to the healt h hazards associated with the ingestion of fluorides. Sodium fluoride, f or example, had been found to cause unscheduled DNA synthesis and chromo sonal aberrations in certain human cells. 28 Other recent studies purport to reveal the actual mechanism by virtue of which fluoride can disrupt t he DNA molecule and the ac t i ve sites of the molecules of many human enz ymes. 29 "},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"28 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries When all is said, it is manifestly clear that the t ime has come for a seri- ous and comprehensive review of the policy which ma ndates the compul- sory fluoridation of our municipal water supplies. Such a review will no doubt require a multi-faceted approach in which rel iable research investi- gations can be integrated with a philosophy of heal th education to assist their implementation. Through education it may be p ossible to appreciate that within nature itself are important patterns of design for an overall pro- gramme of health. In nature, for instance, fluoride s are typically found in decidedly insoluble forms which are relatively safe . By deliberately inter- vening to make nature's insoluble forms of fluoride soluble we transform a relatively harmless natural substance into a conc entrated and highly toxic substance which can then be indiscriminately dispersed throughout the environment as a poison. The subtle constellati on of health clues which nature provides in respect of fluorides is fu rther illustrated by the simple but elegant mechanisms of breastfeeding. Bre astfed infants are actually protected from receiving more than extreme ly low concentrations of fluoride in breast milk by an inbuilt physiologi cal plasma/milk barrier against fluoride. 30 There is much about health to learn from nature, b ut to do so we must be more concerned to join with nature in partnership than to stand back from nature to subdue and manipulate it. Whether the fluoridation campaign must be indicted in the light of the evidence as one of the major public hoaxes perpetra ted this century, is a judgement best reserved for the reader. Whatever th e judgment, it is incon- testable that the prevention of tooth decay is not the bottom-line of the flu- oridation debate when the panacea has become the po ison.

In fact, chronic merc ury toxicity from such fillings ranks among our most serious public health problems. The modern dental amalgam, widely misnamed \"silver\" and used in fillings for more than 180 years, now accounts for 79-80 percent of all dental restorations. 1 In truth, however, it contains only about 35 perce nt silver by weight, compared to 50 percent mercury (w ith 13 percent tin, and small amounts of copper and zinc). 2 Citing the silver-mercury ratio, Murray Vimy, profe ssor in the De- partment of Medicine at the University of Calgary ( Canada), notes that average amalgam fillings have a mercury mass of 750 -1,000 milligrams (mg) and should more properly be called mercury fil lings. They have a functional life of about 7-9 years, after which the y are usually replaced with another one made of the same material. 3,4 Mercury is more toxic than lead or even arsenic. Co nsidering the mountains of scientific information that have accum ulated over the last 70 years, which clearly show the poisonous effects of mercury, using it today in dentistry is simply criminal. Yet each year worl dwide, hundreds of tons of this toxic material are placed into patients' te eth, while some finds its way from dental offices into sewage and refuse syst ems, to poison the environment instead of the patients. The American Dental Association (ADA) and governmen t scientists know mercury's potential and actual harm, yet conti nue to promote its use. They thus make a direct, if covert assault on Ameri ca's health while pro- ducing large profits for themselves and their speci al interest group. Appropriately, such crimes are punishable by death under the Crime Bill of 1994 and United Nations rules concerning genocid e. 5 Within the dental profession, t h e issue of mercury- filling safety has re- curred periodically. Introduced in 1812 by British chemist Joseph Bell, the"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"32 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries \"silver paste\"—a combination of old silver coins an d mercury—became fashionable for tooth restoration. Since the coins were not pure silver, the material often expanded, fracturing teeth and/or gi ving patients a \"high bite.\" When it was first introduced in the United States ( in 1833 in New York), dentists rebelled. They refused to use the \" silver\" because it caused immediate symptoms of mercury poisoning. Within the first 10 years most dentists denounced its poor filling qualities and t oxic nature, forming the American Society of Dental Surgeons in 1840 to decl are mercury usage malpractice. The society mandated that its members sign an oath not to use materials containing mercury. Nevertheless, amalgam increased in popularity, part icularly among poor- ly-educated practitioners; it was cheaper than gold —the standard until then—giving the renegades an economic edge over the ir colleagues who demanded higher quality. (In those days many nonpro fessionals, includ- ing itinerant peddlers, were filling teeth for the pioneer population also.) Besides, amalgam fillings were user-friendly—for th e dentist, not the patient—and durable in the mouth. By 1856, the anti-amalgam society had lost so many members that it had to disband, while wealthy businessmen (not dent ists) founded a new group to push the toxic material: the ADA. For a ti me the debate was dead. The poison had won; the patients had lost. 6,7 MERCURY AND THE BRAIN In the 1920s another controversy erupted after Dr. Alfred Stock, a German chemistry professor, published articles and letters attacking mercury fill- ings for their possible toxic effects. By 1935, Sto ck's research proved that some of the mercury vapor coming from dental amalga ms enters the nose, is absorbed by the mucosa and passes rapidly into t he brain: It was found in the olfactory lobe and in the pineal gland. Afte r a while, however, the furor surrounding Stock's findings also died down. Now, nearly 150 years after its founding—and in the midst of its third \"amalgam war\"—the ADA is trying to kill the debate for all time: It has amended its code of ethics to condemn the removal o f serviceable mer- cury fillings as unethical, if the reason is to eli minate a toxic material from the body and if the recommendation is made solely b y the dentist. 8 According to Professor Vimy, the ADA considers a de ntist ethical if he places the poisonous substance and recommends its s afety. However, if he suggests that mercury fillings are potentially harm ful or that exposure to unnecessary mercury can be, he is acting unethicall y. Serviceable mercury fillings can be \"ethically\" removed if clone for ae sthetic reasons, at the request of the patient (without prompting) or a med ical doctor."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Alternative Medical Therapies 33 In 1967, the inaugural issue of Environmental Resea rch magazine fea- tured \"Mercury-Blood Interaction and Mercury Uptake by the Brain After Exposure,\" the research of L. Magos. His experiment s with mice indicat- ed that inhaled mercury reaches the brain. Mercury amalgam continuously gives off vapor, and, inhaled, it has an incredibly high absorption rate—between 70 and 100 percent! Once in the brain, mercury oxidizes into its elemental form. Th en the blood-brain bar- rier, designed to protect the brain from foreign su bstances in the blood, works against its own purpose, preventing the remov al of the toxic metal from the brain. Nonetheless, in 1976, the FDA pronounced its \"accep tance\" of mercury amalgam, since \"it had been in use since 1840.\" It was added to the Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) list of pre-193 0 drugs. In 1979, perhaps as a reaction to the FDA ruling, r esearch began appearing which documented that mercury vapor is co nstantly released from fillings, especially when they are stimulated by chewing, brushing or temperature shifts (such as drinking a hot liquid). Every time someone with amalgam fillings eats or brushes his teeth, th e leaching of mercury into the body peaks. Afterwards, it takes almost 90 minutes for the vapor- ization rate to decline to its previous level. 9 Also, the greater the number of fillings and the la rger the chewing-surface area they occupy, the greater the toxic exposure. 10, 11 Since hot liquids also increase vaporizing, individuals with amalgam filli ngs who frequently drink tea or coffee run a higher risk of mercury-related pathologies. The average person, with eight biting-surface mercu ry fillings, is exposed to a daily-dose uptake of about 10 mcg (mic rograms) of mercury from his fillings. 12 Some individuals may have daily doses 10 times hig h- er (100 mcg) because of factors that exacerbate mer cury vaporization, such as more frequent eating, chronic gum chewing, chronic tooth grind- ing (usually during sleep), chewing patterns, consu mption of hot or acidic foods and drinks, and mouth acidity. 13 Furthermore, Professor Vimy asserts the concentrati on of mercury in the brain correlates with the number of fillings pr esent. In 1980, the World Health Organization (WHO) admitted, \"The most hazar dous forms of mercury to human health are elemental mercury vapor and the short-chain alkyl-mercurials.\" 14 By 1984, autopsy studies were published that demons trated that the amount of mercury found in brain and kidney tissue directly relates to the number of mercury amalgam fdlings in the teeth.

As the existence of the ADA has gradually become in tegrated into the public's awareness, the perception has grown up tha t its statements repre- sent scientific truth. The association and its memb ers know that a condi- tioned and ignorant public will rarely question any statement it makes. Thus, when it issues false statements that jeopardi ze public health, such as recommending that deadly toxins be placed in the bo dy, it is party to a criminal act. Having third-party dentists do the di rty deeds does not excuse the association, especially since its member s have spent years and much money studying in ADA-approved schools, and an yone who bucks the system risks his license, his income and his ca reer. This constitutes extortion and racketeering by the ADA, punishable u nder the RICO Act. 15 DISCOVERIES AND REVELATIONS IN THE 1990S 1990—On December 16, CBS's 60 Minutes did a major s tory on the amalgam issue that generated the second-highest res ponse for additional information in the history of the program.

They also sent press releases to all the major media and even created a special program for dentis ts entitled \"What To Tell Your Patients When They Ask About Amalgam.\" Also appearing in 1990 was the first controlled res earch on the effects of amalgam implants. It cited significant effects o f mercury amalgam on various tissues and organs in experiments with monk eys and sheep. 1991—Sweden banned the use of mercury amalgam impla nts. In March, the FDA recommended \"further studies,\" an d consumer groups and legislators began introducing informed c onsent legislation whereby dentists would be required to inform patien ts of the content of amalgam fillings (implants) and the potentially har mful effects of mercury. In May, a medical research team at the University o f Kentucky estab- lished \"a probable relationship of mercury exposure from mercury-amal- gam fillings to both Alzheimer's disease and cardio vascular disease.\" University of Georgia microbiologists determined th at mercury from fill- ings inhibits the effectiveness of antibiotics. The WHO reported that exposure to mercury from amal gams is higher than that of other environmental sources and that e ach amalgam filling releases from three to seventeen micrograms of merc ury daily during eat- ing alone. The WHO audited all available scientific data on the subject and concluded that mercury from dental fillings is the greatest source of human exposure, exceeding intake from fish by about 200 percent. 1993—The International Academy of Oral Medicine and Toxicology (IAOMT) developed a certification program for bioco mpatible dentistry [using materials compatible with each patient's bod y chemistry]. Dentists certified by the IAOMT will have \"demonstrated prof iciency in replacing amalgams safely and properly.\" Swedish researchers discovered that gastrointestina l function improves after amalgam is removed.

BBC'S \"PANORAMA\" PANS AMALGAM On July 11, 1994, the British BBC-1 documentary pro gram Panorama focused on the amalgam controversy. Dr. Lars Friber g, chief advisor to the WHO on metals poisoning, told Panorama, \"The use of mercury in den- tal fillings is not safe and should be avoided.\" Th e program also reported on new scientific research which demonstrated clear links between the mercury released from dental fillings and serious i llness, including Alzheimer's disease. Dr. Friberg told Panorama that he \"did not know why \" the British Dental Association considers mercury levels in amal gam \"safe\" and that he thought, \"They are wrong.\" He was concerned part icularly about depo- sition of mercury from fillings into the brains of children. According to Dr. Friberg, [W]e know that children are especially vulnerable t o the amalgam. We know that it takes a few years after birth until th e brain is developed, and we know the brains in children are much more sensit ive than those of adults. I think that you should try to avoid the im plantation of toxic met- als in the mouth. There is no safe level of mercury , and no one has actu- ally shown that there is a safe level. I say mercur y is a very toxic sub- stance. I would like to avoid it as far as possible . Panorama investigated a number of new, independent studies, some unpublished, which point inexorably towards the hea lth risks of amalgam fillings. The first is a new study by Dr. Boyd Hale y, professor of bio- chemistry at the University of Kentucky. He discove red that small quan- tities of mercury from amalgams can produce changes in the brain identi- cal to those caused by Alzheimer's disease. Mercury inhibits the efficien- cy of tubulin, a protein vital to brain cells. According to Dr. Haley: To the best that we can determine with these experi ments, mercury is a time bomb in the brain. We need to have an effect—i f it's not bothering someone when they are young, especially when they a ge, it could turn into something quite disastrous. I still have one a malgam filling. When I had the others replaced, I had them replaced with n onamalgam fillings. I would not make the statement that mercury causes Alzheimer's dis- ease, hut there is no doubt in my mind that low lev els of mercury, pre- sent in the brain, could cause normal cell death th at could lead to a dementia which would be similar to Alzheimer's dise ase."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Alternative Medical Therapies 39 Panorama also reported on the unique, ongoing study of a group of nuns by Dr. William Markesbery, professor of pathology a nd neurology and director of the Sanders Brown Center for Aging at t he University of Kentucky. He is investigating the link between merc ury and Alzheimer's disease and told Panorama: Mercury is a toxic substance. It is a neurotoxin—th at is to say it causes nerve cells to degenerate if there is enough mercur y present in the brain. The major problem in Alzheimer's disease is the degeneration of nerve cells. It is possible that mercury could add to the degeneration of nerve cells—to the death of nerve cells. The reaction of the British Dental Association (BDA ) to the 1994 Panorama program was predictable: It told Panorama it was unaware of the work of Haley and also unaware of the work of P rofessor Aposhian at the University of Arizona who discovered that 66 pe rcent of the mercury deposits in the body come from fillings. In fact, J ohn Hunt, chief execu- tive of the BDA, told Panorama, \"Amalgam is safe.\" The BDA fact sheet available to dentists states, \"The scientific evide nce available to the BDA does not justify banning the use of amalgam in youn g children.\" Said Hunt, \"I've treated my children with amalgam a nd have no doubt that when they have their own children, they will d o the same.\" Asked about any link between Alzheimer's and mercury, he added: As far as I know, there is no association with merc ury and Alzheimer's. We rely on expert advice. There is no evidence to s uggest that merely because mercury is found in the kidneys of the fetu s and young children, that it is a hazard to health. I don't see why we s hould necessarily worry the population at large if there are no proven argu ments one way or another. The fact that it is there and it is detect able doesn't mean to say that it's potentially doing any damage. You can pro bably find a whole lot of substances in the brain that perhaps should not be there.

In the United States, not less than seven thousand researchers, scien- tists, physicians and dentists are aware of at leas t part of the following information. Approximately half of that number, tho se that practice mer- cury-free dentistry and the physicians who support them feel threatened by their medical societies and state medical and de ntal boards. Scott McAdoo, D.D.S., of Denver, Colorado, who is one of the most skilled dentists I had the pleasure of going to said, \"To a dvertise that you are a mercury-free dentist is like standing in a foxhole. \" The Colorado State Dental Board is after his license. The only scientists and physicians that does not fe el themselves at risk are our toxicologists, who have been trying for yea rs to tell the public that mercury in \"silver\" fillings is a deadly poison. Th e Toxicology Society has published dozens of research papers about the t oxicity of mercury. Unfortunately, the American Dental Association (ADA ) has enough eco- nomic-political power to shut down the very doctors the public should be listening to. Most medical research is funded by the pharmaceutic al industry and researchers are disinclined to shoot their wallet i n the toe. For example, a ten day cure for peptic ulcers was discovered over eleven years ago. Most ulcers are caused by H-pylori bacterial infection. I wrote about H-pylori in Beating Alzheimer's in December of 1989. The Oct ober 1995 issue of Readers Digest reports less than half of United Sta tes doctors know how to treat their 25 million ulcers patients correctly . \"Doctors may be unwill- ing to try the new methods, while drug companies ma y be (are) reluctant to abandon the lucrative antacid market.\" Zantac an d Tagamet are two of the fastest selling medications for ulcers in the U nited States. Doctor Joel Wallach, M.D., D.V.M., who performed ov er 27 thousand autopsies on animals as well as 10 thousand autopsi es on humans told me whatever disease the cadaver exhibited, malnutritio n was the underlying cause of death.

They grew so huge du ring the summer that I had to cut them down to dirt and start over. I use both products now. Malnutrition is a sub-clinical symptom evolved in t he Alzheimer's dis- ease process. I have heard physicians say people wa ste their money on vitamins and minerals, that we just piss them down the drain. What do they think happens to pharmaceuticals? I prefer to piss fifty cents worth of vitamins and minerals every day than die from Al zheimer's, or to have wasted more than a hundred thousand dollars going t o doctors who did not have the slightest idea of how to reverse Alzheimer 's, or any other chron- ic disease. All the traditional doctors did was was te my time and take my money. None of them—not one—had the slightest idea of what to do. In addition, the traditional medical community harasse d every doctor I went to who knew anything about reversing chronic diseas e. If a physician cures patients other doctors cannot, his peers shun him, and medical boards do their damnedest to ruin his reputation, h is practice and take his license. The bottom line is arrogance, ignorance an d money. Mostly, it's the money. I have a friend who was perhaps, the most informed physician within his area of expertise, in America. He wrote more th an eight hundred research papers that were published in peer review medical journals. He was personal physician to some of the most powerful men in the world. He is in Who's Who in the United States and Who's W ho of the world. At the university where he taught, doctors have large practices. My friend was not bringing in as much money as the good old b oys wanted so they started directing indigent patients his way. His pa tients had a higher recovery rate than his colleagues who were charging significantly higher fees. Their patients learned of this, and dropped t heir physicians to go to my friend. The university fired him. He sued and wo n $300 thousand. But he is out of the circle; he is not considered one o f the good old boys any- more. The traditional medical community pretends he does not exist. He is shunned. The pressure caused his marriage to fal l apart. He has taken to drugs and is very ill. His license has been revoked . All his tomorrows are yesterdays. A PARALLAX VIEW Suppose that you were a foreign intelligence office r looking for the per- fect undetectable poison to destroy an enemy in a w ay that brought no repercussions to yourself. Suppose that your resear ch scientists discov- ered a low-level, slow-acting poison, a liquid meta l, that is the most lethal non-radioactive element in the Periodic Table.

If you could induce your enemy's dentists to insert this diabolical tox in into their patient's oral cavity \"two inches from the brain\" in 85 percent of your enemy's popula- tion, you would wreak havoc on the whole fabric of their society. You could put hundreds of thousands of their citizenry in mental hospitals. You could destroy whole families. Sick people are ineff icient, troublesome workers. They fill the welfare rolls. They fill the prisons. You could cause hundreds of billions of dollars of taxes to be spen t supporting institution- alized mental patients and imprisoned no-accounts. You could cause your enemy to spend trillions of dollars on unnecessary medical bills before poisoned patients expire. In addition, sick under-e mployed workers can- not pay taxes. The best part is that the last perso n anyone would suspect of poisoning them is their dentist. If the above parody were true, if it was discovered that any nation caused tens of millions 1 of our population the devastation I just described , we would declare war. This discovery would be consi dered \"A Day in Infamy.\" Unfortunately, the only incongruity in the above scenario is that there is no foreign intelligence officer. I wish th ere were. It would make the following information more palatable. This is what has been covered up: 1. The primary cause of Alzheimer's is iatrogenic dise ase, doctor-induced disease, from so-called \"silver\" dental fillings th at poison the brain and nervous system. Mercury in silver dental fillings h as an affinity for brain tissue and easily passes through the blood-br ain barrier. Mercury vapor ions are too miniscule to be recognized by th e autoimmune sys- tem until enough mercury accumulates upon the nerve sheath that sur- rounds the synapses. At that point our autoimmune s ystem does not recognize the tissue as self and attacks the nerve sheath as if it were a foreign invader. 2. If an Alzheimer's sufferer can carry on a half-way reasonable conver- sation for five minutes, do not let uninformed phys icians persuade you that Alzheimer's is not reversible. An anesthes iologist who read Beating Alzheimer's checked and rechecked my inform ation with den- tists and physicians for six months, then removed t hirteen root canals. He recovered from Alzheimer's disease in two hours flat.

The corr ect name for Alz- heimer's should be \"Chronic Low-Level Mercurial Poi soning.\" Mercury poisoning from silver dental fillings is a causativ e factor in the majority of people diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. And I charge that the ADA has covered up their culpability in the same way ci garette manufacturers and Dow Chemical, who produced silicone breast impl ants, denied their products' connection to disease. Those of us who have had our lives turned upside do wn by mercury poisoning could live with the fact our dentists mad e an appalling mistake in not recognizing the toxicity of mercury sooner. What we will not toler- ate is the fact that the ADA did everything within its power to stonewall the fact that silver fillings were poisoning their patients. They allowed over ten million silver amalgam fillings to be plac ed into our mouths, two inches from our brain, after there was evidence poi nting to serious prob- lems due to mercury poisoning from silver amalgam. The ADA tried to protect their profits and their reputations, not th eir patients. In the mean- time thousands of dental patients have unnecessaril y suffered catastroph- ic diseases. If it seems impossible to believe that our dentists would cover- up the fact that they have poisoned a minimum of 12 percent of our pop- ulation, read the inset on page 47. If physicians knew mercury was poisonous, dentists had to know mer- cury was poisonous. It's that simple. Since 1830, t he hierarchy—the good old boys in the ADA and our dental professors, must have known that den- tists were placing poison into their patients' mout hs. They lied to their dental students. They lied to us. In polite company another name for a lie is a \"misnomer.\" Dentists called mercury-amalga m, silver-amalgam. Silver filling is a misnomer. That is a cover-up by any definition of \"cover-up\" that I understand. And that's fraud. The ADA admitted that five percent of dental patien ts were allergic to silver amalgam. There is no such thing as allergy h ere. The ADA is trying to argue that a poison is not a poison. Goodman and Gilman's 1990 edi- tion of The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics s ays, \"With very few exceptions, mercury poisoning is most often not dia gnosed in patients because of the insidious onset of the affliction, v agueness of early clinical signs, and the medical profession's unfamiliarity w ith the disease.\" It is impossible to estimate how many millions of p eople died from chronic diseases due to mercury poisoning. The ADA claimed only 5 per- cent 2 (13 million) of dental patients were allergic to s ilver amalgam—that is, until the Center for Disease Control pointed ou t that by definition: that's an epidemic. Then the ADA changed their tune to one percent. Even so, that figure is 2,600,000 denial patients they a dmitted poisoning. The"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"46 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries last I heard the ADA was saying it is just a minisc ule amount—less than a hundred. Finally even mainstream media had enough. A CBS 60 Minutes special entitled \"Is There Poison in Your Mouth?\" ran natio nwide December 16, 1990 that included fantastic recoveries when mercur y-amalgam fillings were replaced. \"Is There Poison in Your Mouth?\" was the most highly viewed television program 60 Minutes ever produced. CBC's Panorama followed up with \"The Poison In Your Mouth\" that ai red in London. These two programs destroyed the credibility of the dental industry. The ADA knew that if they could not put a spin on the r evelations exposed in those two television news stories their days were n umbered. THE WITCH HUNTS In two states, Colorado and Minnesota, the dental b oards have used the Attorney General's Office and millions of dollars o f public tax money to take away licenses of dentists and physicians who i nform their patients that mercury-amalgam is the etiology of the disease they are suffering. The Colorado Attorney General's Office spent $4 mil lion over a twenty- two year period investigating Doctor Hal Huggins an d eventually revoked his license. Before Hal decided the fight was not w orth the effort anymore he had spent over $700 thousand in legal fees. The AMA took Doctor Sandra Denton's Colorado medical license because sh e was associated with Doctor Huggins. Sandra Denton is one of the sm artest, most dedi- cated physicians that I have ever known. She was se t up. Sandy did not do anything wrong. The Colorado Medical Board took her license to under- mine Doctor Huggins' support within the medical com munity. I know many critically ill patients that Doctor Den ton helped. One young woman was dying by the hour. Other physicians offered no expla- nation for, or understanding of her illness. Doctor Denton correctly diag- nosed the woman's condition and canceled half of he r appointments over a two week period to care for this one indigent pat ient. She had her nurs- es watch over the young woman constantly. Area surg eons refused to operate because the woman was so close to death. Do ctor Denton found a corporate jet to fly her patient from Seattle to Co lorado Springs. Two oral surgeons removed titanium implants within the lower jaw and all of her silver fillings. Both surgeons laughed at Doctor De nton. They told Sandra the patient would die on the table. The young woman started to recover two hours after surgery. Six months later she had two titanium posts reimplanted into h er lower jaw to anchor her lower dentures in place and rapidly became schizoph renic. Doctor Denton pleaded with her surgeons to remove the implants, a nd [the patient] quickly recovered. Several years have gone by and the woman leads a normal life."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Alternative Medical Therapies 47 Dentistry: Stepping Out of the 1830s James E. Hardy, D.M.D. Mercury's use in dentistry has been the subject of my studies for the past 14 years. I thought I knew the history of the mercury- amalgam controversy well, but yesterday I pulled a book down from my shelf that a patient of mine had given me. It was a bound volume of Dental Students' Magazine, dated 1942 and 1943. What I read gave me new insight into the history of mercury- amalgam and its intimate relationship with organize d dentistry. Dentistry in the U.S. did not develop as a separate profession until the period of 1780 to 1800. There were two ty pes of \"dentists\" at this time. There were those who had m edical training and practiced both professions. These were medical- dentists. Then there were those who were merely cra ftsmen and engaged in some other trade, such as barbering, carving of wood, ivory, and metals . . . among them were th e itinerant tooth pullers. These were called craftsmen-dentists . There were no American national dental organization s and no dental schools in existence before 1840. Dentists w ere either self taught by \"trial and error\" on patients or wer e apprenticed under a practicing medical-dentist. The first dental school was chartered in the United States [on] February 1, 1840. It was called the Baltimore College of Dental Surgery. It is of interest to note that the Board of the College of Dental Surgery was composed of nine phys icians and five Clergymen; no dentists. Originally, the sc hool was to be a graduate program for medical schools as it was only one session long and did not include any chemistry or p athology. But as it turns out, this was the beginning of dent al training separating itself from medical education. Also founded in 1840 was the first national dental organization. It was called the American Society of Dental Surgeo ns. Its members were medical-dentists, not barbers, carpent ers, or sculptors. The medical-dentists were vitally concer ned with the medical, biological and mechanical aspects of denti stry. The craftsmen-dentists were concerned with the mechanic al aspects and did not consider medical questions. Mercury-amalgam was first brought into the U.S. fro m Europe"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"48 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries by the Crawcour brothers in 1833. They had a very s trong, effective advertising campaign that promised to sav e decayed teeth by filling them without pain in minutes. The Crawcours were considered unethical charlatans by many medica l-dentists. They removed gold fillings and replaced them with m ercury- amalgams. They did not dry decayed teeth or even re move the decay before they packed the hole. There were even some reports of their packing amalgam between teeth when there were no cavities at all. This began the first amalg am war. The amalgam war was the war between the craftsman i dea of ease of manipulation and the medical intent to a void the danger of systemic mercurial poisoning. Mercury was clearly known to be poisonous by the physicians in the 1830 s. In 1845, the American Society of Dental Surgeons ba nned the use of (mercury) silver-amalgams, making the me mbers sign a pledge of non-use and promise to oppose its use under any circumstances or be expelled from the Society. Remember, this Society was restricted to medical-dentists. A great number of craftsmen-dentists picked up the use of silver-amalgam. They were not concerned with the medical ramifications of mercury in the human system. Anato my, chemistry, histology, pathology and physiology were considered irrelevant to the craftsmen-dentists. So many denti sts began using amalgam (because it was easy to use and very profitable) that membership growth in the American Society of D ental Surgeons (ASDS) was curtailed. The ASDS decided to rescind their anti-amalgam resolution in 1850 in hopes of g aining more members. But the craftsmen-dentists had already dec ided to organize and associate with each other. In 1859, a new dental organization arose composed l argely of craftsmen-dentists. It was called the American D ental Association. The average dentist in the newly-forme d ADA was no longer one who was in sympathy with medicine. As a result, physicians adopted an extremely adverse attitude to ward the profession. During this time, dental schools droppe d courses in physiology, pathology, and materia medica and did n o anatomy except head and neck. In Dental Students' Magazine, October 1942, an edit orial states hopefully, \"The dental profession eagerly aw aits . . . their legitimate rights as members of the healing arts.\" To this day, these feelings linger.

The use of mercury in dentistry has onl y recently been banned in Germany. (Austria, Sweden, Denmark a nd Canada have either banned, or curtailed the use of silver amalgam fillings. Switzerland has stopped dental sc hools from teaching about silver amalgam.) Some day it will be banned in the United States. We've known the truth all alo ng. Mercury is poisonous. All truth passes through three stages. First, it is ridiculed. Second, it is violently opposed. Third, it is accepted as being self evident. —Schopenhauer All quotations and background information for Denti stry was taken from Dental Students' Magazine, November 1942 and Septem ber 1942. Doctor Denton moved to Anchorage, Alaska, where she was instru- mental in getting the state law changed so it is mo re difficult for medical boards to revoke a non-traditional physician's lice nse. Several years ago, I thought enough of her expertise to drive the Alca n highway from Seattle, Washington to Anchorage, Alaska in December to part icipate in her allergy desensitivity program. I have not needed to see any physician for allergies or short term memory loss since that time.

This study, the firs t of its kind in the world, covers amalgam removal, replacement and remo val again and silver-amalgam's effect on body blood chemistries. This research prove, beyond speculation, that chronic low level m ercurial poisoning from so-called silver dental fillings is the root c ause of many chronic diseases for which, until now, our physicians have had no explanation. 2.

It is a shocking example of how little we know about the true extent of vaccine-associat- ed injuries and deaths.\" The NVIC/DPT investigation was featured on the 2nd March 1994 NBC News \"Now with Tom Brokaw and Katie Couric\" show. A t the end of February 1994, NVIC/DPT also conducted a survey of 159 doctors' offices in seven states, including Arkansas, California, Ge orgia, Illinois, Maryland, New York, and Texas. When asked the question, \"In c ase of an adverse event after vaccination, does the doctor report it and, if yes, to whom?\" only 28 out of 159, or 18 percent said they make a repor t to the FDA, CDC or state health department. In New York, only one out of 40 doctors' offices confirmed that they report a death or injury follow ing vaccination. \"This shameful record of gross underreporting of ad verse events following vaccination by doctors around the country coupled with the shameful cover-up of vaccine-associated deaths and injuries by the feder- al government is an example of why more and more pa rents are losing faith in the mass vaccination system. Many times ou r organization must help parents report their children's vaccine-associ ated death or injury be- cause their doctor refuses to make a report,\" said Barbara Loe Fisher, NVIC/DPT Co-founder and President. \"Parents are leg ally required to vaccinate their children. Doctors should be forced to live up to their legal duty to report, and DHHS should be forced to live u p to its responsibility to seriously investigate every vaccine-associated d eath and injury and, especially, to identify and recall lots of DPT vacc ine associated with high numbers of deaths and injuries.\" In November 1991, while Fisher was a member of the National Vaccine Advisory Committee operated by the DHHS, she presen ted the Com- mittee with a detailed summary of the stories of 90 families who had reported vaccine-associated deaths and injuries to NVIC/DPT. Most of the 90 families with children or grandchildren who had suffered deaths and injuries following DPT vaccination, said that their doctors refused to make a vaccine adverse event report to the DHHS.

Dr. Leonard G. Horowitz During the 1960s and early 1970s the World Health O rganization func- tioned as the omnipotent supplier and standardizing authority of the world's experimental pharmaceuticals. In the field of virol ogy, the United States Public Health Service (USPHS) and National Institut es of Health (NIH) directed the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to bec ome, along with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) th e WHO's chief dis- tributor of viruses and antiviral vaccines. The WHO Chronicle noted by 1968—ten years into the WHO's viral research progra m—\"WHO virus reference centres\" had served as authorized technic al advisors and suppli- ers of \"prototype virus strains, diagnostic and ref erence reagents (e.g., antibodies), antigens, and cell cultures\" for more than \"120 laboratories in 35 different countries.\" Within a year of this anno uncement, this number increased to \"592 virus laboratories . . . [and] on ly 137 were outside Europe and North America.\" Over these 12 months, th e NCI and CDC helped the WHO distribute 2,514 strains of viruses, 1,888 ampoules of antisera mainly for reference purposes, 1,274 ampou les of antigens, and about 100 samples of cell cultures. More than 70,00 0 individual reports of virus isolations or related serological tests had b een transmitted through the WHO-NCI network. 12 At the NCI in Bethesda, Maryland, from the late 196 0s to the present, the chief retrovirus research laboratory was associ ated with the Depart- ment of Cell Tumor Biology, and chaired by Dr. Robe rt Gallo—an esteemed member of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) who was hailed by the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Se rvices Margaret Heckler in 1984 as the discoverer of the AIDS virus , HTLV-III. LAV, identical to HTLV-III had been isolated by Montagni er's French team and allegedly forwarded to Gallo in 1983. 3 "},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"56 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries MILITARY ORDERS FOR AIDS-LIKE VIRUSES: THE BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS CONTRACTORS As early as 1970, the U.S. Department of Defense (D OD) appropriated at least $10 million to \"initiate an adequate program through the National Academy of Sciences-National Research Council (NAS- NRC)\" to make a new infective microorganism which could differ in certain important aspects from any known disease-causing organisms. M ost important of these [aspects] is that it might be refractory to t he immunological and therapeutic processes upon which we depend to maint ain our relative free- dom from infectious disease. Members of the NAS-NRC had instructed scientific leaders in the DOD this work might be ac complished \"within 5 years.\" 4 This research was then carried out by American def ense contrac- tors despite the authorization and signing of the G eneva accord by Dr. Henry Kissinger and President Nixon outlawing the p roduction and test- ing of such biological weapons. 5 Also in 1970 Gallo and his co-workers presented res earch describing the experimental entry of bacterial ribonucleic aci d (RNA) into human white blood cells (WBCs) before a special symposium sponsored by NATO. 6 The paper published in the Proceedings of the Nati onal Academy of Sciences discussed several possible mechanisms p rompting the \"entry of foreign nucleic acids\" into lymphocytes—the cell s principally attacked by HIV. Prior to this, Gallo et al. had published s tudies identifying: 1. mechanisms responsible for reduced amino acid and p rotein synthesis by T-lymphocytes required for immunosuppression; 7 2. specific enzymes required to produce such effects a long with a \"base pair switch mutation\" in the genes of WBCs to creat e immune system dysfunction; 8 and 3. methods by which WBC \"DNA degradation\" and immune s ystem decay may be prompted by the \"pooling\" of purine ba ses and/or the addition of specific reagents. 9 Subsequent studies published in 1970 by Gallo and c o-workers identified \"RNA dependent DNA polymerase\" (i.e., the unique AI DS-linked enzyme, reverse transcriptase) responsible for \"gen e amplification . . . biochemical cytodifferentiation,\" (i.e., the develo pment of unique WBC characteristics including cancer cell production) a nd \"leukaemogene- sis\"; 10 and identified L-Asparaginase synthetase—a key enz yme that, if repressed, will induce treatment resistant leukemia s and other cancers. 11 The year following the $10 million appropriation by the DOD for AIDS-like biological weapons research, the NCI acqu ired the lion's share"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Alternative Medical Therapies 57 of the facilities at America's premier biological w eapons testing center, Fort Detrick in Frederick, Maryland. 12 Perhaps not coincidentally, the Cell Tumor Biology Laboratory's output increased in 1971 as measured by the publication of eight scientific articles by Gallo a nd co-workers compared to at most four in previous years. These reports in cluded Gallo's discov- ery that by adding a synthetic RNA and feline (i.e. , cat) leukemia virus (FELV) \"template\" to \"human type C\" viruses (associ ated with cancers of the lymph nodes), the rate of DNA production (and s ubsequent provirus synthesis) increased as much as thirty times. The N CI researchers report- ed that such a virus may cause many cancers besides leukemias and lym- phomas including sarcomas. 13 In this 1971 report Gallo et al. also reported modi fying simian (i.e., monkey) viruses by infusing them with cat leukemia RNA to make them cause cancers as seen in AIDS patients. 13 Furthermore, Fujioka and Gallo concluded from studi es conducted in late 1969 or early 1970 that they would need to fur ther \"evaluate the func- tional significance of tRNA changes in tumor cells, \" by designing an experiment in which \"specific tumor cell tRNAs\" wou ld be \"added direct- ly to normal cells.\" They explained that one way of doing this was to use viruses to deliver the foreign cancer producing tRN A to normal cells. The viruses which were then employed to do this, the re searchers noted, were the simian virus (SV40) and the mouse parotid tumor (polyoma) virus. 14 Such experiments clearly advanced immunodeficiency virus technolo- gy and even provided a model for the development of HIV, the AIDS virus—allegedly of simian virus descent—which simil arly delivered unique enzymes and a foreign RNA to normal cells ne cessary to cause an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome in animals and h umans. DEVELOPING MORE AIDS-LIKE VIRUSES In 1972, Gallo, his superiors and inferiors studied portions of simian viruses to determine differences in RNA activity be tween infected versus uninfected cancer cells, and whether the difference s could be ascribed to the infection and related DNA alterations. 15 They stated that \"by studying viral or cellular mutants or cell segregants . . . which have conditional variations in virus-specific cellular alterations, it should be possible to more precisely determine the biological significanc e of the RNA variation reported here.\" Clearly, the group was working to determine the rel evance of various viral genes on the development of human cancers and immune system col- lapse. They reported their desire to use this infor mation to find a cure for cancer, but at this time their activity was more fo cused on creating various cancers as well as new carcinogenic viruses which c ould infect humans."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"58 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries For example, Smith and Gallo published another Nati onal Academy of Sciences paper examining DNA polymerase (i.e., reve rse transcriptase) activity in immature normal versus acute leukemic l ymph cells. To do so, they evaluated the single stranded 70S RNA retrovir us found in chickens which causes prominent features of AIDS including W BC dysfunction, sarcomas, progressive wasting and death. 16 Borrow, Smith and Gallo injected this chicken virus RNA into human WBCs to determine if the cells were prompted to produce proteins (including new viruses) encoded by the viral RNA. 17 Robert, Smith and Gallo also evaluated the neoplas - tic effects of single stranded 70S RNA reverse tran scriptase delivered by the cat leukemia virus (FELV) and the mason-Pfizer monkey virus on nor- mal human lymphocytes (NHL). 18 This work foreshadowed the observation made ten yea rs later by the CDC's chief AIDS researcher, Dr. Donald Francis who noted the \"laundry list\" of feline leukemia-like diseases associated w ith AIDS. 3 Other examples are detailed by Gallo and co-workers while discussing their adapting monkey, rat, and bird leukemia and t umor viruses for exper- imental use in a human (NC-37) cell line. 19 Wu, Ting and Gallo 20 dis- cussed the synthesis of new RNA tumor viruses \"indu ced by 5-iodo-2'- deoxyuridine, IdU (a constituent of RNA) in rodent cell cultures, and noted that chemotherapy might be used to halt the r everse transcriptase- linked viral reproduction. However, had HIV been synthesized for military purp oses from various species components, it would be difficult, if not i mpossible, to prove. As Gillespie, Gillespie and Gallo et al. noted in 1973 concerning the origin of the RD114—another cat/human bioengineered virus—\"it can always be argued that\" a virus which naturally jumped species (as HIV is alleged to have done from the monkey) would be expected to hav e antigens that dif- fer \"from the antigen found on the viruses of known \" origin. 21 LITTON BIONETICS: GALLO'S LINK TO THE DOD Four years later, during a U.S. Senate investigatio n of illegal \"biological testing involving human subjects by the Department of Defense,\" Senators learned that Bionetics, Bionetics Research Laboratories, and Litton Bionetics—an organization which, along with the NCI, adminis- tered and provided Dr. Gallo's research funding 10,13,15,17-19,22,26 were not only acknowledged DOD biological weapons contractor s, but their affili- ated Litton Systems, Inc., was among the most frequ ently contracted insti- tutions involved in biological weapons research and development between 1960 and 1970 (the end of the reported peri od). 23 Additional bio- logical weapons contractors with whom Dr. Gallo and /or his co-workers associated during the late 1960s and early 1970s in cluded the University of"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Alternative Medical Therapies 59 Chicago, 24 Texas, 13 Virginia, 25 and Yale, 17 Merck and Co.

This shipment was likely to hav e started the first hem- morhagic fever \"Marburg virus\" outbreak among Europ ean vaccine labo- ratory workers in 1967. As noted by the world's lea ding simian virus expert at the time, Dr. Seymour Kalter, the Marburg virus was apparently manmade. 23-25 In fact, Litton Bionetics, the chief military and i ndustrial supplier of pri- mates for cancer virus experimentation during the 1 960s and early 1970s, also maintained the colony of the specific genus of monkeys associated with all of the major monkey AIDS virus outbreaks i n the United States. 23 Through telephone interviews with Litton Bionetics and MedPath administrators, I learned that Bionetics Research L aboratories had been sold to MedPath Corporation—one of America's larges t medical and blood testing laboratories—a division of Dow Cornin g. Dow Coming's parent, Dow Chemical Company, was also listed among the Army's chief biological weapons contractors during the 1960s and early 1970s. 26,27 Litton Bionetics, a subsidiary of Litton Industries , Inc. remains in busi- ness as a proprietor of the Frederick Cancer Resear ch Center, a \"private- ly owned, government contracted\" facility.

On April 4, 1977, Mobutu suspended diplomatic relat ions with Cuba; on April 21, reduced ties with the Soviet Union; and o n May 2, he cut ties with East Germany. 46 Meanwhile, according to John Stockwell, Former Chi ef of the CIA's Angola Task Force, \"the United States was exposed, dishonored and discredited in the eyes of the world,\" as \"15,0 00 Cubans were installed in Angola\" 40 despite the CIA's best efforts and a continuing po licy of lying \"to State Department officials, Congressmen, Americ an press, and world public opinion in varying degrees, depending on the need\" about the CIA's covert military campaign in Angola and Zaire. 39 Throughout 1976 and 1977, Mobutu, NATO, and the CIA , constrained by the Tunney, Cranston and Clark amendment which p revented the expenditure of American funds in Zaire/Angola, exce pt to gather intelli- gence, 39 remained embroiled in the \"Shaba rebellion\" agains t allegedly Russian-backed \"Katangan rebels.\" 46 At the same time, perhaps not coincidentally, NATO ally West Germany was pouring financial aid into Zaire and white rule d South Africa. 47-49 The Northeast region of Zaire, believed to be the epice nter of the AIDS epi- demic, was specifically targetted for West German e conomic aid and industrialization. 50 The \"long tradition of friendship between Germans a nd South Africans\" London's African Development noted, \"date s back from the first waves of white immigrants to South Africa and the feeling of soli- darity between Germans and Afrikaners during the Bo er War, continuing throughout the First World War and then the Second World War.

But actually it is not Soviet scientists at all who first came up with this theory,\" Belitskiy repo rted. \"It was first reported in Western journals by Western scientists, such as Dr. John Seale, a specialist on venereal diseases at two big London hospitals. \"Just recently a Soviet journalist in Algeria, Alek sandr Zhukov, man- aged to interview a European physician at the Moust apha Hospital there, who made some relevant disclosures on the subject. In the early seventies, this physician, an immunologist, was working for th e West German OTRAG Corporation in Zaire. His laboratory had been given the assign- ment to cultivate viruses ordinarily affecting anim als but constituting a potential danger to man. They were particularly int erested in certain un- known viruses isolated from the African green monke y, and capable of such rapid replication that they could completely d estabilize the immune system. These viruses, however, were quite harmless for human beings and the lab's assignment was to develop a mutant vi rus that would be a human killer.\" 7-11,13-22 \"Did they succeed?\" the announcer asked. \"To a larg e extent, yes,\" Belitskiy replied. \"The lab was ordered to wind up the project and turn the results over to certain U.S. researchers, who had b een following this work with keen interest, to such an extent that some of the researchers believed they were in reality working not for the West Germa n OTRAG Corp- oration but for the Pentagon.\" 59 Two years after Belitskiy's announcement, in 1991, Dr. Jacobo Segal, professor emeritus of Berlin's Humboldt University told the international press that the Pentagon theory of AIDS made sense. He alleged the virus was likely developed \"through gene technology\" as a result of Pentagon sponsored animal research, \"to permit the attack on human immune cells.\" Furthermore, he reported this theory is \"supported by many European sci- entists and has not been refuted.\" 60 In 1977, at the height of OTRAG's Zairian missile t esting phase, Litton Industries units received contracts worth: $5 milli on for medical electron- ic equipment from its Hellige division, in Freiburg , West Germany; 61 $19.8 million worth of missile fire-control equipme nt from the Army; 62 $32.9 million for electronic reconnaissance sensor equipment from the Air Force; 63 and in 1978 $11.3 million worth of computerized co mmunica- tions systems for NATO. 64 Some of these military supplies may have been earmarked for OTRAG. 65 Moreover, given the \"cooperation between NATO and t he World Health OrganizatiOD with regard to the control and regulat ion of the international exchange of pharmaceutical products, [and] the poss ible necessity of facing"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"64 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries the dangers created by the use of chemical or bacte riological weapons\" 66 it appears noteworthy that the outbreaks of the world' s most feared and dead- ly viruses Marburg, Ebola, Reston, and AIDS—share t he dubious distinc- tion of breaking out in or around zones of U.S. and West German, NATO- allied, military experimentation at the height of t he cold war; increased political/military interest in Central Africa, and a burgeoning of WHO and NCI contracts for the supply of simians for \"defens ive\" research. 44 AIDS, GAYS, BLACKS AND THE CIA It is also noteworthy that in 1975, five years foll owing the signing of the Geneva accord by Nixon, congressional records revea led that the USPHS through the Special (i.e., covert) Operations Divis ion of the Army contin- ued to supply biological weapons including deadly n eurotoxins and virus- es to the CIA which illegally stored them in their Fort Detrick facility for future unsanctioned uses. 67 Though records of who initiated and directed this covert activity were destroyed by the CIA, alo ng with the famous Watergate tapes, 68 Mr. Nathan Gordon, Former Chief of the CIA's Chemistry Branch, Technical Services Division confe ssed knowledge that some of the stored substances were to be used to \"s tudy immunization methods for diseases vis-a-vis—who knows, cancer.\" 69 Furthermore, fol- lowing Nixon's resignation, President Ford and Henr y Kissinger were made aware that the CIA maintained a residual suppl y of biological weapons, but neither ordered their destruction acco rding to testimony pro- vided by Former CIA Director Richard Helms. 70 In subsequent congressional hearings before the Sen ate Subcommittee on Health and Scientific Research, it was revealed that George W Merck, \"of the prominent Merck pharmaceutical firm,\" direc ted America's bio- logical weapons manufacturing industry for decades following World War II. 71 Merck & Company, Inc. was also listed among the DO D biological weapons contractors. 72 Merck, Sharp and Dohme provided major finan- cial support for the earliest hepatitis B vaccinati on studies conducted simultaneously in Central Africa and New York City during the early 1970s.

For example, the myxo- ma virus causes little problem in the South America n forest rabbit, its longstanding host, but it was devastating when intr oduced among European rabbits in Australia. As the virus rampage s through the new species, susceptible individuals are killed, wherea s the resistant ones sur- vive and reproduce, and eventually virulence declin es, as in the case of myxomatosis in Australia. 1 Thus, when a new viral disease springs unannounced on humans, one possible suspect is animal viruses. In the case of AIDS, this soon became the most favored explanation among scientists. In 1 983, Luc Montagnier and his colleagues reported isolation of a virus, l ater called human im- munodeficiency virus or HIV, linked to AIDS. Two ye ars later, a type of virus very similar to HIV was found in African monk eys. It was called simian immunodeficiency virus or SIV. Many SIVs cau se no obvious dis- ease in their host species, though they can be viru lent if transmitted to a different, unaffected monkey species. The obvious e xplanation for AIDS was that SIV somehow was transmitted to humans, whe re it became or evolved into HIV. The next question was how the SIV might have been t ransmitted from simians to humans. Before looking at the possible e xplanations, it is worth mentioning some other evidence. First, there are tw o major types of HIV, called HIV-1 and HIV-2. HIV-1 is the type found thr oughout most of the world; HIV-2 is found mostly in western Africa. Brian Martin is a professor at the University of Wo llongong, NSW, Australia. 73"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"74 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries There are also different SIVs, and in fact new ones continue to be dis- covered. There is one known SIV that is very simila r to HIV-2, but none yet proven to be highly similar to HIV-1. HIV, like any virus, has a genetic structure. Even within one type of HIV, such as HIV-1, there are many variations. In other words, the genetic struc- ture is pretty much the same, but there are slight variations. The variations are due to mutations and selection as the virus spr eads. By examining the spread of variants and working backwards, it is pos sible to estimate when HIV-l first entered the human species. The usual es timate is just before 1960. The other relevant information is evidence of AIDS in humans. One of the earliest known cases has been traced to Kinshas a in Africa in the late 1950s. The implication is that SIV entered humans i n central Africa in or by the late 1950s and thereafter spread to other pa rts of the world. But how did SIV enter humans? This is of more than intellectual inter- est. Knowing the process may help to prevent recurr ences and to provide clues for developing a cure. It is known that HIV does not survive easily outsid e the body and that the most effective means of transmission are via bl ood or mucosa. One explanation is that a hunter, in butchering a monke y, allowed monkey blood to enter a cut. Others are that a human ate s ome undercooked mon- key meat, that monkey blood was injected into human s as part of certain sexual customs, and that a monkey bit a human. An explanation along these lines is the standard vi ew on the origin of AIDS. But there is one obvious question. Why did AI DS develop in the 1950s? A cut hunter or monkey bite could have occur red any time in the past thousands of years. The usual explanation is t hat urbanization and travel led to the wider spread of AIDS beginning in the 1950s. There is, though, another theory available, that ex plains both the trans- mission and the timing: polio vaccination campaigns in central Africa in the late 1950s. This theory is simple and obvious. Polio vaccines are cul- tured on monkey kidneys. Many of the monkeys would have been carry- ing SIVs, and many of them would have shown no symp toms and thus not been rejected as ill. Thus it would not be too diff icult for some batches of vaccine to be contaminated with SIVs. Since the SIV s were not discov- ered until 1985, there was no way to screen for the m in the 1950s. There is even a precedent for monkey-human viral tr ansmission. In the early 1960s, some polio vaccines were found to be c ontaminated with a simian virus named SV40. This caused great concern at the time, since SV40 had been given to tens of millions of people i n the United States and elsewhere. Henceforth, steps were taken to screen a ll vaccines for SV40 and other such viruses. (The health consequences of SV40 in humans is a separate issue that deserves study.)"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Alternative Medical Therapies 75 So here was a theory waiting to be developed and te sted. Polio vaccines were already known to have led to the spread of sim ian viruses to humans. Monkeys with SIVs were almost certainly used in pol io vaccine prepara- tion, and there was no screening for the SIVs. Fina lly, some of the earli- est known cases of AIDS were near to the time and l ocation of major polio vaccination campaigns in Africa in the late 1950s. But this theory was not investigated by the medical research establish- ment. There is one obvious reason for this: the the ory, if accepted as true, would be extremely damaging to the image of medical science. The theo- ry might have been talked about but not seriously s tudied, as indicated by a report early in 1992 \"A senior AIDS researcher sa id it has been an open secret to many AIDS researchers for at least four y ears that polio vaccines might have been contaminated by HIV or a related re trovirus,\" but no test- ing of vaccine stocks had occurred because, accordi ng to this researcher, \"Everybody was afraid there would be a public panic or a scandal.\" 2 PASCAL'S STUDIES If the medical research establishment was reluctant to investigate the the- ory, others were not. One of them was Louis Pascal, an independent schol- ar in New York City. In 1987, he heard a radio talk show with guest Eva Lee Snead who proposed that polio vaccine contamina ted with SV40 was responsible for AIDS. Pascal knew enough biology to realize that SV40 couldn't be the cause, but what about the SIVs? He decided to investigate. By reading medical journals from the 1950s and 1960 s and making comparisons with recent reports about the developme nt of AIDS, Pascal soon had a powerful set of arguments suggesting tha t polio vaccination campaigns in Africa may have led to AIDS. He focuse d on a particular batch of vaccine used by Hilary Koprowski, a pionee r in polio eradication but less well known than Jonas Salk and Albert Sabi n. Koprowski's CHAT Type 1 polio vaccine was given to some 325,000 men, women and children in central and west Africa from 1957 to 19 60, plus a few thou- sand people elsewhere, such as Poland. Pascal found a remarkable geo- graphical coincidence. The main use of CHAT was in central Africa, not far from the area of Africa with one of the highest incidences of AIDS in the world today. Significant doses of CHAT were als o administered in the city of Leopoldville; today that city, now called K inshasa, has an extreme- ly high incidence of AIDS. Sabin later found this b atch of vaccine to be contaminated by an unidentified virus. Koprowski's vaccine was administered orally, by spr aying a mist of vaccine into a person's mouth. This seems to raise an immediate objec- tion: HIV, some later critics said, has not been sh own to be transmitted orally, so it is u n l i k e l y that SIV could be transmi tted to humans this way."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"76 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries Pascal has two responses. First, HIV can be transmi tted orally, most clear- ly from breast-feeding mothers to their children. A ll that is required is that the mucus [membranes] in a recipient's mouth have r educed immune response. Second, it is quite possible that some of the recipients of the vaccine had ulcers or cuts in their mouths, allowin g SIV to enter the bloodstream. Pascal's main interest was to track the origin of H IV-1. He attributes it to an undiscovered SIV that infected a small number of people in central Africa via Koprowski's CHAT vaccine, followed by th e spread of HIV-1 elsewhere via person-to-person contact. Pascal had one further argument. He notes that the immune system nor- mally resists alien cells, or indeed any biological material with an unfamil- iar genetic sequence. This of course is why it is n ecessary to suppress the immune system when transplanting organs. Pascal ask s rhetorically, how better to spread a virus from one species to anothe r than by giving it to large numbers of individuals, some of whom are likely to have impaired immune systems? He then points out that Koprowski's vaccin e was given to large numbers of children, some of whom were less than 30 days old. Not only are young children's immune systems undeveloped; th e youngest children were given 15 times the adult dosage of polio vacci ne. Pascal found much else in his search through the me dical literature, enough to convince him that this theory was worth t esting because of its serious implications. One immediate implication is that vaccines should not be cultured on monkey kidneys. There are a numb er of different SIVs and new ones continue to be discovered. Pascal spec ulated that a new SIV might be entering the human species every few years , potentially leading to a new type of HIV and causing the death of a mil lion or more additional people. Because different HIVs have different rates of exponential spread, one or two types will usually dominate infection st atistics. Nevertheless, the human consequences of a single further new HIV are considerable. Therefore, Pascal thought his theory deserved urgen t consideration. After all, a delay of a few years might conceivably lead to the deaths of millions of people. Another implication of Pascal's theory is the need for an urgent assess- ment of other possible methods for spreading diseas e from one species to another. One example is the recently carried-out tr ansplantation of a baboon liver into a human. This provides an ideal o pportunity for the spread of any virus in the baboon to the human, giv en the mixing of cells and blood and the use of drugs to suppress the reci pient's immune system. Another example is some of the experiments with gen etic engineering. Pascal had a theory and had good reason to believe it deserved urgent consideration. If the theory could be proved wrong, then there was noth-"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Alternative Medical Therapies 77 ing to worry about; but if it proved correct (or po ssibly correct) then its implications should be dealt with immediately. He a ssumed that since the theory seemed so obvious, there would be others who would come up with it independently. But, just in case, he did wh at he could to make sure it received critical examination. Pascal believed that if he wrote up his findings an d sent them to scien- tists and to scientific journals, then—taking into account the important potential social implications of the theory—scienti sts would either refute his ideas or accept them. In other words, he expect ed his ideas to be con- sidered objectively, irrespective of who he was or how he wrote up his material. Proceeding on this assumption, Pascal wro te an account of his theory, including plenty of references and logical argumentation so that others could check his facts and inferences. He sen t his paper to a number of prominent scientists for their examination and a lso submitted it to a number of leading scientific journals. From the prominent scientists, Pascal received only one cursory ac- knowledgment. From the scientific journals—Nature, Lancet, and New Scientist—he received the brushoff, either a reject ion with little or no explanation, or year-long failures to answer. Pascal thought that scientists and scientific journ als would give his ideas a fair hearing. Unfortunately, the standard v iew that science is objec- tive and open to new ideas—a view that is taught to science students in high school and university and to the general publi c through many popu- lar treatments—is flawed. The reality is that being taken seriously by the scientific research establishment depends sensitive ly on who the writer is, what their institutional affiliation is, how they w rite their paper and, not least, what they have to say. To be taken seriously , it is a great advantage to be an eminent scientist, to write from a prestig ious address, to write precisely in the standard journal style, and to say something that is just marginally original and not threatening to any powe rful interest group. Pascal, by being an \"independent scholar\" with no i nstitutional affiliation, by writing in a style that deviated somewhat from t he standard passionless prose and not citing prominent scientists in quite the appropriate respectful way, and by presenting a highly threatening proposa l, was never taken seriously. Defenders of the system would say that Pascal shoul d have couched his ideas in the standard format. If he wanted to be ta ken seriously, he had to play the game of scientific publication by the rule s. From Pascal's point of view, this sort of attitude misses the point. It was he who was raising a serious issue for science and public health. He fel t it was the responsibil- ity of editors to deal with his concerns promptly a nd effectively. If he was wrong, nothing was lost; if he was right, many migh t suffer. Therefore the"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"78 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries \"scientific reception system,\" namely the system by which potential con- tributions to scientific knowledge are considered, certified, and published, was responsible for making sure his ideas received proper consideration, even if he didn't couch them precisely in orthodox form. Cynically speaking, the system works reasonably wel l to serve the in- terests of career scientists, who have a strong inc entive to play the game by the rules, since that is the way they obtain pub lication and thereby obtain jobs, grants, and promotions. But Pascal was not seeking a career in science, nor did he particularly care about havi ng his name in print. He was primarily concerned about scientific ideas and the social implications of science. This lack of career motive and personal ambition can seem strange to professional scientists. Likewise the op eration of the scientific reception system seems strange, indeed immoral, to someone like Pascal with different motivations and goals. One of his correspondents, a philosopher, sent Pasc al's paper to the Journal of Medical Ethics, whose editor then invite d Pascal to submit a paper on the ethical issues associated with his cas e. After much labor, Pascal prepared a new paper, but it was rejected .. . for being too long. In 1990 I began corresponding with Pascal and was q uite impressed by his ideas, his grasp of the issues, and his thoroug hness. After his paper was rejected by the Journal of Medical Ethics, I arrang ed for it to be published in a working paper series at my university. 3 As soon as it began to be cir- culated, it generated considerable interest among s cientists and others. One of the responses was by the editor of the Journ al of Medical Ethics, who wrote an editorial explaining why they had reje cted it, making known its availability and commenting that Pascal's thesi s \"is an important and thoroughly argued one and ought to be taken serious ly by workers in the AIDS field.\" 4 OTHER INVESTIGATORS Pascal had long said that he would not be surprised if others indepen- dently developed the same theory, since it was so o bvious. As indicated by the quote from the AIDS researchers, it had indeed been considered, but apparently not investigated further because of rese rvations about the pos- sible implications. Most of the scientific communit y remained ignorant of the theory, aided by unreceptive journals. One exception was two South African scientists, Pro fessors Gerasimos Lecatsas and Jennifer J. Alexander. Independently o f Pascal, they wrote several letters and short pieces to scientific jour nals raising the possibili- ty of AIDS arising from polio vaccines. Most of the ir early submissions were rejected, but not all. 5 However, this airing of the idea in a medical journal did not stimulate others to investigate mor e deeply. Instead, they"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Alternative Medical Therapies 79 were personally attacked in a reply to their letter in the South African Medical Journal. Blaine Elswood, an AIDS activist and employee of th e University of California at San Francisco, also developed the sam e theory independently of Pascal. Elswood worked with medical researcher R aphael Stricker and they prepared a carefully written scientific paper. It was rejected by the British Medical Journal. They next tried Research i n Virology. After being given strong encouragement by Luc Montagnier, month s passed. Then, in an apparent reversal, they were asked to shorten th e paper, delete most of a section on SV40, and resubmit their material as a l etter to the editor. Many more months passed before their letter was finally published. 6 It was fol- lowed by a rebuttal from the editorial board of the journal. Clearly the mainstream scientific journals were not eager to give the the- ory much visibility. Elswood had anticipated this, and he had encouraged Tom Curtis, a free-lance journalist based in Housto n, to investigate. Curtis was enthusiastic. Starting with materials obtained from Elswood, he delved further into the literature and also did interviews with many scientists, including Sabin, Salk, and Koprowski. He wrote a se ries of important sto- ries in the Houston Post and a major piece publishe d in Rolling Stone. 1 Whereas the scientific journals had stalled on the story for years, Curtis' Rolling Stone story broke through the usual barriers. It became a news item not only in the press, radio and televisi on, but also a story in the news columns of scientific journals. 8 Koprowski wrote a response in the form of a letter to the editor of Science. 9 Curtis wrote a reply, but Science refused to publi sh it. The Wistar Institute, headed by Koprowski until 199 1, holds seed stocks of polio vaccines. Koprowski had earlier bee n asked by medical researcher Robert Bohannon to release its vaccines for testing. If vaccines from the 1950s African campaigns were found to be c ontaminated by SIVs, this would provide support for the polio vacc ine-AIDS theory. But Koprowski failed at first to even answer Bohann on's letters. Bohannon also had little success with similar reque sts to the Food and Drug Administration. Curtis' story in Rolling Stone made it harder for W istar to refuse to cooperate. The Institute set up an independent advi sory committee to advise it concerning the implications of the theory . The committee pro- vided a brief 8-page typed report which concluded t hat the chance that AIDS had originated from polio vaccination campaign s was \"extremely low.\" 10 Unfortunately the committee never consulted Pascal, Elswood or Curtis in preparing its report. Even if, a priori, the cha nce of causing AIDS from polio vaccines was quite low, we know now that AIDS did develop some-"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"80 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries how. Therefore, the key issue is not the absolute p robability of AIDS developing from a particular sequence of events, bu t the relative proba- bility, namely the probability compared to other wa ys that AIDS might have developed (cut hunters, monkey bites, and so f orth). But the Wistar committee made no such comparisons. The only bit of real evidence that the committee us ed to criticize the theory was the case of a Manchester seaman who died in 1959, in retro- spect apparently having contracted AIDS. HIV was de tected postmortem. Koprowski, in the letter to Science, also made a bi g issue of the Manchester seaman. Yet there are several possible explanations for this case which reduce its power as an objection to the theory. First, the test for HIV in the seaman's remains may have been a false positive. In other words, the seaman may not have h ad AIDS at all, but instead the tests that showed HIV may have been con taminated. Aptly, the first four pages of Pascal's paper deal with how ea sy it is for cell lines to be contaminated, drawing on the famous case of HeLa . 11 (See the inset \"The HeLa Affair\" on page 81.) Pascal uses the exam ple to show how easy it is for scientists to slip up and how eager they are to avoid acknowl- edging their mistakes. Second, the seaman might have been infected by HIV during a trip to Africa or by contact with other seamen, and then ha ve developed AIDS much more rapidly than usual, especially considerin g that he was given immune-suppressive drugs. Third, the seaman might have contracted AIDS via so me earlier vac- cine experiments from the 1920s to the 1950s, at le ast one of which involved the injection of live monkey cells into th ousands of people.' 2 Pascal points out that there is evidence of experim ents involving grafts of monkey or chimpanzee organs at least as early as 19 16. 13 It is possible that monkey viruses could have been transmitted to human s on one or more of these earlier occasions, leading to anomalous cases of disease. This is compatible with polio vaccination campaigns in Afri ca being the cause of the AIDS pandemic. It is now the conventional wisdom in the history an d sociology of science that a single piece of evidence is not sufficient t o reject a theory. Within any general picture, such as a scientific paradigm, the re are always some anom- alies. These anomalies are either explained away or ignored so long as there are compensating advantages or insights to be gaine d from the wider pic- ture. This is not to say that anomalies should be d ismissed as trivial. Quite the contrary. But they are not alone sufficient bas is to reject a theory.

The HeLa affair begin in 1951, when the first human cells were grown in long term tissue culture. The HeLa ce lls were cervical cancer cells taken from a woman named Henr ietta Lacks. Although Henrietta Lacks died of her disease , the cells from her tumor—given the shortened name HeLa—not on ly survived, but flourished. Because her cells were so strong, they were sent to various other laboratories around the country and from ther e around the world for experimental purposes. Unfortunately, lab oratory errors allowed HeLa cells to contaminate other tiss ue cultures, and the HeLa cells quickly overtook and replaced th e other cells. However, much of the time, the colonization of othe r tissue cultures by HeLa cells went unnoticed, since the ap pearance of many tissue cultures is highly similar. Thus, sc ientists who believed that they were studying cells from human b reast tumors or monkey heart cells, for example, were in many cases studying HeLa cells. To add to the problem of the spread of HeLa cells, many researchers would share their particularly hardy li ne of \"breast tumor\" or \"monkey heart\" cells with their colleague s. It took only a few years for the problems of HeLa contamination of other cell lines to have reached crisis proportions. An i nvestigation by geneticist Stanley Gartler found that of sevente en tissue cultures—obtained from a number of different labora tories—all were HeLa cell cultures, contrary to their official designation as a variety of human cell lines. The problem of HeLa contamination of tissue culture s was finally tackled by Walter Nelson Rees, who was then the head of a cell bank at the University of California. Nelson Rees also held the position of vice president for the Tissue Cultu re Association —the profesional body to which scientists involved in tissue culture work belonged. When he confirmed Stanley Ga rtler's findings, Nelson Rees submitted long lists of conta minated cell lines to journals. However, instead of promptly pub lishing these important documents, many journals procrastinated w hile still others refused to publish Nelson Rees's lists at al l."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"82 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries The Journal of the National Cancer Institute publis hed what independent researcher Louis Pascal described as a \"cooked- up\" case by workers previously discredited by Nelso n Rees, using \"illegitimate photographs of chromosomes\" and \"shoddy logic\" to try and prove that the charges of contami nation were not valid. One major supplier of biolgical supplies, Microbiol ogical Associates—later M.A. Bioproducts—reportedly contin ued to sell a HeLa contaminated culture for thirteen years after the company was first informed by Stanley Gartler that it was contaminated—and seven years after other scientists had confirmed the contamination. Nelson Rees's campaign against the contamination of tissue cultures made him so many enemies that he wa s forced to retire in 1981, aged just 52.

Curtis' intervie ws revealed the extreme hostility with which Koprowski, Salk, and Sabin res ponded to the theory. This is not surprising, considering the strong emot ional investment that leading scientists have in their own ideas. 14 There are of course many other arguments concerning the theory, rang- ing from the problems of gene sequences, the specie s of monkeys used in polio vaccine trials, the spread of AIDS in other c ountries, and much more. The aim here is not to address these complexities b ut to outline the theo- ry and point out the failure of the mainstream scie ntific community to confront it adequately. This failure has an intriguing self-righteous twist . Many scientists look down upon the mass media and consider that science is only proper when it takes place in professional forums. Koprowski, f or example, said that \"as a scientist, I did not intend to debate Tom Cur tis when he presented his hypothesis about the origin of AIDS in Rolling Stone.\" 15 He did con- descend to reply after a letter by Curtis appeared in Science. In another example, Luc Montagnier supported the decision of R esearch in Virology to request Elswood and Stricker to shorten their pa per to a letter to the edi- tor by referring to the \"extensive publication\" of their views in the lay press.\" 16 This seems rather unfair, since the reason the stor y obtained attention"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Alternative Medical Therapies 83 in the \"lay press\" first is that scientists, knowin g about the theory for some years, declined to investigate it and editors refus ed to publish submissions to scientific journals. In other words, the relevan t scientific community failed to come to grips with a theory that deserved critical attention, even if only to refute it. Then, when individuals outsid e the scientific main- stream worked on the theory and obtained media cove rage, their approach was denigrated. Nevertheless, some inroads into mainstream practice may yet occur. The Wistar committee, in spite of its assessment of the polio vaccine- AIDS theory as highly unlikely, have recommended th at polio vaccine no longer be cultured using monkey kidneys,* because \" There may well be other monkey viruses that have not yet been discove red that could possi- bly contaminate vaccine lots.\" 17 This was exactly the thing that Pascal has been warning about for years. It took an article in Rolling Stone for sci- entists to take it seriously. The implications are wider than just polio vaccines . All transfers of material from one species to another should be scru tinized. For example, it has recently been found that many cattle in the United States are infect- ed by bovine immunodeficiency-like virus or BIV, wh ich has a genetic structure similar to HIV. This is not a scientific curiosity, Pascal points out, because bovine hemoglobin is being used to manufact ure substitutes for human hemoglobin. The danger of introducing new dis eases to humans may be low, but at the very least it should be investig ated. Thus, even if the theory is wrong, it may be valuab le in leading to dis- coveries or revised practices that will advance the understanding of AIDS, how to deal with it, or how to prevent similar dise ases. That is the most that can be asked of any scientific theory. I want to thank Tom Curtis, Blaine Elswood, and Lou is Pascal for valu- able comments on earlier drafts of this paper. Editor's Note: In December 1992, Mr. Koprowski sued Tom Curtis and Rolling Stone magazine for defamation. This effecti vely quashed further investigation into the story by mainstream media. B rian Martin publicised the lawsuit through the Sci-Tech Studies electronic mailing list, and also wrote a letter to Nature about the dangers of allow ing legal action to stymie scientific debate. This seemed to stimulate renewed interest in the theory within the scientific community. Finally, in November 1993, just before Mr. Koprowski was to undergo deposition, his lawyers settled out * As of January, 1998, a spokesperson fo r the New Z ealand Ministry of Health confirmed that at least some of the polio vaccine used in New Zeal and is still grown on monkey kidney tissue.

It's so simple it befuddles the great minds. Unlike our healthy human cells that love oxygen, most of the primitive bacteria an d viruses, including HIV and others found in cancer, AIDS, Ebola, flesh eating bacteria, chron- ic fatigue, tuberculosis, arthritis, and a long lis t of other diseases are like most lower life from viruses and bacteria that can' t stand oxygen. Bacteria and viruses are almost all anaerobic. \"Anaerobic\" m eans these microbes cannot live in oxygen What would happen to the primitive anaerobic viruse s and bacteria that cause disease if they were to be completely surroun ded with a very ener- getic form of pure oxygen for a long time? What if enough of this special form of oxygen (O 2 ), or its higher medical grade form called \"ozone\" (O 3 ), were to be slowly and harmlessly introduced dire ctly into the body day after day, every day, over the course of severa l months, by high con- centration methods that usually bypass the lungs, a nd yet saturate every body cell with oxygen? All the disease-related, or disease-causing, bugs and microbes that can't live in oxygen also can't l ive in oxygen saturated body tissues and fluids. See how simple it is? It's amazing you were never told this. What would happen to any HIV in your body if it was caused to be con- tinually surrounded with oxygen, or its higher form , ozone? See the October 11, 1991 issue of The Journal of the Americ an Society of Hematology, \"Inactivation of HIV type 1 by Ozone in vitro\" (page 1881): \"Ozone, a higher form of oxygen, inactivates the HI V virus 97-100 per- cent of the time, and is harmless to normal cells, when used correctly.\" What currently over-hyped and over-prescribed AIDS drug can make any- where near these claims for effectiveness and safet y?

Typically, his live r had been destroyed before he arrived. Now he is willing to look at alt ernatives (if they would only look sooner) but, unfortunately, denial, and l etting someone else be responsible for your own personal well being, is st rongly ingrained in our society. Ozone is unknown in this country by you or your doctor due to the influence the drug companies wield over our hea lthcare system and the media. They are not your friend. Ozone is. In t he Greek ozone trans- lates into \"the Breath of God.\" Millions of dosages of ozone have been given in Europe by thousands of doctors over the pa st fifty years with complete safety. Why isn't its use taught in medical schools here in the United States? All fifty or so oxygen therapies have the same meth od of action. The point in oxygen therapies is always to slowly and i ncreasingly flood the body with Nature's single oxygen atoms. Singlet oxy gen and its by-products are very energetic oxidizers—they \"burn up\" or oxid ize disease-causing waste products, toxins and other pollution, and sen d them out of the body. Unless your body rids itself of toxins at 100 perce nt efficiency, some waste is left behind, still in the body. Over time it acc umulates within you, setting the stage for diseases to occur as the inner pollut ion accumulates. This is why you get more and more diseases as you get older . This is the cause of virtually all disease. It is very important. Rememb er this as the viral plagues get worse, and the air becomes less and less able t o sustain us. Your body no longer naturally has or gets enough clean energe tic oxygen. Your body can no longer take out the trash that causes diseas e. As an example of how dirty we have become internall y, I have wit- nessed hundreds of AIDS, cancer, arthritis, and oth er patients getting oxy- gen/ozone therapy. When they start out their blood is filthy, diseased, and so empty of oxygen that it is almost BLACK. Put the medical oxygen/ ozone in them daily, and after a few weeks of oxidi zing/oxygenating detoxification their blood starts to turn a bright cherry RED, clean and full of LIFE. Oxygen atoms also burn up germs (microbes) which ca n't protect themselves against its oxidizing powers. Unlike evo lved and specialized normal human cells, germs, microbes, and all parasi tes are primitive lower life forms. Normal body cells protect themsel ves from the burning up or oxidizing effects of oxygen by naturally prod ucing and using their own protective antioxidant coatings. Our normal cel ls surround them- selves with this insulating and protective coating that primitive disease- related bugs, germs, and even cancer cells do not h ave. Seeking out any- thing that is not a normal healthy human cell to ox idize, oxygen is a nat- ural hunter, the killer enemy of bacteria and virus es and also dead, dying, deformed, or diseased cells l i k e those found in can cers."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"88 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries Naturally, oxygen therapies are best used as supple mental maintenance dose-type preventatives. By keeping the oxygen leve l high in our body fluids, we keep the anaerobic diseases from ever be ing able to establish themselves. If they can't live in oxygen, they won' t live in highly oxy- genated clean tissues. If one uses these therapies correctly and long term, one's internal fluids would be oxygen rich. Most ox ygenated people I know personally don't even catch colds anymore. When oxygen therapies are employed as a method of p utting the patient back on the road to health, they have completely pr oven themselves, according to the thousands of interviews I have con ducted with the actu- al users of these therapies. In addition, the world 's medical literature is replete with the proof of oxygen/ozone therapies' b eing both inexpensive and highly effective, and they have been proven ver y safe and natural when used as directed.

We are internal ly permeated with fluids, and our organs are mostly water and float i n our internal sea. In medicine, oxygen/ozone gas is slowly micro-bubbled into your personal interior body fluids to purify them by a variety of methods. The methods are simple. In the simplest physician a pplied method, doc- tors slowly inject specific quantities and concentr ations of ozone into the blood, always while the patient lies prone. In \"aut ohemotherapy\" some blood is taken out, ozonated, and returned to the body. T he Germans prefer this method, but I find it to be inefficient, costly, an d slow when compared to the newer methods, which are also perfectly safe wh en used correctly. These newer recirculatory methods are my favorites, and according to all the interviews I have done, the most effective. Usi ng them, the diseased patient blood is continuously circulated into ozone filled chambers and the leftover sludge of oxidized dead pathogens and toxi ns is filtered out. All this happens outside the body, and then the fresh c herry red blood is returned into the body in real time and continuousl y, as in the Medizone Inc., or Polyatomic Apheresis Ltd. proprietary syst ems. Proceeding this way, where most of the action happens outside the b ody is best. That way the body organs, like the liver, do not also have t o shoulder the added bur- den of detoxifying the system, especially since the usual prescribed toxic drugs have already weakened or seriously damaged th e body organs.

These people put spec ific qualities and quantities of pure oxygen/ozone into their bodily o penings, or soak most or parts of their body in a bag filled with the gas —never breathing the high concentrations of ozone, since our lungs detox ify too fast and get edema—the lung cells protectively swell up, if expo sed to \"too high\" con- centrations of ozone, meaning anything above the le vel that's found in nature. Then they use this humidified gas to give t hemselves ozone via \"rectal insufflation,\" where the ozone/oxygen gas i s introduced at specif- ic concentrations, durations, pressures, and volume s into the empty colon which transfers the ozone/oxygen into the blood. Th en there's the \"ozone sauna bagging\" method, which saturates the capillar ies in the skin, or they have a competently trained person slowly inject the m, again at specific concentrations and volumes. For safety, any such ve ry slow injections must always be done while the patient is lying pron e before, during, and after. Some bathe in or drink very dilute solutions of foo d grade hydrogen peroxide (which breaks down into water and releases oxygen in the blood), or any of the new oxygenated liquids and po wders. Each method has specific concentrations, volumes, durations and cautions, so work with a competently trained oxygen therapist to be s afe. My books, tapes and videos explain all this in more detail. Over the past eight years I have seen many, many pe ople rid their bod- ies of infections and other problems from being on oxygen therapies or ozone therapies, but they stuck to a full protocol— getting it daily, usually IV, in the right dosage, and the right concentratio ns, and combining it with other significant oxygen based modalities, proper d iet, antioxidants, col- loidal minerals, and enzymes.

GN: Sue Ann, you recently returned from the Philipp ines where you observed and recorded the effects of ozone treatmen t and a polyatomic apheresis therapy on a group of HIV-positive and AI DS patients. Would you give us the background of this and why it is so important that the peo- ple hear this story? SAT: Well, I was researching for a documentary that I had been work- ing on, called Living Proof—People Walking Away Fro m AIDS Healthy, because I was finding more and more evidence that t here were things that were in fact working for some AIDS cases and/or HIV -positive cases. In doing that research I came upon ozone therapy, and I also came upon all the controversy that surrounds it. So when I was of fered the opportunity to actually watch a trial happen first hand, in the Philippines, I jumped at the chance. I went to the Philippines and I was stunned with wh at I saw, because I was expecting the entire thing to take place in a s ort of wing of a hospi- tal, or something that looked a little bit more lik e what I expected medi- cine to look like. It was actually a clinic that wa s set up rather ad hoc to provide space to do justice to this trial, so I sta rted out a little on the scep- tical side, not knowing what I was getting into. There were nineteen HIV-positive people there, five of whom had full- blown AIDS. Over the course of about three weeks I watched the patients, or participants as they preferred to be called—six of whom were in pretty bad shape—watched them go through some pretty remar kable transfor- mations and I saw it happen before my very own eyes . There's no amount of journalists or medical people who can tell me th at what I saw I didn't see. I saw people who were unable to walk, be able to walk again. I saw people who were very, very ill just get considerabl y better and all of the treatment was cut short by a raid by the government ."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Alternative Medical Therapies 93 The Philippine government came in and shut down the entire operation, after only about one-third of the prescribed amount of treatment had been accomplished. It was a trial, so remember there was n't an absolute num- ber on how much treatment they were going to need—t hat was part of what they were there to establish—but one-third of what they were expect- ing would be close to the magic number of hours on the machine, had been accomplished, and in that period of time remar kable reversals in these people's conditions were evident. GN: Alright, describe the clinic. SAT: The [Cebu] clinic itself was an upscale home i n the Philippines. An upscale home in the Philippines looks kind of like an upscale home in America. It was a very large home, two storey, fair ly large lot, and behind the home they had built grass huts, but it wasn't a s crude as that makes it sound; it really had a vacation resort feel to it. It was not really unac- ceptable—and by Phillipines standards it was just f ine. I had an opportu- nity to go to one of the Philippines hospitals, and the cleanliness within the clinic beat the cleanliness of the Philippines hospitals that I visited. All the Filipino staff were excellent—I would pit t heir training against any training of any nursing staff anywhere in the w orld. But some of the things we take for granted, like refrigeration and insect control, they just have really come to learn to live without those thi ngs. The clinic was, by our own standards, crude, but it was, you know, acc eptable also. The materials were all new; it's just, again, it didn't meet my preliminary expectations. GN: Who was working there? SAT: There was a group from Australia—the clinic wa s actually owned by a couple named Bob and Rosanna Graham. The secon d group was PAI, the polyatomic apheresis unit group, and all they d id was supply the equipment and people to train the Philippine staff to use the equipment; and the third group was the Philippine staff which consisted of two Philippine doctors and eleven nurses. GN: And who were the patients? SAT: The patients were twenty Australians, nineteen with HIV, one with multiple cancers. GN: Is it illegal to enter the Philippines if you a re an HIV-positive person?"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"94 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries SAT: My understanding is that it is illegal to go i n HIV-positive, but Immigration does not question you; there is no test ing and I don't know that the patients realized that it was illegal. GN: Could you tell us of some the success stories o f the patients? SAT: The most dramatic success story was a man name d Paul. Paul is 42 years old, he had been HIV-positive since 1984, has full-blown AIDS and Kaposi's sarcoma. The lesions, the Kaposi's sarcoma lesions on the bot- tom of his feet, were so great when he left for the Philippines that he couldn't walk. He was in slippers for over a year. He could not wear shoes. He gingerly walked on the outsides of his fe et and it was very dif- ficult for him to get around at all. After eleven h ours of treatment on the machine, Paul's lesions went away. He was able to w ear leather shoes and, most importantly to Paul, he was off morphine for t he first time in four years. Prior to his going to the Philippines, the c ancer hospital had told him that he had reached the maximum amount of radia tion that he could receive safely, and he would have to simply continu e to increase his mor- phine to deal with his increasing pain. Paul believ ed that he had experi- enced just miraculous treatment, that in eleven hou rs of that treatment the lesions on his feet went away and he could wear sho es and walk normal- ly again. GN: Describe what the treatment consisted of. SAT: The polyatomic apheresis looks like the follow ing: a patient sits in a chair that looks a little like a dentist's chair. It's a comfortable chair. There are intravenous needles inserted in both of t heir arms, the blood coming out of the left arm is pulled through a pump that is in synch with the heart rate, and a circuit of blood is created b etween the left arm com- ing out and the right arm coming in. The blood goes through a series of tubes, goes down through a cascade tube where it is met with ozone under pressure, and at that point that's where the viral kill happens. The blood continues down through an escape tube, through a fi lter, back into their right arm. What you see visually is the blood exiti ng the left arm is a very black colour; it is black. It goes down through thi s cascade tube, which is a wide bore cascade tube, about an inch in diameter , and it goes back into the arm, the right arm, a bright cherry-red colour. It comes out looking alarmingly different—this is with the HIV patients— alarmingly different from what you would expect. Now, the first patient I saw on the machine was a p erson without HIV. She was a normal prison who had an infected foot, a nd her blood came"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Alternative Medical Therapies 95 out looking like yours and mine would, and went bac k in only slightly dif- ferently than it came out; so what I witnessed was that the HIV patients' blood was considerably blacker than a normal person 's and went back considerably lighter. That's, in a nutshell, what i t is. GN: Alright, now, what other parts of the therapy w ere included with this ozone treatment, and how does this ozone treatment differ from, let's say, one which would be done in New York where you pull out about, oh, a half pint of blood, ozonate it and put it back in t he arm over a fifteen- to twenty-minute period? SAT: I've never witnessed any of the other treatmen ts that you're talking about. The only two ozone treatments that I've seen actually operate are the polyatomic apheresis and, using the same equipm ent, a process called rectal insufflation where the ozone gas is put in t hrough a catheter into the rectum, which becomes an ozone enema, so to speak. Those two were used at the clinic and in conjunction with one anot her. Some of the par- ticipants in the study had experienced the treatmen t that you are talking about and had some success with it. What they belie ve from their own experience, what they told me, is that it was the d ifference between a Volkswagen and a Rolls Royce, from what they felt w ith the treatment, you're talking about getting in New York versus wha t they got in the Philippines. GN: So, it was far more productive in the Philippin es? SAT: Correct. GN: Now, what happened to these twenty patients? Wh ere are they at now and have there been any additional protocols for th ese people to follow? SAT: The turning point of everything was on March 1 9. The youngest participant was a 23-year-old woman named Jodi, and she had full-blown AIDS. It was a real tragedy because she really kind of represented all of our daughters, and her courage was phenomenal. She died in the clinic and that's when things started to tumble very quick ly. She died from a series of complications. I'm not a medical expert b ut I believe she received two insufflations too close together and h er body had trouble coping with the amount of ozone that she had taken in. She also received those against doctor's orders, so I guess it would have to be chalked up to human error rather than anything to do with the equ ipment. She received the ozone via the rectal insufflation."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"96 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries GN: You mean the Philippine doctors had suggested s he not take those? SAT: Actually, it was the American doctor, the expe rt on the ozone, who had said this girl shouldn't have another until she recovers a little bit. She had remarkable success on the equipment, though. Wh en I first arrived I was afraid Jodi was not going to make it until the equipment arrived. There were all kinds of customs hangups that preven ted the equipment from getting into the country and getting set up on time. So the patients arrived ahead of the equipment, which was a real ma nagement error because it just added too much stress to the patien ts. GN: By the way, who raided the clinic? SAT: It was raided by the Department of Immigration . GN: Was there any evidence the FDA had been involve d in the raid? SAT: There wasn't any evidence that the FDA had bee n involved; but what I was told was that the story really got under way when Australia's version of A Current Affair did a scathing story on the clinic and what the patients were about to experience, just as they wer e getting on the plane. I was told by another journalist in Australia whom I trust, that ACA is the one who went in to the Department of Immigration an d tipped them off. I was also told that the producers were directed by t heir upper management to do a 'chuck job' on the ozone therapy. And no ma tter what they were told, no matter how much positive information they were given, it never aired; and I watched this happen time after time. GN: So, in other words, there was a gross bias in t he media, from your interpretation, to prevent positive stories about t he success of ozone from getting back to the general population? SAT: It's not even a question of interpretation. I watched it happen; I watched the participants give interviews; I gave in terviews myself. We would turn on the TV and we would be shocked at wha t actually would show up. Paul, whom I was telling you about, would tell his entire story; he would show his feet, all of those things; and he made a comment in one of the television interviews where he said, \"After I got going I could just feel it in my heart that this was working.\" That li ttle snippet is the only thing that they would use, and then they would cut to the doctor saying, \"Well, you know, there's a certain amount of mind o ver matter,\" and all that kind of stuff. So they were completely dismiss ing the science of it and"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Alternative Medical Therapies 97 trying to make it sound like their improvements wer e all in their own minds; but fifteen patients had improved T-cell cou nts, one as high as a 70-percent increase. GN: I would like to shift gears, now, and bring in another individual to share a different perspective on this, and one that we haven't talked about in the past. Basil Wainwright, welcome to our progr amme. BW: Thank you very much, Gary. I must congratulate you on running a super programme, and a very courageous one too. GN: Basil, you are now incarcerated in Florida? BW: That's right, so if any of your listeners hear any background effects, I must apologise for that. I am currently incarcera ted down here in Miami. GN: From what I understand, you are a scientist and you are the inventor of this polyatomic machine, this ozone machine, and that you have been incarcerated without trial for three years. Is that correct? BW: Yes, I'm now well into my third year without tr ial and some seven violations of my basic human rights. GN: What are those violations? BW: Well, there's the 4th amendment and the 5th ame ndment, the 6th amendment has been violated, and the 8th, and 14th. So . . . GN: What has happened to your attorney filing prope r motions to get a fair and speedy trial? That's one of the constituti onal provisions for peo- ple who are incarcerated. I haven't heard of people waiting three years except this particular political detainee who was h ere in New York, the IRA supporter who was held for some seven years. BW: That is absolutely right. Well, it all started that—really, I suppose I should give you and your listeners a brief synopsis . I was working with Dr. Viebahn in Germany and I was brought into this project along with Medizone, and then got very much involved in the pr ocess. And I was somewhat intrigued to find that nobody had really d one any specific test- ing i.e., looking at the cytotoxic levels or, that is, the concentration of ozone, looking at the specific atomic structures of that, and also the con- tacting time; so there were an awful lot of areas t hat particularly interest-"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"98 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries ed me. I worked with the University of Medicine and Dentistry and also the Mt. Sinai Hospital with Dr. Weinburg and with Dr. M ichael Carpendale, and started to get very, very involved in the course. It was very evident there were some phenomenal resu lts being seen in the AIDS area and I started to look at it more in-d epth. There were sever- al controversies going on as to whether it was a fu nction of free radical reaction or oxidation—but of course both of those f unctions occur exten- sively—and also this ionisation; and I wanted to de termine the specific parameters of that, because when people refer to oz one you might just as well refer to a vehicle being involved in a collisi on because you're not really defining the atomic structure of ozone which can be multifold. There can be many aggregate combinations of molecul es which can have very specifically different responses, and I wanted to determine this. GN: Since 1985 you have been working with some Germ an doctors including Dr. Viebahn that you talked about. Now, y ou had a way of deter- mining that the ozone being used back then was not as effective as the way you could create a better ozone; they were using O 2 but you also saw O 3 and O 4 . BW: Yes. GN: Now tell us about what you found with what you created concerning viral inactivation. BW: Well, of course, I think it's very important fo r your listeners to know that the reason scientists refer to retroviruses' i nactivation as opposed to being killed is because normal micro-organisms have metabolic mecha- nisms, whereas a retrovirus could almost be conside red a piece of genet- ic material drifting around in the bloodstream. And so, it's rather difficult to kill a non-living thing, hence scientists refer to inactivation. We looked at these various techniques and procedures, includi ng the study which we did with Biotest in Miami. We determined that the G erman process worked but wouldn't be dramatically effective becau se they were not treating high enough volumes of blood. We wanted to see that once some- one had been taken back to HIV negative using polya tomic oxygen or ozone, they indeed remained negative. I think there is only one case that actually went back to positive so that was rather u nique because all the doctors were saying, Okay, so what? You get somebod y to negative, but in a couple of months' time they're going to go bac k to positive. Well, that was proven not to be the case, which I think even s urprised the Germans. And it might well be that the immune system k i c k s b ack in, and when we"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Alternative Medical Therapies 99 say negative we're looking at nucleic acid response or PCR work to deter- mine that; but certainly the patients were not goin g back to positive—that was very interesting. So we thought, okay, if these patients are going to use autohemothera- py which you referred to earlier, Gary, where you t ake out half a pint of blood, treat it with ozone, and then reinfuse it ba ck into the patient, that was taking typically eleven months, of course combi ned with a very rigid nutritional control as well. But using that process it was very evident that it's like chipping away at a mountain with an ice p ick when you're look- ing at the view of this pandemic facing mankind; an d it became very apparent in 1987 that the best way to go was with d ialysis or a dialysis- type procedure. So I worked with dialysis equipment and in fact filed my first dialysis patents using ozone in 1988. However, using ordinary dialysis equipment which is a hollow fibre membrane, we discovered there was too much homolysi s occurring as a result of that; also, the thing that we refer to as mechanical shear. The very fact of pumping the blood round outside the body ca n cause all sorts of trauma to cells—there are thermal reactions, there are pressure zones, the pumping head itself can actually crush cells—so we had to look at a num- ber of factors. And then, when we did more research , we found that O 4 in particular had some very unique responses. It has a phenomenal amount of electrons; as a matter of interest, in O 4 you have 40 electrons, and that makes it a very powerful negative ionising platform drifting around in your bloodstream. It was also far more stable than O 3 which again was completely the reverse of what everyone was project ing. It was very evident that O 3 had a better oxidative effect, and that was very effective in eliminating infected cells, but O 4 had the ability because of its ionisation to break down, we believe, the RN A, and of course uracil, which is a very important sugar combination—the 5-c arbon sugar in the virus RNA—was actually being broken down. Well, whe n we actually achieved this, we did our first study down at Biote st Laboratories here in Miami—hence my incarceration down here. We did this study and as far as I know, for the first time in history, using aph eresis we successfully converted HIV-positive to negative, and we could do this time and time again using PCR. That's the reason we came here, ac tually, because Biotest Laboratories in conjunction with Miami Univ ersity had this latest state-of-the-art equipment; and from that very mome nt, the FDA witch hunt started. We tried to keep a relatively low profile but of co urse the word soon got around the system, and then one night I came home a nd the SWAT team descended, guns drawn, and eight of them sort of cr ashed in the front door. I was arrested and charged with practicing medicine without a license,"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"100 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries which of course is complete nonsense. But the SWAT team, instead of look- ing for anything that might indeed have been releva nt to my practising med- icine without a licence, all they did was dig out a ll my patent specifications, technical data and intellectual mechanisms. So they came with a very spe- cific directive from the FDA, to seize all my intel lectual property rights. From there I was thrown into prison. Eventually I h ad charges from the FDA which boil down to sending and selling ozone ge nerators from inter- state—interstate trading laws, etc. Unfortunately, a couple of months after I was in prison, it was discovered that I had a ver y severe heart condition. In fact, if this radio show had been yesterday I do ubt very much if I could have done it. It's progressed to a point now where I'm collapsing and hav- ing blackouts and stuff, but still hanging in there . I've just recently done a technical paper. Well, from that episode this series of things went on, and as you quite rightly say—and I certainly won't bore your listene rs with the phenome- nal list of violations against me—I'm now into my t hird year; come October I'll be commencing my fourth year without a ny trial. I've just recently been appointed some new attorney who is ho peful of trying to get me bond. In fact, Dr. Michael Carpendale and other doctors very coura- geously were flying into Florida for a major hearin g in front of the judge. Everything was scheduled but at the very last momen t the FDA stepped in again and the hearing was cancelled, and my researc h team had to franti- cally phone around and cancel everyone coming in. I did get bond, much to the amazement of the FDA, which was really an ad ministrative error, and I was out for a few months. During that time we managed to get a num- ber of apheresis systems put together and out into studies. Most of the studies which were conducted in and aro und the United States of course have already had the FDA SWAT team s descend on them, close them down and seize equipment. And we've had things reported like seven P24-antigen negatives, a couple of PCR negati ves, but at no time have we ever been able to get into the real complet ion of a study. In every case, I think the doctors would tell you they've se en absolutely dramatic results, and that's not from me because this inform ation has been fed back to us. They are very concerned that they're prevent ed from pursuing this, since the process does really show some pretty dram atic potential. The only way we are ever going to get this out there is if the AIDS groups get up and demand polyatomic apheresis so that we can g et these studies up and running. We've got a group working with two ver y, very prominent stars who hope to apply sufficient pressure to be a ble to get this achieved. During our studies we managed to determine that pro tein aspects in the blood, in other words, high protein levels would ha ve an inhibiting effect on the success of the procedure. The normal procedu re that has been adopt-"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Alternative Medical Therapies 101 ed by the Germans, i.e., introducing antioxidants—w hich is very popular over here too—was also negating the effects of ozon e. Everyone in the United States can enjoy the wonderful efficacy of o zone; there is nothing against the law that you can't use it, and there ar e several ways of apply- ing it. In our protocols, prior to treatment the pa tients will be receiving no antioxidants so that we get the maximum oxidative e ffect from the O 3 component which we use 2 percent by weight, and 6 p ercent by weight of O 4 ; and we have a pretty rigid nutritional programme too. GN: So let me see if I can put this into perspectiv e. Basil Wainwright is now in a jail in Florida for developing a special f orm of ozone machine that puts an O 4 into the body. There are a number of patients, est imated as high as 200, who have undergone this polyatomic aph eresis treatment so far. These have included HIV, environmental and deg enerative diseases, approximately thirty persons with AIDS. Of those th irty people, all show dramatic improvement, seven are P24-antigen negativ e, and two are PCR negative, meaning there is no HIV viral DNA found i n their bodies, and the P24 means there is no active replication—all re plication of the HIV is done. For the effort, you have been put in prison w ithout trial. When the doctors did come to testify on your behalf, the FDA saw that the hearings were postponed. On a technical glitch you were allo wed out, and then when they found out the technical glitch they put y ou back in; and you have been in violation of several due processes inc luding a speedy trial. Why weren't the other doctors put on trial or arres ted? Why were you the only person involved in this? BW: Well, because I was the primary motivating forc e and the one that indeed held the patents in the United States office for polyatomic aphere- sis, which is quite unique. The only reason that I can think of is that I enjoyed the energy in working in the process. We ha ve a wonderful team, they're all terribly dedicated to helping people, a nd we would like to think we are motivated in attempting to do God's work. Su e Ann and everyone else who have been involved have expressed love and compassion to all these patients, so it's been more than just a resea rch project for me. I thor- oughly enjoyed working with the patients. Of course , the pharmaceutical companies cannot file a patent on ozone, and you ca n only file patents on the intellectual property rights or the designs of the delivery mechanisms to the patient; and being as we have those, I suppo se the best thing they could do and their only reaction was to throw me in prison, hoping that it would completely bring everything to a halt. It has n't done that. There's been a dedicated bunch of people out there; they definitely need more support. We would certainly provide equip ment for AIDS"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"102 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries groups on the United States if they would only get up and demand poly- atomic apheresis and demand studies which they coul d do. We would be only too pleased to provide the equipment and, inde ed, a number of very top doctors are prepared to come along and offer th eir services and mon- itor and support these test studies. You undoubtedl y know that Ed McCabe has been doing some tremendous work in trying to op en people's horizons on these issues, and Ed of course has been very sup portive and he's become very supportive because he's been seeing the successes. Unfortunately, a lot of the doctors that have been involved in the research have had terrible pressure applied to them; in fact , their very jobs and livelihoods have been threatened by the FDA, which is very, very sad. I must admit when I first came to the States in 1987 on this particular pro- ject, the people told me this sort of thing existed in the United States and I thought it was all James Bond stuff, but of cours e I soon learnt to the contrary that indeed it was fact, and here I am. Al l I want to do in fact is get out of here and research and work for the bette rment of mankind and just simply conduct God's work. In fact, I've just finished two scientific papers while I've been incarcerated, and I've been working very, very hard. A lot of good things: we've got a Middle East proje ct which has been confirmed which will be up and running very soon; t he Canadian govern- ment with NATO of course, as you've probably read, indicated great inter- est. Well, they've actually approached us and we've had talks with them about structuring a very special process which we'v e developed. It's from the blood bag to the patient, so for the armed forc es, if they get injured out in the field and they're having delivery or transfu sion of a unit of blood, there's this process we've developed which goes in series or in line with the IV to the patient, which actually purifies the blood with polyatomic structures before it goes into the wounded soldier. So, despite my various bouts of illnesses and I must admit it's been a bit touch and go at times, I've certainly been keeping myself active, Gary, an d as I've said I've cer- tainly been following your programme with intent an d your work with intent, and I hope your listeners out there realise what a super person you are and how you're projecting this work and making this awareness to the people out there. GN: Thank you Basil Wainwright, and let's hope for the best and that jus- tice will be served by being fair and by seeing tha t your machine is test- ed. I want to thank you also for being on today, Su e Ann Taylor. Any clos- ing thought for us? SAT: Well, the closing thought that I have is, afte r the raid the mayor of the city gave the Department of Health the opportun ity that if they want-"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Alternative Medical Therapies 103 ed the study to continue, he would make space avail able in a hospital and make the patients the guests of the city. For them to turn down that offer and shut it down without looking at the patients' r ecords, of which the blood tests all showed improvements, or watching a demonstration— that's when I started to believe that there was som e level of a conspiracy happening right before my eyes, because they had ma de up their minds in the face of an offer from the mayor and said let's finish it right here. The only other point that I wanted to make, that I foun d alarming, is that peo- ple who have the ability to make those decisions we re that closed-minded about the patients' pleas that this could save our lives, that they shut the door in their faces. GN: Sue Ann Taylor, you learned a good lesson, and that lesson unfortu- nately is a bitter one: not always do the patients count when there is a political or economic agenda ahead of their interes t.

The peo- ple and procedures described in these pages are by no means inclusive, only the most notable or most promising. The FDA (Food and Drug Administration) is the gover nment police force which approves experimental studies for those it favors and hinders approval for those it dislikes. It conducts semi-le gal break-ins (constitu- tional procedures are often ignored), confiscates r ecords so that critical documentation is often lost or at least unavailable for months or years, and at times has interfered with constitutional protect ions through conspirato- rial relationships with private organizations who s hare the same suppres- sive goals. New medical breakthroughs that threaten the sanctioned and financially lucrative treatments are ignored or \"st udied\" for years. The FDA thus frequently subverts its legislated purpose which is to promote and protect the public health. Having lived in Wash ington, D.C., I know that the FDA is regarded by many astute civil serva nts as the federal agency with the lowest morale. A dark cloud of oppr essive inertia, cor- ruption and bureaucratic sloth pervades its corrido rs. Dr. J.

The FDA stop ped the vaccine's use in a federal court hearing where neither the cancer patients nor their doc- tors were allowed to testify. U.S. Senator Stephen Young of Ohio pro- tested—to no avail. Senator Young could get nowhere with FDA Commissioner James L. Goddard. Senator Young recall ed: I could not move them. They would not even agree to a modification of the ruling (banning the Rand vaccine), which would at least allow the 100 (cancer) patients at Richmond Heights (Ohio) to complete their injections. The Justice Department was prepared to go along, but the FDA Commissioner, Dr. James Goddard, was adamant, e ven belliger- ent. It's wrong of the government to snatch away th is hope when there is no evidence against its use offered in court. It 's damnably wrong. It is known that when FDA Commissioner Goddard's ow n wife had serious health problems and orthodox medicine could not help her, Goddard contacted alternative health practitioners who quietly healed his wife. But for the suffering victims of cancer who n eeded the Rand vac- cine or some other nontraditional treatment, Goddar d lowered the boom, using the federal courts to enforce his dictum. Suc h are the ways of the FDA. Goddard's greatest disservice to the American peopl e was his persecu- tion of DMSO, a simple molecule which often brought miraculous pain relief and offered numerous possibilities for medic al advancement in other areas, including cancer. One respected scienc e writer suggested that Goddard crushed DMSO research in order to gain incr eased police pow- ers from Congress. The FDA has never admitted its e rrors regarding DMSO although the positive studies from qualified s cientists number over a thousand while the FDA's criticisms have bee n shown to be almost completely based on lies or unsubstantiated rumors. Yet by the late 1980s, twenty years later, the FDA continues to imprison D MSO advocates. The malignity of Goddard's arbitrary and conscienceless acts in 1966-1968 against reputable scientists, dedicated doctors and the public good is one of the darkest chapters of FDA history.

In the years that followed, FDA officials simply refused t o expose the agency's \"dirty laundry.\" Hence the on-going suppression of what many recognize as \"the major drag of the century.\" In any case, Go ddard instilled fear into honest researchers and physicians as no previous FD A Commissioner had done. He rained careers. He introduced an intensifi ed police force men- tality into the FDA with his emphasis on hiring ex T-men and G-men. He consciously blacklisted scientists as punishment fo r opposing him. And members of his agency, either with his encouragemen t or his acquies- cence, openly began ignoring the Constitution for t he sake of promotions and power. Pat McGrady, Sr.'s book, The Persecuted Drug: The S tory of DMSO, detailed what Goddard's FDA did. McGrady described \"the no-knock sys- tem, the photocopying of private papers, bugging, p unitive investigations, slander and libel, character assassination, forgery , lying and blackmail.\" One scientist declared to McGrady: For the first time in my life I know fear.

A few years after the DMSO suppression, one of Godd ard's top aides, Billy Goodrich, left the FDA with his pension and b ecame president of a food association regulated by the FDA. A personal f riend who had been president of the food association took over Billy G oodrich's position at the FDA. They simply switched jobs! Congressmen scr eamed in pro- test. It was such a blatant demonstration of the \"m usical shuffle\" (which Congress had previously observed but ignored) that they had to make some noise this time in order to avert public wrath . Still after all the sound and fury, nothing happened. Goddard himself became Chairman of the Board of Orm ont Drug and Chemical Company a few years after leaving the FDA. A study conducted by the U.S. Congress in 1969 reve aled that 37 of 49 top officials of the FDA who left the agency moved into high corpo- rate positions with the large companies they had re gulated. A General Accounting Office (GAO) study of the FDA in 1975 re vealed that 150 FDA officials owned stock in the companies they wer e supposed to regu- late. The record of \"conflict of interest\" (or wors e) within the FDA is deep and extensive. In 1976, Dr. J. Richard Crout of the FDA admitted t hat \"endless ques- tions\" was a favored technique within the agency to discourage any re- searcher who sought approval for an unorthodox canc er therapy. Bureaucratic obstruction is a weapon as deadly as a gun when the lives of innocent millions are at stake. It is a delusion to consider such institution- alized, orchestrated conduct, consciously chosen ei ther because of orders from above or personal inclination, as anything oth er than white collar murder. In fact, it closely resembles the role carr ied out by the bureaucrats who pushed the paper in Nazi Germany. The policy-ma kers may not fully perceive the effect of their actions, but the horro r has gone on for too many decades to allow a plea of ignorance to be tot ally convincing. In 1972, Dean Burk, Ph.D., of the National Cancer I nstitute (head of their cytochemistry section and a veteran of thirty -two years at the agency) declared in a letter to a member of Congress that h igh official of the FDA,"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Alternative Medical Therapies 109 AMA, ACS and the U.S. Department of Health, Educati on and Welfare (now Health and Human Services or HHS) were deliber ately falsifying information, literally lying, committing unconstitu tional acts and in other ways thwarting potential cancer cures to which they were opposed. Dr. Burk's famous May 30, 1972 letter to Congressma n Louis Frey, Jr. dealt with the issue of why the FDA had revoked an Investigative New Drug (IND) application. The IND application, accord ing to Dr. Burk, was superior to many routinely approved. But it involve d testing laetrile, a controversial, nonpatentable product opposed by the California Medical Association (CMA). FDA approved the original applic ation, then rescind- ed the license, apparently because of pressure from the surgeon general, a member of the CMA and a laetrile foe. Dr. Burk was not an advocate of laetrile. He was, h owever, in favor of fair testing. He was totally opposed to what he blu ntly called \"misleading and indeed fraudulent\" FDA reports. In his correspo ndence with Con- gress, he openly referred to \"FDA corruption.\" Corruption indeed. It takes several forms. Refusing to allow investiga- tion of a non-toxic compound which might help cance r patients is one. Failing to assert itself when a drug tested on huma n beings was deter- mined to cause cancer is another. Here are the fact s of such a case: In August 1969 it was learned that a drug called Ci nanserin, produced by E. R. Squibb and Sons, Princeton, New Jersey, cause d tumors in the livers of rats. Human testing of the drug was thus stopped. B ut Squibb's executives did not want to do follow-ups on the humans who had taken Cinanserim. For three years, the FDA tried to persuade Squibb t o do follow-up stud- ies. (Compare this approach with what the FDA does to alternative cancer treatments which actually work—raids, confiscation of documents, jail, etc. With the large drug companies, FDA tries persu asion!) Finally, in 1972, the FDA and the National Academy of Sciences set up a committee to examine procedures on follow-ups whe n a drug was found to be dangerous. Who was appointed to head the comm ittee? The vice-pres- ident of Squibb whom the FDA had tried for three ye ars to persuade to do follow-ups on those people who had been given the c ancer-causing drug! The FDA has a long history of ignoring dangerous dr ugs and chemical additives marketed by the big drug companies while using bureaucratic delays, legal harassment, unconstitutional procedur es, and even falsified evidence to stop unorthodox cancer treatments. In 1 964, the FDA initiat- ed a multimillion dollar prosecution of Andrew Ivy, vice-president and professor of physiology at the University of Illino is.

Over 20,000 cancer patients had supposedly benefite d from Krebiozen. One United States Senate Committee lawyer personall y assessed 530 cases and concluded that Krebiozen was effective. Krebiozen has never been tested objectively. The FD A used illegal methods to stop it, methods which have been part of a conscious goal of the FDA to dictate what medicine a citizen is permi tted to use and what he may not use. Combined with the questionable beha vior of FDA offi- cials, the stock links to the large drug companies, and the testimony of FDA employees that conscious cover-ups were common, the intention of the FDA to dictate individual medicine has to be re cognized as one of the most dangerous threats to freedom that has ever exi sted. Peter Temin, a professor at MIT, carefully studied FDA history and pol- icy for his 1980 book, Taking Your Medicine: Drug R egulation in the United States. His conclusion, based on a very care ful, close look at FDA is frightening: The most important facet of FDA regulation is the a gency's expression of its conviction that individuals—both doctors and consumers—cannot make reasonable choices among drugs. The agency tried with increasing success to deny dr ug prescribers and users the option of taking \"innocuous\" drugs, t hat is, to force them to use drugs the FDA regards as appropriate for the ir condition. Despite evidence which extends for decades, reveali ng criminal behav- ior in the one agency that holds the power to permi t tests of alternative cures for cancer, Congress has done nothing. One ni ght in Washington, D.C., I found out why. I was introduced to the aide of one of the most powerful U.S. Representatives in Congress. His boss had been in Washington for many years. Yet, despite the Congres sman's powerful committee position and ranking status in the majori ty party, he was unable to do anything with the health officials at FDA or NCI. After a number of drinks, this Congressman's aide told me that FDA an d NCI were protect- ed fiefdoms. They wrote their own legislation, perm itting only minor changes by Congress. They ignored Congressional com plaints. They were extensively tied to the big drug companies. \"They k now no one controls them. No one is able to take a sword and tell them where to go,\" the aide said. He leaned across the table and whispered, \"On ly national security procedures are as tightly controlled, without outsi de examination. Only national security. Does that tell you something?\" It told me that the monster was real and dangerous if some of the most powerful men in the U.S. Congress, w i t h their massi ve egos and indepen- dent political bases, were afraid of it."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Alternative Medical Therapies 111 G. E. Griffin, author of World Without Cancer, made explicit the fun- damental, systematic wrong which has emerged out of the various cross- currents that make up the FDA—underpaid civil serva nts playing it safe; drug companies and their Washington lawyers putting unending pressure on the bureaucrats; academic medicos controlling th e approval process and restricting the individual doctor's choice; rev olving door employment between FDA and universities/drug companies, and be hind-the-scenes political deals. According to Griffin, the FDA did two things: (1) they \"protected\" the big drug companies and were subsequ ently rewarded; and (2) they attacked—using the government's police pow ers—those who threatened the big drug companies, be it a young co mpany with a new product such as DMSO, or natural health store produ cts such as food, vit- amins, minerals or other self-healing (non-drug, no n-doctor) methods. Griffin wrote the following about the FDA: First, it is providing a means whereby key individu als on its payroll are able to obtain both power and wealth through granti ng special favors to certain politically influential groups that are sub ject to its regulation. This activity is similar to the \"protection racket\" of o rganized crime: for a price, one can induce FDA administrators to provide \"protection\" from the FDA itself. Secondly, as a result of this political favoritism, the FDA has become a primary factor in that formula whereby cartel-ori ented companies in the food and drug industry are able to use the poli ce powers of govern- ment to harass or destroy their free-market competi tors. And thirdly, the FDA occasionally does some genuine public good with whatever energies it has left over after servi ng the vested political and commercial interest of its first two activities . There is only one solution. No reform will work. No changing of per- sonnel will have any long term effect. No new laws dealing with regula- tions. Only one solution. It was provided by a southern doctor now living in New York City who has observed the monster in action for many years. Raymond Keith Brown, M.D., outlined the solution in his book, Cancer, AI DS and the Medical Establishment. He described how the power which FDA has to approve drugs and technology has to be eliminated and repla ced with the solitary role of testing for effectiveness and safety, the r esults being the basis for FDA labeling. The individual physician and individu al patient would regain the responsibility to use or not use a given-drug o r technology. Dr. Brown recommended that The FDA should follow a simple rating system for ef fectiveness and safety.

Judgment of the effectiveness of any medical product or device should not be vested in any governmen- tal agency or institutions, but should be returned to the province of the individual physician. Freedom of choice for medical materials, therapy and methods must be put on the same footing as civi l liberties and as vigorously protected. One of the better scholars in this field—Robert G. Houston—says simply: There should be curbs on the FDA—on its powers to i ntrude into the pri- vate practice of medicine ... the FDA should not be dictating to doctors what they can and cannot do. Richard Ericson, a dedicated husband of a cancer vi ctim, eloquently concurred (Cancer Treatment: Why So Many Failures?) : A physician should be able to prescribe any type of cancer treatment that he considers best for the patient, with the pa tient's consent and knowledge, without stringent governmental regulatio ns that are now in force. Congress should consider such problems when new guidelines are enacted. Only when FDA concentrates on the blatant health me naces such as overtly misleading health product claims or drugs s hown to cause death and injury; only when FDA ceases to be the bully bo y for the big drug companies and other vested interests; and only when FDA again allows physicians, nonconventional healers and their patie nts their choice of ther- apeutic treatments ... will it regain its legitimat e government function.

The clinic is owned by Jonathan V.

Also raided at the sa me time was the For Your Health pharmacy operated by Raymond Suen. As of mid -July, no charges had been filed against anyone. Suen, together with Kent Littleton, Chief Chemist, Meridian Valley Clinical Laboratory (Kent, Washington), had collabo rated with Wright to submit a well-documented article, \"Testing for vita min K: An osteoporo- sis risk factor.\" (Am. Clin. Lab. 8[2], 16 [1989]). Wright et al. traced the connection between vitamin K and bone formation in promoting the gamma carboxylation of glutamic acid in osteocalcin that binds calcium ions leading to bone calcification. (In its identic al but much better known function in blood clotting, vitamin K promotes the binding of calcium toprothrombin in its transformation to thrombin.) W hile considerable vit- amin K is presumably synthesized by normal intestin al flora, many clini- cians are aware that normal microflora are much les s frequent today than in the preantibiotic days. Care must be taken in sa mple preparation and in the frequently used HPLC analysis of vitamin K in s erum, but Wright finds that appropriate dietary changes and suppleme ntation almost always result in substantial improvement in serum levels i n just a few weeks."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"Harry Hoxsey; An Introduction to His Life and Work Katherine Smith Harry Hoxsey was born in 1902, into a family which had been successfully curing cancer for several generations using herbal medicine. According to Hoxsey, the healing power of the herbs used in the family's secret formula was discovered by his great grandfather in the nine teenth century. In 1840 or thereabouts John Hoxsey had a horse whic h became sick with a cancerous sore. He fully expected the animal to die, but when it seemed to be miraculously gaining in strength, he o bserved the animal closely. He noticed that the horse would go and eat the wild herbs (\"weeds\") in a certain corner of its paddock. By th e time the horse made a full recovery from the cancer which had threatene d its life, John Hoxsey had become convinced it was the herbs which it had consumed which were responsible for its reprieve from death. He refined the herbs over the years, treating other animals afflicted with cancer. In time he developed an herbal tonic t o be taken internally as well as a powdered formula—which could be mixed int o a paste—to be applied to external lesions and tumors. When John Hoxsey died, he passed the knowledge of h is cancer treat- ment to his son, who later passed the knowledge dow n to his son, Harry's father. Harry Hoxsey was told the secret formula of the fam ily's anti-cancer preparations by his father when the older man was o n his death bed. (See inset \"The Hoxsey Family Formulas\" on page 116 for a listing of the herbs.) At that time, the eighteen-year-old Harry H oxsey was already skilled in the application of the powdered formula to skin cancers. He was also familiar with the dosage for the herbal tonic, having assisted his father in the unofficial cancer clinic he had held in the evenings after his work. With his father's death, however, Harry Hoxsey gain ed not only the responsibility of being the sole inheritor of an im portant cure for cancer,"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Alternative Medical Therapies 115 but also the responsibility for taking over his fat her's role of supporting the family. Harry Hoxsey worked hard at a number of jobs, inclu ding coal miner, since he not only had to provide for his mother and younger siblings, but he also dreamed of going to medical school. Hoxsey believed that if he were to become a bona fide M.D., he would be able t o carry on the fami- ly tradition of healing cancer without fear of cens ure, or being prosecuted for practising medicine without a license. To this end, he resolved not to treat any people wi th cancer until he had qualified as a doctor. However, after he was approa ched by an old friend of his father who had cancer, Hoxsey concluded that he couldn't withhold a life-saving treatment from someone who needed his help. After this first unofficial patient was cured of his cancer, word sp read and Hoxsey soon found his skills in demand. As a consequence of successfully treating cancer pa tients as an unqual- ified healer, Hoxsey found that his dream of becomi ng a doctor was to remain unfulfilled. The word had been put out withi n the community of organised medicine to blacklist the untutored young man who was treat- ing cancer patients more successfully than the vast majority of the med- ical profession of the time (with a few notable ren egade exceptions such as Dr. Max Gerson). No medical school in the United States would accept Hoxsey as a student. For the rest of his working life, Hoxsey by virtue of his lack of formal qualifications was officially employed in his own c linics as a technical assistant by other doctors who were brave enough to face AMA reprisals and work with him. Hoxsey also spent the rest of his life being harass ed by the AMA, whose actions periodically forced him to close the clinics where he was successfully treating cancer, and move on to anothe r location. Hoxsey, charged only modest fees for his cancer treatment i n accordance to a promise he had made to his dying father. He never c harged anyone who could prove they were unable to pay, but he was rew arded for his human- itarianism by being hauled into court over one hund red times for \"prac- ticing medicine without a license.\" Representatives of organised medicine even manipulated Hoxsey's own family into bringing a civil suit against him, having duped them into believing that Hoxsey h ad stolen a valuable economic asset from the family when his father had relinquished the secret formulas to him. Despite his continued persecution by the AMA, Hoxse y remained hope- ful that his cancer curing formulas might eventuall y be accepted by the medical profession. He submitted documented case st udies to various o f f i c i a l bodies as proof of the efficacy of his tre atment. He also put out a"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"116 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries bold challenge to the medical profession: that if h e were allowed to choose his own cancer cases so that he would not be faced with the impos- sible task of trying to treat people who were on de ath's doorstep, he would guarantee that 80 percent of those people he treate d would be cured. Organised medicine continued to persecute and prose cute Hoxsey, even though in court his enemies publicly acknowledged t hat his treatment had merit. Despite this admission, Hoxsey's treatment f or cancer was nonethe- less driven out of the United States in 1963. Like the unconventional nutritional theory devised by Dr. Max Gerson, those doctors—and patients—who wish to use Hoxsey's external powders and herbal formu- la have been forced to relocate their practice out of the United States, in Tijuana, Mexico—a long way away from the hundreds o f thousands of people most in need of their assistance. The Hoxsey Family Formulas Originally developed in the nineteenth century by J ohn Hoxsey, the Hoxsey Therapy for cancer has been passed down from generation to generation. This therapy is comprised of herbs and other substances believed to have antitumor effects . Some of these substances are combined to form a tonic that is taken internally, while others are used to make a salve d esigned to heal external lesions. The following shows the spec ific ingredients used in each of the Hoxsey therapies: Internal tonic: licorice root potassium iodide Cascara amarga red clover prickly ash bark buckthorn bark burdock root External paste: stillingia root zinc chloride berberis root antimony trisulfide pokeberries and root bloodroot For those who cannot travel to get these formulas, there are companies in the United States that sell similar co mbinations designed to have the same effect."},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"The AMA's Successful Attempt to Suppress My Cure for Cancer Harry M.

There was plenty of room not only for our rapidly-expanding c linic, but for a twen- ty-five bed hospital. He said his bank would financ e the entire transaction. Accordingly one Sunday afternoon in March, accompan ied by Dr. Miller, I appeared before a meeting of the membersh ip in the auditorium of the Lodge and presented our proposal. To reinfor ce my arguments near- ly a dozen of my cured patients were present includ ing Larkin, McVicker, Hunter, Bulpitt, Mrs. Sleighbough, Mrs. Stroud and Fred Baugh, secretary of the Lodge. After hearing their testimony the mem bers voted unani- mously to sell us the building. At this point a stranger in the audience demanded t he floor. He identi- fied himself as Lucius O. V. Everhard, an insurance broker and member of a Moose Lodge in Chicago. He said he'd recently written a large poli- cy on the life of Dr. Malcolm L.

If Hoxsey is willing I'll telephone Dr. Harris and try to get hi s support for a clinic in Chicago, where the Hoxsey treatment can reach a wid er audience.\" I was more than willing, I was excited and elated. Here was the answer to all my problems. With the backing of Dr. Harris, medical recognition of the Hoxsey treatment was a foregone conclusion. Mor eover his recommen- dation would be an \"Open, Sesame\" to any medical s chool in the country. 117"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"118 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries Everhard immediately put through a long-distance ca ll, reached the eminent AMA official at his home, poured out what h e'd just seen and heard, and urged that Dr. Miller and I be permitted to demonstrate our treatment on patients at one of the Chicago hospita ls. There was a pause, then came the reply: \"Have them meet me tomorrow morning at 8:30 at the south door of the Alexian Brothers Hospital!\" The distance from Taylorville to Chicago by road is more than 200 miles. Setting out in my car immediately after dinn er that same night Everhard, Dr. Miller and I arrived at our destinati on just before midnight. We checked into the Sherman Hotel. Bright and early next morning we were waiting outside the hospital. Promptly at 8:25 a shiny black Locomobile piloted b y a chauffeur drew up at the door and Dr. Harris alighted. He was a th in, slightly-built gen- tleman (about 5 feet 6 inches tall) in his late fif ties with steel-gray hair and a small, closely-cropped mustache. Well dressed and carefully groomed, he moved with the dignity and self-assurance of a m an of distinction. As he gave me a limp hand and inspected me from head t o foot I was painful- ly conscious of my rough, calloused miner's paws an d ill-fitting store clothes, my Sunday best. Leading the way into the h ospital, he said: \"I have a patient I want you to see. Frankly, he's a terminal case. We've done all we can for him, so there's no harm in expe rimenting. I don't expect you to cure him. But if your treatment produ ces no unfavorable reaction, we'll go ahead and try it on other cases not so far advanced.'\" That sounded fair enough. We took the elevator to t he third floor where we were met by Dr. Daniel Murphy, the residen t in charge. After a brief conference with Dr. Harris he took us to the room where the patient lay. Thomas Mannix, 66-year-old former desk sergeant at the Sheffield Avenue Police Station, seemed more dead than alive. His cadaverous appearance was enhanced by a head completely bald e xcept for a fringe of gray hair, sunken orbs, long sharp nose and griz zled mustache over a bony chin. The mottled skin hung loosely from his s crawny neck, his once-burly frame had shrunk to little more than 70 pounds. The chart at the foot of his bed showed that a prodigious amount of morphine was being administered at regular intervals to dull his pain.

It was seared and baked by intensive X-ray treatment w hich had, however, failed to halt the progress of the disease. After a minute examination of the patient, Dr. Mill er drew me aside and told me that in his opinion there wasn't a ghost of a chance that Mannix"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Alternative Medical Therapies 119 would survive our treatment.

Dr. Harris and Dr. Murphy watched intently as I app lied a thick coat- ing of the yellow powder to the gaping lesion, and Dr. Miller put a dress- ing over it. We left a bottle of our internal medic ine with directions that the patient receive a teaspoonful three times per d ay, and advised the two doctors that we would be back in a week to administ er another treatment. On our way back to Taylorville, Dr. Miller observed : \"If we pull this one through, it'll be a miracle!\" I patted his arm. \"Don't worry, Doc.

Within two weeks the surface of the pustulant sore turned black and start- ed to dry, a sure sign that our medicine was workin g on the malignancy. Within four weeks a hard crust had formed, the canc er was shrinking and pulling away at the edges from the normal tissu e. Moreover the rapid improvement in the patient's general physical condi tion amazed all who saw him. He was able to sit up now, his eyes were b right and alert and the pain had vanished, he no longer needed morphine to sustain him, his appetite had returned, he was beginning to pick up weight. Two weeks later he was walking around, taking care of his physical needs, champing at the bit and impatient to get bac k to work. When he saw us he chortled: \"I guess we fooled 'em, didn't we, Doc? Can't wait to get back to the station house and see the look on the faces of the boys. They was all set to give me an Inspector's funeral.\" His daughter Kate Mannix, a registered nurse who ha d assisted in the care of her father, stopped us in the corridor to e xpress the gratitude of the family. \"We feel just as if he's been raised from the dead, \" she declared. \"We'd given up hope. Anyone who's seen a loved one dying of cancer will know what a nightmare we've been through. Now we're just about the happiest people on earth. We'll remember you in all our pray ers. And if there's any other way we can show our appreciation, please let us know.\" To me these simple, heartfelt words were the riches t reward any man could ask. That same day we informed Dr. Harris that necrosis of the cancerous"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"120 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries mass in the policeman's shoulder was complete, it h ad separated from the normal tissue and could be lifted out within two da ys. He could scarcely believe his ears, insisted on examining the patient himself. \"This is something I want every doctor in the hospi tal to witness,\" he asserted. \"Would you be willing to perform that ope ration in the amphi- theatre before the entire staff?\" Dr. Miller and I welcomed the opportunity. That Wednesday at 10 A . M . when we arrived at the amphitheatre of the Alexian Brothers Hospital we found it buzzing with excitement. The gallery of seats surrounding the operating pit was crowded with more than sixty interns, house physicians and visiting doctor s. Scrubbed and gowned, we took up our positions in the pit beside Dr. Harris. He cleared his throat, and the gallery suddenly was silent. He began with a concise review of the case, detaile d the various treat- ments given the patient, described the latter's con dition when he was turned over to us. Then he introduced us and explai ned our procedure. When he'd finished the patient was wheeled in and w e took over. Dr. Miller removed the bandages from Mannix's shoul der. Self-con- scious and tense with awareness that scores of trai ned eyes were follow- ing every move under the bright operating light, I picked up the forceps, scraped and probed the black mass of necrosed tissu e. It moved freely at the perimeter but was still anchored at the base. I worked it loose, lifted it out with the forceps, deposited it on the white ena mel tray provided for that purpose. And that's all there was to the opera tion. Dr. Harris inspected the cavity left by the tumor. There was no sign of blood, pus or abnormal tissue, clean scar tissue al ready had begun to form. \"In time it will heal level with the surrounding fl esh,\" I told him. \"There will be no need for plastic surgery.\" Shaking his head incredulously, he declared: \"It's amazing, if I hadn't seen it I wouldn't believe it!\" Then, looking closer: \"What about the necrosis in t he clavicular bone?\" \"That was caused by X-ray. It too will slough off.\" Doctors and interns filled the pit and crowded arou nd the operating table, inspecting the patient, examining the necros ed tissue, firing ques- tions at Dr. Miller and me. The entire demonstratio n had taken less than half an hour but it was nearly noon before we could break away. Dr. Harris accompanied us to the door and asked where we were stopping. I told him I was at the Sherman Hotel, and would re main there a cou- ple of days before returning to Taylorville. He pro mised to get in touch with us before we left. On our way back to the hote l I was j u b i l a n t . \"We did it! Now they'll have to admit that we have a treatment that cures cancer!\""},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Alternative Medical Therapies 121 Dr. Miller smiled skeptically. \"It's not that easy. Wait until Harris gets a chance to think it over and discusses it with oth er doctors. They'll come up with all kinds of reasons why our treatment wasn 't responsible for the patient's recovery. There's more at stake here than you think—prestige, and money, millions invested in X-ray and radium eq uipment. . .\" At that time it sounded fantastic, and I quickly ch anged the subject. Early next morning I was awakened by a telephone ca ll from Dr. Harris. \"I'd like to have a talk with you,\" he said. \"I'm a t my office in the Field Annex, about two blocks from your hotel. Can you co me right over?\" Glancing at my watch, I discovered that it was just 7:15 A . M . I agreed to meet him in half an hour. Hastily I showered, sh aved, threw on my clothes and—postponing breakfast—set off to keep th e appointment. Dr. Harris occupied an extensive suite on the seven th floor of the imposing office building. Bristling with early morn ing energy he met me at the door, ushered me into his private office, mo tioned me into a chair beside his desk. Surveying me appraisingly, he bega n: \"Hoxsey, the demonstration you put on yesterday has opened up an entirely new vista in the treatment of cancer. I sp ent most of last evening discussing the Mannix case with some of my colleagu es, and they agree that his amazing recovery is convincing evidence th at chemical com- pounds such as you use offer the best hope to eradi cate this disease. It's not just the yellow powder you used; that I suppose is an escharotic* It's the amazing improvement in his general condition as the result of the medicine you've been giving him.\" This was it, the official recognition I'd been seek ing so avidly. Giddy with triumph, I could scarcely control an impulse t o jump up and grate- fully shake his hand. \"Of course,\" he cautioned, \"it's much too early to say that Mannix is cured of cancer. There may be a recurrence; we'll h ave to wait five years or more before we can reach a definite conclusion. Moreover we can't be sure that your treatment actually cures cancer unti l we've tried it out on hundreds of other patients and thus can evaluate it s effectiveness.\" I broke in eagerly: \"We can show you hundreds of pe ople who've already taken our treatment and been cured!\" He shook his head impatiently. \"That's not scientif ic proof. We must set up a large-scale experiment under absolute medical controls. Our doctors must select the cases treated so that we're treatin g cancer; they must administer the treatment in order to determine the effective dosage, unfa- vorable reactions etc.; the patients must be kept u nder constant medical observation to ward off the possibility that some o ther factor may account lor their recovery. It's a long-range project invol ving technical skill, hard work and considerable expense.\" * A substance that causes a dry scab to be formed o n skin."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"122 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries He paused significantly. \"Dr. Harris,\" I assured him fervently, \"I'll cooper ate 100 percent in any experiments you care to make with the Hoxsey treatm ent. All I want is the opportunity to prove that it actually cures cancer, and is made available as widely as possible to relieve human suffering.\" He nodded approvingly. Opening a drawer in his desk he produced a sheaf of papers fastened together with a clip and h anded it to me. \"I was sure you'd feel that way about it, so I had my lawy ers draw up a contract. Read it, sign it and we'll get busy at once in sett ing up an organization to handle the experiments.\" There were ten double-spaced, typewritten, legal si zed sheets in the contract. I read slowly, struggling with the involv ed, unfamiliar legal terms. Dr. Harris arose and strolled over to the wi ndow, contemplating the vast expanse of Lake Michigan in the distance. By the time I reached the bottom of the second page I discovered that I was to turn over all the formulas of the Hoxsey t reatment to Dr. Harris and his associates, and relinquish all claims to th em. They would become the personal property of the doctors named in the c ontract. On the following page it specified that I was to mi x and deliver 10 bar- rels of the internal medicine, 50 pounds of the pow der and 100 pounds of the yellow ointment, and instruct a representative of the doctors in the method of mixing these compounds. Farther along I agreed to close my cancer clinic an d henceforth take no active part in the treatment of cancer. My reward for all this was set forth on next to the last page. It appeared that during a ten-year experimental period I would receive no financial remuneration. After that I was to get 10 percent of the net profits. Dr. Harris and his associates would set the fees—and co llect 90 percent of the proceeds. Stunned and appalled by this incredible document, I turned back and reread the principal clauses to make sure my eyes w eren't playing me tricks. There it was, all neatly typed in black and white. The eminent doc- tor turned away from the window, seated himself beh ind his desk and favoured me with a nonchalant smile. \"Well,\" he said heartily, \"I trust it's all clear t o you.\" It was all too clear. He and his friends were tryin g to trick me out of the family formulas, abscond with the fame and prestige attached to the dis- covery of a real cure for cancer, and thereby enric h themselves fabulous- ly at my expense and the expense of millions of hel pless cancer victims. Disillusioned and angry, I could scarcely speak. Fi nally I found my voice. \"Before signing this,\" I said carefully, \"I'd like to show it to a lawyer. Mr. Samuel Shaw Parks, who has offices in the Delaw are Building on"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Alternative Medical Therapies 123 Randolph Street, was my father's attorney. I'll con sult him and be guided by his advice. Perhaps he'll suggest some changes. . ..\" Dr. Harris' smile turned frosty. \"There won't be an y changes,\" he snapped. \"We've set forth the only conditions under which your treatment can be ethically established. Unless you accept the m in their entirety, no reputable doctor will have anything to do with you or your treatment.\" With considerable effort I kept a tight rein on my temper. He has a powerful organization behind him, I kept telling my self. You musn't antagonize him. \"In any case, I'll have to have some time to think over your proposi- tion.\" I stood up. His eyes, friendly as a cobra's, took my full measu re. \"Hoxsey,\" he said levelly, \"until you sign that contract you can't se e Sgt. Mannix again.\" He picked up the telephone, called the hospital, as ked for the superin- tendent, Brother Anthony. \"This is Dr. Harris. Unti l further orders, neither Hoxsey nor Dr. Miller are to be admitted to your ho spital, or to commu- nicate in any way with the patient Thomas Mannix.\" I waited until he hung up the receiver, then seized the telephone and called the Mannix home. Before I could be connected Dr. Harris reached over the desk and tried to take the telephone away from me. My left elbow flipped up, caught him squarely in the chest and se nt him flying into his chair. It promptly toppled over, depositing him in a most undignified posi- tion on the floor. Miss Mannix came on the wire and I explained the si tuation to her. \"If you want your father to get well you'd better get h im out of the hospital and take him home. I'll be over to see him this eve ning and change the dressings.\" She assured me she'd get him home immediately. Dr. Harris picked himself off the floor, his dignit y considerably ruffled, his face as red as a boiled lobster. \"You'll never get away with this!\" he shrilled. \"If you as much as touch that patient I'll have you arrested for practicing medicine without a license. As long as you live you'll never treat can cer again. We'll close down your clinic, run you and that quack doctor of yours out of Illinois. Try and set up anywhere else in this country and yo u'll wind up in jail.\" Without bothering to reply I walked out. Returning to the hotel, I received a telephone call from Dr. Miller. He was in a booth across the street from the Alexian B rothers Hospital, where he'd gone to see our patient. They'd refused to let him in. I explained what had happened at Dr. Harris' office. When I finished , there was a long silence. Finally he sighed: \"Well, that does it.

As my Daddy once told me, there's one thing doctors can't do, and that's put back the cancers we remove. Don't worry about me, Doc. I can take anything they dish out. How about you?\" His voice came back strong over the wire: \"I still say a doctor's first duty is to his patients. I'll string along with you , my boy.\" He waited outside while Kate Mannix, over the stren uous objection of hospital authorities, signed her father out of the institution. When they finally emerged he helped them into a cab and escor ted them home.

Barry Lynes In the summer of 1934 in California, under the ausp ices of the University of Southern California, a group of leading American bacteriologists and doctors conducted one of the first successful cance r clinics. The results showed that: a) cancer was caused by a micro-organism; b) the micro-organism could be painlessly destroyed in terminally ill cancer patients; and c) the effects of the disease could be reversed. The technical discovery leading to the cancer cure had been described in Science magazine in 1931. In the decade followin g the 1934 clinical success, the technology and the subsequent, success ful treatment of can- cer patients was discussed at medical conferences, published in a medical journal, cautiously but professionally reported in a major newspaper, and technically explained in an annual report of the Sm ithsonian Institution. However, the cancer cure threatened a number of sci entists, physicians, and financial interests. A cover-up was initiated. Physicians using the new technology were coerced into abandoning it. The author of the Smithsonian article was followed and then was shot at while driving his car. He never wrote about the subject again. All re ports describing the cure were censored by the head of the AMA (American Medi cal Association) from the major medical journals. Objective scientif ic evaluation by gov- ernment laboratories was prevented. And renowned re searchers who sup- ported the technology and its new scientific princi ples in bacteriology were scorned, ridiculed, and called liars to their faces. Eventually, a long, dark silence lasting decades fell over the cancer c ure. In time, the cure was labeled a \"myth\"—it had never happened. However, do cuments now available prove that the cure did exist, was tested successfully in clinical 126"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Alternative Medical Therapies 127 trials, and in fact was used secretly for years aft erwards—continuing to cure cancer as well as other diseases. BACTERIA AND VIRUSES In nineteenth-century France, two giants of science collided. One of them is now world-renowned—Louis Pasteur. The other, fro m whom Pasteur stole many of his best ideas, is now essentially forgotte n—Pierre Bechamp. One of the many areas in which Pasteur and Bechamp argued concerned what is today known as pleomorphism—the occurrence of more than one distinct form of an organism in a single life cycle . Bechamp contended that bacteria could change forms. A rod-shaped bacterium could become a spher- oid, etc. Pasteur disagreed. In 1914, Madame Victor Henri of the Pasteur Institute confirmed that Bechamp was correct and Pa steur was wrong. But Bechamp went much further in his argument for p leomorphism. He contended that bacteria could \"devolve\" into smalle r, unseen forms— what he called microzyma. In other words, Bechamp d eveloped—on the basis of a lifetime of research—a theory that micro -organisms could change their essential size as well as their shape, depending on the state of health of the organism in which the micro-organi sm lived. This direct- ly contradicted what orthodox medical authorities h ave believed for most of the twentieth century. Laboratory research in re cent years has provided confirmation for Bechamp's idea. This seemingly esoteric scientific squabble had ram ifications far beyond academic institutions. The denial of pleomor phism was one of the cornerstones of twentieth century medical research and cancer treatment. An early twentieth century acceptance of pleomorphi sm might have pre- vented millions of Americans from suffering and dyi ng of cancer. In a paper presented to the New York Academy of Sci ences in 1969, Dr. Virginia Livingston and Dr. Eleanor Alexander-Jacks on declared that a single cancer micro-organism exists. They said that the reason the army of cancer researchers couldn't find it was because it changed form. Livingston and Alexander-Jackson asserted: The organism has remained an unclassified mystery, due in part to its remarkable pleomorphism and its simulation of other micro-organisms. Its various phases may resemble viruses, micrococci , diptheroids, bacil- li, and fungi. THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION The American Medical Association was formed in 1846 but it wasn't until 1901 that a reorganisation enabled it to gain power over how medicine was practised throughout America. By becoming a con federation of state"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"128 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries medical associations and forcing doctors who wanted to belong to their county medical society to join the state associatio n, the AMA soon in- creased its membership to include a majority of phy sicians. Then, by accrediting medical schools, it began determining t he standards and prac- tises of doctors. Those who refused to conform lost their licence to prac- tise medicine. Morris Fishbein was the virtual dictator of the AMA from the mid-1920s until he was ousted on June 6,1949 at the AMA conve ntion in Atlantic City. But even after he was forced from his position of p ower because of a revolt from several state delegations of doctors, the poli cies he had set in motion continued on for many years. He died in the early 1 970s. A few years after the funding of his successful can cer clinic of 1934, Dr. R. T. Hamer, who did not participate in the cli nic, began to use the procedure in Southern California. According to Benj amin Cullen, who observed the entire development of the cancer cure from idea to imple- mentation, Fishbein found out and tried to \"buy in. \" When he was turned down, Fishbein unleashed the AMA to destroy the can cer cure. Cullen recalled: Dr. Hamer ran an average of forty cases a day throu gh his place. He had to hire two operators. He trained them and watc hed them very closely. The case histories were mounting very fast . Among them was this old man from Chicago. He had a malignancy all around his face and neck. It was a gory mass. Just terrible. Just a red gory mass. It had taken over all around his face. It had taken off on e eyelid at the bottom of the eye. It had taken off the bottom of the lowe r lobe of the ear and had also gone into the cheek area, nose and chin. H e was a sight to behold. But in six months all that was left was a little bl ack spot on the side of his face and the condition of that was such that it was about to fall off. Now that man was 82 years of age. I never saw anyth ing like it. The delight of having a lovely clean skin again, just l ike a baby's skin. Well, he went back to Chicago. Naturally he couldn' t keep still and Fishbein heard about it. Fishbein called him in and the old man was kind of reticent about telling him. So Fishbein wined an d dined him and finally learned about his cancer treatment by Dr. Hamer in the San Diego clinic. Soon a man from Los Angeles came down. He had sever al meetings with us. Finally he took us out to dinner and broac hed the subject about buying it. Well, we wouldn't do it. The renown was spreading and we weren't even advertising. But of course what did it was the case histo- ries of Dr. Hamer. He said that this was the most m arvelous develop- ment of the age. His case histories were absolutely wonderful. Fishbein bribed a partner in the company. With the result we were kicked into court for operating without a license. I was broke after a year."},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Alternative Medical Therapies 129 In 1939, under pressure from the local medical soci ety, Dr. R. T. Hamer abandoned the cure. He is not one of the heroes of this story. Thus, within the few, short years from 1934 to 1939 , the cure for can- cer was clinically demonstrated and expanded into c uring other diseases on a daily basis by other doctors, and then termina ted when Morris Fishbein of the AMA was not allowed to \"buy in.\" It was a practise he had developed into a cold art, but never again would su ch a single mercenary deed doom millions of Americans to premature, ugly deaths. It was the AMA's most shameful hour. Another major institution which \"staked its claim\" in the virgin territo- ry of cancer research in the 1930-1950 period was M emorial Sloan- Kettering Cancer Center in New York. Established in 1884 as the first can- cer hospital in America, Memorial Sloan-Kettering f rom 1940 to the mid- 1950s was the centre of drug testing for the larges t pharmaceutical com- panies. Cornelius P. Rhoads, who had spent the 1930s at the Rockefeller Institute, became the director at Memorial Sloan-Ke ttering in 1939. He remained in that position until his death in 1959. Rhoads was the head of the chemical warfare service from 1943-1945, and af terwards became the nation's premier advocate of chemotherapy. It was Dr. Rhoads who prevented Dr. Irene Diller fr om announcing the discovery of the cancer micro-organism to the New Y ork Academy of Sciences in 1950. It also was Dr. Rhoads who arrang ed for the funds for Dr. Caspe's New Jersey laboratory to be cancelled a fter she announced the same discovery in Rome in 1953. An IRS investigatio n, instigated by an unidentified, powerful New York cancer authority, a dded to her misery, and the laboratory was closed. Thus the major players on the cancer field are the doctors, the private research institutions, the pharmaceutical companies , the American Cancer Society, and also the U.S. government through the N ational Cancer Institute (organizing research) and the Food and Dr ug Administration (the dreaded FDA which keeps the outsiders on the defens ive through raids, legal harassment, and expensive testing procedures) . THE MAN WHO FOUND THE CURE FOR CANCER In 1913, a man with a love for machines and a scien tific curiosity, arrived in San Diego after driving across the country from New York. He had been born in Elkhorn, Nebraska, was 25 years old, a nd very happily mar- ried. He was about to start a new life and open the way to a science of health which will be honored far into the future. H is name was Royal Raymond Rife. Close friends, who loved his gentlene ss and humility while being awed by his genius, called h i m Roy."},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"130 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries Royal R. Rife was fascinated by bacteriology, micro scopes and elec- tronics. For the next seven years (including a myst erious period in the Navy during World War I in which he travelled to Eu rope to investigate foreign laboratories for the U.S. government), he t hought about and exper- imented in a variety of fields as well as mastered the mechanical skills nec- essary to build instruments such as the world had n ever imagined. By the late 1920s, the first phase of his work was completed. He had built his first microscope, one that broke the exis ting principles, and he had constructed instruments which enabled him to el ectronically destroy specific pathological micro-organisms. Rife believed that the minuteness of the viruses ma de it impossible to stain them with the existing acid or aniline dye st ains. He'd have to find another way. Somewhere along the way, he made an in tuitive leap often associated with the greatest scientific discoveries . He conceived first the idea and then the method of staining the virus with light. He began building a microscope which would enable a frequency of ligh t to coordinate with the chemical constituents of the particle or micro-orga nism under observation. Rife's second microscope was finished in 1929. In a n article which appeared in The Los Angeles Times Magazine on Decem ber 27, 1931, the existence of the light-staining method was reported to the public: Bacilli may thus be studied by their light, exactly as astronomers study moons, suns, and stars by the light which comes fro m them through telescopes. The bacilli studied are living ones, no t corpses killed by stains. Throughout most of this period, Rife also had been seeking a way to identify and then destroy the micro-organism which caused cancer. His cancer research began in 1922. It would take him un til 1932 to isolate the responsible micro-organism which he later named sim ply the \"BX virus.\" THE EARLY 1930s In 1931, the two men who provided the greatest prof essional support to Royal R. Rife came into his life. Dr. Arthur I. Ken dall, Director of Medical Research at Northwestern University Medical School in Illinois, and Dr. Milbank Johnson, a member of the board of directors at Pasadena Hospital in California and an influential power in Los Angel es medical circles. Dr. Kendall had invented a protein culture medium ( called \"K Medium\" after its inventor) which enabled the \"filtrable vi rus' portions of a bacte- ria to be isolated and to continue reproducing. Thi s claim directly contra- dicted the Rockefeller Institute's Dr. Thomas Riven who in 1926 had authoritatively stated that a virus Deeded a living tissue for reproduction."},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Alternative Medical Therapies 131 Rife, Kendall and others were to prove within a yea r that it was possible to cultivate viruses artificially. Rivers, in his i gnorance and obstinacy, was responsible for suppressing one of the greatest adv ances ever made in medical knowledge. Kendall arrived in California in mid-November 1931 and Johnson introduced him to Rife. Kendall brought his \"K Medi um\" to Rife and Rife brought his microscope to Kendall. A typhoid germ was put in the \"K Medium,\" triple-fi ltered through the finest filter available, and the results examined u nder Rife's microscope. Tiny, distinct bodies stained in a turquoise-blue l ight were visible. The virus cultures grew in the \"K Medium\" and were visi ble. The viruses could be \"light\"-stained and then classified accord ing to their own colours under Rife's unique microscope. A later report which appeared in the Smithsonian's annual publication gives a hint of the totally original microscopic te chnology which enabled man to see a deadly virus-size micro-organism in it s live state for the first time (the electron microscope of later years kills its specimens): Then they were examined under the Rife microscope w here the filter- able virus form of typhoid bacillus, emitting a blu e spectrum color, caused the plane of polarization to be deviated 4.8 degrees plus. When the opposite angle of refraction was obtained by me ans of adjusting the polarizing prisms to minus 4.8 degrees and the cult ures of viruses were illuminated by the monochromatic beams coordinated with the chemical constituents of the typhoid bacillus, small, oval, actively motile, bright turquoise-blue bodies were observed at 5,000 times magnification, in high contrast to the colorless and motionless debri s of the medium. These tests were repeated 18 times to verify the re sults. Following the success, Dr. Milbank Johnson quickly arranged a dinner in honour of the two men in order that the discover y could be announced and discussed. More than 30 of the most prominent m edical doctors, pathologists, and bacteriologists in Los Angeles at tended this historic event on November 20, 1931. Among those in attendan ce were Dr. Alvin G. Foord, who 20 years later would indicate he knew little about Rife's discoveries, and Dr. George Dock who would serve on the University of Southern California's Special Research Committee ov erseeing the clinical work until he, too, would \"go over\" to the oppositi on. On November 22, 1931, The Los Angeles Times reporte d this important medical gathering and its scientific significance: Scientific discoveries of the greatest magnitude, i ncluding a discussion of the world's most powerful microscope recently pe rfected after 14 years' effort by Dr. Royal R.

I. Kendall. Before the gathering of distinguished men, Dr. Kend all told of his researches in cultivating the typhoid bacillus on h is new \"K Medium.\" The typhoid bacillus is nonfilterable and is large enough to be seen eas- ily with microscopes in general use. Through the us e of \"Medium K,\" Dr. Kendall said, the organism is so altered that it ca nnot be seen with ordi- nary microscopes and it becomes small enough to be ultra-microscopic or filterable. It then can be changed back to the m icroscopic or nonfil- terable form. Through the use of Dr. Rife's powerful microscope, said to have a visual power of magnification to 17,000 times, comp ared with 2,000 times of which the ordinary microscope is capable, Dr. Kendall said he could see the typhoid bacilli in the filterable or formerly invisible stage. It is probably the first time the minute filterable (virus) organisms ever have been seen. The strongest microscope now in use can magnify bet ween 2,000 and 2,500 times. Dr. Rife, by an ingenious arrangem ent of lenses apply- ing an entirely new optical principle and by introd ucing double quartz prisms and powerful illuminating lights, has devise d a microscope with a lowest magnification of 5,000 times and a maximum working magnifi- cation of 17,000 times. The new microscope, scientists predict, also will p rove a develop- ment of the first magnitude. Frankly dubious about the perfection of a microscope which appears to transcend the limits se t by optic science, Dr. Johnson's guests expressed themselves as deligh ted with the visu- al demonstration and heartily accorded both Dr. Rif e and Dr. Kendall a foremost place in the world's rank of scientists. Five days later, The Los Angeles Times published a photo of Rife and Kendall with the microscope. It was the first time a picture of the super microscope had appeared in public. The headline rea d, \"The World's Most Powerful Microscope.\" Meanwhile, Rife and Kendall had prepared an article for the December 1931 issue of California and Western Medicine. \"Obs ervations on Bacillus Typhosus in its Filtrable State\" described what Rif e and Kendall had done and seen. The journal was the official publication of the state medical asso- ciations of California, Nevada and Utah. The prestigious Science magazine then carried an ar ticle which alerted the scientific community of the entire nation.

By means of a double reflecting prism built into the instrument, it is possible to turn this plane of vibration in any des ired direction, controlling the illumination of the minute objects in the field very exactly. On December 27, 1931, The Los Angeles Times reporte d that Rife had demonstrated the microscope at a meeting of 250 sci entists. The article explained: This is a new kind of magnifier, and the laws gover ning microscopes may not apply to it. . . Dr. Rife has developed an instrument that may revolutionize laboratory methods and enable bacteri ologists like Dr. Kendall, to identify the germs that produce about 5 0 diseases whose causes are unknown .. . Soon Kendall was invited to speak before the Associ ation of American Physicians. The presentation occurred May 3 and 4, 1932 at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. And there Dr. Thom as Rivers and Hans Zinsser, two highly influential medical men, stoppe d the scientific process. Their opposition meant that the developmen t of Rife's discover- ies would be slowed. Professional microbiologists w ould be cautious in even conceding the possibility that Rife and Kendal l might have broken new ground. The depression was at its worst. The Ro ckefeller Institute was not only a source of funding but powerful in th e corridors of profes- sional recognition. A great crime resulted because of the uninformed, cruel and unscientific actions of Rivers and Zinsse r. The momentum was slowed at the moment when Rife's d iscoveries could have \"broken out\" and triggered a chain react ion of research, clini- cal treatment and the beginnings of an entirely new health system. By the end of 1932, Rife could destroy the typhus bacteria , the polio virus, the herpes virus, the cancer virus and other viruses in a culture and in exper- imental animals. Human treatment was only a step aw ay. The opposition of Rivers and Zinsser in 1932 had a devastating impact on the history of twentieth century medicine. (Zins ser's Bacteriology, in an updated version, is still a standard textbook.) Unfortunately, there were few esteemed bacteriologists who were not frightene d or awed by Rivers. But there were two exceptions to this generally unh eroic crowd.

Welch was the foremost pathologist in America at on e time. The med- ical library at Johns Hopkins University is named a fter him. He rose and said, \"Kendall's observation marks a distinct advan ce in medicine.\" It did little good. By then Rivers and Zinsser were the po wers in the field. Kendall's other supporter was Dr. Edward C. Rosenow of the Mayo Clinic's Division of Experimental Bacteriology. (Th e Mayo Clinic was considered then and is today one of the outstanding research and treatment clinics in the world. The Washington Post of Januar y 6, 1987 wrote, \"To many in the medical community, the Mayo Clinic is ' the standard' against which other medical centres are judged.\") On July 5 -7, 1932, just two months after Kendall's public humiliation, the Mayo Clinic's Rosenow met with Kendall and Rife at Kendall's Laboratory a t Northwestern University Medical School in Chicago. \"The oval, motile, turquoise-blue virus were demons trated and shown unmistakably,\" Rosenow declared in the \"Proceedings of the Staff Meetings of the Mayo Clinic, July 13, 1932, Rochest er, Minnesota.\" The virus for herpes was also seen. On August 26, 1932, Science magazine published Rosenow's report, \"Observations with the Rife Microscope of Filter Passing Forms of Micro-organisms.\" In the article, Rosenow stated: There can be no question of the filtrable turquoise -blue bodies described by Kendall. They are not visible by the o rdinary methods of illumination and magnification . . . Examination un der the Rife micro- scope of specimens, containing objects visible with the ordinary micro- scope, leaves no doubt of the accurate visualizatio n of objects or par- ticulate matter by direct observation at the extrem ely high magnification (calculated to be 8,000 diameters) obtained with th is instrument. Three days after departing from Rife in Chicago, Ro senow wrote to Rife from the Mayo Clinic: After seeing what your wonderful microscope will do , and after ponder- ing over the significance of what you revealed with its use during those three strenuous and memorable days spent in Dr. Ken dall's laboratory, I hope you will take the necessary time to describe how you obtain what physicists consider the impossible. . . . As I visual ize the matter, your ingenious method of illumination with the intense m onochromatic beam of light is of even greater importance than the eno rmously high magnifi- cation . . ."},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Alternative Medical Therapies 135 Rosenow was right. The unique \"colour frequency\" st aining method was the great breakthrough. Years later, after the arrival of television, an associate of the then deceased Rife would explain, \"The viruses were stained with the frequency of light just like colou rs are tuned in on televi- sion sets.\" It was the best nontechnical descriptio n ever conceived. \"BX\" — THE VIRUS OF CANCER Rife began using Kendall's \"K Medium\" in 1931 in hi s search for the cancer virus. In 1932, he obtained an unulcerated b reast mass that was checked for malignancy from the Paradise Valley San itarium of National City, California. But the initial cancer cultures f ailed to produce the virus he was seeking. Then a fortuitous accident occurred. The May 11, 19 38 Evening Tribune of San Diego later described what happened: But neither the medium nor the microscope were suff icient alone to reveal the filter-passing organism Rife found in ca ncers, he recounted. It was an added treatment which he found virtually by chance that final- ly made this possible, he related. He happened to t est a tube of cancer culture within the circle of a tubular ring filled with argon gas activated by an electrical current, which he had been using i n experimenting with electronic bombardment of organisms of disease. His cancer culture happened to rest there about 24 hours (with the cur rent on the argon gas-filled tube), and then he noticed (under the mi croscope) that its appearance seemed to have changed. He studied and t ested this phe- nomenon repeatedly, and thus discovered (cancer vir us) filter-passing, red-purple granules in the cultures. The BX cancer virus was a distinct purplish-red col or. Rife had suc- ceeded in isolating the filtrable virus of carcinom a. Rife's laboratory notes for November 20, 1932, cont ain the first writ- ten description of the cancer virus characteristics . Among them are two, unique to his method of classification using the Ri fe microscope: angle of refraction—12 3/10 degrees; colour by chemical r efraction—purple- red. The size of the cancer virus was indeed small. The length was 1/15 of a micron. The breadth was 1/20 of a micron. No ordi nary light micro- scope, even in the 1980s, would be able to make the cancer virus visible. Rife and his laboratory assistant E. S. Free procee ded to confirm his discovery. They repeated the method 104 consecutive times with identical results. In time, Rife was able to prove that the cancer mic ro-organism had four"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"136 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries forms: 1. BX (carcinoma); 2. BY (sarcoma—larger than BX); 3. Monococcoid form in the monocytes of the blood of o ver 90 per- cent of cancer patients. When properly stained, thi s form can be readily seen with a standard research microscope; 4. Crytomyces pleomorphia fungi—identical morphologica lly to that of the orchid and of the mushroom. Rife wrote in his 1953 book: \"Any of these forms ca n be changed back to 'BX' within a period of 36 hours and will produc e in the experimental animal a typical tumor with all the pathology of tr ue neoplastic tissue, from which we can again recover the 'BX' micro-orga nism. This com- plete process has been duplicated over 300 times wi th identical and posi- tive results. Rife had proved pleomorphism. He had shown how the cancer virus changes form, depending on its environment. He had confirmed the work of Bechamp, of Kendall, of Rosenow, of Welch, and a n army of pleomor- phist bacteriologists who would come after him and have to battle the erroneous orthodox laws of Rivers and his legions o f followers. Rife said, \"In reality, it is not the bacteria them selves that produce the disease, but the chemical constituents of these mic ro-organisms enacting upon the unbalanced cell metabolism of the human bo dy that in actuality produce the disease. We also believe if the metabol ism of the human body is perfectly balanced or poised, it is susceptible to no disease.\" But Rife did not have time to argue theory. He woul d leave that for oth- ers. After isolating the cancer virus, his next ste p was to destroy it. He did this with his frequency instruments—over and over a gain. And then he did it with experimental animals, inoculating them, wat ching the tumours grow, and then killing the virus in their bodies wi th the same frequency instruments tuned to the same \"BX\" frequency. Rife declared in 1953: These successful tests were conducted over 400 time s with experimen- tal animals before any attempt was made to use this frequency on human cases of carcinoma and sarcoma. In the summer of 1934, sixteen terminally ill peopl e with cancer and other diseases were brought to the Scripps \"ranch.\" There, as Rife and the doctors worked on human beings for the f i r s t time, they learned much. In 1953 when Rife copyrighted his book, he made the re al report of what"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Alternative Medical Therapies 137 happened in 1934. He wrote: With the frequency instrument treatment, no tissue is destroyed, no pain is felt, no noise is audible, and no sensation is n oticed. A tube lights up and 3 minutes later the treatment is completed. The virus or bacteria is destroyed and the body then recovers itself natural ly from the toxic effect of the virus or bacteria. Several diseases may be t reated simultaneously. The first clinical work on cancer was completed und er the supervision of Milbank Johnson, M.D., which was set up under a Special Medical Research Committee of the University of Southern Ca lifornia. 16 cases were treated at the clinic for many types of malign ancy. After 3 months, 14 of these so called hopeless cases were signed of f as clinically cured by the staff of five medical doctors and Dr. Alvin G. Foord, M.D., pathol- ogist for the group. The treatments consisted of 3 minutes' duration using the frequency instrument which was set on the morta l oscillatory rate for \"BX\" or cancer (at 3 day intervals). It was found t hat the elapsed time between treatments attains better results than the cases treated daily. This gives the lymphatic system an opportunity to a bsorb and cast off the toxic condition which is produced by the devitalize d dead particles of the \"BX\" virus. No rise of body temperature was percept ible in any of these cases above normal during or after the frequency in strument treatment. No special diets were used in any of this clinical work, but we sincerely believe that a proper diet compiled for the individ ual would be of benefit. Date: December 1, 1953. Other members of the clinic were Whalen Morrison, C hief Surgeon of the Santa Fe Railway; George C. Dock, M.D., interna tionally famous, George C. Fischer, M.D., Children's Hospital in New York; Arthur I. Kendall, Dr. Zite, M.D., Professor of Pathology at Chicago University, Rufus B. Von Klein Schmidt, President of the Univer sity of Southern California. Dr. Couche and Dr. Carl Meyer, Ph.D., h ead of the Department of Bacteriological Research at the Hooper Foundatio n in San Francisco, were also present. Dr. Kopps of the Metabolic Clini c in La Jolla signed all fourteen reports and knew of all the tests from his personal observation. In 1956, Dr. James Couche made the following declar ation: I would like to make this historical record of the amazing scientific won- ders regarding the efficacy of the frequencies of t he Royal R.

RIFE'S APPARATUS, MAGNIFYING 17,000 TIMES, SHOWS GERMS NEVER BEFORE SEEN. November 21, 1931, Special to The New York Times LOS ANGELES, Nov. 21—A description of the world's most powerful microscope recently perfected after f our- teen years' effort by Dr. Royal Raymond Rife of San Diego, was one of the features of a dinner given la st night to members of the medical profession by Dr. Milbank Johnson in honor of Dr. Rife and Dr. Arthur I.

Dr. Rife, by a rearrangement of lenses and by introducing double quartz prisms and illuminating l ights, has devised apparatus with a maximum magnifica- tion of 17,000 diameters. Dr. Kendall told of cultivating the typhoid bacillu s on his new \"medium K.\" This bacillus is ordinarily non fil- terable. By the use of Dr. Rife's microscope, Dr. K endall said, the typhoid bacilli can be seen in the filter able or formerly invisible stage. he had hired this annex for this demonstration over a summer of time.

And I thought to my self, well, nothing can"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Alternative Medical Therapies 139 be done for that. However, they gave him a treatmen t with the Rife fre- quencies and in the course of time over a period of six weeks to two months, to my astonishment, he completely recovered . He got so well that he asked permission to go to El Centro as he h ad a farm there and he wanted to see about his stock. Dr. Rife said, \"N ow you haven't the strength to drive to El Centro.\" \"Oh, yes,\" said he. \"I have, but I'll have a man to drive me there.\" As a matter of fact, the patient drove his own car the re and when he got down to El Centro he had a sick cow and he stayed u p all night with it. The next day he drove back without any rest whatsoe ver—so you can imagine how he had recovered. I saw other cases that were very interesting. Then I wanted a copy of the frequency instrument. I finally bought one of t hese frequency instru- ments and established it in my office. I saw some very remarkable things resulting from it in the course of over twenty years. Note: Biophysicists have now shown that there exist s a crucial natural interaction between living matter and photons. This process is measurable at the cellular (bacterium) level. Other research h as demonstrated that liv- ing systems are extraordinarily sensitive to extrem ely low-energy electro- magnetic waves. This is to say, each kind of cell o r micro-organism has a specific frequency of interaction with the electrom agnetic spectrum. By various means, Rife's system allowed adjusting the frequency of light impinging on the specimen. By some insight he learn ed that the light fre- quency could be \"tuned\" into the natural frequency of the micro-organism being examined to cause a resonance or feedback loo p. In effect, under this condition, it can be said the micro-organism i lluminated itself. Rife extrapolated from his lighting technique, whic h we may be certain he understood, that specific electromagnetic freque ncies would have a negative effect on specific bacterial forms. There can remain no doubt that Rife demonstrated the correctness of his hypothesis to himself and those few who had the courage to look and the perceptual acuity to see! The same new discoveries in biophysics not only explain Rife's principle of illumination; they also explain his process for sel ective destruction of bac- teria. The latter phenomenon is similar to ultrason ic cleaning, differing in delicate selectivity of wave form and frequency. Re cently, researchers whose findings have been suppressed, have caused an d cured cancer in the same group of mice by subjecting them to certai n electromagnetic fields. Rife's work was far more sophisticated. He selected specific micro- scopic targets, and actually saw the targets explod e. A body of recognised scientific evidence now overwh elmingly sup- ports the original cancer theories articulated and demonstrated by Rife fifty years ago. This includes modern AIDS research."},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"140 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries * * * In December of 1931, Dr. Royal Raymond Rife and his colleague, Dr. Isaac Kendal, published their findings in Calif ornia and Western Medicine. The following article describes the outco me of their re- search, as presented to the scientific community. Observations on Bacillus Typhosus in Its Filterable State Arthur Isaac Kendall, Ph.D. and Royal Raymond Rife, Ph.D. Presented at a meeting of the Bacteriological Secti on of the Los Angeles Clinical and Pathological Society, November 20, 1931. It seems improbable that viable bacteria in the fil terable state have ever been unequivocally seen. Nevertheless, the theoreti cal and practical im- portance of filterable forms of bacteria in theoret ical and applied biology cannot be denied. Recently, through the simultaneous availability of the Rife microscope, an instrument combining very high magnification wit h coordinated re- solving power, and a simple procedure for inducing the filterable state in bacteria at will, 1 the possibility of actually demonstrating organism s in this hitherto illusive condition very obviously pre sented itself. Two features of the Rife microscope, full details o f which will be pre- sented elsewhere, must be specifically mentioned he re. First, the entire optical system, including not only the lenses but a lso the illuminating unit, is made of quartz. In addition, a double wedge quar tz prism is mounted between the illuminating unit and the quartz Abbe c ondenser. The latter can be rotated, with vernier control, through 360 d egrees, thereby afford- ing readily controllable polarized light at any req uired angle. The import"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Alternative Medical Therapies 141 of this polarization unit will be discussed later. Inasmuch as this micro- scope magnifies from 5,000 to 17,000 diameters, it is obviously very nec- essary to have it mounted upon an immovable foundat ion. The organism selected for these experiments was the well known Rawlings strain of B. typhosus. The immediate histo ry of the culture used is as follows: October 29, 1931. An agar slant was made of a thric e-plated culture of B. typhosus, Rawlings strain. (Editor's Note: This agar slant was made in the Laboratory of Research Bacteriology, Northweste rn University Medical School, Chicago, Illinois.) November 2, 4 P . M . Inoculated six cubic centimeters of K (protein) Medium 2 from the agar slant culture. November 3,10 A . M . Filtered this culture in K Medium of November 2, through a Berkefeld \"N\" filter. (The culture was di luted with four volumes of sterile physiological saline solution; the vacuu m used was less than four inches of water; the total time of filtration was l ess than ten minutes.) November 3. One drop of filtrate, representing one- fifth drop of the original culture, was introduced into six cubic cen timeters of K Medium. Incubated at 37°C. The filtrate was also tested for purity as follows: (1) cultural reactions; (2) sugar fermentation reaction s; (3) agglutination with specific typhoid serum. All were typical. November 5. The forty-eight-hour culture of Novembe r 3 in K Medium was filtered, as above, through a Berkfeld \"N\" filt er. One drop of the fil- trate was added to six cubic centimeters of K Mediu m and incubated at 37°C. Growth was abundant November 7. November 9. The culture was again transferred to K Medium. November 12. Still another culture was made, in eve ry instance using three loops of culture for the inoculum. It is worthy of note that this thrice filtered cult ure of B. typhosus grew quite readily in K Medium as above outlined: after the second filtration it failed to grow in peptone broth. In other words, th e organism, having become filterable and accustomed to the protein med ia (proteophilic), lost its ability to grow in ordinary peptone . . . The cultures of November 9 and November 12 were exa mined under the microscope and there were no discernible bacill i, although the cultures were markedly turbid. Darkfield illumination reveal ed very small, active- ly motile granules, and direct observation of these with the oil emersion lens confirmed the presence of these motile granule s, without, however, affording any indication of their structure. Theref ore, these granules for obvious reasons could not be unequivocally diagnose d as the filterable form of the bacillus."},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"142 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries In this viable, filtered state the culture was take n to Pasadena, California, and, through the instrumentality of Dr. Milbank Johnson, the cooperation of Dr. Alvin G. Foord, and the courtesy of the Pasadena Hospital, the necessary space and equipment for mou nting the microscope and continuing the cultures were made available. Th e subsequent develop- ments, which are the immediate subject of this disc ussion, are as follows: November 16. The cultures of November 12, made in C hicago, were transferred to fresh K Medium and incubated at 37°C overnight. November 17. The Rife microscope was installed and the first cultures, those inoculated November 16, were examined. The pr eliminary observa- tions of these cultures were made with a polarizing microscope with a spectroscopic attachment. It should be borne in min d that the entire opti- cal system of this micropolarimeter was of quartz. A one-eighteenth-inch apochromatic oil immersion lens was used, with a 20 x quartz ocular. When a culture of B. typhosus in the filterable sta te, grown as above indicated in K Medium was examined with this microp olarimeter, it was observed that the plane of polarization of the ligh t passing through the cul- ture was deviated plus 4.8 degrees, with the simult aneous appearance of a definite blue spectrum. With this observation in mi nd, the culture was next studied with the Rife microscope at 5000 diameters. The double wedge quartz prism referred to above was set by means of the vernier to minus 4.8 degrees. Examined in this polarized light this thrice filtered culture of B. typhosus cultivated i n K (protein) Medium showed small, oval granules, many of them quite act ively motile. These motile granules when in true focus appeared as brig ht turquoise-blue bod- ies, which contrast strikingly, both in color and i n their active motion, with the noncolored, nonmotile debris of the medium. These observations were repeated eight times, using in each instance growth of the filterable organisms in K Medium. The cultures examined were both twenty-four and forty-eight hours old. Th e qualitative results were always . . . the occurrence of small, oval, ac tively motile, turquoise- blue bodies in the cultures and the absence of thes e small, oval, actively motile, turquoise-blue bodies in the uninoculated c ontrol K Media. From the two facts thus far arrived at, namely, tha t the small, oval, turquoise-blue bodies were actively motile and also that they were cul- tivable from K Medium to K Medium, it is surmised t hat these small, oval, motile, turquoise-blue bodies are indeed the filter able forms of the B. typhosus. There is another even more direct procedure for est ablishing the identity of these small, oval, motile, turquoise blue bodies . It has been shown in"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Alternative Medical Therapies 143 previous communications 3 that agar cultures, or better, broth cultures of B . typhosus inoculated into K Medium, become filterabl e within eighteen hours' growth at 37°C. It should follow, inasmuch a s not all of the bacilli appear to become filterable under these conditions, that at least some of the bacilli should have similar turquoise-blue gran ules within their sub- stance if they are indeed passing to the filterable state. Also the free swim- ming filterable forms, the small, oval, motile, urq uoise-blue bodies described above, should be simultaneously present. Darkfield examination of such a culture eighteen ho urs old revealved unchanged, actively motile bacilli, bacilli with gr anules within their sub- stance, and free swimming, actively motile granules . This culture examined in the Rife microscope with the quartz prism set at minus 4.8 degrees and with 5,000 diameters magnification, showed very cle arly the three types of organisms just described, namely: First, unchanged bacilli: These were relatively lon g, actively motile, and almost devoid of color. Second, long, actively motile bacilli, each with a rather prominent gran- ule at one end. The granule in such an organism was turquoise blue, remi- niscent in size, shape, and color of the small, ova l, actively motile, turquoise- blue granules found in the protein medium (K Medium ) where, it will be recalled, no formed (rod shaped) bacteria could be demonstrated. These bacilli having the turquoise-blue granules were col ored only at the granule end, the remainder of the rod being nearly colorles s, in this respect corre- sponding to the unchanged (nonfilterable) bacilli j ust mentioned. Third, free swimming, small, oval, actively motile, turquoise-blue granules, precisely similar, apparently, in size, s hape, and color to those seen in the granulated bacilli just described. From the fact that these small, oval, turquoise-blu e bodies could be seen both in the parent rod and free swimming in the med ium, it is assumed that these small, oval, actively motile, turquoise- blue bodies are indeed the filterable form of B. typhosus.

Fo r it is a sad fact that, these days, in the precincts ruled by the \"arbiters of knowledge,\" disclo- sure of \"unknown\" things, instead of being welcomed with excitement, is often castigated as illusory, or tabooed as \"fantas y.\" Nowhere are these taboos more stringent than in the field of the biom edical sciences and the multibillion dollar pharmaceutical industry with wh ich it interacts. In 1985, Gaston Naessens was indicted on several co unts, the most serious of which carried a potential sentence of li fe imprisonment. His trial, which ran from 10 November to 1 December 198 9, is reported here. When I learned about Gaston Naessens's imprisonment , I left Cali- fornia, where I was living and working, to come to Quebec to see what was happening. I owed a debt to the man who stood a ccused not so much for the crimes for which he was to be legally prose cuted as for what he had so brilliantly discovered during a research lif e covering forty years. To partially pay that debt, I wrote an article enti tled \"In Defense of Gaston Naessens,\" which appeared in the September-O ctober issue of the New Age Journal (Boston, Massachusetts). That artic le has elicited dozens of telephone calls both to the magazine's ed itors and to Naessens himself. Because the trial was to take place in a small Fren ch-speaking enclave in the vastness of the North American continent, I felt it important, as an American who had had the opportunity to master the French language, to cover the day-to-day proceedings of an event of gre at historical impor- tance, which, because it took place in a linguistic islet, unfortunately did not make headlines in Canadian urban centres such a s Halifax, Toronto, Calgary, or Vancouver, not to speak of American cit ies. When the trial was over, Gaston Naessens asked me, over lunch, whether, instead of writing the long book on his fa scinating life and work that I was planning, I could quickly write a shorte r one on the trial based on the copious notes I had taken. He felt it was of great importance that the public be informed of what had happened at the trial. I agreed to take on the task because I knew that a great deal was at stake, not the least of which are the fates of pati ents suffering from the incurable degenerative diseases that Naessens's tre atments, developed as a result of his microscopic observations, have been able to cure.

Freeman Dyson, Disturbing the Universe Early in the morning of 27 June 1989, a tall, bald French-born biologist of aristocratic mien walked into the Palais de Justice in Sherbrooke, Quebec, to attend a hearing that was to set a date for his trial. On the front steps of the building were massed over one hundred demonstra tors, who gave him an ovation as he passed by. The demonstrators were carrying a small forest of p lacards and ban- ners. The most eye-catchingly prominent among these signs read: \"Free- dom of Speech, Freedom of Medical Choice, Freedom i n Canada!\"; \"Long Live Real Medicine, Down With Medical Power!\" ; \"Cancer and AIDS Research in Shackles While a True Discoverer i s Jailed!\"; \"Thank you, Gaston, for having saved my life!\"; and, simpl est of all: \"Justice for Naessens!\" Late one afternoon, almost a month earlier, as he a rrived home at his house and basement laboratory just outside the tiny hamlet of Rock Forest, Quebec, Gaston Naessens had been disturbed to see a swarm of newsmen in his front yard. They had been alerted be forehand—possibly illegally—by officers of the Surete, Quebec's provi ncial police force, who promptly arrived to fulfill their mission. As television cameras whirred and cameras flashed, Naessens was hus- tled into a police car and driven to a Sherbrooke j ail where, pending a pre- liminary court hearing, he was held for twenty-four hours in a tiny cell under conditions he would later describe as the \"fi lthiest imaginable.\" Provided only with a cot begrimed with human excrem ent, the always ele- gantly dressed scientist told how his clothes were so foul smelling after his release on ten thousand dollars bail that, when he returned home, his wife, Francoise, burned them to ashes. It was to that same house that I had first come in 1978, on the recom- mendation of Eva Reich, M.D., daughter of the contr oversial psychiatrist- turned-biophysicist Wilhelm Reich, M.D. A couple of years prior to my visit with Eva, I had researched the amazing case o f Royal Raymond Rife, an autodidact and genius living in San Diego, Calif ornia, who had devel- oped a \"Universal Microscope\" in the 1920s with whi ch he was able to"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Alternative Medical Therapies 147 see, at magnifications surpassing 30,000 fold, neve r-before-seen microor- ganisms in living blood and tissue.* Eva Reich, who had heard Naessens give a fascinatin g lecture in Toronto, told me I had another \"Rife\" to investigat e. So I drove up through Vermont to a region just north of the Canad ian-American border that is known, in French, as \"L'Estrie,\" and, in En glish, \"The Eastern Townships.\" And, there, in the unlikeliest of outba cks, Gaston Naessens and his Quebec-born wife, Francoise (a hospital lab oratory technician and, for more than twenty-five years, her husband's only assistant), began opening my eyes to a world of research that bids fa ir to revolutionize the fields of microscopy, microbiology, immunology, cli nical diagnosis, and medical treatment. Let us have a brief look at Naessens's discoveries in these usually sep- arated fields to see, step by step, the research tr ail over which, for the last forty years—half of them in France, the other half in Canada—he has travelled to interconnect them. In the 1950s, while still in the land of his birth, Naessens, who had never heard of Rife, inven ted a microscope, one of a kind, and the first one since the Californian' s, capable of viewing liv- ing entities far smaller than can be seen in existi ng light microscopes. In a letter of 6 September 1989, Rolf Wieland, seni or microscopy expert for the world-known German optics firm Carl Zeiss, wrote from his company's Toronto office: \"What I have seen is a re markable advance- ment in light microscopy ... It seems to be an aven ue that should be pur- sued for the betterment of science.\" And in another letter, dated 12 October 1989, Dr. Thomas G. Tornabene, director of the School for Applied Biology at the Georgia Institute of Technol ogy (Georgia Tech), who made a special trip to Naessens's laboratory, w here he inspected the microscope, wrote: Naessens's ability to directly view fresh biologica l samples was indeed impressive . . . Most exciting were the differences one could immedi- ately observe between blood samples drawn from infe cted and nonin- fected patients, particularly AIDS patients. Naesse ns's microscope and expertise should be immensely valuable to many rese archers. It would seem that this feat alone should be worthy of an international prize in science to a man who can easily be called a twentieth-century \"Galileo of the microscope.\" With his exceptional instrument, Naessens next went on to discover in * \"What Has Become of the Rife Microscope?,\" New Age Journal (Boston, Massachusetts), 1976. This a r t i c l e has, ever since, been one of the Journal's most requested reprints.

And, strangely enough, this particle was seen by Naessen s to develop in a pleo- morphic (form-changing) cycle, the first three stag es of which—somatid, spore, and double spore—are perfectly normal in hea lthy organisms, in fact crucial to their existence.

They have survived exposur e to 50,000 rems of nuclear radiation, far more than enough to kill any living thing. They have been totally unaffected by any acid. Taken from cen trifuge residues, they have been found impossible to cut with a diamond kn ife, so unbelievably impervious to any such attempts is their hardness. The eerie implication is that the new minuscule lif e forms revealed by Naessens's microscope are imperishable. At the deat h of their hosts, such as ourselves, they return to the earth, where they live on for thousands or millions, perhaps billions, of years! This conclusion—mind-boggling on the face of it—is not one that sprang full-blown from Naessens mind alone. A few y ears ago, I came across a fascinating doctoral dissertation, publish ed as a book, authored by a pharmacist living in France named Marie Noncle rcq. Several years in the writing, Nonclercq's thesis de lved into a long-lost chapter in the history of science that has all but been forgotten for more than a century. This chapter concerned a violent co ntroversy between, on the one side, the illustrious Louis Pasteur, whose name, inscribed on the lintels of research institutes all over the world, is known to all school- children, if only because of the pasteurized milk t hey drink. On the other side was Pasteur's nineteenth-century contemporary and adversary, Antoine Bechamp, who first worked in Str asbourg as a profes- sor of physics and toxicology at the Higher School of Pharmacy, later as professor of medical chemistry at the University of Montpellier, and, later still, as professor of biochemistry and dean of fac ulty of medicine at the University of Lille, all in France. While laboring on problems of fermentation, the bre akdown of complex molecules into organic compounds via \"ferment\"—one need only think of curdling milk by bacteria—Bechamp, at his microscop e, far more primitive that Naessens's own instrument, seemed able to desc ry a host of tiny bodies in his fermenting solutions. Even before Bechamp's time, other researchers had observed, but passed off as unexplainable, what they called \"scintillating corpuscles\" or \"molecular granulations.\" Bechamp, w ho was able to ascribe strong enzymatic (catalytic change-causing) reactio ns to them, was led to coin a new word to describe them: microzymas (tiny ferments). Among these ferments' many peculiar characteristics was one showing that, whereas they did not exist in chemically pure calcium carbonate made in a laboratory under artificial conditions, t hey were abundantly pre- sent in natural calcium carbonate, commonly known a s chalk. For this rea- son, the latter could, for instance, easily \"invert \" [ferment] cane sugar solutions, while the former could not. With the collaboration of his son, Joseph, and Alfr ed Estor, a Mont- pellier physician and surgeon, Bechamp went on to s tudy microzymas"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"150 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries located in the bodies of animals and came to the st artling conclusion that the tiny forms were far more basic to life than cel ls, long considered to be the basic building blocks of all living matter. Bec hamp thought them to be fundamental elements responsible for the activity o f cells, tissues, organs, and indeed whole living organisms, from bacteria to whales, and larks to human beings. He even found them present in life-en gendering eggs, where they were responsible for the eggs' further d evelopment while themselves undergoing significant changes. So, nearly a century before Gaston Naessens christe ned his somatid, his countryman, Bechamp, had come across organisms that , as Naessens immediately recognized, seem to be \"cousins,\" howev er many times re- moved of his own \"tiny bodies.\" Most incredible to Bechamp was the fact that, when an event serious enough to affect the whole of an organism occurred, the microzymas with- in it began working to disintegrate it totally, whi le at the same time con- tinuing to survive. As proof of such survival, Bech amp found these microzymas in soil, swamps, chimney soot, street du st, even air and water. These basic and apparently eternal elements of whic h we and all our ani- mal relatives are composed survive the remnants of living cells in our bodies that disappear at our deaths. So seemingly indestructible were the microzymas tha t Bechamp could even find them in limestone dating to the Tertiary, the first part of the Cenozoic Era, a period going back sixty million yea rs, during which mammals began to make their appearance on earth. And it could be that they are older still—far older . Professor Edouard Boureau, a French paleontologist, writes in his boo k Terre: Mere de la Vie (Earth: Mother of Life), concerning problems of evo lution, that he had studied thin sections of rock, over three billion y ears old, taken from the heart of the Sahara Desert. These sections containe d tiny round coccoid forms, which Boureau placed at the base of the whol e of the evolutionary chain, a chain that he considers might possibly hav e developed in one of three alternative ways. What these tiny coccoid for ms could possibly be, Boureau does not actually know, but, from long stud y, he is sure about the fact they were around that long ago. When I brought the book to Naessens's attention, he told me, ingenu- ously and forthrightly, \"I'd sure like to have a fe w samples of moon rocks to section and examine at my microscope. Who knows, we might find somatid forms in them, the same traces of primitive life that exist on earth!\" Over years of careful microscopic observation and l aboratory experi- mentation, Naessens went on to discover that if and when the immune system of an animal or human being becomes weakened or destabilized, the normal three-stage cycle of t h e somatid goes th rough thirteen of more"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Alternative Medical Therapies 151 successive growth stages to make up a total of sixt een separate forms, each evolving into the next. (See diagram on the so matid cycle.) All of these forms have been revealed clearly and i n detail by motion pictures, and by stop-frame still photography, at N aessens's microscope. Naessens attributes this weakening, as did Bechamp, to trauma brought on by a host of reasons, ranging from exposure to vari ous forms of radiation or chemical pollution to accidents, shocks, depress ed psychological states, and many more. By studying the somatid cycle as revealed in the bl ood of human beings suffering from various degenerative diseases such a s rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, lupus, cancer, and, most recent ly, AIDS, Naessens has been able to associate the development of the forms in the sixteen-stage pathological cycle with all of these diseases. A vi deocassette showing these new microbiological phenomena is available. A mong other things, it shows that when blood is washed to remove all so matids external to the blood's red cells, then heated, somatids latently p resent in a liquid state within the red blood cells themselves take concrete form and go on to develop into the sixteen-stage cycle. \"This,\" says Naessens, \"is what hap- pens when there is immune system disequilibrium.\" I t is not yet known exactly how or why or from what the somatids take s hape. Of the some 140 proteins in red blood cells, many may play a ro le in the process. The appearance of somatids inside red blood cells is th us an enigma as puz- zling as the origin of life itself. I once asked Na essens, \"If there were no somatids, would there be no life?\" \"That's what I believe,\" he replied. . Even more importantly, Naessens has been able to predict the eventual onset of such diseases long before any clinical sig ns of them have put in an appearance. In other words, he can \"prediagnose\" th em. And he has come to demonstrate that such afflictions have a common functional principle, or basis, and therefore must not be considered as sepa rate, unrelated phenom- ena as they have for so long been considered in ort hodox medical circles. Having established the somatid cycle in all its ful lness, Naessens was able, in a parallel series of brilliant research st eps, to develop a treatment for strengthening the immune system. The product he developed is derived from camphor, a natural substance produced by an East Asian tree of the same name. Unlike many medicinals, it is inj ected into the body, not intramuscularly or intravenously, but intralymphati cally—into the lymph system, via a lymph node, or ganglion, in the groin . In fact, one of the main reasons the medical frater nity holds the whole of Naessens's approach to be bogus is its assertion that intralymphatic injection is impossible! Yet the fact remains that such injection is not only possible, but simple, for most people to accomplish , once they are prop-"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"152 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries erly instructed in how to find the node. While most doctors are never taught this technique in medical school it is so ea sy that laypeople have been taught to inject, and even to self-inject, the camphor-derived product within a few hours. The camphor-derived product is named \"714-X\"—the 7 and the 14 refer to the seventh letter \"G\" and the fourteenth letter \"N\" of the alpha- bet, the first letters of the inventor's first and last names, and the X refers to the twenty-fourth letter of the alphabet, which denotes the year of Naessens's birth, 1924. When skillfully injected, 7 14-X has, in over sev- enty-five percent of cases, restabilized, strengthe ned, or otherwise en- hanced the powers of the immune system, which then goes about its nor- mal business of ridding the body of disease. Let us for a moment return to the work and revelati ons of Antoine Bechamp. As already noted, with the fairly primitiv e micorscopic technol- ogy available in Bechamp's day, it was almost incre dible that he was seem- ingly able to make microbiological discoveries clos ely paralleling, if not completely matching, those of Naessens nearly a hun dred years later. We have already alluded to the fact that the microzyma s in traumatized animals did not remain passive, as before, but, on the cont rary, became highly active and began to destroy the bodies of their hos ts, converting themselves to bacteria and other microbes in order to carry ou t that function. While the terminology is not exactly one that Gasto n Naessens would use today, the principles of trauma and of destruct ion of the body are shared in common by the two researchers. Had Becham p had access to Naessens's microscope, he, too, might have establis hed the somatid cycle in all the detail worked out by Naessens. So what happened to Bechamp and his twentieth-centu ry discoveries made in the middle of the nineteenth century? The s ad fact is that, because he was modest and retiring—just like Gaston Naessen s—his work was overshadowed by that of his rival. All of Pasteur's biographies make clear that he was, above all, a master of the art of self -promotion. But, odd as it seems, the same biographies do not reveal any hint of his battle with Bechamp, many of whose findings Pasteur, in fact, p lagiarized. Even more significant is that while Bechamp, as we have seen, cham- pioned the idea that the cause of disease lay withi n the body, Pasteur, by denouncing his famous \"germ theory,\" held that the cause came from without. In those days, little was known about the functioning of the immune system, but what else can explain, for insta nce, why some people survived the Black Plague of the Middle Ages, while countless others died like flies? And one may add that Royal Raymond R i t e ' s microscope, like that of Naessens, allowed him to state unequivocall y that \"germs are not the cause but the result of disease!\" Naessens inde pendently adopted the"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Alternative Medical Therapies 153 view as a result of his biological detective work. The opposite view, which won the day in Pasteur's time, has dominated medica l philosophy for over a century, and what amounted to the creation of a w hole new worldview in the life sciences is still regarded as heretical ! Yet the plain fact is that, based on Naessens's med ical philosophy as foreshadowed by Bechamp and Rife, up to the present time, Naessens's treatment has arrested and reversed the progress of disease in over one thousand cases of cancer (many of them considered t erminal), as well as in several dozen cases of AIDS, a disease for which the world medical community states that there is no solution, as yet. Suffering patients of each sex, and of ages ranging from the teens to bey ond the seventies, have been returned to an optimal feeling of well-being a nd health. A layperson having no idea of the scope of Naessens 's discoveries, or their full meaning and basic implications, might be st be introduced to them through Naessens's explanation to a visiting j ournalist. \"You see,\" began Naessens, \"I've been able to establish a life cycle of forms in the blood that add up to no less than a brand new under standing for the very basis of life. What we're talking about is an entir ely new biology, one out of which has fortunately sprung practical applicati ons of benefit to sick people, even before all of its many theoretical asp ects have been sorted out.\" At this point, Naessens threw in a statement that would startle any biologist, particularly a geneticist: \"The somatids , one can say, are pre- cursors of DNA. Which means that they somehow suppl y a 'missing link' to an understanding of that remarkable molecule tha t up to now has been considered as an all but irreducible building block in the life process.\"* If somatids were a \"missing link\" between the livin g and the nonliving, then what, I wondered aloud in one of my meetings w ith Francoise * Intriguing is a recent discovery by Norwegian mic robiologists. On 10 August 1989, as Naessens was preparing for trial, the world's most prestigious scientific journal, Nature (United Kingdom), ran an article entitled \"High Abundance o f Viruses Found in Aquatic Environments.\" Authorised by Ovind Bergh and collea gues at the University of Bergen, it revealed that, for the first time, in natural unpol luted waters, hitherto considered to have extremely low concentrations of viruses, there exis t up to 2.5 trillion strange viral particles for each litre of liquid. Measuring less than 0.2 micro ns, their size equates to the largest of Naessens's somatids. Much too small for any larger marine organism to ingest, the tiny organ- isms are upsetting existing theories on how pelagic life systems operate. In light of Gaston Naessens's theory that his somat ids are DNA precursors, it is fascinating that the Norwegian researchers believe that the hor des upon hordes of viruses might account for DNA's being inexplicably dissolved in seawater. Ano ther amazing implication of the high viral abundance is that routine viral infection of aquati c bacteria could be explained by a significant exchange of genetic material. As Evelyn B. Sherr, o f the University of Georgia's Marine In s t i t u t e on Sapclo Island, writes in a sidebar art icle in the same issue of Nature: \"Natural genet- ic engineering experiments may have been occurring in bacterial populations, perhaps for eons.\" What connection the aqua-viruses may have wi th Naessens's somatids is a question that may become answerable when Naessens has the opportu nity to observe them at his microscope and compare them with the ones he has already found in vegetal saps and mammalian blood."},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"154 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries Naessens, would be the difference between them and viruses, a long debate about the animate or inanimate nature of whi ch has been going on for years? There was something, was there not, abou t the somatid that related to its nonreliance and nondependence upon a ny surrounding milieu needed by the virus, if it were to thrive. \"Yes,\" agreed Francoise, \"to continue its existence , the virus needs a supportive milieu, say, an artificially created tes t-tube culture, or some- thing natural, like an egg. If the virus needs this kind of support for growth, either in vivo or in vitro—a 'helping hand, ' as it were—the somatid is able to live autonomously, either in a ' living body,' or 'glass- enclosed.' This has something to do with the fact t hat, while the virus is a particle of DNA, a piece of it, the somatid, as we' ve already said, is a 'pre- cursor' of DNA, something that leads to its creatio n.\" To try to get to the bottom of this seemingly revol utionary pronounce- ment, I later asked Francoise to set down on paper some further exposi- tion of it. She wrote: We have come to the conclusion that the somatid is no less than what could be termed a \"concretization of energy.\" One c ould say that this particle, one that is \"initially differentiated,\" o r materialized in the life process, possesses genetic properties transmissible to living organ- isms, animal or vegetal. Underlying that conclusion is our finding that, in the absence of the normal three-stage cycle, no cel lular division can occur! Why not? Because it is the normal cycle that produces a special growth hormone that permits such division. We belie ve that hormone to be closely related, if not identical, to the one di scovered years ago by the French Nobel Laureate Alexis Carrel, who called it a trephone. The best experimental proof backing up this astound ing disclosure, Francoise went on, begins with a cube of fresh meat no different from those impaled on shish kebab skewers. After being injecte d with somatids taken from an in vitro culture, the meat cube is placed i n a sealed vessel in which a vacuum is created. With the cube now protected fr om any contamination from the ambient atmosphere, and anything that atmo sphere might contain that could act to putrefy the meat, the vessel is s ubsequently exposed dur- ing the day to natural light by setting it, for ins tance, next to a window. Harbouring the living, indestructible somatids as i t does, the meat cube in the vessel will, thenceforth, not rot, as it sur ely would have rotted had it not received the injection. Retaining its health y-looking colour, it not only remains as fresh as when inserted into the ves sel, but progressively increases in size, that is, it continues to grow, j ust as if it were part of a living organism. Could a meat cube, animated by s o ma t i d s , if somehow also electrical"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Alternative Medical Therapies 155 ly stimulated, keep on growing to revive the steer or hog from which it had been cut out? The thought flashed inanely throu gh my mind. Maybe there was something electrical about the somatid? B efore I could ask that question of her, Francoise seemed to have already a nticipated it. \"The 'tiny bodies' discovered by Naessens,\" she wen t on, \"are funda- mentally electrical in nature. In a liquid milieu, such as blood plasma, one can observe their electrical charge and its effects . For the nuclei of these particles are positively charged, while the membran es, coating their exteri- ors, are negatively charged. Thus, when they come n ear one another, they are automatically mutually repulsed just as if they were the negative poles of two bar magnets that resist any manual attempt t o hold them together.\" \"Well,\" I asked, \"isn't that the same as for cells, whose nuclei and mem- branes are, respectively, considered to have plus, and minus, electrical charges?\" \"Certainly,\" she replied, \"with the difference that , in the case of the somatids, the energetic release is very much larger . Somatids are actually tiny living condensers of energy, the smallest ever found.\" I was thunderstruck. What, I mused, would the great Hungarian scien- tist Albert Szent-Gyorgyi, winner of the Nobel priz e for his discovery of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) and many other awards, ha ve had to say had he, before his recent death, been aware of Naessens's d iscoveries? For it was Szent-Gyorgyi who, abandoning early attempts to get at the \"secret of life\" at the level of the molecule, had predicted, prior to World War II, when still living and working in Hungary, that such a secret would even- tually be discovered at the level of the electron, or other electrically relat- ed atomic particles!* Probing further into the world of the somatid and i ts link to life's basis and hereditary characteristics, I asked Francoise i f Naessens had done any experiments to show how somatids might produce gene tic effects on liv- ing organisms. \"I'll tell you, now, about one experiment we have r epeated many times,\" she answered, \"whose results are hard for a ny orthodox biologist to swallow. Before describing it, let me add that i t is our belief—as it was also Antoine Bechamp's—that each of our bodily orga ns possesses soma- tids of varying, as yet indescribable, natures that are specific to it alone. But the whole ensemble, the 'family' of these varyi ng forms, collectively circulates, either in the circulatory or the lymph system. On the basis of this experiment, we hold that, as a group, they con tain the hereditary char- acteristics of each and every individual being.\" * For mora recent discoveries relating to the elect rical basis for life, readers are also referred to two fascinating books by Dr. Robert O0.

A s olution containing them is then injected, at a dose of one cubic centimetre per day, into the blood- stream of a rabbit with black fur, for a period of two weeks running. Within approximately one month, the fur of the blac k rabbit begins to turn a grayish color, half of the hairs of which it is c omposed having turned white. In a reverse process, the fur of a white rab bit, injected with soma- tids from a black one, also begins to turn gray. Astonishing as this result, with its \"genetic engin eering\" implications, might be, the effect of such \"somatid transfer\" fro m one organism to another also, said Francoise, produces another resu lt offering great insight into the role played by the somatid in the immunolo gical system. \"When a patch of skin,\" she continued, \"is cut from the w hite rabbit and grafted onto the empty space left after cutting a patch of similar size from the black rabbit, the graft shows none of the signs of rejection that normally take place in the absence of somatid transfer.\" Wha t this might bode for the whole technique of organ transplant, attempts a t which have been bedeviled by the \"rejection syndrome,\" we shall let readers—especially medically trained readers—ponder.

That Naessens was able to make all five discoveries, each in what can be termed its own dis- cipline, might seem to be a feat taken from the ann als of science fiction. And that is exactly the point of view adopted by th e medical authori- ties of the province of Quebec. Worse still, those same authorities have branded Naessens an out-and-out charlatan, calling his camphor-derived 714-X product fraudulent and the whole of his theor y about the origin of degenerative disease and the practice of i t s treatm ent, not to add the rest of his \"New Biology,\" no more th a n \"quackery.\""},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Alternative Medical Therapies 157 Spearheading the attack was Augustin Roy, a doctor of medicine, but one who—like Morris Fishbein, M.D., for many years \"Tsar\" of the American Medical Association—actually practiced med icine for only a brief period of his life. How did a researcher such as Gaston Naessens, endow ed with genius, come to land in so dire a situation? Let us briefly review some of the story of his life and work, about which, during repeated trips to Quebec from the United States, I came to learn more and more. Gaston Naessens was born 16 March 1924, in Roubaix, in northern France, near the provincial capital of Lille, the y oungest child of a banker who died when his son was only eleven years old. In very early childhood, Gaston was already showing precocity as an inventor . At the age of five, he built a little moving automobile-type vehicle ou t of a \"Mechano\" set and powered it with a spring from an old alarm cloc k. Continuing to exhibit unusual manual dexterity, a f ew years later Gaston constructed his own home-built motorcycle, t hen went on to fash- ion a mini airplane large enough to carry him aloft . It never flew, for his mother, worried he would come to grief, secretly bu rned it on the eve of its destined takeoff. After graduation from the College Universitaire de Marcen Baroeul, a leading prep school, Gaston began an intensive cour se in physics, chem- istry, and biology at the University of Lille. When France was attacked and occupied by Nazi forces during World War II, yo ung Gaston, togeth- er with other fellow students, was evacuated to sou thern France. In exile near Nice, he had the highly unusual opportunity to receive the equivalent of a full university education at the hands of prof essors also displaced from Lille. By the war's end, Naessens had been awarded a rare diploma from the Union Nationale Scientifique Francaise, the quasi-o fficial institution under whose roof the displaced students pursued their int ensive curriculum. Un- fortunately, in an oversight that has cost him dear ly over the years, Naessens did not bother to seek an \"equivalence\" from the ne w republican govern- ment set up by General Charles de Gaulle. He thus, ever since, has been accused of never having received an academic diplom a of any kind. Inspired by his teachers, and of singular innovativ e bent, Gaston, es- chewing further formal education—\"bagage universita ire\" [academic baggage] as he calls it—set forth on his own to dev elop his microscope and begin his research into the nature of disease. In this determination, he was blessed by having what in French is called a je unesse doree, or gild- ed childhood—\"born with a silver spoon in his mouth ,\" as the English equivalent has it. His mother afforded him all that was needed to equip his own postwar laboratory at the parental home."},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"158 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries His disillusion in working in an ordinary laborator y for blood analysis spurred Gaston into deciding to go freelance as a r esearcher. Even his mother was worried about Gaston's unorthodox leanin gs. She clearly understood that her son was unhappy with all he had read and been taught. As he was to put it: \"She told me what any mother w ould tell her son: 'It's not you who will make any earth-shaking discoveries , for there have been many, many researchers working along the same lines for decades.' But she never discouraged me, never prevented me from f ollowing my own course, and she helped me generously, financially s peaking.\" Gaston Naessens knew that there was something in th e blood that elud- ed definition. It had been described in the literat ure as crasse sanguine (dross [waste products] in the blood) and Naessens had been able to descry it, if only in a blurry way, in the microsco pic instruments up to then available to him. What was needed was a brand new m icroscope, one that could see \"farther.\" He thought he knew how to buil d one and, at twenty- one, he determined to set about doing so. In the design of the instrument that would open a v ista onto a new bio- logical world, Naessens was able to enjoin the tech nical assistance of German artisans in the village of Wetzlar, in Germa ny, where the well- known German optical company Leitz had been located before the war. The artisans were particularly helpful in checking Naessens's original ideas on the arrangement of lenses and mirrors. The electronic manipula- tion of the light source itself, however, was entir ely of Gaston's own pri- vate devising. When all aspects of the problem seem ed to have been solved, Naessens was able to get the body of his ne w instrument con- structed by Barbier-Bernard et Turenne, technical s pecialists and military contractors near Paris. Readers may fairly ask why Naessens's \"Twenty-first -century\" instru- ment, which has been called a \"somatoscope\" due to its ability to reveal the somatid, has never been patented and manufactur ed for wide use. To understand the difficulty, we should \"fast forward\" to 1964, the year Naes- sens arrived in Canada. Hardly having found his foo ting on Canadian soil, he received a handwritten letter, dated 3 May, from one of the province's most distinguished physicists, Antoine Aumont, who worked in the Division for Industrial Hygiene of the Quebec Minis try of Health. Aumont, who had read about Naessens's special micro scope in the press, had taken the initiative of visiting Naessen s in his small apartment in Duvernay, near Montreal, to see, and see through , the instrument with his own eyes. Aumont wrote: Many thanks for having accorded me an interview tha t impressed me far more than I can possibly describe. I have explained to you why my personal opinions mu st not be con-"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Alternative Medical Therapies 159 sidered as official declarations. But, after thinki ng over all that you showed, and told me, during my recent visit, I have come to unequivo- cal conclusions on the physical value of the instru mentation you are using to pursue your research. As I told you, if my knowledge of physics and mathe matics can be of service to you, I would be very glad to put them at your disposition. It can be deduced that Aumont's enthusiasm for what he had seen caused a stir in the Quebec Ministry of Health, for on 17 July, Naessens received an official letter from that office statin g that the minister was eager to have his microscope \"officially examined\" if its inventor would \"furnish in writing details concerning this apparat us, including all its opti- cal, and other, particularities, as well as its pow ers of magnification, so that experts to be named by the minister can evaluate it s unique properties.\" In reply to this letter, Naessens's lawyer sent a l ist of details as request- ed and stated: \"You will, of course, understand tha t it is impossible for Monsieur Naessens to furnish you, in correspondence , with the complete description of a highly novel microscope which is, moreover, unprotected by any patent.\" Then, to explain why no patent had yet been granted, he added a key phrase: \"since its mathematical constan ts have, up to the pre- sent, not been elucidated in spite of a great deal of tiresome work per- formed in that regard.\" In other words, it seemed t hat Aumont and his col- leagues had been unable to explain the superiority of the microscope in terms of all the known laws of optics and it still seems that, so far, no one else has been able to do so. There have been interesting recent reports on new m icroscopes being developed that apparently rival the magnification p owers of Naessens's somatoscope. It would seem, however, that the 150 a ngstroms of resolu- tion achieved by Naessens's instrument has not yet been matched. The Los Angeles-based World Research Foundation's f lyer, presenting its autumn (1990) conference \"New Directions for Me dicine ... Focusing on Solutions,\" announced the development of an Ergo nom-400x micro- scope, used by a German Heilpraktiker, or healer, B ernhard Muschlien, who paid a visit to Naessens's laboratory in 1985. While his microscope is apparently capable of achieving 25,000-fold magn ification, its stated resolution is 100 nanometres (1000 angstroms), or s everal orders of mag- nitude less than the 150 angstroms developed with t he somatoscope.* In the July 1990 issue of Popular Science, an artic le \"Super Scopes\" refers to an extraordinary new technology in micros copy engineered at Cornell University under the direction of Professor Michael Isaacson, and also in Israel. The technology uses not lenses but apertures smaller than * One nanometre is one-billionth of a metre; one angstrom is ten-billionths of a metre, or one-tenth of a nanometre."},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"160 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries the wave lengths of visible light to achieve high m agnification. Isaacson is quoted as saying: \"Right now, we can get about 4 0 nanometres (400 angstroms) of resolution,\" though he hopes to heigh ten that \"power\" to 100 angstroms \"down the road.\" The 150 angstroms ca pacity built into Naessens's microscope over forty years ago still se ems to lead the field. Returning to the biography of Naessens, during the 1940s, the precocious young biologist began to develop novel anticancer p roducts that had excit- ing new positive effects. The first was a confectio n he named \"GN-24\" for the initial letters of his first and last names, an d for 1924, the year of his birth. Because official medicine had long considere d cancerous cells to be basically \"fermentative\" in nature, reproducing by a process that, while cru- cial to making good wine from grape juice, produces no such salutary effect in the human body, Naessens's new product incorpora ted an \"anti-fermen- tative\" property. The train of his thinking, biolog ically or biochemically speaking, will not be here elaborated lest this acc ount become too much of a \"scientific treatise.\" What can be mentioned is t hat the new product, GN- 24, sold in Swiss pharmacies, had excellent results when administered by doctors to patients with various forms of cancer. As but one example of these results, Naessens cited to me the case of his own brother-in-law, on the executive staff of t he famed Paris subway system, the Metropolitan. In 1949, this relative, t he husband of a now ex- wife's sister, was suffering through the terminal p hase of stomach cancer and had been forced into early retirement. After co mplete recuperation from his affliction, due to GN-24, he resumed work. Only recently, Naessens, who had lost contact with him for years, was informed that he was alive and well. Another 1949 case was that of Germaine Laruelle, wh o was stricken with breast cancer plus metastases to her liver. A ghastly lesion that had gouged out the whole of the left section of her che st had caused her to go into coma when her family beseeched Naessens to beg in treatment. After recovering her health, fifteen years later, she vol untarily came to testify on behalf of Naessens, who, as we shall presently see, had been put under investigation by the French Ordre des Medecins (Med ical Association). She also allowed press photographers to take pictur es of the scars on the left side of her breast-denuded chest. In 1969, twe nty years after her ini- tial treatment, she died of a heart attack. Seeking a more imposing weapon against cancer, Naes sens next began developing a serum. This he achieved by hyperimmuni zing a large draft horse by means of injecting the animal with cancer- cell cultures, thus forcing it to produce antibodies in almost industri al quantities. Blood withdrawn from the horse's veins containing these a ntibodies, when puri- fied, was capable of fighting the ravages of cancel . Itproved to have ther-"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Alternative Medical Therapies 161 apeutic action far more extensive than that obtaine d by GN-24, and led to a restraint or reversal of the cancerous process, n ot only in cases of tumours but also with various forms of leukemia. Ma ny patients clandes- tinely treated by their doctors with the new serum, called Anablast (Ana, \"without,\" and blast, \"cancerous cells\"), were retu rned to good health. One patient, successfully so treated, was to play a key role in Naessens's life. This was Suzanne Montjoint, then just past fo rty years of age, who, in 1960, developed a lump the size of a pigeon's egg i n her left breast. Over the next year, the lump grew as large as a grapefru it. After the breast itself was surgically removed, Montjoint underwent a fifty -four-day course of radiation that caused horrible third-degree burns a ll over her chest. Within six months, she began to experience severe pain in her lower back. Chemical examination revealed that the original can cer had spread to her fifth lumbar vertebra. More radiation not only could not alleviate the now excruciating pain, but caused a blockage in the functioning of her kidneys and bladder. When doctors told her husband she had only a week or so to live, Suzanne said to him, \"I still have s trength left to kill myself . . . but, tomorrow, I may not have it anymore.\" Summoned by the husband, one of whose friends had t old him about the biologist, Naessens began treating Madame Montj oint; who, by then, had lapsed into a semicoma. Within four days, all h er pains disappeared and she had regained clarity of mind. By April 1962 , after an examination of her blood at his microscope, Naessens declared t hat the somatid cycle in Suzanne Montjoint's blood had returned to normal . As she later told press reporters, \"My recovery was no less than a re surrection!\" When these successful treatments, plus many others, came to the atten- tion of French medical authorities, Naessens was tw ice brought before the bar of justice, first for the \"illegal practice of medicine,\" next for the \"ille- gal practice of pharmacy.\" On both occasions, he wa s heavily fined, his laboratory sealed, and most of its equipment confis cated, though, happily, he was able to preserve his precious microscope. With all the harassment he was enduring (while at t he same time sav- ing the lives of patients whose doctors could affor d them little, or no, hope for recovery), Naessens was almost ready to emigrat e from his mother country and find a more congenial atmosphere in whi ch to pursue his work, with the privacy and anonymity that he had al ways cherished and still longs for. An opportunity came when he was in vited by doctors in the Mediterranean island of Corsica, whose inhabitants speak a dialect more akin to Italian than to French. With a long history of occupation by vari- ous invaders before it actually became part of the French Republic, its population has ever since been possessed of a revol utionary streak that, on occasion, fuels an urge toward secession from the \" motherland.\""},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"162 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries In Corsica, Naessens established a small research l aboratory in the village of Prunette, on the southwest tip of the is land. What happened next, in all its full fury, cannot be told here. Re ported in two consecutive issues of the leading Parisian illustrated weekly P aris-Match, the story would require, for any adequate telling, two or mor e chapters in a much longer book. Suffice it to say that, having developed a cure for various forms of degenerative disease, Naessens saw his ivory tower invaded by desperate patients from all over the world who had learned of his treatment when a Scots Freemason, after hearing about it during a Co rsican meeting with international members of his order, leaked the news to the press in Edinburgh. Within a week, hundreds of potential pat ients were flying into Ajaccio, the island's capital, some of them from as far away as Czechoslovakia and Argentina. The deluge immediately unleashed upon Naessens the wrath of the French medical authorities, who began a long invest igation in the form of what is known in France as an Instruction—called in Quebec an Enquete preliminaire—a kind of \"investigative trial\" before a more formal one. All the \"ins and outs\" of this long jurisprudential process, thousands of pages of transcripts about which still repose in of ficial Parisian archives, must, however regretfully, be left out of this narr ative. Its denouement was that Gaston Naessens, together with key components of his microscope preserved on his person, left his native land in 19 64 to fly to Canada, a country whose medical authorities he believed to be far more open to new medical approaches and horizons than those in Franc e. His abrupt depar- ture from the land of his birth was facilitated by a high-ranking member of France's top police organ, the Surete Nationale, whose wife, Suzanne Montjoint, Naessens had successfully treated. Hardly had Naessens set foot on Canadian soil than he was faced with difficulties, in fact a \"scandal,\" almost as, if no t just as, serious as the one he had just left behind. During the French Instruction proceedings in 1964, one Rene Guynemer, a Canadian \"war hero\" of uncertain origin and profession, had accosted Naessens in his Paris home to beg him to c ome to Canada in order to treat his little three-year-old son, Rene Junior, who was dying of leukemia. Though puzzled about a certain lack of \"straightfor wardness\" in the supplicant, Naessens, ever willing to help anyone i n distress, and with the approbation and assistance of the Canadian ambassad or to France, im- mediately flew to Montreal, where he hoped, as agre ed by Guynemer pere, to be able to treat fits in complete discreti on. Upon his arrival at Montreal's Dorval Airport, however, Naessens was ag hast to see a horde"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Alternative Medical Therapies 163 of representatives of both the printed and visual m edia, creating, in antic- ipation of his arrival, what amounted to a virtual mob scene. The Quebec \"Medical College\" had, at the time, agre ed, for \"humani- tarian\" reasons, to allow the treatment of the Guyn emer child, in spite of the fact that Anablast had not been licensed for us e in Canada. Various tests, lasting for several weeks, were made on the product at Montreal's well-known microbiological Institut Armand Frappier to confirm the pres- ence of gamma globulin in it, the presence of which purportedly thorough French examinations had failed to detect. Virtually at death's door, the Guynemer child was s aid to have been given nine injections of Anablast. Naessens himself was n ever given official con- firmation that the injections had actually been adm inistered. Nor was he per- mitted to make any examination of the little patien t's blood at his micro- scope, or even to meet him face to face. After the little boy succumbed, the Quebec press exploded with stories that, in their l uridness matched the ones that had been appearing all over France after the C orsican \"debacle.\" Some of the mysteries of the \"Guynemer connection\" will likely never come to light. Only later did it become clear that the true name of the leukemic child's father was actually Lamer, a man w ho had claimed that, in past years, he had been an officer in the Royal Canadian Air Force and a \"secret agent\" attached to the French \"undergroun d\" during World War II. To the Naessenses, the question has always rema ined: If he was an \"agent,\" then for whom, or for what? In the spring of 1965, Naessens journeyed to France for his trial. When he returned to Quebec in the autumn of that year, h e retired from the pub- lic scene to live incognito in Oka, a Montreal subu rb, with a newfound friend, Hubert Lamontagne, owner of a business sell ing up-to-date elec- tronic devices, whom he had met while looking for e lectrical components for his microscope in 1964. As a person skilled in elec tronics, Naessens was able to be of great assistance to his host, who als o operated a large \"repair shop\" throughout the winter and the following summe r, when, on tour with a troupe of comedians, he was put in charge of solv ing all the acoustical problems in the many provincial cabarets and theatr es hosting the troupe's performances. Deprived, for several years, of any s upport to pursue his life goals, Naessens was constrained to utilize his skil ls as \"Mr. Fixit,\" able to repair almost anything, from automobile engines to rectifiers. After five years of working in electronics, Naessen s had a stroke of luck, perhaps the most important of his career, whe n, in 1971, through a friend, he was introduced to, and came under the pr otective wing of, an \"angel\" who saw in Naessens the kind of genius he h ad for a long time been waiting to back. That \"'angel\" was the late David Stewart, head of M ontreal's presti-"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"164 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries gious MacDonald-Stewart Foundation, which for many years had funded, as it still continues to fund, orthodox cancer rese arch. Despondent about the recent death from cancer of a close friend, and in serious doubt that any of the cancer research he had so long supported would ever produce any solution, Stewart's guiding precept and motto w as \"In the search for a remedy for cancer, we shall leave no stone unturn ed.\" The philanthropist therefore decided personally to back Naessens's res earch. But after setting up a laboratory for the biologist on the Ontario St reet premises of the well known MacDonald Tobacco Company, which Stewart's fa ther had inher- ited from its founder, tobacco magnate Sir William MacDonald, David Stewart came under such violent criticism by leader s of orthodox can- cerology that he advised Naessens to move his resea rch to a low-profile provincial retreat. Having, by that time, established a \"liaison\" with his bride-to-be, Francoise Bonin, whose parents lived in Sherbrooke, Naessens was, by 1972, able to take over the elder Bonin's summer ho use on the banks of the Magog River in Rock Forest, \"winterize\" it, and establish a well equipped laboratory in its basement. And there, the Naessenses, who were married in 1976, have ever since been located. Of h is wife, Naessens has said to me: She was persuaded from the very start about the int rinsic value of my research and at once saw the truth of it. Just as t hen, so now, years later, she continues her loyal assistance to get th is truth out. Some ask if it's moral support. Yes, it could be called that . We have the same kind of attitudes about things. Both of us, for instance , believe that if some- thing new produces good results, it's got to be pur sued to the bitter end. This is not ambition, but moral honesty. When one g ets to know her, one realizes that she doesn't just repeat the things I think and say, but is con- vinced about them because of what she has seen and experienced. Because legal restrictions applying to foundations and their grants pre- vented David Stewart from transmitting monies direc tly to Naessens, the foundation director arranged for them to be funnele d via the Hotel Dieu— a leading hospital affiliated with the Universite d e Montreal that special- izes in orthodox cancer treatment and research. Acc used by Augustin Roy as a \"quack,\" Naessens has consequently had his wor k modestly funded by checks made out by a hospital at the heart of on e of Canada's cancer establishment's most prestigious fund-granting inst itutions. No more anomalous a situation exists anywhere in the worldw ide multibillion-dol- lar cancer industry. Given the importance of the foundation's assistance , it is all the more curious that Augustin Roy had not made the slightes t mention of the foun-"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Alternative Medical Therapies 165 dation's loyal support of the biologist over the ye ars. Instead, at a press conference held after Naessens's arrest to present traditional medicine's case against Naessens, Roy, perhaps unknowingly, de monstrated the \"Catch-22\" that any alternative medical, research, or frontier scientist faces. Roy stated that if Naessens were a \"true\" sc ientist he would have long since submitted his results to proper authorit ies for check, but when asked by journalists whether the Quebec medical com munity had thor- oughly investigated the biologist's claims, Roy ins crutably replied, \"That's not our job.\" In answer to another reporter 's query about the asser- tions of many cancer patients that the Naessens tre atment had completely cured their affliction, Roy added, \"I just can't un derstand the naivete and imbecility of some people.\" To get a more complete idea of the full impact of R oy's attitude with respect to a brand new treatment and patients benef iting from it, we here excerpt some of his additional statements made duri ng an interview on McGill University's Radio Station in the summer of 1989. When, to open the interview, Roy was asked his opin ion about what the interviewer termed a \"remarkable new anticancer pro duct, 714-X,\" the medical administrator replied, \"I have been aware o f Monsieur Naessens for twenty-five years. In 1964, he arrived from Fra nce with a so-called cancer treatment, Anablast, the very same medicinal he's now using under another name—714-X.\" That anyone in a position as elevated as Roy's coul d publicly propagate so obvious an error is surprising. For Anablast, wh ich, as we have seen, is a serum, has nothing to do with 714-X, a biochemica l product. Yet here was the head of the Quebec medical establishment fa lsely stating that 714- X, developed over thirteen years in Canada, was not hing but the older French product bearing a new name, a statement tire lessly, and erro- neously, repeated by journalists in the press. As for Naessens himself, Roy told his radio audienc e: \"That man's pro- fessional knowledge is equal to zero! You should kn ow that he has, behind him, in France, an imposing, even 'heavy,' past inv olving serious judicial procedures and condemnations.\" It seems truly amazi ng that a doctor who, over a quarter of a century, had never met Nae ssens, or once visited his laboratory, or taken the trouble to investigate why hundreds of cancer patients had survived because of his new treatment, could so peremptori- ly reduce the biologist's knowledge to nil. Was Roy really being impartial when he said, \"I've got to be a bit care- ful because Naessens is currently under legal prose cution ... But the fact remains that he was in serious trouble with the Fre nch legal authorities. Let's just say he's a 'slick talker,' one who knows how to address an audi- ence. But, I ask you, why is it that he's been work ing in secret for so"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"166 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries long?\" In asking this question, Roy was obviously n ot in the least ashamed to be adding a second error to the one he h ad already propagat- ed. For the truth was, and is, that Naessens, far f rom having worked \"in secret\", has at all times—as I have repeatedly witn essed over the years— kept his laboratory open to \"all comers\" and has st ood ready to discuss his research with any of them. \"It's so obvious,\" Roy d isparagingly contin- ued, \"that all this man's affirmations and allegati ons just don't have a leg to stand on . ..\" \"But,\" ingenuously interrupted his young interviewe r, \"haven't there been several people who have testified in writing, or on TV, that they've been cured by 714-X?\" Roy's unhesitating answer was breathtakingly catego ric: \"No one's per- sonal testimony has any value whatsoever! All such testimonies are pure- ly suggestive and anecdotal. Let's show a little co mmon sense, after all! Common sense indicates that if Naessens had a real treatment for a mala- dy such as cancer, it would have been criminal not to put it at the disposi- tion of the whole world! I don't understand what he 's up to, and I have even less understanding of those who go about publi cizing his reputed treatment, which is pure quackery.\" Given the hyper bole on Roy's part, one could well wonder what hope there might be for any kind of new dis- covery in the health field ever to become authorize d, or even known. For years, Naessens had been assiduously, but unsuccess fully, trying to \"put his discovery at the world's disposition.\" Unabashed by the weight of her interviewee's author ity, the interview- er was not loath to press in on Roy again: \"There h ave, however, been cer- tain doctors who have been most surprised at how te rminal patients have been brought back to good physical shape with 714-X . Would that not make anyone eager to verify the facts with respect to those recovered patients?\" \"Not at all!\" Roy's rejoinder was a virtual explosi on. \"It's not my job, or that of the Medical Corporation, to check on pse udocures of that kind! So what, if two, three, four, or half a dozen docto rs, in their isolation, have something good to say in support of it? No matter w here they come from, their statements are worthless!\" To get a countervailing idea of what Naessens might have said in rebut- tal in Roy's presence, we shall next excerpt part o f an interview with the biologist by the same interviewer on the same radio station a few days later. \"Gaston Naessens,\" she began, \"is your 714-X really effective?\" Naessens: Absolutely! It builds up the immune syste m so that all the body's natural defenses can regain the upper hand. I don't make the claim"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Alternative Medical Therapies 167 in a void, because there are a lot of people around who were gravely ill with cancer who can now state they have gotten well due to my treatment. Interviewer: If your product really works, why hasn 't Dr. Roy been inter- ested in doing an in-depth study of it? Does he kno w you at all? Naessens: Many people have asked me both those ques tions. If you ask him the latter question, he will pull out a thick f ile on me and he'll tap it, and say, \"Sure, I've known him since 1964.\" But the fact is he has never met me in person, never visited my lab, and never i nvestigated my work! So, he is absolutely incapable of making any judgme nt whatsoever on whether that work has a solid foundation, or not! In his lengthy reply, uninterrupted by the fascinat ed interviewer, Naes- sens, after a brief pause, began to reveal the esse nce of the difficult situa- tion in which he had been placed over the years: Naessens: Let's get to the heart of this matter: Th e medical community, on the one hand, and I, on the other, speak complet ely different languages. That anomaly connects to the important fact that al l approved anticancer therapies are focused only on cancer tumours and ca ncerous cells. The reigning philosophy, medically speaking, is that a cytolytic (cell-killing) method must be used to destroy all cancer cells in a body stricken with that disease. But I, on the contrary, have developed a therapy ba sed on what has been called the body's whole terrain! To understand that, you have to real- ize that, every day, our bodies produce cancerous c ells in no great amount. It's our healthy immune system that gets rid of the m. My 714-X allows a weakened, or hampered, immune system to come back t o full strength, so that it can do its proper job! If medical \"experts\" pronounce my product worthless , it might even be admitted that, in terms of their own scientific phi losophy, they are making some sense. This is largely because, when they exam ine my product for any cytotoxic effect it might have, they find none! Interviewer: Is the Medical Corporation interested in sitting down and talking with you, or running tests to verify your p roduct? Naessens: No! Because they firmly believe that any success it might have is due to some kind of \"psychological\" effect, and they say that the prod- uct i t s el f contains nothing that could possibly be of benefit."},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"168 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries Interviewer: Where did they get that idea? Naessens: It seems that, with officialdom, it's alw ays a case of misinfor- mation, or of bad faith. If this whole affair were limited to patients I've successfully treated, patients who might have remai ned silent, I would still have small hope that my research will one day be recognized. But, now, a crucial turning point has been reached. I'm back in the interna- tional limelight. My arrest, incarceration, and ind ictment are important if only because, immediately following them, people \"i n the know\" have begun to take action on my behalf. That being so, t he medical communi- ty's negative reaction is no longer the only, or th e dominant, one! It may be too bad that all this has to be thrashed out not in a scientific forum, but in a court of law. But that's the way it is. In my upcoming trial, many of my patients' cases will be examined, one by one, an d exposed in full detail, in the courtroom! So the medical \"authoriti es\" will no longer be the sole judges. After continuing on with this theme for several min utes longer, Naessens came to a firm conclusion: \"I wouldn't want you to think that I'm even trying to boast when I say that my work represents a brand new horizon in biology! I have found a successful way of adjust ing a delicate biologi- cal mechanism. I have no pretensions beyond that! I f I can be of service to anyone, my laboratory is always open.\" Gaston Naessens was brought to trial in Quebec, whe re he was acquitted and completely exonerated."},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"Dr. Max Gerson's Nutritional Therapy for Cancer and Other Diseases Katherine Smith The story of Doctor Max Gerson and the nutritional therapy he developed for cancer and other diseases is another sad chroni cle of the suppression of a therapeutic programme which has the power to h elp—if not cure— many people who would otherwise suffer continuing i llness and death. Born in 1881 and raised in Germany, Dr. Gerson bega n the develop- ment of his nutritional therapy in an effort to fin d relief from the crippling migraine headaches from which he suffered as a youn g man. Working on a hunch that a chemical imbalance in his body might be responsible for the painful headaches which plagued him, Gerson dec ided to alter his diet and see if his condition improved. After trying a m ilk-based diet, using the rationale that milk was the primary food of mammals , he tried treating himself with a diet comprised mainly of raw foods, and found that his migraine headaches disappeared. Dr. Gerson then tri ed out the therapy on those of his patients who suffered from migraines, and found that they too found relief, and this painful condition disappeare d. One of the people Dr. Gerson treated for migraine h eadaches also suf- fered from lupus vulgaris—a so-called \"incurable\" d isease. To Gerson's surprise, not only did this patient's migraine atta cks disappear after begin- ning the nutritional therapy, but his lupus was als o healed. Dr. Gerson successfully treated other people suffer ing from lupus with his diet therapy. Then, since lupus vulgaris is als o known as tuberculosis of the skin, Gerson had the inspiration to begin tr eating people suffering from other forms of tuberculosis. In 1933, he publi shed his book, Dietary Therapy of Lung Tuberculosis. Unfortunately, the ri se of Hitler to power in Germany meant that he was unable to publicly dem onstrate his discov- eries to the Berlin Medical Association. Paced with a deteriorating politi- cal situation in his homeland Dr. Gerson went to wo rk in Vienna and 169"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"170 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries France, as well as giving lectures throughout Europ e. Finally, as the clouds of war gathered ever more ominously over Eur ope, Gerson left Europe in 1936 to begin a new life in America. Unfortunately for Dr. Gerson—not to mention the tho usands upon thousands of people who could have been helped by h is therapy—the U.S., while a haven from Hitler, was far from being the land of the free. Gerson found that publishing his work—which was a r elatively easy proposition in Europe—was an almost impossible task in the United States. Perhaps part of the reason why Gerson's work was no t enthusiastically supported by his medical peers in the United States may have been that he was German, and therefore to be treated with suspic ion, as a member of an enemy nation, even though he had qualified to pr actise medicine in the United States in 1938. However, a more important re ason was that his treatments for cancer challenged the orthodox metho ds. In the 1930s and 1940s, according to the orthodox mind-set, cancer w as to be treated in two basic ways: surgically to remove the offending tumo ur (when it was oper- able) and then with radiation to kill the cancerous cells. Dr. Gerson's conception of cancer went far beyond m erely viewing the cancer as a spontaneous eruption within a healthy b ody. Rather he saw cancer as the end result of generalised degradation of the bodily systems, especially the liver. Such concepts were quite fore ign to the vast majority of the medical profession at that time, when doctor s could not adequately account for the cause of cancer, nor inform people how to avoid this life threatening disease. According to Gerson, the way to prevent cancer was by \". . . prevent- ing damage to the liver. The basic measure of preve ntion is not to eat the damaged, dead, poisoned food which we bring into ou r bodies. Every day, day by day, we poison our bodies.\" Gerson's nutriti onal therapy worked on the principle that in order to cure a serious di sorder such as cancer, treatment of the symptoms of the disease was not su fficient to restore the patient to health. He wrote in his book A Cancer Th erapy: Results of Fifty Cases in 1958 that the \"whole body\" or \"whole metab olism\" had to be treated to \"correct all the vital processes\" in ord er to effect a cure. The basis of Dr. Gerson's nutritional programme to strengthen the body to allow healing to take place is a diet comprised mostly of raw foods, especially freshly-made fruit and vegetable juices, green salad, and a soup cooked at a very low heat. Some cooked fruit and ve getables are also per- mitted in the first six weeks of his dietary plan. However, no canned, salt- ed, pickled, bleached, sulphured, frozen or smoked foods in short no denatured foods of any kind—are permitted at any ti me during the Gerson regime."},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Alternative Medical Therapies 171 The therapy Dr. Gerson devised was also designed to be high in potas- sium and low in sodium. The soup mentioned above is especially high in potassium, which helped to correct a too-high ratio of sodium to potassi- um suffered by many people with cancer, especially those with moderate or advanced cancer. Dr. Gerson discovered that rest oring a favourable potassium/sodium balance could reverse some of the cell damage caused by an excess of sodium. The function of the freshly-made fruit and vegetabl e juices in the pro- gramme is to detoxify the body and provide oxidisin g enzymes to assist in the rehabilitation of the liver. Other technique s to support the liver and detoxify the body are also used in the programme, i ncluding coffee ene- mas to stimulate the flow of bile and safely dispos e of toxins, the juice of raw calves' liver, and injections of crude liver ex tract. (Liver juices and extracts are no longer used by people following a G erson programme in the 1990s, due to the contamination of the liver wi th pesticides and bac- teria. Spirulina and carrot juice may be taken inst ead to provide nutrition- al iron and pro-vitamin A. Desiccated liver tablets may be used instead, since these are thought to contain fewer toxins.) Gerson also supplemented the diet of people in his care with addition- al potassium salts, as well as organic and inorgani c iodine. Fluoride-con- taminated water or other products are forbidden bec ause of fluoride's tox- icity to valuable enzymes. Animal fats are excluded . Dr. Gerson's pro- gramme was originally completely free of fats and o ils (excluding the small amount of fat present in the calves' liver), but after experimentation, Gerson modified his programme to include a small am ount of flax seed oil to supply essential fatty acids. After six weeks of detoxification using the diet an d supplements out- lined above, patients in Gerson's care graduated to a diet which included small amounts of the protein foods such as yogurt, cottage cheese, and natural buttermilk. (Foods containing protein had b een previously restrict- ed to allow the body adequate time to detoxify and begin to break down tumour tissue.) These, then, were the basic theories and therapy wh ich Dr. Gerson had developed by the time that he came to the United St ates in 1936. In January 1948—almost twenty years after he had first successfully treated cancer in Germany in 1928—he went to work at New Yo rk's Gotham Hospital. However, Gerson's efforts to publish his discoveries consistent- ly met with a negative response from the publishers of medical journals. His article \"Cancer, A Deficiency Disease\" was reje cted by the New York State Journal of Medicine in 1943. The next ye ar another paper, \"Dietic Treatment of Malignant Tumours,\" was also r ejected by every medical journal to which it had been sent. In 1945, he finally succeeded"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"172 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries in publishing \"Dietary Considerations in Malignant Neoplastic Disease,\" which appeared in the November-December edition of Review of Gas- troenterology. His work might have been destined to obscurity forever, but for an investigative reporter who discovered th e good doctor working quietly to cure cancer with his most unorthodox the rapies, and determined to bring Dr. Gerson's life-saving discoveries to pu blic attention. Raymond Swing, an ABC radio journalist, proposed th at Dr. Gerson be called to testify before the Senate which was debat ing a bill to allocate funds for cancer research. Raymond Swing's efforts on Dr. Gerson's behalf were successful and the doctor, together wit h five of his patients, went before a sub-committee of the Senate in 1946 a nd told their stories. All of the five patients had had a positive respons e to Dr. Gerson's thera- py, and had been told by their former doctors that there was no longer any hope for them. They included: a woman with breast c ancer who had undergone mastectomy and radiation treatments to no avail. Her cancer had disappeared after nine months of the Gerson the rapy; a fifteen year old girl had been paralysed by a tumour in her spin al cord. Her tumour had vanished after 8 months of Gerson therapy; a soldie r with an inoperable tumour which had grown from his neck into his skull , making radiation treatment impossible because of the risk of brain d amage—a year after commencing the Gerson therapy he was completely fre e of cancer; and a woman who had suffered from a malignant sarcoma. Pr ior to beginning the Gerson therapy, she had large tumours in her gr oin, neck and abdomen. After a year on the Gerson therapy she was complete ly free of cancer. Unfortunately, Dr. Gerson's successful treatment of these and other patients who otherwise had been doomed to die did n ot earn him the respect and recognition from the medical community that he deserved. Quite to the contrary. The public display of Dr. Ge rson's successful but unorthodox treatment of cancer victims further alie nated him from main- stream medicine. An abusive editorial in the Journa l of the American Medical Association in November 1946 followed Dr. G erson's appear- ance in front of the Senate sub-committee. The edit orial celebrated the unfortunate fact that, despite the amazing and incr edibly newsworthy results of Dr. Gerson's therapy, his presentation b efore the Senate sub- committee had received \"little, if any newspaper pu blicity\"—as if the lack of mainstream publicity itself was an indictment of the treatment! The edi- tor further denigrated his work by splitting hairs as to what precisely con- stituted a \"cure.\" Dr. Gerson, he wrote, \"admits la ck of any actual cure, claiming only that patients seemed improved in heal th and that some tumours were delayed in growth or became smaller.\" In one final coup against Dr. Gerson, who for years had been submitti ng work to the jour- nal for publication without success, he wrote that \"the journal has on sev-"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Alternative Medical Therapies 173 eral occasions requested Dr. Gerson supply details of the method of treat- ment but has thus far received no satisfactory repl y.\" This editorial was just the beginning of a concentr ated campaign of harassment against Dr. Gerson and the people who we re working with him in his Research Foundation. Between 1946 and 19 54, Dr. Gerson was investigated five times by the Medical Society of t he County of New York. After each investigation, the Research Founda tion requested that the investigators give a statement, and in each case th e request was denied. However, in 1948, Dr. Gerson and his Research Found ation were left in no doubt as to what the medical establishment th ought of them when a review of their work was published in the Journal o f the AMA. The review was entitled \"Frauds and Fables,\" in which the jour nal suggested that Gerson was a fraud. The Research Foundation threate ned to sue the AMA and were able to stop reprints of the damaging arti cle. However, as a con- sequence of the damaging publicity, Gotham Hospital refused to allow Dr. Gerson to work on its premises after 1950. Moreover, Dr. Gerson was not able to restore his go od name within the medical profession in America. It became impossible for him to publish a single piece of research in any medical journal fro m the end of 1949 until the end of his life, despite (or perhaps because of ) his thousands of suc- cess stories. In addition, Gerson was prevented fro m presenting patients at a hearing of the House of Commerce Committee in 195 3, which was investigating therapies for cancer and other diseas es. Despite requests from his patients that he be allowed to present his findings, as well as a letter from Dr. Gerson himself, the chairman of the committee failed to offer Dr. Gerson the chance to demonstrate his find ings. With his work increasingly under fire in the United States, Dr. Gerson went to Europe in order to publish his discoveries. A German journal, Medizinische Klinik, published two of the reports w hich U.S. journals had refused to print: \"Cancer: A Problem of Metabolism\" and \"No Cancer in Normal Metabolism.\" He was also invited to the Univ ersity of Zurich in 1952, after attending the International Cancer Cong ress in Berchtesgaden. When Dr. Gerson returned to the United States from Europe, however, he faced still more hurdles. In 1957, he was invest igated by the Licensing Board of New York State. Even more damaging to his work, his malprac- tice insurance was terminated. In 1958 Gerson was s uspended from the Medical Society of the State of New York, and the l aboratories which Dr. Gerson's Research Foundation used for X-rays, blood , and urine analyses were warned that should they continue to do work fo r Dr. Gerson and his patients, they would be put out of business. Dr. Ge rson died in 1959. The harassment of Dr. Gerson by the medical establi shment, while both unethical and immoral, is understandable within a c ommercial context. If"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"174 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries Gerson's methods of curing cancer had replaced the \"conventional\" can- cer treatments, the profession's investment in expe nsive equipment such as surgical facilities and radiation treatment appa ratus would have been lost, to say nothing of prestige. However, it was not just Dr. Gerson and his colleag ues who had to endure harassment. Patients who sought out the Gers on treatment in pref- erence to orthodox medicine were also harassed by m embers of the ortho- dox medical community. In many cases, doctors haran gued patients so persistently that they abandoned Gerson's therapy—e ven when it appeared to be helping them—and accepted convention al medical treat- ment for their cancer. These tactics compelled Gers on to write to a close friend in 1957 that: The most difficult and inhuman part of the measures taken against me is that the physicians approach the best and almost completely cured patients and try to have them returned to their hos pitals. Here they man- age with orthodox treatments to kill them. I lose i n this manner some- where between 25 and 30 percent of my best cases. This sort of harassment of people using the Gerson therapy occurred even after Dr. Gerson's death, with doctors going a s far as phoning pa- tients in residence at the La Gloria Hospital in Me xico, which was set up in 1977 to provide Dr. Gerson's therapy on an in-pa tient basis. In 1998, the climate of mainstream medical hostilit y towards Dr. Gerson's unorthodox therapy programme has not changed. \"Anti -quackery\" laws forbid the practise of the Gerson therapy in Califo rnia and other states of the U.S. by medical doctors. People with cancer who reject the options of surgery, radiation and chemotherapy offered to them by the major cancer hospitals must either struggle to pursue a Gerson-t ype programme in their own homes without adequate medical support, or find the money neces- sary to travel to Mexico and pay for treatment at L a Gloria Hospital, near Tijuana. The parents of a growing number of children with ca ncer are even less able to choose what they believe is the most suitab le treatment option for their son and daughter, since by law all children i n the United States who have cancer must be given chemotherapy, or their pa rents may be impris- oned. Even a demonstrable improvement in the child' s condition using non-toxic methods of cancer treatment will not fore stall the application of this barbarous law. Gerson's therapy remains on the \"Unproven Methods L ist\" of the American Cancer Society, despite ample evidence in Dr. Gerson's book A Cancer Therapy: The Results of Fifty Cases, as well as testimony from former cancer patients whose cancerous conditions h ave been healed by"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Alternative Medical Therapies 175 Gerson's techniques. Dr. Gerson's therapy has now b een practised for over 60 years, and patients of La Gloria Hospital e xperience an average improvement rate of 80 percent in early to moderate cancer and even more amazingly a 40-50 percent rate of improvement in pe ople with so-called \"terminal\" cancer. Other benefits of the Gerson the rapy for cancer suffer- ers included a marked reduction in pain, and also c ontrol of the acute infections which often led to the death of cancer p atients. (The clinic does however, have a general rule of not accepting peopl e who have previous- ly undergone chemotherapy, since due to the damage that chemothera- peutic drugs inflict upon the liver and other organ s of the body, sustained improvement in the condition of these cancer patien ts is much less likely. The medical director has also stated that people wi th tumours which have spread into the brain and begun to damage the delic ate regulatory mecha- nisms within it are also less likely than most pati ents to respond to the Gerson treatment.) In 1995, the Gerson Research Association and the Ca ncer Prevention and Control Program of the University of California published the results of a fifteen-year retrospective study which evaluat ed the success of Gerson therapy in treating malignant melanoma. The results of this study showed that people with m elanoma who used Gerson therapy survived longer than people using co nventional therapy. One most encouraging finding was that 100 percent o f 14 people with stage I and II (localized melanoma) survived for fi ve years, compared to 79 percent of 15,798 people who did not follow the Gerson program. For people with melanoma classified as IIIA and III B (regionally metas- tasized), 70 percent of 33 Gerson patients lived fo r five years, compared to 41 percent of 134 melanoma patients under the ca re of the Fachklinik Hornheide. Of those patients with melanoma which had metastasi zed to distant lymph nodes, skin areas or subcutaneous tissue—39 p ercent of 18 Gerson patients were alive after five years. By comparison , just 6 percent of 194 patients under the care of the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group sur- vived five years. Despite these impressive results of Dr. Gerson's th erapies, mainstream medicine is even less receptive to his ideas and tr eatment plans now than when he began publishing the results of his work in the United States in the 1940s. In January 1945, the then manager-director of the A merican Cancer Society Mr. C. C. Little wrote (to a doctor): It seems to me that since Dr. Gerson has frankly st ated in detail what his diet is and in addition has given the theory on which he personally"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"176 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries believes its claimed efficacy is based, that his ma terial should receive publication and proper attention and criticism by t he medical profession. I sincerely hope it will be possible to arrange thi s. When both the American Cancer Society and the Natio nal Cancer Institute were approached about the Gerson therapy in the 1980s howev- er, both organisations denied having even seen a co py of A Cancer Therapy: The Results of Fifty Cases, despite the fa ct that due to the hero- ic efforts of Dr. Gerson's daughter, Charlotte Gers on Strauss, the land- mark book has remained in print for 40 years. In 19 84, the American Cancer Society, along with the House of Representatives Se lect Committee on Aging declared that the \"Gerson method of treating of cancer is of no value.\" Although the \"Unproven Methods List\" is updated eve ry six months, Gerson's therapy is not likely to be deleted from t he list in the near future. The Unproven Methods Committee, according to the di rector of the Unproven Methods Office, G. Congdon Wood, supposedl y makes its deci- sions on the medical literature. More recent inform ation which supports his therapies, such as that published in the 1978 J ournal of Physiological Chemistry and Physics seems to have been ignored—a spokesperson for the ACS explaining that they \"had not seen\" the art icle. Government agencies such as the FDA. are also consu lted in the review process. Unfortunately for people's health, the FDA . is notorious for its prejudice against vitamins and other natural therap ies. When Charlotte Gerson Strauss was attempting to find a publisher f or her father's book, some of the publishing houses considering the book received threats from the FDA, which had recently (May 1992) made a raid on the Tahoma (nat- ural health) Clinic in Washington State, and seized vitamins and patient records, among other things. It is obviously not th e sort of agency you would expect to endorse Gerson's therapy any time i n the near future. The National Cancer Institute is another agency tha t gives the Committee information about therapies on the Unprov en Method's List. This agency long ago rejected Dr. Gerson and his wo rk. Would you rea- sonably expect a prestigious national institute to sully its good name as the Castle of the Valiant Knights in White Coats battli ng the twentieth century scourge of cancer by associating with a \"quack\" who was expelled from his own State Medical Society? Hardly."},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"Section II The Suppression of Unorthodox Science The history of science is hardly the history of fre e inquiry. Rarely does science engage in self-examination, whether scienti fically or simply re- flectively. Occasionally we may benefit from the pe rspectives of those observers and historians from outside this branch o f knowledge, who seek to bring to the world some solid wisdom. More frequ ently they fail to awaken interest within a rigid system that believes , as Organized Science does, that all mistakes were committed in the past. (\"We might have got it wrong with Galileo and Semmelweis, but that was the n.\") Seldom is truth met with unconditional acceptance in professions th at are not renowned for their engaging humility and willingness to embr ace information that conflicts with their cherished and well-defended be liefs. And so Freud was leaned on to radically alter his s eduction theory. Under duress from colleagues, he lost concern for t he welfare of sexually abused and beaten children. Rather, from 1894 onwar d he helped to found a system that blames the victim, turning his origin al thinking on its head—it's the children who try to seduce the parent s! Only then could he find acceptance in the Viennese community of psycho logists who then launched him on his stellar career. Freud's case was not isolated. Wilhelm Reich's book s were publicly burned by the FBI in a New York City incinerator in 1957; Immanuel Velikovsky's work was trashed by the U.S. scientifi c establishment, his publisher leaned on to offload his contract—in the middle of a bestseller; and Julius Hensel's pioneering work on \"rock dust\" fertiliser was sup- pressed by the NPK people who had something big to sell the world. So what if everyone is now lacking in essential trace minerals as a result? Pat Flanagan's Neurophone patent was confiscated by the U.S. govern- ment and held for fourteen years—for \"national secu rity reasons\"—while this most brilliant of brilliant American scientist s was starved out.

Are these examples mere abberations in an otherwise inclusive organi- zation, or is there is a system-wide suppression sy ndrome? And if sup- pression is the norm in our supposedly objective sc ientific establishment, what exactly have we lost? I believe that we will p robably never know what we have lost, or at least the extent of the lo ss. That's because who we become is a reflection of the attenuation of our available options by a system in which greed is valued above the human cre ative potential, and even the life force itself. This system's natural r esponse is to suppress that which threatens its stake in the status quo. Science is funded by giant corporations that do not have a vested inter- est in, say, organic agriculture, water as a fuel, or good nutrition and san- itation as ways of improving health rather than vac cinations and antibi- otics. Science is not pure, nor has it ever been. T he \"Scientific Method\" exists only for the purpose of censoring the innova tions of independent thinkers. The unconventional scientist, the person who comes up with something that threatens a billion dollar industry, will find him or herself either very rich or very dead. Or possibly both. Still, some co urageous souls do try, despite the risks, to make their knowledge public. These truly great re- searchers and inventors are the pure scientists—the ones with a better idea, a new periodic table, a fresh perspective in looking at the universe, a cure for cancer. They represent thousands of othe r free thinkers who remain anonymous because their ideas and inventions have been bought up, suppressed, forgotten. Common sense dictates that the quality of life of t he human population would be greatly improved if only good ideas would triumph in a free marketplace of ideas. But there is no existing free marketplace of ideas, and so good ideas do not triumph in the end. Thus it seems that, despite the vigorous protests of skeptics and others who profit from existing condit ions, the evidence would indicate that suppression is the norm. The current reality of a world in which creativity and independent thinking are stifled portends a dismal future. Is t here any hope with a view like this one? Perhaps not. But then, perhaps it is up to us to change our outlook for the years to come."},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"Science as Credo Roy Lisker It seems to me that there are too many people in to day's intellectual agar- agar who discovered at some early stage that they c ould feather their nest egg by the interminable cranking of a handful of de pendable algorithms in obsessive-compulsive fashion in the same way as the Hindu peasant chews his betel-nuts, the cracker-barrel philosophe r his wad of chaw, or the elderly Jewish housewife in Miami Beach her bag of sunflower seeds—and thereby concluded that any real effort to wards a higher spiri- tual or cultural life is a waste of time. For a great deal of science is nothing more than su ch forms of compul- sive cud-chewing. Truly original ideas are few; man y famous scientists have built their entire careers on one or two ideas . In mathematics (the science with which I have the g reatest familiarity), those who developed two original and entirely uncon nected trains of thought are given special mention in the bibliographies and histories of the science: Bernhard Riemann, for work in both complex variable s and differential geometry; or Gauss for work in number theory, proba bility and physics. Really independent ideas are difficult to come by i n any field—and by \"idea\" I mean something like \"evolution\" or \"the sq uare root of minus one,\" or \"the atom.\" Consider Thomas Hardy, capping a successful career as a novelist with a second career as a poet. Servi ng us as the exception which proves the rule, his poetry, though much of i t is of a high quality, is monotone in its affect of dreary gloom. He is fond, for example, of griev- ing the miseries of children who aren't even born y et! Most scientific work, to return to the point, is me chanical, methodical, repetitive and dull. A person may turn out several hundred papers in his lifetime of work without the grace of a single idea worthy of the name.

A few months ago, I attended a poetry reading given by a Czech poet/neurophysiologist Miroslaw Holub, at the Lamon t Library of Harvard University. I liked his poetry quite a bit; I am sure he is a good neuro (etc.), and know him also as a prominent acti vist in the years between Dubcek and Havel. Commenting on the differe nces between lit- erary theory and scientific work, Holub related thi s conversation between Paul Valery and Albert Einstein. Valery asked Einstein: \"Albeit, answer me this: Whe n you get a new idea, do you run to your notebooks to write it down as fast as you can before it's forgotten?\" To which Einstein replied: \"In our profession, Paul, a new idea arises so very rarely, that one is not l ikely to forget it, even years later.\" To support my thesis that the scientists of the mod ern world are in no sense the torchbearers of true civilization, but ar e little different (in the majority) than the brain-dead scholastics of the Mi ddle Ages, I have iden- tified a Credo of thirteen articles resembling the dogmatic catechisms of various cults and creeds, such as the words of the Mass, the laws of Leviticus, the Nicene Creed, the Benedictine Rule, the Confessions of Faith, the Book of Common Prayer, and the like: THE SCIENTIST'S CREDO I. That research be its own justification, whether its purpose be noble, silly or malevolent. We see this in particular in research on animal sub jects, however there are many examples to be taken from all the sciences . The truism that many discoveries which were useless at the time they wer e made turned out to be of some use, even a century or two later, has, i n our day, been elevat- ed into the above principle, which asserts that \"Al l research must be valu- able because it may be useful.\" Such an argument wo uld, in the older reli- gious credos, be equivalent to an exhortation to mo nks to commit murder because they might find something which, thirty yea rs later, will give them some good reasons to instruct novices in the e vils of murder. II. That there are hidden laws of Nature which guar antee that the fruits of all research must ultimately be of benefit to manki nd. This is a stronger version of Article I, however, t he emphasis here is on the \"hidden laws,\" which posit a kind of ultimate \" Moral Essence,\" or"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Unorthodox Science 181 \"Unconditioned Virtue\" in research. There has been no attempt, as far as I know, made by anyone to discover these laws or to derive them from raw data. I may myself approach the NSF [Nation Science Foundation] to underwrite a few decades of Research to validate or invalidate the belief that Ultimate Goodness lies at the bottom of All Re search. III. That the unbelievable amounts of suffering inf licted on living creatures, including human beings, through research in biology , medicine, psycholo- gy, and related Sciences, have been as necessary to our Salvation as tor- turings were necessary to the Salvation of the vict ims of the Inquisition. The definition of salvation changes from one era to the next, but the facts of power and sadism undergo little alteration . As long as there exist so many highly qualified professionals in respected fields who enjoy caus- ing suffering to the helpless, it matters little th at they toil in this service of some given creed or another one. Ten minutes of rat ional judgement could easily cancel 50 percent of all the experiments in which living creatures are subjected to such horrible tortures. (It is my belief that this figure can be raised to 100 percent, but that constitutes anot her essay.) Still, there is no arguing with Salvation. IV. That there exists a well-defined methodology kn own as the \"Scientific Method,\" and that every intelligent person not only knows what it is, but has exactly the same idea of what it is. We are here confronted with yet another classical b arge before the tug- boat dilemma: the standard definition of intelligen ce as that mental factor which understands and uses the \"Scientific Method.\" The vulgar defini- tion of this method, that which is adhered to by mo st members of the sci- entific community, is some dreary mix of Positivism and Empiricism. Positivism claims that Universals can be proven by the accumulation of Particulars, while Empiricism claims that facts, an d facts alone, are self- evident. In point of fact, this author knows quite a large n umber of intelligent people who don't buy either of these viewpoints, bu t they are also not among the legions who recite the Credo every mornin g upon rising. V. That science is not responsible for its creation s. We all know that Szilard, Fermi, Ulam, Oppenheimer, etc., didn't make the A-bomb: God made the A-bomb. One is reminded of the famous remark of Pope Clement II in the fifteenth century, when he was asked how he and his friends might, in good faith, throw all the gold plates used during their daily feast through the windows of the Vatican and into the Tiber River, while at the same time most of Europe was starving: \"God made the papacy; it's our business to enjoy it .\""},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"182 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries VI. That science has absolute control over its crea tions. Most of us go to sleep secure in the knowledge that genetic engineers are following all those guidelines (that they, in t heir superior wisdom also established), and that therefore Godzilla will not spring out of a test tube, at least not while we're alive. It might appear to the discerning that Principles V and VI cannot both be true: yet that is the nature of true religion, w hich cannot be imagined without paradox and contradiction! Read, for exampl e, Rudolph Otto's \"The Idea of the Holy.\" VII. That the lifelong gratification of idle curios ity must produce all the raptures experienced by the mystics of the Middle A ges. What indeed is this much jubilated \"Scientific Meth od,\" if not the prom- ise of some delectation of infinite and perpetual b liss in the discovery, for example, that (Catalan's Conjecture) the Diophantin e Equation, xy - uv = 1, has only one non-trivial solution in integers, name ly x = 3, y = 2, u = 3; or that the uncovering of counter-examples, if there a re any, would require more computer capacity than that presently available ove r the entire planet! Alas, that Plotinus, Meister Eckhart, Heinrich Suso , Thomas a Kempis, St. John of the Cross, and so many others were not born in our glorious age of scientific faith, so that they might achieve union with the Ultimate Reality through computing 20 million roots of the R einmann Zeta on the line s = 1 + iy, or through bashing in the brains o f a thousand monkeys to learn about head injuries, or through counseling th e world for more than half a century that it must find some way of copula ting with its mothers to achieve psychological health, or through using t he inhabitants of Bikini Atoll as guinea pigs for the study of radiation sic kenss, or through elabo- rating very complex and involuted theories with no experimental basis, no predictive power, and hardly any theoretical purpos e, such as string theo- ry in particle physics. Twenty years of wasted effort in the elaborate gymn astics of string the- ory must be worth, in the free market, at least a d ozen visions of the Virgin Mary in tenth century gold crowns. VIII. That Science is value-free. Most of these abominations are justified, sooner or later, by arguments to the effect that Science is unable to determine v alues. There is, in other words, a limit even to the great powers of the Scie ntific Method. A book of matches is also value-free; this hardly give us the right to use it for the purposes of burning down someone's house. The \"ultimate benefit\" argument, and the \"value-fre e\" argument are frequently employed by the same official personages , usually in the same paragraph."},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Unorthodox Science 183 IX. That Science is the highest value. The metaprinciple that there is no contradiction in contradictory prin- ciples, is invoked with a high frequency in all org anized religions; and, as a religion, Science is nothing if not organized, pe rhaps the most highly organized in the history of organized religion. One can well imagine, for example, that the author of this essay, sick unto d ying from the gangrene of functional employment, would derive quite a lot of satisfaction and a good income by joining the ranks of Walter Sullivan , James Gleick, Gina Kolata, Isaac Asimov and so on, by writing a scienc e column for some magazine or daily newspaper. This is indeed true, the trouble being that he is u nable to pay homage to the drivel demanded by the Religion of Science, a s piritually emaciated cult worship of such universal acceptance that \"science writing,\" \"science prose- lytizing,\" and \"science worship,\" are inseparable i n the public consciousness. The Article of Faith which requires us to believe t hat \"Science,\" as a metaphysic and mass opiate, is the highest and most enduring value, has prevailed over the past two centuries so that it ha s turned almost all of our schools and colleges, and certainly all of our big universities, into either technical schools or research institutes. Things ha ve changed very little since twelfth-century Sorbonne, when Theology was l ord of all, and all other intellectual endeavors had to go begging. It is only the name of the game which is different. In today's schools, Philosophy has been reduced to an inane obsession with sententious doubt. Letters apologizes for its very existence. There's no money in an English degree, and the teaching of Languages for any profession outside the diplomatic corps has fallen to such a low level that even the pampered scientists of our day are in dang er of losing their grasp on the scientific treasures of the past five hundre d years, almost all of which were written in Latin and Greek—indeed, scien tists in today's America can't even speak a good French, German or R ussian, something unimaginable seventy years ago. Culture is ridiculed with a sorry yawn; mathematici ans, physicists, biologists, or even chemists who imagine themselves on the slashing edge of knowledge will make comments about modern art, m usic or poetry that a poor lonesome cowboy, far from the centers of lea rning and art, would be ashamed to utter.

This myopic view of history also fails to understand that the kind of world that Science has created for us, and the kind of spiritual desert it wishes all of us to liv e in, is driving hundreds of thousands, millions of the \"ignorant\" into the arms of these simplistic, foolish, backward yet in so many ways more spiritua lly enriching faiths, such as Creationism, which people like Sagan and St ephen Jay Gould waste their time in hating and fearing.

(I am indebted for this example to Dr. Andreas Ehre nfeucht, at the University of Colorado.) We know that the father of the theory of Drifting Continents, Hans Wegner, was ridiculed and ignored throughout most of his scientific career for his belief in this theory . Imagine today, however, that there is a geologist w ho for lots of good reasons believes that this theory is false. He would probably be given much the same treatment that Galileo received, less brutal in its methods, perhaps, but with exactly the same results: a black-listing and a silencing. XII.

Freud considered that his paper, ent itled \"The Aetiology of Hysteria,\" was of the utmost importance, since i t proposed what he believed to be an irrefutable cause for the neurose s suffered by many of his patients. Quite simply, when listening sympathe tically to his women patients, Freud had heard that as children they had suffered sexual assaults, and he believed that it was these acts of violence which had led to the victims' mental illness later in life. The point of the paper was that sexually abused chi ldren, many of whom had come from \"respectable\" middle class homes , displayed sig- nificant \"hysterias\" later on in life—an observatio n that today would pass as obvious to the point of banality, but something that in 1896 provoked a backlash among Freud's older colleagues. All the strange conditions under which the incongru ous pair continue their love relations—on the one hand the adult, who cannot escape his share in the mutual dependence necessarily entailed by a sexual rela- tionship, and who is at the same time armed with co mplete authority and the right to punish, and can exchange the one role for the other to the uninhibited satisfaction of his whims, and on the o ther hand the child, who in his helplessness is at the mercy of this arb itrary use of power, who is prematurely aroused to every kind of sensibi lity and exposed to every sort of disappointment, and whose exercise of the sexual per- formances assigned to him is often interrupted by h is imperfect control of his natural needs—all these grotesque and yet tr agic disparities dis- tinctly mark the later development of the individua l and of his neurosis, with countless permanent effects which deserve to b e traced in the greatest detail."},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Unorthodox Science 187 In fact, as author and former Freud Archives Direct or Jeffrey Masson discussed at some length in his controversial bests eller The Assault On Truth: Freud's Suppression Of The Seduction Theory (Farrar Straus and Giroux, 1984), the pressure that was brought to bea r on Freud was strong enough to make him change his mind completely about the validity of the sexual assault theory. In a dramatic about-face, he formulated his \"seduc- tion theory,\" in which children themselves became t he seducers rather than the victims. Freud's inaugural paper, \"The Aetiology of Hysteria \" was singled out from all the other papers presented in Vienna in 18 96 as the one paper that was not published in the \"Wiener Klinische Wochensc hrift,\" the peer journal for the newly forming school of psychoanalysis. Unl ike all the other papers delivered, there was no summary and no discussion o f Freud's work. According to Masson, Freud wrote a letter to his cl ose friend Wilhelm Fliess that \"A lecture on the aetiology of hysteria at the Psychiatric Society met with an icy reception . . . and from Kr afft-Ebing the strange comment: It sounds like a scientific fairy tale. An d this after one has demonstrated to them a solution to a more than thou sand year old prob- lem, a 'source of the Nile.'\" According to Masson, \"The prospect of being ostraci zed by medical society was negligible in the face of his knowledge that he had discovered an important truth.\" At this point Freud believed w hat his patients were telling them, namely that they had been sexually as saulted, usually by their fathers, but sometimes by their mothers, and were living in shame and pain and self-loathing. ... The behaviour of patients while they are reprod ucing these infantile experiences is in every respect incompatible with t he assumption that the scenes are anything less than a reality which i s being felt with dis- tress and reproduced with the greatest reluctance. Masson states that Freud went to some pains to asse rt his own objec- tivity and admitted that \"he too had to overcome re sistances before accepting the unpalatable truth,\" and was therefore somewhat prepared for his colleagues' negative reaction to his paper. When the reaction did come it was swift and severe, and conveyed the impression that unless Freud recanted, his future a s a psychotherapist would be in jeopardy. \"I am as isolated as you could wish me to be: the w ord has been given out to abandon me, and a void is forming around me, \" Freud wrote to Fleiss.

If the reader feels inclined to shake his head at my credulity, I cannot altogether blame him . In fact Freud went so far as to say that \"... I was at last obliged to rec- ognize that these scenes of seduction had never tak en place, and that they were only fantasies which my patients had made up.\" In other words, his patients had lied to him, and he had been naive to believe them. Rather than having been victims of sexual advances from th eir parents, they had made up stories \"to cover up the recollection of in fantile sexual activity ...\" He continues: \"The grain of truth contained in this fantasy lies in the fact that the father, by way of his innocent caress es in earliest childhood, has actually awakened the little girl's sexuality ( the same thing applies to the little boy and his mother).\" According to Masson, \"giving up his 'erroneous' vie w allowed Freud to participate again in a medical society that had earlier ostracized him. In 1905 Freud publicly retracted the seduction theory. By 1908, respected physicians had joined Freud: Paul Federn, Isidor Sa dger, Sandor Ferenczi, Max Eitingon, Karl Jung. . . . The psychoanalytic m ovement had been born but an important truth had been left behind.\" When Masson went on to publish his beliefs about wh y Freud had abandoned the seduction theory, the psychoanalytic community did not at all take kindly to his indictment of the foundation s of Freudian psycho- analysis. The Assault On Truth became itself the ob ject of derision and pressure from the psychoanalytic community which re fused to believe the evidence that Masson was publishing. The first indication of trouble ahead came from Fre ud's daughter, Anna Freud, who voiced her displeasure when Masson began pressing her for the reasons why the letters quoted above had never been published. But the full fury of the psychoanalytic establishment w as to come after the publication of preliminary papers divulging the aut hor's discoveries, par- ticularly those surrounding Freud's studies at the Paris Morgue in the 1880s. There he was likely to have witnessed autops ies performed on chil- dren who had been sexually mutilated and murdered b y adults. What Masson was doing in his research for The Assau lt On Truth was nothing less than uncovering evidence so damning th at it called into ques- tion the whole foundation of psychoanalysis itself. Anna Freud virtually admitted that she had deleted her father's crucial letters dealing with the seduction theory and childhood rape. Masson wrote:"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Unorthodox Science 189 I began to notice what appeared to be a pattern in the omissions made by Anna Freud in the original, unabridged edition. In the letters written after September 1897 (when Freud was supposed to ha ve \"given up\" his \"seduction\" theory), all the case histories dea ling with sexual seduc- tion of children were excised. When Masson's book was finally published, he was al ready cast out, and the reason is obvious: He was accusing Freud, t he founder of psy- choanalysis, of having sold out. Moreover, I believe that Freud is largely responsible for. . . having given intellec- tual sophistication to a wrong view (that women inv ent rape) [and] for the perpetuation of a view that is comforting to ma le society. He was also saying that the doctrines of modern psy choanalysis rest on a very shaky foundation indeed: The psychoanalytic movement that grew out of Freud' s accommodation to the views of his peers holds to the present posi tion that Freud's ear- lier position was simply an aberration. Masson was attacked, as he says, with more vitriol and personal \"ad hominem\" arguments than he was with anything substa ntive, and he wound up taking to court one reviewer, Jill Malcolm and her magazine, The New Yorker, in a famous libel suit—which he won . Robert Goldman, writing in The California Monthly, would probably h ave agreed with the decision when he wrote: . . .

The Third Reich wanted these inventions developed quick ly. But the inven- tor took his time; understandably he did not want t o give Hitler a tech- nological advantage. The Austrian, Viktor Schauberger, was known in his time as the Water Wizard.

His stubborn certainty angered academics who assume d superiority over a largely self-educated man. It is not surpris ing that he was some- times abrasive; the Schauberger heritage included d efiant courage. His ancestors were privileged Bavarian aristocracy with a manor named Schauburg, and in the thirteenth century this ancie nt family lost its royal privileges by publicly defying a powerful Bishop. IN TUNE WITH NATURE A few centuries later, about 1650 A . D ., a family member moved to Austria and began a branch of the Schaubergers which specia lized in caring for forest and wildlife. Breathing the scent of sun-war med pines, generations of Schaubergers then lived their family motto of fi dus in silvis silentibus— faithful to the silent forests. Viktor's father was master woodsman in Holzschlag at Lake Plockenstein, and Viktor absorbe d accumulated wis- dom of generations of forest wardens. His mother al so taught him to tune in to nature—to listen to its singing in a mountain stream as well as its whispering through the treetops, and to learn its c ycles and rhythms. The family's closeness to their environment was not only on a spiritu- al or poetic level; it was based on practical obser vations. For example, Viktor's elder relatives respected a certain vigour which they found in cool unpolluted water. So, instead of irrigating me adows in warm sunlight when the water was sluggish, they spent moonlit nig hts lifting gates on their irrigation canals so that the liveliest [most life-giving] water would flow onto their land. It grew noticeably more grain and grasses than did the neighbouring lands. From childhood Viktor aspired to be a forest warden like his father, grandfather and a line of great-grandfathers. As a boy he explored nearby woods and then roamed farther. He came to know the rumbling rivers and the musical streams which feed them, just as other young people know streets and hallways and sounds of their childhood. However, he noticed that natural waterways rarely flowed in straight co rridors. Instead, a river undulates through the landscape, swerving to one si de and then to the other. Within the larger meandering caused by Earth 's turning, water coils around a twisting central axis as it sweeps downstr eam. Keeping in mind this inward-spiralling motion, Schauberger later de veloped the basis for a technology in tune with nature. When Viktor reached university age, his father want ed him to t r a i n as"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Unorthodox Science 193 an arboriculturist. The young man resisted the pres sure to limit his outlook to the academic viewpoint. He quit university, but later did graduate from forest school with state certification as a forest warden, and then appren- ticed under an older warden. Throughout his life he continued to learn, from books and wise observers as well as directly f rom nature. ROYAL GAMEKEEPER Schauberger had the opportunity—rare in this centur y—of living for years in a vast unspoiled forest. After the First World W ar ended, Prince Adolf von Schaumburg-Lippe hired him to guard 21,000 hect ares [51,870 acres] of mostly virgin forest in a remote district. As he patiently observed rhythms of life in this huge watershed, Schauberger saw phenomena which may be impossible to find today. One terrifyi ng example, which in the end impressed him with the self-regulation of n ature, was a landlocked lake which rejuvenated itself before his eyes. One warm day he was about to strip and swim in the isolated lake, when it roa red with sudden move- ment. Whorls appeared on the surface and half-subme rged logs started to move. The debris circled, faster and faster while a massive whirlpool formed in the middle of the lake. Then the huge log s sucked into the cen- tre upended and disappeared into the whirlpool. Aft er the waters stilled momentarily, a gigantic waterspout startled Schaube rger even more. Turn- ing as it rose, the spout reached as high as a hous e then settled back, and the waters began to rise on the shore. The young ga mekeeper ran; he had seen enough. But the incident added to the mystery of this substance which fascinated him—water. Schauberger was well-pl aced for develop- ing his unique understanding of water; his workplac e was big enough for interconnected life processes to mesh without hindr ance there. Life forms interacted in balance; it was still an unbroken web of life. Six foot tall Viktor at that time of his life was s aid to be a picture of contentment—muscular good health from hiking the hi gh country, and alert intelligence described in his facial features —farseeing eyes, the slight curve of his nose reminiscent of an eagle's beak, and the determined but good-humoured set to his mouth. He wrote that t his was a happy time, while he watched the larger animals migrate with th e seasons and observed salmon and trout in cold mountain streams. Countless hours of studying the fish in motion gave him insights which later led to one of his inventions, called the trout turbine. Picture him a t rest on a summer after- noon, his long frame stretched on a grassy riverban k. Sunlight filters through a canopy of leafy branches overhanging the river. Deep in this pristine mountain setting, the combination of his s harply observant eyes and his i n t u i t i o n was synthesizing new knowledge."},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"194 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries LEARNING FROM THE SOURCE He learned that water swirling over rocks in a tree -shaded natural setting carries a vitality which is real as an electric cur rent carried by wires. And minerals carried along on that vitalized inward-cur ling water enrich the trees whose rootlets seek the mud. Trees and water, water and trees. Each needs to have the other growing in a natural state. The young forest warden once hiked up a mountain wi th some hunters, old men who were familiar with the area. High on th e mountain they found a heap of rocks which had been part of a ston e hut which had arched over a mountain spring for as long as anyone could remember. Hikers tra- ditionally would duck into the cool interior of the hut and ladle a drink of refreshing water. Now, however, someone had dismant led the hut and exposed the spring to sunlight. To the surprise of the old hunters who came there seasonally, the now exposed water shrank back into the earth; the spring dried up for the first time, and it stay ed dry. After months and much head-scratching, they decided to rebuild the s tone hut. Eventually the spring returned and continued to flow, season a fter season. Incidents such as this taught Schauberger that wate r needs to be cool— about 4°C [celsius]—even as it bubbles out of the g round. Without a shad- ed exit, he found, water will not \"grow\" to a great height underground and emerge as the mountaintop spring. As well as temper ature, time spent maturing in underground rocks provides minerals whi ch help make water sparkle with energy. Schauberger noticed beautiful vegetation growing ar ound natural springs —an indication of \"mature\" mineralized energeticall y-charged water. These concepts, of water having qualities such as s trength and maturity, were not found in any textbooks or lecture notes. T he brash forester later told hydrologists to abandon their microscopes and testing laboratories, and instead study water holistically in its environ ment. He found natural watercourses to be alive with inherent intelligence , and not to be mere movements of a chemical substance. Another mystery which fascinated him was the sight of large trout and salmon lying nearly motionless in a stream while fa cing into a swift cur- rent. When the forester moved and startled the fish , they darted upstream headlong into the rushing current. Why didn't they go with the obvious flow and escape downstream? Was there some invisibl e channel of ener- gy running opposite to the current? He decided to experiment on a sizable stream with r apids where a large trout often lay. Schauberger sent his woodsmen 500 metres upstream to build a bonfire. He instructed them to heat about a hundred litres of water and pour it in the stream on signal. This i n f u s i o n of warm in water made no noticeable difference in the overall temperature of the stream. But the"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Unorthodox Science 195 position of the large trout downstream immediately weakened, and de- spite thrashing its tail and fins, it was swept dow nstream. Schauberger was then sure of the connection between water tempe rature and some unknown flow of energy in the water. This reinforced his belief that the sheltering tang le of willow branches overhanging a river is crucial; without cooling sha de, excess warming would cause the water to lose an electrical-type po tency. One moonlit night brought both danger and a magical sight. He was sit- ting beside a waterfall waiting to catch a notoriou s fish poacher. To pass the time he watched trout swim in the crystal-clear pond below. Suddenly a much larger trout arrived and dominated the scene with a twisting under- water dance. It headed under the main fall of water , and soon reappeared for an instant, spinning vertically under a glitter ing cone-shaped stream of water. To Viktor's amazement, the lone fish then st opped spinning and instead floated upward to a higher ledge of the wat erfall. There it fell into the rush water and disappeared again with a swish o f its tail. The dangerous poacher was forgotten, after the spec tacle of a silvey fish floating up the moonlit waterfall. Schauberger filled his pipe and slowly, thoughtfully, walked home. Again, it seemed the wild stream must generate some type of energy. Years later, Schauber ger would devise an experiment which clearly demonstrated an electric c harge present in mov- ing water. COULDN'T BELIEVE HIS EYES Another clear night, in late winter, he again rubbe d his sharply observant eyes in disbelief. Exploring a rushing stream in br ight moonlight, he stood on the bank looking down into a deep pool. The wate r was so clear that he could see the bottom, several metres below the surf ace. Large stones on the bottom were jostling about. Even more amazing, an egg-shaped stone about the size of a human head started circling in the same way as a trout does before jumping a waterfall. Suddenly the rock broke the surface of the pond, and slowly a circle of ice formed around the floating stone. Was this a cold-generating instead of a heat-generating process? Then one by one nearly all the egg-shaped stones circled up and appeared on the sur- face. Stones of other shapes remained unmoving on t he bottom. What metals did the dancing stones contain? Why the egg shape? What force develops in this pristine water? What is moti on, anyway? Schauberger had a lot of solitude for mulling these questions, and even- tually he developed a theory about different types of motion. He saw that water needed freedom to move in a vortexian motion (three dimensional spiralling). He saw the s p i r a l l i n g shape in the growth of vines, ferns, snail shells,"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"196 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries whirlpools, galaxies and countless other formations . The hyperbolic spi- ral was everywhere, as if acting out some underlyin g universal motion. In uncaged rivers, the spiral was seen in the horizont al tightening twists of the layered current. He became certain that the con tracting vortex created a very real energy in the water as it flowed. Schauberger learned how colder, denser, stronger wa ter in streams car- ried heavy natural debris without silting, and how undisturbed rivers man- aged seasonal torrents without seriously eroding th eir banks. Schauberger proved to be a skilled engineer who tur ned his insights into practical devices. But even his first inventio n was controversial. PRINCE NEEDED CASH While Schauberger was studying nature's habits, out side the forest others were more entranced by worldly ways. The aging prin ce who owned the wilderness had a young wife who liked to gamble, so he needed quick cash to pay his wife's debts. The prince eyed his r emote forests and saw lumber which could be sold. The prince's predicamen t placed a challenge before his forester—could Schauberger make a miles- long wooden water- slide which would carry logs from the high mountain slopes down to the valley? Experts said it was impossible—heavy logs would scr ape to a halt on the wooden slide. Or if they somehow gathered speed , they would smash the sides of a flume. However, from his father and from observing wild rivers, Schauberger knew how to bolster the strengt h of water just as nature does, so that even heavy beechwood would rid e high on the shal- low stream. He hired men to build a strange structu re which curved and twisted down the steep mountain. At points along th e route, his design included valves for inlets and outlets which poured in cold water from other streams and released sun-warmed water from th e chute. The day before the deadline, a log started down the new chute for a test run, then it stalled and stuck in place. The workme n snickered, they had no faith in this zigzagging construction. Schauberger sent them home so that he could think. While sitting on a rock looking down at his log-sorting dams, he felt a snake under his leather trousers. After he jumped up and threw it a way, it landed in the dam. Observing it through binoculars, he wondered h ow a snake can swim so quickly without fins. As if in answer to his pro blem of transporting logs, the snake twisted in both vertical and horizo ntal curves. \"Understand Nature, then copy Nature,\" was Schauber ger's motto. From the sawmill he ordered lengths of wood, and hi s workers hammered all night, nailing short timbers within the curves of the flume to add the up-down snakelike motion to the water."},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Unorthodox Science 197 When the Prince and Princess and other dignitaries arrived for the demonstration the next day, there had been no time for a test run. None of the men believed the flimsy-appearing structure cou ld carry even one of the massive logs without disaster. But it did work. The cold water floated heavy logs and the shape of the chute spiralled the water, which swept the logs always toward the centre of the current and aw ay from the sides of the wooden flume. The serpentine movement was a suc cess. PROFESSIONALS JEALOUS In gratitude the Prince appointed Schauberger as he ad warden of all his hunting and forest districts. Then Schauberger was awarded a further hon- our—the position of State Consultant for Timber Flo tation Installations. Not everyone was pleased, however. Experts with aca demics degrees resented the fact that a non-academic had landed su ch a high-salaried position, and the fact that they had to consult wit h him. Finally the pay- scale furore reached high levels, and the federal m inister who hired Schauberger had to cut his salary in half. Schauber ger was welcome to stay on the job, though, and the minister offered t o make up the missing half of his wages out of the minister's \"black fund s.\" Schauberger would have nothing to do with such sleazy practices, howe ver, and he immedi- ately resigned. He was then hired by a private building contractor to construct log flumes in various European countries until 1934, wh en Schauberger again criticized an employer's manipulations. Why would a natural philosopher like Schauberger ge t involved in log transport, anyway? The answer is complex. Earlier a s a forester, it was his job to plan how to move wind-felled timber from hig h slopes down to val- leys where people could use it for firewood and bui lding. Schauberger opposed what he saw as exploitation of horses; he o bjected to the practice of forcing draft animals to burst their sinews pull ing heavy logs down mountainsides. Also, his biographer Olaf Alexanders son writes, Schauberger naively tried to restrict tree-cutting by reducing transport costs—the com- panies would not need to cut as many trees in order to make the same amount of profit. At the same time as he was flume-building, he gave speeches and wrote articles about the result of clearing a forest area totally—loss of healthy water downstream and, eventually, drought. \"Every economic death of a people is always precede d by the death of its forests,\" he warned. Forests were not as checkered with clearcuts at tha t time, and local sawmills were not all bought up by large companies which were to become voracious in their appetite for timber. However, Sc hauberger was alarmed"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"198 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries at what he saw forthcoming—\"Reckless deforestation results in the dry- ing out of mountain sources, dying of whole forests , uncontrollable moun- tain streams, silting of water and the sinking of s ubterranean water stores near where human interference took place.\" \"Water follows the same laws as the blood in our bo dies and the sap in plants; it has analogically the right of being trea ted as the blood of earth.\" He sharply criticized hydrologists—the experts on w ater—and said that they had only their own careers in mind and had fai led radically to understand what was happening in watercourses. \"The y did nothing, except reinforce . . . quite haphazardly, some bank s of rivers and brooks, but managed to forget everything about the water it self as if it had no concern.\" OFFICIAL EXPERTS JEER Hydrologists scorned Schauberger's non-academic war nings. He had learned that river water is made up of layers of di fferent densities and the lamination has a purpose in generating a charge in healthy water. Water is not merely a chemical compound, he insisted; it sho uld not be recklessly chopped up in hydro-electric turbines, much less in jected with chlorine or unnecessarily exposed to heating. The experts hooted when he pointed out that in a pe rson, a temperature change of only a tenth of a degree celcius could me an sickness or health. Was he comparing a planet with a person? Did he thi nk Earth was a liv- ing organism with biologically-active bloodstream? They ignored the heretical concepts. Schauberger offered to organize a job creation proj ect to rebuild water- courses. If artificially-channelled rivers were to be uncaged and restored to their meanders and oxbows sheltered by vegetatio n, would the rivers again keep their own channels clean and stop their own wild flooding? Schauberger was never given the chance to find out. He was realistic enough to look for a more feasible way of rebuildin g, and in 1929 he patented a system of braking barriers to be inserte d along a troublesome watercourse. The barriers would redirect the axis o f flow toward the mid- dle of a stream, reducing the amount of soil carrie d away from the banks. Another complex Schauberger patent offered to both control the action of outlet water from holding dams and to strengthen th e dams by including factors of temperature and motion. Was anyone from academia listening? One renowned hy drologist even- tually was; he started out by denigrating Schauberg er and ended up fol- lowing him around in the woods and even into a chil ly river. Professor Forcheimer literally waded into Schauberger's teach ings about the laws governing water's behaviour, and the professor deci ded that the self-edu-"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Unorthodox Science 199 cated man actually based theories on facts. Unlike colleagues who were in the middle of academic careers, Forcheimer would no t lose financially by championing a heretic; the professor was in his sev enties and, as it turned out, near the end of his life. Regardless of his bitter battles with the scientifi c community, Schau- berger believed in the scientific method. He experi mented on liquids and gases in a small laboratory he set up. His aim howe ver, was to develop a science which actually worked [on principles opposi te to the orthodox viewpoint]. \"Humanity has committed a great crime b y ignoring the use of cycloidal motion of water,\" he said. For example , the current water- pumping devices were not only uneconomical, he said , \"they cause water to degenerate by depriving it of its biological val ues.\" Attempts to explain connections between cycloidal m otion and levita- tion to a scientist are useless, Schauberger said b itterly. Nor are world leaders any help \"because they lean on the ignoranc e of the masses, including the scientists, as well as . . . current physical laws, to safeguard their vested interests and positions.\" Conventional energy conversion—burning of fossil fu els or atom-split- ting—turns order into chaos. Schauberger proposed p rocesses which would add order and energy to substances such as water, i nstead of destroying it, while generating useful electric power. POWER FROM THE UNKNOWN Schauberger believed that an invisible field struct ure permeated every- thing and was necessary for life, but he observed t hat technologies could propel the unknown field structure into either moti ons harmful to biosys- tems or helpful to biosystems. In other words, he h eld technical planners responsible for the life or death of biological sys tems. How did he prove his ideas? Not one to stay at the vapourware [designed but not yet produced] level of ideas, Schauberger picked up his tools and built hardware. From water- courses to agricultural implements, his constructio ns attracted praise from users. Then he turned to extracting electrical ener gy directly from the flow of water and air. \"They contain all the power we ne ed.\" Hitler had heard of the Living Water Man through an industrialist. After Germany took over Austria in 1938, word came to Sch auberger that he would be hired to plan log flotation structures in Bavaria, Bohemia and North Austria, and that furthermore he could use a professor's laboratory in Nuremburg for his research. Viktor Schauberger sent for his son Walter (born Ju ly 26, 1914). Walter had studied physics in university and found that so me of his father's con- cepts were foreign to the way he had been taught to think. However."},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"200 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries Walter's scepticism crumbled during the experiments they conducted. Walter contributed useful techniques himself, and t he duo were soon extracting 50,000 volts from fine jets of water at low pressures. A physi- cist from a nearby technical college came; his firs t action was to search for hidden wires. When he could find none, he lost his temper and asked Walter where he had hidden the electrical leads. Ev entually he had to admit that there was no trick involved; the experim ent was valid. However, he could not explain such a high charge fr om water. The Second World War interrupted their experiments, and Walter [was] drafted. Viktor was ordered to undergo a physical e xamination suppos- edly related to his forthcoming pension. However, s ays biographer Alexandersson, \"it looked like an engineering and a rchitectural associa- tion was behind this demand for a check-up.\" Viktor Schauberger unsuspectingly showed up, but wa s whisked away to another clinic. He was told it was for a special exam, but to his horror he found himself being questioned in a psychiatric clinic. He forced him- self to answer the questions in a peaceful non-abra sive way; if he dis- played anger he might be locked up. Two doctors tes ted him and found him perfectly sane as well as highly intelligent. T hey never found out who had arranged to get him into the mental hospital. \"BUILD MACHINES, OR DIE\" He himself was drafted in 1943, despite his age. Af ter a brief stint as com- mander of a parachute group in Italy, he was ordere d by Himmler [Hitler's chief lieutenant] to the Mauthausen concentration c amp. Himmler's greet- ing, passed on by the camp's military leader, gave him a choice—death by hanging, or develop machines which used the energy he had discovered. He was told to lead a scientific team of the best e ngineers and stress-ana- lysts from among the prisoners. The work was based on Schauberger's discovery of ho w to develop a low-pressure zone at the atomic level. This had h appened in seconds when his laboratory device whirled air or water \"ra dially and axially\" at a falling temperature. He referred to the result ing force as diamagnetic levitation power. He emphasized that nature uses in direct—what Schauberger called reactionary—suction force. He insisted that the technical team from the concen tration camp be treated as free men would. After their research hea dquarters was bombed, they were transferred to Leonstein and started a fl ying disc project to be powered with his trout-inspired turbine which rotat ed air into a twisting type of oscillation resulting in a buildup of immen se power causing levi- tation. A small model which crashed against the cei ling glowed blue-green at first as it rose, then trailed a silvery glow."},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Unorthodox Science 201 According to researcher Norbert Harthun, his device s were no more than laboratory models by the end of the War. Howev er, the American military officers who showed up a few days after th e model hit the ceiling seemed to know what he was doing. They seized every thing. He was interrogated by a high-ranking officer, and put in \"protective custody\" for six months. The officers also heavily questioned hi s helpers. Russian members of the team later returned to the Soviet Un ion. Alexandersson's book quotes a letter from Schauberg er saying he was confined by the occupying forces for nearly a year because of his knowl- edge of atomic energy (even though his research was directed toward implosion—which was labelled fusion—rather than tow ard the destruc- tive fission approach to the atom). A few tantalizing bits of lore about Hitler's \"flyi ng saucers\" rose into public awareness years later. The July 27, 1956 Mun ich publication Da Neue Zeitalter said that\".. . Viktor Schauberger wa s the inventor and dis- coverer of this new motive power—implosion, which, with the use of only air and water, generated light, heat and motion.\" T he first unmanned fly- ing disc was tested February 19, 1945 near Prague, the German periodical claimed; the disc could hover motionless in the air and could fly as fast backwards as forwards. \"This 'flying disc' had a di ameter of 50 metres.\" Viktor wrote to a friend in 1958 that the craft tes t-flown near Prague was built according to the model he made at the concent ration camp, and it rose to 15,000 metres in three minutes. It then flew hor izontally at 2,200 kilo- metres per hour. \"It was only after the war that I came to hear, through one of the workers under my direction, a Czech, that fu rther intensive develop- ment was in progress; however, there was no answer to my enquiry.\" There is no doubt Viktor Schauberger knew how to bu ild an implosion device which levitated. His problem was how to brak e it. Test models gen- erated so much energy that an entire engine lifted itself off the floor, lev- itated in the high-ceilinged test hall, and crashed against the ceiling. At the end of the Second World War, American and Ru ssian military confiscated his models, diagrams and even the mater ials he used. Re- portedly the Russians even burned his apartment in case they had missed any technological secrets hidden there. Did anyone carry on the levitation- craft work after Schauberger's wartime research tea m was split up? The answer may be buried in some country's classified d efense files. After the Far East Treaty was signed, Schauberger t ook up his research again. He had lost his financial assets in the war, but he stubbornly per- sisted from his home at Linz, and took out patents. Despite having no money, he thought he could help the world by turnin g his inventive genius and his insights toward agriculture. Bitter about the effects of both the chemical indus try and deforestation"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"202 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries upon agriculture, he stated, \"The farmers work hand -in-hand with our foresters. The blood of the earth continuously weak ens, and the produc- tivity of the soil decreases.\" When forests can no longer nurture water sources wh ich supply vitali- ty, then farmland downstream cannot build up a volt age in the ground which is necessary for keeping parasitic bacteria i n balance, he observed. Noticing that soil dried out after being ploughed w ith iron ploughs, he built copper-plated ploughs. The ploughs successful ly increased crops, but the greed of special-interest groups stopped th e venture. Schauberger continued to come up with innovations t o help grow healthy crops, until all his work was halted in 195 8. Walter and Viktor were in the United States from June 26 through Sept ember 20, 1958, liv- ing together day and night, and Walter emerged from the experience with a new appreciation of Viktor's knowledge. But their joint attempt to get his implosion generator funded and developed was de railed. PROMISES PROM THE USA Little is known publicly about their trip to Americ a except a few key aspects. In the winter of 1958 two men, which Europ ean researchers refer to as \"American agents,\" visited Viktor and convinc ed him to go to America for what they promised would be only three months. He was led to believe that the purpose would be to finally con vert his knowledge into the manufacturing of beneficial devices. It turned out to be an ordeal which the father and son had not expect- ed. They were flown to a sweltering hot climate—Tex as in summer— which stressed Viktor's health. He was now nearly 7 3 years old. Over the months Viktor became increasingly angry because the men and their asso- ciates now were in no hurry to set up a facility an d develop implosion motors to generate clean power. \"Now we have plenty of time,\" was their reply. At first trusting the sincerity of his hosts, Schau berger had brought all his documents and devices to Texas, and was then as ked to write down everything he knew. He co-operated and the material was sent to an atom- ic technology expert who met with the Schaubergers for three days in September. According to Olaf Alexandersson, the exp ert from New York said \"... The path which Mr. Schauberger in his tre atise and with his mod- els has followed is the biotechnical path of the fu ture. What Schauberger proposes and asserts is correct. In four years, all this will be confirmed.\" The two Schaubergers expected to go home now; three months had passed. But the Texas group apparently demanded tha t the father and son remain in the United States of America and live in the Arizona desert. The Schaubergers refused. After much argument, the Amer icans relented and"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Unorthodox Science 203 said Viktor could travel home, but first he had to sign a contract and agree to take a course in English. Unfortunately the cont ract was in English and Viktor did not know the language. His biographers s ay he was pressured to sign quickly; their flight would leave shortly a nd there was no time to quibble. Viktor at that point only wanted to get out of the hellish heat and away from these deceptive people. He signed. Walter refu sed to sign. He would be on dangerous ground with immigrant authorities i f he signed such a contact, for one thing. After Viktor gave in and signed, suddenly there was ample time before they needed to go to the airport. Champagne corks p opped and their hosts celebrated. One can only imagine the conversation between fathe r and son on the flight home. At last we can go home; get away from those thieves. But what have we done? Walter probably had the heartbreaking task of spell ing it out to his father. \"Yes, it is as I told you when they were pr essuring you to sign; the contract says that now you can't write about or eve n talk about your past-and-future discoveries, and you are bound to g ive everything you know to that boss of the Texas consortium. Their co ntract says they now have all the rights to the 'Schauberger business' a s they put it.\" Was Schauberger's implosion process considered by t he American officials to be \"cold fusion\"? The Austrian observe r of nature apparently did arrive at results related to modern sub-atomic research. In the late 1980s, an independent researcher tried to get infor mation on the Texas inci- dent. Erwin Krieger's attempt to get information th rough the Freedom of Information Act failed; he was told by a form lette r that the material may be related to national security. \"I DON'T EVEN OWN MYSELF\" Viktor Schauberger was at the end a despairing man. In the last few days of his life he reportedly cried over and over, \"The y took everything from me, everything. I don't even own myself!\" Stripped of hope, he died five days after they returned home. His passion for learning nature's ways and then app lying that knowl- edge to life-enhancing technology, and his efforts to interest those who could fund its development, had let him a long way from the peaceful for- est. The more recent loss was the legal right to wo rk on his implosion technology. But how did that compare to what seemed like the loss of his lifetime of hard-won insights?

Nature was thrown out of balance. Too much of the life-destructive motions and not enough of the life-creative motions ? In Schauberger's despairing view, humanity was headed towards a ment al and spiritual sluggishness, easily controlled by dictators who st ep in at a time of food shortages. More than thirty-five years after Viktor Schauberge r's death, there is a surge of concern for the planet's health. The healt h of its inhabitants—in the sea and on land—is in turn deteriorating. Will humanity turn toward Viktor Schauberger's insights? There are signs: mav erick scientists are developing theories such as how a subtle energy (un known field structure) may be drawn into use by shapes and vortexian movem ents. In Europe, new books and magazines bring out Schauberger's tea chings; nonconven- tional scientists teach that the opposite poles in nature (light and dark, warm and cold, pressure and suction, male and femal e and so on) are nec- essary to create movement. Further, these books say , without movement there is no life, and the force created in healthy moving water is the life force. Cambridge-educated John Davidson of England looks a t \"a possible similarity between magnetic alignment of atoms in i ron, and alignment of molecules of water moved in Schauberger-advocate d hyperbolic spirals ... we create effects which were not apparent befor ehand.\" Across the Atlantic, nuclear physicist Dan Davidson suggested mathe- matical research into natural river meanders, natur ally occurring spirals and other geometric patterns in nature, to find equ ations for tapping the diamagnetic forces which Viktor Schauberger used. Meanwhile in Europe, Walter Schauberger snubbed Ame ricans who tried to communicate with him; so deep was his ange r at the way his father was treated. But Walter is reportedly doing all he can to carry on his father's work, at his secluded private institute. A mong other teams doing scientifically-rigorous related research are the Sc andinavian Institutes of Ecological Technique. In New Mexico, William Baumgartner dedicated years to experiment- ing on building implosion hardware such as a versio n of Schauberger's \"trout motor\" and a water-energizing device, and he expects to have a reli- able suction turbine built by the time this is in p rint. Baumgartner also lec- tures on Schauberger's innovations for agriculture and water treatment, as does Callum Coates in Australia and others in Europ e and Canada. Life-oriented technology may yet arrive in time.

He sought to solve a mystery and in the proces s generated enormous controversy in the fields of archaeology, astronomy and cosmology. The attack by many members of the scientific community on his work, their attempts to intimidate his publisher and suppress h is evidence have made Velikovsky the Galileo of our time. The story starts in 1939. Then Dr. Velikovsky, a pr actising psychoanalyst who had studied with Freud, went to the U.S. to res earch a book on three dominant figures of the ancient Mediterranean—Moses , Oedipus and Akhnaton. When he was nearly complete a question ar ose about the time of the Exodus of the Hebrews from Egypt. Although r ecorded in detail by the Hebrews there was no equivalent record in Egypt ian history. Why? Under the conventional chronology of Egyptian histo ry, the time period usually considered for the Exodus causes problems. For many other events in Hebrew history there appear to be no Egyptian co unterparts either—but these two nations existed beside each other for cen turies, according to the Hebrews. Velikovsky's answer to this lack of correl ation was to suggest that the accepted chronology of ancient Egypt was off by five hundred years. He noted that our dating of Egyptian periods came from the dynastic records handed down by Aegyptus and Agrippa, and that the r eigns of the Pharaohs used to date Egyptian history had been strung toget her one after another. The key to the \"missing\" half millenium was that th ere were many \"co-reg- nal\" periods where the reigns of monarchs overlappe d or were indistinct. In his revised chronology, many events in Hebrew histo ry were found to have their counterpart in the Egyptian record. The new chronology was b u i l t from the archaeologica l evidence found in the ruins of ancient Egypt. From remaining papyrus and pottery, tomb paint 207"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"208 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries ings and monuments a new story emerged. Because the histories of Greece, Assyria, Babylon and Judea were all dated from the dynastic records of Egypt, Velikovsky's work became highly controversia l. In 1945 this was limited to a specialist field, but his next publica tion in 1950, Worlds in Collision, aroused widespread controversy, and was Velikovsky's explana- tion of the cause of this amnesia in our collective memory. THE COMET VENUS The ancient civilisation of Egypt was nearly destro yed in a cosmic catas- trophe that endangered the entire planet, according to Velikovsky. Everywhere, huge resources were devoted to study of the skies. It's wide- ly known that ancient civilisations in Asia, the Am ericas, Europe and the Middle East were highly advanced in astronomy. Whil e we accept this as a common feature of our past, why were so many peop le interested in the study of the movements of the planets? Why is the a lignment of astro- nomical instruments found in Babylon 2.5 degrees ou t from the present alignment of the Earth? Why did calendars construct ed between the mid- dle of the second millenium BCE* and 800 BCE have 3 60 days and months of thirty days? Why do even earlier calendar s have days, months and years of different lengths again? Velikovsky's answer was that the Earth and Mars had been involved in repeated near collisions with a gigantic comet s ince our recorded his- tory began. The events described in the Exodus and in Egyptian papyri are a vivid description of an age in chaos—plagues, tur moil and darkness, and the flight of the Hebrews from Egypt toward a \" column of fire\" in Sinai. The Earth was momentarily slowed down and its axis slightly altered as the comet passed by. Electrostatic forces caused discharges to arc between the Earth and the comet turning the skies t o fire and the forests to flame. The crust was rent, volcanoes erupted, ea rthquakes rocked and darkness enveloped the world—the time of the Exodus . Seven hundred years later Isiah, Joel and Amos described another series of upheavals; the Sun appeared to stand still in the sky. Although sl ightly dislodged from its axis and orbit again, the Earth fared better this s econd time. These were, in fact, the last two acts of a cosmic drama; the e arliest act of which we have records is called The Deluge. All cosmological theories assumed that the planets have evolved in their places for billions of years . . .

Velikovsky believed that the origin of the comet th at was responsible for changes in the Earth's orbit was in the proto-s tar we know as Jupiter. This idea outraged the scientific community. But hi s theories about the natures of Jupiter and Venus have not yet been prov en wrong. He said that because Venus was younger than the other planets, i ts surface tempera- ture would be much hotter and its atmosphere denser than astronomers believed; these predictions were proven correct. He predicted Venus would be found to have orbital a nomalies in rela- tion to the other planets; Venus has since been fou nd to rotate on its axis in reverse direction to the other planets, and its day is longer than its year. We now know that parts of the atmosphere of Venus r otate in 4 days (with winds of up to 400 km/h) while the planet itself ro tates in 243 days. Both these rotations are retrograde. One of Velikovsky's hypotheses for the slowing of the Earth's rotation which made the Sun appear to stand still was that the planet was engulfed in the extended at mosphere of the comet Venus. Some of the diurnal rotation of the Earth wa s imparted to this dust-cloud according to Velikovsky, which fits the eccentric characteris- tics of the Venusian atmosphere. The comet spiralled past the Earth in an ever-decre asing path around the Sun before taking up its present orbit as the p lanet Venus. He further cites evidence to show that the Earth interacted wi th Mars on a number of occasions when writing was better developed than du ring the Venusian encounters, after Venus flipped Mars out of its orb it. Disturbances caused by the passages of Mars consisted of earthquakes an d electrical dis- charges. Most of the \"Mars events\" took place withi n a ninety-year peri- od. This may sound far-fetched, but Velikovsky's ev idence and the pre- dictions he made from it have stood the test of nea rly four decades of investigation. As in his previous work, Velikovsky amassed an impressive range of evidence to support his case. MYTHIC KEYS To support his interpretation of the Hebrew and Egy ptian histories, Velikovsky searched the records of the civilisation s of the eighth and fif- teenth centuries BCE. In his last book he described his many years of research as sitting at the feet of sages \"to listen to those who lived close to the events of the past ... I realised very soon that the ancient sages lived in a frightened stat e of mi n d . \" What became q uickly apparent was"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"210 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries the similarity of the events these peoples had expe rienced, and the fear that global upheavals associated with planetary enc ounters had inspired. The legends of the past are folklore, but the simil arity of motifs from five continents and Pacific Ocean islands is striki ng; witches on brooms, the dragon and the scorpion, an animal with many he ads and winged body, a woman whose veils stream behind her—these images are universal cos- mic myths recording the characteristic shapes posse ssed by comets. Velikovsky tracks the motif of the sun being trappe d in its movement through the tales of the Polynesians, Hawaiians and North American Indians. Like the Middle-East civilisations they ha ve the story of the sun being snared and freed by a mouse. In the Hawaiian version Mauii caught and beat the sun, which begged for mercy and promis ed to go more slow- ly ever after. At the same time new islands appeare d. The Ute Indians tell of a piece of sun setting fire to the world, which was broken off by a rab- bit after the sun rose, went down and rose again. The legend of the cosmic battle of the planetary go ds is familiar to us all. In the Homeric epics the Greeks choose Athe ne/Venus for their protector, the Trojans Ares/Mars. A similar situati on existed in ancient Mexico. The Toltecs worshipped Quetzal-cohuatl/Venu s, but the later Aztecs revered Huitzilopachtil/Mars. The identity, conflict and features of the planetary gods are consistent across the ancien t world. Chinese chronicles record two suns doing battle in the sky and the dis- turbance of the other planets this caused. Mars was pursued by Venus, the Earth shook, glowing mountains collapsed, \"the cust oms of the age are thrown into disorder... all living beings harass on e another.\" An old text- book of Hindu astronomy has a chapter on planetary conjunctions. A planet can be struck down or utterly vanquished, an d the victor in these encounters is usually the planet Venus. A juncture of the planets is called a yuga in Hindu astronomy; the ages of the world ar e also called yugas. An association for the planet Mars with the wolf is also common. In Babylon one of the seven names of Mars was wolf. An Egyptian god with the head of a wolf prowled the land. The Romans use d the wolf as the ani- mal symbol for Mars. Slavic mythology has a god in the shape of a wolf, Vukadlak, who devoured the Sun and Moon. In the Ice landic epic The Edda, the god that darkens the Sun is the wolf Fenr is, who battled the ser- pent Midgard in the heavens above.

The violence of this destruction can be seen across Western Europe where every major rock fissure is filled with the b ones of animals, splin- tered and smashed into fragments. One 1,400 foot hi ll in France is capped by the remains of mammoths, reindeer, horses and ot her animals. America has beds of fossil bones containing 100 bones per s quare foot, deposited in sand. Some of these are over 200 feet high. The hills of the Himalayas and Burma contain similar beds of bones. In China, among these fractured bones, the skeletons of seven humans were found. Eu ropean, Melanesian and Eskimo types were lying together. Extinct and e xtant species of ani- mals have been found mixed together in English depo sits. RECORDS The conventional theory of slow and uniform geologi cal processes cannot explain these deposits—instead, they are evidence o f major catastrophes which have struck the planet. Velikovsky suggests a giant tidal wave which engulfed the world that picked up and carried plants and animals over a great distance and smashed them intermingled into common graves. This and the transformation of the Earth's climate are explained as consequences of the rapid change of the Earth's axi s brought about by a near-collision with another planet. The geological record tells a similar compelling st ory to that which paleontologists have unearthed. At 1,400 feet (400 metres) altitude in the"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"212 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries Andes there are high water surf marks lined with un decayed seashells. There are many ruins surrounded by terraces for cul tivation on the dry west side of the Andes. On the east side, terraces continue far past the per- manent snowline. Before the last lava sheet spread over Columbia there were human settlements there, the remains of which have been found. That the Andes mountains were raised in fairly rece nt times by unimagin- able forces is one conclusion. The ocean floor around the globe also bears witness to flows of lava and volcanic ash which covered a violently shifting bedrock while tidal waves battered the continents. There were once dry land and beaches in many places where the Atlantic Ocean now lies. The bottom of the seas show that the Earth has been showered with meteorit es on a very large scale, leaving clay deposits rich in nickel, radium and iron. When the Earth's axis was shifted by the interactio n of the Earth's and the [rogue] planet's magnetic fields, magnetic eddy currents formed in the atmosphere. These generated great heat and melted r ocks on the surface. As this rock cooled, it reformed with a different m agnetic polarity to sur- rounding strata. All over the world, similar local rock formations are found with their magnetic polarisation reversed. Fo r this to be the case the Earth's magnetic field must have been reversed when these rocks were formed. Also, rocks with this inverted polarity are far more strongly mag- netised than the Earth's magnetic field alone can a ccount for. Why was volcanic activity so common in the recent p ast? How was the sea floor raised and lowered around the world? As t he Earth's axis shift- ed in earlier times, the inertia of air and water c aused hurricanes and tidal waves; the stress on the planet caused volcanism an d an outpouring of magma, sending up clouds of volcanic ash that threw a cloak of darkness over a sunless world. The heat generated by these forces evaporated seas. In some places tor- rential downpours formed great streams running thro ugh recently opened fissures in the Earth's crust which suddenly eroded the landscape. Else- where, snow fell and covered the land with continen tal ice sheets. At the poles, a permanent snowcover grew as the land coole d. Climatic changes, ice cover, mountain building and the reverse mag- netic orientation of rocks are explained by Velikov sky's theory of cosmic catastrophe. However, the accepted view of the Eart h's geological history is known as uniformitarianism; where the gradual wo rkings of natural forces has produced the world as we know it. Needle ss to say, Velikovsky aroused as great a controversy in geology as he had previously in archae- ology and astronomy.

Under pressure, Macmillan transferred publication rights to Doubleday, who did not have a textbook department a nd burned their unsold copies. In reviews in reputable journals and public stateme nts, academics and scientists even criticised some of Velikovsky's wor ks before anyone had read the manuscript. Conferences were held to show Velikovsky's theories were wrong. Velikovsky died on November 17, 1979 at the age of 84. As more is learned about our solar system, some scientists hav e realized that his theories might conflict with accepted ideas but not actually conflict with the facts. RISING FROM AMNESIA Velikovsky theorised that humanity suffered a colle ctive amnesia on the subject of catastrophes. As a reaction to the repea ted near-destruction of human civilisation, a deep scar has been left on th e human psyche. Although the solar system has been settled for 2,70 0 years, he notes a 700 year cycle in the human collective consciousness. C hristianity in the first century A . D . and Islam in the seventh [century] were both founde d on apocalyptic visions of the transformation of the wo rld by fire. The four- teenth century was the time of the Black Death and the Hundred Years War which reduced the population of Western Europe by two-thirds. Velikovsky's fear was that in the twenty-first cent ury this trauma would be re-enacted by humanity, who is now in possession of the means of its own destruction.

David Hatcher Childress Who controls the past, controls the future. Who controls the present, controls the past. George Orwell, 1984 Most of us are familiar with the last scene in the popular Indiana Jones archaeological adventure film Raiders of the Lost A rk, in which an impor- tant historical artifact, the Ark of the Covenant f rom the Temple in Jerusalem, is locked in a crate and put in a giant warehouse, never to be seen again, thus ensuring that no history books wil l have to be rewritten and no history professor will have to revise the le cture that he has been giving for the last forty years. While the film was fiction, the scene in which an i mportant ancient relic is buried in a warehouse is uncomfortably close to reality for many re- searchers. To those who investigate allegations of archaeological cover-ups, there are disturbing indications that the most impo rtant archaeological insti- tute in the United States, the Smithsonian Institut ion, an independent feder- al agency, has been actively suppressing some of th e most interesting and important archaeological discoveries made in the Am ericas. The Vatican has been long accused of keeping artifa cts and ancient books in their vast cellars, without allowing the o utside world access to them. These secret treasures, often of a controvers ial historical or reli- gious nature, are allegedly suppressed by the Catho lic Church because they might damage the church's credibility, or perh aps cast their official texts in doubt. Sadly, there is overwhelming eviden ce that something very similar is happening with the Smithsonian Instituti on. The Smithsonian Institution was started in 1829 whe n an eccen- tric British millionaire, by the name of James Smit hson, died and left $515,169 to create an institution \"for the increase and diffusion of knowl- edge among men.\" Unfortunately, there is evidence t he Smithsonian has"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"216 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries been more active in the suppression of knowledge . . . than the diffusion of it for the last hundred years. The cover-up and alleged suppression of archaeologi cal evidence began in late 1881 when John Wesley Powell, the geo logist famous for exploring the Grand Canyon, appointed Cyrus Thomas as the director of the Eastern Mound Division of the Smithsonian Insti tution's Bureau of Ethnology. When Thomas came to the Bureau of Ethnology he was a \"pronounced believer in the existence of a race of Mound Builde rs, distinct from the American Indians.\" However, John Wesley Powell, the director of the Bureau of Ethnology, a very sympathetic man toward the American Indians, had lived with the peaceful Winnebago Indians of Wi sconsin for many years as a youth and felt that American Indians wer e unfairly thought of as primitive and savage. The Smithsonian began to promote the idea that Nati ve Americans, at that time being exterminated in the Indian wars, we re descended from advanced civilizations and were worthy of respect a nd protection. They also began a program of suppressing any archaeologi cal evidence that lent credence to the school of thought known as Diffusio nism, a school which believes that throughout history there has been wid espread dispersion of culture and civilization via contact by ship and ma jor trade routes. The Smithsonian opted for the opposite school, know n as Isolationism. Isolationism holds that most civilizations are isol ated from each other and that there has been very little contact between the m, especially those that are separated by bodies of water. In this intellect ual war that started in the 1880s, it was held that even contact between the ci vilizations of the Ohio and Mississippi Valleys was rare, and certainly the se civilizations did not have any contact with such advanced cultures as the Mayas, Toltecs, or Aztecs in Mexico and Central America. By Old World standards this is an extreme, and even ridiculous idea, considering that the river system reached to the Gulf of Mexico and these civilizatio ns were as close as the opposite shore of the gulf. It was like saying that cultures in the Black Sea area could not have had contact with the Mediterran ean. When the contents of many ancient mounds and pyrami ds of the Midwest were examined it was shown that the history of the Mississippi River Valleys was that of an ancient and sophistica ted culture that had been in contact with Europe and other areas. Not on ly that, the contents of many mounds revealed burials of huge men, sometimes seven or eight feet tall, in full armour with swords and sometimes huge treasures. For instance, when Spiro Mound in Oklahoma was exca vated in the 1930s, a tall man in full armour was discovered alo ng with a pot of thou- sands of pearls and other artifacts, t h e largest su ch treasure so far docu-"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Unorthodox Science 217 mented. The whereabouts of the man in armour is unk nown and it is quite likely that it eventually was taken to the Smithson ian Institution. In a private conversation with a well-known histori cal researcher (who shall remain nameless), I was told that a former em ployee of the Smith- sonian, who was dismissed for defending the view of Diffusionism in the Americas (i.e., the heresy that other ancient civil izations may have visit- ed the shores of North and South America during the many millennia before Columbus), alleged that the Smithsonian at o ne time had actually taken a barge full of unusual artifacts out into th e Atlantic and dumped them in the ocean. Though the idea of the Smithsonian's covering up a valuable archaeo- logical find is difficult to accept for some, there is, sadly, a great deal of evidence to suggest that the Smithsonian Institutio n has knowingly cov- ered up and \"lost\" important archaeological relics. The Stonewatch Newsletter of the Gungywamp Society in Connecticut, which researches megalithic sites in New England, had a curious stor y in their Winter 1992 issue about stone coffins discovered in 1892 in Ala bama which were sent to the Smithsonian Institution and then \"lost.\" Acc ording to the newslet- ter, researcher Frederick J. Pohl wrote an intrigui ng letter in 1950 to the late Dr. T. C. Lethbridge, a British archaeologist. The letter from Pohl stated: A professor of geology sent me a reprint (of the) S mithsonian Institution, The Crumf Burial Cave by Frank Burns, U.S. Geologic al Survey, from the report of the U.S. National Museum for 1892, pp . 451-454,1984. In the Crumf Cave, southern branch of the Warrior Rive r, in Murphy's Valley, Blount County Alabama, accessible from Mobi le Bay by river, were coffins of wood hollowed out by fire, aided by stone or copper chissels. Eight of these coffins were taken to the Smithsonian. They were about 7.5' long, 14\" to 18\" wide, 6\" to 7\" dee p. Lids open. I wrote recently to the Smithsonian, and received r eply March 11th from F. M. Setzler, Head Curator of Department of A nthropology. (He said) We have not been able to find the specimens i n our collections, though records show that they were received. David Barron, President of the Gungywamp Society wa s eventually told by the Smithsonian in 1992 that the coffins we re actually wooden troughs and that they could not be viewed anyway be cause they were housed in an asbestos-contaminated warehouse. This warehouse was to be closed for the next ten years and no one was all owed in except Smithsonian personnel! Ivan T.

While buildin g an airstrip, his crew bulldozed a group of hills and discovered unde r several sedimenta- ry layers what appeared to be human remains. The Al askan mound was in fact a graveyard of gigantic human remains, consist ing of crania and long leg bones. The crania measured from 22 to 24 inches from base to crown. Since an adult skull normally measures about eight inches from back to front such a large crania would imply an immense size for a normally propor- tioned human. Furthermore, every skull was said to have been neatly trepanned (a process of cutting a hole in the upper portion of the skull). In fact, the habit of flattening the skull of an in fant and forcing it to grow in an elongated shape was a practice used by ancien t Peruvians, the Mayas, and the Flathead Indians of Montana. Sanderson trie d to gather further proof, eventually receiving a letter from another m ember of the unit who continued the report. The letters both indicated th at the Smithsonian Insti- tution had collected the remains, yet nothing else was heard. Sanderson seemed convinced that the Smithsonian Institution h ad received the bizarre relics, but wondered why they would not release the data. He asks, \". .. is it that these people cannot face rewriting all the text books?\" In 1944 an accidental discovery of an even more con troversial nature was made by Waldemar Julsrud at Acambaro, Mexico. A cambaro is in the state of Guanajuato, 175 miles northwest of Mexico City. The strange archaeological site there yielded over 33,500 objec ts of ceramic [and] stone, including jade, and knives of obsidian (shar per than steel and still used today in heart surgery). Jalsrud, a prominent local German merchant, also found statues ranging from less than an inch t o six feet in length depicting great reptiles, some of them in active as sociation with humans—generally eating them, but in some bizarre s tatuettes an erotic association was indicated. To observers many of the se creatures resem- bled dinosaurs. Jalsrud crammed this collection into twelve rooms o f his expanded house. There, startling representations of Negroes, Orientals, and bearded Caucasians were included as were motifs of Egyptian , Sumerian and other ancient non-hemispheric civilisations, as well as p ortrayals of Bigfoot and aquatic monsterlike creatures, weird human-animal m ixtures, and a host of other inexplicable creations. Teeth from an exti nct Ice Age horse, the skeleton of a mammoth, and a number of human skulls were found at the same site as the ceramic artifacts. Radiocarbon dating in the laboratories of the Unive rsity of Penn- sylvania and additional tests using the thermolumin escence method of"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Unorthodox Science 219 dating pottery were performed to determine the age of the objects. Results indicated the objects were made about 6,500 years a go, around 4,500 B.C. A team of experts at another university, shown Jals rud's half-dozen sam- ples but unaware of their origin, ruled out the pos sibility that they could have been modern reproductions. However, they fell silent when told of their controversial source. In 1952, in an effort to debunk this weird collecti on which was gaining a certain amount of fame, American archaeologist Ch arles C. DiPeso claimed to have minutely examined the then 32,000 p ieces within not more than four hours spent at the home of Julsrud. In a forthcoming book long delayed by continuing development in his inves tigation, archaeolog- ical investigator John H. Tierney, who has lectured on the case for decades, points out that to have done that, DiPeso would have had to have inspected 133 pieces per minute steadily for four h ours, whereas in actu- ality, it would have required weeks merely to have separated the massive jumble of exhibits and arranged them properly for a valid evaluation. Tierney, who collaborated with the late Professor H apgood, the late William N. Russell, and others in the investigation , charges that the Smithsonian Institution and other archaeological au thorities conducted a campaign of disinformation against the discoveries. The Smithsonian had, early in the controversy, dismissed the entire Acam baro collection as an elaborate hoax. Also, utilizing the Freedom of Info rmation Act, Tierney discovered that practically the entirety of the Smi thsonian's Julsrud case files are missing. After two expeditions to the site in 1955 and 1968, Professor Charles Hapgood, a professor of history and anthropology at the University of New Hampshire, recorded the results of his eighteen -year investigation of Acambaro, in a privately printed book entitled Myst ery In Acambaro. Hapgood was initially an open-minded skeptic concer ning the collection but became a believer after his first visit in 1955 , at which time he wit- nessed some of the figures being excavated, and eve n dictated to the dig- gers where he wanted them to dig. Adding to the mind-boggling aspects of this controv ersy is the fact that the Institute Nacional de Antropologia e Historia, through the late Director of Prehispanic Monuments, Dr. Eduardo Nogu era, (who, as head of an official investigating team at the site, issu ed a report which Tierney will be publishing), admitted \"the apparent scienti fic legality with which these objects were found.\" Despite evidence of thei r own eyes, however, officials declared that because of the objects \"fan tastic\" nature, they had to have been a hoax played on Julsrud! A disappointed but ever-hopeful Julsrud died. His h ouse was sold and the collection put in storage. The collection is not cu rrently open to the public."},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"220 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries Perhaps the most amazing suppression of all is the excavation of an Egyptian tomb by the Smithsonian itself in Arizona. A lengthy front page story of the Phoenix Gazette on 5 April 1909 (see p age inset \"Explorations in Grand Canyon\" on page 222), gave a highly detail ed report of the dis- covery and excavation of a rock-cut vault by an exp edition led by Professor S. A. Jordan of the Smithsonian. The Smithsonian, h owever, claims to have absolutely no knowledge of the discovery or its dis coverers. The World Explorers Club decided to check on this s tory by calling the Smithsonian in Washington, D.C., though we felt the re was little chance of getting any real information. After speaking bri efly to an operator, we were transferred to a Smithsonian staff archaeologi st, and a woman's voice came on the phone and identified herself. I told her that I was investigating a story from a 1909 Phoenix news- paper article about the Smithsonian Institution's h aving excavated rock- cut vaults in the Grand Canyon where Egyptian artif acts had been dis- covered, and whether the Smithsonian Institution co uld give me any more information on the subject. \"Well, the first thing I can tell you, before we go any further,\" she said, \"is that no Egyptian artifacts of any kind have eve r been found in North or South America.

While it cannot be discounted that the entire story is an elaborate news- paper hoax, the fact that it was on the front page, named the prestigious Smithsonian Institution and gave a highly detailed story that went on for several pages, lends a great deal to its credibilit y. It is hard to believe such a story could have come out of thin air. Is the Smithsonian Institution covering up an archa eological discovery of immense importance? If this story is true it wou ld radically change the current view that there was no transoceanic contact in pre-Columbian times, and that all American Indians, on both conti nents, are descended from Ice Age explorers who came across the Bering S trait.

Poring over the map, we were amazed to see that much of th e area on the north side of the canyon has Egyptian names. The area aro und Ninety-four Mile Creek and Trinity Creek had areas (rock formations, apparently) with names like Tower of Set, Tower of Ra, Horus Temple, Osiris Temple, and Isis Temple. In the Haunted Canyon area were such n ames as the Cheops Pyramid, the Buddha Cloister, Buddha Temple, Manu T emple and Shiva Temple. Was there any relationship between these pl aces and the alleged Egyptian discoveries in the Grand Canyon? We called a state archaeologist at the Grand Canyon , and were told that the early explorers had just liked Egyptian and Hin du names, but that it was true that this area was off limits to hikers or other visitors, \"because of dangerous caves.\" Indeed, this entire area with the Egyptian and Hind u place names in the Grand Canyon is a forbidden zone—no one is allowed into this large area. We could only conclude that this was the area where the vaults were located. Yet today, this area is curiously off-limi ts to all hikers and even, in large part, park personnel.

E. Kinkaid, the explorer who found the great underground citadel of the Grand Canyon during a trip from Gree n river, Wyoming down the Colorado, in a wooden boat, to Yuma, sever al months ago. According to the story related to the Gazette by Mr . Kinkaid, the archae- ologists of the Smithsonian Institute, which is fin ancing the expeditions, have made discoveries which almost conclusively pro ve that the race which inhabited this mysterious cavern, hewn in sol id rock by human hands, was of oriental origin, possibly from Egypt, tracing back to Ramses.

The recent finds include articles whic h have never been known as native to this country, and doubtless they had their origin in the orient. War weapons, copper instruments, sharp- edged and hard as steel indicate the high state of civilization reach ed by these strange peo- ple. So interested have the scientists become that preparations are being made to equip the camp for extensive studies, and t he force will be increased to thirty or forty persons. \"Before going further into the cavern, better facil ities for lighting will have to be installed, for the darkness is dens e and quite impenetra- ble for the average flashlight.

How far this cavern extends no one can guess, but it is now the belief of many that what has already been e xplored is merely the 'barracks,' to use an American term, for the so ldiers, and that far into the underworld will be found the main communal dwel lings of the fam- ilies. The perfect ventilation of the cavern, the s teady draught that blows through, indicates that it has another outlet to th e surface.\" Mr. Kinkaid's Report Mr. Kinkaid was the first white child born in Idaho and has been an explorer and hunter all his life, thirty years havi ng been in the service of the Smithsonian Institute. Even briefly recounted, his history sounds fabulous, almost grotesque. \"First, I would impress that the cavern is nearly i naccessible. The entrance is 1,486 feet down the sheer canyon wall. It is located on gov- ernment land and no visitor will be allowed there u nder penalty of tres- pass.

One of these I stood up and photographed by flashlight. I gathered a number of relics, which I carried down the Colorado to Yum a, from whence I shipped them to Washington with details of the disc overy. Following this, the explorations were undertaken. The Passages \"The main passageway is about 12 feet wide, narrowi ng to nine feet toward the farther end. About 57 feet from the entr ance, the first side-passages branch off to the right and left, alo ng which, on both sides, are a number of rooms about the size of ordinary li ving rooms of today, though some are 30 by 40 feet square. These are ent ered by oval-shaped doors and are ventilated by round air spaces throug h the walls into the passages. The walls are about three feet six inches in thickness. The pas- sages are chiseled or hewn as straight as could be laid out by an engineer. The ceilings of many of the rooms converge to a cen ter. The side-pas- sages near the entrance run at a sharp angle from t he main hall but toward the rear they gradually reach a right angle in dire ction. The Shrine \"Over a hundred feet from the entrance is the cross -hall, several hundred feet long in which are found the idol, or image, of the people's god, sit- ting cross-legged, with a lotus flower or lily in e ach hand. The cast of the face is oriental, and the carving shows a skill ful hand and the entire is remarkably well preserved, as is everything is t his cavern. The idol almost resembles Buddha, though the scientists are not certain as to what religious worship it represents. Taking into c onsideration every- thing found thus far, it is possible that this wors hip most resembles the ancient people of Tibet. Surrounding this idol are smaller images, some very beautiful in form; others crooked-necked and d istorted shapes, symbolical, probably, of good and evil. There are t wo large cactus with protruding arms, one on each side of the dais on wh ich the god squats. All this is carved out of hard rock resembling marb le. In the opposite corner of this cross-hall were found tools of all d escriptions, made of copper. These people undoubtedly knew the lost art of hardening this metal, which has been sought by chemists for centur ies without result. On a bench running around the workroom was some cha rcoal and other material probably used in the process. There is als o slag and stuff simi- lar to matte, showing that these ancients smelted o res, but so far no 1 trace of where or how this was done has been discov ered, nor the origin of the ore. \"Among the other finds are vases or urns and cups o f copper and"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Unorthodox Science 225 gold, made very artistic in design. The pottery wor k includes enameled ware and glazed vessels. Another passageway leads t o granaries such as are found in the oriental temples. They contain see ds of various kinds. One very large storehouse has not yet been entered, as it is twelve feet high and can be reached only from above. Two copper hooks extend on the edge, which indicates that some sort of ladder was attached. These granaries are rounded, as the materials of which th ey are constructed, I think, is a very hard cement. A gray metal is also found in this cavern, which puzzles the scientists, for its identity has not been established. It resembles platinum. Strewn promiscuously over the f loor everywhere are what people call 'cats eyes,' a yellow stone of no great value. Each one is engraved with the head of the Malay type. The Hieroglyphics \"On all the urns, or walls over doorways, and table ts of stone which were found by the image are the mysterious hierogly phics, the key to which the Smithsonian Institute hopes yet to discov er. The engraving on the tablets probably has something to do with the r eligion of the people. Similar hieroglyphics have been found in southern A rizona. Among the pictorial writings, only two animals are found. One was of the prehis- toric type. The Crypt \"The tomb or crypt in which the mummies were found is one of the largest of the chambers, the walls slanting back at an angle of about 35 degrees. On these are tiers of mummies, each one oc cupying a separate hewn shelf. At the head of each is a small bench, o n which is found cop- per cups and pieces of broken swords. Some of the m ummies are cov- ered with clay, and all are wrapped in a bark fabri c.

Machetto, who was their chief, counseled them to leave the underworld , but there was no way out. The chief then caused a tree to grow up an d pierce the roof of the underworld, and then the people of one heart cl imbed out. They tar- ried by Paisisvai (Red River), which is the Colorad o, and grew grain and corn. They sent out a message to the Temple of the Sun, asking the blessing of peace, good will and rain for people of one heart. That mes- senger never returned, but today at the Hopi villag es at sundown can be seen the old men of the tribe out on the housetops gazing toward the sun, looking for the messenger. When he returns, their l ands and ancient dwelling place will be restored to them. That is th e tradition. Among the engravings of animals in the cave is seen the image of a heart over the spot where it is located. The legend was reamed by W.E. Rollins, the artist, during a year spent with the Hopi Indians. There are two theories of the origin of the Egyptians. One that they came from Asia, another that the racial cradle was in the upper Nile region . Heeren, an Egyptologist, believed in the Indian origin of the Egyptians.

But eventually the truth comes to the fore, and its ene mies are vanquished. Julius Hensel's pioneer work in opposing the use of chemicals in agri- culture, a half a century later, found rebirth in t he Organic Movement which has swept through the world. But Hensel is mo re modern than the most modern agricultural reformer, for he claimed, on the basis of theo- retical chemical considerations, and supported by p ractical tests, that his Stone Meal can replace not only chemical fertilizer s but all animal ones as well. It was the German agricultural chemist Liebig who f irst put forward the phosphorus-potash-nitrogen theory of chemical ferti lization. This false doctrine Hensel bitterly attacked and in so doing, won the ire of the finan- cial interests behind the sale of chemical fertiliz ers, which used agricul- tural authorities and university professors to deno unce poor Hensel as a charlatan and his Stone Meal as worthless. Though his fight against chemical fertilizers was a losing battle and he died as a defeated hero, it took a generation for H ensel's efforts to bear fruit in the modern Organic Movement, which has not given its founder the credit due him. The fight between Liebig, advocate [of] one-sided c hemical fertiliza- tion, and Hensel, who advocated a more balanced for m of plant nutrition, including the trace minerals which Liebig completel y overlooked, was a battle between an opportunist, who sought to furthe r the sales of chemical fertilizers, and a true scientist, interested in hu manity's welfare.

Liebig claimed that plants require three main eleme nts—nitrogen, phosphorus and potash—the basis of which conception chemical fertiliz- ers were manufactured that supplied these elements. On the other hand, Hensel claimed that plants need many more than thes e three major ele- ments, stressing the importance of the trace minera ls, which at that time were ignored. In place of chemical fertilizers, sup plying only three ele- ments in an unnatural, caustic form, Hensel recomme nded the bland min- erals of pulverized rocks, especially granite, a pr imordial rock which con- tains the many trace minerals that meet all needs o f plant nutrition. Hensel first made his discovery of powdered rock fe rtilization when he was a miller. One day, while milling grain, he noti ced that some stones were mixed with it and [he] ground [them] into a me al. He sprinkled this stone meal over the soil of his garden and was surp rised to note how the vegetables took on a new, more vigorous growth. Thi s led him to repeat the experiment by grinding more stones and applying the stone meal to fruit trees. Much to his surprise, apple trees that formerly bore wormy, imperfect fruit now produced fine quality fruit fre e from worms. Also vegetables fertilized by stone meal were free from insect pests and dis- eases. It seemed to be a complete plant food, which produced fine veg- etables even in the poorest soil. Encouraged by these results, Hensel put his \"Stone Meal\" on the mar- ket, and wrote extensively on its superiority over chemical fertilizers, while at the same time opposing the use of animal m anure, and the nitro- gen theory on which it is based, claiming that when plants are supplied with Stone Meal, plenty of water, air and sunshine, they will grow health- fully even if the soil is poor in nitrogen, since i t was his belief that plants derive their nitrogen through their leaves, and do not depend on the soil for this element. In opposing this use of chemical fertilizer, Hensel awoke the ire of a powerful enemy, which was resolved to liquidate him —the Chemical Trust. Through unfair competition, Hensel's \"Stone Meal\" business was destroyed and his product was taken off the market. However, the chief object of attack was his book, Bread From Stones, i n which he expound- ed his new doctrines of Liebig on which the chemica l fertilizer business was based, as well as the \"Liebig meat extract.\" (F or Hensel advocated vegetarianism, just as he advocated natural farming without chemicals or manure.) Accordingly, his enemies succeeded in supp ressing the further publication of this book and in removing it from li braries, until it became extremely rare and difficult to obtain. It is more fortunate that a surviving copy came into the writer's possession."},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Unorthodox Science 229 Dr. Julius Hensel was not only a student of agricul tural chemistry, but also biochemistry and nutrition, and he related all these sciences, and unit- ed them into a composite science of life, which he labeled \"Makro- biology.\" His theory was that the chemistry of life is basically determined by the chemistry of the soil, and that chemicals un balance and pervert soil chemistry while powdered rocks help restore normal soil mineral balance, producing foods favorable to health and life. His d iscoveries concerning the value of powdered rocks as soil conditioners an d plant foods, though rejected and ridiculed when he first proposed them, were adopted by agri- cultural science nearly a century later, when the a pplication of powdered limestone, rock phosphate and other rocks became st andard agricultural pratice. Granite, which Hensel recommended as the m ost balanced of all rocks as source of soil minerals, was first rejecte d as worthless, but later appreciated and used as a soil mineralizer. During the course of his researches, Dr. Hensel fou nd that in the primeval rocks, as granite, lie a potentially inexh austable supply of all minerals required for the feeding and regeneration of the soil, plants, ani- mals and man. All that is required is to reduce the m to finely a pulverized form, so that their mineral elements may be made av ailable to plants. Hensel wrote a book describing his discovery of a n ew method of creat- ing more perfect fruits and vegetables, rich in all nutritional elements and immune to disease and insect pests, with the result that it produced worm- free fruit without the need of spraying. The foods so produced by rock- meal fertilization were true Organic Super Foods, f ar superior in flavor and value than those produced under the forcing act ion of manure or chemical fertilizers. Hensel was the first to put up a fight against the then-growing new chemical fertilizer industry—a struggle that was co ntinued in the next century by Sir William Howard in England and J. I. Rodale in America. The use of chemical fertilizers, claimed Hensel, le ads to the following evil consequences: 1. It poisons the soil, destroying beneficial soil bac teria, earthworms and humus*. 2. It creates unhealthy, unbalanced, mineral-deficient plants, lacking resistance to disease and insect pests, thus leadin g to the spraying men- ace in an effort to preserve these defective specim ens. 3. It leads to diseases among animals and men who feed on these abnor- mal plants and their products. 4. It leads to a tremendous expense to the farmer, because chemical fer- * Decayed vegetable or animal matter that provides nutrients for plants."},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"230 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries tilizers, being extremely soluble, are quickly wash ed from the soil by rainfall and needs constant replacement. (Powdered rocks, on the other hand, being less soluble, are not so easily washed from the soil, but keep releasing minerals to it for many years). The use of various pulverized rocks, [such] as gran ite, limestone, rock phosphate, etc., in place of chemical fertilizers, will lead, claimed Hensel, to permanent restoration of even poor soils to the balanced mineral con- tent of the best virgin soils; and the rock dust th us applied will remain year after year and not be washed away by rains or irrig ation water, as is the case with highly soluble chemical fertilizers. This will be an economic saving to the grower and enable him to sell foods a t a lower price than when he must spend large sums on chemical fertilize rs. Also, since foods thus mineralized are healthy and immune to plant di seases and insect pests (as Hensel experimentally demonstrated), there is n o need for the expense and dangers of spraying.* Foods raised by Hensel's followers, including many German gardeners and farmers, who were enthusiastic in praise of his method, were found to possess firmer tissue and better shipping and keepi ng qualities than those raised with animal manure or chemicals. And most im portant among the advantages of Hensel's agricultural discovery is th at foods grown on min- eralized soil are higher both in mineral and vitami n content and so pro- duce better health and greater immunity to disease than those grown by the use of chemical fertilizer sprays. To kill insects by poisons applied to plants does n ot remove the cause of their infestation, and poisons both the insect a s well as the human con- sumer of the sprayed plant. Only correct feeding of the soil, and conse- quently of plants by trees, by proper methods of fe rtilization, thereby keeping them well-nourished, vigorous and free from disease, will accom- plish this, for insects do not seem to attack healt hy plants. It appears that insects, like scavengers, attack chiefly unhealthy and demineralized plants, not healthy ones. Dr. Charles Northern has performed experiments in which he raised two tomato plants, entwined with each other, in differ- ent pots, one being supplied with an abundance of t race minerals, derived from colloidal phosphate, and the other just chemic al fertilizer. The toma- to plant grown with chemical fertilizer alone was a ttacked by insects, while the other one given trace minerals was not. Hensel pointed out that animal manure and chemical fertilizers produce a forced, unnaturally rapid growth of large-sized p roduce which fail to acquire the minerals normally secured during a slow er, longer develop- ment. The result is the production of demineralized , unbalanced plants, * Editor's Note: Rock phosphate from some sources c ontains a high level of the toxic mineral cadmium .

This explains why, coincident with the increased us e of chemical fertiliz- ers, during the past century, insect pests steadily increased. So did can- cerous conditions among plants, animals and humans, as shown by Keens, an English soil chemist, who presents statistics to show that the increased use of chemical fertilizers is a major cause of the greater incidence of can- cer during that last hundred years. The modern Organic Farming movement has accepted an d propagated one of Hensel's theories—his opposition to chemical fertilizers and rec- ommendation of powdered rocks in their place—but ha s failed to appre- ciate his other main doctrine—his opposition to the use of animal excre- ments as plant foods. In this respect, Hensel, thou gh he lived in the last century, [was] far ahead of the Organic Movement an d more modern than the most modern agricultural reformer. Hensel had a great admirer and disciple in England, one Sampson Morgan, who founded his \"Clean Culture\" doctrine on Hensel's philoso- phy of soil and biological regeneration by the avoi dance of chemical or animal fertilizers. While Hensel was more of a theo rist, Morgan was a practical farmer and agricultural experimenter, who proved the truth of Hensel's theories by winning the first prize at all agricultural exhibits at which his super-sized, super-quality, disease- and blight-free rock-dust fertilized fruits and vegetables were displayed. In Sampson Morgan's Clean Culture, Morgan's views are presented. In rea lity they are Hensel's doctrines transplanted to English soil. The reading of Morgan's book will be a valuable supplement to [the reading] of this, to give one a thorough understanding of the subject of Natural Agriculture (i.e., a system of soil culture definitely in advance of Organic Garde ning by the compost method). Practical experience with Hensel's Stone Meal and h is non-animal method of soil regeneration, has proven the followi ng: 1. That Stone Meal creates healthier, tastier, more vi taminized and min- eralized foods. 2. That Stone Meal creates immunity to insect infestat ion, worms, fungi and plant diseases of all kinds. 3. That Stone Meal improves the keeping and shipping q uality of foods, so that they keep a long time, in contrast to the r apid deterioration of foods given abundant animal manure. 4. That Stone Meal helps plants to resist drought and frost, enabling them to survive when those fed on manure and chemicals p erish."},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"232 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries 5. That Stone Meal produces larger crops which are mor e profitable because the farmer is saved the expense of buying c hemical fertilizers which are rapidly leached from the soil by rainfall , whereas Stone Meal, being less soluble, is gradually released dur ing the course of years and remain in the soil, being the most econom ical of fertilizers. 6. That foods raised with Stone Meal are better for hu man health and the prevention of disease than those grown with che micals or animal manure. 7. That use of Stone Meal, in place of chemical or ani mal fertilizers, helps to end the spraying menace (by removing its cause) is proven by the fact that plants and trees grown with Stone Meal ar e immune to pests and so require no spraying."},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"Scientist With an Attitude: Wilhelm Reich Jeane Manning Federal employees worked with a vengeance when inst ructed to destroy the work of scientist Wilhelm Reich, M.D., at his l aboratory in the state of Maine.

The freight truck du mped the papers at a Lower Manhattan incinerator, for an FDA-ordered boo k burning.

Granted, Wilhelm Reic h was brought to court because another physician transported Reich's orgone accumulators across state lines in defiance of a federal FDA ord er. Reich believed the courts had no mandate to judge basic scientific res earch nor to order him to destroy his life's work, so he returned to his l aboratory and continued his writings. As a result of his attitude, he was f ined heavily for contempt of court, sentenced to two years and four months, j ailed despite his heart condition, and later died in prison just before he was eligible for parole. So far, the story is comprehensible even though it is tragic. But why do writers even today deflect attention from Reich's m ost important dis- coveries related to a cosmic life force—weather con trol, and the Oranur demonstration of the dangerous effects of atomic ra diation? Even aca- demics who present themselves as researchers publis h distortions of Reich's ideas. Reich's biographers, W. Edward Mann and Edwa rd Hoffman, point to a 1980 textbook which has sixteen factual errors in two pages on Reich. \"Most of them are vicious distortions . . . feeding the notion that Reich was either a quack or a nut.\" Other writers, aiming for popular publications, loo k for ridiculous if not lewd material. Out of the remains of forty years of published opinions, per- sonal correspondence and spontaneous statements fro m a prolific, coura- geous freethinker, it is not hard for a skeptic to find a few items which can be presented as amusing. A continual barrage of suc h ridicule put Reich down in popular history mainly as a psychiatrist an d \"sex doctor.\" The labels do not do justice to Reich. His well-kno wn studies of orgas- mic potential (measurements of bio-electric charge correlated with emo- tions reported by patients) were only a part of the evolution of his work. Each step of his career—from being Sigmund Freud's most promising disciple who worked out how neuroses show up in the human body, to uncovering the pathology of fascism, to discovering entities under the microscope which he claimed were links between the non-living and the living—led him toward wide-ranging findings about t he primordial sub- stratum that he called orgone. He found it moving i n living organisms and everywhere, saw it pulsating in \"bions\" under the m icroscope and glow- ing in the dark of an orgone accumulator. In the un polluted oceans and atmosphere the energy could be seen in the blue col our and lively sparkle. It is attracted to water but recoils from certain m anmade factors. His later discoveries about the pre-atomic atmospheric substr atum, and their impli- cations for health and the environment, dwarfed any of his earlier work which led up to them. In addition to the question of why detractors still try to diminish Reich, another nagging question remains: Why did the Unite d States government burn his soft cover books and papers wholesale? The fires destroyed piles"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Unorthodox Science 235 of copies of twenty books and journals. Crate after crate of his life's work was rounded up wherever it could be found, and haul ed away into the fur- naces. Decades of scientific journals and publicati ons on politics, psychi- atry, education, sociology, sexology, microbiology, meteorology and other disciplines were reduced to ashes. WHO FELT THREATENED? Some observers wonder if his free-energy invention played a part in the squashing of his scientific writings and the oblite ration of his reputation. Reich claimed that he could power an electric motor with concentrated atmospheric energy. Did economic interests want to crush that possibility? Or was he correct in seeing the opposition to be mo re psychological— a gut-level reaction by what he called anti-life \"a rmoured\" people who are in denial of his life-affirming discoveries? Did me chanistic-minded peo- ple, in positions of power, fear being shown that t hey and the earth itself and the universe are filled with streamings of a vi brant, pulsating unpre- dictable life force? Reich's experiments indicated that this living force could actually be measured in terms such as heat or movement, and that it is present in varying degrees depending on sickness or health of the organ- ism. And that this life-giving substratum is bother ed by high-voltage power grids and is in effect irritated into a frenz y by unnatural levels of nuclear radioactivity. A third possibility is that the unprecedented oppos ition came from the orthodox medical community. The orgone accumulator, central to Reich's legal troubles, was a simple medical-treatment box which concentrated the previously-unknown energy by a certain layering of absorbent organ- ic and reflective inorganic materials. Experiments showed an anomalous rise in temperature inside the box, and even Albert Einstein had experi- enced this phenomenon under Reich's tutoring. Altho ugh Reich himself never claimed that the accumulator cured cancer, pa tients of a number of physicians reported that they were helped with vari ous conditions by sit- ting in an accumulator or being treated with a smal ler accumulator called a shooter. The FDA had worked for years on the case before she riff's officers finally led Reich in handcuffs to a small courthous e in Maine. At his trial for contempt of court, he defended himself but was not allowed to bring testimony about the medical effectiveness of the or gone accumulator nor even to explain \"orgone.\" Myron R. Sharif, Ph.D., l ater wrote about the trial and said the moment when fundamental issues s tood out searingly was when FDA agent Joseph Maguire scornfully referr ed to Reich's dis- covery of a primal energy:"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"236 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries They talk about pre-atomic energy! What's that? We' ve moved way beyond that—we've got A-energy and now we are getti ng H-energy [the H-bomb]. Sharif and others knew that when atomic bombs were being tested, Reich's orgone experiments would become disturbed. Measurements inside the accumulators would swing strangely, whic h he said showed a seething reaction in the life-field of the earth af ter atomic testing. Apparently sick at heart over what he saw as its tr agic outcome, Sharif reported that the trial discussed meaningless secon dary issues while it avoided Reich's scientific evidence. Probably the j udge and jury were not capable of grasping a radically different world vie w—new understanding of a universal force—during the short span of time of a court battle. Reich had plenty of time afterward to reflect on ho w his life reached such a distressing low point. REICH IN DANGER Born in the Ukrainian part of Austria, Reich's inte rest in biology began on his father's farm, where he lived until the First W orld War drew him into the Austrian army for three years. He began his for mal education by studying law, switching to medicine and then specia lising in psycho- analysis. He was one of Sigmund Freud's inner circl e in Vienna in the 1920s, seen as Freud's most brilliant pupil and per haps successor. About the time he became a political activist, he edged a way from tradition- al Freudian methods of psychoanalysis. Revealing th e independence of thinking that he kept all his life, he began to dev elop his own systems of therapy. He worked in Berlin in the early 1930s. Still resis ting Fascism, he had joined the German Communist Party and was a member of a cell block of brave writers and artists. They met in secret while Nazi storm troopers marched the streets. As the decade went on and the Nazis took over Germany, Reich was in increasing danger from Hitler 's officers. He had been born of Jewish parents, was a psychiatrist and a Communist—three identities which Hitler hated. At the same time Reich was studying Fascism and con cluding that worsening social situations did not make people swi ng to the left politi- cally. Instead, he noticed that fear of freedom led people to cling to authority figures who promised a better life. The same year that Hitler came to power in Germany, 1933, Reich courageously published The Mass Psychology of Fasci sm. In February a student organization invited him to Copenhagen, Den mark, to lecture on Sexual Reform and Social Crisis.

Re ich's friends either went underground, or were arrested or shot. Disguis ed as a tourist on a ski holiday to Austria, Reich escaped to Austria. The psycho-analytic society there was hostile to Re ich's views, how- ever, and after two months he emigrated to Denmark. Later that year he was excluded from the Danish Communist party, which he had never joined. One reason for the exclusion was that an ar ticle of Reich's on sex education caused a furore. Then he had argued with party officials who were supposed to help immigrants and who turned awa y a suicidal young immigrant who lacked the proper papers, and Reich m ade a scene in his protest against the inhumane episode. A third strik e against Reich was that he had started a publishing house without the permission of the Communist Party. Fourthly, his book The Mass Psycho logy of Fascism was considered counter-revolutionary. WITHOUT A COUNTRY Despite such experiences, Reich continued to be int ellectually honest throughout his life, regardless of consequences. Th rough no fault of his own, much of his vision of a sexual revolution—towa rd a maturity in people—was lost in what actually happened in societ y. He would be opposed to pornography, with its emphasis on perver se, infantile and destructive elements. Biographer David Boadella sai d Reich wanted to take away barriers to \"re-emergence of a truly pers onalized sexuality that could deepen and enrich people's lives so fully tha t 'trips' to a heightened consciousness on drugs would be . . . irrelevant. . .\" In studying the relation between sexuality and anxi ety, Reich the psy- choanalyst developed a theory which considered the orgasm in terms of increase of surface electrical tension followed by a decrease. This avenue of study led him to look at plasma movements in one -celled animals. They too followed rhythms of reaching out toward the wor ld and then retreating. In the last month of that year the Danish Minister of Justice refused to renew Reich's residence permit, because of accusati ons by psychiatrists who did not agree with Reich's unorthodox writings. He relocated across the three-mile strait to Malmo, Sweden, and many of his Danish students began to commute by boat. But two Copenhagen psychi atrists contacted their counterparts in Sweden, and Swedish and Danis h police co-operated in keeping watch on Reich and his students. City po lice searched his home in Malmo without a warrant. No charges were laid ag ainst Reich or his students, but again his residence permit was not re newed.

In 1934 the 13th International Congress of Psycho- analysis expelled Reich, the man whom Sigmund Freud had titled \"the founder of the modern technique in psycho-analysis. \" In the mid- and late 1930s Reich was a refugee in N orway, after accept- ing the invitation of a professor he knew in Oslo. As a psychoanalyst Reich continued to develop new techniques for releasing b locked emotions. The human potential movement and today's bodywork thera pies can be traced back to Reich. BIO-ELECTRIC ORGANISMS While in Norway he first discovered what he called \"bions,\" a micro- scopic form of particles which Reicheans say are a transitional form between non-living material and living organisms. T he scientific commu- nity refused to accept his reports of spontaneous g eneration of life, nor his contention that as long as medical scientists study dead tissue, their under- standing of living organisms will remain limited. His previous work led up to the discovery. His prof essor friend had made facilities at the Psychological Institute of O slo University available to Reich, and Reich had turned to an assistant ther e for help on measuring electrical charges of the skin. He wanted to confir m his bio-electric con- cepts. Again he was a pioneer. Out of his earnings from lectures, Reich paid for t he building of sensi- tive new apparatus with electrodes and vacuum tubes connected to an oscillograph.* Mainly, Reich confirmed his tensions -charge theory and the theory that the organism worked like an electro lytic system, and that it has a continuous bio-electric field of excitatio n between nerve centers in the middle of the body and the skin surface. The holistic aspect of his work was important; for the first time in this way a scientist showed the organism to be a whole i n which disturbance of one part affects it all. The bio-electric experi ments showed the presence of one bio-psychological energy. His earlier work h ad indicated the ener- gy being dammed up and then released in the body, a nd now his instru- ments showed pleasure causing an increase of measur able charge and dis- pleasure causing decrease of bio-electric charge. The prolific researcher was about to master yet ano ther area of science. He wanted to study processes of expansion and contr action and corre- sponding bio-electric charges in protozoa—primitive forms of life.

In 1936 time-lapse photography of protozoa was a new i dea, but Reich never let that stop him. His critics could not understand why he wanted high- magnification microscopes, since there was an upper limit above which the subject would become increasingly blurry. But h e wanted to study movement within the protozoa, not the fine details of form. A series of accidental or experimental changes in p rocedures led to his amazing discovery of moving lifelike forms which co uld be grown in cul- tures and developed from a variety of apparently no n-living materials put in solutions which caused microscopic particles to swell. Artificially-cre- ated tiny blue-green vesicles (sacks) which he name d \"bions\" grew in sterilized preparations of materials such as coal o r sand. Under high mag- nification the vesicles could be seen in rolling, p ulsating, rotating and merging movements. In controlled experiments he pro ved that the bions could not have appeared as a result of infection fr om the air. While looking at bion cultures under the microscope , his eyes were burned by a non-nuclear radiation from them that he later found in the atmosphere. It was not the type of radiation known to physics. Instead, it corresponded more to the Hindu concept of prana or to the Chinese con- cept of chi. This is when he named it orgone—energy of the organism. It is a biological radiation, not electromagnetic, and an Oslo radiologist con- firmed that no standard nuclear radiation was prese nt in the bion culture. In the dark, the cultures glowed with a vague greyi sh-blue light. Reich also studied cancer tissue at high magnificat ion and showed a leading cancer researcher some moving cancer cells from living tissue. The researcher took the tissue back to his own labo ratory, performed the usual procedures which killed cells by drying and s taining them, then in a smug tone reported that he had \"controlled\" Reich's experiment and found Reich's bions to be \"only staphylococci.\" He appare ntly did not follow Reich's procedures, however. Reich continued to follow the path which now leads into research on cancer pathology. Eminent Norwegians started a news paper campaign against his work in all his fields of interest, and once again influential psy- chiatrists pressed a government to kick Reich out o f their country—this time by changing licensing regulations. By now the furore had nothing to do with his former interest in Communism; he had se en it for what it is and became vehemently anti-communist. In the middle of Reich's intense study of bions, he had to quickly pack up his labor atory equipment. On the last boat out of Norway before World War II, Re ich again emigrated to another country."},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"240 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries SIXTH NEW START After he arrived in the United States, Reich settle d with his third wife in a rented house on Long Island, New York. The baseme nt was used for experiments, the dining room transformed into a lab oratory and the maid's room into an office/preparation room for laboratory cultures. Psy- chotherapy took place in what had been an extra bed room. Reich further made a living by lecturing at the New School for So cial Research as asso- ciate professor of medical psychology until 1941. During those years Reich's research focus was on ca ncer and on radia- tion properties of his bions. To make certain that it was not only his own per- ceptions, he had his assistants stand in the dark a nd pick out test tubes which had a bluish glimmer of radiating bion cultures. Ac cidentally from a rubber glove incident he had found that organic materials absorbed the radiation. His next experiment was to design an enclosure of m etal to prevent leakage of the radiation from cultures. He lined th e experimental boxes on the outside with organic materials—cotton or wood. The experiment was controlled by an identical metal box which was empt y of bion cultures. To his surprise, the [empty] control box luminated as if it held radiating cul- tures itself. It appeared to pull the same type of radiation from the very air. From the experiments with experiencing a lumination visually, he went on to discover that heat concentrated in the box. I t felt like the warmth and prickling which bion cultures produced on skin ... He then learned that metal attracted the unusual radiation and then reflected it away, to be absorbed by the organic materials. He then designed an accumulator with a glass window behind which a thermometer could be inserted. An identical thermom eter at the same height outside the box measured room temperature. Reich fo und the accumulator was always about a half a degree Celsius warmer tha n surrounding air. What it meant was that the life force he had previo usly found in bion cultures could be collected from the atmosphere by an orgone accumula- tor. In its one-layer form, it is a wooden box line d with sheet metal. It works like a one-way grid for the orgone, as in the greenhouse effect where a radiation is allowed to enter but is reflec ted back inside faster than it exits, and the concentration builds up. He and his associates learned they could sit inside the box, soak up a gr eater charge of life force than they could by sitting outside, and improve the ir health. Among the experiments done with the accumulator, on e type showed that an electroscope* discharges more slowly inside it. This could not be explained by the current theory on atmospheric elec tricity. Other experi- ments showed body temperature of people sitting ins ide the accumulator * An apparatus for detecting an electric charge."},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Unorthodox Science 241 rose anomalously. Control experiments eliminated al l standard explana- tions for the temperature rise. To follow what Reich was doing, he said, a scientis t would have to drop all the intellectual baggage that's connected to th e Second Law of Thermo- dynamics. Otherwise, \"he will not understand the te mperature difference; he will feel inclined to do away with it as only he at convection or ... this or that. He will fail to see its orgonomic, atmosph eric significance.\" Believers in the hypothesis of empty space likewise would not understand that a vacuum could light up and that the effect ca n vary with weather changes, Reich said. In the orgone accumulator, heat is not produced out of nothing, Reich said, but rather the moving orgone within it is sto pped by the accumula- tor's inner wall or the palm of a hand, and is then expressed as heat. Reich's bion experiments continued, including one t ype which showed fogging on X-ray plates from the bions' radiation. ACCUMULATOR TO ORANUR Over the following years Reich's patients reported that the orgone accu- mulator was helpful in treating many types of disor ders such as arthritis, and especially cancer. He never claimed it was a cu re for cancer, but somehow he gained the reputation of having claimed this. He moved from New York to a small rural community, Rangeley, Maine, and set up an institute he called Orgonon. T hroughout the 1940s he researched the orgone as well as kept up a pract ice and publishing his own journal The International Journal of Sex Econom y and Orgone Research. Reich also reported discovering the motor force—he claimed that enough energy was collected in an orgone accumulato r to run an electric motor about the size of an orange. Plans for the mo tor were never pub- lished because he said humanity was not ready. As w ith all orgone phe- nomena, such as the accumulator, the orgone motor v aried with the weath- er. Today, the Wilhelm Reich museum has a film of t he motor. The saga at Orgonon took a frightening turn when in 1951 Reich tried putting a small amount of radioactive material—radi um—in an orgone accumulator. His hypothesis was that powerful orgon e would wipe out the bad effects of nuclear radiation. He was wrong. Som e unknown force, dif- ferent and more powerful than the radioactive mater ial itself, went crazy. The reaction of an area highly charged with orgone and then exposed to radioactivity caused a local disaster; Reich's \"ora nur\" experiment contami- nated his laboratory, killed mice which he had in t he laboratory for experi- ments and made everyone at the institute quite sick , including Reich, who fainted several times in the sickening atmosphere c aused by the experiment."},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"242 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries One worker nearly passed out when he stuck his head in the accumulator. Rocks on the fireplace crumbled mysteriously. Grani te sticking out of the ground several hundred yards away in the infected a rea blackened. Dark, dull clouds hung overhead for days. The cloud s seemed to be connected with an anti-life effect, and people's he alth worsened in their personal weak areas. For several weeks, radiation c ounts measured on Geigercounters in a radius of 300 miles from Orgono n were unusually high. Reich did his best to wash and decontaminate the building and surrounding area, but it took a long time and cause d much stress to the people at Orgonon. CLOUDBUSTER The disaster had a side effect. In an effort to cle ar the depressing clouds from the area, Reich invented the device he later c alled the cloudbuster. It is made simply—from hollow metal tubes pointed at a n angle at the sky and grounded at the other end in flowing water, bec ause water attracts the life force. The bundle of pipes is said to draw org one out of the sky wher- ever it is pointed. Why would Reich want to do that? He and his associa tes would reply that radioactive fallout and other pollutants turn the lively natural-state orgone into a stale, stagnant, dead form of orgone which he called DOR, which stands for Deadly Orgone Radiation. He said D OR is a factor in causing droughts by inhibiting rain and cloud forma tion. One theory of cloudbusting is that by drawing the DOR out of the sky with a cloudbuster and then getting the healthy orgone moving again, t he atmosphere returns to its natural cycles which include rain. For several years he researched what could be done with a cloudbuster to change weather, and said he learned how to raise the energetic level of the surrounding atmosphere instead of just decrease it. When he took his cloudbusting equipment to Arizona, events became re ally strange, includ- ing alleged experiences with UFOs. Reich's journal of his 1954 journey reveals an unusual ability to sense the natural lan dscape and its moods, similar to the awareness and sensitivities of abori ginal peoples. Reich viewed the cloudbusting operation as benefici al, bringing rain to the southwest in January 1955. One morning in Tucso n there was so much rain that planes were unable to land at the airport . The previous weeks, he reported prairie grass had sprouted in the desert u ntil in December 1954 the grass was a foot high on land that had been barren as long as anyone living could remember. This work was not as well documente d, perhaps because of the distractions of a coming showdown with the g overnment agents. Meanwhile, the United States Food and Drug Administ ration gathered a case against his use of the orgone accumulator fo r therapy. The FDA and"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Unorthodox Science 243 medical profession did not believe that it worked, and labelled it quack- ery. In 1954 the FDA ordered his [Reich's] hardcove r books banned from circulation and his softcover books, including all his periodicals, burned. It also ordered him to stop making and distributing orgone accumulators. For refusing to obey the injunction against publish ing, Reich was sen- tenced to two years in jail. He died in prison in 1 957, shortly before he would have been eligible for parole. STILL IGNORED BY MAINSTREAM Years later, mainstream science has not accepted bi ons or Reich's more important findings regarding the atmosphere. An org one accumulator sits in the St. Louis Museum of Quackery. However, small groups in several countries carry on the work. Some European health p ractitioners openly use orgone accumulators. A scientist and former wea ther forecaster, Dr. Charles R. Kelley, wrote A New Method of Weather Co ntrol in 1960 and published the only periodical related to Reich's wo rk in the years just af- ter Reich's death, up until 1965. Another of Reich' s students, the late Elsworth F. Baker, M.D., founded the American Colle ge of Orgonomy and began the Journal of Orgonomy about a decade af ter Reich's death. Headquarters of the small college are now in Prince ton, New Jersey. It consists of a group of academics—mostly psychiatris ts. The Wilhelm Reich museum at Rangeley, Maine, is open to the pub lic in summer. Unfortunately, his will specified that his archives be sealed in a vault until the year 2007. He hoped that a new generation would seriously look at his work without feeling the need to squash it. Over the years, some of Reich's publicly-stated vie ws, such as his McCarthy-era accusations that certain government ag ents were Red Fascists, his claims of UFO-related experience, or his advocacy of ado- lescent sexual freedom, have been an embarrassment to followers who otherwise want to carry on his work. Some of them c laim that, in his last few years of his life, Reich's loneliness and the c umulative effects of his experiences became too heavy. From around 1955 unti l his death in 1957, says biographer Boadella, \"the paranoid ideas ran a longside perfectly rational concepts and insights.\" The best of Reich's discoveries live on, although n ot publicized in mainstream media. A handful of individuals in vario us countries have continued to learn about \"etheric weather modificat ion.\" Such experi- mentation with atmospheric processes is not to be t aken lightly, according to practitioners. In fact, they say that irresponsi ble cloudbusting opera- tions can contribute to destructive weather instead of restoring the weath- er's natural rhythms. There had been a unifying thread spun by Re i c h 's va ried research; most"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"244 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries of his findings related to a central discovery. The growing thread of evi- dence pointed to reality of Life Force which can be scientifically demon- strated. It led to Reich's findings that, when the atmospheric life force over a large area has been assaulted too much, it l ocks into an immobile state of drought-causing stagnant air. A Reichean-oriented scientist in Michigan and other s add a sombre note about degradation of the atmosphere. Herman Me inke of the Detroit area estimated in 1993 that the life force in the a tmosphere is only about one/fortieth of the strength which it was during Re ich's experiments. He has been repeating the experiments for many years, and found that they no longer show results which they did previously. He b lames the prolifera- tion of nuclear testing and nuclear power plants fo r weakening the plan- et's atmospheric life force. REICH PARALLELS SCHAUBERGER Reich's biographers hint that squashing of writings about a dynamic atmospheric force in the 1950s was related to the f act that the atomic power industry was emerging at that time; it would not do for the public to debate whether atomic fission and its byproducts turns life force in the environment into a destructive presence which R eich called Deadly Orgone Radiation. Nor would the atomic power indust ry want people to connect droughts and anomalous weather with atmosph eric DOR. Reich's contemporary and fellow Austrian, Viktor Schauberge r, also had an advanced understanding of what he saw as an energy whose life could be blown apart by proliferation of atomic radiation in the atmosphere. Like Schauberger, Reich also learned from observing nature. When Reich published photographs of trees dying from the tops downward because of poisoning of the biosphere—what he calle d the falling of DOR onto the trees—he was one of the first scientists t o warn that the planet could become a lifeless wasteland. His work indicat ed that the life force within an organism is stimulated by outer orgone in the atmosphere. Has the weakening of the life force in the atmosphere b y pollution, been reflect- ed within humanity and other species? The many weak ened immune sys- tems—from cancers in sea life to AIDS in humans—pre sents a strong clue. Reich's followers today say that Reichean methods t o break up block- ages in the atmosphere can help save the day, if th e causes of Deadly Orgone Radiation are also removed. (Reich said the causes include treat- ment of babies and children which perpetuates an em otional desert in humanity.) His followers describe a scenario of atm ospheric medicine, including cloudbusters, renewed vi tali t y in the air and in organisms, and greening of deserts."},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Unorthodox Science 245 To the end of his life, Reich was close friends wit h English educator A.

If you could s omehow quantify and accurately ascribe human pain and needless sufferin g, then the pernicious legacy of Morris Fishbein, M.D. (1889-1976) of the American Medical Association (AMA) would exceed in villainous ignomi ny the legacies of Hitler and Stalin combined. While a more subtle and quiet offence which may pass unnoticed in the historical moment, ideoci de is ultimately, in its continually expansive accumulative enormity, a far more pernicious crime against all humanity than any \"simple\" genocide. Wh en a genocide indict- ment is finally issued, it contains specifics: date s of onset, locations, dura- tion, victim identity lists. But who can name the v ictims or measure the pain that marks Fishbein's ideocidal career? Indeed , when can we even end the tally? If the only adduced instance of Fishbein's ideocide were the persistent, obsessive persecution of Colonial Dinshah Ghadiali, M.D., D.C., Ph.D., L.L.D., from 1924 to 1958 and the attempted eradica tion of his Spectro- Chrome Therapy (SCT) both from practice and from pr int, it would trag- ically suffice to make my point. Popular history would have us believe that the (now scandalously) shocking FDA-instigated incineration of the printed works of Dr. William Reich was an unprecedented and isolated event in th ese United States of alleged First Amendment protections. However, the dubious distinction of having been the first Federal book- burn victim belongs to Dinshah. Ten years previousl y, in 1947, in compli- ance with a Federal Court order, he had to \"surrend er for destruction\" his unique library and all printed material pertaining to coloured light therapies to U.S. marshals in Camden, New Jersey. All during those years he remained steadfastly dedicated to truth in the healing arts, and to his personal vision of an earnest, energetic, open America (a vision he fo rmed some fifty years ear-"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"248 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries lier on his first visit). The source of this resili ency is found in part in his often-repeated motto: \"Truth can be defeated, never conquered.\" In the better-known case of Dr. Reich, the very bar barity of the assault itself added to his mystique, impairing a legendary martyrdom and ensur- ing an elevated niche in history independent of the content or validity of his science. In contrast, very few, even among prac titioners of the alter- native disciplines, know the story of SCT despite t he uninterrupted efforts of the Dinshah Health Society, established and run by his son Darius Dinshah on the original 23-acre Malaga, New Jersey estate. Operating under the strict confines of the final 1958 Food an d Drug Administration (FDA) injunction, which is still in effect, SCT has somehow survived to enjoy the modicum of legitimacy conferred by the 19 94 recognition and listing (as an information source only) of SCT by t he United States Office of Alternative Medicine. Fortunately for us, the core of the system (any pro jected light source except fluorescent, plus 12 coloured filters) is so low-tech, and the \"tona- tion\" application formulations—laboriously determin ed and charted by Dinshah—are so simple that the ease of home assembl y and utilisa- tion allows for convenient accessibility. (See diag ram of the Spectro- Chrome Therapeutic System on p. 262.) Unfortunately for Dinshah (the \"Ghadiali\" was dropped in America), it was precisel y this low-tech ac- cessibility and therapeutic efficacy which made him an irresistible and inevitable target for Fishbein and the healing-for- money establishment. Born in Bombay, India, in 1873 to a Parsee watchmak er of Persian descent (the Zoroastrian faith to which he adhered is often referred to as \"the Faith of Light\"), Dinshah's special genius and industry soon became apparent. He began primary school at age three, and high school at eight. By his eleventh year he was an assistant to the Pro fessor of Mathematics and Science at Wilson College, Bombay. His father d id not encourage his early fascination with electricity, and Dinshah tol d of sneaking downstairs to study through the night, retiring for a few hour s of sleep shortly before dawn when he and his father would arise together. H e took his university exams at fourteen, winning proficiency awards in En glish, Persian and religion. (In his spare time, he was to achieve com petence in eight orien- tal and eight occidental languages.) The following year he divided his time between givi ng demonstrations in physics and chemistry and meeting the demands of running a success- ful electric doorbell/burglar alarm installation bu siness. It was also the year he began his medical studies. At eighteen, having mastered the practice of Yoga S hasira and having been awarded a fellowship by The Theosophical Socie ty, he added spiri- tual subjects to his oratorial repertoire. His repu tation and experience"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Unorthodox Science 249 as an electrical engineer earned an appointment as Superintendent of Telephone and Telegraph for Dholar state. Three yea rs later found him serving as Electrical Engineer of Patiala state and Mechanical Engineer for the Umbala Flour Mill. His medical studies completed, in 1896 Dinshah made his first trip to America, where he lectured on X-rays and radioac tivity, meeting Tesla, Edison and other scientific notables. A darl ing of the press, Dinshah was affectionately referred to by The New Y ork Times as \"the Parsee Edison.\" The freedoms, the opportunities, the stimulating in tellectual energies he perceived in pre-war America left him with an in spired, compas- sionate optimism that future events could not dilut e. Upon his return to India he became a social reformer and the first pub lisher/editor of The Impartial, a weekly founded \"to further the cau se of freedom in speech and writing.\" The year 1897 was to prove pivotal, for it was the year Dinshah became the first person in India to apply and thus effect a cure for disease in accor- dance with the hypotheses of Dr. Edwin D. Babbitt ( as in his book, The Principles of Light and Color, University Books, Ne w Hyde Park, NY, 1876, reprinted 1967) and Dr. Seth Pancost (Blue an d Red Light, or Light and Its Rays as Medicine, 1877). During the plague years of the early 1900s, Dinshah 's eclectic and unorthodox ministrations effected a 60 percent reco very rate, in contrast to the 40 percent recovery expectations of conventi onal medical practice. Responding to an influential Theosophist friend's u rgent summons, Dinshah, from his supervisory position in a major l ight installation sever- al hundred miles away from central India, travelled to the bedside of his aunt who was dying from mucosa colitis (dysentery). Upon arrival, Dinshah faced several handicaps. The attending phys ician of record was a prominent Parsee and the Honorary Surgeon of no les s than a personage than the Viceroy of India. The old woman revered hi m as a demigod, but contemptuously referred to Dinshah as \"that kid doc tor.\" For three days he had to watch silently as her heal th continued to fail rapidly under a brutal but conventional medicinal r egimen. Although the regimen was well thought out and in conformity with the best recommen- dations of The British Pharmacopaedia, Dinshah saw that the opium administered for the pain was stressful to the hear t; the catechu, although a good astringent, was a peristalsis inhibitor; the chalk, intended as a binder, was an intestinal irritant; the bismuth sub nitrate, a local antiseptic, choked the alimentary canal; and the anti-flatulent chloroform was escharating damaged tissue. As Dinshah noted:"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"250 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries Thus she stayed two days more, drinking the poisono us concoction. On the third day she was in such a condition that she lifted her hands to me and implored me, \"O, Dinshah, save me!\" Medically s he was beyond recovery and I said with a sigh, \"Call on the Almig hty to save you. Dear girl, I have no power, no medicine of which I know I can be of service to you, but if you let me I shall endeavor to do the b est otherwise.\" She nodded her consent and I promptly threw out the dru g mixture ... I brought [indigo-] coloured pickle bottles to act as the slides . . . Within 24 hours the [100 daily bowel evacuations] were red uced to four a day; within 48 hours they came down to two; the third da y Jerbanoo was out of bed! Reflecting an Eastern patience and restraint, and r eflecting the slower technological pace of a pre-electronic age, Dinshah did not rush impetu- ously into print. However, before he could publicly promote SCT he had to be satisfied that he could exercise confident co ntrol of the procedure. Thus Dinshah embarked on a lengthy theoretical rese arch project, pro- ducing remarkably precise and accurate tonation for mulations. By 1904, at Ajmer and Surat, he had established \"El ectro-Medical Halls\" for the promotion of colour therapy research , magneto- and elec- tro-therapeutic approaches as well as orthodox medi cine. However, early on he was forced to abandon the otherwise promising electric modalities due to frequent episodes of nerve anastomosis and t he inherent and insur- mountable problems he encountered with \"unmanageabl e and freaky cur- rents.\" In 1908 he left India to promote his inventions thr ough Europe, even- tually, in 1911, dropping anchor in the United Stat es with his (first) wife and two children. He loved America and vigorously e mbraced the princi- ples and politics of an open democracy. However, th e same cannot be said of his wife who, in reaction to her early years of impoverishment and per- haps more than a little culture-shocked, returned a lone to India. Dinshah was so taken by his vision of a Walt Whitma n/Horatio Alger America as perceived in those pre-war years that in 1914 he turned down a private offer of $100 thousand for his Internal C ombustion Engine Fault Finder which he developed while serving as Professo r and Chief Instructor at the New York College of Engineering S cience and Auto- mobile Instruction. Instead, he gave all rights to the United States military for aviation application.

The banner year of 1919 found him a member in good standing with the American Ass ociation of Progressive Medicine, and the elected Vice-Presiden t of the Allied Medical Association of America and the National Ass ociation of Drugless Practitioners. This all seems a strange background for a \"charlata n\" and \"huckster,\" as he was to be labelled and pilloried by Fishbein' s AMA, in conjunction with the equally acquiescent, ever-spineless FDA in the decades that fol- lowed. Something insidious and unnoticed had happened duri ng the twenty- four years since Dinshah's first visit to America. The robber barons of the nineteenth century had discovered value in technolo gy and proceeded to exercise the same piratical control over intellectu al property as they pre- viously had over the traditional sources of materia l wealth. Lights dimmed all over the short-lived Age of Enlightenmen t as new acquisi- tional and inquisitional institutions became empowe red and entrenched. Social historian and author David Lindsay (Magnific ent Possibilities, Koodansha America, Fall 1996) notes that with the c hange of the century there was a change in the perception of the technic al man, the inventor. New social forces coalesced, mediating direct conta ct between people and technology. The control and credibility that had be en the scientist's were co-opted by agencies of industry working with agenc ies of government. Canadian political scientist Andrew Michrowski fixe s the date with even more precision: \"It was possible for Nikola Te sla, Alexander Graham Bell, and George Westinghouse to make their mark be cause in their time, before 1913, the retardant forces were not yet orga nized enough to total- ly counterweigh their innovations.\" Suffice it to note that 1912 was the year that youn g Morris Fishbein, MD [sic] (neither passing anatomy nor completing hi s residency), en- tered the employment of the already disreputable Am erican Medical Association, without ever practising medicine. In 1 913 he became Assistant Editor of the AMA's journal, JAMA. A prol ific writer of articles, editorials and, later, books crusading for the medi cal profession, Fishbein became Editor of JAMA and Hygeia in 1924, holding t hese two posts for 25 years. So it was against this background that Dinshah, ign orant of or indiffer- ent to this dawning of a New Age of Darkness, innoc ently went public with SCT in April 1920 in New York City. The first formal instruction, in"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"252 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries December that year, was attended by 27 students. Du ring the next four years (as Morris Fishbein consolidated his politica l power within the AMA) Dinshah held 26 classes, training over 800 stu dents, predominant- ly physicians but including many lay trainees as we ll. It was the very ease with which the correct tonatio n could be deter- mined and applied by laymen in the privacy of their homes (as much as, if not more than, mere efficacy) which constituted the true threat. If Dinshah had kept the SCT technology arcane, the equ ipment expensively overdesigned and within the preserve of the profess ional health commu- nity, events would have played out quite differentl y. Unquestionably it was this accessibility and the consequent commercia l threat which SCT represented that made Dinshah an early target for a n eager Fishbein. Fortunately for Dinshah, an early attendee was the twenty-three-year- tenured Chief Surgeon of the Woman's Hospital of Ph iladelphia, the high- ly credentialled Kate W. Baldwin, M.D., F.A.C.S., a member of the AMA and the Pennsylvania Medical Society, and the first woman in the American Academy of Ophthalmology and Ololaryngolog y. Until her death in 1937, she remained a private SCT practitio ner and a vociferous advocate in public, frequently defending SCT and Di nshah against the dark forces of repression. Dr. Baldwin enjoyed sufficient status and seniority that the initial anti- light-therapy onslaught could only incommode but no t intimate or destroy her. Indeed, so forceful was her presence and so un equivocal her defence testimony at Dinshah's first trial in 1931, that th e government refrained from any prosecution of Dinshah—on the basis of sci ence—during her lifetime. In 1921 Dr. Baldwin arranged for Dinshah to lecture in Philadelphia. Eventually her brother, the equally eminent surgeon L. Grant Baldwin, M.D., F.A.C.S. (Mayo Clinic), was to produce severa l SCT units to his Brooklyn, New York, practice. Some of the social (political) history of SCT is to be found reserved in the meagre, but reliable, regular Minutes of the Bo ard of Managers of the Woman's Hospital in Philadelphia. Over the next fiv e years these records were to suggest even more than they revealed. Dr. Baldwin's request to address the Board on her i n-patient SCT work was granted, and on 21 December 1923, according to the Minutes, she \"gave an illustrated account of the wonderful work done in the Hospital with the spectrochrome [sic]. She described a remar kable case of a child ... so badly burned that there seemed no hope of he r recovery. With the use of the Spectrochrome [sic] [primarily using the colour turquoise, i.e., blue plus green], the child is almost entirely cure d.

The JAMA article concluded: Some physicians, after reading this article, may wo nder why we have devoted the amount of space to a subject that, on i ts face, seems so preposterous as to condemn itself. When it is reali zed that helpless but incredulous patients are being treated for such ser ious conditions as syphilis, conjunctivitis, ovaritis, diabetes mellit us, pulmonary tuberculo- sis and chronic gonorrhea with colored lights, the space will not be deemed excessive. While it took four years for Fishbein finally to br ing Dinshah before his first magistrate, the first blood had been drawn mu ch earlier. Two months after the JAMA article appeared in print, the Woman 's Hospital Board of Managers' Minutes of 28 March 1924 report the recei pt of a letter from the staff, requesting that Dr. Baldwin discontinue the use of SCT. The only ground offered for this initiative was the JAMA art icle. The Board's time- tested response was the classic bureaucratic reflex : an ad hoc committee was established to evaluate the situation for later discussion. Not all the Board's problems conveniently faded dur ing this interval and it was forced to address the issue head on. Acc ording to the minutes of 23 May 1924: \".. . the question had been conside red from every view- point and . . . the Committee recommended the conti nuance of present con- ditions. This report of the Committee was accepted. \" [Author's emphasis added.] Almost a year later, the Minutes of 27 March 1925 r ecord that, \"Dr. Baldwin in a letter spoke of her need of more room for the Spectrochrome.

There is a subtle but interesting peculiarity to th is sudden, decisive turn- about spontaneously appearing in the Minutes withou t warning. True, the Minutes give no picture of day-to-day hospital poli tics, and given their narrow purpose and focus, especially as the sole hi storical source, they would of course tend to conceal more of a general c ontextual circum- stance than they could reveal. So we are left to speculate on the strangeness of t he impudence of a let- ter from the hospital interns, received by the Boar d and reported in the Minutes of 24 September 1926, expressing their obje ctions to Dr. Baldwin's presence on the surgical staff. Traditionally interns, from a socio-political persp ective, constitute the least vocal and effective participants in hospital policy formation. However, one can perhaps understand, even sympathis e with the interns' position, with their cumulative daily frustration a s endless streams of seri- ous surgical candidates and other diseased patients were regularly being sent home without ever seeing a knife or pill. What is less understandable is the effectiveness of their one letter. The September meeting moved to request Dr. Baldwin' s resignation from the surgical staff, but also moved that she \"b e granted the privilege of practising Spectro-chrome Therapy with her priva te patients in the Woman's Hospital.\" Both motions were carried. The B oard passed on the request to Dr. Baldwin, and by the meeting of 22 Oc tober 1926, without record of internal debate or explanation, the board accepted \"with regret\" Dr. Baldwin's resignation from the surgical staff. Just before Dinshah's first trial in 1931 in Buffalo, Erie County, New Yo rk state, Dr. Baldwin received a letter from the Secretary of the Erie Co unty Medical Society specifically soliciting her comments about the 1924 article and the impending criminal action. The letter read: According to [the JAMA] article, Susie T., age 9, w ho was admitted to the Woman's Hospital with a sloughed appendix and p eritonitis, devel- oped a pneumonia which was treated by Dr. Baldwin w ith lemon, turquoise and magenta colored lights. Susie went ho me well and happy. Dinshah P. Ghadiali, using the title M.D., is the p ublisher of Spectro- Chrome. He is under arrest in Buffalo charged with grand larceny for selling a course of lectures and leasing a colored light apparatus of alleged curative value for human ailments.

Our Society is somewhat interested in the outcome of this case and we will very much appreciate your tel ling us if your name was used with authority."},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Unorthodox Science 255 Dr. Baldwin's ringing endorsement was but faint ind ication of the eye- opening testimony she would soon deliver under oath . Her reply read: Your letter of June 9th is just received. The state ment printed in the Journal of the American Medical Association of Janu ary 26th, 1924 is practically as written by me for Spectro-Chrome mag azine. Susie's was an emergency operation at nine o'clock at night. Th ere was nothing left of the appendix to remove. There were quantities of pus. The wound could not be closed, free drainage was provided and the child put to bed with little hope that she would live until morning. For some days, an enema would simply pass through and out of the abdo minal opening. Susie did develop pneumonia. I did use Spectro-Chro me and eventual- ly she did leave the hospital in good condition. In the Woman's Hospital, I used Spectro-Chrome for many things to the satisfaction of the patients, the staff and the Board. The results were approved by all interested, until the article cited came out in the Journal. Then the staff turned traitor. The Board appointed a Special Committee of five to investigate, and a copy of its report I am enclosing. After this investigation I was granted a large space for the w ork of Spectro- Chrome. The American Medical Association continues to rate me as a Fellow in good standing. Not the slightest effort t o prove the truth has ever been made by the AMA or the doctors. The simpl e fact that the AMA made the statement against Spectro-Chrome was s ufficient to condemn. At the time I wrote to the Journal stating facts. The courtesy of a reply was not granted. The letter was sent by registered mail and a return card showed that it was delivered. Eventuall y this article was the cause of my losing my position on the surgical staf f of the Woman's Hospital. The AMA has not been just to one of its members or to humanity; within the year of 1929, communications have been s ent by the AMA to several of my patients in the shape of a reprint of the article published in the 1924 Journal and a letter ridiculing Spectro -Chrome and me. Spectro-Chrome has more value as a therapeutic meas ure than all the drugs and serums manufactured. I would close my office tonight, never to reopen, if I could not use Spectro-Chrome.

His first victory, at Buffalo, NY, in 1931, was the last time the anti -light forces dared expose themselves to a decision rendered by a jury allowed to hear med- ical evidence and expert scientific testimony. His second victory (the first Camden trial, 1934) rested on the judicial reasonin g that, being of Parsee descent, Dinshah was a \"white man\" and therefore, 1 7 years after his nat- uralisation, he was ruled to be not deportable."},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"256 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries Just as, in retrospect, the involvement of the norm ally non-influential intern role in efficaciously precipitating Baldwin' s predicament seems to be more than meets the eye, so too is the circumsta nce that led to Dinshah's arrest in May 1930. The indictment charge d that he \"did felo- niously steal $175 from one Houseman Hughes by fals ely representing and pretending that a certain instrument and machin e [Spectro-Chrome] would cure any and all human diseases and ailments. \" Again, the reliable Court record here gives scanty insight. Looking back at the actual ascertainable, there is reasonab le inference that Hughes was only a point man—but for whom? He was a layman who had admit- tedly never received, witnessed or administered a t onation treatment. Affidavits and testimony from official records show only that he leased a unit (subsequently defaulting on the payment) and p romptly pressed charges. There is no indication that he even remove d it from the box. Someone on the prosecution side did turn it on, alt hough did not take advantage of the exercise to attempt a tonation. The core of the embarrassingly underprepared prosec ution (what could they actually say?) was the \"expert\" testimony of a physicist who testified to the fact that the unit used an ordinary light, p rojected through ordinary coloured glass filters, producing no spectral alter ations nor new rays of any sort. This was rather extraordinary testimony, considering that Dinshah had never claimed otherwise! (This 1931 trial was also the last time the governm ent was to base any indictment on its \"ordinariness.\" Later, when the F DA, in a convenient about-face, proclaimed the Spectro-Chrome a \"medica l device\" (though unauthorised), it provided the cloak of legality un der which they conduct- ed, unopposed, hundreds of warrantless, confiscator y and non-compensa- tory raids through the living rooms, basements and converted garages of otherwise innocent, non-complaining citizens after 1947.) Dinshah, despite facing a looming 10-year/$10,000 a dverse judgement, chose to defend himself with a five-witness defence which included three M.D.s. He reasoned: \"The judge knows the law and I know my science so I can defend it better than any lawyer. Truth can b e defeated but never conquered.\" Unprepared for an impregnable defence, the state pr oduced in its rebut- tal its only medical witness: Albert Sy, M.D., a pr actitioner of the high- tech, expensive and generally inaccessible treatmen t modalities of radi- um, X-ray and ultraviolet radiation. This prosecuti on witness, also testi- fying to his zero experience with SCT, was forced t o admit under oath that he had no evidence at all for his \"expert\" opinion that there \"could be no therapeutic value of colored light or other appreci able effect on animals.\" Dinshah's first witness, Dr. Welcome Hanoi, an earl y SCT student and"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Unorthodox Science 257 enthusiastic proponent, had posted the $1,500 bail. His modest credential was his reputation as a local general practitioner of thirty years' experi- ence. He gave unresolved credit to SCT for his succ esses with cancers, diabetes, gonorrhea, syphilis, ulcers, neuritis, me ningitis, heart conditions and many other disorders. Dr. Martha Peebles had a distinguished twenty-four- year private prac- tice in New York where she had also held public off ice with the City Department of Health before serving with General Pe rshing's expedi- tionary forces (attending up to sixty-one operation s a day). Invalided by crippling arthritis and neuritis, her health was re stored one month after receiving her first tonation treatment from Dr. Bal dwin, and she subse- quently re-established her medical practice. In cou rt she recounted her success with cancers, hypotropic arthritis, poliomy elitis, mastoiditis, sci- atica, heart disorders, goitres, ulcers, neuritis a nd many other disorders. Dr. Kate Baldwin's testimony was extensive, forcefu lly unequivocal and unshakeable. The worst nightmare of a prosecuti ng cross-examiner, she repeated affirmatively as to SCT's efficacy in the treatment of cataracts, glaucoma, acute eye infections and hemor rhaging; mastoid and middle-ear problems; tonsillitis and adenoidal diso rders; tuberculosis, bronchitis and pleurisy; functional and organic hea rt disorders; ulcers, hemorrhoids, boils, drug addictions, asthma, laryng itis, mouth disorders, rheumatism, lumbago, syphilis, cancer, radiation bu rns, appendicitis, strangulated hernia and many other disorders. The trial lasted for four days before the jury retu rned a \"not guilty\" ver- dict in ninety minutes. Subsequently (in addition t o his previous loss in Portland in 1928), Dinshah was to lose actions in C leveland, Wilmington, Washington, D.C., Brooklyn (the decisive FDA ruling ) and, finally, in Camden in 1947. By 1941, mail sent to Dinshah's institute was being returned by the local postmaster, marked \"Fraudulent: Mail to this address returned by order of the Post-Master General.\" No doubt this pu rely postal adminis- tration, not the result of a judicial proceeding, c ontributed measurably to the recognition of the AMA as a para-governmental a gency of intimida- tion, and hastened the final discontinuance of SCT by the dwindling num- bers of loyal M.D. practitioners. Through an internal restructuring and reorganising at the Spectro- Chrome Institute, Dinshah was for a while able to c ircumvent and neu- tralise the mail blockade. Suffice it to note that Dinshah's manoeuvre was a short-lived expediency, lasting six years until 1 947. While looking back on Dinshah as an exemplar of ind efatigable, perse- vering resiliency and inner strength of character, in balance we must also note with all due respect the persistence, long mem ory and vindictive, sin-"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"258 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries gle-minded purposiveness of the private professiona l associations, in concert with government regulatory agencies, now legislativ ely armed to dispose of the inconvenience of the evidences and protocols of both court and clinic.

To para- phrase Cervantes very loosely, a tale of \"intellect ual inquisition\" without arson is like a meal without wine. The 1945 fire that destroyed Dinshah's main buildin g, just ninety days before the Brooklyn trial, caused inestimable damag e not just to his defence but to all of us through the destruction of demonstration proto- types and the irreplaceable case histories of twent y-five years. Losing the second Camden trial (the FDA-driven acti on on \"mislabel- ing\") in 1947, Dinshah was fined $20,000 and senten ced to a five-year probation period, a condition of which was to \"surr ender for destruction all printed material (save some personal notes) per taining to coloured light therapy—a singular collection valued then at $250,000. He was fur- ther ordered to disassociate himself from any resea rch in the field. Probation completed in 1953, Dinshah again restruct ured his institute, this time as an educational institution, Visible Sp ectrum Research Institute, and resumed the dissemination of information and eq uipment—but with the disclaimer asserting that \"in accordance with t he current conventional medical view, there is no curative, therapeutic val ue\" to these projection systems. Independent of any SCT/Dinshah data, this scientific \"edict\" was already known to be false. (In 1958 the FDA finally obtained the perma- nent injunctions, still in effect today, under whic h Dinshah was to operate until his death in 1996, at the age of ninety-two.) Contrary opinions such as those of the medical esta blishment-respect- ed A. J. Ochsner, M.D., F.A.C.S., author of still-c lassical surgical text- books, could again be made weightless by edict.

When he attempted to patent the devi ce, the government demanded that he prove it worked. When he did, the NSA (National Security Agency) confiscated the Neurophone. It too k [Flanagan] years of legal battle to get his invention back. When I was fifteen years old, I gave a lecture at t he Houston Amateur Radio Club, during which we demonstrated the Neurop hone to the audi- ence. The next day we were contacted by a reporter from the Houston Post newspaper. He said that he had a relative who was n erve-deaf from spinal meningitis and asked if we might try the Neurophone on his relative. The test was a success. The day after that, an article on the Neurophone as a potential hearing aid for the deaf appeared and wen t out on the interna- tional wire services. The publicity grew over the next two years. In 1961 , Life magazine came to our house and lived with us for over a week . They took thousands of photographs and followed me around from dawn to dusk. The article appeared in the 14 September 1962 issue. After that , I was invited to appear on the I've Got a Secret show hosted by Gary Moore. The show was telecast from the NBC studios in New York. Duri ng the show, I placed electrodes from the Neurophone on the lower back of Bess Meyerson while the panel tried to guess what I was doing to her. She was able to \"hear\" a poem that was being played through the Neurophone elec- trodes. The poem was recorded by Andy Griffith, ano ther guest on the show. Since the signal from the Neurophone was only perceived by Bess Meyerson, the panel could not guess what I was doin g to her. "},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"264 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries History of the Neurophone The first Neurophone was made when I was 14 years o ld, in 1958. A description was published in our first book , Pyramid Power. The device was constructed by attaching two Brillo pads to insulated copper wires. Brillo pads are copper w ire scouring pads used to clean pots and pans. They are about tw o inches in diameter. The Brillo pads were inserted into pla stic bags that acted as insulators to prevent electric shock when applied to the head. The wires from the Brillo pads were connected to a reversed audio output transformer that was attached to a hi- fi amplifier. The output voltage of the audio transformer was abo ut 1,500 volts peak-to-peak. When the insulated pads were pl aced on the temples next to the eyes and the amplifier was driven by speech or music, you could \"hear\" the resulting sou nd inside your head. The perceived sound quality was very poo r, highly distorted and very weak. I observed that during certain sound peaks in the a udio driving signal, the sound perceived in the head was very clear and very loud. When the signal was observed on an o scillo- scope while listening to the sound, the signal was perceived as being loudest and clearest when the amplifier wa s over- driven and square waves were generated. At the same time, the transformer would ring or oscillate with a damp ened wave form at frequencies of 40-50 kHz. The next Neurophone consisted of a variable frequen cy vacuum tube oscillator that was amplitude-modulated . This output signal was then fed into a high frequency tr ansformer that was flat in frequency response in the 20-100 k Hz range. The electrodes were placed on the head and the osci llator was tuned so that maximum resonance was obtained using the As a result of the Life magazine article and the ex posure on the Gary Moore Show, we received over a million letters abou t the Neurophone. The patent office started giving us problems. The e xaminer said that the device could not possibly work, and refused to issu e the patent for over twelve years. The patent was finally issued after m y patent lawyer and I took a working model of the Neurophone to the paten t office. This was an unusual move since inventors rarely bring their inv entions to the patent examiner. The examiner said that he would allow the patent to issue if we"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Unorthodox Science 265 human body as part of the tank circuit. Later model s had a feedback mechanism that automatically adjusted the frequency for resonance. We found that the dielectric constan t of human skin is highly variable. In order to achieve maximu m transfer of energy, the unit had to be retuned to resonance in order to match the \"dynamic dielectric response\" of the body of the listener. The 2,000 volt peak-to-peak amplitude-modulated car rier wave was then connected to the body by means of two -inch diameter electrode discs that were insulated by mea ns of mylar films of different thicknesses. The Neurophone is r eally a scalar wave device since the out-of-phase signals from the electrodes mix in the non-linear complexities of the skin diel ectric. The signals from each capacitor electrode are 180 degre es out of phase. Each signal is transmitted into the complex dielectric of the body where phase cancellation takes place. The net result is a scalar vector. Of course I did not know this w hen I first developed the Neurophone. This knowledge came much later when we learned that the human nervous system is es pecially sensitive to scalar signals. The high frequency amplitude-modulated Neurophone h ad excellent sound clarity. The perceived signal was v ery clearly perceived as if it were coming from within the head . We estab- lished quite early that some totally nerve-deaf peo ple could hear with the device. But for some reason, not all nerve-deaf people hear with it the first time. We were able to stimulate visual phenomena when the elec- trodes were placed over the occipital region of the brain. The possibilities of Neurophonic visual stimulation sug gest that we may someday be able to use the human brain as a VGA monitor!

To our relief, the employee was able to hear with it a nd, for the first time in the history of the patent office, the Neurophone fi le was reopened and the patent was allowed to issue.

The senior scientist on the project was my close friend and business par tner, Dr. Dwight Wayne Batteau, Professor of Physics and Mechanical Engineering at Harvard and Tufts. In the Dolphin Project we developed the basis for m any potential new technologies. We were able to ascertain the encodin g mechanism used by the human brain to decode speech intelligence patte rns, and were also able to decode the mechanism used by the brain to locate sound sources in three dimensional space.. . . These discoveries led to the development of a 3-D holographic sound system that could place sou nds in any location in space as perceived by the listener. We also developed a man-dolphin language translator . The translator was able to decode human speech so that complex dol phin whistles were generated. When dolphins whistled, the loudspeaker on the translator would output human speech sounds. We developed a jo int language between ourselves and our two dolphins. The dolphin s were located in the lagoon of a small island off of Oahu, Hawaii. We ha d offices at Sea Life Park and Boston. We commuted from Boston to Hawaii to test out our various electronic gadgets. We recorded dolphins and whales in the open sea and were able to accurately identify the locations of various marine mammals by 3-D sound-localization algorithms similar to those used by the brain to local- ize sound in space. The brain is able to detect phase differences of tw o microseconds. We were able to confirm this at Tufts University. The pinnae or outer ear is a \"phase-encoding\" array that generates a time-ratio code that is used by the brain to localise the source of sounds in 3-D space . The localization time ratios are run from two microseconds to several mil liseconds. A person with one ear can localize sound sources (non-linear ) to a 5 degree angle of accuracy anywhere in space. You can test this by closing your eyes"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Unorthodox Science 267 while having a friend jingle keys in space around y our head. With you eyes closed you can follow the keys and point to th em very accurately. Try to visualize where the keys are in relation to your head. With a little prac- tice, you can accurately point directly at the keys with your eyes closed. If you try to localize a sine wave, the experiment will not work. The sig- nal must be non-linear in character. You can locali ze the sine wave if the speaker has a nonlinear or distortion in the output wave form. A sine wave cannot be localized because phase differences in a sine wave are very hard to detect. The brain will focus on the distortion a nd use it to measure time ratios. Clicks or pulses are very easy to localize. If you distort your pinnae by bending the outer ear s out of shape, your ability to localize the sound source is destroyed. The so-called cocktail party effect is the ability to localize voices in a noisy party. This is due to the brain's ability to detect phase differences and then pay attention to localized areas in 3-D space. A favorite \"intellige nce\" trick is to have sen- sitive conversations in \"hard rooms\" with wooden wa lls and floors. A microphone \"bug\" will pick up all the echoes and th is will scramble the voice. Almost all embassies contain \"hard rooms\" fo r sensitive conversa- tions. If you put a microphone in the room with a d uplicate of the human pinnae on top of it, you will be able to localize t he speakers and tune out the echoes—just like you were at a party. In order to localize whales and dolphins under wate r, we used metal ears 18 inches in diameter that were attached to hy drophores. When these ears were placed under water, we were able to accur ately localize under- water sounds in 3-D space by listening to the sound s by earphones. We used this system to localize whales and dolphins. S ound travels five times faster under water, so we made the \"pinnae\" larger to give the same time- ratio encoding as we find in the air. We also made large plastic ears that were tested in Vietnam. These ears were of the same proportions as real ears but were much larger. They enabled us to hear distant sounds with a high degree of localization accuracy in the jungle. It seems that we can adapt to ears of almost any size. The reason we can do this is because sound recognition is based on a time-ratio code. We were able to reverse the process and could take any sound record- ing and encode it so that sounds were perceived as coming from specific points in space. Using this technique, we could spr ead out a recording of an orchestra. The effect added reality as if you we re actually listening to a live concert. This information has never been use d commercially except in one instance when I allowed The Beach Boys to re cord one of their albums with my special \"laser\" microphones. We developed a special Neurophone that enabled us t o \"hear\" dolphin sounds up to 250 thousand Hertz. By using the Neuro phone as part of the"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"268 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries man-dolphin communicator, we were able to perceive more of the intrica- cies of the dolphin language. The human ear is limi ted to a 16 kHz range, while dolphins generate and hear sounds out to 250 kHz. Our special Neurophone enabled us to hear the full range of dol phin sounds. As a result of the discovery of the encoding system used by the brain to localize sound in space and also to recognize sp eech intelligence, we were able to create a digital Neurophone. When our digital Neurophone patent application was sent to the patent office, the Defense Intelligence Agency slapped it under a secrecy order. I was unable to work on the device or talk about it to anyone for another five years. This was terribly discouraging. The first patent to ok twelve years to get, and the second patent application was put under sec recy for five years. The digital Neurophone converts sound waves into a digital signal that matches the time encoding that is used by the brain . These time signals are used not only in speech recognition but also in spa tial recognition for the 3-D sound localization. The digital Neurophone is the version that we event ually produced and sold as the Mark XI and the Thinkman Model 50 versi ons. These Neuro- phones were especially useful as subliminal learnin g machines. If we play educational tapes through the Neurophone, the data is very rapidly incor- porated into the long-term memory banks of the brai n. HOW DOES IT WORK? The skin is our largest and most complex organ. In addition to being the first line of defence against infection, the skin i s a gigantic liquid crystal brain. The skin is piezoelectric. When it is vibrated or r ubbed, it generates electric signals and scalar waves. Every organ of p erception evolved from the skin. When we are embryos, our sensory organs e volved from folds in the skin. Many primitive organisms and animals can see and hear with their skin. When the Neurophone was originally developed, neuro physiologists considered that the brain was hard-wired and that t he various cranial nerves were hard-wired to every sensory system. The eighth cranial nerve is the nerve bundle that runs from the inner ear to the brain. Theoretically, we should only be able to hear with our ears if our sensor organs are hard-wired. Now the concept of a holographic brain has come into being. The holographic brain theory states that the brain uses a holographic encoding system so that the entire brain may be abl e to function as a mul- tiple-faceted sensory encoding computer. This means that sensory impres- sions may be encoded so that any part of the brain can recognize input sig-"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Unorthodox Science 269 nals according to a special encoding. Theoretically , we should be able to see and hear through multiple channels. The key to the Neurophone is the stimulation of the nerves of the skin with a digitally encoded signal that carries the sa me time-ratio encoding that is recognised as sound by any nerve in the bod y. All commercial digital speech recognition circuitry is based on so-called dominant frequency power analysis. While speech can be recognised by such a circuit, the truth is that speech encoding i s based on time ratios. If the frequency power analysis circuits are not phased pr operly, they will not work. The intelligence is carried by phase informat ion. The frequency con- tent of the voice gives our voice a certain quality , but frequency does not contain information. All attempts at computer voice recognition and voice generation are only partially successful. Until dig ital time-ratio encoding is used, our computers will never be able to really ta lk to us. The computer that we developed to recognize speech for the man-dol- phin communicator used time-ratio analysis only. By recognising and using time-ratio encoding, we could transmit clear voice data through extremely narrow bandwidths. In one device, we deve loped a radio trans- mitter that had a bandwidth of only 300 Hz while ma intaining crystal clear transmission. Since signal-to-noise ratio is based on band width consider- ations, we were able to transmit clear voice over t housands of miles while using milliwatt power. Improved signal-processing algorithms are the basis of a new series of Neurophones that are currently under development . These new Neurophones use state-of-the-art digital processing to render sound infor- mation much more accurately. ELECTRONIC TELEPATHY? The Neurophone is really an electronic telepathy ma chine. Several tests prove that it bypasses the eighth cranial nerve or hearing nerve and trans- mits sound directly to the brain. This means that t he Neurophone stimu- lates perception through a seventh or alternate sen se. All hearing aids stimulate tiny bones in the middle ear. Sometimes when the eardrum is damaged, the bones of the inner ear are stimulated by a vibrator that is placed behind the ear on the bas e of the skull. Bone con- duction will even work through the teeth. In order for bone conduction to work, the cochlea or inner ear that connects to the eighth cranial nerve must function. People who are nerve-deaf cannot hea r through bone con- duction because the nerves in the inner ear are not functional. A number of nerve-deaf people and people who have h ad the entire inner ear removed by surgery have been able to hear with the Neurophone. If the Neurophone electrodes are placed on the clos ed eyes or on the"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"270 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries face, the sound can be clearly \"heard\" as if it wer e coming from inside the brain. When the electrodes are placed on the face, the sound is perceived through the trigeminal nerve. We therefore know that the Neurophone can work thro ugh the trigem- inal or facial nerve. When the facial nerve is dead ened by means of anaes- thetic injections, we can no longer hear through th e face. In these cases, there is a fine line where the skin on the face is numb. If the electrodes are placed on the numb skin, we c annot hear it but when the electrodes are moved a fraction of an inch over to skin that still has feeling, sound perception is restored. This proves that the means of sound perception via the Neurophone is by means of skin and not by means of bone conductio n. There was an earlier test performed at Tufts Univer sity that was de- signed by Dr. Dwight Wayne Batteau, one of my partn ers in the U.S. Navy Dolphin Communications Project. This test was known as the \"Beat Frequency Test.\" It is well known that sound waves of two slightly dif- ferent frequencies create a \"beat\" note as the wave s interfere with each other. For example, if a sound of 300 Hz and one of 330 Hz are played into one ear at the same time, a beat note of 30 Hz will be perceived. This is a mechanical summation of sound in the bone stru cture of the inner ear. There is another beat phenomenon known as the binau ral beat. In the bin- aural beat, sounds beat together in the corpus call osum in the center of the brain. This binaural beat is used by Robert Monroe of the Monroe Institute to stimulate altered states. That is, to entrain th e brain into high alpha or theta states. The Neurophone is a powerful brain-entrainment devi ce. If we play alpha or theta signals directly through the Neuroph one, we can entrain any brain state we like. In a future article we will te ll how the Neurophone has been used as a subliminal learning device and also as a behavior modifi- cation system. Batteau's theory was that if we could place the Neu rophone electrodes so that the sound was perceived as coming from one side of the head only, and if we played a 300 Hz signal through the Neurop hone, if we also played a 330 Hz signal through an ordinary headphon e we would get a beat note if the signals were summing in the inner ear bones. When the test was conducted, we were able to percei ve two distinct tones without a beat. This test again proved that N europhonic hearing was not through the means of bone conduction. When we used a stereo Neurophone, we were able to g et a beat note that is similar to the binaural beat, but the beat is occurring inside the nervous system and is not a result of bone conducti on. The Neurophone is a \"gateway\" into altered brain st ates. Its most pow-"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Unorthodox Science 271 erful use may be in direct communications with the brain centers, thereby bypassing the \"filters\" or inner mechanisms that ma y limit our ability to communicate to the brain. If we can unlock the secret of direct audio communi cations to the brain, we can unlock the secret of visual communications. The skin has recep- tors that can detect vibration, light, temperature, pressure and friction. All we have to do is stimulate the skin with the right signals. We are continuing Neurophonic research. We have rec ently developed other modes of Neurophonic transmission. We have al so reversed the Neurophone and found that we can detect scalar wave s that are generated by the living system. The detection technique is ac tually very similar to the process used by Dr. Hiroshi Motoyama in Japan. Dr. Motoyama used capacitor electrodes very much like those we use wi th the Neurophone to detect energies from the various chakras."},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"272 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries An example of the secrecy order that enables a gove rnment to confiscate a patent."},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"Section III The Suppression of UFO Technologies and Extraterrestrial Contact The UFO question carries with it the baggage of cen turies of speculation as to the very nature of who we are and how we got here.

Despi te the supposed exis- tence of an alien culture making its presence known and felt, our domi- nant terrestrial institutions would make it appear as though we are alone in an otherwise lifeless universe. It would not be presumptuous to assume that there has in fact been some sort of bargain or treaty negotiated between the alien visitors and the major Earth powe rs to perpetuate this appearance. Such a pact might allow the present pow er hierarchies to con- tinue to operate (with some new limitations and gui delines, of course) while at the same time essentially doing the work t hey've been assigned. It seems incredible that the fate of all beings of earth may already have been decided without our knowledge or consent, due to the censorship and top secret classification of sensitive information. Stanton Friedman, UFO researcher and nuclear physic ist, has publicly stated that \"whoever controls alien technology rule s the world.\" While there is abundant evidence that the U.S. government has had access to some alien technology for several decades, there is no doubt that the ones who really control alien technology are the aliens themselves. Regardless of this, much time and effort has gone into the res earch and development of these same innovations right here on earth. T. T ownsend Brown was succeeding with his antigravity work in the 1940s a nd 1950s and, in fact, experimentation of this sort has been ongoing for a t least seventy years. Indeed, there are many serious researchers who now believe that the U.S. moon landing program was accomplished with the aid of antigravity machines, and there is more than a little reason to believe them. (The lack of a blast-off exhaust from the lunar lander on Apo llo 11, for example, is one intriguing bit of evidence for this assertion.) Yet it is only recently that the news of a successful antigravity breakthrough i s being allowed to be published in mainstream physics journals. UFO research is big news these days, and the news i s coming fast and thick. I have chosen some of the most revealing sto ries I have been able to find to illustrate the extent of the cover-up of information concerning UFOs and the principles on which they operate.

Measuring about 30 cm across, it is said to reduce signif- icantly the weight of anything suspended over it. The claim—which has been rigorously examined by sci entists and is due to appear this month in a physics journal—could spa rk a technological rev- olution. By combating gravity—the most ubiquitous f orce in the universe— everything from transport to power generation, coul d be transformed. NASA, the United States space agency, is taking the claims seriously and is financing research into how the antigravity effect could be turned into a means of flight. The researchers at the Tampere University of Techno logy in Finland, who discovered the effect, say it could form the he art of a new power source in which it is used to drive fluids past ele ctricity-generating tur- bines. Other uses seem limited only by the imagination: • Lifts in buildings could be replaced by devices bui lt into the ground. People wanting to go up would simply activate the a ntigravity device— making themselves weightless—and with a gentle push ascend to the floor they want. • Space travel would become routine, as all the expen se and danger of rock- et technology is geared towards combating the Earth 's gravitational pull. • By using the devices to raise fluids against gravit y and then conven- tional gravity to pull them back to Earth against e lectricity-generated turbines, the devices could also revolutionize powe r generation.

The team found that even the air pressure above the device dropped slightly, with the effect detectable directly above the device on every floor above the laboratory. What makes this claim different from previous \"anti gravity\" devices scorned by the establishment is that it has survive d intense scrutiny by skeptical, independent experts and has been accepte d for publication by the Journal of Physics-D: Applied Physics, publishe d by Britain's Institute of Physics. Even so, most scientists will not feel comfortable with the idea of anti- gravity until other teams repeat the experiments. The Finnish team is already expanding its programme to see if it can amplify the antigravity effect.

Townsend Brown was jubilant when he returned fro m France in 1956. The soft-spoken scientist had a solid clue which co uld lead to fuelless space travel. His saucer-shaped discs flew at speed s of up to several hun- dred miles per hour, with no moving parts. One thin g he was certain of— the phenomena should be investigated by the best sc ientific institutions. Surely now the science establishment would admit th at he really had some- thing. Although the tall, lean physicist—handsome, in a gangly way—was a humble man, even shy, he confidently took his goo d news to a top-rank- ing officer he knew in Washington, D.C. \"The experiments in Paris proved that the anomalous motion of my disc airfoils was not all caused by ion wind.\" The listener would hear Brown's every word, because he took his time in get ting words out. \"They conclusively proved that the apparatus works even i n high vacuum. Here's the documentation ...\" Anomalous means unusual—a discovery which does not fit into the current box of acknowledged science. In this case, the anomaly revealed a connection between electricity and gravity. That year Interavia magazine reported that Brown's discs reached speeds of several hundred miles per hour when charg ed with several hun- dred thousand volts of electricity. A wire running along the leading edge of each disc charged that side with high positive v oltage, and the trailing edge was wired for an opposite charge. The high vol tage ionized air around them, and a cloud of positive ions formed ah ead of the craft and a cloud of negative ions behind. The apparatus was pu lled along by its self- generated gravity field, like a surfer riding a wav e. Fate magazine writer Gaston Burridge in 1958 also described Brown's meta l discs, some up to 30 inches in diameter by that time. Because they ne eded a wire to supply electric charges, the discs were tethered by a wire to a Maypole-like mast.

Drop it.\" Was this advice given to Brown by a highly-placed f riend who knew that the United States military was already explori ng electrogravitics? (Recent sleuthing by American scientist, Dr. Paul L a Violette, uncovers a paper trail which leads from Brown's early work, to ward secret research by the military and eventually points to \"Black Pro ject\" air craft.) HARASSMENT Were the repeated break-ins into Brown's laboratory meant to discourage him from pursuing his line of research? Brown didn't quit, although by that time he and his family had spent nearly $250,000 of their own money on research. He had already put in more than thirty years seeking scientific explanati ons for the strange phe- nomena he witnessed in the laboratory. He earlier c alled it electrogravitics, but later in his life, trying to get acknowledgemen t from establishment sci- entists, he stopped using the word \"electrogravitic s\" and instead used the more acceptable scientific terminology \"stress in d ielectrics.\" No matter what his day job, the obsessed researcher experimented in his home laboratory in his spare time. Above all he wanted to know \"Why is this happening?\" He was convinced that the coupl ing of the two forces —electricity and gravity—could be put to practical use. An arrogant academia ignored his findings. Given th e cold-shoulder treatment by the science establishment, Brown spent family savings and even personal food money on laboratory supplies. Pe rhaps he would not have had the heart to continue his lonely research if he had known in 1956 that nearly thirty more years of hard work were ahe ad of him. He died in 1985 with the frustration of having his findings st ill unaccepted. The last half of his career involved new twists. In stead of electro- gravitics, at the end of his life he was demonstrat ing \"gravitoelectrics\" and \"petrovoltaics\"—electricity from rocks. Brown's many patents and findings ranged from an electrostatic motor to unus ual high-fidelity speak- ers and electrostatic cooling, to lighter-than-air materials and advanced dielectrics. His name should be recognized by stude nts of science, but instead it has dropped into obscurity.

The usual child-like \"Why ?\" questions came from young Townsend with extraordinary intensity. F or example, his question \"Why do the (high voltage) electric wires sing?\" led him later in life to an invention. His discovery of electrogravitics, on the other han d, came through an intuition. As a sixteen-year-old, Townsend Brown ha d a hunch that the then-famous Coolidge X-ray tube might give a clue t o spaceflight tech- nology. His tests, to find a force in the rays them selves which would move mass, lead to a dead end. But in the meantime the o bservant experimenter noticed that high voltages applied to the tube itse lf caused a very slight motion. Excited, he worked on increasing the effect. Before he graduated from high school, he had an instrument he called a gravi tator. \"Wow,\" the teenager may have thought. \"Antigravity may be poss ible!\" World-chang- ing technological discoveries start with someone no ticing a small effect and then amplifying it. Unsure of what to do next, the next year he started college at California Institute of Technology. Even then his sensitivity was evident, because he saw the wisdom of going forward cautiously—first ga ining respect from his professors instead of prematurely bragging abou t his discovery of a new electrical principle. He was respected as a pro mising student and an excellent laboratory worker, but when he did tell h is teachers about his discovery they were not interested. He left school and joined the Navy. Next he tried Kenyon College in Ohio. Again, no sci entist would take his discovery seriously. It went against what the p rofessors had been taught; therefore it could not be. He finally found help at Dennison University in Gam bier, Ohio. Townsend met Professor of physics and astronomy Pau l Alfred Biefeld, Ph.D., who was from Zurich, Switzerland and had bee n a classmate of Albert Einstein. Biefeld encouraged Brown to experi ment further, and together they developed the principle which is know n in the unorthodox scientific literature as the Biefeld-Brown Effect. It concerned the same notion which the teenager had seen on his Coolidge tube—a highly charged electrical condenser moves toward its posit ive pole and away from its negative pole. Brown's gravitator measured weight losses of up to one percent. (In 1974 researcher Oliver Nichelso n pointed out to Brown that before 1918, Professor Francis E. Nipher of St . Louis discovered gravitational propulsion by electrically charging l ead balls, so the Brown- Blefeld Effect could more properly be called the Ni pher Effect. However,"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"280 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries Brown deserves credit for his sixty years of experi mentation and devel- oping further aspects of the principle.) Brown's 1929 article for the publication Science an d Inventions was titled bluntly, \"How I Control Gravity.\" The scienc e establishment still turned its back. By then he had graduated from the university, married, and was working under Professor Biefeld at Swazey O bservatory. His career in the early 1930s also included a post at the Naval Research Lab in Washington, D.C.; staff physicist for the Na vy's International Gravity Expedition to the West Indies; physicist fo r the Johnson- Smithsonian Deep Sea Expedition; and soil engineer for a federal agency and administrator with the Federal Communications C ommission. As his country's war effort escalated, he became a Lieutenant in the Navy Reserve and moved to Maryland as a materials e ngineer for the Martin aircraft company. Brown was then called into the Navy Bureau of Ships. He worked on how to degauss (erase magnetism from) ships to pro- tect them from magnetic-fuse mines, and his magneti c minefield detector saved many sailors' lives. PHILADELPHIA EXPERIMENT The \"Philadelphia Experiment\" which Brown may or ma y not have joined in 1940 is dramatized in a popular movie as a milit ary experiment in which United States Navy scientists are trying to d emagnetize a ship so that it will be invisible to radar. According to th e account, the ship and its crew dematerialized and rematerialized—became i nvisible and later returned from another dimension. Whatever the Project Invisibility experiment actual ly was, Brown was probably an insider, as the Navy's officer in charg e of magnetic and acoustic mine-sweeping research and development. However, la ter in life, Brown was said to be mute on the topic of the alleged Phi ladelphia Experiment, except for brief disclaimers. He told friend Josh R eynolds of California, who made arrangements for Brown's experiments in th e early 1980s, that the movie and the controversial book The Philadelph ia Experiment, by William L. Moore and Charles Berlitz, were greatly inflated. He appar- ently did not elaborate on that comment. Reynolds spoke on a panel discussion at a public co nference (dedicated to Townsend Brown) in Philadelphia in 1994, along w ith highly-creden- tialed physicist Elizabeth Rauscher, Ph.D. Rauscher theorized that the Philadelphia Experiment legend grew out of the fact that certain magnetic fields can in effect \"degauss the brain\"—cause temp orary memory loss.

The next year he collapsed from nervous exhaustion and retir ed from the Navy on doctors' recommendations. More than his hard work c aused his health to break down, he had suffered years of deeply-felt di sappointments because his life's work—the gravitator—had not been recogni zed by scientific institutions which could have investigated it. The final precipitating fac- tor for his collapse was an incident involving one of his men. BREAK-IN AT PEARL HARBOR After he recuperated for six months, his next job w as as a radar consult- ant with Lockheed-Vega. He later left the Californi a aircraft corporation, moved to Hawaii and was a consultant at the Navy ya rd at Pearl Harbor. An old friend who was teaching calculus there had o pened some doors, and in 1945 Brown demonstrated his latest flying te thered discs to a top military officer—Admiral Arthur W. Radford, command er-in-chief for the U.S. Pacific Fleet, who later became Joint Chief of Staff for President Dwight Eisenhower. Brown was treated with respect because of who he wa s, but again no one signed up to help investigate his discovery. Hi s colleagues in the Navy treated it lightly because it was anomalous. When he returned to his room after the Pearl Harbor demonstration, how- ever, the room had been broken into and his noteboo ks were gone. A day or so later, as Josh Reynolds remembers Brown's accoun t of the incident, \"they came to him and said 'we have your work; you'll get it back.' A couple of days later they gave him back his books and said 'w e're not interested.'\" \"Why?\" Brown was given the answer that the effect w as a result of ion propulsion, or electric wind, and therefore could n ot be used in a vacuum such as outer space. The earth's atmosphere can be rich in ions (electri- cally-charged particles), but a vacuum is not. He was disgruntled, but not stopped. Later a study funded by a French government agency would prove the effect was not ca used by \"electric wind.\" But even before that, Brown knew that it wou ld take an electric hurricane to create the lifting force he saw in his experiments. Project Winterhaven was his own effort for furtheri ng electrogravitic research. He began the project in 1952 in Cleveland , Ohio. Although he demonstrated two-feet-diameter disk-shaped transduc ers which reached a speed of 17 feet per second when electrically energ ized, he was again met with lack of interest. Alone in his enthusiasm, he watched the craft fly in a 20 foot diameter circle around a pole. According to the known laws of science, this should not be happening. And he went on to make spectacu- lar demonstrations. When La Societe Nationale de Construction Aeronauti que Sud Quest"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"282 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries (SNCASO) in France offered him funding, he went to France and built better devices as well as had them properly tested. Those tests convinced his backers that it could mean a feasible drive sys tem for outer space, he told Reynolds. SNCASO merged with Sud Est in 1956 a nd funding was cut, so Brown had to return to the United States. Brown was eager to show the French documentation to all those offi- cials who had raised the wall of indifference in th e past. But after his dis- couraging visit to Washington, D.C. in 1956 and wha t felt like a put-down from Admiral Rickover, he apparently decided \"if th e military isn't inter- ested, the aerospace companies might be.\" Friends s ay it did not occur to him to ask if the defense industry was already work ing on electrogravitics, unknown to him. In 1953 he had flown saucer-shaped devices of three feet in diameter in a demonstration for some Air Force o fficials and men from major aerospace companies. Energized with high volt age, they whizzed around the 50 foot diameter course so fast that the reports of the test were stamped \"classified.\" Independent researcher Paul LaViolette, Ph.D., trac es the path which these impressive results led to—toward the Pentagon , the military hub of the United States. \"A recently declassified Air For ce intelligence report indicates that by September of 1954 the Pentagon ha d launched a program to develop a manned antigravity craft of the sort s uggested in Project Winter- haven,\" writes LaViolette. Meanwhile, Brown went practically door-to-door in L os Angeles to try to rouse some interest in his work. One day he retu rned to his laboratory to find it had been broken into and much of his bel ongings were missing. CHARACTER ASSASSINATION Then the nasty rumours started. The type of rumours which can discredit a man's character, upset his wife and children, and overall cause deep dis- tress to a sensitive man. Another tragedy in Brown's life was the sudden deat h of his friend and helpful supporter, Agnew Bahnson, who funded him to do anti-gravity research and development beginning in 1957 in North Carolina. Did they make too much progress? In 1964 Bahnson, an experie nced pilot, myste- riously flew into electric wires and crashed. Bahns on's heirs dissolved the project. The authors of the book The Philadelphia Experiment wrote that in spite of his numerous patents and demonstrations gi ven to governmental and corporate groups, success eluded Townsend Brown . \"Such interest as he was able to generate seemed to melt away almost as last as it devel- oped—almost as if someone . . . was working against him.\" Today's researchers looking at Townsend Brown's lif e have noticed"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"The Suppression of UFO Technologies and Extraterres trial Contact 283 that he went into semi-retirement some time in the 1960s. Tom Valone of Washington, D.C., who in 1994 compiled a book on Br own's work, spec- ulates that the work was classified and Brown was b ought off or somehow persuaded to stop promoting electrogravitics. Valon e told the April, 1994, meeting in Philadelphia that Dr. LaViolette's detec tive work sheds new light on what happened to Brown in the 1950s. The s peculation of these scientists is that \"this project was taken over by the military, worked on for 40 years, and we now have a craft that's flying around.\" Valone spec- ulates that Brown was de-briefed and told what he c ould talk about. In the later 1960s to 1985, Brown turned his attent ion to other research, although related. He mainly did basic research to t ry to understand strange effects he saw. As did T. H. Moray, Townsend Brown had decided that waves coming from outer space are not only detected on Earth, but also the waves build up a charge in a properly built dev ice. Instead of making increasingly-complex devices, however, Brown toward the end of his life in the 1980s was getting a charge—voltage to be exa ct—out of rocks and sand. It was all in search for answers. If his work had been accepted instead of suppressed by seeming disin- terest, he would be known to science students. His work would fill more than one science book; an encyclopedia set could ea sily be filled with T. T. Brown's experiments and discoveries. For example, his childhood fascination with the sin ging wires led him to investigate how to modulate ionized air like tha t which had carried the high-voltage current. Could this be used for high-f idelity sound systems? Eventually he did invent rich-sounding Ion Plasma S peakers which inci- dently had a built-in \"fac\"—a cool breeze of health -enhancing negative ions. Would this discovery have been commercialized if his main interest, electrogravitics, had not been suppressed by ignora nce or been co-opted? He searched for better dielectrics, endlessly tryin g new combinations. (A dielectric is any material which opposes the flo w of electric current while at the same time can store electrical energy. ) This search led him to study, when working with Bahnson, the lighter-than- air fine sand, in cer- tain dry river beds, which could be used to make ad vanced materials. The anomalous sands were first discovered by his hero C harles Brush early in the century. Brush also found that certain material s fell slower in a vacu- um chamber than others. He called it gravitational retardation and said they were slightly more interactive with gravity. These materials also sponta- neously demonstrated heat. Brush believed that the \"etheric gravitational wave\" interacted with some materials more richly th an with others. Brush's findings were swept under the rug of the science es tablishment. Brown followed his idol's lead and did basic resear ch in a number of areas. Gravito-electrics - how neutrinos or gravito ns or whatever-they-are"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"284 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries converted into electricity. This led him to conduct experiments in various locations, from the ocean to the bottom of the Berk eley mine shaft. When entrepreneur Josh Reynolds became interested i n Brown's work in the last five years of the inventor's life, Brow n was able to do the work he loved the most—petrovoltaics. No one else was pu tting electrodes on rocks to measure the minute voltages of electricity which the rocks some- how soaked up from the cosmos. Brown and Reynolds m ade artificial rocks to see what various materials could do and ho w long they would put out a charge. Their efforts in a number of areas led toward what they called a ForeverReady Battery—a penny-sized piece of rock wh ich put out a tiny amount of voltage indefinitely because they had lea rned how to \"soup-up\" the effect. After Brown died, Reynolds carried on t he research until fund- ing ran out. He estimates that it would have taken up to $10 million of advanced molecular engineering research to take the discovery to another stage of development. The high-power version of the battery remains on paper—only theory until developed farther. This discovery alone should have put Brown into sci ence history books. In all his years of experiments with the per iodic variations in the strip-chart recordings of the output from the mater ials, he found that the patterns had a relationship to position of the star s. And orientation toward the centre of the universe seemed to make a differe nce too. This resulted in further unconventional thinking that only made B rown more of an out- cast in the world of sanctioned science. While he was coming up with the cosmic findings, th e military research- ers had a different agenda. One of the reports dug up by researcher LaViolette came from a London think tank called Avi ation Studies International Ltd. In 1956 the think tank wrote a c lassified \"confidential\" survey of work done in electrogravitics. LaViolette says the only original copy of the document, called Report 13, was found i n the stacks at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base technical library i n Dayton, Ohio. It is not listed in the library's computer. Excerpts from Report 13 paint a picture of heavy se crecy. A 1954 seg- ment says that infant science of electro-gravitatio n may be a field where not only the methods are secret, but also the ideas themselves are a secret. \"Nothing therefore can be discussed freely at the m oment.\" A further report predicted bluntly that electrogravitics, lik e other advanced sci- ences, would be developed as a weapon. A couple of months later, another now declassified Aviation Report said it looked like the Pentagon was ready to sponsor el ectrogravitic propulsion devices and that the first disc should be finished by 1960. The report antic- ipated that it would take the decade of the 60s to develop it properly \"even"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"The Suppression of UFO Technologies and Extraterres trial Contact 285 though some combat things might be available ten ye ars from now.\" Defense contractors began to line up, as well as un iversities who get grants from the U.S. Department of Defense. After he came across Report 13, LaViolette put his knowledge of physics to work and began to piece together a pictu re of what may have happened in the past thirty years. It includes \"bla ck\" projects—work which the military decides should be so secretive t hat even Congress does not get reports about its funding. A breakthrough in LaViolette's quest for the pieces of the picture came when a few establishment scientists gave out tidbit s of formerly-secret information about a \"black funding\" project—the Ste alth B-2 bomber. (The B-2A is described as the world's most expensiv e aircraft at $1.2 bil- lion.) Their description of the B-2 gave LaViolette and others a number of clues about the bomber—softening of the sonic boom as Brown had talked about in the 1950s, a dielectric flying wing , a charged leading-edge, ions dumped into the exhaust stream and other clues . The B-2 seems to be a culmination of many of Brown's observations made more than forty years ago. Townsend Brown fought an uphill battle all his adul t life, at great cost to himself and to family life. His cause included g etting the science of advanced propulsion out into public domain, not hid den behind the Secrecy Act and a wall of classified documents. He died feeling that he had lost the battle."},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"Did NASA Sabotage Its Own Space Capsule? From NASA Mooned America! by Rene THE RIGHT STUFF The Seven Samurai is a 1954 Japanese cult movie abo ut a poverty strick- en village that hired seven magnificent warriors to help them fight the bandits. In 1960 Hollywood filmed The Magnificent S even which was effectively the same story set in Mexico as a weste rn. Someone in the hierarchy of NASA had undoubtedly seen one or both movies and decid- ed that seven space samurai was a psychologically a ppropriate number to start with. We were told that these men represented the nation's finest and that they possessed what was later called that elus ive quality: the \"Right Stuff.\" Virgil Grissom certainly had the \"Right Stuff.\" He was one of the orig- inal seven, culled from the first batch of military test pilots almost a decade before. Grissom was not the type of man who \"went along to get along.\" Men who spend their lives seeking the wild hairs on a new air- plane's ass seldom are. He was a professional test pilot, a mechanical engineer and had flown 100 combat missions in Korea . But he was dead before his flight to the Moon could fulfill his dre am. ACCIDENTS Compared to civilian test pilots the astronauts wer e underpaid. However, their perks were impressive. Their celebrity status instantly conferred upon them all the bonuses usually associated with show b usiness stardom. Each night on the town provided them with all the young women they could handle, plus free drinks in every bar in the countr y. They were also given a government jet trainer as a personal toy. Test pilots have a hazardous occupation which proba bly sees as many fatalities per unit of time as do men in combat. Ho wever, before the first Apollo manned flight ever cleared the launching pad eleven astronauts"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"The Suppression of UFO Technologies and Extraterres trial Contact 287 died in accidents. Grissom, Chaffee, and White were cremated in an Apollo capsule test on the launching pad during a c ompletely and suspi- ciously unnecessary test. Seven died in six air cra shes: Freemen, Basset and See, Rogers, Williams, Adams and Lawrence. Give ns was killed in a car crash. When you reflect on their deaths in the light of th e three-man-instant crematorium one wonders. Add the fact that there we re eight deaths in 1967 alone. One wonders if these \"accidents\" weren' t NASA's way of correcting mistakes and saying that some of these m en really didn't have the \"Right Stuff.\" After 1967, only Taylor died in another plane crash in 1970. An actu- arial statistician would probably go berserk over t hese numbers consider- ing how small the group was. Another weighty factor , even though they were \"hot\" pilots, the astronauts flew their traine r jets only part time. And add to that the fact that trainers are usually inhe rently safer than other planes in the same class. It would raise his eyebro ws to find how few of these men would ever enter space. I can't help but wonder what technicians serviced t heir ships—because what we have here is an appalling \"accident\" rate. They were the finest professional pilots in the world, operating governm ent planes where costs have little meaning. Yet they died. Even if we call the cremation an acci- dent we still have five more \"accident\" deaths in o ne year. Very inter- esting! I also wonder what the death rate was among the other NASA employees who were in position to know too much? THE PRELIMINARIES The first American in space was Alan Shepard, follo wed by Grissom and then Glenn. I'm convinced that every Mercury flight was real and that the phony missions only started after Grissom's Gemini 3. And even some of the later Gemini flights were real which leaves mos t of the original astronauts smelling like a rose. Unfortunately, Wal ly Schirra and NASA General Tom Stafford's Gemini 6A flight, with its m iracle of an undam- aged antenna, turned the rosy aroma into real toile t water. So did Alan Shepard's little golf game on the Moon during the A pollo 14 mission. All of these men barely entered near space (near-Ea rth-orbit) which I define as any altitude less than 500 miles. Far spa ce I reserve for those interstellar journeys that may come during the next millennium. That is, if we can solve our planetary problems before we disso lve in the stew cre- ated by the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse: War, F amine, Plague, Pestilence. And add a fifth \"horseman,\" Religious F anaticism, which fre- quently causes the other four. Every other \"race\" involving aircraft, from hot air balloons through"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"288 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries rocket planes, entailed serious efforts to go highe r and faster than the other guy. For good technical reasons neither we or the R ussians played that game. To this day our Shuttle flights are limited t o very near space usual- ly well under 200 miles in altitude. Most writers on the Apollo Program either totally i gnored, or played down, the fact that by early January 67, Grissom, w as no longer a happy camper. He was very disenchanted with both NASA and the prime cap- sule contractor, North American Aviation. This comp any had a phoenix- like ability to weather every storm, including the fire on Pad 34. It ulti- mately combined with Rockwell Engineering to become North American Rockwell. GRISSOM'S LEMON North American Rockwell's first Apollo capsule had been delivered and accepted by NASA in August 66, with a flight date s et for November. But time after time the date had to be reset because of problems with the craft. \"Grissom, a veteran of two test flights in Mercury and Gemini, normally quiet and easy-going, a flight pro, could not hide his irritation. 'Pretty slim' was the way he put his Apollo's chances of me eting its mission requirements.\" 1 According to Mike Gray, \"Grissom had a sense of une ase about this flight. He told his wife, Betty, 'If there ever is a serious accident in the space program, it's likely to be me.'\" 2 We will never know if this state- ment was the result of a psychic premonition or a b urgeoning fear of our government. Early in January 67, Grissom, probably unaware that NASA had other internal critics, hung a lemon on the Apollo capsul e. He was threatening to go public with his complaints. 3 He was already a popular celebrity, especially with the press. He would have had no pro blem in getting his story out. In a case like this even NASA's censors would have had little control over the news. Headlines like \"Popular Astr onaut Rips Into NASA!!\" couldn't be easily squelched. SPACE RADIATION NASA also had another serious problem, besides bein g in a space race with the Russian Bear. This problem derived from ou r first answer to the Sputniks. On January 31, 1958, Explorer 1 lifted in to orbit. It weighed a mere 18.3 pounds and carried a geiger counter which dutifully reported that a belt of intense radiation surrounded the Ear th. The belt was subsequently named after the Explorer Project Head, James A. Van Allen. However, the radiation was f i r s t predicted by Nikola Tesla around the beginning of this century as the r esult of experimental"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"The Suppression of UFO Technologies and Extraterres trial Contact 289 and theoretical work he had done on electricity in space in general and the electrical charge of the Sun in particular. He trie d then to tell our academic natural philosophers (scientists) that the Sun had a fantastic electrical charge and that it must generate a solar wind. But to no avail. The experts knew he was crazy. It would take almost sixty years to prove him right. However, predicting something is not the same as di scovery so the dis- covery of our magnetic girdle of radiation rightful ly belongs to the man who was suspicious enough to put a geiger counter o n board the satellite, whichever technician actually thought of it. Subsequent study showed that this belt, or belts, b egan in near space about 500 miles out and extends out to over 15,000 miles. Since the radi- ation there is more or less steady it obviously mus t receive as much radi- ation from space as it loses. If not it would eithe r increase until it fried the Earth or decay away to nothing. Van Allen belt radi ation is dependent upon the solar wind and is said to focus or concent rate that radiation. However, since it can only trap what has traveled t o it in a straight line from the Sun there remains a dangerous question: ho w much more radia- tion can there be in the rest of solar space? The Moon does not have a Van Allen belt. Neither do es it have a pro- tective atmosphere. It lies nakedly exposed to the full blast of the solar wind. Were there a large solar flare during any one of the Moon missions massive amounts of radiation would scour both the c apsules and the Moon's surface where our astronauts gamboled away t he day. The ques- tion is worse than dangerous—it's lethal! In 1963 the Russian space scientists told the famou s British astronomer, Bernard Lovell that they \"could see no immediate wa y of protecting cos- monauts from the lethal effects of solar radiation. \" 4 This had to mean that not even the much thicker metal walls used on the R ussian capsules could stop this radiation. How could the very thin metal— almost foil—we used on our capsules stop the radiation? NASA knew that. Space monkeys died in less than ten days but NASA never revealed their cause of death. Most people, even those interested in space, are st ill unaware that killer radiation pulses through space. I believe our ignor ance was caused by the people who sell us space sagas. Sitting in front of me is a 9-x-12-inch cof- fee table book titled The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Space Technology, printed in 1981. The words \"Space Radiation\" just d o not exist on any of its almost 300 pages. In fact with the dual excepti ons of Bill Mauldin's Prospects for Interstellar Travel published in 1992 and Astronautical Engineering and Science written by early NASA exper ts, no other book I have read even begins to discuss this extremely ser ious impediment to space flights. Do I detect the fine hand of my demo cratic government at work?"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"290 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries The Russians were in a position to know because as early as the spring of 61 their probes had been sent to the backside of the Moon. Upon his return to England Lovell sent this information to N ASA's deputy admin- istrator, Hugh Dryden. Dryden, representing NASA ob viously ignored it! Collins spoke of space radiation in only two places in his book. He said \"At least the moon was well past the earth's Van Al len belts, which prom- ised a healthy dose of radiation to those who passe d and a lethal dose to those who stayed.\" 5 In speaking of ways to dodge problems he wrote, \"In similar fashion, the Van Allen Radiation belts around the earth and the possibility of solar flares require understanding and planning to avoid exposing the crew to an excessive dose of radioactivity.\" 6 So what does \"understanding and planning\" mean? Doe s it mean that after the Van Allen Belts are passed that the rest of space is free of radia- tion? Or did NASA have a strategy for dodging solar flares once they were committed to the trip? It seems to imply that back in 1969 it was possible to predict solar flares. My astronomy text has this to say on that s ubject \"It is according- ly possible to predict only approximately the date of the future maximum and how plentiful the groups will then become.\" 7 This text was ten years old by 1969. Later in this book I will show that no thing had changed dur- ing the years of Apollo Moon missions. To continue with the Apollo Program after receiving this information implies that NASA knew something the Russians didn' t. Either we had developed an effective extremely light weight radia tion shield or NASA already knew that no one was going any where near t he Moon. Could the cloth in our space suits stop the radiati on? I doubt that because more than fifteen years have passed since t he partial core melt- down at TMI (Three Mile Island) and workers still c an't enter the con- tainment dome. We don't yet have the technology to create light weight flexible radiation shielding. High velocity could g et the capsule through the Van Allen belt but what could they do about sol ar flares during the rest of the trip to the Moon? And if we didn't go, why d idn't the Soviets, our arch enemies, rat us out? While I was thinking about this something rang a be ll. Around the time we were fighting communism in Vietnam (and other co untries in south- east Asia) we began to sell Russia, later to be cal led the Evil Empire, wheat by the mega-ton at an ultra-cheap price. On July 8, 1972 our government shocked the entire w orld by announc- ing that we would sell about one-fourth of our enti re crop of wheat to Russia at a fixed price of $1.63 per bushel. Accord ing to these sources we were about to produce another bumper crop while the Russian crop would"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"The Suppression of UFO Technologies and Extraterres trial Contact 291 be 10-20 percent less. The market price at the time of the announcement was $1.50 but immediately soared to a new high of $ 2.44 a bushel. 8 Guess who paid the 91 cents difference in price for the Russians? Our bread prices and meat prices were immediately infla ted reflecting the sud- denly diminished supply. It was the beginning of th e high inflation of the 70s. Now how much did the Moon cost us? Would our g overnment be a party to blackmail? Nah! However, if NASA knew that Kennedy's dream was impo ssible in the time frame given, they should have reported this to the President. We are civilized now and no longer cut off the right arm o f the messenger who brings bad news. Now we cut off budgets! That's saf er for the messenger but fatal to the bureaucracy in question. NASA must have decided if they couldn't make it the y would fake it. Big bucks were at stake here, to say nothing of Ame rican prestige. Those bucks, properly funneled, would buy a lot of southe ast Asia, at least for awhile. And with proper prestidigitation some of th e same could wind up in numbered accounts handled either by the \"gnomes of Zurich\" or off- shore Caribbean banks. NASA'S OTHER PROBLEM NASA's second problem was magnified as a result of the first. If they were really going to land on the Moon they would be able to take great quantities of real photos and pick up genuine Moon rocks. Such pictures should include the Earth rising or setting against a background of a bona fide starry sky. However, if they weren't actually going to the Moon , the evidence would have to be synthesized. Credible proof was vi tal to the continued high rate of funding and to NASA's very survival. N ASA's labs could cre- ate \"Moon rocks\" to the specifications of an educat ed, or rather an expect- ed, guess that would pass any inspection, because t here wasn't anything else to compare them to. Or they could have used rock samples picked up in A ntarctica during the intensive exploration of that continent during the International Geo- physical Year in 1957. They would do as well provid ed there were no fos- sils in them. These rocks could be slowly doled out , but only to those geol- ogists who could be counted on to agree with anythi ng the government said. And most of academia can be relied on to do j ust that! Strangely enough rocks were later found in Antarcti ca that closely resemble \"Moon rocks.\" In point of fact, some geolo gists are now posi- tive that these rocks were blasted from the Moon to Earth during immense meteoric impacts. However, true-to-the-Moon photos posed a bit more o f a problem. Because the twentieth century is the age of increas ingly sophisticated pho-"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"292 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries tography, huge amounts of tape and film had to be e xpended. NASA seemed to do precisely that. As Harry Hurt put it,\"... Pro ject Apollo was one of the most extensively documented undertakings in human h istory .. .\" 9 Despite this alleged fact and the fact that the NAS A Apollo mission photo numbers seem to indicate that thousands of pi ctures were taken, we keep seeing the same few dozen pictures in all the books on space. Using the well developed art of Hollywood style spe cial effects (FX) the astronauts could be photographed \"on the Moon\" in the top secret stu- dio set up near Mercury, Nevada. Of course, there i s a bit more to great FX than having the best equipment. As in any art fo rm, the artists are always more important than their tools. The backbon e of superb FX is lodged in the Hollywood professionals who devote th eir lives to it. Lacking access to these relatively liberal experts NASA was forced to use CIA hacks . . . relative amateurs. Nevertheless, they did their job well enough to pas s casual inspection for many years. It worked only because we wanted to bel ieve! As long as we had something to hang our hats on we could continue to have faith and ignore the anomalies in the evidence the photos provided. It w orked ... for a while! GRISSOM'S FINAL MISTAKE At the time of his death Grissom was one of NASA's old-timers. He was the man who, a few short years before, certified th at the astronauts had been involved in every step of the program and had been free to criticize at will, and even suggest ideas for improvements. H e was the man whose fatal error was no more than in being who he was; a n independent thinker ... a free spirit who seemed to be completely unawa re that NASA had wholeheartedly opted to enact the second part of th e old saying, \"If you can't make it, fake it!\" He had been selected as Commander of Apollo I, the first manned flight of the Apollo series. Grissom's crew included Edwar d H. White and Roger B. Chaffee. White flew on Gemini 4 but Chaffe e was a newcomer who had not as yet been in space, or verified the N ASA rite of passage by condemning the visibility of stars and planets. THE HANDICAP Right from the beginning, NASA was operating under a tremendous hand- icap. They were in a space race with a nation who, they knew, had opera- tional rockets that made ours seem like tinker toys by comparison. The Soviets started their space program in capsules tha t were 50 times heavier than those we were launching six months later. Russian capsules were closer to being compressed ai r tanks than flim- sy space capsules. Their ships had sufficient wall strength to maintain nor-"},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"The Suppression of UFO Technologies and Extraterres trial Contact 293 mal atmospheric pressure inside the craft against t he zero pressure outside in space. However, since we didn't have rockets to lift that sort of weight, we couldn't afford this luxury. We had to make ligh t, [almost] tin foil, cap- sules just to get into the ball game. The differential in pressure between the 14.7 psi ( our normal atmos- pheric pressure) and the zero pressure of space amo unts to 2116 pounds per square foot of outward loading on the enclosing wall of a capsule. Compare this figure with the floor of a house—which is designed to be safely loaded to only 30 pounds per square foot—and you will realize that relatively heavy metal is vital for skin and skelet on if you want to enjoy normal pressure. It is wall strength that prevents catastrophic and explo- sive depressurization of small capsules. The LEM's walls will be dis- cussed in more detail later in the book. BREATHING MIXTURES The greater lifting capacity of their rockets allow ed the Russians the lux- ury of using a mixture of 20 percent oxygen and 80 percent nitrogen—the equivalent to regular air. Naturally it wasn't stor ed on board as bulky \"compressed air.\" It was stored separately as liqui ds in cryogenic tanks. However, the nitrogen supply was smaller since the gas is inert to the human body and additional nitrogen is required only to help reestablish pressure when the cabin is vented to space. Oxygen tanks were larger because the only oxygen used is that small portion converted into CO 2 , by the necessity of breathing and this is immediately removed from the cabin by chemicals. A great deal is also lost when the ca bin is vented to space during depressurization. PURE OXYGEN Lacking strong walled capsules, NASA decided right from the beginning to use 50 percent oxygen and 50 percent nitrogen at 7 psi. This specifica- tion was changed in August 1962, into the use of pu re oxygen at 5 psi. 10 A policy shift of this nature indicates that approv ed design of the cap- sules being manufactured was weaker than expected. The amazing thing is that NASA made this deadly decision despite test ing that usually ended in disaster. One would think that after testing sho wed disaster that one would never implement a dangerous policy. But NASA was in a race with destiny. They had no time for common sense. NASA TESTS Here is a list of all government sponsored testing that resulted in oxygen fi r e s .

November 17, 1962—Another incident using 100 percen t oxygen at 5 psi in a chamber at the Navy Laboratory (ACEL).

January 1, 1967—The last known test was over three weeks before Grissom, Chaffee and White suffered immolation. Two men were han- dling 16 rabbits in a chamber of 100 percent oxygen at 7.2 psi at Brooks Air Force Base and all living things died in the in ferno. The cause may have been as simple as a static discharge from the rabbits' fur. . . but we'll never know. Of course, NASA's moronic decision to use pure oxyg en would play a crucial part in the deadly fire on Pad 34 a few yea rs later. Never mind that the test was classified as \"non hazardous\" by NASA. Only after Grissom, White and Chaffee died in that fire, would NASA aga in change the specs to either 60-40 or 50-50 oxygen/nitrogen mixes at 5 psi, depending on what source I've read. 11 "},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"The Suppression of UFO Technologies and Extraterres trial Contact 295 In pure oxygen at normal pressure even a piece of s teel wool will burn rapidly. In fact, Michael Collins claims that even stainless steel will burn. 12 As mentioned already an asbestos blanket, normally classed as fireproof, was consumed when used to smother flames during an oxygen fire. 13 Pure oxygen is extremely hazardous! To successfully switch to reduced pressure breathin g of pure oxygen one must first purge the body of nitrogen. This pre vents residual nitrogen left in the body from forming small bubbles which e xpand from the decreasing pressure. To deep sea divers this is kno wn as \"the bends.\" To avoid this lethal hazard astronauts must spend some period of time breath- ing 100 percent oxygen—which is medically dangerous — at full atmos- pheric pressure just before the mission. The pressure problem in a space capsule is [analogo us] to those encountered in a submarine. Submarine hulls are del iberately strong, to resist the increasing pressure at depth. If a subma rine hull was as thin as our space crafts—at 200 feet deep it would require an internal pressure of 100 psi—at 300 feet a pressure is 150 psi. PRESSURE TESTING The Apollo Program command capsules must be regarde d as flimsy, even though they were built of titanium which has the st rength of steel and weighs half as much. I reason that if our capsules were too weak to with- stand normal pressure they must also have been too weak to keep the atmosphere from crushing the capsule on the launchi ng pad. If this was true they had to be using 100 percent oxygen at nor mal pressure during the launch. It was found out that this is precisely what NASA d id on all their launches. It is obvious that the present Shuttles, with 50 tons of cargo capacity, could use normal pressure and regular air . However, the design- ers may still begrudge the few pounds of extra mate rial in the cabin that it takes to do this. By the same token our large di ameter commercial air- liners are able to maintain almost regular atmosphe ric pressure, and don't have to resort to pure oxygen, even when flying ove r 40,000 feet. Neither does the SST which hits altitudes of 60,000 feet. To insure the integrity of the capsule NASA subject ed it to their pres- sure test. One would assume that they would use com pressed air for this test because the electric panels had power and live men were inside the unit. However, when it came time to test the 012 ca psule on Pad 34 it was decided to use pure oxygen at a pressure somewhat a bove our atmospher- ic pressure of 14.7 psi. What the actual pressure w as is confusing. It was either 16.7 psi according to Michael Collins, or 20 .2 psi as reported by Frank Borman. 14 "},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"296 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries One would think that intelligent men with the \"Righ t Stuff' would pre- cisely know the pressures used. But either way, the re were astronauts locked inside—practicing for their first Apollo mis sion. After the accident NASA claimed the test was SOP (Standard Operating P rocedure). In either case an idiot was in charge. If it was SOP, then the idiot was the official who instituted and approved this test program. If not, then it was the low level idiot in direct charge of the test who gave the order to proceed. I have no fear of a libel suit because of this accusation. The only legal def ense in a libel suit is whether what you said was the truth, as determined by a jury. If you were on a jury and watched steel wool explode in a 16.7 psi 100 percent oxy- gen atmosphere what would you decide? I find it hard to believe that this test was SOP. I n fact, I suspect that it wasn't, simply because two men with the \"Right Stuf f' can't agree. NASA telling us after the fire that it was always done t hat way, doesn't prove a thing. NASA, like all political organizations, can always be counted on to say anything to better their position. Using pure o xygen at this pressure, once the panels were live, means that every launch was always one small spark away from disaster. Combustion in 100 percent oxygen even at low pressures, is extremely rapid. At higher pressures it becomes explosive! HIGH PRESSURE OXYGEN Consider this standard procedure: Burning a substan ce using high pres- sure oxygen is precisely the method used to determi ne the number of calo- ries in that substance. The test procedure requires placing the sample in a strong steel pressure vessel called a \"Calorimeter Bomb.\" The \"Bomb\" is placed in an insulated container of water holding a known quantity of water at a known temperature. There is an electrica l sparking device in- side the bomb and sufficient high pressure oxygen i s added to insure com- plete combustion of the material. Even relatively wet foodstuffs are quickly reduced to ashes once the electric spark initiates combustion. This process p roduces high pressures in the steel chamber. That's why it's called a Calo rimeter Bomb. The heat transfers to the surrounding water and the rise in temperature using known parameters results in the quantity of calories (ene rgy) in the substance tested. To get back to the discussion, every time an electr ic switch is thrown the induction of the electric current causes a tiny spark to jump between the two switch contacts. If the unit is explosion p roof (like the switches motors, and lighting fixtures used in hazardous or explosive locations), that spark is safely enclosed in a hermetically sca led container. If not any- t h i n g near it that is combustible can burn."},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"The Suppression of UFO Technologies and Extraterres trial Contact 297 In standard electrical switches the electrical insu lation is some form of plastic (hydrocarbon). All hydrocarbons can be oxid ized if there is suffi- cient oxygen and heat to raise the temperature of s ome small portion of that substance beyond the flash point. Bear in mind that an electric spark is a plasma. Indeed the temperature at the core of a large spark can be so high it is indeterminable. SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION The phenomena we call spontaneous combustion is als o oxidation. Under normal conditions oxygen in the air begins to oxidi ze almost any materi- al. In fact what we call rust on metal is supposed to be very slow oxida- tion. If the material is insulated to any degree, t he heat created by the process cannot escape as fast as it is generated. S o the entrapped heat cre- ates a small temperature rise which increases the r ate of oxidation. If some or all of that increased heat cannot escape there i s a self-escalating \"loop.\" The temperature continues to rise until the flash p oint is reached. At that point the material concerned bursts into flame. Tha t's \"spontaneous\" combustion. In an atmosphere containing a higher percentage of oxygen or a higher pressure the oxidation rate is greatly increased. I t is well known that a pile of oily rags in an oxygen environment will burst in to flame. In 100 per- cent oxygen any hydrocarbon or carbohydrate becomes potential fuel needing only a small spark or increase in heat to s et it off. THE TEST On January 27, 1967 astronauts Grissom, White and C haffee approached Pad 34 where an obsolete model of the command capsu le had been installed on top of an unfueled Saturn 1B rocket. 15 This was the same type of rocket that had carried the smaller and lighter Gemini capsules. The capsule itself was already outmoded and would be re placed before any Apollo missions were launched. However this was a full \"dress\" rehearsal. But some body neglected to tell the maintenance people to clean out all the ex tremely combustible extraneous construction materials. The urgency of t his test was simply that they were scheduled for a manned mission that had been repeatedly postponed. As we will see later, NASA had every int ention of sending Apollo I, Grissom's mission, into space even though neither that Saturn V (actual moon rocket), nor the Apollo capsule, had e ver actually been test- ed in space. Would you not have smelled a rat? Perhaps Grissom w as a bit worried because he got Wally Schirra to ask Joe Shea. NASA' s chief administra- tor, to go through that with him. \"Grissom still wa nted Shea to be with"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"298 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries him in the spacecraft. \" 16 Shea refused because NASA couldn't patch in a fourth headset in time for the test. Is that likely ? It is difficult to believe that this couldn't have been done in the 24 hour time frame available. If I had a crew of technician s who couldn't install another headset-jack in that amount of time I'd fir e the whole damn crew. The original Apollo capsule had different hatches, but by 1300 hours all three astronauts were strapped in their acceleratio n couches with the new hatches sealed behind them. It was later revealed t hat these hatches were so poorly designed that even with outside help and in a non-emergency situation, it took seven or eight minutes to open t hem. They were orig- inally supposed to spend a few hours practicing thr owing the proper switches at the right time in sequential response t o computer simulations. However, with delay piled upon delay and everyone i n a hurry, each time a switch was thrown, unnoticed by any, tiny sparks jumped. During the test of the Apollo capsule on Pad 34 Gri ssom and his crew were in 100 percent oxygen simulating the real thin g. In fact they report- ed a burning smell a few times earlier that day. Wh en that happened tech- nicians would come with \"sniffers,\" open the hatche s, but find nothing. One wonders if the review board considered that the se hatch openings flushed out the smell with the fresh air admitted b y opening the hatch. These incidents delayed the test and time was runni ng out. 17 The extrane- ous combustible materials may have been combining w ith the pressurized oxygen each time pure oxygen refilled the cabin. Ox idation makes heat, and if you stop the process that heat remains in th e material. Each time you repressurize the craft the combustible material will be at a slightly higher temperature. I sense that the board of revie w missed this angle. I also feel that spontaneous combustion would have been much too subtle for the CIA. If it was a CIA hit they would have done it with an electric squib or incendiary device wired to a swit ch programmed to be thrown toward the end of the test. While the testing was going on, some mastermind in mission control decided to save some time. In his wisdom that unkno wn leader made the decision to speed up the testing. As the board of i nquiry later noted, \"To save time, the space agency took a short cut.\" What he did was simply order the capsule to be pressurized with 100 percent oxyg en at either 16.7 or 20.2 psi. Notice, that no name was used. The entire agen cy takes the blame. I have great difficulty in believing that apparentl y not one of these rocket scientists in Control, nor the astronauts th emselves, knew that, a Calorimeter Bomb consists of a combustible material , pressurized oxygen and a spark. These were highly educated men, men wi th technical degrees, men who had taken chemistry courses, and men who mu st have spent some time around welding and cutting torches that u sed oxygen."},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"The Suppression of UFO Technologies and Extraterres trial Contact 299 Also I cannot understand why Grissom et al entered that capsule in the first place if they knew it was to be pressurized w ith oxygen over 14.7 psi. For example in a hospital no one is allowed to smok e in a room where oxygen is in use. In this situation we have only a small section of a room with tiny amounts of low pressure oxygen being used . Yet everyone seems to know of the danger. Grissom was a test pilot and engineer while both White and Chaffee had degrees in aeronautical engin eering. Apparently not one of them complained. Didn't anyone know abou t Calorimeter Bombs? Didn't NASA send them copies of the fire rep orts? Or maybe no one told them they were jacking up the pressure! At 1745 hours (5:45 P . M .) Grissom was getting angry with the commu- nication people for a static filled on again-off ag ain communication sys- tem. At one point he ragged them \"How do you expect to get us to the moon if you people can't even hook us up with a gro und station ? Get with it out there. \" 18 In the meantime around 6 P . M . Collins had to attend a general meeting of the astronauts. Let Collins tell you about it in an incredible single para- graph: 19 On Friday, January 27,1967, the astronaut office wa s very quiet and prac- tically deserted, in fact. Al Shepard, who ran the place, was off some- where, and so were all the old heads. But someone h ad to go to the Friday staff meeting, Al's secretary pointed out, a nd I was the senior astro- naut present, so off I headed to Slayton's office, note pad in hand, to jot down another week's worth of trivia. Deke wasn't th ere either, and in his absence, Don Gregory, his assistant presided. We ha d just barely gotten started when the red crash phone on Deke's desk ran g. Don snatched it up and listened impassively. The rest of us said no thing. Red phones were a part of my life, and when they rang it was usuall y a communications test or a warning of an aircraft accident or a plane alo ft in trouble. After what seemed like a very long time, Don finally hung up a nd said very quietly, \"Fire in the spacecraft.\" That's all he had to say. There was no doubt about which spacecraft (012) or who was in it (Grissom, W hite, Chaffee) or where (Pad 34 Cape Kennedy) or why (a final systems test) or what (death, the quicker the better). All I could think of was My God, such an obvious thing and yet we hadn't considered it. We w orried about engines that wouldn't start or wouldn't stop; we worried ab out leaks; we even wor- ried about how a flame front might propagate in wei ghtlessness and how cabin pressure might be reduced to stop a fire in s pace. But right here on the ground, when we should have been most alert, we put three guys inside an untried spacecraft, strapped them into co uches, locked two cumbersome hatches behind them, and left them no wa y of escaping a fire. Oh yes, if a booster caught fire, down below, there were elaborate if impractical, plans for escaping the holocaust by sl iding down a wire, but fire inside a spacecraft itself simply couldn't hap pen. Yet it had happened,"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"300 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries and why not? After all, the 100 percent oxygen envi ronment we used in space was at least at a reduced pressure of five po unds per square inch, but on the launch pad the pressure was slightly abo ve atmospheric, or nearly 16 psi. Light a cigarette in pure oxygen at 16 psi and you will get the surprise of your life as you watch it turn to a sh in about two seconds. With all those oxygen molecules packed in there at that pressure, any material generally considered \"combustible\" would i nstead be almost explosive. Here Collins reported that the pressure was 16 psi. Other authors went higher. A staff meeting at 6 P . M . on Friday night? Do you have a feeling that this Friday night staff meeting was the first and last in the long histo- ry of our government bureaucracies? THE FIKE At 6:31:03 P . M ., one of the astronauts smelled smoke and yelled fire . The capsule had suddenly turned into a Calorimeter Bomb . They tried their best to open the hatch. Without panic the triple ha tch that sealed them in usually took about nine minutes to open. They didn' t have nine minutes. In fact, they barely had ninety seconds before thei r suits burned through and the deadly poisonous gasses released from the p lastics silenced them forever. The capsule's internal pressure soared from the gre at quantity of hot gasses created by the quasi-explosive burning of al l the combustible mate- rial. This short term fire was so intense that it m elted a silver soldered joint on the oxygen feed pipe pouring even more oxygen in to the conflagration. At 6:31:17, fourteen seconds from the first smell o f smoke, the pressure reached 29 pounds and the capsule ruptured, effecti vely releasing the heat and damping the fire. But it was too late. They wer e already dead. Let me put in some additional questions here. If th is was not murder and just an example of extreme stupidity in governm ental slow motion why did government agents in rapid action, raid Gri ssom's home before anyone knew about the fire? Why did they remove all his personal papers and his diary? Why didn't they bring his diary, or any other paper with the word \"Apollo\" on it back, when they returned some o f his personal papers to his widow? And if it really took 29 psi to blow the cabin why didn't they use regular air at higher pressure? Also was it really the vicissitudes of life that th e outward opening hatch was coincidentally changed that very morning to one that opened inward? An inward opening hatch meant that any inside press ure, acting outward, would prevent it from being opened—even if someone was standing by, which they weren't. It was also boiled up from the outside and lacked explosive bolts. 20 "},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"The Suppression of UFO Technologies and Extraterres trial Contact 301 THE AFTERMATH NASA should have known better. And they did! You ha ve read earlier of the men injured in flash explosive fires in their own t ests. NASA had even com- missioned a report by Dr. Emanuel M. Roth which was published in 1964. Dr. Roth cited difficulties with 100 percent oxygen atmospheres even under low pressures. Any competent engineer should have k nown the dangers of oxygen at 16.7 or 20.2 psi. This is why I cannot be lieve that this was \"stan- dard operating procedure,\" or that Grissom and his crew knew that about it. NASA not only ignored their own tests on pure low p ressure oxygen but upped the ante by increasing the pressure above atm ospheric. Kennan and Harvey had this to say, \"Most U.S. scien tists could not believe their ears when they learned that fact. Oxy gen at such pressure comes in the category of an 'oxygen bomb.'\" 21 A Board of Inquiry termed \"The Apollo 204 Review Bo ard\" was quick- ly convened to investigate the fatal fire by appoin ting astronaut Frank Borman as the chairman. In effect, NASA sent the fo x into the chicken house to investigate mysterious disappearances of t he occupants. The board's final report was about what you might expec t when an inhouse investigation investigates itself: \"One key to the caution which reveals itself on every page of the Board's report is that it was written by govern- ment employees. Thompson himself was director of th e space agency's Langley Research center, and no fewer than six of t he eight Board mem- bers were NASA officials.\" 22 The pressure of 16.7 psi is quoted from Journey to Tranquility where the authors wrote that they learned the pressure of the pure oxygen in the capsule was 2 psi over atmospheric. Collins reporte d it as nearly 16 psi. It seems strange that NASA told two insiders, Borman a nd Collins, plus the authors of Tranquility three different capsule pres sures? Apparently NASA, like the rest of us find it almost impossible to ke ep all the little white lies straight. And if it's a group lie we get the result s shown in this book. Borman writes that, \"We brought in every learned mi nd we could enlist—including a chemistry expert from Cornell . . .\" 23 Didn't this expert know that oxygen has a deep and forceful des ire to breed little oxides by passionately mating with hydrocarbons and carbohydrates? Didn't this \"so-called\" expert tell them that? Borman, played dumb when he was called before Congr ess. In testify- ing under oath he said, \"None of us were fully awar e of the hazard that existed when you combine a pure-oxygen atmosphere w ith the extensive distribution of combustible materials and a likely source of ignition . . . and so this test... was not classified as hazardous .\" 24 And if Borman was as unaware of all the dangerous fires that erupted during NASA's own"},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"302 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries safety tests over the years why did he later write about 20.2 psi oxygen in this manner, \"That is an extremely dangerous enviro nment, the equivalent of sitting on a live bomb, waiting for someone to l ight the fuse. \" 25 Aldrin in his 1989 book, Men From Earth written twe nty-two years after the cremation has this to say, \"As every high school chemistry stu- dent learns, when a smoldering match is put into a beaker of oxygen, it blazes into a spectacular flame.\" 26 He (Aldrin) continues by telling us how there was a multitude of switches and miles of electrical wiring all of whic h were easy to short and could act as a match. \"But the risk was considered acceptable because, in space, the astronauts could instantly depressurize their cabin . . .\" 27 Hey Buzz, didn't you claim that the reason your EVA [ex travehicular activity] on the Moon was late in starting because it took so long to vent the last of the oxygen from the LEM? Say what? Borman, who held a Masters in engineering and taught ther- modynamics at West Point claims nobody was aware of the danger! After all these years Aldrin now claims he knew. Obviousl y, either Borman is lying or Aldrin didn't have the guts to open his mo uth. When Deke Slayton was asked about the pressure test he reportedly blurted out, \"Man, we've just been lucky. We've use d the same test on everything we've done with the Mercury and the Gemi ni up to this point, and we've just been lucky as hell.\" 28 Why do I doubt that? I suspect that everything abou t the pressurization test is a lie. I think that it was a one time only occurrence specially con- figured to suit the job at hand. Borman contended that Ed White and his wife Pat wer e friends of his and that he listened to the audio tapes of the fire over and over again. Then he states, \"The only comfort derived from listening to the tapes was the knowledge that the agony hadn't lasted long; that d eath had come from noxious fumes before the flames reached them.\" 29 Borman's acumen might be judged by the fact that Ea stern Airlines played submarine when he was at the helm as CEO. No body dies in 14 seconds from noxious fumes. Ed White died inhaling super heated oxygen which set fire to his lungs, throat and skin the sa me way that technician's hand burned in the test years before. The chances a re that they survived for minutes and were conscious for a good part of t hat time. However, death was definite after the first breath. Borman then writes about \"nuts\" and disgruntled emp loyees who tried to give his committee information: As the investigation progressed, all sorts of nuts came out of the wood- work with their own theories. There also were some serious allegations"},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"The Suppression of UFO Technologies and Extraterres trial Contact 303 directed against North American Aviation, most of t hem coming from for- mer employees with large axes to grind. They charge d the the compa- ny with criminal neglect and mismanagement, and we investigated each accusation thoroughly. We found that in every case we were getting input from people who simply had personal grievance s against the com- pany, with no evidence to back them up. 30 That's odd! One of Borman's superiors, General Phil lips, had also made a report in November, 1966 that shredded North American Aviation. He could hardly be classified as a disgruntled empl oyee. Speaking of clas- sified, Michael Gray in his book disclosed the fact that Phillip's report was classified. 31 Borman apparently ignored that report. Time and time again, NASA has bragged about how ope n NASA was. One wonders, then, who classified this report? What could it possibly have had to do with national security? No wonder th at Bill Kaysing was never able to obtain a copy. To paraphrase an old s aying, the \"TOP SECRET\" stamp, because it reflects patriotism, has always been the last refuge of scoundrels. On April 27, 1967 the 204 Board was still in the pr ocess of almost learning new things. A low level employee named Tho mas Baron had already testified in Washington and now was a targe t for NASA's ire. His voluminous reports were day by day accounts of Nort h American's screw- ups and were written years earlier. It seems very s trange that both Baron's and Phillips' reports disappeared. After accepting his reports, the 204 Board wrote off his testimony. By the very next evening Baron, his wife and stepda ughter would all be dead. The two women were totally innocent but, mayb e, that's what they get for associating with a NASA whistle-blower. One of the common accidents to governmentally sensi tive folks in Florida is the old railroad crossing gambit. There are lots of semi-desert- ed country roads and active railroad tracks in Flor ida. Usually after the grisly event, the bodies are found by someone so po werful that he can have them immediately cremated, frequently before a n autopsy can be performed—which is contrary to Florida state law. A nd they used to tell us horror stories about the KGB! I no longer live i n Florida so if they come after me for writing these words they will hav e to think up a new method. And please note: I am not suicidal. I say that beca use suicide is a com- mon cause of death in this context. For instance th ere is a suspicion that another casualty of NASA is Mrs. Pat White, who com mitted suicide a few years alter her husband's cremation. From post-mort em reports—she was- n't suicidal cither. Low level whistle blowers die like flies and yet, General Phillips, goes on to head NASA after he told basica lly the same story."},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"304 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries Borman also complained about the windows that kept fogging up on his Gemini 7 mission and again on Apollo 8. North A merican, for four straight years failed to find a solution for such a simple problem as win- dow fogging yet he couldn't find anything seriously wrong with them. That's about par, isn't it? Borman was stationed at Clark Air Force base in Man ila during 1952 and part of his duty was to inspect a huge warehous e that stored heavy equipment, supposedly ready to roll on an instant's notice. His inspection revealed that, \"there wasn't a vehicle or a piece o f equipment that wasn't in deplorable shape—most of it unusable without maj or overhauls.

The new m oral code is appar- ently totally dependent upon the rank of the office r who gives the order? Go along to get along. Next Borman, still the politician that Collins firs t pegged him for, tells perhaps the greatest lie of his life. He concludes, \"We didn't sweep a sin- gle mistake under the rug, and to this day I'm prou d of the committee's honesty and integrity. \" 33 Presumably Mr. Borman, had his fingers crossed when he wrote that! The committee was still in the middle of its statel y review process when on April 7, 1967, a House subcommittee was als o convened to investigate the fire. The next day a dismayed New Y ork Times fired off a lead editorial. They used the words, \"Even a high s chool chemistry stu- dent\" (knows better than to play with 100 percent o xygen). The editorial went on to accuse those in charge of the Apollo pro ject of \"incompetence and negligence. \" 34 The 204 Board concluded with a real wrist spanker o f a statement against NASA: A sealed cabin, pressurized with a pure oxygen atmo sphere without thought of fire hazard; an overly extensive distrib ution of combustible materials in the cabin; vulnerable wiring carrying spacecraft power; leaky plumbing carrying a combustible and corrosive coolant; inade- quate escape provisions for the crew, and inadequat e provisions for res- cue or medical assistance. Both committees would prove about as useful as a sc reen door in space (and about as effective as the politicians who mann ed the Warren Commission's investigation of the Kennedy assassina tion a few years"},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"The Suppression of UFO Technologies and Extraterres trial Contact 305 before). Like all government inquisitions they use a method best described as \"let's all gang-bang the whistle-blowe r.\" At the beginning of the Mercury Program, NASA tests on pure oxygen proved that the safe pressure limit for breathing w as between 2.9 and 6.67 psi. But they also concluded that pressures, \"outsi de these limits would cause severe, if not permanent damage. \" 35 In plain English, murder begins at 6.7 psi! Kennan & Harvey have this to say about the fatal te st on the capsule, \"The day of the plugs-out test, the TV camera insid e the space-craft, which was an important piece of flight and test equ ipment, was absent; its retaining brackets had some how been bent during in stallation.\" 36 These authors never called it murder but they conti nued with this state- ment, \"It is of the greatest significance that the fire extinguishers were located in that (008) spacecraft during its testing . Not only were fire extin- guishers included but fire resistant teflon sheets were draped over wire bundles and the astronaut's couches. These particul ar items, non flight items, were conspicuously absent in command module 012 during the fatal plugs-out test on January 27, 1967.\" 37 They also summed up the test with these statements: It was the first and only use of the new three piec e hatch. It was the first plugs-out test in which as many as three hatches were closed on a crew in an oxygen atmosphere at a press ure of sixteen pounds per square inch . . . It was the first occasion of the Apollo emergency e scape drill under all- out pre-launch conditions. It was the first occasion when certain non flight f lammable materials, such as two foam rubber cushions—were placed in the cockpit. 38 Later NASA would rule out the use of any material w hich could be ignit- ed by spark at 400°F in pure oxygen at 16.7 psi. 39 \"They included the couch padding, to which astronaut White's body was welded by the heat: this, it emerged, could be ignited by a spark at 25 0°F.\" 40 Notice they still had every intention of using 16.7 psi oxygen. Or wa s it 20.2 psi? If a civilian corporation killed three men by extre me stupidity there would be criminal proceedings, trials and fines. Bu t because the govern- ment is the suspected culpable party nothing happen s. To repeat: I cannot believe that in such a highly technical field as sp ace that even the lowest paid technician would not have questioned the moron ic decision to use 100 percent oxygen to try a pressure test on a caps ule with live electric panels, and which contained locked in and strapped down astronauts.

Clifford of the Pen tagon announced at a press conference (The Star, New York, 5 October 198 2) that contact between U.S. citizens and extra-terrestrials or their vehic les is strictly illegal. According to a law already on the books (Title 14, Section 1211 of the Code of Federal Regulations, adopted on 16 July 196 9, before the Apollo moon shots), anyone guilty of such contact automati cally becomes a wanted criminal to be jailed for one year and fined U.S. $5,000. The NASA administrator is empowered to determine, w ith or without a hearing, that a person or object has been \"extra- terrestrially exposed\" and impose an indeterminate quarantine under armed guard, which could not be broken even by court order. There is no limit placed on the number of individua ls who could thus be arbitrarily quarantined. The definition of \"extra-terrestrial exposure\" is l eft entirely up to the NASA administrator, who is thus endowed with total dictatorial powers to be exercised at his slightest caprice, which is com pletely contrary to the Constitution. According to Dr. Clifford, whose commanding officer s have been assuring the public for the last thirty-nine years that UFOs are nothing more than hoaxes and delusions to be dismissed with a condescending smile, \"This is really no joke; it's a very serious matter.\" This legislation was buried in the 1211th subsectio n of the 14th section of a batch of regulations very few members of gover nment probably both- ered to read in its entirety—the proverbial needle in the haystack—and was slipped onto the books without public debate. Thus from one day to the next we learn that without having informed the public, in its infinite wisdom, the government of the United States has created a whole new criminal class: UFO contactees.

This is certainly one of the many possibiliti es inherent in such con- tact, but just as certainly not the only one, and i n itself not a valid reason to make all contact illegal or to declare contactee s criminals to be jailed and fined immediately. It appears the primary effect of such a law would n ot be to prevent con- tact: it would be to silence witnesses. According to NASA spokesman Fletcher Reel, the law as it stands is not immediately applicable, but in case of need cou ld quickly be made applicable. What this means is that it is ambiguous ly worded, so that it can be interpreted either one way or the other, as the government desires. It is certainly not a coincidence that Dr. Clifford held his press confer- ence during the period when the popularity of the f ilm E. T. was at its peak. As E. T. portrayed a type of extra-terrestrial that was benevolent and lov- able, the inference is that the press conference wa s intended to discourage attempts to communicate or fraternize with UFO occu pants. However, instead of having the intended effect, it backfired , causing public furore. There may be some relationship between this fiasco and the next semi- officially endorsed attempt to deal with the subjec t of extra-terrestrials, the TV series V which was featured with repeat perf ormances and maxi- mum publicity by major networks worldwide. The alie ns portrayed in V are the most horrifying and repulsive nightmares im aginable, but are defeated thanks largely to a CIA hit man specializi ng in covert operations."},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"The Stonewalling of High Strangeness George Andrews A large crack appeared in the stonewalling of high strangeness on October 14, 1988. On that date, there was a semi-official a dmission of extra-ter- restrial intervention in human affairs, in the guis e of a two-hour TV spe- cial entitled UFO COVER-UP? . . . LIVE! Participati on by U.S. and Soviet officials was so extensive that the broadcas t could not have oc- curred without the consent of both governments. The program was presented to the public simultaneou sly in the United States and the Soviet Union, the first time in hist ory that any TV program had received such preferential treatment. However, in spite of this clearly implied U.S.-U.S.S.R. seal of approval (or perhaps because of it?), the program contained a clever mix of information and d isinformation. The valid information was that we are not alone, an d that the govern- ment has made a hitherto secret agreement with shor t gray humanoids (the \"Grays\") who say they are from Zeta Reticuli. Although it was not specifically stated that the Gr ays were the only E.T. group our government has made contact with, that im plication was made. To the extent the implication was made, it was a fa lsehood. UFO COVER-UP? . . . LIVE!, hosted by Mike Farrell, implied that Uncle Sam had made a smart deal. However, the truth of the matter is that this deal was the most disastrous mistake, not only in the history of our nation, but in the history of our entire civilizati on. There were other E.T. groups that we could have made incomparably better arrangements with. Although this scandal is similar in nature to the I ran-Contra deal, it is a tragedy on a scale of such unprecedented magnitude that in comparison Iran-Contra seems like very small change indeed. The case of contactee Edouard \"Billy\" Meier in Swit zerland, which Mike Farrell stigmatized as \"an obvious hoax,\" is n ot without its ambigu- ities, absurdities and contradictions. Nevertheless , the physical evidence is so strong that this is one of the best substanti ated cases on record. Dr. James Deardorff has speculated that the E.T.s may b e making deliberate"},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"312 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries use of absurdity as a form of strategic camouflage, in order to ensure grad- ual rather than sudden realization of their presenc e. By cloaking their activities in an aura of absurdity, they repel seri ous investigation and make people hesitate to endorse the reality of the phenomena, keeping it all borderline and marginal, which distracts human attention from their presence. If this is the game that is going on, the E.T.s may be feeding Meier a mixture of truth and falsehood, which he relays to the public in the sincere belief that it is all true. For example, Meier believes himself to be the only genuine UFO con- tactee, an obvious absurdity, because there have be en thousands of gen- uine human-alien contact cases during recent years. He also states that the many thousands of abduction and crop circle inciden ts reported during recent years were all hoaxes, another obvious absur dity. I concur with Deardorff that Meier is sincere in his beliefs, but that he is being fed infor- mation mixed with disinformation. One of the most curious aspects of the Meier case i s the veritable obses- sion displayed by the goverment's plainclothes medi a agents (such as William Moore who has publicly admitted his links w ith government agencies) in over-zealous attempts to discredit the evidence. An all-out media vendetta has been waged against the Meier cas e that seems totally out of proportion with the investgation of any one single UFO case. Is this because Meier's contact was not with the Zeta Grays but with a rival E.T. group that in appearance is almost indistinguishabl e from us, and which shares a common ancestry with us, known among resea rchers as the Blonds or Swedes? This is the same group that was k nown in antiquity to the Scandinavians as the Aesir, to the Irish as the Tuatha Te Danaan, and by other names in other cultures. One of the modern Soviet cases men- tioned on the Mike Farrell program, in which the UF O opened up like a flower, was an encounter with the Blonds, a group w ith whom I think we could work out a valid alliance.

Note just some of the cast of characte rs: 1) A Russian sci- entist, revealing that aliens have landed in Russia and contacted their military personnel. 2) Two CIA agents, indentities disguised, revealing that extra-terrestrial aliens are now the \"guests o f the U.S. Government.\" 3) About a hundred residents of Gulf B reeze, Florida, who have witnessed and photographed the extensive UFO a ctivity in their home town. 4) Abductees telling their own stories u nder hypnosis. 5) Expert witnesses from the military saying that sigh tings they reported while in service 'disappeared' from the records. 6) A psychiatrist report- ing that abductees she has treated were sane and su ffering from trau- ma as a result of their contact with aliens. 7) Evi dence by investigators of crashed UFO sites. 8) Testimony from Budd Hopkin s, who has inves- tigated hundreds of abductee cases for over 12 year s, that genetic experiments are being performed by aliens on humans on a large scale. 9) Other witnesses, each expert in his/her own fiel d, testifying to the validity of photographic or other tangible document ation of UFOs. 10) Paintings of aliens drawn by artists from the testi mony of witnesses. Surely, even by Hollywood standards, here are all t he ingredients of a box-office hit. Was it a hit? Well, during the two- hour show, 75,000 view- ers did pay one dollar each to have their phone-in vote about their belief in human-alien contact recorded. What other signs o f success made the front page? Not a one! The show was a flop in terms of arousing public interest. How can this be? How could such a careful ly concocted combi- nation of ingredients, culminating in the most news worthy disclosure in history, not elicit a bang, nor even a whimper? I played a videotape of the show to my adult educat ion class on alien- human contact. I watched the reactions of my class members. Thanks to the review/playback capability, I was able to condu ct some experiments. The adult students who signed up for this course we re believers in the possiblity of human-alien contact. Some even had pe rsonal experience of contact, yet after the screening they were more dou btful than before! I then recognized that UFO COVER-UP? . . . LIVE! made brilliant use of the best propaganda techniques. If you have a tape of the show, watch it again, and listen carefully to the soundtrack. Look at the painted back- drops and, most important, look at Mike Farrell's r eactions. You will see and hear some interesting contradictio ns. The astute view- er cannot dismiss these contradictions as sloppy pr oduction. The produc- tion had a huge budget and was planned many months in advance. In fact, Budd Hopkins reported to me that each witness was i nterviewed at length before the show, then certain words of that intervi ew were selected to be used. The words were put on cue cards, and on the n ights of the show, the witnesses were allowed to say only what was on the cards. UFO COVER- UP? . . . LIVE! was carefully rehearsed. Reading fr om cue cards, unless"},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"314 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries one is experienced in doing so, gives words a stilt ed sound that many lis- teners take as phony. Score one for not believing t he witnesses. Score two: When words are spoken over background mu sic, the music makes an unconscious impression that flavors the em otional impact of the words. For example, the relentless \"approach,\" loud er and louder in inten- sity, of the orchestration of the Jaws soundtrack a s the shark nears its vic- tim builds up a feeling of dread even before any ac tion takes place. The background music for UFO COVER-UP? . . . LIVE! is l ight, pleasant dance music. While the Russian is speaking of terri fying abductions, the music is a rousing polka! Score three: When the Russian says, \"The aliens com municated with the terrified soldiers by mental telepathy,\" Mike F arrell responds, \"Oh, they used music, just like in the movie Close Encou nters.\" We depend very much on the reaction of others to set our own reaction. Obviously, if someone tells you a story and they are laughing, yo u think the story is funny. If they are in a panic state while telling i t to you, you think of it as tragic. Throughout of the entire show, Mike Farrell reacted to all the UFO information with puzzlement, but in an amused and l ight-hearted manner. So, for the most part, the audience did too. Score four: Through the skillful but unobtrusive us e of another media technique, the painted backdrop against which the a lien Grays are por- trayed is a bright sunny room overlooking a garden! Nothing to take seri- ously there, certainly nothing to worry about. Also the depictions of the Grays were idealized and did not conform to witness descriptions, giving the impression of beni gn Disneyesque ani- mated characters. Score five: Another powerful media technique is to trivialize something important by focusing on a tiny detail. For example , telling the audience that the aliens \"prefer strawberry ice cream\" reduc es these mysterious life forms to a childish format. Score six: We are so accustomed to Hollywood movies that we are entertained by a \"historical\" film, but never for a moment truly believe that the \"action\" taking place on the screen is rea l. We know it is rehearsed and played by actors. When Mike Farell puts the UFO reports in the same category as the movie Close Encounters, the audienc e automatically thinks of the TV documentary UFO COVER-UP? ... LIVE ! as just anoth- er Hollywood movie. No one writes a letter to the e ditor of their local newspaper or phones their Congressman to demand act ion about a crime committed in a Hollywood movie. There is more. One of the women presented in the do cumentary who has been abducted by aliens is an acquaintance of m ine. Her entire life has been affected by her terrifying alien contact.

They took it to be comical. Neither my students nor the majority of the viewing audience took the UFO COVER-UP! . . . LIVE! program seriously. That i s why there was no audience response. One of my students said he th ought, \"The man por- traying the Russian couldn't have been a real Russi an, because he spoke English too well.\" No doubt he was trying to accoun t for why the show did not have the ring of truth to it. The question remains: were the producers of the sho w, whoever they really are, pleased that their show was a \"flop,\" i n that few viewers took the reality of alien-human contact (or invasion) se riously? Or were they disappointed by the lack of audience response? What , indeed, was the real purpose of this carefully staged show? The format in which UFO COVER-UP? ... LIVE! was pre sented tran- quilized the general public, as did the movies E.T. and Close Encounters of the Third Kind, in the comfortable belief that t here is absolutely noth- ing to worry about, as far as any reports of allege d \"aliens\" are concerned. As Dr. Mundy has pointed out, this comfortable beli ef system—so assiduously maintained by the authorities through t heir constant insis- tence on relegating the subject of alien interventi on in human affairs to the realm of media trivia—relies for its support on som e very thin ice indeed. This ice is so thin that it can be shattered by fea therweight random events, such as the arrival in my mailbox of a lett er from Rev. John E. Schroeder of the UFO Study Group of Greater St. Lou is, saying: You mentioned William Moore's TV program hosted by Mike Farrell. Is it any surprise that the November 1989 issue of pre stigious Millimeter magazine for film and TV producers listed the CIA a s paying producer for that show? I wonder what happened to the respon se requests? Who effectively collected whose paying phone numbers? W hy? How are they to be used? Was any data ever given congressional m embers? The plot thickens! The plot does indeed thicken. A search of the Novem ber 1989 issue of Millimeter magazine did not locate the item which R ev. Schroeder is nev- ertheless sure that he and his wife saw in Millimet er, though he may have been mistaken as to the issue. This does not necess arily mean that the item does not exist, but as we go to press the question remains unresolved. In spite of this uncertainty, the item seems worth ret aining, because both the possibility and the questions raised by Rev. Schroe der remain relevant, even if neither confirmed nor invalidated.

The average person feels threatened or terrified by any unprecedented divergence from conventionally accepted norms of re ality, and may react with dangerous violence. Let us consider the case of Herbert Schirmer, who i n 1967 held the dis- tinction of being the youngest Chief of Police in N ebraska, and who was one of the most prominent citizens in his home town of Ashland, Nebraska. One night while on duty in his patrol car , he encountered a large disc-shaped UFO, which had landed not far fro m the highway. When a glowing humanoid figure appeared in his headlight s, he tried to draw his gun, but found himself inexplicably paralyzed. When the humanoid opened the door of his car, Schirmer felt a cold ha rd instrument being applied to the back of his neck, and he blacked out . Upon regaining con- sciousness, he drove straight back to the police st ation and reported the incident to his fellow officers, who noticed that h e was unable to account for about half an hour, There was an unusual welt o n the back of his neck, which later left a permanent scar. A qualified hypn otist, Dr. Leo Sprinkle, was brought in to regress him back to the period of missing time. Under hypnosis, the regression indicated that he had been taken aboard the UFO and had communicated with a group of alien humanoid s during the peri- od of missing time. A search of the location where the incident occurred revealed physical landing traces. How did Chief of Police Schirmer's old friends reac t to his adventure? By firing him from his job, dynamiting his car, and hanging and burning him in effigy in the town square. His wife divorced him, and he was driv- en out of town. He has since moved frequently, cont acting various UFO investigators, trying to make sense of his dilemma. There is a remarkable resemblance between Herbert S chirmer's ordeal and the Jeff Greenhaw case. In 1973, Jeff Greenhaw was the youngest Chief of Police in Alabama, and was one of the most prominent citizens in his home town of Falkville, Alabama. One night he r eceived an anonymous phone call from a woman who said that a UFO had jus t landed in a field not far from town. Greenhaw got into his patrol car and drove toward that area. As he approached the field, he encountered a humanoid about six feet tall, covered from head to foot in metallic clothin g, standing in the middle of the road. Greenhaw pulled up near him and said: \"Howdy, stranger.\" There was no response. Greenhaw reached for a Polar oid camera he hap- pened to have with him and took four pictures. Then he turned on the flash- ing blue light on the top of his patrol car. The hu manoid began to run, but not in normal fashion, moving sideways instead of f orward, taking large leaps of about ten feet at a time very quickly, tra ve l i n g at extraordinary speed. Greenhaw began to pursue him, but his patrol car suddenly went out"},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"The Suppression of UFO Technologies and Extraterres trial Contact 317 of control and into a spin as he reached 45 miles p er hour, obliging him to give up the chase. He returned to town and reported the incident. How did Chief of Police Greenhaw's old friends reac t to his adventure? By firing him from his job, dynamiting his car, and burning down the trail- er in which he lived. His wife divorced him, and he was driven out of town. He has since disappeared. These two cases are not isolated. One could easily fill a book with the many cases of UFO contactees who have been obliged to leave their homes and change their names because of hostile social pr essures. As our history clearly indicates, such witch hunts are nothing new . The average citizen's tolerance of diversity has increased only minimally since medieval times. What sets the Schirmer and Greenhaw cases apart fro m the hundreds, if not thousands, of other cases of contactee harassment i s the secure social posi- tion they both enjoyed, until they reported their U FO encounters. Being the Chief of Police in a small town one has g rown up in implies widespread respect and trust from a closely knit gr oup of people who have known you since childhood, and is about as secure a social position in the hierachy of the American system as it is possible t o attain. The fact that one encounter with the unknown could in one day tra nsform the role model for an entire community into a despised outca st demonstrates the extreme extent to which the average citizen feels i nsecure, and therefore fears the unknown. This is true on the national level as well as on th e individual level. The thousands of documents that the government has been obliged to release under the Freedom of Information Act demonstrate th at its internal policy concerning UFOs and extra-terrestrials is extremely different from its publicly stated policy. To put it bluntly, our gove rnment has been lying to its citizens about UFOs and extra-terrestrials for over 40 years. To point out merely one example of this duplicity: Air Force Regulation 200-2, JANAP-146* provides a penalty oft en years in prison plus a $10,000 fine and a forefeiture of pay and pe nsion for any member of the Armed Forces who makes an unauthorized state ment about UFOs. If you write to the Library of Congress and ask for a copy of this regula- tion, you will get an answer stating that no such r egulation exists. Air Force spokesmen blandly deny that any such regulati on exists. However, if you write to the Library of Congress and ask for a copy of The UFO Enigma by Marcia Smith and David Havas, which was p ublished by none other than the Library of Congress itself in 1983, you will find in it a statement that Major Donald Keyhoe was the first to make public refer- ence to the previously secret JANAP-146. Further details are to be found in a book by a well -known French * Joint-Army-Navy-Air Forve Publication"},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"318 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries researcher, Aime Michel, published in 1969. The pre face to a previous book by Michel was written by General L. M. Chassin , General Air Defense Coordinator, Allied Air Forces, Central Eur ope, NATO. General Chassin commends Michel's ability and integrity in strong terms. The statement Michael made in 1969 translates as follow s: \"However, if it is so certain that for the American authorities this s ubject is no more than crazy stories that are completely without interest, how does one explain the extraordinary precautions in Air Force Regulati on 200-2, and the ten years in prison plus $10,000 fine of JANAP-146, all of which are still being enforced fifteen years later, and more vigoro usly than ever?\" Since Michel stated in 1969 that the regulation had been enforced for fif- teen years, it must have originated in 1954, which just happens to have been a year during which an exceptional amount of UFO ac tivity took place. According to Ralph and Judy Blum, who received assi stance from government sources while compiling their excellent book Beyond Earth (Bantam, 1974), the text of JANAP-146 is contained in an official publi- cation of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, entitled Canad ian-United States Communications Instructions for Reporting Vital Int elligence Sightings (CIR-VIS/MERINT, JANAP 146). As the vast majority of UFO incidents get coverage only in local news- papers, if they even get that, there is no general awareness of the persist- ent UFO activity occurring in other parts of the co untry and other parts of the world. Some stories in the media even state tha t UFO activity is now almost non-existent and was just a passing fad of t he 50s and 60s, when the truth is that there are just as many incidents as there ever were, but that the covert censorship is being enforced more effect ively. Major wire services operate in collusion with gover nmental intelligence agencies in perpetrating this devious form of camou flaged censorship for one basic reason, as clearly expressed by nuclear p hysicist Stanton Fried- man: \"No government of Earth would want its citizen s to pledge allegiance to the planet rather than to itself, and to think o f themselves first as Earthlings, rather than as Americans, Canadians, Ru ssians, etc.\" On pages 188-191 of Extra-Terrestrials Among Us, I described the adventures of an officer using the pseudonym of \"To ulinet,\"who had been assigned to write an analysis of the top secret \"Gr udge 13\" report, after which he has been summarily discharged from militar y service. During the summer of 1989, this man took the courageous st ep of publicly inden- tifying himself as former Captain William English o f the Green Berets, who had been working at the RAF Security Services C ommand, RAF Chicksands, England, at the time that he was assign ed to write the analy- sis of \"Grudge 13.\" I have been unable to either co nfirm or invalidate the rumor that no sooner had he publicly identified him self than his residence"},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"The Suppression of UFO Technologies and Extraterres trial Contact 319 was firebombed, as had been the residences of polic e chiefs Schirmer and Greenhaw in 1967 and 1973. Attempts have been made to destroy English's credib ility, such as the U.S. Army stating that it has no military records c oncerning him. How- ever, it is standard operating procedure for milita ry commanders to delete, either partially or in totality, the service record s of subordinate person- nel who have become security risks, as is examplife d in \"The Cutolo Affidavit,\" published in Erase and Forget by Parago n Research, P.O. Box 981, Orlando FL 32802, in 1991. Records are also systematically destroyed by the hi ghly paid defense contractors engaged by the Pentagon for secret proj ects. In November 1989, physicist Robert Lazar went public with discl osures concerning alien discs and related activities at Area 51 of th e Nevada Test Site. From one day to the next, all records of his previous em ployment, his education, and even of his birth, vanished as if by magic. Thi s would have effective- ly destroyed his credibility, if there had not been certain items that sur- vived the onslaught of the modern Inquisitors. For example, Lazar stated that he had worked as a physicist for Los Alamos Na tional Laboratories, whose representatives denied that he had ever been employed by them. However, independent investigators found a copy of the telephone direc- tory issued by the Los Alamos Lab in 1982, which li sted Robert Lazar among the scientists employed by them. An article i n the Los Alamos paper during that same year, 1982, described Lazar' s interest in jet cars, mentioning his employment at the Los Alamos Lab as a physicist. Finding themselves unable to destroy Lazar's credibility in any other way, the authorities resorted to a crude but time-tested tec hnique and tarnished his reputation with a sex scandal, which Lazar's lifest yle unfortunately made possible. Some people have taken issue with my statement that we are about to experience direct confrontation with non-human inte lligent beings from elsewhere in the cosmos in the near future, pointin g out that UFO inter- vention in human affairs has been minimal during th e last forty years, so why shouldn't that pattern continue indefinitely? I have answered that question at length in my previous book, but would l ike to extend my response by describing some major incidents that oc curred since its pub- lication, which clearly indicate that we have enter ed a new phase of UFO activity, a phase characterized by deliberate and o stentatious UFO dis- plays over heavily populated areas on an unpreceden ted scale. There was a flurry of significant UFO activity both before and after August 12, 1986, but it was on the night of August 12-13 that the climax of the first incident occurred. During that night, reports came flooding in from Lake Huron to Nova Scotia in Canada, and in th e United States"},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"320 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries from Maine, New York, Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, Arkansas, Louisiana, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Florida , as well as from the town of Leongatha in the province of Victoria in Au stralia. There had also been multi-witness sightings of a large UFO in Penn sylvania. Both of the Pennsylvania sightings appeared to involve the same object, described as bright silver and elliptical, the size of three bus es in length. On the night of August 12-13, the reports from Arkansas, Louisia na, and Kentucky described a large cloud-like ball of fire. In Clark County, Kentucky, the appearance of an enormous ball of fire that lit up the whole sky was accompanied by a sonic boom that made houses shake, along with an odor described as similar to gunpowder. From Illinois, I ndiana, Michigan, and Ontario came a flood of reports about \"a spiral clo ud with a star-like object beside it.\" An air traffic controller, Tim J ones, saw it both visually and on his radar screen, and stated that the way it was behaving was unlike any aircraft he had ever seen. On the same night in Leongatha, Victoria Province, Australia, an English teacher and a scien ce teacher at the local high school reported that a UFO with flashing light s had hovered and maneuvered above them for about forty minutes. On the following day, the scramble for explanations began. Both NASA and NORAD* denied any involvement in the pheno mena, and fur- ther specified that it did not correspond with any known Soviet space activity. Speculation that a new Japanese satellite might have exploded was squelched by a statement from Japan's Tanageshi ma Space Center that their satellite was functioning normally. At this point, as it usually does whenever a UFO in cident occurs that is difficult to explain away in conventional terms, th e U.S. government brought NASA expert (or establishment hatchet man, according to your point of view) James Oberg into the controversy to make a statement. Mr. Oberg stated authoritatively that what everyone had seen was fuel being dumped from a rocket on the Japanese satellite, as the rocket boosted the satellite into orbit, and that was that. Although t his explanation left many questions unanswered (in particular, concerning the incidents in Clark County, Kentucky, and Syracuse, New York), it was a ccepted tamely without protest by the entire news media of this gr eat nation as the final solution to the mystery of the night. A lady named Lorraine Whitaker in Lanesboro, Pennsy lvania, got a clear photograph of what had been visible in the sk y over her area on the night of August 12, which depicts a sharply defined , intensely bright cigar shape, emitting a swirling cloud of luminous gas. Paul Oles, who is the Planetarium Director at the B uhl Science Center in Pittsburgh, made the following statement: \"We kn ow what it wasn't, * North American Air Defense Command"},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"The Suppression of UFO Technologies and Extraterres trial Contact 321 but we have no idea what it was. Our most logical e xplanations have been totally ruled out. It now falls into the category o f an unidentified sight- ing.\" However, only one newspaper even mentioned th e statement by Mr. Oles. Every other newspaper nationwide that carried the story featured the statement by Mr. Oberg of NASA as definitive. On the night of August 15, 1986, three days after t he incidents I have just described, Angelo and Grazia Ricci of Verona, Italy, were abducted while on a summer vacation camping trip near Bellun o, Italy. They were taken aboard a UFO by two humanoids, each about six feet, six inches tall, who were dressed in gray coveralls that left only t heir heads exposed. Their heads were long and hairless and had very pale skin . Their eyes were phos- phorescent. They had pointed ears, a normal nose, a nd a narrow slit where the mouth should be. Mr. and Mrs. Ricci were subjec ted to medical exam- inations and various tests for about three hours be fore being released. A series of events comparable in importance to thos e of August 12 occurred on September 23, 1986. They began at daybr eak, when two brothers fishing on a lake near Daventry, England, reported that shortly after dawn they had seen six UFOs flying in formati on behind a large UFO. Within the next few hours, thousands of people (including police) reported UFOs flying in formation and performing ma neuvers, during which they left behind multi-colored vapor trails o ver West Germany, Holland, Belgium, Luxembourg, and France. In Paris, whole crowds of people driving to work during the morning rush witn essed a fleet of fif- teen UFOs flying in formation. Simultaneously a bal l of fire was seen over Amsterdam; what was described as a \"flying mac hine\" was reported by a staff member of the Royal Observatory in Belgi um; \"a very luminous object shaped like a rocket, three times as large a s an airplane\" as well as \"a cluster of five or six luminous green objects\" w ere reported from Luxembourg; and \"a bright flying object with a lumi nous tail\" was report- ed from West Germany. There were also similar repor ts from Derbyshire and Leicestershire in England. The fifteen UFOs seen over the Montreuil region of Paris were described as silver-colored, but over the Chatelet region of Paris witness- es perceived them as intensely luminous green and t urquoise blue, some of them emitting green flame. Over Paris they were traveling at a leisure- ly pace, about the speed of an airplane during an a ir show. The nearly simultaneous occurrence of such phenomen a over six of the nations of Western Europe on the morning of Septemb er 23, 1986, has all the characteristics of a carefully orchestrated and del iberately ostentatious dis- play, obviously intended to bring about widespread recognition of the reali- ty represented by UFOs among the intelligent citize ns of these key countries. What was the result?"},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"322 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries It is hard to know whether to laugh or cry over the incorrigible hypocrisy with which the news media handled this story. How d id the journalists deal with this unprecedented manifestation of high stran geness in the skies of Europe? They understandably requested an explanatio n from NORAD. However, when NORAD explained that what everyone ha d seen was debris from a Soviet booster rocket, an explanation that w as directly contradicted by the observations the journalists had themselves recorded, this implausible explanation was instantly and uncritically accepted by the news media, which abdicated all pretense of independent reasoni ng and parroted it ad nauseam as the only rational solution to the enigma of what had happened that morning throughout six nations of Western Euro pe. The next example of a deliberate and ostentatious U FO display did not occur over a heavily populated area, but northeaste rn Alaska is certainly a sensitive military zone. The report did not reach t he U.S. news media until January 1, 1987, though the incident happened on No vember 17, 1986. The time lag between the date of the incident and t he date the report was made public supports the hypothesis of covert censo rship of the news media. This case bears a remarkable resemblance to the cas e officially an- nounced by the Soviet Academy of Sciences in 1985, in which a Soviet airliner was followed by a UFO for approximately 80 0 miles. The case of November 17, 1986, involved the pilot, co-pilot, and flight engineer of a Japan Air Lines cargo jet that was ma king a return trip from Iceland to Anchorage, Alaska. The crew members firs t became aware of the three UFOs in the vicinity of their jet while o ver northeastern Alaska. Two of the UFOs were small, but the third was enorm ous, twice the size of an aircraft carrier. The UFOs followed the cargo jet for about 400 miles, during nearly an hour. They emitted flashing amber, green, and yellow lights. They played games with the jet: disappearin g, reappearing, moving at incredible speeds, and hovering. At one point, t he two smaller UFOs maintained positions directly in front of the cockp it of the cargo jet at close range, pacing the jet for several minutes at a distance of only a few feet in front of the cockpit, although the jet was traveling at 570 miles per hour at the time. The large object appeared on the radar screens of F ederal Aviation Administration flight controllers, who gave the Jap an Air Lines pilot per- mission to attempt evasive action. Veteran pilot Ca ptain Terauchi carried out evasive maneuvers, but was not able to shake of f his pursuers. The UFOs later abandoned the pursuit of their own accor d, without having taken any hostile action. FAA officials interviewed the crew members upon the ir arrival at Anchorage and issued a statement saying that the cr ew was \"normal, pro- fessional, rational, and had no drug or alcohol inv olvement.\""},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"Suppression of UFO Technologies and Extraterrestria l Contact 323 At first the FAA confirmed the sighting, then a few days later decided that one air traffic controller had mistakenly inte rpreted a split image of the cargo plane as a separate object. Establishment hatchet man Phil Klass was then called in to kill the story by announcing that Captain Terauchi, despite twenty-nine years of experience as a pilot and a hitherto impecca- ble record, had mistaken the planet Jupiter for a U FO. The fact that the large UFO had been witnessed not only visually by a ll crew members, but also on the jet's radar screen, and that neither Ju piter nor any other planet appears on radar screens, was ignored by Philip Kla ss. Hal Bernton, a reporter for the Daily News of Anchorage, Alaska, c onducted an interview with the air traffic controller in question, Sam Ri ch, which was printed on January 9, 1987. Sam Rich's testimony contradicted the FAA's version of the event in several important ways. Rich, who has worked with the FAA for over a decade , denied cate- gorically that he was the only air traffic controll er to have seen the radar track of the UFO. The two other controllers who wer e working that shift also saw it. The track was not very strong, but nei ther he nor his two col- leagues thought that it could be a split image, a p ossiblity they consider- ed at the time. Right after spotting the track, Ric h phoned the Military Regional Operations Control Center, and \"they infor med me that they had the same radar track.\" Rich confirmed that double images often occur on th e FAA radar screen but said that the JAL plane was not in the area whe re these split images usually occur. Also, over the past decade there hav e been about half a dozen reports by pilots of unidentified lights in t he region where the JAL plane sighted the UFOs. To all this, I can now add the fact that there have been several sightings from the area of the JAL encounter since the incide nt took place, report- ed both by airplane pilots and by people on the gro und. So who are we to believe—the air traffic controller who was actually on the job at the time of the incident, or the professional disinformation agents? Another interesting aspect of the Japan Air Lines s tory is that although the incident occurred over Alaska on November 17, 1 986, no U.S. media coverage of it took place until January 1987. When this six-week delay in making the story public was investigated, it turned out that the story never would have been made public at all in the United St ates if a family mem- ber of one of the JAL crew had not leaked the news to journalists in Japan. Once the story had entered the public domain in Jap an, the U.S. authori- ties could no longer pretend that nothing had happe ned. Yet another major development in t h e story of this case, which appar- ently just refuses to die, occured at t h e end of Au gust 1987 when MUFON* researcher T. Scott Crain Jr. revealed (in a n article e n t i t l e d * Mutual UFO Network"},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"324 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries \"New JAL Sighting Information,\" California UFO, vol . 2, no. 3) that there were indications that the images on the radar tapes had been tampered with. The FAA officials in Anchorage, Alaska, had s ent the radar tapes to the main FAA office in Washington, D.C.—but they ha d not sent them directly. The tapes had traveled an indirect route, making an unexplained detour via the FAA Technical Center at Atlantic Cit y, New Jersey. Resear- chers suspect that it was during this brief sojourn at the FAA Technical Center that the images on the tapes were altered. T he Freedom of Information Act request that Mr. Crain sent to the FAA Technical Center was answered evasively. So once again, the story of the way this case has b een handled by the authorities provides a detailed demonstration of ho w the covert censor- ship enforces the UFO cover-up. What this prolonged series of deliberate ostentatio us displays appears to add up to is a reinforcement schedule, discreetl y but firmly making the presence of extra-terrestrials undeniably obvious, puncturing the balloon of the big lie that has been foisted on U.S. citize ns and the world for over 40 years, deflating it gradually in a manner that i s calculated to oblige public recognition while avoiding public panic. Another important case that just refuses to die is that of the \"West- chester Wing,\" which was described in the Appendix of my previous book and which continues to be persistently reported. A major incident occurred on March 17, 1988, when hundreds of reports came in from northern New Jersey, New York City, and up the Hudson River Vall ey past Ossining to Mahopac, New York. As usual, the same old implausib le explanation was spewed forth by the authorities: pranksters in ultr alight aircraft. Attempts have been made, presumably by the authorities, to b olster the acceptabil- ity of this nonsense by sending up a fleet of ultra lights now and then to imitate the Westchester Wing, but the imitations ar e so obviously differ- ent from the genuine sightings that this desperate ploy has been a com- plete flop. Scientists at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasa dena, California, who examined a videotape of the Westchester Wing made i n 1984, gave their \"unofficial\" opinion in the form of a letter that t he lights are on a single, solid object—thereby ruling out formations of ultra light aircraft. They would not, of course, go on record with an official opinion, being employ- ees of the same authorities who continue to maintai n, despite overwhelm- ing evidence to the contrary, that what huge number s of people in greater New York have been seeing for the last ten years is pranksters in ultralight aircraft. This unprecedented series of sightings ov er the same area, the first of which took place on December 31, 1982, rem ains ongoing. According to UFO researcher Rosemary Decker:"},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"The Suppression of UFO Technologies and Extraterres trial Contact 325 In pointing out that the vast majority of contempor ary humanity feels threatened or terrified by any unprecedented diverg ence from conven- tionally accepted norms of reality, you are present ing a powerful argu- ment in favor of governmental silence and media low -profiling. In view of the fact that government agencies are already ac utely aware of the fear problem, we should be willing to see that some degree of reserve and silence is appropriate. There is no good reason why everyone should be entitled to know all there is to know on an immediate and widespread scale, as most of the population could n ot handle it, though it would be unwise to try to tell them so directly. The behavior patterns of our visitors indicate that they also must be aware of the dangers of sudden wide-spread publicit y concerning their presence. Otherwise why would they consistently man ifest in waves within specfic limited areas for specific periods o f time, build gradually to peaks, and then withdraw from these areas for lo ng periods? Discriminating reserve and caution on the part of o fficialdom are appropriate. However, blatant lying, deceit, and si lencing of witnesses by ridicule or personal threats are deplorable. Suc h tactics are under- mining both national and international security. Th e population of the entire world has by now received absurd explanation s and outright lies from their respective governments for so many years that distrust of governments has reached epidemic proportions on a g lobal scale. If, during the 1940s or early 1950s, the official a gencies had agreed among themselves on a policy of gradual and cautiou s, but honest pres- entation of the facts known to them, with the humil ity to be able to say 'We don't know' at times, the situation would not h ave gotten so com- pletely out of hand, as it now is. Ever since 1947, officialdom has suf- fered from disagreements between agencies, between individuals with- in a given agency, and from differences in directio n as key UFO policy personnel were toppled from office and replaced. Pa rt of the problem of inconsistency in policy has been due to varying deg rees of fear of pub- lic reaction, but is also due to the individual fea rs of those in office, as office-holders. What government wants to admit that it does not kno w everything? Researchers who have been studying this subject ful l-time for as long as forty years admit that they don't know everythin g about it, and that there are frequently extreme differences of opinion between even the best informed of the experts. What government wants its citizens to begin to thin k of themselves as citizens of the planet rather than as French, Ru ssian, American, etc.? To give their allegiance primarily to the planet an d only secondarily to the nation to which they belong? With every year th at passes, many more millions of people all over the world are beco ming aware that we Earth-folk are being visited from elsewhere, irresp ective of our national borders."},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"326 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries With sightings and abductions having escalated to u nprecedented and ever-increasing levels, the situation is now comple tely out of control. The lid of secrecy imposed on the subject by the govern ment for over 40 years is about to blow, no matter how desperately the gov ernment may attempt to continue to stonewall the high strangeness. The most effective way to avoid a sudden explosion, traumatic for all concern ed, is to decrease the pressure by releasing as much information as possib le in forms that the public can assimilate without being excessively tra umatized, such as through this and other books and unbiased media cov erage, so that there is no longer such a gross disparity between what th e public has been con- ditioned to believe and what is actually going on. A major development in the release of previously se cret information has been the publication of the briefing papers for President Eisenhower by William Moore, Stanton Friedman, and Jaime Shand era in the spring of the 1987. There has been considerable debate ove r the authenticity of these documents, which describe the circumstances u nder which President Truman created the top secret Majestic-12 group in order to investigate the national security implications of UFO phenomena . One of the original members of MJ-12 was Admiral Roscoe Hillenkoetter, who was head of the CIA at the time that the incoming Eisenhower ad ministration was installed, and whose signature was appended to one of the controversial documents, dated November 18, 1952. Critics bent on disparaging the authenticity of the documents were dealt a major blow when Dr. Roger W. Westcott annou nced the result of his in-depth study on the basis of stylistic analys is. Dr. Westcott graduat- ed from Princeton Summa Cum Laude and is Director o f the Linguistics Department at Drew University. He has published 40 books in Linquistics, approximately 400 articles, and is considered the m ost eminent authority on this subject in the United States. Dr. Westcott compared the signature on the controversial document with the signatures o n 27 other documents signed by Admiral Hillenkoetter, the authenticity o f which is not in ques- tion, and with 1,200 pages of personal corresponden ce and memo- randa written by Hillenkoetter. Dr. Westcott conclu ded that Admiral Hillenkoetter's signature on the controversial docu ment is authentic. It would seem that such a verdict, combined with th e information con- tent of the document whose authenticity was thus co nfirmed—concerning a crashed UFO and the recovery of four small alien bodies—should be sufficient to deal a final death blow to the credib ility of our government's publicly stated official attitude towards UFOs. How ever, as any psychol- ogist will tell you, deeply entrenched, long held, rigidly assumed, con- ventionally accepted, blind and fanatical belief sy stems do not die easily. They tend to be thick-skinned to the point of being almost impervious to"},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"The Suppression of UFO Technologies and Extraterres trial Contact 327 logic. I stress that \"almost,\" as it is our only ho pe of at last achieving a sane and rational approach to the subject. Edward Mazur made some very relevant remarks about the MJ-12 controversy in the July/August 1989 issue of the Ar kansas MUFON Newsletter: The unauthorized disclosure of a highly classified document is a serious federal crime. The forging of a classified document purported to come from the highest levels of government is perhaps an even more serious crime. Yet in the five years or so since the docume nts surfaced, there have been no arrests or prosecutions by the Departm ent of Justice. Why? According to this writer's logic, the FBI could hav e easily determined, through the issuing agency, whether the document wa s authentic or forged. If it was a forgery, there wouldn't be grea t difficulty in finding the forger, prosecuting him, and setting an example. This action would also discredit and ridicule the g ullible UFO com- munity who had 'bought' MJ-12. Why didn't the FBI t ake advantage of this opportunity if the document was phony? Or wasn 't it? But if the document was genuine, what would the gov ernment gain by apprehending its leaker? Prosecution would be a public admission that MJ-12 was authentic and would reveal the very fact that the docu- ment's high and sensitive classification was design ed to suppress. It would be far better to treat the matter with benign neglect, as is the case now, and to work behind the scenes to thwart any pr ogress the might be made by UFO researchers, while undermining their ac tivity wherever possible. The fact that there have been no indications of any investigations, arrests, or prosecutions in the past five years in the matter of these doc- uments is of great significance. According to the Nevada Aerial Research Newsletter, P.O. Box 81407, Las Vegas, NV 89180, the black-uniformed elite Delt a Special Forces, which carry out their missions in black unmarked helicopt ers and which act as security for the U.S. government alien-related proj ects, are selected almost exclusively from soldiers who grew up as orp hans or have no close family ties. Is this because the enemy they are trained to fight is the citizens of the United States? And we are paying for this with our own tax dollars? The publication of the U.S. edition of Above Top Se cret by British researcher Timothy Good (Morrow, 1988) was a landma rk event that from here on out puts the critics who persist in denying the reality of UFO phe- nomena on the defensive. Timothy Good employs a sim ilar technique to that of Barry Greenwood and Lawrence Fawcett in the ir Clear Intent (Prentice-Hall, 1984), using contradictions within government documents"},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"328 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries to demonstrate that the government is perpetrating a cover-up. However, Clear Intent was focused mainly on the devious acti vities of the intelli- gence community within the United States. The scope of Above Top Secret is world-wide. Timothy Good also deals with the Uni ted States, bringing up much material that was not included in Clear Int ent, but the main thrust of his book is a meticulously detailed investigatio n of what went on con- cerning UFOs within the intelligence communities an d officialdom of England, Canada, Australia, Russia, China, France, Italy, Portugal, and Spain. It is particularly illuminating to compare t he information contained in the Above Top Secret with information contained in Clear Intent, as they supplement each other in remarkable fashion, and th e correlations provide powerful confirmation of their basic hypotheses. Bo th books are focused primarily on unidentified flying objects as aircraf t, dealing only margin- ally with the subject of UFO occupants, which is of course the subject that my own books have been devoted to investigating. Th e publication of Clear Intent put the cynics who maintain that UFO s ightings are all expli- cable in terms of weather balloons, the planet Venu s, swamp gas, mass hysteria, or flocks of geese in a difficult positio n. The publication of the worldwide evidence presented with such concise, con servatively under- stated, devastating effectiveness in Above Top Secr et put these same cyn- ics in an impossible situation, from which there is no way they can recov- er their lost credibility. Let us now turn our attention to the aborted attemp t to bring the subject of UFOs to the attention of the United Nations. A highly important figure in this series of events was Major Colman Von Keviczky, whose background was summarized in th e following terms by his colleague and long-time research associate, J. Antonion Hunccus, in the New York City Tribune of May 19, 1988: Von Keviczky received his Master of Military Scienc e and Engineering (MMSE) at the historical Ludovica University in Bud apest. As a Captain and then Major with the Royal Hungarian Army, he cr eated the Audio- Visual Department of the Hungarian General Staff be fore World War II. After the war he worked for the U.S. occupation for ces in Germany and emigrated to the United States in 1952, the year hi s interest in UFOs began. Von Keviczky is a member of the American Ins titute of Aeronautics & Astronautics (AIAA) and his biography appears in Who's Who in Aviation & Aerospace. In the mid-60s, Von Keviczky worked with the United Nations staff audio-visual department, where he became involved i n a controversy over UFOs and the UN. In 1966, Von Keviczky was actually commissioned by Secretary General U Thant to work on a preliminary memo on how the UFO problem could be inserted in the UN agenda. How ever, the Major found he no longer had a job at the UN after he lea ked news of this"},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"The Suppression of UFO Technologies and Extraterres trial Contact 329 assignment to the press. Yet U Thant confided aroun d that time that \"he considers UFOs the most important problem facing th e UN next to the war in Vietnam,' as reported in Drew Pearson's syndicat ed column. While Von Keviczky was employed as a staff member o f the United Nations Secretariat's Office of Public Information, the UFO wave of 1952 over Washington, D.C., occurred. Being an expert in photography, Von Keviczky realized that the photographs were genuine , and became inter- ested in the subject. Private discussions with dipl omats, scientists, and old friends who were still military officers convinced him of the subject's importance. In 1966, he undertook the initiative th at destroyed his career, which will now be described in his own words: In February 1966, after a long-scrutinized military study of the UFOs' global operation, as Staff Member of the United Nat ions Secretariat, I addressed THE FIRST UFO MEMORANDUM to my Secretary General U Thant. Seizing on his constitutional duty regardi ng the endangered international security, Thant assigned me to elabor ate the FIRST UN- UFO PROJECT. This project referred to: 1. A coordinated cooperation amongst the nations to control the UFOs' global operation and activities. 2. Immediate STOP to any HOSTILE CONFRONTATION, whi ch at any time could trigger a fatal Space War. 3. Seek OFFICIAL CONTACT AND COMMUNICATION with the explor- ing UFO forces, assisted by UNESCO, and by the gove rnments' respective UFO organizations. 4. Declare the 550-mile belt around our Celestial B ody under the PRO- TECTION and JURISDICTION of the United Nations. Thant's common sense and constitutional duty on the alarming worldwide UFO fever is demonstrated by his remark w ithin the diplo- matic corps and his cabinet that: \"UFOS ARE THE MOS T IMPORTANT PROBLEM FACING THE UNITED NATIONS AFTER THE WAR IN VIETNAM.\" The Pentagon and the U.S. diplomacy were immediately alerted to stop him! During the next month, in March, to thwart Thant's UN-UFO Project, the Air Force Scientific Research Board \"AD HOC PAN EL\" was mobi- lized in haste to find a suitable University to stu dy the UFO phenomena. Evidence: CONDON REPORT, preface, pages 7-9 written by the Vice President of the Colorado University. Thant was totally silenced! A \"mysterious\" diplomat ic power constrained him to violate the UN Constitution, and confess also toward the public that his interest in UFOs was only \"pure ly academic and per- sonal.\" According to the Associated Press, Ambassador Trof imirovich"},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"330 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries Fedorenko of the U.S.S.R. comforted him thus: \"UFOs are only the nightmares of the imperialist and capitalist countr ies.\" But against this, on the other side of the token ... \"For my honorarily-accepted UN-UFO Project, I becam e the No. 1 ENEMY OF THE UNITED STATES UFO POLICY. I was awarde d with the notorious SECURITY RISK for scientists! This go vernmental denun- ciation over my lifetime prevented me from having a ny career job at rep- utable firms in the United States....\" United Nations Secretary General U Thant, and the M ember Nations in 1966, were convinced that the Colorado Universit y SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF UFOs had been established to supervise the Pentagon UFO file trustworthiness and credibility, which would l iquidate the media-gen- erated UFO fever. Only three years later, the Report's preface, writt en by the University's vice president Thruston E. Manning, ex posed how he was hoodwinked in 1966, because the Committee was assig ned to study the UFO phenomena \"WHOLLY OUTSIDE THE JURISDICTION OF T HE AIR FORCE.\" Namely, \"outside the jurisdiction\" mean t the scientific study of the hundreds of UFO weekend clubs and news clipping collec- tor hobbyists, thereby discrediting the respected N ICAP* and APRO valuable public research. Evidence: On February 20, 1967, before the Committee started, the CIA gave Dr. Edward U. Condon, Committee Director, the neces sary guideline and instruction. THE MEETING WAS SECRET. No comment s on the masterly delusion and deception of the nations! Well, in UFO research all roads lead to the USA's R ome—as we have learned—THE OMNISCIENT AND OMNIPOTENT C! I! A! The climax of the struggle over whether or not the subject of UFOs should be placed on the agenda of the United Nation s will now be briefly described. It is a matter of historic record that Dr. J. Allen Hynek and Dr. Jacques Vallee prevented Von Keviczky from presenting his e vidence that UFOs are space-craft of extra-terrestrial origin before the Special Political Com- mittee of the United Nations, by threatening to boy cott the Committee if Von Keviczky was allowed to testify. The other thre e experts were Dr. David Saunders, Dr. Claude Poher, and astronaut Gor don Cooper. Only Gordon Cooper, who held the rank of Colonel in the U.S. Air Force and was therefore under obligation to obey orders, supp orted Hynek and Vallee on this issue. Due to the pressure that Hyne k and Vallee exerted, Von Keviczky's invitation to testify was canceled. In documents concerning the Robertson Panel that wa s convened by the CIA in 1953 to deal with the subject of UFOs, D r. Hynek was listed not only as an Air Force Project Bluebook consultan t, but also as an \"OSI\" * National Investigations Committee on Aerial Pheno mena"},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"The Suppression of UFO Technologies and Extraterres trial Contact 331 consultant. \"OSI\" is an abbreviation for the Office of Scientific Intel- ligence, which is a sub-section of the CIA. Accordi ng to a public state- ment made by Dr. Hynek, he was not invited to atten d all the sessions of the Robertson Panel. However, this statement is con tradicted by an offi- cial document dated January 27, 1953, and declassif ied in 1977, which stated that Hynek \"sat in on all the sessions after the first day,\" but did not sign the report as an official group member. Hynek was already an OSI consultant before he became a consultant to Project Bluebook. Did he remain an OSI consultant for the rest of his life? Was he assigned to play the part of the maverick scientist in revolt agains t the authorities, when the authorities realized the explanations, such as \"swa mp gas\" were no longer credible, in order to more effectively acquire info rmation from and con- trol over the genuinely independent researchers? Jacques Vallee began his UFO research career in the 1960s as the assis- tant of Dr. Hynek. Considering this in combination with the result of his close collaboration with Dr. Hynek at the United Na tions, is Dr. Vallee also an OSI consultant? On November 27, 1978, Dr. Vallee stated to the Spec ial Political Committee of the United Nations, which had been con vened to decide whether or not to place the subject of UFOs on the UN agenda, that: \"although the UFO phenomenon is real and appears to be caused by an unknown physical stimulus, I have so far failed to discover any evidence that it represents the arrival of visitors from out er space.\" Having said that, he skipped briefly over the physical manifest ations of the phenome- non, saying only they should be studied. He then st ressed the importance of studying the psychophysiological effects on witn esses, carefully point- ing out that: \"I do not believe it is within the pr ovince or the budget of the United Nations to address such effects directly . . .\" He continued by insisting at length on the importance of studying t he social belief systems generated by the phenomenon, as well as the emotion al factors in- volved—aspects of the phenomenon so clearly outside the province and budget of the United Nations that it was not necess ary for him to repeat this a second time. Thus with a few deft strokes, h e effectively sabotaged the placing of the subject of the UFO phenomenon on the agenda of the United Nations, which was exactly what the CIA want ed to prevent. If Von Keviczky had been allowed to present his eviden ce, there is a strong probability that the Committee would have decided t o place the subject on the UN agenda, after which the cover-up would have been impossible to maintain. I salute the example set by Major Colman Von Kevicz ky, as I consid- er him a genuine modern hero. The fo u r propositions he suggested to Secretary General U Thant should be implemented by the United Nations"},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"332 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries without further delay, since they are as valid now as they were in 1966. In my opinion, the close encounter and abduction ca ses constitute the spearhead of UFO research. Of course, it is essenti al to distinguish between genuine and fraudulent cases, and this is n ot always easy to do. However, with patient, open-minded, persistent, and alert attention, it can be done. The analogy of sorting out batches of gems tone rough is relevant here. There are ways of detecting whether one is in the presence of the real thing or an imitation. The genuine contact and abduction cases are the int erface between ter- restrial humanity and the UFO phenomenon. There are literally thousands of such case histories on record, and perhaps tens or hundreds of thou- sands, or more, which have not been reported. I wou ld suggest that about two-thirds of the hypothetical budget be allocated to investigating as thor- oughly as possible the thousands of case histories already on record: eval- uating them for authenticity, conducting follow-up interviews and hyp- notic regression sessions when appropriate, and fee ding all the informa- tion obtained into computers. The data bank derived from the review of contact an d abduction cases should then be correlated with the data bank derive d from the lights-in- the-sky and physical nuts-and-bolts manifestations. If project funds are still available after this pro cedure has been com- pleted, we should start interviewing the oceanic mu ltitude of contactees and abductees whose stories have only recently begu n to surface and are not yet on record. These interviews would be conduc ted and tabulated along the same lines as those case histories alread y on record. From these myriad correlations, certain major patte rns should emerge. What I would consider to be of prime importance wou ld be the patterns indicating the characteristics of the different typ es of extra-terrestrial and/or inter-dimensional humanoids, human-appearing beings, and ex- tremely dissimilar alien entities involved in these manifestations, to which we have been applying the catch-all UFO label. The information derived from such profiles would include not only the physi cal characteristics and types of craft most frequently used, but also the b ehavioral characteristics. Typical ways of interacting with us would contain c lues as to motivations for making contact with us, as well as to psycholog ical traits and the extent to which communication may be possible. Such questions as supe- riority, inferiority, or equality of intelligence b etween them and us would be explored, as well as unusual aspects of their in telligence. Indications of the relative benevolence, malevolence, or neutralit y of the various types would show up clearly in such profiles, as well as of their friendliness or hostility to each other. As abductee Ida Kannenberg has so perceptively pointed out: \"There are so many different types of extra terrestrials that it"},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"The Suppression of UFO Technologies and Extraterres trial Contact 333 is not possible to make statements that are valid f or all of them. Many types are as alien to each other as they are to us. \" By establishing reliable profiles of the different types most persistent- ly reported, we would at least know what we are dea ling with and be in a far better position to communicate meaningfully. If there was a war in heaven that is still going on , in which who we give our allegiance to may be a matter of importance, th ough Earth may be no more than a single sector of a multi-galactic battl e zone, at least we would be able to make an informed choice concerning which group we enter an alliance with. That would certainly be preferable t o making a decision of such importance in our present state of blind ignor ance. If, on the other hand, peace and harmony reign supr eme over the inhab- itants of outer space, and it is we humans who must learn to transcend our aggressive bellicose natures in order to become eli gible for galactic citi- zenship, we still need to know who we are dealing w ith, and be able to communicate with them. Those who are still arguing about whether or not UF Os are real will continue to do so, until obliged to face the facts with their own eyes. For those of us who are already aware that UFOs are rea l, the question becomes: What types of beings are piloting them, an d what is their moti- vation for keeping us under surveillance and clande stinely interacting with us? It is a matter of extreme urgency that an all-out e ffort be made to find out as much as possible about the different types o f non-human intelligent life-forms at present hovering above us and among u s. We can no longer continue to pretend that we are dealing with miside ntifications of weath- er balloons, the planet Venus, flocks of geese, or swamp gas, and retain our position as the dominant life-form on planet Ea rth. It is time to face the fact that outer space is inhabited, and that ev er since we exploded the first atomic bombs its inhabitants have been watchi ng us very closely. It is obvious that in comparison to a number of alread y existing alien civi- lizations, our space technology is in the kindergar ten stage. We must establish open alliance with the groups we can work out mutually benefi- cial relationships with, and take appropriate measu res to defend ourselves against the predatory activities of the groups who have come here to exploit us. It is imperative that we learn to disti nguish between extra-ter- restrial friends and foes. What is at stake is our survival, not only as indi- viduals, but as a freely evolving species."},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"UFOs and the U.S. Air Force PART I Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) What is an Unidentified Flying Object (UFO)? Well, according to United States Air Force Regulati on 80-17 (dated 19 September 1966), a UFO is \"any aerial phenomenon or object which is unknown or appears to be out of the ordinary to the observer.\" This is a very broad definition which applies equal ly well to one indi- vidual seeing his first noctilucent [luminous] clou d at twilight as it does to another individual seeing his first helicopter. However, at present most people consider the term UFO to mean an object whic h behaves in a strange or erratic manner while moving through the Earth's atmosphere. That strange phenomenon has evoked strong emotions and great curiosi- ty among a large segment of our world's population. The average person is interested because he loves a mystery, the profe ssional military man is involved because of the possible threat to national security, and some sci- entists are interested because of the basic curiosi ty that led them into becoming researchers. The literature on UFOs is so vast, and the stories so many and varied, that we can only present a sketchy outline of the s ubject in this chapter. That outline includes description classifications, operational domains (temporal and spatial), some theories as to the nat ure of the UFO phe- nomenon, human reactions, attempts to attack the pr oblem scientifically, and some tentative conclusions. 33.1—Descriptions One of the greatest problems you encounter when att empting to catalog UFO sightings, is selection of a system for catalog ing.

The net result is that almost all UF O data are either treat- ed in the form of individual cases, or in the forms of inadequate qualifi- cation systems. However, these systems do tend to h ave some common factors, and a collection of these factors is as fo llows: [a] Size; [b] Shape (disc, ellipse, football, etc.) ; [c] Luminosity; [d] Color; [e] Number of UFOs. Behavior: [a] Location (altitude, direction, etc.); [b] Patterns of paths (straight line, climbing, zig-zagging, etc.); [c] F light characteristics (wob- bling, fluttering, etc.); [d] Periodicity of sighti ngs; [e] Time duration; [f] Curiosity or inquisitiveness; [g] Avoidance; [h] Ho stility. Associated Effects: [a] Electro-magnetic (compass, radio, igni- tion systems, etc.); [b] Radiation (burns, induced radioactivity, etc.); [c] Ground disturbance (dust stirred up, leaves moved, standing wave peaks of surface of water, etc.); [d] Sound (none, hissin g, humming, roaring, thunderclaps, etc.); [e] Vibration (weak, strong, s low, fast); [f] Smell (ozone or other odor); [g] Flame (how much, where, when, color); [h] Smoke or cloud (amount, color, persistence); [I] De bris (type, amount, color, persistence); [j] Inhibition of voluntary mo vement by observers; [k] Sighting of \"creatures\" or \"beings.\" After Effects: [a] Burned areas or animals; [b] Dep ressed or flat- tened areas; [c] Dead or \"missing\" animals; [d] Men tally disturbed peo- ple; [e] Missing items. We make no attempt here to present available data i n terms of the fore- going descriptors. 33.2—Operational Domains—Temporal and Spatial What we will do here is to present evidence that UF Os are a global phe- nomenon which may have persisted for many thousands of years. During this discussion, please remember that the more anci ent the reports the less sophisticated the observer. Not only were the ancie nt observers lacking the terminology necessary to describe complex devic es (such as present clay helicopters) but they were also lacking the co ncepts necessary to understand the true nature of such things as televi sion, spaceships, rock- ets, nuclear weapons and radiation effects. To some , the most advanced technological concept was a war chariot with knife blades attached to the wheels.

Nevertheless, let us start with an intriguing story in one of the oldest chronicles of India—the Book of Dzyan. The book is a group of \"story-teller\" legends which were finally gath- ered in manuscript form when man learned to write. One of the stories is of a small group of beings who supposedly came to E arth many thousands of years ago in a metal craft which orbited the Ear th several times before landing. As told in the Book: These beings lived on Earth while largely keeping t o themselves and were revered by the humans among whom they had sett led. But even- tually differences arose among them and they divide d their numbers, several of the men and women and some children sett led in another city, where they were promptly installed as rulers by the awe-stricken populace. Separation did not bring peace to these people and finally their anger reached a point where the ruler of the original cit y took with him a small number of his warriors and they rose into the air i n a huge shining metal vessel. While they were many leagues from the city of their enemies, they launched a great shining lance that rode on a beam of light. It burst apart in the city of their enemies with a great bal l of flame that shot up to the heavens, almost to the stars. All those who were in the city were horribly burned and even those who were not in the city—but nearby— were burned also. Those who looked upon the lance a nd the ball of fire were blinded forever afterward. Those who entered t he city on foot became ill and died. Even the dust of the city was poisoned, as were the rivers that flowed through it. Men dared not go nea r it, and it gradually crumbled into dust and was forgotten by men. When the leader saw what he had done to his own peo ple he retired to his palace and refused to see anyone. Then he ga thered about him those warriors who remained, and their wives and ch ildren, and they entered their vessels and rose one by one into the sky and sailed away. Nor did they return. Could this foregoing legend really be an account of an extraterrestrial col- onization, complete with guided missile, nuclear wa rhead and radiation effects? It is difficult to assess the validity of that explanation—just as it is difficult to explain why Greek, Roman and Nordic My thology all discuss wars and conflicts among their \"Gods.\" (Even the Bi ble records conflict between the legions of God and Satan.) Could it be that each group record- ed their parochial view of what was actually a glob al conflict among alien colonists or visitors? Or is it that man has led su ch a violent existence that he tends to expect conflict and violence among even his gods?

These carvings have been evaluated a s 47,000 years old, and they show people with large trunks (breathing a pparatus?) or \"ele- phant\" heads shown on human bodies. (Remember, the Egyptians often represented their gods as animal heads on human bod ies.) Only 8,000 years ago, rocks were sculpted in the Tassili plate au of Sahara, depicting what appeared to be human beings but with strange r ound heads (helmets? or \"sun\" heads on human bodies?) And even more rece ntly, in the Bible, Genesis 6:4 tells of angels from the sky mating wit h women of Earth, who bore them children. Genesis 19:3 tells of Lot meeti ng two angels in the desert and his later feeding them at his house. The Bible also tells a rather unusual story of Ezekiel who witnessed what has bee n interpreted by some to have been a spacecraft or aircraft landing near the Chebar River in Chaldea* (593 B.C.). Even the Irish have recorded strange visitations. I n the Speculum Regali in Konungs Skuggsa (and other accounts of th e era about 956 A . D .) are numerous stories of \"demonships\" in the skies. In one case a rope from one such ship became entangled with part of a churc h. A man from the ship climbed down the rope to free it, but was seiz ed by the townspeople. The bishop made the people release the man, who cli mbed back to the ship, where the crew cut the rope and the ship rose and sailed out of sight. In all of his actions, the climbing man appeared as if he were swimming in water. Stories such as this makes one wonder if the legends of the \"lit- tle people\" of Ireland were based upon imagination alone. About the same time, in Lyons, France, three men an d a woman sup- posedly descended from an airship or spaceship and were captured by a mob. These foreigners admitted to being wizards, an d were killed. (No mention is made of the methods employed to extract the admissions.) Many documented UFO sightings occurred throughout t he Middle Ages, including an especially startling one of a UFO over London on 16 December 1742. However, we do not have room to include any m ore of the Middle Ages sightings. Instead, two \"more recent\" sighting s are contained in this section to bring us up to modern times. In a sworn statement dated 21 April 1897, a prosper ous and promi- nent farmer named Alexander Hamilton (Lea Roy, Kans as) told of an attack upon his cattle at about 10:30 P . M . the previous Monday. He, his son, and his tenant grabbed axes and ran some 700 f eet from the house to the cow lot where a great cigar-shaped ship abou t 300 feet long float- ed some 30 feet above his cattle. It had a carriage underneath which was brightly lighted within (dirigible and gondola?) an d which had numer- ous windows. Inside were six s t r a n g e - looking beings jabbering in a for- * An ancient region of Mesopotamia."},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":"338 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries eign language. These beings suddenly became aware o f Hamilton and the others. They immediately turned a searchlight o n the farmer, and also turned on some power which sped up a turbine w heel (about 30 feet in diameter) located under the craft. The ship rose , taking with it a two- year-old heifer which was roped about the neck by a cable of one-half inch thick, red material. The next day a neighbor, Link Thomas, found the animal's hide, legs and head in his field. He w as mystified at how the remains got to where they were because of the l ack of tracks in the soft soil. Alexander Hamilton's sworn statement was accompanied by an affidavit as to his veracity. The affidavit was sig ned by ten of the local leading citizens. On the evening of 4 November 1957 at Fort Itaipu, B razil, two sentries noted a \"new star\" in the sky. The \"star\" grew in s ize and within seconds stopped over the fort. It drifted slowly downward, was as large as a big aircraft, and was surrounded by a strong orange glo w. A distinct humming sound was heard, and then the heat struck. A sentry collapsed almost immediately, the other managed to slide to shelter under the heavy can- nons where his loud cries awoke the garrison. While the troops were scrambling towards their battle stations, complete electrical failure occurred. There was panic until the lights came bac k on but a number of men still managed to see an orange glow leaving the area at high speed. Both sentries were found badly burned—one unconscio us and the other incoherent, suffering from deep shock. Thus, UFO sightings not only appear to extend back to 47,000 years through time but also are global in nature. One has the feeling that this phenomenon deserves some sort of valid scientific i nvestigation, even if it is a low level effort. 33.3—Some Theories as to the Nature of the UFO Phenomenon There are very few cohesive theories as to the natu re of UFOs. Those the- ories that have been advanced can be collected in f ive groups: [a] Mysticism; [b] Hoaxes, and rantings due to unst able personalities; [c] Secret Weapons; [d] Natural Phenomena; [e] Alien vi sitors. [a] Mysticism. It is believed by some cults that th e mission of UFOs and their crews is a spiritual one, and that all ma terialistic efforts to determine the UFOs' natures are doomed to failure. [b] Hoaxes, and Rantings due to Unstable Personalit ies. Some have suggested that all UFO reports were the r esults of pranks and"},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"The Suppression of UFO Technologies and Extraterres trial Contact 339 hoaxes, or were made by people with unstable person alities. This attitude was particularly prevalent during the time period w hen the Air Force inves- tigation was being operated under the code name of Project Grudge. A few airlines even went as far as to ground every pilot who reported seeing a \"fly- ing saucer.\" The only way for the pilot to regain f light status was to under- go a psychiatric examination. There was a noticeabl e decline in pilot reports during this time interval, and a few interpreted th is decline to prove that UFOs were either hoaxes or the result of unstable p ersonalities. It is of in- terest that NICAP (The National Investigations Comm ittee on Aerial Phenomena) even today still receives reports from c ommercial pilots who neglect to notify either the Air Force or their own airline. There are a number of cases which indicate that not all reports fall in the hoax category. We will examine one such case no w. It is the Socorro, New Mexico sighting made by police Sergeant Lonnie Zamora. Sergeant Zamora was patrolling the streets of Socorro on 24 April 1964 when he saw a shiny object drift down into an area of gulli es on the edge of town. He also heard a loud roaring noise which sounded as if an old dynamite shed located out that way had exploded. He immediat ely radioed police headquarters, and drove out toward the shed. Zamora was forced to stop about 150 yards away from a deep gully in which the re appeared to be an overturned car. He radioed that he was investigatin g a possible wreck, and then worked his car up onto the mesa and over towar d the edge of the gully. He parked short, and when he walked the fina l few feet to the edge, he was amazed to see that it was not a car but inst ead was a weird egg- shaped object about fifteen feet long, white in col or and resting on short, metal legs. Beside it, unaware of his presence, wer e two humanoids dressed in silvery coveralls. They seemed to be wor king on a portion of the underside of the object. Zamora was still stand ing there, surprised, when they suddenly noticed him and dove out of sigh t around the object. Zamora also headed the other way, back toward his c ar. He glanced back at the object just as a bright blue flame shot down from the underside. Within seconds the egg-shaped thing rose out of the gully with \"an ear- splitting roar.\" The object was out of sight over t he nearby mountains almost immediately, and Sergeant Zamora was moving the opposite direc- tion almost as fast when he met Sergeant Sam Chavez who was respond- ing to Zamora's earlier radio calls. Together they investigated the gully and found the bushes charred and still smoking wher e the blue flame had jetted down on them. About the charred area were fo ur deep marks where the metal legs had been. Each mark was three and on e half inches deep, and was circular in shape. The sand in the gully wa s very hard packed, so no sign of the humanoids' footprints could be found . An official investi- gation was launched that same day, and all data obt ained supported the"},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":"340 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries stories of Zamora and Chavez. It is rather difficul t to label this episode a hoax, and it is also doubtful that both Zamora and Chavez shared portions of the same hallucination. [c] Secret Weapons. A few individuals have proposed that UFOs are actually advanced weapon systems, and that their na tures must not be revealed. Very few people accept this as a credible suggestion. [d] Natural Phenomena. It has also been suggested t hat at least some, and possibly all of the UFO cases were just m isinterpreted mani- festations of natural phenomena. Undoubtedly this s uggestion has some merit. People have reported, as UFOs, objects which were conclusively proven to be balloons (weather and skyhook), the pl anet Venus, man- made artificial satellites, normal aircraft, unusua l cloud formations, and lights from ceilometers (equipment projecting light beams on cloud bases to determine the height of the aircraft visual ceil ing). It is also suspected that people have reported mirages, optical illusion s, swamp gas and ball lightning (a poorly-understood discharge of electri cal energy in a spher- oidal or ellipsoidal shape . . . some charges have lasted for up to fifteen minutes but the ball is usually no bigger than a la rge orange). But it is dif- ficult to tell a swamp dweller that the strange, fa st-moving light he saw in the sky was swamp gas; and it is just as difficult to tell a farmer that a bright UFO in the sky is the same ball lightning th at he has seen rolling along his fence wires in dry weather. Thus accident al misidentification of what might well be natural phenomena breeds mistrus t and disbelief; it leads to the hasty conclusion that the truth is del iberately not being told. One last suggestion of interest has been made, that the UFOs were plas- moids from space-concentrated blobs of solar wind t hat succeeded in reaching the surface of the Earth. Somehow this las t suggestion does not seem to be very plausible; perhaps because it ignor es such things as pen- etration of Earth's magnetic field. PART II Alien Visitors The most stimulating theory for us is that the UFOs are material objects which are either \"manned\" or remote-controlled by b eings who are alien to this planet. There is some evidence supporting t his viewpoint. In addi- tion to police Sergeant Lonnie Zamora's experience, let us consider the case of Barney and Betty Hill. On a trip through Ne w England they lost two hours on the night of 19 September 1961 without even realizing it. However, after that night both Barney and Betty beg an developing psy- chological problems which eventually grew sufficien tly severe that they"},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":"The Suppression of UFO Technologies and Extraterres trial Contact 341 submitted themselves to psychiatric examination and treatment. During the course of treatment, hypnotherapy was used, and it yielded remarkably detailed and similar stories from both Barney and B etty. Essentially they had been hypnotically kidnapped, taken aboard a UFO , submitted to two- hour physicals, and released with posthypnotic sugg estions to forget the entire incident. The evidence is rather strong that this is what the Hills, even in their subconscious, believe happened to the m. And it is of partic- ular importance that after the \"posthypnotic block\" was removed, both of the Hills ceased having their psychological problem s. The Hill's description of the aliens was similar to descriptions provid- ed in other cases, but this particular type of alie n appears to be in the minority. The most commonly described alien is abou t three and one half feet tall, has a round head (helmet?), arms reachin g to or below his knees, and is wearing a silvery space suit or coveralls. O ther aliens appear to be essentially the same as Earthmen, while still other s have particularly wide (wrap around) eyes and mouths with very thin lips. And there is a rare group reported as about 4 feet tall, weight of arou nd 35 pounds, and cov- ered with thick hair or fur (clothing?). Members of this last group are described as being extremely strong. If such beings are visiting Earth, two questions arise: 1) Why haven't they attempted to c ontact us officially? The answer to the first question may exist partiall y in Sergeant Lonnie Zamora's experience, and may exist partially in the Tunguska meteor.* It was suggested that the Tunguska meteor was actually a comet which exploded in the atmosphere, the ices melted and the dust spread out. Hence, no debris. However, it has also been suggest ed that the Tunguska meteor was actually an alien spacecraft that entere d the atmosphere too rapidly, suffered mechanical failure, and lost its power supply and/or weapons in a nuclear explosion. While that hypothes is may seem far- fetched, sample of tree rings from around the world reveal that, immedi- ately after the Tunguska meteor explosion, the leve l of radioactivity in the world rose sharply for a short period of time. It i s difficult to find a natu- ral explanation for that increase in radioactivity, although the suggestion has been advanced that enough of the meteor's great Kinetic energy was converted into heat (by atmospheric friction) that a fusion reaction oc- curred. This still leaves us with no answer to the second question: Why no contact? That question is very easy to answer in se veral ways: 1) We may be the object of intensive sociological and psychol ogical study. In such studies you usually avoid disturbing the test subje cts' environment; 2) You do not \"contact\" a colony of ants, and humans may s eem that way to any alien s (variation: a zoo is fun to visit, but you d on't \"contact\" the lizards); 3) Such contact may have already t a k e n place secret ly; and 4) Such con- * A massive explosion that occurred in Siberia in 1 908."},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"342 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries tact may have already taken place on a different pl ane of awareness and we are not yet sensitive to communications on such a plane. These are just a few of the reasons. You may add to the list as yo u desire. 33.4—Human Fear and Hostility Besides the foregoing reasons, contacting humans is downright danger- ous. Think about that for a moment! On the microsco pic level our bodies reject and fight (through production of antibodies) any alien material; this process helps us fight off disease but it also some times results in allergic reactions to innocuous materials. On the macroscopi c (psychological and sociological) level we are antagonistic to beings t hat are \"different.\" For proof of that, just watch how an odd child is treat ed by other children, or how a minority group is socially deprived. ... In c ase you are hesitant to extend that concept to the treatment of aliens let me point out that in very ancient times, possible extraterrestrials may have been treated as Gods but in the last 2000 years, the evidence is that any po ssible aliens have been ripped apart by mobs, shot and shot at, physically assaulted, and in gen- eral treated with fear and aggression. In Ireland about 1000 A . D ., supposed airships were treated as \"demon- ships.\" In Lyons, France, \"admitted\" space traveler s were killed. More recently, on 24 July 1957 Russian anti-aircraft bat teries on the Kouril Islands opened fire on UFOs.* Although all Soviet a nti-aircraft batteries on the Islands were in action, no hits were made. T he UFOs were lumi- nous and moved very fast. We, too, have fired on UF Os. About ten o'clock one morning, a radar site near a fighter base picke d up a UFO doing 700 miles per hour. The UFO then slowed to 100 miles pe r hour, and two F-86s scrambled to intercept. Eventually one F-86 c losed on the UFO at about 3000 feet altitude. The UFO began to accelera te away but the pilot still managed to get within 500 yards of the target for a short period of time. It was definitely saucer shaped. As the pilot pushed the F-86 at top speed, the UFO began to pull away. When the range r eached 1000 yards, the pilot armed his guns and fired in an attempt to down the saucer. He failed, and the UFO pulled away rapidly, vanishing in the distance. This same basic situation may have happened on a mo re personal level. On Sunday evening 21 August 1955, eight adults and three children were on the Sutton Farm (one-half mile from Kelly, Kentu cky) when, accord- ing to them, one of the children saw a brightly glo wing UFO settle behind the barn, out of sight from where he stood. Other w itnesses on nearby farms also saw the object. However, the Suttons dis missed it as a \"shoot- ing star,\" and did not investigate. Approximately t hirty minutes later (at 8:00 P . M .), the family dogs began barking, so two of the men we nt to the * The Kouril Islands are located north of Japan."},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":"The Suppression of UFO Technologies and Extraterres trial Contact 343 back door and looked out. Approximately 50 feet awa y and coming toward them was a creature wearing a glowing silver y suit. It was about three-and-one-half feet tall with a large round hea d and very long arms. It had large webbed hands which were equipped with claws. The two Suttons grabbed a twelve gauge shotgun and a .22 ca liber pistol, and fired at close range. They could hear the pellets and bul let ricochet as if off of metal. The creature was knocked down, but jumped up and scrambled away. The Suttons retreated into the house, turned off all inside lights, and turned on the porch light. At that moment, one of t he women who was peeking out of the dining room window discovered th at a creature with some sort of helmet and wide slit eyes was peeking back at her. She screamed, the men rushed in and started shooting. T he creature was knocked backwards but again scrambled away without apparent harm. More shooting occurred (a total of about fifty roun ds) over the next twen- ty minutes and the creatures finally left (perhaps feeling unwelcome?). After about a two hour wait (for safety), the Sutto ns left too. By the time the police got there, the aliens were gone but the Suttons would not move back to the farm. They sold it and departed. This r eported incident does bear out the contention though that aliens are dang erous. At no time in the story did the supposed aliens shoot back, although one is left with the impression that the described creatures were having fun scaring humans. 33.5—Attempts at Scientific Approaches In any scientific endeavor, the first step is to ac quire data, the second step is to classify the data, and the third step is to f orm a hypothesis. This hypothesis is tested by repeating the entire proces s, with each cycle result- ing in an increase in understanding (we hope). The UFO phenomenon does not yield readily to this approach because the data taken so far exhibits both excessive variety and vagueness. The vagueness is caused in part by the lack of preparation of the observer— very few people leave their house knowing that they are going to see a UF O that evening. Photographs are overexposed or underexposed, and ra rely in color. Hardly anyone carries around a radiation counter or magnet ometer. And, in addi- tion to this, there is a very high level of \"noise\" in the data. The noise consists of mistaken reports of known nat ural phenomena, hoaxes, reports by unstable individuals, and mistak en removal of data regarding possible unnatural or unknown natural phe nomena (by overzeal- ous individuals who are trying to eliminate all dat a due to known natural phenomena). In addition, those data, which do appea r to be valid, exhibit an excessive amount of variety relative to the stat istical samples which are available. This has led to very clumsy classificati on systems, which in turn provide quite unfertile ground for formulation of h ypotheses."},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"344 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries One hypothesis which looked promising for a time wa s that of OR- THOTENY (i.e., UFO sightings fall on \"area circle\" routes). At first, plots of sightings seemed to verify the concept of orthot eny but recent use of computers has revealed that even random numbers yie ld \"great circle\" plots as neatly as do UFO sightings. There is one solid advance that has been made thoug h. Jacques and Janine Vallee have taken a particular type of UFO—n amely those that are lower than tree-top level when sighted—and plotted the UFOs' estimated diameters versus the estimated distance from the ob server. The result yields an average diameter of 5 meters with a very characteristic drop for short viewing distances. This behavior at the extre mes of the curve is well known to astronomers and psychologists as the \"moon illusion.\" The illu- sion only occurs when the object being viewed is a real, physical object. Because this implies that the observers have viewed a real object, it per- mits us to accept also their statement that these p articular UFOs had a rotational axis of symmetry. Another, less solid, advance made by the Vallees wa s their plotting of the total number of sightings per week versus the d ate. They did this for the time span from 1947 to 1962, and then attempted to match the peaks of the curve (every 2 years, 2 months) to the times of Earth-Mars con- junction (every 2 years, 1.4 months). The match was very good between 1950 and 1956 but was poor outside those limits. Al so, the peaks were not only at the times of Earth-Mars conjunction but als o roughly at the first harmonic (very loosely, every 13 months). This rais es the question why should UFOs only visit Earth when Mars is in conjun ction and when it is on the opposite side of the sun. Obviously, the con junction periodicity of Mars is not the final answer. As it happens, there is an interesting possi- bility to consider. Suppose Jupiter's conjunctions were used; they are every 13.1 months. That would satisfy the observed periods nicely, except for every even data peak being of different magnitu de from every odd data peak. Perhaps a combination of Martian, Jovian, and Saturnian (and even other planetary) conjunctions will be necessary to match the frequency plot—if it can be matched. Further data correlation is quite difficult. There are a large number of different saucer shapes but this may mean little. F or example, look at the number of different types of aircraft which are in use in the U.S. Air Force alone. It is obvious that intensive scientific study is ne eded in this area; no such study has yet been undertaken at the necessary levels of intensity needed. Something that must be guarded against in a ny such study is the trap of implicitly assuming that our knowledge of p hysics (or any other branch of science) is complete. An example of one s uch trap is selecting"},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"The Suppression of UFO Technologies and Extraterres trial Contact 345 a group of physical laws which we now accept as val id, and assuming that they will never be superseded. Five such laws might be: 1. Every action must have an opposite and equal reacti on. 2. Every particle in the universe attracts every other particle with a force proportional to the product of the masses and inver sely as the square of the distance. 3. Energy, mass and momentum are conserved. 4. No material body can have a speed as great as c, th e speed of light in free space. 5. The maximum energy, E, which can be obtained from a body at rest is E=mc 2 , where m is the rest mass of the body. Laws numbered 1 and 3 seem fairly safe, but let us hesitate and take another look. Actually, law number 3 is only valid (now) from a relativis- tic viewpoint; and for that matter so are laws 4 an d 5. But relativity com- pletely revised these physical concepts after 1915, before then Newtonian mechanics were supreme. We should also note that ge neral relativity has not yet been verified. Thus we have the peculiar si tuation of five laws which appear to deny the possibility of intelligent alien control of UFOs, yet three of the laws are recent in concept and may not even be valid. Also, law number 2 has not yet been tested under conditio ns of large relative speeds or accelerations. We should not deny the pos sibility of alien con- trol of UFOs on the basis of preconceived notions n ot established as relat- ed or relevant to the UFOs. 33.6—Conclusion From available information, the UFO phenomenon appe ars to have been global in nature for almost 50,000 years. The major ity of known witness- es have been reliable people who have seen easily-e xplained natural phe- nomena, and there appears to be no overall positive correlation with pop- ulation density. The entire phenomenon could be psy chological in nature but that is quite doubtful. However, psychological factors probably do enter the data picture as \"noise.\" The phenomenon c ould also be entirely clue to known and unknown phenomena (with some psyc hological noise added in) but that too is questionable in view of s ome of the available data. This leaves us with the unpleasant possibility of a lien visitors to our planet, or at least of alien controlled UFOs.

It implies the existence of intelligent life on a majority of the planets in our solar sys- tem, or a surprisingly strong interest in Earth by members of other solar systems. A solution to the UFO problem may be obtained by th e long and dili- gent effort of a large group of well-financed and c ompetent scientists; unfortunately there is no evidence suggesting that such an effort is going to be made. However, even if such an effort were ma de, there is no guar- antee of success because of the isolated and sporad ic nature of the sight- ings. Also, there may be nothing to find, and that would mean a long search with no profit at the end. The best thing to do is to keep an open and skeptic al mind, and not take an extreme position on any side of the question."},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"UFOs and the CIA: Anatomy of a Cover-Up Reg A. Davidson The modern age of UFO phenomena began on a July aft ernoon in 1947 when private pilot Kenneth Arnold reported nine uni dentifiable silvery, crescent-shaped objects that skimmed through the sk y at an incredible rate of speed. Their motion, Arnold said, reminded him of \"a sauce r skipping over water.\" A news reporter took up Arnold's descriptio n and the phrase \"fly- ing saucers\" soon became imprinted on the collectiv e consciousness. When strange objects continued to be reported by co mpetent witness- es, the U.S. authorities began investigating the ph enomenon. The task fell under the auspices of the United States Air Force, but few were aware that the CIA took an interest in the strange phenomena s oon after the first reports of \"flying saucers\" emerged. The Air Force was actually in a state of near panic due to the wave of sightings. UFOs were reported over Maxwell Air Forc e base in Alabama, (hen, to the horror of the top military brass, over the White Sands Proving Ground—right in the middle of their atom bomb terri tory. General Nathan Twining, commander of the Air Material Command, wro te to the com- manding general of the Army-Air Force stating that the phenomenon was something real, that it was not \"visionary or f ictitious,\" and that the objects were disc-shaped, as large as aircraft, and controlled. The press latched onto the reports and sensationali zed stories of alien invasion gripped the population. The press and the Government were de- manding answers. The Air Force, worried that the wh ole situation was get- ting out of hand, tried to quell public angst by or dering a full investigation. On December 30, 1947, Major General L. C. Craigie o rdered the estab- lishment of Project Sign at what became known as Wr ight-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio. Operating under auspice s of the Air Material Command's Technical Intelligence Division, Project Sign was directed \"to collect, collate, evaluate and distribute to i nterested government agen-"},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"348 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries ties and contractors all information concerning sig htings and phenomena in the atmosphere which can be construed to be of c oncern to the nation- al security.\" The project was given a 2A restricted classificatio n security rating under a system that acknowledged 1A as the highest, or mo st secret, designation. The following year, three men from Wright-Patterson approached Dr. J. Allen Hynek, an astronomer then employed by Ohio St ate University in nearby Columbus. \"They said they needed some astron omical consulta- tion because it was their job to find out what thes e flying saucer stories were all about,\" Hynek recalls. Hynek was hired as a consultant with the Air Force and remained in that capacity for over tw o decades as Sign evolved into Projects Grudge and Blue Book, the las t officially ceasing in December of 1969. According to Hynek, the Air Force had a simple, but effective, method to explain UFOs: Dismiss all sightings as misidenti fied astronomical phe- nomena. The problem, says Hynek, was the Air Force \"regarded it as an intelligence matter\" instead of handing the investi gation to an academic or university group. Therefore, any serious investigat ion of the new phe- nomena was stultified [rendered useless] because to p military brass believed it was an \"intelligence\" matter, another i ntrigue of the emerging Cold War. However, military personnel directly involved in Pr oject Sign had a different view. While 96 percent of reports turned out to be misidentified astronomical phenomena (e.g., the planet Venus), th e other 4 percent were not so easily discredited or explained, and a minor ity of military person- nel took these seriously. Minority intelligence opinion then divided into the two camps, name- ly, those who saw UFOs as evidence of new Soviet te chnology, and those who thought they might be precursors of an invasion by extraterrestrials. \"FLYING SAUCERS\" AND THE CIA Ever since 1948 the CIA has maintained an interest in UFOs and remains tight-lipped to this very day on the subject, keepi ng evidence and docu- ments on the phenomena many levels above Top Secret . A memo sent on January 29, 1952 to the CIA's deputy director of Intelligence from Ralph Clark of the Office of Scie ntific Intelligence (OSI) states: \"In the past several weeks numerous U FOs have been sight- ed visually and on special UFO group radar. This of fice has maintained a continuing review of reputed sightings for the past three years and a spe- cial group has been formed to review the sightings to date.\" Many researchers believe that from the very beginni ng the CIA was quite certain UFOs were not j u s t Soviet technology. In fact, as evidence"},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"The Suppression of UFO Technologies and Extraterres trial Contact 349 accumulated pointing to the possible extraterrestri al origin of UFOs, the CIA became increasingly nervous that other U.S. gov ernment agencies might launch their own inquiries into the matter. S ecrecy would be an impossibility if everyone investigated UFOs, and in a matter of time, details would leak to the media and the public. In response to these concerns, the CIA began a proc ess of maintain- ing a tight rein over the investigations to ensure no public inquiries would ever take place. To discredit the phenomenon, the C IA set up a panel of experts whose job was to explain away UFOs. The CIA convened on 14 January, 1953, a confab that became known as the Robertson Panel, after its Chairman Dr. H. P . Robertson, then di- rector of the Weapons Systems Evaluation Group in t he Office of the Secretary of Defense, and also a CIA employee. The sequence of events leading directly to the Robe rtson Panel involved a series of UFO sightings over the nation' s capital in the summer of 1952, sightings confirmed by military personnel, including radar oper- ators and scrambled interceptor pilots, and which t hemselves resulted in the largest post-WWII military press conference to date. At the press con- ference itself, the repeated radar sightings were p ut down to \"temperature inversions,\" and the attending Air Force officers m ade no mention of the scrambled jet fighters. Besides the esteemed Dr. Robertson, the Panel also included as mem- bers physicist Dr. Luis Alvarez, later a Nobel Laur eate, Dr. Samuel Goudsmit, another physicist from Brookhaven Nationa l Laboratories who was an associate of Einstein's and had discovered e lectron spin, a former University of Chicago astronomer and then deputy di rector of the Johns Hopkins Operations Research office, Dr. Thornton Pa ge, and finally Dr. Lloyd Berkner, yet another physicist and one of Bro okhaven's directors. The Panel was addressed by a variety of CIA and Air Force personnel who reviewed some twenty of the better UFO cases an d showed two film strips of alleged flying saucers, one of which purp ortedly portrayed objects characterized as \"self-luminous\" by no less an authoritative source than the Navy's Photograph Interpretation Laborator y which had spent over 1,000 hours analyzing the particular movie fil m in question. Although impressive evidence was presented by the p anel, highlighted by detailed reports documented by the Air Force, it s recommendations read like they were formulated before the panel eve n convened. The CIA had already developed a cover story to cloak the re al story: UFOs were to be dismissed as just another scientific enigma, a C old War datum, one that might be cleverly manipulated by t h e enemy. In short, the Robertson Panel ruled \"that the evide nce presented on Unidentified Flying Objects shows no indication tha t these phenomena"},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"350 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries constitute a direct physical threat to national sec urity.\" While this ruling is considered contentious by many UFO researchers, it was the panel's second conclusion that really shocked. The panel de creed there was no national security threat from UFOs, however, its me mbers did see a real and distinct danger posed by UFO reports! In the panel's own words, it concluded \"that the co ntinued emphasis on the reporting of these phenomena, in these perilous times, result in a threat to the orderly functioning of the protective organs of the body politic.\" \"We cite as an example [of such danger],\" the Panel continued, \"the clogging of channels of communication by irrelevant reports, the danger of being led by continued false alarms to ignore re al indications of hostile action, and the cultivation of a morbid national ps ychology in which skill- ful hostile propaganda could induce hysterical beha vior and harmful dis- trust of duly constituted authority.\" In other word s, UFO reports might induce national psychosis that could be subject to manipulation by the Soviets. In the final list of recommendations, the panel cal ls for \"national secu- rity agencies to take immediate steps to strip the Unidentified Flying Objects of the special status they have been given. . . .\" The CIA had effectively halted any serious research into the phenome- na, and now controlled all ongoing U.S. military in vestigations. RUPPELT VS. THE CIA The public became aware of the panel a few years la ter with the publica- tion of \"The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects\" by Captain Edward J. Ruppelt, former commander of Project Blue Book. Both Ruppelt and his Intelligence Liaison Officer, Major Dewey J. Fo urnet, gave evidence to the Robertson Panel. Although the panel relegated UFOs to the dustbin of history, Walter Smith, then director of the CIA, saw fit to keep al l evidence classified. The CIA's decision shocked Captain Ruppelt and Majo r Fournet. Both were part of the minority of intelligence officials that believed the evi- dence for UFOs was incontrovertible. They also beli eved the possibility of hysteria would be reduced if the public were tol d the truth. Ruppelt had fought hard to keep the Air Force inves tigations afloat, after joining the Project Grudge team in January 19 51, but soon found the CIA constantly interfering and withholding valuable information. Project Grudge evolved into the now famous Project Blue Boo k in March 1952 with Captain Ruppelt appointed as its chief. All th is came in response to a spate of UFO sightings, beginning with the 25 Augus t, 1951 famous sight- ings at Lubbock, Texas, which caused an enormous st ir with the American public. And soon after, on 12 September, 1951, a major UFO sighting"},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"The Suppression of UFO Technologies and Extraterres trial Contact 351 above the skies of Fort Monmouth [New Jersey] in cl ear view of visiting military brass, contributed to the Air Force's new found enthusiasm. Ruppelt first became aware of the CIA's unwanted pr esence after the Washington UFO \"invasion\" of July 1952, when he was hampered from doing his job, and witnesses to the sightings were intimidated into chang- ing their reports or simply remaining silent. The person who most worried Ruppelt was Chief of St aff General Hoyt S. Vandenberg. It was Vandenberg who had buried Pro ject Sign's official UFO \"Estimate\" report, caused its incineration, and had the project renamed Project Grudge. It is not clear just how much Vande nberg was influencing top military officials responsible for implementing the Air Force's UFO projects. Vandenberg had been head of the Central I ntelligence Group (later the CIA) from June 1946 to May 1947, and his uncle was once chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, then the most powe rful committee in the U.S. Senate. Clearly, Vandenberg still had great in fluence in those areas— and according to Ruppelt, pressure was always comin g from them to sup- press the results of official UFO investigations. Thus, Ruppelt was not surprised when the CIA and ot her high-ranking officers including General Vandenberg convened a pa nel of scientists to \"analyze\" all the Blue Book data. Nor was he too su rprised when the Robertson Panel found that no further study was nec essary. The pieces of the jigsaw puzzle started to fall int o place. It was clear to Captain Ruppelt and other members of Project Blue B ook, that the pur- pose of the Robertson Panel was to enable the CIA a nd Air Force to state in the future that an impartial body had examined t he UFO data and found no evidence for anything unusual in the skies. Subs equently, the Air Force embarked upon a public relations campaign to elimin ate UFO reports totally. The CIA decided not to declassify the sigh ting reports and to tight- en security even more while continuing to deny \"non -military personnel\" access to UFO files. One month later CIA director Walter Smith classifie d all UFO docu- mentation and all subsequent directors continued to endorse the policy. INITIATION OF A COVER-UP In August 1953 Ruppelt left the Air Force out of di sgust and because of the limitations placed on his work by the CIA. The same month the Pentagon issued the notorious Air Force Regulation 200-2, that prohibit- ed the release of any information about a sighting to the public or media, except when it was positively identified as natural phenomenon. The new regulation also ensured that all sightings would be classified as restricted. In December 1953 the much worse Joint-Army-Navy-Air Force Pub- l i c a t i o n 146 made the releasing of any information to the public a crime"},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":"352 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries under the Espionage Act. And the most ominous aspec t of JANAP 146 was that it applied to anyone who knew it existed, incl uding commercial airline pilots. Any information flow to the public was effe ctively cut. By the end of the year Project Blue Book was severe ly decimated and for all intents and purposes, UFO research plunged into secrecy and under the control of the CIA. In just over six years sinc e Kenneth Arnold's sight- ing of strange silvery objects, the infamous intell igence agency had se- cured complete official silence on the subject of U FOs. The cover-up began and continues today, due to the CIA's indomitable power over all other intelligence groups within the U.S. security estab- lishment. The truth is out there . . . and it just might be somewhere deep inside the secret files of the CIA."},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"NASA Timothy Good The National Aeronautics and Space Administration, established in 1958, coordinates and directs the aeronautical and space research programme in the United States. Its budget for space activities alone is larger than the general budgets of a number of the world's importan t countries. Although officially a civilian agency, NASA collabo rates with the Department of Defense, National Reconnaissance Offi ce, National Security Agency, and other agencies, and many of its personn el have security clearances owing to the sensitive intelligence aspe cts of its programmes. Research into UFOs is one such programme. In May 1962 NASA pilot Joseph A. Walker admitted th at it was one of his appointed tasks to detect unidentified objects during his flights in the rocket-powered X-15 aircraft, and referred to f ive or six cylindrical shaped objects that he had filmed during his record -breaking high flight in April that year. He also admitted that it was th e second occasion on which he had filmed UFOs in flight. \"I don't feel l ike talking about them,\" he said during a lecture at the Second National Con ference on the Peace- ful Uses of Space Research in Seattle, Washington. \"All I know is what appeared on the film which was developed after the flight.\" Britain's FSR magazine cabled NASA headquarters req uesting further information and copies of stills from the film take n by Walker. \"Objects reported by NASA pilot Joe Walker have now been ide ntified as ice flak- ing off the X-15 aircraft,\" NASA replied. \"Analysis of additional cameras mounted on top the X-15 led to identification of th e previously unidenti- fiable objects. . . . No still photos are available .\" [Emphasis added.] In July 1962 Major Robert White piloted an X-15 to a height of fifty- eight miles at the top of his climb, and on his ret urn reported having seen as strange object. \"I have no idea what it could be ,\" he said. \"It was gray- ish in color and about t h i r t y to forty feet away.\" Then, according to Time magazine, Major White is reported to have said exci tedly over his radio:"},{"pageNumber":362,"pageContent":"354 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries \"There are things out there. There absolutely is!\" \"Two years ago,\" a NASA scientist said in 1967, \"mo st of us regarded UFOs as a branch of witchcraft, one of the foibles of modern man. But so many reputable people have expressed interest in co nfidence to NASA, that I would not be in the least surprised to see t he space agency begin work on a UFO study contract within the next twelve months.\" One of those who expressed interest was Dr. Allen H ynek, who want- ed NASA to use its superlative space-tracking netwo rk to monitor and document the entry of unidentified objects into the Earth's atmosphere. The problem then—as now—is that UFO sightings track ed by NASA remain exempt from public disclosure since they are classified top secret. But there have been leaks. In April 1964 two radar technicians at Cape Kennedy revealed that they had observed UFOs in pursuit of an unmanned Gemini space capsule. And in January 1961 it was reliably reported that the C ape's automatic track- ing gear locked on to a mysterious object which was apparently following a Polaris missile over the South Atlantic. A 1967 NASA Management Instruction established proc edures for han- dling reports of sightings of objects such as \"frag ments or component parts of space vehicles known or alleged by an obse rver to have impacted upon the earth's surface as a result of safety dest ruct action, failure in flight, or re-entry into the earth's atmosphere,\" a nd also includes \"reports of sightings of objects not related to space vehicl es.\" A rather euphemistic way of putting it, to be sure, but the internal ins truction continues: \"It is KSC [Kennedy Space Center] policy to respond to rep orted sightings of space vehicle fragments and unidentified flying obj ects as promptly as possible. . . . Under no circumstances will the ori gin of the object be dis- cussed with the observer or person making the call. '' [Emphasis added.] A 1978 NASA information sheet gives the agency's of ficial policy on the subject: NASA is the focal point for answering public enquir ies to the White House relating to UFOs. NASA is not engaged in a re search program involving these phenomena, nor is any other governm ent agency. Reports of unidentified objects entering United States air space are of interest to the military as a regular part of defense surveilla nce. Beyond that, the U.S. Air Force no longer investigates reports of UF O sightings. In 1978 CAUS (Citizens Against UFO Secrecy) filed a request for information relating to a NASA report entitled UFO Study Considera- tions, which had previously been prepared in associ ation with the CIA. In his response, Miles Waggoner of NASA's Public Infor mation Services Branch denied this. \"There were no formal meetings or any correspon-"},{"pageNumber":363,"pageContent":"The Suppression of UFO Technologies and Extraterres trial Contact 355 dence with the CIA,\" he stated. Following another e nquiry by CAUS, NASA's Associate Administrator for External Relatio ns, Kenneth Chapman, explained that the NASA report had been pr epared solely by NASA employees but that the CIA had been consulted by telephone to determine \"whether they were aware of any tangible or physical UFO evi- dence that could be analyzed; the CIA responded tha t they were aware of no such evidence, either classified or unclassified .\" NASA's statement in the 1978 information sheet that it was not engaged in a research programme involving UFOs, \"nor is any other government agency,\" is demonstrably false, as is its denial of Air Force investigations. In a leaked secret document purporting to originate with the Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) headquarte rs at Boiling Air Force Base, DC, there appears an intriguing referen ce to clandestine government UFO research, led by NASA. The document is dated 17 November 1980, and includes this relevant passage: SEVERAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, LED BY NASA, ACTIVELY INVESTIGATE LEGITIMATE SIGHTINGS THROUGH COVERT COVER. . . . ONE SUCH COVER IS UFO REPORTING CENTER , U.S. COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY, ROCKVILLE, MD 20852. NAS A FILTERS RESULTS OF SIGHTINGS TO APPROPRIATE MILITAR Y DEPARTMENTS WITH INTEREST IN THAT PARTICULAR SIGHTI NG. \"We have no information relative to the contents of the document,\" NASA told me in 1985. \"Additionally, we have been i nformed that [it] is not an authentic AFOSI document.\" In this case, NAS A is right. Although substantially legitimate, the document is a re-type d version containing errors, including the reference to NASA, which shou ld be NSA—the National Security Agency. PRESIDENT CARTER SEEKS TO RE-OPEN INVESTIGATIONS During his election campaign in 1976, Jimmy Carter revealed that he had seen a UFO at Leary, Georgia, in 1969, together wit h witnesses, prior to giving a speech at the local Lions Club. \"It was th e darndest thing I've ever seen,\" he told reporters. \"It was big, it was very bright, it changed colors, and it was about the size of the moon. We watched i t for ten minutes, but none of us could figure out what it was. One thing' s for sure; I'll never make fun of people who say they've seen unidentifie d objects in the sky.\" Carter's sighting has been ridiculed by skeptics su ch as Philip Klass and Robert Sheaffer. While there appear to be legitimat e grounds for disputing the date of the incident, Sheaffer's verdict that t he UFO was nothing more"},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":"356 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries exotic than the planet Venus is not tenable. As a g raduate in nuclear physics who served as a line officer on U.S. Navy nuclear s ubmarines, Carter would not have been fooled by anything so prosaic as Venu s, and in any case he described the UFO as being about the same size as t he Moon. \"If I become President,\" Carter vowed, \"I'll make e very piece of infor- mation this country has about UFO sightings availab le to the public and the scientists.\" Although President Carter did all he could to fulfill his election pledge, he was thwarted, and it is clear t hat NASA had a hand in blocking his attempts to re-open investigations. Wh en Carter's science adviser, Dr. Frank Press, wrote to NASA administrat or Dr. Robert Frosch in February 1977 suggesting that NASA should become the \"focal point for the UFO question,\" Dr. Frosch replied that alth ough he was prepared to continue responding to public enquiries, he prop osed that \"NASA take no steps to establish a research activity in this a rea or to convene a sym- posium on this subject.\" In a letter from Colonel Charles Senn, Chief of the Air Force Com- munity Relations Division, to Lieutenant General Du ward Crow of NASA, dated 1 September 1977, Colonel Senn made the follo wing astonishing statement: \"I sincerely hope that you are successfu l in preventing a re- opening of UFO investigations.\" So it is clear that NASA (as well as the Air Force and almost certainly the CIA and National Security Agency) was anxious to ensure that the President's election ple dge remained unfulfilled. DR. JAMES MCDONALD Dr. James McDonald, senior physicist at the Institu te of Atmospheric Physics and Professor in the Department of Meteorol ogy at the University of Arizona, who committed suicide in unusual circum stances in 1971, tried unsuccessfully to persuade NASA to take on pr imary responsibility for UFO investigations. He reported in 1967: Curiously, I have said this both in NASA and fairly widely reported pub- lic discussions before scientific colleagues, yet t he response from NASA has been nil. . . . Even attempting to get a small group within NASA to undertake a study group approach to the available p ublished effort seems to have generated no response. I realize, of course, that there may be semi-political considerations that make it a wkward for NASA to fish in these waters at present, but if this is wha t is holding up serious scientific attention to the UFO problem at NASA, th is is all the more rea- son Congress had better take a good hard look at th e problem and reshuffle the deck. ... I have learned from a numbe r of unquotable sources that the Air Force has long wished to get r id of the burden of the troublesome UFO problem and has twice tried to \"pod dlo\" it to NASA— without success."},{"pageNumber":365,"pageContent":"The Suppression of UFO Technologies and Extraterres trial Contact 357 While McDonald recognized that there were \"semi-pol itical considera- tions\" affecting NASA's reluctance to become public ly involved in UFO investigations, he failed to perceive that UFOs are more an intelligence problem than a scientific one. He was simply unawar e of the true extent of NASA's secret involvement. THE PIONEERS One of the great pioneers in astronautics is Dr. He rmann Oberth, whom I had the honour of meeting in 1972. In 1955 Oberth w as invited by Dr. Wernher von Braun to go to the United States where he worked on rock- ets with the Army Ballistic Missile Agency, and lat er NASA at the George C. Marshall Space Flight Center. Oberth's statement s on the UFO ques- tion have always been unequivocal, and he told me t hat he is convinced UFOs are extraterrestrial in origin. In the followi ng he elaborated on his hypothesis for UFO propulsion: . . . today we cannot produce machines that fly as UFOs do. They are flying by means of artificial fields of gravity. Th is would explain the sud- den changes of directions. . . . This hypothesis wo uld also explain the piling up of these discs into a cylindrical or ciga r-shaped mothership upon leaving the earth, because in this fashion onl y one field of gravity would be required for all discs. They produce high-tension electric charges in order to push the air out of their path . . . and strong magnetic fields to influence the ionised air at higher altitudes. . . . This would explain t heir luminosity. . . . Secondly, it would explain the noiselessness of UFO flight. Finally, this assumption also explains the strong electrical and magnetic effects sometimes, but not always, observed in the vicinity of UFOs. Earlier, Dr. Oberth hinted that there had been actu al contact with the UFOs at a scientific level. \"We cannot take credit for our record advance- ment in certain scientific fields alone; we have be en helped,\" he is quoted as having said. When asked by whom, he replied: \"Th e people of other worlds.\" There are persistent rumours that the U.S. has even test-flown a few advanced vehicles, based on information alleged ly acquired as a result of contact with extra-terrestrials and the s tudy of grounded UFOs. In 1959 Dr. Wernher von Braun, another great space pioneer, made an intriguing statement, reported in Germany. Referrin g to the deflection from orbit of the U.S. Juno 2 rocket, he stated: \"W e find ourselves faced by powers which are far stronger than we had hither to assumed, and whose base is at present unknown to us.

As Dr. Robert Sarbacher has commented, von Braun was probably inv olved in the recoveries of crashed UFOs in the late 1940s, and i t is my opinion that he was constrained from elaborating on the subject owi ng to the security oath that he must have been subject to. I cannot prove t his, of course, any more than I can substantiate information I have received from a reliable source that top secret contacts have been made by extrater restrials with selected scientists in the space programme. It must be admit ted, though, that von Braun's statement comes close to corroborating this . What else could he have meant when he said, \"We are now engaged in ent ering into closer contact with those powers\"? The Soviets? NASA WITHHOLDS PHYSICAL EVIDENCE That NASA has been engaged in UFO research behind t he scenes is alone proven, to my satisfaction at least, by its shady i nvolvement in the analy- sis of metal samples discovered at the site where S ergeant Lonnie Zamora encountered a landed UFO and occupants at Socorro, New Mexico, in April 1964. On 31 July 1964 Ray Stanford and some m embers of NICAP* visited NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center at Green belt, Maryland, in order to have a rock with particles of metal on it analyzed by NASA sci- entists. Dr. Henry Frankel, head of the Spacecraft Systems Branch, direct- ed the analysis. The particles had apparently been scraped on to the rock by one of the UFO's landing legs. On first inspecti on of the rock through a microscope, Dr. Frankel declared that some of the particles \"look like they may have been in a molten state when scraped o nto the rock,\" and expressed the desire to remove them from the rock f or further analysis. Stanford agreed to this, but said that he wanted to retain half of the parti- cles for his own use. The researchers were invited to go to lunch while N ASA engineers conducted their analysis. After lunch, Stanford and the others (Richard Hall, Robert McGarey and Walter Webb), returned to the laboratory build- ing. A NASA technician brought the rock over to the group. \"As he hand- ed it to me,\" said Stanford, \"I was able to careful ly observe it in the bright light inside the room. The whole thing had been scr aped clean. Someone had gone over that rock with the equivalent of a fi ne-toothed comb. There was nothing, not a speck of the metal left. . . eve n the very few tiny par- ticles that I had known were rather well-hidden had been removed.\" When Stanford complained, the technician insisted t hat half of the sam- ples were still on the rock, as promised, but seein g Stanford's disbelief hasti- ly left the room. Dr. Frankel then returned, and af ter Stanford had remon- strated with him, explained what had happened. \"Wel l, we tried to leave you * National Investigations Committee on Aerial Pheno mena"},{"pageNumber":367,"pageContent":"The Suppression of UFO Technologies and Extraterres trial Contact 359 some,\" he said, \"but we also had to get enough to m ake an accurate analysis. The sample will be placed under radiation this afte rnoon, where it will remain the entire weekend. Monday, we will remove i t for X-ray diffraction tests. That should tell us the elements it contains ... if you will call me, say on Wednesday, I should be able to tell you somethin g very definite.\" Before contacting Dr. Frankel again, Stanford and M cGarey had a meeting with a U.S. Navy captain in Washington who was interested in the Socorro case. The captain told the researchers that they would never get their metal samples back from Frankel. \"If that metal is in any way unusual,\" he said, \"he will never give you any docu mentation to prove it . . . Those boys at Goddard know that they must rep ort any findings as important as a strange, UFO alloy to the highest au thority in NASA. Once that authority receives the news, the President wil l be informed, for the matter is pertinent to national security and stabil ity. A security directive will instruct those self-appointed authorities at G oddard as to just whose hands the matter is really in. .. .\" On 5 August 1964 Ray Stanford phoned Dr. Frankel at the Goddard Space Flight Center. \"I'm glad you called,\" the sci entist said. \"I have some news that I think will make you happy.\" He wen t on: The particles are comprised of a material that coul d not occur naturally. Specifically, it consists predominantly of two meta llic elements, and there is something that is rather exciting about th e zinc-iron alloy of which we find the particles to consist: Our charts of all alloys known to be manufactured on Earth, the U.S.S.R. included, do not show any alloy of the specific combination or ratio of the two mai n elements involved here. This finding definitely strengthens the case that might be made for an extraterrestrial origin of the Socorro object. Dr. Frankel added that the alloy would make \"an exc ellent, highly mal- leable, and corrosive-resistant coating for a space craft landing gear, or for about anything where those qualities are needed.\" H e also said that he was prepared to make a statement before a Congressional hearing to this effect, if necessary. Frankel went on to say that further analysis would be carried out, and that Stanford should call him again the following w eek. On 12 August Stanford placed a call to Frankel, but was told by his secretary that he was \"not available\" and suggested he try contacting him the following day. On 13 August Stanford phoned again. \"Dr. Frankel simpl y is not available today,\" the secretary announced. \"He wonders if you might try him the first part of next week?\" On 17 August Stanford rang Frankel's office, only t o be told yet again that he was not a v a i l a b l e . Ominously, the secretary added: \"Dr. Frankel is"},{"pageNumber":368,"pageContent":"360 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries unprepared, at this time, to discuss the informatio n you are calling about.\" On 18 August Stanford tried again. \"I'm sor ry,\" the secretary said, \"but Dr. Frankel is in a top-level security confere nce. I doubt that he will be able to talk with you until tomorrow or the next day.\" Failing to get hold of Frankel the following day, S tanford left a tele- phone number with the secretary. On 20 August Thoma s P. Sciacca Jr. of NASA's Spacecraft Systems Branch phoned Stanford. \" I have been appointed to call you and report the official concl usion of the Socorro sample analysis,\" he said. \"Dr. Frankel is no longe r involved with the mat- ter, so in response to your repeated enquiries, I w ant to tell you the results of the analysis. Everything you were told earlier b y Dr. Frankel was a mis- take. The sample was determined to be silica, SiO 2 \" In 1967 Dr. Allen Hynek invited Ray Stanford to a l ecture he was giv- ing in Phoenix, and afterwards Hynek asked: \"Whatev er happened with the analysis at Goddard of that metallic sample fro m the rock you took from the Socorro site?\" Both Hynek and Stanford had been closely involved in investigations at the landing site, but Stanford was puzzled as to how Hynek knew about the NASA analysis. \"I was n ot sure where Hynek had learned of the fact that I had taken the rock which Lonnie Zamora had pointed out to both of us, and which the astronomer had ignored,\" he said. \"I was interested to note that h e specifically knew it was analyzed at Goddard. That fact had never been publi shed.\" Stanford told Hynek that NASA's \"official\" analysis had revealed it to be common silica. \"That cannot be true!\" exclaimed Hynek. \"I am famil- iar with the analysis techniques involved. Silica c ould not be mistaken for a zinc-iron alloy. They haven't given you the truth ! I would accept Frankel's original report and forget the later disc laimer.\" Given that the original analysis was accurate it is worth recording NASA Administrator Dr. Robert Frosch's statement in the letter he wrote to President Carter's science advisor, Dr. Frank Pr ess, in 1977: \"There is an absence of tangible or physical evidence availab le for thorough labo- ratory analysis ... To proceed [therefore] on a res earch task without a dis- ciplinary framework and an exploratory technique in mind would be wasteful and probably unproductive.\" THE SILVER SPRING FILM In my first book I devoted a chapter to the controv ersial 8mm colour movie film taken by George Adamski in the presence of Madeleine Rodeffer and other unnamed witnesses outside Madele ine's home at Silver Spring, Maryland, in February 1965. I have b een taken to task for endorsing the authenticity of this \"obviously fake\" film taken by a \"proven charlatan,\" but I have yet to see any concl usive evidence that it"},{"pageNumber":369,"pageContent":"The Suppression of UFO Technologies and Extraterres trial Contact 361 was actually faked. Both my co-author Lou Zinsstag and I exposed as many of the inconsistencies in Adamski's claims tha t were available to us at the time of writing, but that short piece of fil m, taken a few months before Adamski's death, remains authentic in my opi nion at least. Sometime between 3 and 4 P . M . on 26 February 1965 an unidentified craft of the famous type photographed by Adamski in 1952 (and others subsequently) described a series of manoeuvres over Madeleine's front yard, retracting and lowering one of its three pods and making a gentle humming and swishing sound as it did so. Adamski be gan filming the craft with Madeleine's 8 mm camera. \"It looked blackish-b rown or grayish- brown at times,\" Madeleine told me, \"but when it ca me in close it looked greenish and blueish, and it looked aluminium: it d epended on which way it was tilting. Then at one point it actually stood absolutely still between the bottom of the steps and the driveway.\" The craf t then disappeared from view, but reappeared above the roof and described m anoeuvres once more before finally disappearing vertically. Madeleine t old me that she could make out human figures at the portholes, but detail s were obscured. When the film was developed the following week some thing was obvi- ously wrong with many of the frames and it was appa rent that it had been interfered with. Obviously faked frames had been su bstituted by person or persons unknown. \"They took the original film,\" Mad eleine believes, \"and what I think they did was rephotograph portions of the original... and then fake some stuff. The film I got back is not the ori ginal film at all.\" Fortunately enough frames showing the craft as they had remembered it survived out of the twenty-five feet that had be en taken, and these were analyzed by William T. Sherwood, an optical physici st who was formerly a senior project development engineer for the Eastm an-Kodak Company in Rochester, NY. I spent many hours discussing the film with Bill, and in 1968 he provided me with a brief technical summa ry of his evaluations as they related to the prints he made from the \"ori ginal\" film. It's hard to capture the nuances of the original fi lm. None of the movie duplicates are good: too much contrast. The outline s look \"peculiar\" due to distortions, I believe, caused by the \"forcefiel d.\" The glow beneath the flange is, I think, significant. Incidentally, the tree [near the top of which the craft manoeuvred] is very high (90 ft?). Roughl y, the geometry of imagery is this: In 1977 Bill Sherwood sent me further details of hi s evaluations: The camera was a Bell & Howell Animation Autoload S tandard 8, Model"},{"pageNumber":370,"pageContent":"362 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries 315, with a fl.8 lens, 9-29 mm, used in the 9mm pos ition.... As you can measure, the image on the film (original) is about 2.7mm maximum. So for a 90 ft distant object, [the diameter] would be about 27 feet. ... It was a large tree, and the limb that the saucer seem s to \"touch\" could have been about that distance from the camera . . . but unfortunately I could not find a single frame where the saucer coul d clearly be said to be behind the limb. So it is not conclusive as for distance, and therefore for size. ... In some of the frames of the original , portholes are seen. In reply to my query as to whether it was possible to authenticate the film unequivocally, Bill said that there is no abso lutely foolproof way of assessing whether a photo is \"real\" or not. One mus t just take everything into account, including as much as one can learn ab out the person involved, and then make an educated guess. In the f inal analysis, he said, it comes down to this question: \"Is this the kind o f person whom I can imagine going to all the trouble and expense of sim ulating what only a well-equipped studio with a large budget could begi n to approximate, and defending it through the years with no apparent gai n and much inconven- ience?\" One of the peculiarities of the film is that the ou tlines of the craft look peculiarly distorted at times. Bill Sherwood believ es this is due to a pow- erful gravitational field that produces optical dis tortions, an opinion that is shared by Leonard Cramp, an aeronautical enginee r and designer who has worked for De Havilland, Napier, Saunders-R oe, and Westland Aircraft companies. In his pioneering book, Piece f or a Jig-Saw, Cramp proposed a theory to account for this peculiar effe ct: Earlier, when discussing light in terms of the G [g ravitational field] theo- ry, we saw how we might expect such a field to form an atmospheric lens, producing optical effects which might be furt her augmented by other field effects as well as the gravitational be nding of light. . . . Now it follows that if there would be a local increase in atmospheric pressure due to a powerful G field, then similarly we could expect a decrease in atmospheric pressure to accompany a powerful R [rep ulsion] field, and again we would not be surprised to find optical eff ects ... we can now say, while a G field might produce optical magnifyi ng properties, an R field could produce optical reducing properties. Leonard Cramp had not seen the Silver Spring film p rior to publishing his book, and was delighted that it seemed to confirm h is hypothesis. Like Bill Sherwood and myself, he is in no doubt that th e film is authentic. On 27 February 1967 (two years after it had been ta ken) the film was shown to twenty-two NASA officials at the Goddard S pace Flight Cen- ter. Discussion afterwards lasted for an hour and a half, and just before"},{"pageNumber":371,"pageContent":"The Suppression of UFO Technologies and Extraterres trial Contact 363 Madeleine left, one of the two friends with her was allegedly told that it was \"a very important piece of film\" and that the c raft was twenty-seven feet in diameter (the figure calculated independent ly by Bill Sherwood). Unfortunately, I have been unable to confirm this. In reply to my queries, NASA scientist Paul D. Lowm an Jr., of the Geophysics Branch at Goddard, stated that according to one of those pres- ent, Herbert A. Tiedemann, everyone considered the Silver Spring film to be fake. Dr. Lowman, who had helped set up the meet ing but was unable to attend, offered the following comments on the co lor photos from the film that I sent him: First, it is not possible to make any precise deter mination of the object's size from the relationship (which is basically corr ect) quoted by Mr. Sherwood. Given any three of these quantities, one can calculate the fourth. The focal length and image size are obvious ly known, but not the distance, which can only be roughly estimated. The equation can be no better than its most inexact quantity, and one migh t as well just estimate the size of the object directly. My own strong impr ession is that these frames show a small object, perhaps up to 2 or 3 fe et across, a short distance from the camera. Judging from the photo of Mrs. Rodeffer's house, a 27 foot UFO would have occupied most of th e cleared area in the front yard, and from such a short distance woul d have been a very large photographic object. Although Bill Sherwood readily concedes that his es timate of the pre- cise distance from the camera is arbitrary, he is s ure that it is reasonably accurate, and my own tests at the site show that, w ith the camera lens set on wide angle (as it was at the time), an object of this approximate size and distance would appear exactly as it does on the film. That either Adamski or Madeleine (or both) could have faked the film using a small model, and then have the audacity to show it at NAS A, seems far-fetched in the extreme. Moreover, to produce the distortion effects as well as the lowering and retracting of one of the pods with a s mall model, is out of the question as far as I am concerned. As a semi-pr ofessional photogra- pher I can speak with some authority on the matter myself. Following the death of Adamski, Madeleine Rodeffer experienced a great deal of ridicule and harassment, and nearly a ll copies of the \"faked\" film have been stolen—in the United States and else where. Two photographs of an identical craft were taken by young Stephen Darbishire in the presence of his cousin Adrian Mye rs in Coniston, England, in February 1954. For the benefit of those who contend that Darbiahire had faked the pictures and recanted late r, the following state- ment from a letter he wrote to me in 1986 is i l l u mi n a t i n g :"},{"pageNumber":372,"pageContent":"364 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries .. . when I said that I had seen a UFO I was laughe d at, attacked, and surrounded by strange people. ... In desperation I remember I refuted the statement and said it was a fake. I was counter -attacked, accused of working with the \"Dark Powers\". . . or patronizing ly \"understood\" for following orders from some secret government depart ment. There was something. It happened a long time ago, a nd I do not wish to be drawn into the labyrinth again. Unfortunately the negatives were stolen and all the prints gone ... THE ASTRONAUTS In the early 1970s I had the pleasure of several me etings in Britain and the United States with the former U.S. Navy test pilot, intelligence officer, and pioneer astronaut Scott Carpenter, who had repu tedly seen UFOs and photographed one of them during his flight in the M ercury 7 capsule on 24 May 1962. Scott vehemently denied this, and pour ed scorn on other reports of sightings by fellow astronauts. I notice d that he appeared to be ill at ease when discussing the subject, and whenev er I produced docu- mentary evidence for official concern in this area he became visibly nerv- ous. But in November 1972 Scott kindly wrote on my behalf to astronauts Gordon Cooper, Dick Gordon, James Lovell and James McDivitt, asking about reports attributed to them. James Lovell repl ied as follows: I have to honestly say that during my four flights into space, I have not seen or heard any phenomena that I could not explai n.... / don't believe any of us in the space program believe that there a re such things as UFOs.... However, most of us believe that there mus t be a star like our sun that also has a planetary system [which] must s upport intelligent life as we know it.... I hope this is sufficient informa tion for Tim Good, and I hope he isn't too disappointed in my answer. [Empha sis added.] But according to the transcript of Lovell's flight on Gemini 7, an anom- alous object was encountered: SPACECRAFT: Bogey at 10 o'clock high. CAPCOM: This is Houston. Say again 7. SPACECRAFT: Said we have a bogey at 10 o'clock h igh. CAPCOM: Gemini 7, is that the booster or is that an actual sighting? SPACECRAFT: We have several, looks like debris u p here. Actual sighting. CAPCOM: . . . Estimate distance or size? SPACECRAFT: We also have the booster in sight . . ."},{"pageNumber":373,"pageContent":"The Suppression of UFO Technologies and Extraterres trial Contact 365 Franklin Roach, of the University of Colorado UFO s tudy set up by the Air Force in 1966, concluded that in addition to th e booster traveling in an orbit similar to that of the spacecraft, \"there was another bright object [the \"bogey\"] together with many illuminated partic les. It might be con- jectured,\" he said, \"that the bogey and particles w ere fragments from the launching of Gemini 7, but this is impossible if th ey were traveling in a polar orbit as they appeared to be doing.\" James McDivitt confirmed that although he did see a n unidentified object during the Gemini 4 flight on 4 June 1965, h e does not believe it was anomalous: During Gemini 4, while we were in drifting flight, I noticed an object out the front window of the spacecraft. It appeared to be cylindrical in shape with a high fineness ratio. From one end protruded a long, cylindrical pole with the approximate fineness of pencil. I had no idea what the size was or what the distance to the object was. It coul d have been very small and very near or very large and very far away . I attempted to take a photograph of this object wit h each of the two cameras we had on board. Since this object was only in my view for a short time, I did not have time to properly adjust the cameras and I just took the picture with whatever settings the camera had at that time. The object appeared to be relatively close and I went t hrough the trouble of turning on the control system in case I needed to t ake any evasive actions. The spacecraft was in drifting flight and when the sun shone on the duty window, the object disappeared from view. I wa s unable to relocate it, since the attitude reference in the spacecraft was also disabled, and I did not know which way to maneuver to find it. After landing, the film from Gemini 4 was flown bac k to Houston immediately, whereas Ed White and I stayed on the a ircraft carrier for three days. During this period of time a film techn ician at NASA evalu- ated the photographs and selected what he thought w as the photograph of this particular object. Unfortunately, what he s elected was a photo- graph of sunspots [flares] on the window and had no thing whatsoever to do with the object that I had seen. The photograph was released before I returned and had a chance to point out the error in the selection. I, sub- sequently, went through the photographs myself and was unable to find any photograph like the object I had seen. Apparent ly, the camera set- tings were not appropriate for the pictures. I do not feel that there was anything strange or ex otic about this par- ticular object. Rather, only that I could not ident ify it. In a combination of both Gemini 4 and Apollo 9 I saw numerous satellite s, some of which we identified and some of which we didn't. ... I ha ve seen a lot of objects that I could not identify, but I have yet t o see one that could be identified as a spaceship from some other planet. I can't say that there aren't any, only that I haven't seen any. I hope th is helps Tim."},{"pageNumber":374,"pageContent":"366 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries Neither Gordon Cooper nor Dick Gordon replied to Sc ott's letter, it seems, and I have never been able to receive a reply from Cooper, althought he has spoken publicly of his interest in the subject. In fact, interest in UFOs was one of the reasons that inspired him to become an astronaut. \"I . . . had the idea that there might be some interesting f orms of life out in space for us to discover and get acquainted with,\" he wro te in 1962. \"As far as I am concerned there have been far too many unexpla ined examples of unidentified objects sighted around the earth ... t he fact that many expe- rienced pilots had reported strange sights did heig hten my curiosity about space . . . This was one of the reasons, then, why I wanted to become an Astronaut.\" In 1978 Cooper attended a meeting of the Special Po litical Committee United Nations General Assembly in order to discuss UFOs. Later that year a letter from Cooper was read at another UN me eting: ... I believe that these extraterrestrial vehicles and their crews are vis- iting this planet from other planets, which are obv iously a little more advanced than we are here on earth. I feel that we need to have a top-level, coordinate d program to specif- ically collect and analyze data from all over the e arth concerning the type of encounter, and to determine how best to int erface with these vis- itors in a friendly fashion. Also, / did have occasion in 1951 to have two days of observation ... flights of them, of different sizes, flying in fighter formation, from east to west over Europe. [Emphasis added.] Cooper said that most astronauts were reluctant to discuss UFOs \"due to the great numbers of people who have indiscrimin ately sold fake and forged documents abusing their names and reputation s without hesita- tion.\" But he added that there were \"several of us who do believe in UFOs\" and who have had occasion to see a UFO on, ar ound, or from an aircraft. \"There was only one occasion from space w hich may have been a UFO,\" Cooper's letter revealed, without elaborati ng. A UFO seen on the ground by an astronaut? The only reference I have to such an incident is contained in an article whic h the late Lou Zinsstag translated from the French for me in 1973. Unfortun ately, I have neither the name of the paper nor the date, but the article was written by J. L. Ferrando, based on an interview with an astronaut a t a congress in New York in mid-1973, tape-recorded by Benny Manocchia. The name of the astronaut? None other than Gordon Cooper!

And there are thousands of witness reports a nd a quantity of doc- uments to prove this, but nobody wants to make them public. Why? Because authority is afraid that people may think o f God knows what kind of horrible invaders. So the password still is : we have to avoid panic by all means. I was furthermore a witness to an extraordinary phe nomenon, here on this planet earth. It happened a few months ago in Florida. There I saw with my own eyes a defined area of ground being consumed by flames, with four indentations left by a flying obj ect which had descend- ed in the middle of a field. Beings had left the cr aft (there were other traces to prove this). They seemed to have studied topography, they had collected soil samples and, eventually, they return ed to where they had come from, disappearing at enormous speed.... I hap pen to know that the authorities did just about everything to keep t his incident from the press and TV, in fear of a panicky reaction from th e public. I immediately wrote to Cooper at Aerofoil Systems I nc., Cape Canaveral, Florida, asking if there was any truth t o these statements. \"If the whole story is a hoax,\" I said, \"somebody ought to be sued.\" But there was no reply from him, even when I sent reminders a nd a stamped addressed envelope. I then wrote to Scott Carpenter , asking if he would forward it to Cooper, and this he promised to do. T o this day, I have heard nothing. In the same letter to Scott I asked for the complet e story of the photo- graph he took during his flight in Mercury 7 on 24 May 1962. According to a commentator on BBC TV in 1973, Carpenter had b een withdrawn from duties as an astronaut for wasting time taking pictures of \"sunrise.\" I thought this was rather unlikely, especially sinc e Scott's friend, Andre Previn, told me that Scott had not been allowed in space again owing to a slight heart murmur. The released photograph shows what some have interpreted as a UFO, others as a lens flare, ice c rystals, or the fabric and aluminium balloon that was deployed at one stage. I wanted the facts. When I reminded Scott of my request a year later, h e replied that he resented . . . your continuing implication that I am lying a nd/or withholding truths from you. Your blindly stubborn belief in Flying Sa ucers makes interest- ing talk for awhile, but your inability to rational ly consider any thought that runs counter to yours makes further discussion of no interest— indeed unpleasant in prospect—to me.

To me, that seems reasonable. In any event, my frie ndship towards, and respect for Scott remains undiminished. An anonymous source with secret clearance claims th at Carpenter told him that at no time when the astronauts were in spa ce were they alone: there was constant surveillance by UFOs. And Dr Gar ry Henderson, a sen- ior research scientist for General Dynamics, has co nfirmed that the astro- nauts are under strict orders not to discuss their sightings with anyone. Dr Henderson says that NASA \"has many actual photos of these crafts, taken at close range by hand and movie camera.\" In November 1979 Lou Zinsstag and I received an uno fficial invitation to visit the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in Hous ton. The invitation came from Alan Holt, a physicist and aerospace engi neer whose main work at that time centered on the development of th e astronaut and flight controller training programs associated with the Sp acelab. He is also engaged in theoretical research into advanced types of propulsion for spacecraft, and has long been involved in an unoffi cial NASA UFO study group called Project VISIT (Vehicle Internal System s Investigative Team). I asked about photographs and films of UFOs allegedly taken by astronauts and was simply told that the National Se curity Agency screens all films prior to releasing them to NASA. It may be coincidental that a former Director of th e National Security Agency and Deputy Director of the CIA, Lew Allen, w as appointed head of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in June 1982. J PL runs NASA's unmanned planetary space programme, whose phenomena l achievements include the landing on Mars by the Viking probes an d, more recently, the Voyagers which transmitted such spectacular picture s of Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus. Allen had also been the USAF Chief of S taff, and as one of the pioneers of aerial espionage served as deputy d irector for Advanced Plans in the Directorate of Special Projects of the National Re- connaissance Office, and later director of the NRO' s Office of Space Systems. NRO—America's most secret intelligence age ncy—liaises closely with the CIA, NSA—and of course NASA. In an interview in 1986, Lew Allen stated that up t o a third of JPL's work was funded by the Department of Defense, but g ave details of vari- ous fascinating civilian projects. \"One of the most exciting of these future programs, called Cassini,\" he said, \"is an investig ation of Saturn's moon Titan. Its atmosphere was too dense for the Voyager s to give us any clues about what lies beneath.

Chate lain believes that some UFOs may come from our own solar system—specif ically Titan. During a BBC radio interview in December 1972, astr onaut Edgar Mitchell, lunar module pilot on Apollo 14, was aske d by a listener if NASA had made any provisions for encountering extra -terrestrials on the Moon or nearby planets. He replied in the affirmati ve. When the inter- viewer intervened and suggested that, if and when w e ultimately come into contact with other civilizations, it would onl y be via radio-astronomy, Mitchell emphatically disagreed, making a point of recommending Allen Hynek's book, The UFO Experience, which contradicte d official policy on the subject. I wrote to Dr. Mitchell and asked him to elaborate on this and another statement he made on the programme, to the effect t hat there had been no concealment of UFO sightings either in transit to o r on the Moon, and that such information was open to all. Mitchell's assist ant, Harry Jones, replied: \"Dr. Mitchell asked me to write and tell y ou that to his knowledge there have been no unexplained UFO sightings. All u nexplained sightings have subsequently been explained. Dr. Mitchell pers onally attests that there has never been any lid of secrecy placed on a ny NASA astronaut that he is aware of.\" [Emphasis added.] Although puzzled by this contradictory reply I did not pursue the mat- ter further, since the publicity from UFO reports i n 1973 led to a number of positive statements by some other astronauts. \"I 'm one of those guys who has never seen a UFO,\" said Eugene Cernan, comm ander of Apollo 17, at a press conference. \"But I've been asked, an d I've said publicly I thought they were somebody else, some other civiliz ation.\" In 1979 former Mercury astronaut Donald Slayton rev ealed in an inter- view with Paul Levy that he had seen a UFO while te st-flying an aircraft in 1951: I was testing a P-51 fighter in Minneapolis when I spotted this object.

According to hitherto unconfirmed reports, both Nei l Armstrong and Edwin \"Buzz\" Aldrin saw UFOs shortly after that his toric landing on the Moon in Apollo 11 on 21 July 1969. I remember heari ng one of the astro- nauts refer to a \"light\" in or on a crater during t he televized transmission, followed by a request from mission control for furt her information. Nothing more was heard. According to former NASA employee Otto Binder, unna med radio hams with their own VHF receiving facilities that b y-passed NASA's broadcasting outlets picked up the following exchan ge: MISSION CONTROL: What's there? Mission control c alling Apollo 11. APOLLO 11: These babies are huge, sir. . . enormous . . . . Oh, God, you wouldn't believe it! I'm telling you there are other spacecraft out there . . . lined up on the far side of the crater edge . . . they're on the moon watching us... . The story has been relegated to the world of scienc e fiction since it first appeared, but in 1979 Maurice Chatelain, former chi ef of NASA commu- nications systems and one of the scientists who con ceived and designed the Apollo spacecraft, confirmed that Armstrong had indeed reported see- ing two UFOs on the rim of a crater. \"The encounter was common knowl- edge in NASA,\" he revealed, \"but nobody has talked about it until now.\" Soviet scientists were allegedly the first to confi rm the incident. \"According to our information, the encounter was re ported immediately after the landing of the module,\" said Dr. Vladimir Azhazha, a physicist and professor of mathematics at Moscow University. \"Neil Armstrong relayed the message to mission control that two lar ge mysterious objects were watching them after having landed near the moo n module. But his message was never heard by the public—because NASA censored it.\" According to another Soviet scientist, Dr. Aleksand r Kazantsev, Buzz Aldrin took color movie film of the UFOs from insid e the module, and continued filming them after he and Armstrong went outside. Dr. Azhazha claims that the UFOs departed just minutes after th e astronauts came out on to the lunar surface."},{"pageNumber":379,"pageContent":"The Suppression of UFO Technologies and Extraterres trial Contact 371 Maurice Chatelain also confirmed that Apollo 11's r adio transmissions were interrupted on several occasions in order to h ide the news from the public. NASA chief spokesman John McLeaish denied t hat the agency censored any voice transmissions from Apollo 11, bu t admitted that a slight delay in transmission took place, due simply to processing through electronic equipment. Before dismissing Chatelain's sensational claims, i t is worth noting his impressive background in the aerospace industry and space programme. His first job after moving from France was as an el ectronics engineer with Convair, specializing in telecommunications, teleme try and radar. In 1959 he was in charge of an electromagnetic research gro up, developing new radar and telecommunications systems for Ryan. One of his eleven patents was an automatic radar landing system that ignited retro rockets at a given altitude, used in the Ranger and Surveyor flights t o the Moon. Later, at North American Aviation, Chatelain was offered the job of designing and building the Apollo communication and data processi ng system. In his book, Chatelain claims that \"all Apollo and Gemini flights were followed, both at a distance and sometimes also qui te closely, by space vehicles of extraterrestrial origin—flying saucers, or UFOs ... if you want to call them by that name. Every time it occur red, the astronauts informed Mission Control, who then ordered absolute silence.\" He goes on to say: I think that Walter Schirra aboard Mercury 8 was th e first of the astro- nauts to use the code name \"Santa Claus\" to indicat e the presence of flying saucers next to space capsules. However, his announcements were barely noticed by the general public. It was a little different when James Lovell on board the Apollo 8 command module c ame out from behind the moon and said for everybody to hear: \"Pl ease be informed that there is a Santa Claus.\" Even though this happ ened on Christmas Day 1968, many people sensed a hidden meaning in th ose words. I asked Dr. Paul Lowman of NASA's Goddard Space Fli ght Center what he thought about the Apollo 11 story. He repli ed: Most of the radio communications from the Apollo cr ew on the surface were relayed in real time to earth. I am continuall y amazed by people who claim that we have concealed the discovery of e xtra-terrestrial activity on the Moon.The confirmed detection of ext raterrestrial life, even if only by radio, will be the greatest scientific d iscovery of all time, and I speak without exaggeration.The idea that a civilian agency such as NASA, operating in the glare of publicity, could hi de such a discovery is absurd, even if it wanted to.

Yet the rumours persist. NASA may well be a civilia n agency, but many of its programmes are funded by the defence budget, as I have pointed out, and most of the astronauts are subject to military security regulations. Apart from the fact that the National Security Agen cy screens all films (and probably radio communications as well), we hav e the statements by Otto Binder, Dr. Garry Henderson and Maurice Chatel ain that the astro- nauts were under strict orders not to discuss their sightings. And Gordon Cooper has testified to a UN committee that one of the astronauts actual- ly witnessed a UFO on the ground. If there is no se crecy, why has this sighting not been made public? Not all communications between the astronauts and g round control are public, as NASA itself admits. John McLeaish, C hief of Public Information at the Manned Spacecraft Center (now Ly ndon B. Johnson Space Center) in Houston, explained to me in 1970 t hat although there is no separate radio frequency used by the astronauts for private conversa- tions with mission control, private conversations, \"usually to discuss med- ical problems,\" are re-routed: \"When the astronauts request a private con- versation, or when a private conversation is deemed necessary by officials on the ground, it is transmitted on the same S-band radio frequencies as are normally used but it is routed through differen t audio circuits on the ground; and unlike other air-to-ground conversation s with the spacecraft, it is not released to the general public.\" But is there any truth to the Apollo 11 story? A fr iend of mine who for- merly served in a branch of British military intell igence has provided me with unexpected corroboration. I am not permitted t o reveal the name of my source, nor the location and date of the followi ng conversation that was overheard and subsequently confirmed by my frie nd, which will inevitably lay me open to charges of fabricating th e story or being the vic- tim of a hoax. Yet the story must be told, however apocryphal. A certain professor (whose name is known to me) was engaged in an earnest discussion with Neil Armstrong during a NAS A symposium, and according to my friend's recollection, part of the conversation went as fol- lows: PROFESSOR: What really happened out there with A pollo 11? ARMSTRONG: It was incredible ... of course, we h ad always known there was a possibility ... the fact is, we were warned off.

No , there is no question of a space station. PROFESSOR: But NASA had other missions after Apo llo 11 ?

Later, when my friend confronted Armstrong, the lat ter confirmed that the story was true but refused to go into further d etail, beyond admitting that the CIA was behind the cover-up. What does Neil Armstrong have to say about the matt er officially? In reply to my enquiry he simply stated: \"Your 'reliab le sources' are unreli- able.

Andrews In the field of UFO research, there is a constant t ug-of-war between zealot skeptics and zealot true believers, which like a Pu nch-and-Judy show dis- tracts public attention from open-minded attempts t o address the real issues, since both of these groups have their minds made up in advance. It is unfortunate that a large proportion of the ac ademic community falls into the category of zealot skeptics, insofar as UFO phenomena are concerned. Although regrettable, this is understand able, since any other attitude endangers the grants on which their liveli hood depends, as well as their prestige in the hierarchy's pecking order. The treatment Dr. John Mack received from his colle agues and the trust- ees at Harvard after his book on UFO abductions was published amply illustrates what happens when a previously respecte d professor investi- gates a taboo subject and comes up with unconventio nal conclusions. However, Dr. Mack emerged from the controversy rela tively unscathed, when one compares what happened to him with what ha ppened to Dr. James E. McDonald about a quarter of a century earl ier. Dr. James E. McDonald was Senior Physicist of the I nstitute of Atmos- pheric Sciences at the University of Arizona. He th ought that the Federal Power Commission was evading the evidence concernin g UFO involve- ment in the total power failure that paralyzed New York on July 13th, 1965, and dared to say so in front of a Congression al committee. His courageous statements on this and other occasions t riggered a torrent of derision and abuse, and he was ostentatiously os tracized by his col- leagues, in ways reminiscent of the treatment Dr. M ack recently received from his colleagues at Harvard. However, unlike Dr. Mack, Dr. McDonald was shortly thereafter found dead under suspicious circumstances, which to this day have not been satisfactorily elucidated .

No matter what the subject matte r, scientific research is supposed to be carried out impartially, followin g the trail of truth wher- ever it may lead, without skewing the results one w ay or another to make them fit preconceived biases. It should make no dif ference if the results are unpopular or subject to ridicule by the ignoran t who have not bothered to examine the evidence themselves, even if some of the ignorant happen to be in positions of authority that control resear ch grants and advance- ment in the academic hierarchy. It is the academic research community which sets th e tone for so-called serious media coverage, as well as statements made by government rep- resentatives. Because it has systematically depreca ted, minimized or denied evidence out of fear of ridicule, for a full half-century adopting an attitude of zealous skepticism, the academic commun ity now bears a large part of the responsibility for the catastrophic pre sent situation, in which the population as a whole must adjust to the shock of acknowledging the reality of the alien presence on this planet, altho ugh deeply conditioned for fifty years to dismiss it as a laughing matter, as easily controlled as a television set. Of course, the decision made in 1 953 by the CIA's Robertson Panel to pursue a policy of systematic ri dicule towards civilian UFO reports is also a major factor in the equation. This decision illustrates the extent to which contemporary science is influen ced by the mil- itary/industrial complex, since that disastrous pol icy is still being imple- mented to the present day. What is the evidence I claim is being arbitrarily d enied? An incident witnessed by a single person is always open to ques tion, and an eyewit- ness report on its own does not constitute substant ial evidence. However, in the investigation of a traffic accident or a cri me, if there are multiple witnesses who independently give similar descriptio ns of the event, their cumulative testimony tends to be taken seriously in a court of law. If there are literally hundreds or even thousands of witness es independently giv- ing similar descriptions of an event, the cumulativ e weight of their testi- mony becomes overwhelming. Long-term patterns over periods of sever- al decades that include entire populations of towns and cities making sim- ilar reports should be considered scientifically as even more decisively significant, no matter what the subject matter. The exception is the taboo topic of UFO phenomena. There are literal- ly hundreds of examples I could point to, but one i ncident illustrates par- ticularly well how this taboo operates. I'll begin by specifying my sources, which are arti cles in the following newspapers: Arkansas Gazette, Little Rock, AR, Janu ary 23, 1988; Arkansas"},{"pageNumber":384,"pageContent":"376 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries Democrat, Little Rock, AR, January 23, 1988; Gazett e, Texarkana, TX, January 23 & 24, 1988; BEE, Dequeen, AR, January 28 , 1988; Northwest Arkansas Times, Fayetteville, AR, February 4—8 and March 27, 1988; McCurtain County Gazette, Idabel, OK, April 10, 198 8. The magnitude and extent of the incidents that bega n to be reported on January 19, 1988, from Little River County in Arkan sas were on a scale that went beyond any other UFO phenomena that occur red in 1988. The incidents clustered around the towns of Foreman and Ashdown in south- west Arkansas, near the Texas border. A few sporadi c sightings had occurred in previous months, including a low-altitu de sighting of a UFO as large as a football field in November, 1987, but the witnesses did not dare speak out for fear of ridicule. The local popu lation tends to be quite conservative, and the first witnesses to go public after a UFO chased three women in a car at terrifyingly close range on Janua ry 19, 1988, were sub- jected to persistent harassment and ostracism, unti l hundreds of citizens began seeing the phenomena simultaneously and its r eality became unde- niable. A typical report described ... a ball of light that was as big as a hay wagon at first, but which got smaller when as many as 100 people gathered to look at it. The object changed color from red to green to blue. It was fir st seen near ground level, then flew high into the sky. It got under th e moon and it looked just like a star up there until everyone went away, then it came back down. When it was up off the ground, lights were flashing , and you had to see it to believe it. Witnesses included a professional astronomer, an Ai r Force veteran with 1,800 hours of flying time who had been a navi gator on a B-52, a sci- ence teacher who had been selected as a finalist fo r the NASA \"teacher in space\" program, and a design engineer familiar with propulsion systems. Photos were taken that neither the Arkansas Sky Obs ervatory, NORAD [North American Air Defense Command] or NASA were a ble to give plausible explanations for. However, Clay Sherrod, the Director of the Arkansas Sky Observatory, succeeded in insulting ev eryone's intelligence by maintaining that the extremely mobile metallic o bjects with multicol- ored flashing lights being perceived simultaneously by whole crowds of people, hovering at low altitude then suddenly risi ng straight up at incred- ible speed, performing maneuvers such as no known a ircraft can perform, were either misidentifications of the planet Venus or moonlight reflecting off the bellies of white snow geese flying overhead . Although newspaper coverage of the incidents ceased on March 27, the incidents continued to occur for approximately one full year well into 1989, without even being mentioned in the local pre ss. They were consid-"},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":"The Suppression of UFO Technologies and Extraterres trial Contact 377 ered no longer newsworthy, having been persistently disparaged by the authorities and the national news media, which parr oted the \"planet Venus\" and \"moonlight reflecting off the bellies of snow g eese\" explanations made by the Director of the Arkansas Sky Observatory, wh o was hundreds of miles away from the scene of the action in his offi ce in Little Rock. Besides the many eyewitness reports of UFO sighting s, there have been many cases that involve craft landings, sometimes w ith physical evidence of landing traces left behind after the craft's dep arture. These traces of physical evidence have often been carefully investi gated, and once again there are literally hundreds of examples I could po int to. However, one specific case is outstanding because of the remarka ble way these details were supported by the meticulously conducted resear ch of high-level sci- entists, which backed up the anecdotal eyewitness r eports with hard phys- ical evidence. Trans-en-Provence is a little village near Avignon in France. The inci- dent took place there at 5:10 P . M . on January 8, 1981. Renato Nicolai, aged 55, a retired mason who had become a farmer, saw a strange aircraft land in his garden, where it remained for about one minu te. It then took off and disappeared over the horizon. Mr. Nicolai thought that it was probably some sort of experimental craft being tried out by the French Air Force. He d id not believe in flying saucers. That evening when his wife came home from work, he described to her what he had seen. The next morning she went with him to look at the markings on the ground, then told a neighbor ab out the incident. The neighbor was frightened and informed the police. A contingent of the Draguignan police came to Mr. N icolai's farm. He described the craft to them as approximately 6 feet in length and 7 1/2 feet in diameter. The color was a dull gray, like that o f lead. The shape was flat and circular, bulging slightly above and below. The craft rested on small telescopic legs. There was no light, and no smoke o r flames. There was no sound except for a faint whistling. It first appear ed at an altitude of about 150 feet, like a mass of stone falling. However, it came down lightly on the ground. He approached it and could see the craft cl early. He had advanced about thirty paces toward it, when it took off at v ery high speed. When he saw the object from beneath, it was round, and had four port-holes. The police reported that there was a circular outli ne about half to three- quarters of an inch deep and 7 1/4 feet in diameter , with skid marks at two places. The site had the appearance of a circular s tain, being darker in color than its surroundings. The police collected s amples of soil and veg- etation along a straight line through the impact si te, writing on each sample taken its distance from the impact site. Upo n their return to Draguignan, they transmitted their report and the s amples to GEPAN"},{"pageNumber":386,"pageContent":"378 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries (Group for the Study of Unidentified Aerial and Spa ce Phenomena), which is a branch of CNRS (National Center of Space Research, the French equivalent of NASA). GEPAN passed the sample s on to INRA (National Institute of Agricultural Research) and s everal other govern- ment research institutes for analysis. GEPAN person nel visited the site to take further samples on two other occasions. On Jun e 7, 1983, after two and a half years of analyses, a bulky preliminary r eport which assembled data from the different laboratories was turned in. The government scien- tists attributed the circular outline to a soil fra cture caused by the com- bined action of strong mechanical pressure and a he at of about 600°C, which is about 1100°F. Dr. Bounias, who was the Dir ector of the Biochemical Laboratory at INRA, had personally take n charge of the examination of the plant specimens. He carried out the analyses in the most rigorous fashion possible. First he establishe d samples from plants of the same species (alfalfa), taken at different d istances from the point of impact. Then he and his assistants meticulously ana lyzed the photosyn- thetic pigments (such as carotene, chlorophyll, and xantophyle), the glu- cides, the amino acids and other constituents. He f ound differences suf- ficiently important that the statistical significan ce of the results is irrefutable. Certain substances that were present i n the close-range sam- ples were not present in those taken further away, and vice versa. The bio- chemical trauma revealed by examination of the leav es diminished as the distance from the UFO impact site increased. Some o f the plants had been dehydrated, but were not burned or carbonized. The following year con- trol samples were taken from the site, which confir med the changes made in the vegetation. After completing the analyses, D r. Bounias made the following formal statement: \"We worked on very youn g leaves. They all had the anatomic and physiologic characteristics of their age. However, they had the biochemical characteristics of advance d senescence, or old age! This bears no resemblance to anything known to exist on our planet.\" Dr. Bounias refused to speculate about the cause of the strange facts he had established, or to propose any explanation at a ll for them. Although neither Dr. Bounias nor the French governm ent have fol- lowed through on the implications of this evidence, or proceeded any fur- ther with it, at least as far as the general public is concerned, the Trans-en- Provence case remains one of the most strongly subs tantiated investiga- tions of landing traces in the history of UFO resea rch. Another aspect of UFO research which involves physi cal evidence is the crop circles, though there has been much disput e over whether they are caused by UFOs or by human hoaxers.

From 1978 to 1989, the shapes were for the most part simple circles. Howev er, since 1989, the patterns have become more and more intricate, elimi nating the possibility that they could be caused by unusual meteorological conditions. The summer of 1991 was a quantum leap as patterns o f rings and cir- cles became true complex pictograms. Straight bars, or boxes, and arcs, both inside and outside of circles, were combined w ith circles and rings to form complex pictograms. Some pictograms combined m ore than thirty elements. Crop circle developments during the summer of 1991 were well described by Michael Chorost in the October 1991 is sue of the MUFON [Mutual UFO Network] UFO Journal: One of the most interesting formations was a repres entation of the Mandelbrot set, a two-dimensional graph made famous by chaos theory . . . the last two seasons of crop circles h ave clustered densely in a tiny area containing Europe's most remarkable ancient construc- tions: Avebury, Silbury Hill, Windmill Hill, Barbur y Castle, Adam's Grave, the White Horses, and the East and West Kennet Long Barrows. . . . I invite my readers to consider that the mystery of the crop circles is very much like the mystery of the megaliths. Each consis ts of compelling geometric forms. No one knows why they were made, n or why they are where they are. Nor do we know how either were made . Perhaps the two mysteries are deeply intertwined. Not that eith er one \"caused\" or \"inspired\" the other, but that the two phenomena so mehow \"talk\" about the same thing, a thing still unknown to us, or \"do \" a single thing, taken together as a total system. It could be that solvin g one mystery will auto- matically solve the other. Chorost goes on to describe the research results of Marshall Dudley, a systems engineer for Tennelec/Nucleus of Oak Ridge, Tennessee, as well as those of Michigan biophysicist Dr. W. C. Levengo od. Dudley detected significant isotope changes in the soil samples fro m crop circles he had been provided with, and Levengood found that cell p its in plant cells in the affected formations had been subjected to rapid heating that had sep- arated the cell pits. He found this to be true in s amples from England, the United States and Canada. Another major breakthrough was made by Gerald Hawki ns, the author of Stonehenge Decoded, who discovered that in eight een photographs of crop circle formations, there was a repeated patter n of frequency ratios that are equivalent to the diatonic scale (the whit e keys on a piano). In addition to that finding, he has outlined four new theorems about rela-"},{"pageNumber":388,"pageContent":"380 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries tionships of triangles to circles to squares that h e finds in the crop circle formations, and these theorems do not exist in any known academic text. That is a very brief condensation of a large amount of highly complex technical research. In light of the fact that there is strong and abundant evidence in support of these results, one would thi nk that the news media would eagerly leap upon so thoroughly substantiated a sensational story, and proclaim it to the world in banner headlines an d TV special features. What actually happened? The world news media instead leaped eagerly on a fl imsy story full of holes: that two British senior citizens had \"confes sed\" to hoaxing the cir- cles with no equipment except some planks. This was triumphantly pro- claimed to the world as the final and definitive so lution to the mystery of the crop circles, in spite of the obvious fact that two men with planks can- not produce significant isotope changes in the soil , nor heating so rapid that it separates the cell pits without leaving bur n marks on the outside of the plants. Other obvious impossibilities deliberat ely ignored were how these two senior citizens had managed to make so ma ny hundreds of cir- cles without having once been detected, or how they managed to make patterns of such precision and size and complexity with planks while working in the dark. All the factual evidence was d eliberately ignored in order to convince the public that the mystery of th e crop circles had now been at least definitely solved: Doug and Dave did it. The public was bombarded with ten-second TV shots of Doug and Dave flattening some wheat with some planks, until finally the vast majo rity was conditioned into accepting this absurdity as the proven explana tion. The minority of those who persisted in trying to point out flaws in this explanation was then subjected to scathing ridicule and social ostr acism. Vast numbers of copy-cat imitators followed the example set by Doug and Dave, and have ever since devoted themselves to muddying the water and confusing the research picture, egged on with the full collaborat ion of the news media, intent on trivializing the subject. In spite of the sabotage and harassment, the resear ch haltingly contin- ues. An intriguing development that occurred recent ly in England is that a group of hoaxers busily at work making yet another faked crop formation noticed several balls of light hovering above them, which seemed to be under intelligent control. This frightened them to the point that they aban- doned their work and fled from the field. There are now quite a few eye- witness reports of small white discs and grapefruit -sized balls of light seen in the vicinity of the crop formations, and the sma ll white discs have been captured twice on videotape.

Then a n almost impenetrable security lid came down, to censor any evidence from official sources that life existed beyond the earth.

Their ideas have also been reinforced by the false disclo sures publicized through the media by those in control of past space ventures. Likewise, this article is not in direct opposition to general astronomy. In fact, a lot of information in this present work is based on the observa- tions and lifetime work of expert astronomers. But in establishing the truth about our solar system, it will be noted that there is little agreement with orthodox thinking in the astronomical field. A nd if one were to restrict himself to one field—any field—one would h ave very limited knowledge. Determining the reality behind UFOs requ ires a complete study involving the whole scope of space sciences. The problem with all planetary research and common speculation to date, must be defined here at the beginning. It is this: Official presenta- tions regarding planetary space conditions have bee n made to coincide with (complement) the long standing suppression, an d censorship, of the real UFO evidence by our government. This is why th e truth about Mars has never been known, publicized, or accepted, up t o the present. Yet it is an important correlation, that eighteen years of UF O sightings, with reports numbering into the thousands, predated the first U.S. space probe to reach Mars on a flyby in July, 1965. Of course, it was never officially admitted that UFOs were a major stimulus for us to investigate the plan- et. Now, in this present work, it will be establish ed that the Martian envi- ronment is very similar to earthly conditions, by a review of the early tel- escopic record, and then through a logical analysis of the more recent space probe developments. The early history of telescopic observation of Mars has been recounted in numerous books. It began in 1877, when Giovanni Schiaparelli observed through his 8.75 inch reflecting telescope , a number of long lines on the Martian surface that connected up to l arger dark areas. He described the lines as \"canali,\" which in his nativ e language meant chan- nels. But the translation quickly became \"canals,\" and his discovery of them led to the idea that intelligent beings on Mar s must have construct- ed artificial waterways. While Schiaparelli didn't publicly suggest that conclusion himself, he didn't really discourage oth ers who were promot- ing the idea, because he had found 113 different ca nali that were long, straight, and neatly defined. He intricately mapped the planet from years of observation. His maps were the standard for many years, and he gave ancient names from Biblical and classical mythology , along with names from the old geography of the Middle East, to the l arge surface areas and distinct markings of the planet. The names he gave to the surface features are still e x i s t e n t on maps today."},{"pageNumber":392,"pageContent":"384 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries A distinguished American astronomer, Percival Lowel l, decided to ded- icate his life to studying Mars. In 1894, he built the Flagstaff Observatory in Arizona, which housed a 24-inch refracting teles cope. By 1915, he and his staff had charted nearly 700 canals—a precise n etwork of large-scale construction on Mars that channeled water from the polar ice caps. They were straight, narrow, sometimes parallel, and at n umerous locations the canals intersected geometrically. These latter area s were noted to become seasonally dark, and Lowell named them oases, indic ating that vegetation and crop growing were abundant. He naturally conclu ded that there would be attendant cities for the Martian people at these oases. Lowell understood that the actual waterways could n ot be seen from Earth, if it were not for the broad areas of season al growth lining both sides. It was the combination of both factors that made it possible to see the network of geometric lines on Mars' surface wit h clarity. Some of the channels were approximately 3000 miles long, and fr om 15 to 25 miles wide. 1 In 1915 Lowell stated to the scientific world, \"Ma rs is inhabited, and we have absolute proof.\" He proclaimed that the Martian civilization had an intricate and highly advanced irrigation sys tem that could be seen and photographed through Earth-based telescopes. A few pictures had been taken as early as 1907. Lowell's position was so revolutionary to the orthodox views of the scientific establishment, tha t it received harsh con- tempt from many, and went virtually ignored by othe rs. Once every twenty-six months, Earth and Mars are at their closest dis- tance from each other in their orbits around the su n, and in astronomy this is called being in opposition. But because the orbi ts are elliptical, the most favorable opposition occurs only once every fifteen to seventeen years, and at this time the two planets are at their close st, about 35 million miles distant. To view the extensive canals and markings, an astronomer had to have unlimited patience and determination, and more importantly, an open mind. Like the establishment scientists today, Lowe ll's contemporaries often lacked such traits. Studying the distant feat ures on Mars through the telescope was difficult and tricky, and could only be done at the large observatories when the local atmospheric conditions and other visibility factors were exceptionally coordinated. But even du ring the brief periods of favorable opposition, the disk-like image showed a blurring of detail almost continuously, due to the ever-present atmosp heric turbulence around both the Earth and Mars. Our atmosphere is constantly in molecular motion du e to thermal activ- ity. To the naked eye, the sky might seem so clear and calm, that a person would assume there is perfect seeing conditions. Fo r looking at stars and nebulae, that would be true, but it's not the same when we view our neigh- boring planets with a large telescope. Through the high power magnifica-"},{"pageNumber":393,"pageContent":"The Suppression of UFO Technologies and Extraterres trial Contact 385 tion of a telescope, the barely perceptible dynamic s of heat (wind) move- ment in the atmosphere causes a slight shimmering e ffect, and while the broad features of a planetary image may be easily r ecognizable, any fine detail is lost in an almost continual slight blurri ng. Ever so momentarily, our atmospheric unsteadiness will cease for a secon d or two. At that pre- cise moment an astute telescopic observer will have a perfect seeing con- dition, and be able to see in fine detail the plane tary image 35 million miles away. Yet these views last but a few seconds, making it extremely difficult to obtain a distinct photograph. Furtherm ore, the only way that the photographic evidence of the canals can be obta ined is when the plan- et is viewed directly overhead. These observations must be made from the best suitable locations in our southern hemisphere. Lowell made a special expedition to Chile in 1907 a nd obtained the first photographic evidence of the canals. His succ essor, Dr. E. C. Slipher, had better success in later years with observations from South Africa, when camera equipment had improved considerably. Th e Martian canals are seen on plates VI and XLVII in the book, The Ph otographic Story of Mars, by E. C. Slipher. The edition I obtained was published by Northland Press, Flagstaff, Arizona, in 1962. The quality of photographs can always be debated by the establishment scientist who denies everything he has not seen for himself. In reality, the eye is superior in viewing telescopic images in det ail, compared to the photographic results when taking telescopic picture s of a planet 35 mil- lion miles distant. Dr. Slipher stated in 1962, \"Th e history of the canal problem shows that every skilled observer who goes to the best available site for his observations has had no great difficul ty of seeing and con- vincing himself of the reality of the canals. I am not aware of a single exception to this.\" A fellow astronomer, Dr. Pettit , confirmed this visual documentation, by reporting in 1953 that \"there are moments when the whole canal pattern can be seen on Mars.\" Today's literature never fails to mention that the early Mariner probes during the 1960's proved that the canals are non-ex istent, and that the con- troversy over the Schiaparelli and Lowell evidence has been laid to rest. It is true that no actual evidence of canals was re leased by NASA, but it should be realized, that if the picture-taking came ras on those early probes did photograph certain areas showing canals with su fficient clarity, the evidence would not have been released anyway. The f act is, that until Mariner 9, only a very small and unrepresentative f raction of the Martian surface was photographed, and most of that, very po orly. Mariners 4, 6, and 7 never even found the huge 2300-mile-long Vall es Marineus canyon on Mars, which is a natural formation. The fuzzy bl ack and white photos that were released to the public lacked any clarity whatsoever. We can get"},{"pageNumber":394,"pageContent":"386 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries better telescopic photographs of the Moon 240,000 m iles away, than those camera pictures taken only a few thousand miles fro m Mars. An impor- tant point to realize is that the probes carried ca meras, not telescopes. Even NASA admitted that the cameras aboard the Mari ners could not have provided evidence of a Martian civilization fr om their photographic distance. However, the publicly-released photos wer e quickly interpreted as disproving the canal controversy. What are space photographs in reality? The \"picture \" is relayed back to Earth in the form of numerous dots, contained withi n a radio signal. The picture has to be reconstructed from this electroni c message, by comput- er imaging each dot into a shade of gray. The first image processing is considered the raw picture, and is basically a wash ed-out, blurry gradation of gray. Then the imaging team can reassign the gra y levels by computer, in order to better distinguish any identifiable spo ts or features on the raw picture. A slightly improved image is given to the public. American astronauts have said that the only visible man-made construc- tion on Earth that they could see from their high o rbit around our planet was the Great Wall of China. If there were a Great Wall on Mars and it turned up on one of the photographs, the space agency coul d still release the pic- ture, but without the slightest trace of a wall. Wi th computer imaging, it is easy to fade out features and erase contrast, to th e point of an unidentifiable gray blotch. By starting with the original raw, was hed-out picture, it is only a matter of re-assigning the gray levels so that th e wall never appears dur- ing processing. On the other hand, if another photo graph shows a natural landmark or feature, that picture can be electronic ally sharpened and focused to show great detail. We have reached a new state of the art: we can increase or decrease picture quality by subtle elec tronic brushing. Now to clarify the situation regarding the canal ev idence first discov- ered by Schiaparelli and Lowell through their teles copic studies. It was only \"laid to rest\" because authorities withheld of ficial confirmation. Mariner 4 did photograph some straight-line canals, and this was finally admitted some time later by Dr. William Pickering, the head of Jet Propulsion Laboratory. 2 (JPL conducts all the planetary projects for NASA.) Dr. Clyde Tombaugh, the scientist who discov ered Pluto, also confirmed that the canals were photographed by the 1965 probe. But offi- cially, this type of evidence has never been releas ed. The public was shown computer-enhanced photographs, but the detail ed originals were in the hands of the authorities. And if the canals wer e filmed by that first probe, it is a certainty that they were filmed by l ater Mariner and Viking probes, yet that information has always been withhe ld. We'll discuss the censoring aspect relative to the later space missio ns thoroughly, but first let's continue with the telescopic record."},{"pageNumber":395,"pageContent":"The Suppression of UFO Technologies and Extraterres trial Contact 387 Early in this century, expert astronomers recorded several anomalies dur- ing their observations of Mars. On one occasion, a long series of blinking lights lasting seventy minutes was observed, leadin g one observatory direc- tor to describe the incident as \"absolutely inexpli cable.\" 3 In 1937 and again in 1949, Japanese experts witnessed a brilliant glo w on the surface of Mars, that was as bright as a 6th magnitude star. To be v isible from the Earth, these \"flares\" had to be tremendous. Any type of volcanic activity couldn't possi- bly be seen from our distance, and so the cause of the brightness remained a mystery. Other strange lights were seen on differen t occasions. There was a cloud-like object observed and photogra phed in 1954, that was in the perfect shape of a W, or an M if we cons ider that a telescope inverts an image. It was 1100 miles across and rema ined in a fixed position above the planet for more than a month. (Natural at mospheric clouds will change shape and dissipate within a few days.) At t he three intersections of the W, were intense bright spots, or \"knobs.\" Specu lation was running high, even at the Carnegie Institution at Washington. It was such a rigid and unusual shape, that there was a strong suggestion o f artificial origin. Throughout the 1920s and 30s, recurring radio signa ls were picked up coming from the direction of Mars. The spacing and pattern of the radio waves ruled out the possibility that these cryptic signals were random radio noise or electrical disturbances in space, be cause there was an intel- ligent coding system to these radio waves. That muc h was certain, even though they remained indecipherable on our end. Eve n the famous scien- tist Marconi, the man who invented the \"wireless,\" picked up these inter- planetary radio waves with his advanced experimenta l equipment in 1921, and later stated that he believed he had intercepte d messages from Mars. He emphasized that the transmission wavelength of t he coded signals was 150 kilometers, whereas the maximum wavelength used by our transmit- ting stations at the time was about 14 kilometers. 4 Many others had come to the same conclusion over th e next few years when intercepting these signals, especially when Ma rs was in orbital prox- imity to Earth. And speaking to the British Associa tion for the Advancement of Science in 1931, the late Bishop Barnes stated h is belief that many other inhabited worlds exist, and that many must ce rtainly be able to prop- agate interplanetary radio communication. It was su ch messages that were being picked up now, he said. And when these interp lanetary signals were recognized and acknowledged by our Earth, it would be the dawn of a new era of humanity. But at this beginning, he added, t here would be opposi- tion between those who welcome the new knowledge an d those who deem it dangerous for that information to be known and a ccepted. And is this not what happened two decades later, when UFOs demo nstrated the very existence of life on other worlds? Was it not the b eginning of an era of"},{"pageNumber":396,"pageContent":"388 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries opposition between those who were open and acceptin g of the new knowl- edge about space, and those who worked to prevent t he truth from com- ing out? Along with the later observations of mysterious clo uds and lights, the cryptic radio signals led some independent astronom ers to conclude that we were being given rudimentary signals from Mars t o challenge our thinking about life beyond the Earth. Regarding hab itability, there was even more scientific certainty in other telescopic studies. As early as 1926, photographs were taken in ultraviolet light that cl early showed a substan- tial atmosphere on Mars. Compared with infrared pho tographs taken at the same time, the pictures proved that there is a dens e atmosphere, possibly 40 miles in depth. There are undoubtedly more raref ied layers above this altitude, much like the upper, tenuous atmosphere a round the Earth, that would be too thin to be recorded by photography. It has been suggested that the top of the Martian atmosphere might reach 400 m iles, by the British scientist-writer Earl Nelson, author of There Is Li fe on Mars (1956). The early photographs showing the Martian atmospher e were taken by G. E. Hale of the Mount Palomar Observatory [Southe rn California] and are reproduced in Nelson's book. There are two immediat e and important con- clusions that can be drawn from these observations. The surface gravity on Mars must be substantially higher than has been tau ght, for a low gravity would not be sufficient to retain such a sizable at mosphere. Secondly, with such a dense atmosphere, the sun's energy would int eract much differently than orthodox theories suggested, and the temperatu res on Mars would be considerably warmer, more moderate, and more Earth- like. Although the length of the Martian year is nearly d ouble our 365-day year, the seasons on Mars vary and alternate just like on Earth. When the northern hemisphere is in its summer cycle, the southern hem isphere has its winter. The length of the Martian day is 24 hours and 37 mi nutes, and the inclina- tion of its axis is 25 degrees, which is very close to Earth's 23 degrees. Both the northern and southern polar caps extend ne arly half way to the Martian equator during their respective winters. Wi th the onset of spring in either hemisphere, its ice cap recedes and a wav e of darkening over broad areas spreads slowly towards the equator. Thi s cyclic surface dark- ening was widely considered to be seasonal vegetati on growth as water was liberated from the polar caps. Each polar cap w ill shrink considerably during its respective summer cycle. Sometimes the s outhern polar cap melts completely. The broad areas near the equator, such as Mare Serp entis, Mare Sirenium, and Syrtis Major, change from their winte r shade of brown, to light green and then to dark green. This latter sta ge has often been described as a dark blue-green. Astronomers also no ted that as the seasons"},{"pageNumber":397,"pageContent":"The Suppression of UFO Technologies and Extraterres trial Contact 389 changed to autumn, the colors would gradually turn to yellow and gold, finally returning to brown in winter. (The surface color of Mars is not dark red, as I will prove later.) The parade of colorful seasons was interpreted by o pen-minded as- tronomers as the seasonal growth and ripening of ve getation. Cyclic growth coincided regularly with the natural climati c changes on the plan- et, just as we have here on Earth. I am not discuss ing the canals and their irrigation for crop growing, at the moment. These s easonal changes show- ing cyclic plant life would be taking place even if man were not there on Mars. The presence of vegetation on Mars was held to be a certainty in some quarters, but hotly debated by others. But the way to end all argument was to prove the existence of carbon dioxide, oxygen, a nd the water in the Martian environment, which would indicate that phot osynthesis (the life process) of plants was in fact taking place. Carbon dioxide was there in abundance—even conservative scientists agreed on th at, for it was com- monly speculated that the atmosphere's chief consti tuent was carbon dioxide. Oxygen seemed likely, though it could not be detected in the atmosphere from earth-based studies. The evidence f or oxygen was indi- cated by some regional soil colors, which indicated that certain areas con- tained a large amount of ferrous oxide, or limonite . We have some tropi- cal regions on Earth where the soil is reddish-brow n limonite, and two things are necessary for its formation: abundant ox ygen and extreme humidity in the air. Apparently, oxygen was in the atmosphere of Mars, as the natural product of plant photosynthesis. To briefly explain photosynthesis, it is the biolog ical process by which green plants containing chlorophyll use the energy of sunlight to synthe- size carbohydrates from carbon dioxide and water. S ix molecules of water and six molecules of carbon dioxide are transformed with the aid of solar energy into one molecule of glucose and six molecul es of oxygen. The oxygen is then liberated into the atmosphere. We br eathe in the oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide, which in turn the green plants use in photo- synthesis, and oxygen is returned to the atmosphere . This is Nature's per- fect cycle. If all the green plants were suddenly r emoved from the Earth, all human and animal life would die, because the ox ygen we breathe would not be replenished. The last thing that needed to be confirmed in order to prove the sea- sonal vegetation on Mars, was the existence of wate r. For this evidence it is easiest to jump ahead for a moment to the U.S. V iking project of 1976. The Viking I orbiter photographed extensive ground fog, mists, and cloud rover in the northern hemisphere, and from readings taken by sensitive instruments on the orbiting probe, it was proven on ce and for all, that the"},{"pageNumber":398,"pageContent":"390 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries polar caps were frozen water. 5 If the polar caps were completely melted, it was estimated that the water produced would cove r the entire planet to a depth of about 20 feet. Along with the early ultraviolet photographs showin g a substantial atmosphere, it has been shown that the environmenta l constituents for life exists on Mars. The three basic parameters are carb on dioxide, water, and oxygen—the ferrous oxide soil being the indirect ev idence for oxygen. It is necessary to point to the indirect evidence for oxygen, since NASA refuses to confirm the presence of oxygen in the Ma rtian atmosphere. That is the single remaining ace in their hand. And they keep it, because they know that only the process of photosynthesis by liv ing plants can account for the presence of oxygen in any planet's atmosphe re. During the Viking mission, NASA admitted finding nitrogen, argon, car bon dioxide, and water vapor, although they kept the relative percen tages and overall den- sity out of proportion to the true conditions. But NASA is holding out on the oxygen and will not admit finding it with the V iking probes, because atmospheric oxygen would be recognized by scientist s as positive proof that life exists on Mars. But the remaining evidenc e to be discussed will prove the case. Before the space agency came into existence on Octo ber 1, 1958, sci- entific astronomers at the large observatories were still the experts and authorities on the planets. It seems as though it w as preordained in the heavens that the independent thinkers would have on e last chance to probe the mystery of our neighboring planet, as Mars swun g by in favorable opposition in 1954 and 1956. In its first approach, Mars came within a dis- tance of 39,800,000 miles. The second time, in 1956 , the planet was only 35,120,000 miles away. It would not be that close a gain until 1971, when planetary exploration and pronouncements were in th e hands of NASA. But in 1954 the excitement ran high in astronomical circles, because an international Mars Committee had been formed, to pl an an around the world \"Mars patrol.\" Prominent scientists from seve nteen countries would be coordinating telescopic studies from the world's largest observatories, as Mars made its closest approach in July. Some of the countries involved included the United States, France, Italy, Turkey, India, Japan, Australia, South Africa, Java, Egypt, and Argentina. 6 The international team of scientists was headed by the world's greatest Mars expert, Dr. E. C. Slipher, then the Director o f the Lowell Observatory [Flagstaff, Arizona]. He and most of the committee members were well aware of all the previous astronomical records—the mysterious clouds, flares, markings, radio signals, and the evidence f or canals and vegetation. Some privately believed that there was an intellige nt civilization on Mars, for in 1938, it had been announced that the Lowell Observatory found evi-"},{"pageNumber":399,"pageContent":"The Suppression of UFO Technologies and Extraterres trial Contact 391 dence of changes in the canal system, and the chang es appeared to have been altered by design. This 1954 Mars \"expedition\" was primarily planned to settle the question. It is quite possible that s ome members linked the numerous flying saucer sightings that had been wide ly reported since 1947, to the renewed and intense interest in Mars. Because the government was heavily guarding the UFO evidence, the National Security Agency made it a top priority to use its influence to keep check on the developments of the Mars patrol s tudy. It was impera- tive that planetary speculations and press statemen ts be kept in a totally ambiguous light. The censors were especially concer ned about the Mars patrol because of the caliber of open-minded men wh o were involved with the project. They included Dr. Seymour Hess, a mete orology expert who was on record as having sighted a UFO; Dr. Harold C . Urey, a prominent astrophysicist who was genuinely curious about life on other planets; and Dr. Slipher, who was following in the footsteps of the pioneer Percival Lowell. Dr. Slipher assigned himself to make observ ations from the best location possible—the Lamont Hussey Observatory in South Africa. It had the largest refracting telescope in the souther n hemisphere, and Mars would be passing directly overhead each night durin g opposition. And before the project got underway, Slipher publicly s tated that if he found proof of life on Mars, he would announce it to the world. The Mars Expedition took 20,000 photographs and con firmed the pres- ence of both the canals and vegetation. The canals did not meander at all like a river would; they followed great-circle cour ses, which are the short- est distance between two points on a globe. Many pl anetary astronomers had speculated previously, that if photographs show ed that the canals were along great circle paths, it could be conclude d that they were the work of intelligent beings. The scientists were get ting exceptional pictures also, because the Lowell Observatory was using a ne w electronic camera that could amplify faint markings, and photograph i n one-tenth of a sec- ond to prevent atmospheric turbulence from blurring the details. One canal was found to run straight as an arrow for 1,5 00 miles, something that no natural water channel could do. Dr. Slipher brought enough photographs back from So uth Africa to prove that the canals were real, and man-made. Whil e providing abundant vegetation growth alongside their straight-line cou rses, the canals also proved to be the common link between the green oase s. An intricate pumping system seemed to be the only explanation wh en considering the distances involved. More than 40 canals and 15 oase s were photographed in the first week. 7 But the Mars Committee reports never became public , and they were therefore unknown outside a very limi ted part of the astron- omy community. The new findings were privately logg ed at the observa-"},{"pageNumber":400,"pageContent":"392 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries tories, and sparing details were barely covered in only a few astronomical journals. But everything was kept out of the newspa pers. The government's intelligence agency had succeeded in blocking the Committee's early plans for public reports and pres s conferences. Then they firmly executed their plans for a blackout of real information about Mars. The government keeps itself in control by kee ping a world-wide opinion in control, especially with regard to sensi tive and dramatic issues. Allowing an announcement by an international team o f scientists sug- gesting that Mars was inhabited, would be tantamoun t to the government confirming that UFOs are visiting our planet. So th e censors knew what they had to do. Pressure was put on those who headed the project to furnish no reports to the public press. Though the astronomers studied Mars for five months, only one little statement was given to the public a t the beginning. Dr. Slipher had announced that some new and interesting changes were observed on Mars with their photographic study. Fol lowing that report, there was only silence. All plans for further publi city were blocked, and no worthy Mars Patrol bulletins were ever released. 8 The excuses given out were in the category of \"difficulties in commun ication and coordina- tion, disagreement as to what had been seen and pho tographed, months of studies and review were necessary to properly analy ze, and so on.\" How can any silencing agency of the government achi eve such sup- pression of this, or any other, kind of dramatic in formation? It is difficult to determine for each case just what methods are em ployed, but their forceful persuasion does escalate until the coopera tion is achieved. Pre- sumably, they start out with the position that such information is related to the national security, and that the government i s the entrusted agency to best handle the social implications of confirmed an nouncements. They imply that the public isn't quite ready for this in formation, that the world isn't ready for this information. That the economy isn't prepared for this type of information. They fear that there would be an upheaval in think- ing (although I am certain that it would be an \"upl iftment\" in thinking, and this is the real problem that threatens the censors ). They will say that the public might panic, or they could offer the excuse that there might be an attack from Mars. The possib ilities for persuasive argument are endless, but the only end requirement is that planetary evi- dence be shown as inconclusive, vague, and debatabl e. It has always been maintained officially, that known life does not exi st beyond the Earth, unless possibly it is light years away from us in a nother part of the galaxy. In which case, the distance is so great that our ci vilizations will never meet. After being persuaded to withhold the significant f indings, including the discovery of the great-circle paths of the cana ls, the Mars Committee"},{"pageNumber":401,"pageContent":"The Suppression of UFO Technologies and Extraterres trial Contact 393 only issued a simple press release. Dr. Slipher mad e a statement to the effect that Mars is alive. That certainly satisfied the censors' insistence in keeping things nebulous. (Alive—how? Geologically w ith volcanos, dust storms, and polar cap shrinkage? Or alive in the se nse of intelligent con- structions?) He noted that there were color changes in the Martian geog- raphy that were more interesting than in his previo us observations over the years. But the tiny report was essentially mean ingless, and obviously did not affect public or scientific opinion. The qu estion of Mars might have still been left open, but the orthodox theorie s of inhability were not threatened in the least. It was not until eight years afterwards that notabl e documentation of the 1954 Mars observations was published, in a book tit led The Photographic Story of Mars. Recently, I obtained a copy of this book, and it appears that the publication had a relatively small printing, an d was mainly published to be a reference type of book for science librarie s. Certainly, few in the public would have been inclined to buy such a costl y book, and take it on their own to study an involved scientific text. Yet the answers are there if one wishes to read through complex analyses and car efully worded dis- cussions. The book was written by Dr. Slipher in 19 62, and the full text is based on fifty years of telescopic studies, and tho usands of photographic images taken at the world's largest observatories. The conclusions also referenced the last major finding by astronomy rega rding the Martian environment. During the November 1958 opposition, Dr. William Si nton conduct- ed studies at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observa tory. The scientist- astronomer performed careful infrared scans of the bright desert areas and the dark green oases, and found that the sun's ener gy was absorbed in cer- tain wavelengths over the dark areas, but not over the desert regions. The absorption wavelengths were at 3.43, 3.56, and 3.67 microns*, and these are exactly the same wavelengths absorbed by hydroc arbon compounds. His study proved that there is green plant life on the broad oases of Mars, and that it is organically composed of carbon-hydro gen compounds, the same as our own terrestrial vegetation. In other wo rds, his scientific evi- dence showed that Martian plant life is based on th e same carbon cycle as we find on Earth. But new experimental evidence is never accepted tha t quickly. It is al- ways challenged, and subject to much debate, becaus e old established the- ories are very hard to change. The old theories had predicted that there was no appreciable water or atmosphere on Mars, and tha t the surface tempera- lures were too extreme for vegetation life. (The ca nal evidence also, carried too many implications to be considered acceptable, and was rejected out- * A micron is equivalent to one millionth of a mete r."},{"pageNumber":402,"pageContent":"394 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries right as incompatible with respected establishment theories.) Dr. Sinton's experiments with infrared scans were viewed as inco nclusive, and any such results would have to be confirmed over and over be fore conservative sci- ence would budge. The scientific community much rat her preferred to wait until future space probes settled the questions abo ut Mars. The scientific arguments lingered in limbo, until the government f ormed a space age bureaucracy, called NASA, that could preempt all di scussions on matters of space. The days of independent astronomy speculatin g on planetary condi- tions were soon over. While representing the govern ment in its authoritative role, NASA's position was unassailable—almost. Initially, NASA had three functions: 1. To launch artificial satellites into orbit around t he Earth. 2. To put men into space. 3. To explore the other planetary members of our solar system, including the Moon, with remotely controlled space probes. The first two they did admirably well, and mankind was on the thresh- old of becoming a space civilization. But with the third, NASA did not advance our knowledge towards an age of enlightenme nt. In fact, there is a bitter irony to our space age developments, in th at our authorities led thinking back to the Dark Ages, through distortion and suppression of actual space findings. Long ago, Earth was isolated from the rest of the s ystem, through its ignorance and superstitious thinking. By the twenti eth century, man's intel- ligence had progressed to where he could rationally understand and accept that advanced civilizations do travel space and hav e home planets similar to our Earth. Space visitors traveling in ships whi ch we have termed UFOs were making their existence known at the same time we were reaching technological crossroads in science. But the men of war and all their insti- tutions denied it, and the censors would not allow the confirmation of life beyond the Earth, whether in spaceships or on plane ts. The doors were kept shut by the silence group and vested interests oppo sed to the truth, and NASA then turned out the lights. NASA made out spac e to be an uninter- esting wasteland, devoid of life or recognizable pu rpose. The end result was that mankind on Earth reverted back to an extre me thinking of self- importance, alone in his own egotistical sphere of a world. Had our authorities left a few questions open for b alanced speculations, it would be easier to be less critical. But instead , they determinedly set out to present a completely negative picture of the pla net. A living environ- ment was totally negated without qualification, in order to complement the suppression of UFO evidence. It was apparent th at our planetary prob-"},{"pageNumber":403,"pageContent":"The Suppression of UFO Technologies and Extraterres trial Contact 395 ing was not conducted with any objectivity, right f rom the start. Being a government bureaucracy, NASA had no choice but to s erve the hands of the most powerful economic interests of our present -day world. NASA censors cooperated with the corporate interests tha t demanded the contin- ual coverup and suppression regarding UFOs and thei r origins, and there- fore publicly presented an unrealistic picture of t he planets. The first official flyby of Mars was achieved by Ma riner 4 in July 1965. The probe radioed back twenty-two pictures of the M artian surface, and NASA initially claimed that there were no canals. L ifetimes of telescopic studies were casually obliterated with that one sta tement. A radar occupa- tion reading provided a basis for NASA to declare t hat the atmosphere density on Mars was less than one percent of Earth' s, and another type of signal allowed experts to suggest that the planet h ad no magnetosphere. At its closest distance, Mariner 4 was 6,000 miles from the planet, yet NASA spokesmen claimed readings showing that the av erage surface temperature on Mars was 170°F. The censors may have had a tough time back in the M ars Patrol days curbing speculation, but this was a brand new ballg ame. NASA was the perfect vehicle to paint a lifeless picture bey ond the Earth. Who could possibly challenge statements coming from the U.S. space program? Telescopes or not. UFOs or not. Anybody who still w anted to claim intel- ligent life existed on Mars would be considered a l unatic. The Mariner 4 flyby did not have the capability to realistically confirm habitability. That much can be conceded. But likewi se, the space probe could not realistically confirm those alleged plane tary conditions that were put out as flat statements by the authorities, either. With future plan- etary probes, it became apparent how the censorship was orchestrated, and by whom. The real problem, however, is not with NASA specifi cally. The space agency had practically no choice but to follow the dictates of the power- ful economic interests that control governments and their subordinate agencies. It is these international cartels that ha ve been behind all cen- sorship regarding planetary space. NASA has only be en the publicly- identifiable distorter, regarding space pronounceme nts. So NASA can be partly excused for not being in a po sition to objectively conduct space probe explorations. But false values can never be changed by anything but the truth. And we are at the critic al crossroad of time. Either we become a space civilization, or we will b e a nuclear extinction. REFERENCES 1. Max Miller. Flying Saucers—Fact or Fiction?

Brown Long has Earth's Moon been a source of mystery and puzzlement, as well as an inspiration for love and art. It is also the source of vital [terrestrial] life rhythms. It has been mankind's dream to touch this strange world, for some simply to discover and explore, for others to explo it. It is now pretty much accepted as common knowledge that the U.S. governme nt's NASA has sent manned craft to the Moon, and that they have landed thereon. But wait, not everybody is buying the official story! What's up?

All these books are well worth acquiring to broaden one's out look on this subject. It is a big charge to claim that NASA never went to the Moon, that it was all a fake, yet this man Rene has come up with a large body of infor- mation that has to be seriously considered. He is o bviously not writing this book for the fun of it, I doubt he's making an y money at it, and is sure to be scorned and ridiculed simply for asking good questions which go against the common belief. EVIDENCE OF PICTURES Rene begins with the photographic evidence. The mor e one looks at pho- tos of the Apollo landings, the more one begins to wonder. No blast craters exist under the lunar modules (LEMs), no dust arose from their rocket- softened landings, though the lunar rovers toss dus t into the air as though there were an atmosphere acting on the particles. Q uestions, questions. One important early faked photo is shown here in se quence. Photo 1 is from the book Carrying the Fire by Astronaut Michae l Collins. It shows Collins in a no-gravity test inside an airplane. Ph oto 2 is from the same book and is allegedly of a Gemini 10 space walk. Re ne noticed something fishy about these photos and reversed #1 and sized it so he could overlay it on #2. They match . . . they are the same photo . . . and this is official NASA output! Rene's book shows several other interesting photos which indicate var- ious anomalies. On a splashdown photo of Gemini 6A there is a whip antenna in excellent condition clearly shown, with no burn marks or scorching (5000°F on reentry). No other Gemini had this antenna, and simple logic indicates that it would have burned of f during reentry. Such an antenna is designed for frequencies not used in space. The cover photo on the book shows two lunar astrona uts (or astro-nots as Rene calls them), one reflecting in the other's visor. The reflected astro- naut is not holding a camera, so who took the pictu re with only two [men) on the Moon? Also, in the same photo a piece of wha t appears to be scaf- folding with a spotlight on it appears on the left edge of the photo. I've seen this same photo in several other places, but i t is always cropped so the scaffolding is missing. My favorite of the photo anomalies in the book is s hown here as Photo"},{"pageNumber":407,"pageContent":"The Suppression of UFO Technologies and Extraterres trial Contact 399 3, which Rene has titled \"Mutt and Jeff.\" The anoma ly in this photo is obvious. This is a photo of Armstrong, holding the staff, and Aldrin, hold- ing the flag. While the two astronauts are basicall y the same height, the shadow of Armstrong is about 75 percent the length of Aldrin's. The shad- ows are not parallel as they should be, but converg e, indicating two sources of light. Rene used trigonometry to discove r that Aldrin's person- al source of illumination is at 26.4 degrees of alt itude, while Armstrong's is at 34.9 degrees. The sun was at 13.5 degrees alt itude on the real Moon, so where were these guys? Certainly not where we ha ve been led to believe. Perhaps a soundstage in the American deser t? NASA allegedly shot tens of thousands of pictures o f the lunar land- ings, yet it is very difficult to procure even a de cent percentage of these, and the same ones show up in most publications. The television footage of the first Moon landing was very poor. While havi ng access to the finest of technology, NASA would not allow a direct feed o f the footage, but forced networks and news services to film through a n optically enlarged television screen, adding quite a bit of distortion . During the Apollo 16 lunar lift-off the camera followed the ship up off the surface. No one was left on the Moon, so who panned the camera? NASA la ter claimed that the camera was radio controlled from Earth, but how cou ld they have fol- lowed the ship so closely given the transmission ti me lag ... ? The Spacey Twins. NASA used the same photo twice, p erhaps to cut expenses?"},{"pageNumber":408,"pageContent":"400 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries Photo 3. Mutt & Jeff However, other lunar photos not mentioned by Rene, but appearing in some of the other previously mentioned books, indic ate movement and structure on the Moon. One well known photo (Photo 4), shot from an unmanned orbiter, which has even appeared in Nation al Geographic, shows \"boulders\" rolling, allegedly from a moonquak e. However, basic scrutiny shows that they are rolling up and down hi ll. Lesser known pho- tographs show these same \"boulders\" on other areas of the Moon making identical track marks. Photo 5 is from National Geo graphic, September 1973, and was shot by the crew of Apollo 17. A clos e-up shot of this same boulder has appeared in a recent issue of Nexus mag azine, October- November 1995, which shows it to be the same cylind rical shape with arms as the larger rolling boulder of Photo 4. Domed and pointed building-like structures appear i n craters. These have been written off as lava bubbles or geological responses to the impacts causing the craters, even though the physic al evidence goes against them being impact craters (the rim heights are similar regardless of crater diameter). Photo 6 is an enlarged section of a photo of the crater Kepler which appeared in the February 1969 National Geographic. It looks to me like there is an artificial complex in Kepler. Fred Steckling has a blowup of this structure in his book. While Rene has shown some serious problems with the lunar photos, mostly those of the astronauts on the Moon, he does n't show any of the boulder or dome photos.

If one were to add up all the astronauts' stated ob servations of the appearance of space above the atmosphere one would come to the conclusion that they were either crazy, incompetent, or they never went, or, perhaps some of them were lying?

This was from the period from Sheppard on to Skylab. I later spok e with John Bartoe who was up on an early shuttle flight and he laughed at this, said he couldn't believe that anyone in NASA would say that because he was in space and the stars were brighter than they are on Earth! (Th ey must have slipped him a working diffraction grating.) I called back m y contact in NASA and he told me, \"Sir, the astronaut is a trained observ er and is reporting what he saw, but the information I gave you (about the b lackness of space) was essentially correct.\" I spoke with the man who deve loped the film for NASA for twenty-five years and he told me that the astronauts weren't even sure if they could see the sun, that it may ha ve been the appearance of the sun on their windows! The fact is that there are no visible light photogr aphs of the sun, the stars, or any planets (other than the Earth and Moo n, and not including specific probes sent to those planets) available in any NASA photo cata- log. The fact that no stars appear on any photos wa s one of the main pil- lars of evidence for Bill Kaysing's book. Rene is t he source of the astro- nauts' quotes as above and feels that there must be some serious problem with this selective star-blindness. As there is no definite answer available to us right now as to whether or not we can see the stars in space, I would have to say that we cannot base our conclusion as t o the validity of the Apollo flights on the evidence of the appearance (o r nonappearance) of stars in NASA photos. THERMAL PROBLEMS Space is supposed to be at absolute zero. Anything directly in the sunshine heats up incredibly. Skylab overheated when one of its solar panels failed to deploy properly, yet Apollo 13, in direct sunlig ht and in a lethal radia- tion zone, supposedly got cold! On the launch pad t he ship is air condi- tioned from ground services. In space the ship is a ir conditioned (powered by fuel cells), if you turn off that air conditione r the ship gets cold! At least that is what NASA's line of logic dictates. A pollo 17's LEM sat on the Moon in the direct sun for 75 hours straight. W ithout massive power and refrigeration units the only way to cool the LE M would have been with the explosive cooling of water. Many tons woul d have been neces- sary for that time period. The astronauts reported that the LEMs were \"too cold to sleep in.\" How cold would your closed car b e after 75 hours of direct sunlight (or even 1 hour)? The life support backpacks that the astronauts wore were supposed to COOL them on the lunar s u r f a c e by discharging water from a blowhole. Conservative calculation of the water necessary to accomplish this, given"},{"pageNumber":412,"pageContent":"404 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries standard metabolic heat and solar radiation, indica tes that the backpacks had to be filled 40 percent with water, allowing ro om also for an oxygen bottle, carbon dioxide scrubber, dehumidifier, wate r bladder for the cool- ing circuit and one for dump water, a heat exchange r, a radio monitoring bodily function, a communications radio with power to reach Houston, and a battery to power all this. Also, for the cool ing to be functioning, the water had to be ejected from the blowhole regularly . This would have created the effect of a fountain spewing minute cry stals of water, quite a tremendous photo opportunity NASA seemed to have mi ssed on tens of thousands of photos. NASA's own cutaway drawing of the backpack shows a water storage capacity of about .43 gallons , almost enough for 27 minutes of operation at the impossible efficiency o f 100 percent. NASA claims 4 hours of operation. ODD FIT With the backpacks on, the astronauts would need ab out 35 inches of clearance to crawl through the 30-inch hatch on the LEM (lunar [excur- sion] module) in the manner claimed by NASA. Awful tight fit! After getting back in the LEM the astronauts \"repre ssurized their cabin.\" Then [according to NASA] \"they removed thei r boots, slipped out of the backpacks heavy with life-support equipment that had kept them alive on the Moon, reopened the hatch, and dumped t hem along with crumpled food packages and filled urine bags onto t he surface\" (Apollo 11). There is no airlock on the LEM, how did they o pen the door after repressurization and dump their suits and garbage w ithout dying from the supposed vacuum and heat (or was that cold)? SPACE RADIATION Van Allen radiation belts and solar flares create d eadly radiation in space.* NASA spacecraft were not shielded against t his. Apollos 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 flew during the peak of solar cycle 20, w ith large flares occur- ring during the flights. All those astronauts would have received many hundreds or thousands of times the LIFETIME radiati on limits for nuclear energy workers. A Supersonic Transport (SST) must d rop altitude when it gets a dosage of 10 millirems, at 100 millirems it must alter its flight plan. 170 millirems is dangerous and almost guarantees ca ncer in the future. * ... the radiation was first predicted by Nikola T esla around the beginning of this century as the result of experimental and theoretical work he had done on electricity in space in general and the electrical charge of the Sun in particular. He tried then to tell our academic natural philosophers (scientists) that the Sun had a fantas tic electrical charge and that it must generate a solar wind. But to no avail. . . . Subsequent study showed that this belt, or belts, [ begins] in near space about 500 miles out and extends out to over 15,000 miles... Van All en belt radiation is dependent upon the solar wind and is said to focus or concentrate that radia tion."},{"pageNumber":413,"pageContent":"The Suppression of UFO Technologies and Extraterres trial Contact 405 During Apollo 14 and 16 the solar flares would have given the astronauts approximately 75 rem (not millirems!). In an articl e in National Geographic, \"Chernobyl—One Year Later\" it says: \"In general, 5 rem is considered acceptable for a nuclear-plant employee in a year, with 25 rem (the total countenanced for Chernobyl cleanup workers) an allo wable once-in-a- lifetime dose.\" The walls of the spacecraft were \"p aper thin\" and the fab- ric suits had no radiation shielding built in, anyw ay only very thick lead or a large measure of water (approximately 6 feet o f shielding mass) will reduce the radiation of solar flares to anywhere cl ose to safe levels. How did NASA protect the astronauts against this deadly radiation? The words \"Space Radiation\" appear extremely rarely, if at al l, in books about manned space flights. Russian scientists told astro nomer Bernard Lovell that they know of no way to shield from radiation o utside the Van Allen radiation belts. OUTRIGHT MURDER? Shortly before the 1967 test-pad fire that killed t hree astronauts (Grissom, White and Chaffee) Virgil Grissom told his wife, Be tty, \"If there is ever a serious accident in the space program, it's likely to be me.\" He had become a critic of the Space Program and had expres sed unease about the success of actually getting men on the Moon. The de cision to run this test with pure oxygen at pressure was nothing short of m oronic—it created a calorimetric bomb which was set off by the astronau ts being told to flip switches that caused tiny sparks. Immediately after the test-pad fire, before anyone was notified, government agents raide d Grissom's home and took all his personal papers. When they returne d his papers to his widow his personal diary and all papers containing the word \"Apollo\" were missing! Five other astronauts died in \"accidents\" that same year. Before the first Apollo manned mission left the launch pad eleven as tronauts had died in \"accidents,\" Grissom, White and Chaffee in the caps ule fire, Freemen, Basset, See, Rogers, Williams, Adams and Lawrence d ied in airplane rashes (remember these were the world's best pilots flying their private aircraft, government supplied [jet] trainers—very s afe craft) and Givens was killed in a car crash. In 1970 Taylor died in a plane crash. CONCLUSION There is no doubt that Rene has opened a can of wor ms with NASA Mooned America!. It is a challenge to us researcher s to check out his information.

I agree with most of his information, some of his figuring is beyond my technical"},{"pageNumber":414,"pageContent":"406 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries grasp, and some things I don't agree with, such as his claim that the lunar footprints could only be made in wet soil. I have m ade very clear foot- prints in fine, dry desert dust, and I have used th em as a guide on returns from the wilderness. I agree that many photos have been faked, that the information doesn't add up, and that NASA will go t o great lengths, even murder, to cover up whatever is really happening. I think, and have so for a long time, that there is and has been for centuri es, perhaps millennia, intelligent activities occurring on, and perhaps be low, the surface of the Moon. I may be wrong, and I admit that possibility, but there is a tremen- dous body of information to back up my belief. As far as NASA is concerned, I think that it is jus t a dog-and-pony show, while the real space program goes on behind t he scenes. All of the authors mentioned in this review can be likened to the six blind men and the elephant. They all have an important piece of t he puzzle which is being hidden from us. Let's put those pieces togeth er and work towards a clear picture. It is hard to make a definite conclusion with all t his conflicting infor- mation. What is being covered up? It is possible, g iven the light of Rene's information on radiation and thermal problems that NASA never went to the Moon. However, there has been quite a bit of ac tivity noticed on the Moon since the discovery of the telescope, and unma nned missions have sent back photos of boulders, obelisks and domes. P erhaps robot craft were landed and sent the photos necessary to fake t he backgrounds of the manned missions, or perhaps there is another answer : That there is an advanced technology being used in space that us mer e mortals have no access to. We can speculate that antigravity drives would create a protec- tive field (like a personal Van Allen belt) which w ould shield those inside the craft from deadly radiation. If so, then manned missions may well have been undertaken, but for some reason or anothe r NASA still felt the need to fake some of the informational output. All we can say for sure is that we Never Get a Straight Answer!"},{"pageNumber":415,"pageContent":"Section IV The Suppression of Fuel Savers and Alternate Energy Resources A chemical war has been declared on our planet. As a species, we are at the end of our grace period, and we can no longer a fford to spew out tox- ins from our industrial plants, and filth from our cars and trucks. If we are to somehow survive and carry on into the next centu ry, to preserve a healthy planet for the future generations, we must conserve our resources. Better still, we must rely on alternate, clean form s of energy. You need to look only as far as your driveway to fi nd evidence of our abuse of existing energy resources. Conventional ca rburetion and fuel injection introduce a fine mist of gasoline droplet s into the combustion chamber of your car. Some of this mist is vaporized , and that is what pro- pels the pistons down their cylinders, driving the car along. But droplets merely burn—a waste of rapidly depleting fuel resou rces—and hydrocar- bon and carbon monoxide emissions are the result. T rue vaporization is the answer to ridding the air of these poisons. Charles Pogue knew that the most explosive part of gasoline is its vapor, and so invented a system that would induct t he vapor from the air space above the fuel in a gasoline tank. He was thu s able to get more than 200 miles per gallon on two-ton cars with eight-cyl inder engines. Pogue held three basic patents for vaporizing carburetors he developed for General Motors in the 1930s. With such an outstanding outco me, one would think that these devices would be standard on today's aut omobiles. Unfortunately for us, Pogue's facilities were destr oyed in the late 1930s and he was wounded by gunfire in incidents th at persuaded him to forego further development of h i s invention. How ever, the fundamen- tal concept lives on in various forms. Honda cars, for example, now have"},{"pageNumber":416,"pageContent":"408 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries sophisticated vaporizing technology enabling high m ileage performance. In 1998 Mitsubishi announced the introduction of si milar \"lean burn\" technology that involved vaporizing the fuel. Altho ugh none of these modern adaptations go as far as Pogue and some of h is contemporaries, Future Perfect Ltd. of Auckland, New Zealand, is cu rrently marketing an aftermarket vapor device that reputedly cuts hydroc arbon pollution by 60 percent. So it is possible for us to use our fuel resources responsibly and eco- nomically. But this does not alter the reality that , despite our best efforts at conservation, our energy supplies are finite. Th us we must seek out abundant resources. And, truth be known, we have th e technology to har- ness these resources for a cleaner, safer environme nt. However, since the early years of this century, pow er and petroleum companies have been resolute in their denial that a lternate energy resources exist. When faced with irrefutable proof, they have been even more resolute in their efforts to suppress devices that would all ow us to harness this ener- gy. The power of these corporations is such that, t oday, neither free energy nor hydrogen have a place in a world reliant on fos sil fuels. Science, far from being value-free or disinterested , as it likes to portray itself publicly, has always been an advocate for th e dominant system in which it has an important stake. If the current fos sil-fuel economy were to be disbanded, funds for pet research projects would rapidly disappear. Because alternate energy researchers are a perceive d threat to the organi- zations which provide research funds, unconventiona l energy devices do not and cannot work, or are doomed as quackery—\"in scientific opinion.'' Take, for example, the free energy idea, which cont ends that the earth is floating on (or in) a sea of energy. Space is no t the vacuum that some would have our students believe in science classes. It is a veritable sea of energy. Indeed the very term \"space\" is almost a de ad giveaway for the message that establishment science wishes to create . In reality, it is not as though matter has been created ex nihilo, it is tha t matter is created out of this sea of energy. Nikola Tesla and Henry Moray were inventors who act ually designed and built machinery that tapped into the free energ y of space and har- nessed it to drive electric motors, operate radios, and light electric light bulbs. Lester Hendershot invented a generator power ed by the earth's magnetic field that achieved similar results. Like so many other inventors trying to make alternate energy a viable option, th ese men lacked \"scien- tific\" training, and worked independently in their small workshops. Scientists working for the establishment endeavored to discredit them, rationalizing along the lines that, as the inventor s were not learned in aca- demic science, they could not know what they were d oing."},{"pageNumber":417,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Fuel Savers and Alternate Energy Resources 409 But suppression has not been limited only to free e nergy inventions. It extends to cover research into hydrogen as an energ y resource as well. Francisco Pacheo successfully powered a car and a b oat with the hydro- gen energy of seawater. Martin Fleischmann and Stan ley Pons shocked the scientific community when they announced that t hey had fused two hydrogen nuclei in a jar of heavy water. So it seem s that water can be- come the major fuel for the world. That's because when water's two constituent gases, hydrogen and oxy- gen, are combined with a spark they explode with tr emendous force, pro- ducing super-abundant quantities of energy that is totally non-polluting. Then they recombine to form water. They can also be made to burn with a controlled flame for welding torches; for cooking ; for steam generation; for power. The media never shows you an exploding gasoline sto rage tank and editorializes that gasoline is an extremely dangero us fuel. But with hydro- gen the dominant association foisted on the people is the Hindenberg \"dis- aster.\" We are never told about the probable sabota ge of a dirigible that was built with German thoroughness for detail and s afety by people who were knowledgeable about the properties of hydrogen ; nor it is ever real- ly stressed that thanks to the fact that hydrogen i s so incredibly light most of the explosion went up instead of engulfing the g ondola ... and most of the passengers actually survived the blast. We are at the most crucial time in recorded history in terms of not only our survival but our fulfillment as an intelligent, compassionate, and cre- ative species. It is only now—when the need for a g lobal transformation in energy usage is dire—that this technology is abs olutely necessary. If necessity is the mother of invention, perhaps we ca n hope that it is also the mother of the invention's general acceptance."},{"pageNumber":418,"pageContent":"Nikola Tesla: A Brief Introduction Jonathan Eisen Nikola Tesla was arguably the greatest inventive ge nius of the twentieth century, perhaps the greatest at least as far back as Leonardo da Vinci. What a shame and an indictment on our educational i nstitutions that his name enlists barely a mention here and there in the hallways of learning. When pressed, electrical engineers, who in fact owe their livelihood to Tesla, will tell you that Tesla invented alternatin g current and the \"Tesla coil\" which they play around with every so often when the y have to. But they will probably not be able to tell you anything about his other 700 basic patents. Or his ability to fetch electricity from the ambien t atmosphere. Or his conclusion that the earth itself is a capacitor, an d his experiments with transmitting electricity around the globe to virtua lly anywhere. Or his invention of the radio (well before Marconi), X-ray s, the transistor and countless other inventions so far ahead of the time s that even today they are still virtually unknown. Even so, his bladeless turbine does seem to be maki ng something of a comeback. And the Tesla Society is trying to intere st the world in reviv- ing some of his other lost inventions. He was convi nced that \"free ener- gy\" is a fact, rather than mere speculation, and ov er the years he has become something of a magnate for people working in the field. Tesla's legacy is well known to a small-but-growing group of interest- ed scientists and researchers. His astonishing stor y is recounted still: How he tore up his contract with Westinghouse in order for his alternating cur- rent electrification of America to proceed; how he had the rug pulled out from under him by J. P. Morgan when it looked as th ough his Colorado Springs experiments showed that wireless electricit y transmission was feasible; how his Wardenclyffe tower on Long Island was destroyed when it seemed that his new system was about to supplant his old AC system, making free electricity available to everyone."},{"pageNumber":419,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Fuel Savers and Alternate Energy Resources 411 What a tragedy that a genius of such magnitude shou ld die broke in his room at The New Yorker Hotel.

Nikola Tesla (1856-1943) Colorado Springs, International Tesla Symposium, Ju ly, 1988—The man sitting next to me was in tears, shaking with q uiet hiccuping sobs as if trying to be unobtrusive. He was rotund and wore thick glasses, but oth- erwise there was little to distinguish his appearan ce from that of two hun- dred other electrical engineers and other Tesla fan s in the convention hall, still attentive to the scientist who had addressed them so eloquently and was leaving the podium. It was not difficult to figure out why the man besi de me was moved emotionally. The guest speaker, astrophysicist Adam Trombly, seemed to have choreographed his talk to lead to the moment. First he warmed up his audience by praising their hero. He reminded th em that Nikola Tesla was the turn-of-the-century genius who fathered alt ernating current tech- nologies, radar, flourescent tubes, and bladeless t urbines. Tesla also pre- sented the first viable arguments for robots, rocke ts, and particle beams. If society had followed up on the inventions Nikola Tesla envisioned at the turn of the century as he rode in a carriage ne ar what is now this hotel, said Trombly, \"we wouldn't have a fossil-fuel econo my today. And J. P. Morgan, Rockefeller and a number of others wouldn't have amassed extraordinary fortunes on the basis of that fossil fuel economy.\" FREE ENERGY FROM \"VACUUM\" OE SPACE Trombly added that if Tesla's vision had prevailed, we would be dipping into a clean and abundant energy, like taking water from the well of space."},{"pageNumber":421,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Fuel Savers and Alternate Energy Resources 413 After all, the theoretical basis for vacuum energy is now part of the phy- sics literature: . . . Not just in the literature of the fringe; it' s been in Physical Review since 1975, Review of Modern Physics since 1962, an d in European physics literature since the early 50s. Harold Puth off in his May 1987 article in Physical Review D pointed out that in or der for the hydrogen atom in its ground state not to collapse, it had to be absorbing energy from the vacuum. The astrophysicist saw this scientific work as furt her vindication of Tesla. Trombly said that in the nineteenth century Tesla p rophesied that peo- ple would someday hook their machinery up to \"the v ery wheelworks of nature\"—the energy of vacuum space. Trombly noted that electrons themselves must sponta neously appear out of the background field of energy, or \"we would have to invoke a rather Neanderthal concept that everything had its start in a certain mo- ment.\" The speaker paused as if to let the audience catch his sarcasm, then added, \"because we have embraced this [Big Bang] co smology for the last couple of decades, we have some real problems.\" In contrast, Trombly said, a more advanced cosmolog y sees everything as a modification of an energy-rich background fiel d. Our physical bodies are relatively insignificant modifications of that field. The field itself has a potential energy equivalence, in grams, of 10-to- the-94th power grams per cubic centimetre. The human body, in comparison , has a gram equiv- alent of only about one gram per cubic centimeter. That means that the background energy is 10 (wish 94 zeros after the te n) times more energy- rich than our physical bodies. THE PLAN: TELL ROOSEVELT It's a lot of energy, Trombly said. Why not invent a pocket size device which could tap a kilowatt of this space energy? It could \"just kind of scrape the surface, ever so slightly\" of the 10-to- the-94th-power grams per cubic centimeter supply of energy. \"That's what Nikola Tesla was scheduled to tell Fra nklin Delano Roosevelt in 1943. In 1943 he proposed to FDR that perhaps we should look carefully at the fact that we can get all the energy we need from any space we happen to be in. \"He didn't show up for the meeting; he was found de ad in his apart- ment— 'natural causes.'\" The speaker added quietly that despite the official statement on the cause of death, then is some suspicion that Tesla's paranoia about what he ate was more premonition than paranoia. Trombly then related an"},{"pageNumber":422,"pageContent":"414 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries incident which fueled this suspicion. He had given a speech at the Univer- sity of Toronto, Canada, for the 1981 conference on Non-Conventional Energy. Afterward, an older gentleman with a heavy New York accent came up to Trombly and said he had been a detective at the time Nikola Tesla was found dead, and had been involved in the investigation. The old man had produced vintage credentials to show Trombl y that he had indeed been a detective. The man appeared to be old enough to have been an adult in 1943. In a soft voice Trombly said that the old man had s aid that \"for nation- al security reasons no one was to know that the cor oner's report showed that Tesla was poisoned.\" A shocked silence descended on the Colorado Springs meeting room when the Tesla Society heard this, coming from a ph ysicist who would not lightly risk his reputation by relating such a stor y. The silence lifted as the audience honored Trombly with applause at the end o f his speech. To understand why Tesla's story—the life of a dead inventor—can so grip the emotions of yet another generation of tech nophiles, we need to look at some highlights. TESLA'S LEGACY Tesla was a witty, elegantly-dressed loner, at the height of his fame in the late 1800s when the world knew he had invented the whole system of alternating current (AC) electrical generation and distribution which lit up the cities. But that was barely the beginning of hi s productivity. Born in 1856 in the rural village of Smiljan in wha t became Yugoslavia, Nikola Tesla in his boyhood went from the highs of mystical commun- ion with nature to the lows of suffering with chole ra and the loss of his older brother. His father was a minister who wrote poetry and his mother a storyteller with a photographic memory. She was a lso an inventor of do- mestic laborsaving devices. Nikola showed his true direction from an early age; at the age of five he invented a unique bladeless waterwheel and place d the little model in a creek. The child also built a motor powered by si xteen live June bugs. His father was not impressed. He insisted that Niko la would follow fam- ily tradition and be a clergyman, so he began his s on's education at a young age with rigorous mental exercises. When he was of legal age, Nikola managed to get his father's permis- sion to study engineering instead of the ministry. After he completed his studies at the Austrian Polytechnic School in Graz and then in 1880 at the University of Prague, he worked for a European tele phone company and upgraded their technology. Meanwhile, a more difficult challenge which he had shouldered in his"},{"pageNumber":423,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Fuel Savers and Alternate Energy Resources 415 college days was always with him; he was determined to improve the electrical motor and dynamo. Dynamos naturally make alternating cur- rent, the type of electric flow which continually c hanges directions. Tesla intuitively felt that it should be possible to run a motor on AC electricity and eliminate the inefficient sparking of brushes f rom a commutator. His theory went against textbook knowledge in those ear ly days of electrifi- cation, when direct current (DC) was considered the only type of current that would run motors. MAGNETIC WHIRLWIND Despite ridicule from his engineering professor, Te sla maintained that there had to be a better way. He worked so intensely on t his and other engineer- ing problems that his health broke down. While Tesl a recuperated, a friend who was a master mechanic and an athlete took him f or long walks through Budapest. In February of 1882 one day while they walked in a park, Tesla was inspired by the setting sun. To his amazement, that is when he made a breakthrough to answering the techni cal challenge of making a workable AC electrical system to turn a mo tor. He was reciting lines from the German poet Goethe's Faust: The glow retreats, done is the break of toil; It yonder hastes, new fields of life exploring. Ah, that no wing can lift me from the soil, Upon its track to follow, follow soaring! Tesla was stopped in his tracks by a vivid vision. It was as if a 3-D holographic picture of a rotating magnetic field wa s in motion in front of his eyes and he could reach out and put his hands i nto it. He saw how the field—a magnetic whirlwind—was produced by alternat ing currents out of step with each other. He saw separate coils of w ire, arranged as four segments of a circle. The first alternating current would energize a coil creating an electromagnetic field which attracted t he magnet and then faded. The second overlapping current would feed th e next coil and drag the magnet around further and then fade and so on. He saw it as a process similar to the sun traveling around and \"giving lif e wherever she goes.\" Speechless, Tesla waved his arms in excitement. His buddy tried to lead him to a nearby bench, but Tesla grabbed a stick to draw a diagram in the dust. \"See my motor here! Watch me reverse it,\" Tesla blu rted out. His friend was afraid that Tesla had lost his mind. Tesla was indeed in another world at that moment. As he watched his vision move, he s aw the electrical prin- ciple that later made the twentieth century operate ."},{"pageNumber":424,"pageContent":"416 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries His rotating magnetic field would not only mean a b etter motor, it would revolutionize the electrical industry. He mapped ou t refinements of the idea with several or even five overlapping currents at a time—the basis of a polyphase transmission system. But first he had to convince someone to finance the development of these world-changing inv entions. A stepping- stone to that goal was a job in Paris later that ye ar, where he attracted the attention of the Continental Edison Company by his successes as a trou- bleshooter who fixed their dynamos. Another step wa s to demonstrate the first induction motor for the mayor of Strassburg. The mayor had invited wealthy potential investors to the demonstration, b ut they failed to compre- hend Tesla's vision of a future for the brushless m otor. DITCHDIGGER TO MILLIONAIRE Surely it would be welcomed in America, Tesla thoug ht. At twenty-eight years of age he was ready to make his move to the l and of opportunity, where he expected that his great discovery would be quickly developed for humanity's use. Before Tesla left Paris, one of his bosses at Continental Edison handed him a letter introducing him to the famous inventor Thomas Alva Edison. \"I know two great men and you are one of them; the other is this young man,\" the letter read. When Tesla stepped off the ship in New York on June 6, 1884, he only had four pennies in his pocket, because he had been robbed on the way to the ship. But he did not at all resemble the stereo typical impoverished immigrant; he wore a bowler hat and stylish coat, a nd his posture was aris- tocratic. He still had the letter of introduction t o Thomas Edison. Edison, then age thirty-seven, had already proven h is ability as a busi- nessman as well as inventor. He was a hero to Tesla at first. The polite European admired Edison's accomplishments—discoveri es made by trial- and-error and with only grade-school level of forma l education. Tesla ignored his rough manners. But Edison on the other hand repudiated Tesla's theory on how to work with AC electricity; Edison used DC in his electric lamps and had invested all his efforts in DC technologies. Tesla was put to work repairing and improving Ediso n's DC dynamos and motors on board a ship. He also won Edison's gr udging respect by working eighteen-hour days in Edison's Manhattan wo rkshop, seven days a week, and by conquering difficult technical probl ems. One day Tesla described how he could improve the ef ficiency of Edison's dynamo, and Edison reportedly replied, \"Th ere's fifty thousand dollars in it for you if you can do it.\" The Europe an immigrant worked tirelessly—thirty-two hours in one stretch. After m onths of work, the new machines were tested and found to measure up, and E dison prepared to"},{"pageNumber":425,"pageContent":" The Suppression of Fuel Savers and Alternate Energy Resources 417 profit from his improved dynamo. When Tesla went to the boss and asked for the promised $50,000 bonus, however, Edison wou ld not pay. \"Tesla,\" he said, \"you don't understand our America n humor.\" Nikola Tesla had a well-developed sense of humor, b ut when someone reneged on a verbal deal he was not amused. He walk ed out, and into a job on a crew digging ditches with pick and shovel. Two years later Tesla's luck changed; he had the op portunity to devel- op his \"polyphase system\" of AC and patented the AC motor, generator and transformer. By 1891, Tesla had forty patents o n his AC induction motor and polyphase system. An industrialist and inventor of the railroad air b rake, George Westinghouse of Pittsburgh, helped Tesla to change history. Westinghouse, a stocky, adventurous man with a walrus mustache, s hared Tesla's vision of a power system that could harness hydroelectric res ources such as Niagara Falls and could send high-voltage electricity on wi res over vast distances. He bought all of Tesla's patents on the polyphase A C system, and signed a contract to pay Tesla a million dollars cash, plus royalties of $2.50 per horsepower produced by the system. Tesla thought he would never have to worry about money again; he could invent to his heart's content. HIGH STAKES One of the first challenges that Westinghouse and T esla faced together was what was called the War of the Currents—the AC/ DC battle. It was a time when America's power grid had not yet been bui lt but DC proponents were nevertheless becoming an entrenched interest g roup stubbornly lighting the use of alternating current (AC) for ge nerating, sending and using electricity. Thomas Edison led the opposition . His own inventions used direct current (DC). However, DC does not trav el well. To give peo- ple electrical lights, heat and other uses of the c urrent, a power plant had to be built for every square mile served. At the en d of a mile of DC power line, light bulbs barely glowed. Skyscrapers and th eir elevators would have been impossible to build if Edison's views had won. Tesla knew that AC was the better system for electr ical distribution; it could easily travel for hundreds of miles down very slender wires at high pressures (high voltage) and then transformers coul d reduce the voltage for household use. In the War of the Currents, most of the casualties were animals. During the time that Edison gave speeches defending the me rits of DC over AC, the neighborhood around his New Jersey laboratory w as mysteriously los- ing dogs and cats. Throughout 1887 Edison or his st aff grabbed animals off the street by day, and at night invited reporters a nd other guests to watch what happened when an unsuspecting dog was pushed o nto a tin sheet and"},{"pageNumber":426,"pageContent":"418 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries electrocuted with high voltages—using the Tesla/Wes tinghouse AC cur- rent, of course. Edison refered to electrocuting as \"Westinghousing.\" Carrying on this strategy of linking AC with electr ocution and death, the Edison camp distributed scare pamphlets warning that Westinghouse wanted to put this deadly AC current into every Ame rican home. However, Edison omitted the fact that the current w ould first be reduced in voltage. Through this disinformation campaign, E dison was determined to sway the public toward his DC technology, ineffi cient as it was. To answer accusations against the safety of AC, Tes la in turn developed showmanship; he proved that he could conduct AC thr ough his own body without ill effects. He stood on a platform in whit e tie and tails and cork- bottomed shoes. Bolts of electricity crackled and s napped, and he allowed several hundred thousand volts to dance over his bo dy and light the bulbs in his hands. However, although the voltage (pressu re) of the electricity was high, he reduced the amperage (quantity) and us ed high frequencies. That type of electrical current crawls over a body and therefore doesn't reach vital organs. As an argument against Edison i t was cheating, because domestic AC switches back and forth on a co nductor 60 times a second, not thousands of times as in high frequenci es. Edison, however, played dirtier. He persuaded state prison authorities to kill a death-row prisoner with AC current instea d of executing him by hanging. It was a further attempt to popularize the phrase \"to Westinghouse\" as a replacement for \"to electrocute.\" Prison offic ials miscalculated the amount of current needed to kill the condemned man, and newspaper reporters witnessed a messy smoky execution. Despite Edison's efforts, Tesla and Westinghouse wo n the Battle of the Currents. In 1892 Westinghouse built an AC system f or lighting the 1893 world fair in Chicago. TYCOONS PUT SQUEEZE ON WESTINGHOUSE A big hydroelectric project was the second major vi ctory for AC support- ers; in 1895 Tesla's first generating unit was put into operation at Niagara Falls. Eventually, Tesla's distribution system deli vered immense amounts of electrical power across the continent. Since Wes tinghouse had signed a contract giving Tesla $2.50 per horsepower, Tesla c ould have died as a multibillionaire. \"Morganization\" intervened, however, with cut-throa t practices direct- ed against George Westinghouse. Business competitor s in the real-life game of Monopoly tried to squeeze him out of the po wer picture and gave him an ultimatum: \"get rid of your contract with Te sla or you're finished.\" When Westinghouse laid his cards in front of Tesla and admitted to being in financial trouble, Tesla demonstrated his priori ties. He remembered that"},{"pageNumber":427,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Fuel Savers and Alternate Energy Resources 419 Westinghouse had believed in him and had invested i n the new AC patents when others had not had such courage. Therefore, so that Westinghouse would survive financially and the technology would be developed, Tesla took a cash settlement and walked away from the mil lions of future dol- lars assigned to him by the per-horsepower deal. He tore up the lucrative contract in order to help a friend. Meanwhile, the power monopolists were poised to gra b as much money as possible. When Tesla's inventions made it possible to send elec- trical power from huge waterfalls across the states , tycoons prepared to make fortunes in utility companies. These captains of industry wanted the 60-cycle-per- second AC power system to continue to grow and cover the earth with power poles, transformers and wires. Tra nsmission towers would march up and down mountainsides and across de serts. Power com- panies would dam rivers for hydro power and make th e people pay for every watt sent over the companies' copper wires. T he power magnates did not want the inventor to uproot this growing fo rest of money trees. J. Pierpont Morgan pulled the strings that formed t he huge company General Electric, for example, and had already boug ht up copper mines knowing that transmission wires would eventually cr isscross every indus- trialized continent. But Tesla was a discoverer, not a business shark. H is new plan was wireless transmission of energy—free energy for any one who sticks a tuned receiver into the ground while Tesla's tuned transmitter was res- onating frequencies! The financiers on Wall Street didn't catch the drif t of Tesla's \"wireless\" talk right away. The plan was so futuristic that it was literally over every- one's head. But he was giving enough clues for anyo ne who had been ready to catch his vision. In the same year that th e lighting of the World's Fair dazzled society, he talked about \"earth resona nce\" at a lecture to the prestigious Franklin Institute. Earth resonance was part of his vision for wireless power. The secret is sending out the corre ct frequency—speed of vibration—with electrical pulses. Just as a piano s tring will vibrate when another instrument at a distance hits the same note as its tuned frequency, wireless receivers would resonate with the transmit ter frequencies. The power would be tuned in just like you tune in a rad io station. Some Tesla researchers also believe that he could have resonat ed the cavity between the ionosphere and the ground. Just like the cavity within a violin, this spherical Schumann cavity has its own resonant freq uency. Disregarding the danger of making his own previous inventions obso- lete, in the next few years he thought up the proce sses necessary for futur- i s t i c wireless transmission. While the business com munity assumed he was talking about wireless communications signals o nly, he had a far"},{"pageNumber":428,"pageContent":"420 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries grander plan—sending power wirelessly in order that anyone at any place on the planet could plug into freely-available elec tricity. Before his finan- ciers figured out where Tesla's research was leadin g, it was briefly fund- ed by men such as Colonel John Jacob Astor as well as Morgan. The same year that Tesla's generator turned on the power from Niagara Falls, he suffered a major setback. One night in Ma rch of 1895 his labo- ratory burned down, with all files and apparatus de stroyed. When he returned from a meeting, he discovered the smoking mess of twisted metal that had fallen through two floors to the foundatio ns of the building. Afterward he wandered through the streets in a daze for hours. The loss of his papers meant that he could not document what he had been working on. For example, later that year the discovery of X -rays by German phys- icist Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen was made public. Tesl a's papers could have proven that he had been the first to take pict ures by X-ray. GOD OF LIGHTNING Next Tesla concentrated on patenting his methods fo r sending power and messages wirelessly. In 1889 to 1890, Tesla moved h is operations to the high country of Colorado Springs, Colorado, to test his new ideas and develop the art of tuned radio frequency. He built a high-voltage labora- tory on a hillside cow pasture. Inside his lab was the world's largest Tesla coil, and the building was topped by a flagpole-lik e structure. While experimenting on a massive scale, toward his new go al of sending elec- tromagnetic vibrations throughout Earth, he predict ed that Tesla coils could also be pocket-size message receiving devices . Tesla's God of Lightning experiments in Colorado Sp rings were truly dramatic. Thunder reverberated for at least 15 mile s when he fired up the electrical discharges. His massive 52-foot diameter Tesla coils discharged more than 12 million volts at a burst, and threw el ectric sparks of more than a hundred feet in length from the copper ball on top of his pole. The townspeople sometimes thought his laboratory was on fire. The ground under their feet was so highly charged that spectat ors at a distance from the laboratory would see tiny sparks between their heels and the sandy soil when they walked, according to biographer Margaret Cheney. Half a mile away, horses would get a shock from their metal hor seshoes and would bolt in panic. The inventor did start a fire one day, when his \"ma gnifying transmitter\" experiment accidentally burned out the power plant for the town of Colorado Springs. The town went dark and the overloaded dyna mo was in flames. It took Tesla's team of technicians a week to repair t he town's generator."},{"pageNumber":429,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Fuel Savers and Alternate Energy Resources 421 WARDENCLYFFE Satisfied that he knew enough to carry out his magn ificent vision of a world telegraphy system and wireless power, Tesla r eturned to New York. He hired an architect to design a building with a 1 54 foot high wooden tower, to be used as a huge transmitter. The tower was topped with a doughnut-shaped copper electrode. As the design cha nged, the structure evolved to the shape of a giant mushroom sprouting above the low hills of Long Island. Tesla named the project Wardenclyffe, envisioning a station to send out power as well as to broadcast communica tion channels of all radio wavelengths. The tower was nearly finished in 1902, along with the square brick building, 100 feet on each side, built below it for a power- house and laboratory. Tesla predicted that when people experience wireles s transmission of electrical power affecting their everyday lives, \"h umanity will be like an ant heap stirred up with a stick.\" The excitement t hat he anticipated never had a chance to develop, however. Work on the struc ture halted in 1906 after J. Pierpont Morgan stopped funding it. Some historians believe that Morgan had been sincer ely interested in wireless broadcasting. Others argue that Morgan's m otivation for briefly funding Tesla's tower was to gain control over Tesl a. As long as Tesla was an uncontrolled loner, a wild card in the industria l world, his inventions could threaten Morgan's investments in the electric al industry. If wireless transmission of power worked, of course, the value of power utilities and copper mines would plummet. Morgan's companies such as General Electric could have toppled. While Tesla's fortunes went downhill starting in 19 06, Morgan would not reply to Tesla's letters, and other financiers on Wall Street also turned their backs on Tesla for the remainder of his life. In a letter begging an associate for financial help, Tesla mentioned one o f the tactics used to dis- credit him. \"My enemies have been so successful in representing me as a poet and a visionary . ..\" One of Tesla's biographers is Dr. Marc Seifer, a ps ychology professor who researched a psycho-biography of Tesla for his doctoral thesis. Seifer believes that Tesla sowed the seeds of his own fina ncial ruin by not making clear to J. P. Morgan, Sr. his intention to broadcast power from Wardenclyffe as well as to send communications. How ever, Seifer also thinks that Morgan could have transcended his own l imitations and given Tesla the money to complete at least the radio port ion of the tower \"and the world would have evolved in a totally different way.\""},{"pageNumber":430,"pageContent":"422 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries MORGAN SABOTAGED TESLA DEALS Instead, from that time onward Tesla was unable to build the technologies which he believed would help humanity. Seifer menti ons the influential men whom Morgan paid a visit when they were ready to cl ose a deal with Tesla. \"Morgan purposefully scuttled any future ways Tesla could raise money.\" He was deeply in debt, having plowed all his resour ces into his experi- ments and Wardenclyffe. Having a strong taste for t he elegant life, he had run up an outrageous tab in his more than twenty ye ars of living at the Waldorf-Astoria hotel. The hotel took the deed for Wardenclyffe in lieu of payment. Seifer feels that one reason for Tesla han ding over the property to the owner of the Waldorf-Astoria is that he thought he could eventually res- urrect the project. His plan was to develop an inve ntion that would be a big money-maker, and his hopes were pinned onto his bla deless turbine/pump. Tesla expected the bladeless turbine to replace the gasoline engine in auto- mobiles, ocean liners and airplanes and then he wou ld use the subsequent wealth to complete his project for world-wide wirel ess power. Seifer concludes that one of Tesla's motivations fo r another invention, a beam weapon which was also called a death ray, wa s to convince his government that the Wardenclyffe tower should be sa ved for military use. By attaching a beam weapon to it, he could have cla imed that the tower was a strategic property for shooting down incoming aircraft or subma- rines during World War I. His efforts were further scattered during this time by a lawsuit against Guglielmo Marconi, the Italian who had hung around his laboratory before the fire of March 13, 1885. In 1901 Marconi sent a signal across the Atlantic which in the eyes of the public secure d Marconi's claim to be the inventor of radio. When Tesla had heard the new s of the transatlantic wireless signal, he reportedly said, \"Marconi is a good fellow. Let him continue. He's using seventeen of my patents.\" By the time Tesla tried to collect the hundreds of thousands of dollars owed him so he could rescue Wardenclyffe, most of h is patents had elapsed. He did resurrect his main radio patent in 1914, Seifer said. Tesla did not win his suit against Marconi, not because o f the legal strength of his case but because World War I interfered. The as sistant attorney gener- al of the time, Franklin Roosevelt, and President W oodrow Wilson pushed for a law saying there could be no patent disputes during the war. Seifer added that by the time the war was over it was much more difficult for Tesla to sue. (Eight months after his death, th e U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Tesla's radio-related patents preceded M arconi's. Even after the court's decision, school history books continue to credit Marconi for in venting radio.)"},{"pageNumber":431,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Fuel Savers and Alternate Energy Resources 423 Tesla was squeezed out of the picture by the force of corporate inter- ests. \"David Sarnoff was Marconi's front man, and S arnoff created RCA and NBC and purposely kept Tesla's patents out of t he loop,\" Seifer said. \"So when people like Hammond and Marconi were getti ng $500,000 at a clip for their wireless patents, Tesla got nothin g.\" RADIO CORPORATION ELBOWS HIM OUT The picture of corporate ruthlessness is reinforced by the experience of the late Philo T. Farnsworth, an inventor of televi sion. In Philo's biogra- phy, Elma G. Farnsworth told about Sarnoff's treatm ent of her husband, and about the early 1930s when RCA dominated the ra dio industry to the point where no one could make broadcasting or recei ving equipment with- out paying patent royalties to RCA. \"RCA's policy r egarding patents, licenses, and royalties was very simple: the compan y was formed to col- lect patent royalties. It never paid them.\" Elma Fa rnsworth added that cor- porations have always been ambivalent toward invent ors and patents. \"Although they regard patents as a huge bulwark whe n protecting their own monopolies, they see the patent system as a gre at nuisance when it upholds the rights of an individual.\" She gives the example of two pio- neers of radio who battled RCA for their rights uns uccessfully. Dr. Lee DeForest died bankrupt and Major Howard Armstrong p ut on his coat, hat and gloves and walked out the high window of his Ne w York Apartment. Tesla never threatened suicide, but he did admit to despairing. Before he could make much progress with the bladeless turbine , his dream of saving the Wardenclyffe structure began to crumble. For on e thing, the new owner saw no value in the project and did not post guards on the property. Since the businessman believed that Tesla was just a vain dre amer, he did not try to protect the contents of the laboratory and it was v andalized and stripped. The Wardenclyffe tower was dynamited in 1917, but n ot by the gov- ernment as some legends would have it. Instead it w as torn down to be sold as scrap metal. After this dramatic turning po int in Tesla's career, he began to disappear from public view. HOPES PINNED ON TURBINE Perhaps partly to run away from the sight of the ru ined Wardenclyffe structure, the inventor travelled to Chicago. That city held memories of earlier, more triumphant, times such as the World's Fair of 1893 which showcased his AC technologies. Now he spent time wi th biographer Hugo Gernsback as well as worked on technical problems w ith the round disks in his bladeless turbine. In h i s day the available steel was not strong enough far anything moving at such a high speed.

The Tesla Engine Builders' Association is a coop- erative network of researchers doing just what thei r name says. This is perhaps the most practical Tesla invention at this time, and could be exten- sively replacing fossil fuel or nuclear power gener ation.) From Chicago he moved again, living alternately in Milwaukee and New York for a few years. During this time he sold a speedometer which he invented to a watch company. It was installed in the luxury cars of the day and provided him some income. Among other inven tions which ear- lier had fleetingly provided income was a fountain which he designed in 1915. He figured out how to power a decorative foun tain to get aestheti- cally-pleasing effects with little water. DESPERATELY SEEKING FUNDS Was Tesla also a would-be defense contractor? Tesla had a liaison in Germany before World War I and in 1916 to 1917 they planned to put the bladeless turbine in tanks and other war vehicles. This was the reason that J. P. Morgan, Jr. doled out more than $20,000 to Te sla to develop the tur- bine, Seifer notes. In a recent book, Dr. Seifer chronicles Tesla's \"lo st years,\" from 1915 onward, when the inventor tried unsuccessfully to r aise money for resur- recting his wireless project. Seifer encountered co rrespondence and arti- cles linking Tesla to such shadowy figures as a Naz i propagandist and a German munitions manufacturer from whom the despera te inventor was trying to get funding by selling his death ray conc epts. Those attempts ended when war was declared between their two count ries. About Tesla's links to warlords during the 1930s, Seifer says \"Th ere's a whole secret side here that needs to be explored further. I did the best I could.\" Unknown to most Teslaphiles, the inventor was not a lways based in New York during those hidden years. For example, ar ound the year 1925 to 1926 he was in Philadelphia working on the turbi ne design, and in 1931 he was in Massachusetts working with the head of U. S. Steel in an attempt to put his turbines in the steel mills. Seifer says a 300 page book was written about Tesla 's turbine, but it has not surfaced since the inventor's death. CAR RAN ON EREE ENERGY? Tesla kept a much lower profile regarding another i nvention. The story— seemingly impossible to document, generations later —is that when he was around sixty-five, Tesla or his helpers pulled the gasoline engine out of a new Pierce-Arrow and stuck in an 80 horsepower alternating current electric motor. But no batteries! Instead, he bough t a dozen vacuum tubes, wires and resistors. Soon he had the parts arranged in a box which sat"},{"pageNumber":433,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Fuel Savers and Alternate Energy Resources 425 beside him in the front seat of the car. One accoun t says the mysterious box was two feet long, a foot wide and six inches h igh, with two rods sticking out of it. From the driver's side, Tesla r eached over and pushed the rods in, and the car took off at up to 80 miles per hour. He is reported to have test-driven the loaned Pierce-Arrow for a w eek. If this story is true, the secret of his power source died with him. There are clues that indicate he could well have dr iven a car on \"free energy.\" For example, Tesla wrote to his friend Rob ert Johnson, editor of Century magazine, that he had invented an electrica l generator that didn't need an outside source of power. In the early 1930s , Tesla announced that he had, more than twenty-five years earlier, harnes sed cosmic rays and made them operate a moving device. Trying to discover what he had been talking about, today's researchers comb through his patents, such as \"Apparatus for th e Utilization of Radiant Energy,\" U.S. Patent No. 658,957, 1901. The research indicates Tesla was working on his \"free energy\" generator be fore he hammered out a major article for Robert Johnson's June 1900 issu e of Century, in which he describes sending power wirelessly. He writes th at a device for getting energy directly from the sun would not be very prof itable and there- fore would not be the best solution. Researchers su ch as scientist Oliver Nichelson of Utah read this to mean that Tesla had learned that a \"free energy\" device would never be allowed to reach the market, but a system in which someone could still profit by selling powe r delivered wirelessly had more of a chance of being allowed by the financ ial tycoons. Today's creative-edge physicists may be vindicating Tesla's so-called free energy invention with their theories about the possibility of tapping incredibly abundant—estimated to be the energy equi valent of 10-to-the- 94th-power grams per cubic centimeter —supply of en ergy from the vac- uum of space that Adam Trombly spoke about. GOVERNMENT AGENTS TAKE HIS PAPERS According to his biographers, Tesla died in genteel poverty in a hotel room in 1943 at age eighty-seven. His memory was ho nored in a funeral service at St. John's cathedral, attended by more t han two thousand peo- ple including the elite of the day. Although Tesla had become a United States citizen i n 1899 and valued his citizenship highly for the next fifty-nine year s, he was strangely treat- ed like a recent immigrant at the end of his life. After his death the public was told that his papers had been shipped back to Y ugoslavia, and that authorities in Washington had sent in the Custodian of Alien Property to deal with his belongings. U.S. government agents re portedly had first crack at his safe and other papers. Later a Tesla m useum was built in"},{"pageNumber":434,"pageContent":"426 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries Zagreb, Yugoslavia, to house whatever Tesla memorab ilia survived the events after his death. When biographer Margaret Cheney looked into the mil itary's posses- sion of Tesla papers taken from the Office of Alien Properties, the trail led to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. The respo nse from Wright- Patterson AFB under the Freedom of Information Act in 1980 was that \"The organization (Equipment Laboratory) that perfo rmed the evaluation of Tesla's papers was deactivated several years ago . After conducting an extensive search of lists of records retired by tha t organization, in which we found no mention of Tesla's papers, we concluded that the documents were destroyed at the time the laboratory was deact ivated.\" Believe that or not, the fact remains that a great discoverer was left out of our history books but is known among researchers of alternative tech- nology. Does the military own Tesla technology info rmation which could be used for cleaning up the planet instead of for d estructive purposes? Did those industrialists who have monopolies on coal an d oil also try to con- trol Tesla's legacy? Consider his claim of inventin g an electrical genera- tor that would not consume any fuel. \"Ere many gene rations pass, our machinery will be driven by a power obtainable at a ny point in the uni- verse,\" Tesla said. \". . . Throughout space there i s energy.\" If that energy had been harnessed, those who profit by the myth of scarcity would not have been able to drum up support for their oil war s. Whether he died of natural causes or was deliberate ly given arsenic, the story of Nikola Tesla is clouded by the actions of those who lacked his dedication to improving the lot of humanity. The man softly crying as he sat beside me at the Te sla symposium may have been a finely-tuned receiver for the prevailin g mood in the room.

Your le tter has vivified the memory of our beginning friendship, of the first im perfect attempts and undeserved successes, of kindnesses and misundersta ndings. It has brought painfully to my mind the greatness of early expecta tions, the quick flight of time, and alas! the smallest of realizations. The f ollowing lines which, but for your initiative, might not have been given to t he world for a long time yet, are an offering in the friendly spirit of old, and my best wishes for your future success accompany them. Towards the close of 1898 a systematic research, ca rried on for a num- ber of years with the object of perfecting a method of transmission of electrical energy through the natural medium, led m e to recognize three important necessities: First, to develop a transmit ter of great power; sec- ond, to perfect means for individualizing and isola ting the energy trans- mitted; and, third, to ascertain the laws of propag ation of currents through the earth and the atmosphere. Various reasons, not the least of which was the help proffered by my friend Leonard E. Curtis a nd the Colorado Springs Electric Company, determined me to select f or my experimental investigations the large plateau, two thousand mete rs above sea-level, in the vicinity of that delightful resort, which I rea ched in May, 1899. I had not been there but a few days when I congratulated myself on the happy choice and I began the task, for which I had long t rained myself, with a grateful sense and full of inspiring hope. The perf ect purity of the air, the unequaled beauty of the sky, the imposing sight of a high mountain range, the quiet and restfulness of the place—all around c ontributed to make the Communicated to the Thirtieth Anniversary Number of the Electrical World and Engineer, March 5, 1904."},{"pageNumber":437,"pageContent":" Experimental Laboratory, Colorado Springs. conditions for scientific observation ideal. To thi s was added the exhila- rating influence of a glorious climate and a singul ar sharpening of the senses. In those regions the organs undergo percept ible physical changes. The eyes assume an extraordinary limpidity, improvi ng vision; the ears dry out and become more susceptible to sound. Objec ts can be clearly dis- tinguished there at distances such that I prefer to have them told by some- one else, and I have heard—this I can venture to vo uch for—the claps of thunder 700 and 800 kilometers [roughly 400 to 500 miles] away. I might have done better still, had it not been tedious to wait for the sounds to arrive, in definite intervals, as heralded precisel y by an electrical indicat- ing apparatus—nearly an hour before. In the middle of June, while preparations for other work were going on, I arranged one of my receiving transformers with th e view of determining in a novel manner, experimentally, the electric pot ential of the globe and studying its periodic and casual fluctuations. This formed part of a plan carefully mapped out in advance. A highly sensitive , self-restorative de- vice, controlling a recording instrument, was inclu ded in the secondary circuit, while the primary was connected to the gro und and an elevated terminal of adjustable capacity. The variations of potential gave rise to electric surgings in the primary; these generated s econdary currents, which in turn affected the sensitive device and rec order in proportion to their intensity. The earth was found to be, literal ly, alive with electrical vibrations, and soon I was deeply absorbed in this interesting investiga- tion. No better opportunities for such observations as I intended to make could be found anywhere. Colorado is a country famo us for the natural displays of electric force. In that dry and rarefie d atmosphere the sun's rays beat the objects with fierce intensity. I rais ed steam, to a dangerous The Suppression of Fuel Savers and Alternate Energy Resources 429"},{"pageNumber":438,"pageContent":"430 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries pressure, in barrels filled with concentrated salt solution, and the tin-foil coatings of some of my elevated terminals shriveled up in the fiery blaze. An experimental high-tension transformer, carelessl y exposed to the rays of the setting sun, had most of its insulating comp ound melted out and was rendered useless. Aided by the dryness and rarefact ion of the air, the water evaporates as in a boiler, and static electricity i s developed in abundance. Lightning discharges are, accordingly, very frequen t and sometimes of inconceivable violence. On one occasion approximate ly twelve thousand discharges occurred in two hours, and all in a radi us of certainly less than fifty kilometers from the laboratory. Many of them resembled gigantic trees of fire with the trunks up or down. I never s aw fire balls, but as a compensation for my disappointment I succeeded late r in determining the mode of their formation and producing them artifici ally. In the latter part of the same month I noticed seve ral times that my instruments were affected stronger by discharges ta king place at great dis- tances than by those nearby. This puzzled me very m uch. What was the cause? A number of observations proved that it coul d not be due to the dif- ferences in the intensity of the individual dischar ges, and I readily ascer- tained that the phenomenon was not the result of a varying relation between the periods of my receiving circuits and th ose of the terrestrial disturbances. One night, as I was walking home with an assistant, medi- tating over these experiences, I was suddenly stagg ered by a thought. Years ago, when I wrote a chapter of my lecture bef ore the Franklin Institute and the National Electric Light Associati on, it had presented itself to me, but I had dismissed it as absurd and impossible. I banished it again. Nevertheless, my instinct was aroused and so mehow I felt that I was nearing a great revelation. It was on the third of July—the date I shall never forget—when I obtained the first decisive experimental evidence o f a truth of over- whelming importance for the advancement of humanity . A dense mass of strongly charged clouds gathered in the west and to wards the evening a violent storm broke loose which, after spending muc h of its fury in the mountains, was driven away with great velocity over the plains. Heavy and long persisting arcs formed almost in regular t ime intervals. My observations were now greatly facilitated and rende red more accurate by the experiences already gained. I was able to handl e my instruments quickly and I was prepared. The recording apparatus being properly adjusted, its indications became fainter and fainte r with the increasing dis- tance of the storm, until they ceased altogether. I was watching in eager expectation. Sure enough, in a little while the ind ications began again, grew stronger and stronger and, after passing throu gh a maximum, grad- ually decreased and ceased once more. Many times, i n regularly recurring"},{"pageNumber":439,"pageContent":" Experimental Laboratory, Colorado Springs. intervals, the same actions were repeated until the storm which, as evident from simple computations, was moving with nearly co nstant speed, had retreated to a distance of about three hundred kilo meters. Nor did these strange actions stop then, but continued to manifes t themselves with undi- minished force. Subsequently, similar observations were also made by my assistant, Mr. Fritz Lowenstein, and shortly afterw ard several admirable opportunities presented themselves which brought ou t, still more forcibly, and unmistakably, the true nature of the wonderful phenomenon. No doubts whatever remained: I was observing stationar y waves. As the source of disturbances moved away the receiv ing circuit came successfully upon their nodes and loops. Impossible as it seemed, this plan- et, despite its vast extent, behaved like a conduct or of limited dimensions. The tremendous significance of this fact in the tra nsmission of energy by my system had already become quite clear to me. Not only was it practi- cable to send telegraphic messages to any distance without wires, as I rec- ognized long ago, but also able to impress upon the entire globe the faint modulations of the human voice, far more still, to transmit power, in unlim- The Suppression of Fuel Savers and Alternate Energy Resources 431"},{"pageNumber":440,"pageContent":"432 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries ited amounts, to any terrestrial distance and almos t without any loss. With these stupendous possibilities in sight, with the experimental evi- dence before me that their realization was hencefor th merely a question of expert knowledge, patience and skill, I attacked vi gorously the develop- ment of my magnifying transmitter, now, however, no t so much with the original intention of producing one of great power, as with the object of learning how to construct the best one. This is, es sentially, a circuit of very high self-induction and small resistance which in i ts arrangement, mode of excitation and action, may be said to be the dia metrical opposite of a transmitting circuit typical of telegraphy by Hertz ian or electromagnetic radiations. It is difficult to form an adequate ide a of the marvelous power of this unique appliance, by the aid of which the g lobe will be trans- formed. The electromagnetic radiations being reduce d to an insignificant quantity, and proper conditions of resonance mainta ined, the circuit acts like an immense pendulum, storing indefinitely the energy of the primary exciting impulses and impressions upon the earth an d its conducting atmosphere uniform harmonic oscillations of intensi ties which, as actual tests have shown, may be pushed so far as to surpas s those attained in the natural displays of static electricity. Simultaneously with these endeavors, the means of i ndividualization and isolation were gradually improved. Great import ance was attached to this, for it was found that simple tuning was not s ufficient to meet the vig- orous practical requirements. The fundamental idea of employing a num- ber of distinctive elements, co-operatively associa ted, for the purpose of isolating energy transmitted, I trace directly to m y perusal of Spencer's clear and suggested exposition of the human nerve m echanism. The influ- ence of this principle on the transmission of intel ligence, and electrical energy in general, cannot as yet be estimated, for the art is still in the embryonic stage; but many thousands of simultaneous ly telegraphic and telephonic messages, through one single conducting channel, natural or artificial, and without serious mutual interference , are certainly practica- ble, while millions are possible. On the other hand , any desired degree of individualization may be secured by the use of a gr eat number of co-oper- ative elements and arbitrary variation of their dis tinctive features and order of succession. For obvious reasons, the princ iple will also be valu- able in the extension of the distance of transmissi on. Progress though of necessity slow was steady and su re, for the objects aimed at were in a direction of my constant study a nd exercise. It is, there- fore, not astonishing that before the end of 1899 I completed the task undertaken and reached the results which I have ann ounced in my article in the Century Magazine of June, 1900, every word o f which was care- fully weighed."},{"pageNumber":441,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Fuel Savers and Alternate Energy Resources 433 The experimental station at Colorado Springs showin g the structure used to deter- mine the rate of incremental capacity with referenc e to the earth.

It involves the employ- ment of a number of plants, all of which are capabl e of transmitting indi- vidualized signals to the uttermost confines of the earth. Each of them will be preferably located near some import center of ci vilization and the news it receives through any channel will be flashed to all points of the globe.

Since a single plant of but one hundred horse- power can operate hundreds of millions of instrumen ts, the system will have a virtually infinite working capacity, and it must immensely facili- tate and cheapen the transmission of intelligence. The first of these central plants would have been a lready completed had it not been for unforeseen delays which, fortunatel y, have nothing to do with its purely technical features. But this loss o f time, while vexatious, may, after all, prove to be a blessing in disguise. The best design of which I know has been adopted, and the transmitter will e mit a wave complex of a total maximum activity of ten million horse-power , one percent of which is amply sufficient to \"girdle the globe.\" This eno rmous rate of energy delivery, approximately twice that of the combined falls of Niagara, is obtainable only by the use of certain artifices, wh ich I shall make known in due course. For a large part of the work which I have done so f ar I am indebted to the noble generosity of Mr. J. Pierpont Morgan, whi ch was all the more welcoming and stimulating, as it was extended at a time when those, who have since promised most, were the greatest of doub ters. I also have to thank my friend, Stanford White, for much unselfish and valuable assis- tance. This work is now far advanced, and though th e results may be tardy, they are sure to come. Meanwhile, the transmission of energy on an industr ial scale is not being neglected. The Canadian Niagara Power Company have offered me a splendid inducement, and next to achieving succes s for the sake of the art, it will give me the greatest satisfaction to m ake their concession fi- nancially profitable to them. In this first power p lant, which I have been designing for a long time, I propose to distribute ten thousand horse- power under a tension of one hundred million volts, which I am now able to produce and handle with safety. This energy will be collected all over the globe pr eferably in small amounts, ranging from a fraction of one to a few ho rse-power. One of its chief uses will be the illumination of isolated hom es. It takes very little power to light a dwelling with vacuum tubes operate d by high-frequency currents and in each instance a terminal a little a bove the roof will be suf- ficient. Another valuable application will be the d riving of clocks and other such apparatus. These clocks will be exceedingly si mple, will require absolutely no attention and will indicate rigorousl y correct time. The idea of impressing upon the earth American time is fasci nating and very like- ly to become popular.

Hendershot Mark M. Hendershot THE LESTER J. HENDERSHOT STORY TOLD BY MARK M. HENDERSHOT My name is Mark Hendershot, Lester J. Hendershot wa s my Father. Lester was an inventor and in his many attempts at producing practical items, he had a moderate success a few times with e lectronic toys, and had sold some of his ideas to small manufacturers. His biggest idea, however, was so revolutionary that it embarrassed the nation 's top scientists be- cause they couldn't explain it, and if it could be perfected, it would possi- bly eliminate the need for public electric utilitie s in many instances, and it would completely change most of our present conc epts of motivation. His earlier invention was called a \"motor\" by the n ewspapers, but it was actually a generator which was powered by the m agnetic field of the earth. His later models created enough electricity to simultaneously light a 120 volt light bulb and a table model radio. I wi tnessed it furnishing the power to run a television set and a sewing machine for hours at a time in our living room. It was in 1927 and 1928 that my Father began to thi nk seriously about this \"fuel-less\" generator. He had taken up flying in 1925 and he soon realized that the ultimate development of aviation would be greatly en- hanced by the creation of an absolutely true and re liable compass, and his first efforts were to produce such an instrument. He theorized that the magnetic compass did not poin t to true north and varies from true north to a different extent at alm ost every point on the earth's surface. Also, the induction compass has to be set before each flight and at that time was not always reliable. He claimed that with a pre- magnetized core he could set up a magnetized field that would indicate the true north, but he didn't know just how to utilize that in the compass he had set out to develop. 438"},{"pageNumber":447,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Fuel Savers and Alternate Energy Resources 439 In continuing his experiments, he found that by cut ting the same line of magnetic force north and south, he had an indicator of the true north and that by cutting the magnetic field east and west, h e could develop a rotary motion. With this principle in mind, he switched his plans and began working on a motor which utilized this magnetic power. He b uilt one that would rotate at a constant speed, a speed pre-determined when the motor was built. It could be built for a desired speed, he sa id, and he felt that a reli- able constant speed motor was one of the greatest n eeds in aviation at that time. The one he built developed 1,800 revolutions per minute. In the following years, he realized that the idea o f a magnetically pow- ered motor was not as practical as a magnetically-p owered generator, so his later work was directed toward the generator. To avoid confusion, it should be pointed out that t he early experiments began on a magnetically-powered motor, and later a generator. The first significant experiments on the motor vers ion were held at Selfridge Field, Detroit, under the direction of Ma jor Thomas G. Lanphier, commandant of the field and leader of the First Pur suit Group. The device demonstrated at Selfridge was a small mo del of what he hoped would be developed into an airplane engine [p owered by earth's magnetic field]. Quotes in the newspapers referred to top aeronautical brass of the day and their impressions of what they saw. One such report was credited to William B. Stout, p resident of the Stout Air Service, Inc., and designer of the all-metal ty pe plane used by the Ford Motor Company. Stout's comments were: \"The demonstr ation was very impressive. It was actually uncanny. I would like v ery much to see a large model, designed to develop enough power to lift an airplane.\" Major Lanphier's comments to reporters after the de monstrations were: \"The whole thing is so mysterious and startling tha t it has the appearance of being a fake.\" \"I was extremely skeptical when I saw the first mod el,\" he continued, \"but I helped to build the second one and witnessed the winding of the magnet. I am sure there was nothing phoney about it .\" My Father had first shown the military brass how hi s model worked, then he supervised army technicians in building the ir own model, which worked perfectly. Major Lanphier said that the elec trical men to whom they had shown the motor \"... laughed at the way we wired it up and said it wouldn't work. Then it DID work.\" It was the Selfridge Field experiment which touched off the series of stories in the national press. Stories with blaring headlines in such papers as the Detroit Free Press, Detroit News, Detroit Ti mes, Pittsburgh papers, The New York Times, and many others. Most of them t agged the instru-"},{"pageNumber":448,"pageContent":"440 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries ment demonstrated at Selfridge the \"miracle motor,\" and there were pic- tures of Major Lanphier and Col. Lindbergh, my Fath er and the motor. Anything in the news during that period which could be connected with Lindbergh was front page whether he had an active i nterest, or just hap- pened to be in the area at the time. Headlines in t he various papers read, \"Gasless Motor Tested for Lindy,\" \"Lindy Inspects F uelless Motor for Airplanes,\" and \"Lindbergh Tries Motor That The Ear th Runs.\" One story even stated that, at its request, Lindbergh and Lan phier were flying to New York to show the motor to the Guggenheim Founda tion for the Promotion of Aeronautics. Later reports, however, emphasized that Lindbergh a ctually had noth- ing whatsoever to do with the experiments, and that he had just witnessed a couple of the demonstrations as the guest of his friend, Major Lanphier. The Selfridge tests seemed to satisfy Lanphier and his associates, how- ever, and during the period he was there, the model the technicians built obtained as high as 1,800 revolutions per minute an d they announced its performance was entirely satisfactory. It was e stimated these motors would run for 2,000 to 3,000 hours before the magne t center would have to be recharged. A man named Dr. F. W. Hochstetter, of the Hochstett er Research Laboratories in Pittsburgh, hastily called a news c onference and displayed models of what he said were the \"Hendershot Motor.\" He demonstrated them, and when they wouldn't work, he declared Hend ershot was a fake, and that the motors worked only because of power de rived from con- cealed pencil batteries. After he exhibited his models of the motor, Dr. Hoc hstetter announced that they wouldn't generate enough electricity to \" . . . light a 1-volt fire- fly\" or to \". . . stitch a fairy's britches.\" Noting the lavish lecture room in a New York hotel which had been rented by (or for) Dr. Hochstetter for the press co nference, Dr. Hochstetter was asked [by one reporter] why he was so intereste d in the Hendershot demonstrations and in trying to discredit them. He replied merely that he had \"come to expose a fraud which would be capable of destroying faith in science for 1,000 years\" and he claimed his only motive was that \"pure science might shine forth untarnished.\" It was obvious to those who were pro-Hendershot tha t, in view of all the fuss and bother of such a noted scientist as Dr . Hochstetter, somewhere behind it all, someone was anxious for the innovati on to be ridiculed. When approached with the accusations, my Father smi led and told reporters, \"Dr. Hochstetter is correct, to a degree . I have concealed batter- ies in a model or two because I found that I could not tr u s t some of my visitors, and I also had evidence that someone had tampered with my work."},{"pageNumber":449,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Fuel Savers and Alternate Energy Resources 441 So, I put a couple of batteries in on occasion to l ead the intruders away from what I was working on.\" He added that Major Lanphier and his army technicia ns were proof enough of his claims. \"I didn't build the motor tha t was demonstrated at Detroit,\" he pointed out. \"That was built by Army m en under orders from Major Lanphier and under my direction. I didn't eve n so much as wind the motor. They built the motor and it works. That's my answer to all the crit- ics—it works.\" Dr. Hochstetter and his associates also claimed my Father had signed a contract and received $25,000 for exploitation of t he motor, but after a brief period of excitement, the matter was dropped— unproven. Not long after his demonstrations of the motor, Dr. Hochstetter died under unusual circumstances. He was in a Baltimore and Ohio train wreck, and he was the only passenger on the whole train wh o lost his life! My Father was the butt of many jokes and comments a t the time of the debates about his invention. An artist, drawing for one of the Pittsburgh papers, depicted him in a cartoon riding a propello rless airplane. The cap- tion made fun of him. In later years my Father remarked, \"Every time I se e a jet plane go over now, I think of that cartoon and how everyone laugh ed at me for suggest- ing a plane could some day fly without a propeller. Twenty-five years ago I tried to tell them that.\" As suddenly as it all started, the publicity and se nsationalism of the Hendershot motor stopped. The last news story to ap pear was on March 10, 1928, when a small article appeared in most pap ers saying that Lester Hendershot was a patient in Emergency Hospital in W ashington. The personal account he gave was much the same as t he newspaper quote, with the minor exception that he was it by a bolt of 220 volts, not the jolting 2,000 the over-eager reporter had writt en. He was demonstrat- ing the motor in the patent office, and the shock p aralyzed his vocal chords, resulting in several weeks of recuperation before he completely recovered. Something happened during this period that could ex plain the actions of Dr. Hochstetter and his associates. My Father sa id that while he was in the hospital, he was approached by a large corporat ion to stop his activi- ty in connection with the motor or generator. Until the day he died, he would not reveal the name of the company, only that if he were successful with his generator, it would be a serious threat to their multimillion dollar industry. He na med the sum he accept- ed as $25,000, and the condition was that he was no t to build another unit for twenty years. That's when he dropped out of sig ht. I've thought about the bizarre events connected wit h the generator, and"},{"pageNumber":450,"pageContent":"442 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries feel it is possible the \"large corporation\" first t ried to stop the activities through Dr. Hochstetter. When this failed, they app roached my Father per- sonally and bought him off. It's interesting to not e that one of the doctor's charges was that he was paid $25,000 to exploit his work. Isn't it odd that this is the same figure actually paid, but to stop his activities, but was quoted before he was approached with the offer? My Father admitted that he and the family lived in constant fear, as we were being contacted every so often by crackpots wh o had delved into the records and discovered his creation, and had gone t o the trouble of search- ing him out. Some of them, he suspected, were repre sentatives of subver- sive groups and/or foreign powers. This latter charge seems a little exaggerated, but was supported by a series of letters he received from a fellow in Ohio in 1952. He had traced my Father by going back to his hometown in Pennsylv ania and talking to my uncle about the generator. The first letter explained that he was a part of a group of scientists who were privately financing their own research on the same phenomena my Father discovered in 1928. He emphasized they would not allow back- ing by any organization or government since an inve ntion such as the Hendershot Generator should be for \"all the peoples and should not be controlled by national governments, but should be g iven gratis to the World Government when it is ready to assume World R esponsibility.\" He was critical of my Father for allowing the military to look at it in 1928. That letter was written in April, and in June a pos tcard came with the following terse message, \"Will shortly make public via radio and news- paper, connection your generator with 'Flying Sauce r Propulsion.' Request Security Clearance from Security Chief your group within forty- eight hours. Have succeeded in duplication of your Generator.\" In July my Father received a four-page hand-written epistle from the Ohio man. To my knowledge, it was the last letter t he writer sent on the subject. He discussed information his intelligence had received on flying saucers, modestly admitting his sources were better than the CIA or the FBI, which he claimed had investigated him several times. He intimated that a Pasadena scientist had recently been kidnapp ed because he was working on an attempt to adapt the generator to air craft. Then he went into a long and rambling dissertation on how he got inter- ested in what he called the \"Ether Vortex Phenomena \" and the generator. He explained that the magnetic field in the earth a nd volcanic action are related, according to his studies. He had spent two and one-half years in Japan working with Japanese volcanic scientists on the subject. He mentioned one study he had made, and pointed out that the shift of the strata causing the volcano was due to a rotatio n of the Electromagnetic"},{"pageNumber":451,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Fuel Savers and Alternate Energy Resources 443 Field of the volcano at high speeds. He urged my Fa ther to write a com- plete paper on his findings and publish them (prefe rably send them to the Earthquake Research Institute in Tokyo). Referring to a particularly bad earthquake which ha d just occurred in the Los Angeles vicinity a few months before, the w riter warned my Father not to operate his generator in the area nea r the San Andreas (seis- mic) Fault which runs through the area. He said, \"Y ou may not believe it, but you can cause earthquake activity to increase i f you continue to oper- ate your generator in that district. I am wondering if you were not direct- ly responsible for the recent earthquake near Los A ngeles?\" Then he promised that he and his associates would k eep the possibility of his involvement in the earthquake to themselves. Letters such as these, plus occasional phone calls when the callers would not identify themselves, and a threat from an admitted Communist which was turned over to the FBI, caused my Father concern much of the time. If a large organization would take over the g enerator and its re- search, all he wanted out of it was enough money to take care of himself and his family in the future years. One of the most encouraging offers came in Septembe r of 1956 when my Father received word that officials of the Mexic an government want- ed to meet with him and discuss the possibility of using his generator for the rural development program in Mexico. Government officials flew to Los Angeles and drove out to our house, where our family doctor who spoke Spanish acted as interpreter. Arrange- ments were made for the family to go to Mexico City , and for my Father to work with Mexican technicians on the generator. We all flew to Mexico City and were housed in an ap artment near the home of the Director of Electricity. My Father supe rvised the Mexicans in building a model. He had been working with them for several weeks becoming more and more tense as time passed. He con fessed to my Mother that he was frightened because he understood no Spanish, and his fellow workers talked constantly in little groups b y themselves, often glancing over at him. He couldn't understand a word they were saying, and it worried him considerably. One morning in February of 1957, the laboratory cal led and asked where my Father was. My Mother told them he had lef t for work in the morning, and if he wasn't there, she had no idea wh ere he might be. She became increasingly concerned as the day passed and there was no word from him. That night he didn't come home, and we were on the verge of hysteria by next morning, then we received a telegram from L os Angeles. My Father's fear had worked i t s e l f into a nervous fren zy and he had rushed to"},{"pageNumber":452,"pageContent":"444 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries the airport the day before and taken a plane for Ca lifornia. To the day of his death, it was a closed subject and he would nev er explain why he was compelled to leave us so suddenly under such strang e circumstances, except that he feared for his life. The final attempt to promote the generator came in the latter part of 1960 when a Dr. Lloyd E. Cannon convinced my Father that he had the facilities to present the project to the United Sta tes Navy for research and development. Cannon said he was the General Manager of his own c ompany, Force Research of Los Angeles, Palm Springs and the Mojav e Desert. Cannon explained that his group was made up of many dedica ted scientists of var- ious fields who contributed time and knowledge to F orce Research proj- ects. The range of experimentation covered electron ics, astronautics, free energies, propulsion, and parapsychology. Under my Father's supervision, two models were buil t and 100 copies of a fifty-six-page \"proposal\" were printed for pre sentation to the various government agencies and politicians who would have to review the proj- ect for its consideration. After the completion of the proposal and it had bee n sent to the gov- ernment with no results, Cannon traveled the southw estern United States with the models trying to raise money for research. His visits were increasingly less frequent to our home until 1961, when a tragic climax to this story occurred. On April 19, 1961, upon returning home from school, I found my Father dead. It was recorded as a suicide without a ny further investigation. For those who might be interested in my Father's an alysis of how his generator worked, the following are his theories on the subject: This field of magnetism surrounding the earth is si milar to the field of magnetism in a man-made generator. The rotor of a generator is revolved by some means of power, cutting the lines of magnetism, creating electric power. Th e earth is turning inside of a field of magnetism. That, no one contra dicts, yet it is claimed there is no power to be derived from it. Let's say we have a mechanism that will collect, po larize and create a positive and negative connection to this tremendous power that is ever- present on the earth. Take a survey compass. You can hold the needle east or west, and let go of it, and it immediately goes north and south. Thi s same power, when cut by the proper apparatus as the earth rotates inside this magnetism, will produce power, the amount of which is not calculate d at this time."},{"pageNumber":453,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Fuel Savers and Alternate Energy Resources 445 As long as the earth rotates around the sun, it wil l create electric power which some scientists claim does not exist. Yet, we dig into the moun- tains for material that costs us unbelievable sums, to create the same power. This magnetism surrounding the earth is in the same relation to electric power as uranium is to atomic power. Earth's magnet ism is ever-pres- ent at any height or depth. It is equal to uranium as a by-product for power, namely electricity. Magnetism must be cut. The lines of force circling the earth are constant and if this force is broken up, and polarized, you have the equivalent of uranium broken up, which creates a heat and in turn creates power. Breaking up the forces of magnetism, polarizing the m, thereby creating a resistance for power, is the same principal as at omic energy. Scientists claim it requires friction to generate e lectricity. I claim the earth rotating as it does, according to scientific theory, creates friction as a generator. The ever-present magnetism is the fiel d, or stator. We have only to utilize this source of power to lig ht every home, high- way, bridge, airplane or any type of thing that can not now be lighted because of inadequacy of present facilities. A very small unit composed of wire, a magnet, sever al especially designed coils, condensors, collector units, and a few other minor items, will cut this force. Another especially designed me chanism will polarize it, giving a positive and a negative connection to any resistance and the result is the generation of electricity. There you have the theory of how to create electric ity from the mag- netic force of the earth, as written by a man with only a high school ed- ucation. As years went by I've always wanted to continue wit h my Father's invention, but have worried myself about possibly r unning into the same problems my Father did. It would not do my Father justice just to stop all work on it and now I am ready to fulfill his dream. Since childhood I ha ve been fascinated by electricity and have spent over twenty-six years in the electrical trade. Of his three sons, I alone have pursued this fascinati on and have applied my knowledge and experience to carry on my Father's wo rk."},{"pageNumber":454,"pageContent":"Gunfire in the Laboratory: T.

Henry Moray's Radiant Energy Device was . . . su ppressed by readiness, suspicion and desire for power. . . John Moray, The Sea of Energy in Which the Earth Fl oats Professional skeptics were stumped, a generation or two ago, by an inven- tion in Utah. Incredulously, people witnessed a wor king \"free energy\" device. Men of science mailed impressive credential s ahead to open the inventor's workshop door, then strode in to examine his table top appara- tus from all angles, poking it and interrogating hi m in their search for evi- dence of fraud. Scientists were allowed to dismantl e everything except a delicate two-ounce component, the Radiant Energy de tector. When the unit was put back together, they ended up witnessin g—but not all believ- ing their eyes—as the self-contained unit converted some unknown ener- gy into usable power, and ran continually for days at a time. Without any moving parts, the device produced a strange cold fo rm of electricity which lit incandescent bulbs, heated a flat iron and ran a motor. The inventor—T. Henry Moray, D.Sc. of Salt Lake Cit y, Utah—in the late 1920s was a confident thirty-three-year-old en gineer with a young family and a gift to give humanity. The gift was hi s Radiant Energy inven- tion, which as he saw it converted power from the c osmos from rays which, on their eternally-launched flights through space, constantly pierce the earth from all directions. Despite his self-confidence, there were hints that he might be stopped from mass producing his device. His family was hara ssed by mysterious threats. \"Your husband's life is not worth a plugge d nickel unless he co-"},{"pageNumber":455,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Fuel Savers and Alternate Energy Resources 447 operates on Radiant Energy,\" an anonymous caller to ld Ella Moray over the telephone. Their home was repeatedly broken int o when the family was away, as if in warnings of worse to come. But the young man believed in his dream, and expect ed that the world would accept his discovery and would eventually hav e abundant clean energy for homes, vehicles and industry. Many peopl e did arrive at the Moray house in apparent sincerity, and he tuned up the Radiant Energy device for them. An example of Henry's work in 1926 is described in the book by Henry and John Moray, The Sea of Energy In Which the Eart h Floats, in a letter from E. G. Jensen to an associate. One October morn ing in that year, Jensen, another businessman, an attorney, and Henry Moray packed his electrical equipment and a lunch into an automobile and drove into the Utah mountains. Henry kept an eye on the cloudy sky through the car win- dow; he did not like to work in a storm. His spirit s rose when the sky lightened occasionally and cheered him with shafts of sunlight. He sat back and let the other men pick the location ; the more they had a hand in the work, the more likely that they would believe it. They chose to drive 26 miles from the nearest power line, to a spot on a little stream which undulated down a grassy flat to Strawberry La ke. After they unloaded the car, the businessmen pounded the six-f oot long lower section of his ground pipe into the creek bed, then screwed a four-foot section of the half-inch water pipe onto it. Also without help from Henry, the wit- nesses to the test put up two antenna poles about 9 0 feet apart. Other than the antenna and ground wires, Moray's on ly equipment was a brown container about the size of a butter box, a nother slightly smaller box, a fibreboard box about 6 x 4 x 4 inches containing mysterious \"tubes\" and one other piece—a metal baseboard with what seemed to be a magnet at one end, a switch and a receptacle for an electric light globe as well as posts for connecting wires. He set these parts on the car's running board and s tood on a rubber mat on top of two dry boards to protect against electri c shock. Wrong plan; it turned out that the running board was not wide enou gh to be a workbench. Unruffled by the change of plans, he gently moved h is equipment onto the planks on the ground. Snowflakes drifted lightly in the air, so the three spectators hung a tarpaulin over open car doors to protect the electrical equipment. Before Henry primed and tuned his apparatus, he put a key into the post and showed the men that there was no power flowing. Then he tuned the device by stroking the end of a magnet across two p ieces of metal stick- ing out from what seemed to be another magnet. Afte r tuning for about ten minutes, Moray put the key i n t o the post, and the 1 00-watt light bulb"},{"pageNumber":456,"pageContent":"448 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries brought along by one of the men burned brightly for fifteen minutes. Jensen wrote that the light was even, without fluct uations. While the light was burning, Mr. Moray disconnected the antenna lead- in wire from the apparatus and the light went out. He connected it again and the light appeared. He also disconnected the gr ound wire and the light went out. Mr. Moray . . . said he could do the same thing in the middle of the Sahara Desert or in the deepest mine. When the demo nstration was over we congratulated Mr. Moray and I felt confiden t that he had a real invention and that no hoax was being perpetrated. Where, then, was the dazzling light—the strange ele ctricity which seemed to ignite the entire contents of a light bulb—comin g from? Moray's device had no batteries. Was this Utah scientist gifted wi th advanced intuitive understanding about a previously-unknown source of energy? The answer may be found in Henry's words: \"Energy can be obtai ned by oscillatory means in harmony with the vibrations of the univers e ... the Moray Radiant Energy Device is a high-speed electron osci llating device.\" He also said that those vibrations continually surged onto the earth like waves onto a seashore. \"The power—the surges—would come in so strongly dur ing the day that it would burn out his detector,\" Henry and Ell a Moray's oldest son, John Moray, told the author. \"So he mainly worked a t night.\" Since the device seemed to go against current \"laws \" of physics, pro- fessional doubters went to ludicrous lengths in att empts to dismiss it as a hoax. Moray's sons remember the family laughing abo ut a visitor who saw the device working in Moray's basement. He insi sted that \"Mrs. Moray was secretly powering it; she must have been pacing back and forth on a carpet upstairs and generating static el ectricity!\" Would-be debunkers, sabotage, and lack of funding w ere only some of the obstacles in the way of further developing the invention. Because of betrayals, Henry Moray himself eventually distruste d people outside his family and he guarded his technical secrets closely —even to the point of losing a potential business deal. HERITAGE OF WARINESS Causes for Henry's untrusting nature are outlined b y John Moray, in the second edition of The Sea of Energy. To begin with, a heritage of wariness was passed on from previous generations. Henry's mo ther, Swedish immi- grant Petronella Larson, had a rather difficult lif e before she married an American, James Cain Moray. James had been born in Ireland to a fam- ily which had to hide from being killed by politica l enemies. After"},{"pageNumber":457,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Fuel Savers and Alternate Energy Resources 449 Henry's father died (in Salt Lake City) of natural causes, certain individ- uals—people whom the Morays trusted—swindled his mo ther out of the family fortune. She turned to her only son, hoping that Henry would specialize in money matters, and she insisted that he attend a La tter Day Saints (Mormon church) college because it had a good busin ess course. However, from the age of nine Henry had had a drivi ng interest of his own—radio and electrical science. In his spare time as a boy he searched the garbage dump for scraps of wire and other mater ials for basement tin- kering. By age fifteen, he had a job wiring houses, which taught him more about electricity. Meanwhile, the beginnings of the Radiant Energy con- cepts were pounding through his mind. In the summer of 1909 he started experimenting with taking electricity from the grou nd, and by autumn of the next year he had enough power to run a miniatur e arc light. Thinking about Benjamin Franklin's kite experiment, Henry at first figured he was dealing with static electricity. He later changed h is view. He firmly believed in his energy idea, despite the reigning scientific ideas which would label it as impossible. Even when his experiments only converted enough energy to make a slight click in a telephone receiver, he was sure that he was on the right track. During Chr istmas holidays of 1911, he became more certain that the mysterious en ergy was not static, but was oscillating (swinging back and forth) like pendulum upon pendu- lum across the universe. And he realized that the e nergy was not coming out of the earth, but instead it was coming to the earth from some outside source. The electrical oscillations pound the earth day and night, \"always coming, in vibrations from the reservoir of colossa l energy out there in space.\" After a correspondence course in electrical enginee ring, the next step in his education was an extended stay in Sweden; he went on a mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints . The young mission- ary managed to study science at the University of U psalla and complete a doctoral thesis. Naturally, the thesis related to h is idea that there is energy throughout space. While he was a homesick student/missionary in Scand inavia in the summer of 1913, Henry picked up a soft, white stone -like material out of a railroad car at Abisco, Sweden. He also took some of the material from the side of a hill, tested it and decided the stone might be good to use in a valve-like detector of energy. This led Henry to hi s research in semicon- ductive materials; from this stone he developed the \"Moray valve\" that was used in his early Radiant Energy devices. After he returned to the United States in 1917 he m arried Ella Ryser and they later had five children. On his career ladder, Moray worked his way up"},{"pageNumber":458,"pageContent":"450 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries through various jobs to electrical engineering and positions such as design engineer for the largest oil-cooled electrical swit ch yard in the world. An industrial accident at a power substation in lat e 1920 burned the retina of his eyes and propelled him into legal bat tles for compensation. In a way, losing much of his eyesight for years tur ned out to be a bless- ing. Although it meant an empty bank account at the time because he was unable to work at his usual profession, being force d away from the draw- ing table led him back into Radiant Energy research . SENATOR PROTECTED UTILITIES Far from being the stereotype of a reclusive baseme nt inventor, Moray was known in his community and was listed in a 1925 Who's Who in Engineering. On July 24 of that year, Senator Reed Smoot invited the young inventor to meet with him in the senator's of fice in the Hotel Utah. Henry Moray made an offer which, if accepted, could perhaps have dra- matically changed events in this century. Oil wars, nuclear plant acci- dents, acid rain were yet to come. Henry offered his Radiant Energy discovery to the U nited States gov- ernment. Free of cost. According to The Sea of Ener gy, the senator thanked Moray but replied that the government would decline such an offer. Why? \"On the grounds that the government was not competing with public utilities.\" Undeterred, Henry spent countless hours in his base ment working on solid state physics with what he called the Moray V alve as a detector for radio frequencies. According to his records, early in the 1930s he made a radio which was no bigger than a wristwatch. Part of Henry's invention was his pioneering use of semi-conductors. Moray's first germanium solid-state device (a trans istor) was sent to the U.S. Patent Office in 1927, and was rejected on the basis that it would not work without a heated cathode. Heated cathodes were commonly used in vacuum tubes of that time. This means that Henry Mo ray was so far ahead of his time in semi-conductor technology that the p atent office had not heard of it, and so the bureaucrats decreed that wh at he had was impossi- ble. Of course society later learned that cold cath odes are most definitely possible. But when the transistor was officially in vented twenty years later, no credit was given to Henry Moray. The second generation of Moray's radio valve not on ly picked up radio waves, it also detected a small amount of power. La unched by these experiments with semi-conductors, he followed a tra il of discovery which led to his powerful energy converter. By 1939, a un it weighing less than 55 pounds, including its wooden case, converted 50, 000 watts of power— enough to run a small factory. He tested it 90 mile s from the nearest radio"},{"pageNumber":459,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Fuel Savers and Alternate Energy Resources 451 station, at a desolate area now known as the U.S. A rmy Dugway proving ground, and the device still worked. Witnesses to his experiments included engineers and curiosity-seekers from other countries as well as local visitors from Utah Power and Light, the Secretary of State's office in Utah and other o fficials. As far as this author can discover, no one refuted Henry Moray's c laim that his Radiant Energy device did run motors, light bulbs and a rad io. The invention had unusual characteristics. Photogra phers exclaimed over the intensity of the light from the bulbs—rema rkably brighter than 100- or 150-watt bulbs normally shone. While the invention converted energy from the cosmo s into light and attracted well-known officials, some people entered Moray's life without leaving a calling card. For example, in 1939 he ref used an offer to take his work to Russia. Soon the anonymous threatening phon e calls began, telling Henry there was a contract out on his life. Despite death threats, Henry Moray repeatedly worke d on his strange electric generator in front of creditable witnesses . The only threat which stopped him from demonstrations came in the form of advice from his patent attorneys in Washington, D.C.—under patent l aws he could have lost his rights to a patent if he showed his invent ion to just anyone. The U.S. Patent Office itself was not much help eit her. That agency rejected seven patent applications for his Radiant Energy Device because the device did not fit the physics known at the tim e. \"Where is the source of energy?\" the examiners asked. One rejection noti ce from the patent office wrongly assumed that the energy was original ly electromagnetic. Moray, however, only said it is electrical after it hit his semi-conductors. BULLETS PIERCE WINDSHIELDS Henry carried on multiple battles at the same time. Instead of being helped to research the Radiant Energy device, he was hinde red. In time-wasting letters he fought the patent office, treachery from business partners, and scientists who witnessed Radiant Energy and later d enied it when their employers changed. And he had to be strong to keep his family's morale up in the face of unknown enemies. John Moray remembers an incident in Salt Lake City when he and the other children were in the family car, with his mot her driving. Sitting in the back seat, the boy felt his heart lurch with sh ock as a bullet crashed through the car and lodged in the windshield in fro nt of his mother. \"A classic black sedan with all the shades down almost forced her off the street, then sped away up 21st South.\" W i t h i n a few weeks, an unknown assailant had also f ired shots at Henry's friend S. E. Bringhurst, the first presiden t of his research institute."},{"pageNumber":460,"pageContent":"452 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries Bringhurst did not have bullet-proof glass in his c ar, and the bullet zipped past his head and out the rear of the car. Henry bought a 32.20 revolver and a Colt .32 handgu n to protect his family, in addition to the bullet-proof glass insta lled in the windows of his automobiles. The whole Moray family suffered as a r esult of the mysteri- ous opposition to Henry's work. Mrs. Ella Moray liv ed in fear that some- thing would happen to one of the children, and the children paid the price of losing a normal childhood. They were forbidden t o go anywhere by themselves. Even when the boys were almost teenager s, they could not go out without an escort because of the threat of a ki dnapping. R.E.A. MAN SABOTAGES DEVICE Violence in Henry's laboratory also shocked the fam ily. A man named Felix Frazer who had been sent by the Rural Electri cal Administration to work in Moray's lab went crazy with a sledge hammer (or as some reports say, an axe) one day, and destroyed the Radiant Ene rgy machine. He had not broken into the lab; he had been hired to work there! What type of person would hammer an important inven tion into useless pieces—destroy a device which took years to perfect and which contained expensive and almost irreplaceable parts? John Mora y describes the sabo- teur as \"a double agent trying to force Dr. Moray t o co-operate with the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Rural Electrical A dministration and a communist government.\" John was 12 years old at the time, and as a grown m an he chronicled a related episode in the book Sea of Energy: As a result of the constant threat to his life, my father carried a gun with him at all times. He carried a .32 in his pocket, a nd whenever he walked from the house to the laboratory at night he would wear a 32.20 revolver. He was an excellent shot in the old Western sense . . . On three different occasions, he was attacked at hi s laboratory and shot his way out of the situation. The incident of March 2, 1940, particularly stands out. . . Late that afternoon a friend of mine and I were playing on th e front lawn of our home. My cousin was just starting up his car, which was parked beside my father's car in the garage—the two cars side by side, from the street one could not tell which car was being cranked or w ho was driving. Suddenly several men in a sedan turned into the dri veway and pulled guns as if they intended to fire on the car that wa s starting up in the driveway. When my cousin backed out, the men could see that it was not my father, and they quickly drove away. I told my father about the incident and he laughed, trying to minimize it to prevent my worrying. . . ."},{"pageNumber":461,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Fuel Savers and Alternate Energy Resources 453 Henry Moray later drove John and his two sisters to the Centre Theatre. After the movie, the youngsters phoned home as inst ructed. They were told to wait there; mother would pick them up. However, no one came, and we waited for several hou rs. Finally my cousin Chester picked us up. When we arrived home w e discovered that my father had been shot in the leg and the doctor w as there ... the pres- ident of the company was also there. Henry Moray had gone to his laboratory that evening . When he was ready to leave and had the front door open, he reme mbered to pick up some materials from a locked inner office. As he fu mbled with keys in the dark, he had the impression someone was coming up b ehind him. As he turned to look, a heavy object hit his right should er, leaving the arm half- paralysed. With his left arm, he grabbed the assail ant's head. While Moray pinned the assailant to his left side, the man's gu n became entangled in his overcoat. As the first man struggled, a second man carrying a gun ran up. Henry Moray kicked the second man, knocking his gun free at the same time as the first man's gun discharged. The bullet travelle d downward, grazing the side of Moray's leg, and ricocheted off the concret e floor. Moray's right arm came back to life enough to get his own gun out . He pointed it at the two men and waved them out the front door. \"He was immediately fired upon again by someone at a distance,\" John Moray writes. He returned the fire, knocking the third gunman dow n. A fourth man rushed up to help the wounded gunman. Henry recogni zed this man as Felix Fraser (Rural Electrification Administration Engineer). The second man said to the first assailant, \"Well, you weren't as quick on the draw as you thought you were,\" and Hen ry Moray recog- nized the voice of a FBI man he had known at one ti me as a security guard. At that point, Henry realized he was all alone in a very difficult and dangerous situation. Bleeding severely, Henry knew he would faint at any moment. If he fainted while the men were there, he would be at th eir mercy. \"So in panic he told them to get out, pretending that he had not recognized any of them, and the men promptly left.\" Henry Moray was an excellent shot and could have ki lled his assailant in his laboratory, but Moray was not a violent man."},{"pageNumber":462,"pageContent":"454 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries WOUNDED AND HARASSED He believed the harassments were intended to force him to turn over his laboratory notes to Felix Fraser and associates.

John Moray describes the incident: Later, Felix Fraser came in and rushed back to Juli us Noyes. Shortly after, Fraser returned to the office and fussed aro und for a few minutes, looking at the floor.

Henry Moray refus ed to cooperate further with the REA. John recalls that people atta cked his father's credi- bility. His family later discovered that more than a dozen of Henry's orig- inal patent applications had disappeared from the U .S. Patent Office, although the file jackets remained there. \"The cont ents and applications themselves are gone ... Watergate was not the first great coverup and act of duplicity,\" John Moray wrote. Who stole the more -than-a-dozen patent applications? John Moray says the question will pro bably remain unan- swered. Over half a century after Henry Moray's discovery, his sons are still waiting for an investor who will fund the expensive development of the Moray device; engineering problems still have to be solved. Some researchers believe that T. Henry Moray's secr ets died with him and that the family and associates would not be abl e to replicate his device even if they had funding. After all, a saboteur had destroyed the priceless parts of the Moray device. Moray's sons, however, r eply that Henry had built another working model which he later took apa rt, and that they inherited all his laboratory notes. John remembers the later model, and he describes a 1942 trip to the mountains of Colorado with his father and the devic e. Since it was during World War II, Henry had to scrape up enough gas rat ions for the round trip. He set up the experiment in a park and the un it performed smoothly. \"Well,\" said their host, \"If you leave it here and if my engineers like it, we'll decide if we want to buy it or not.\" This is what Moray ran into all the time, John main tained, \"My dad said 'thanks but no thanks.'\""},{"pageNumber":463,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Fuel Savers and Alternate Energy Resources 455 The second generation of the Moray family of Utah h as lived with the Radiant Energy project close to their hearts for de cades. But their experi- ences make it difficult to trust all too many of th e people who seek him out, even today. John tells about a friend of 30 ye ars, with whom Henry left a piece of equipment. It was not even a power component; it was a measuring piece. His friend tore the equipment apar t looking for its sup- posed secret. WHO WILL HELP INDEPENDENT INVENTOR? The financial cost of developing the Radiant Energy device was high, con- sidering how difficult it was in the 1920s for even an upper-middle-class family to scrape together $400,000 for materials an d equipment, John said. Translating to circa-1995 dollars, the Moray family spent millions on the Radiant Energy Device. Their longtime goal was the development of Radiant Energy, which Henry described in 1958 (lett er to Colin Gardner of California) as a source of energy \"greater than that coming from the Atom, more unlimited and of no danger to the user w hatsoever from radi- ations, residue, etc.\" Gardner was one of countless people who contacted t he Moray family after reading Henry's book Beyond the Light Rays or the later book. In 1958 Gardner conveyed his enthusiasm to fellow U.S. Navy officers at Point Mugu, California. In a letter to Moray, Gardn er offered to connect his superior officers with Moray. Moray's reply ill ustrates his weariness at that point: \"The government has a funny way of goin g at investigating and/or accepting new ideas . . . That is why we are not first into space . . . Just sending me a form to fill out, treating RE as every other minor discovery, is of no interest to me. That is what al l the government branch- es ever do . . .\" Moray left his laboratory door partly open to the N avy, however; and replied to a second letter from Gardner by saying t hat he would be delight- ed to meet Gardner's very top supervisors and discu ss his \"discoveries which are greater than nuclear fission.\" However, a dded Moray, \"we have so many hundreds asking for information who take up our time needless- ly that we cannot spend the time unless it is with those qualified (to under- stand Radiant Energy) and with high enough authorit y to deal.\" Moray's office sent his confidential papers to Gard ner's boss. After two weeks of silence from the Navy, the message relayed back to Moray was \"it is felt that you do not have a commercial produ ct for us to buy and use at our discretion.\" This incident is only one example of difficulties f acing independent inventors of unorthodox energy devices. Although Mo ray spent the family's bank account on experiments which produced a laboratory proof-"},{"pageNumber":464,"pageContent":"456 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries of-concept device, he was expected to somehow witho ut funding take it beyond that stage through the very expensive stage to a commercial prod- uct. A final product must be engineered and fine-tu ned until it works con- sistently enough to be mass-produced. Today, the Mo ray brothers estimate it would take more than $14 million just to build t he parts used in a Radiant Energy laboratory model (which is not as re fined as a production model); they say that high-priced personnel, expens ive test equipment and huge capital outlay would be needed. Instead of a factory producing Radiant Energy units , Henry Moray had one model which he tore apart—\"cannibalized\"—to re- use its expensive parts whenever he built an improved model. Similar in another way to fellow independent invent ors throughout the century, Moray's experiences with would-be financie rs was discouraging. Moray Products Company, for example, seemed to be g oing well until Henry found out that the company's treasury was bei ng pilfered from within. Stocks were being sold without benefit to e ither himself or the company; the thieves kept no records of those stock down-payments and also ignored offers from investors who would have e xposed the pilfering. Henry Moray took these associates to court. The cos ts bankrupted him, and the company broke apart. To add to his distress, Henry's closest friend, W. H. Lovesy of Utah Oil Refining Company, died under mysterious circums tances in a one-car accident. A hitchhiker who was never identified wal ked away from the crash. Hearing the family talk about so many troubling inc idents for so many years, John Moray was bound to grow up with a griml y determined set to his jaw. From childhood John lived with the expecta tion that he would continue the work his father began. As a boy he wou ld be rewarded for good behaviour by being allowed to go downstairs to the basement labo- ratory in the evening and watch his father experime nt. (In 1939 Henry built a 50-foot by 60-foot laboratory with four roo ms above it, and the workshop was moved outside of the house permanently ). Around 1950, Henry and his grown sons sat down to b rainstorm a plan for financing Radiant Energy development. Richard v olunteered to go to Canada and invest in land, and Henry and John staye d in Salt Lake City. Richard and his family found it more difficult than expected—battling bureaucracy in British Columbia in an attempt to de velop a subdivision was not always successful. John had planned to go i nto electrical engi- neering, but found that the University of Utah phys ics department was more flexible in allowing him to choose courses. Nearing the end of his lifetime, Henry Moray became \"more and more amazed,\" wrote John, \"for he had never believed he could really be stopped.\" Dr. T. Henry Moray passed on in l974."},{"pageNumber":465,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Fuel Savers and Alternate Energy Resources 457 Interviewed in 1994, John Moray was (in his sixties ) a retired army colonel now working full-time as a substitute teach er in Salt Lake City, getting up before 5 A . M . to work on correspondence, and thinking of sell- ing the laboratory. The family had by no means aban doned Radiant Energy, he said; keeping within their budget they c ontract out work on the project. One time-waster, the family has discov ered, is battling at rumours. The latest wild tale which John heard was that there was a Moray device in his basement. \"What a ridiculous statement; that is the last plac e we would keep one!\" \"If I had a machine, what good would it do to show people? If they don't believe the tests that have already been run, they're not going to believe what they see anyhow.\" What part did secretiveness play in the fadeout of Moray's Radiant Energy technology? And is secretiveness a result of today's patent office/ attorney/competition-oriented setup? Admitting that his father refused to release specifics about his invention without first getting signed and legal- ly-binding contracts, John Moray wrote in The Sea o f Energy that \"If this is carrying an invention as too tight a secret then why do patent laws require it?\" What factors most suppressed the Moray device? John replies, \"Fin- ances. And also personal animosity, ego, avaricious ness . . .\" The vio- lence? \"It was always over money.\" The ego factor enters when a scientist values a rep utation as an expert more than truthfulness. This was underlined when Ri chard Moray visited Harvey Fletcher Sr. before the eminent scientist di ed of old age. The man had publicly denied that he had seen a working mode l of Henry's inven- tion. Now the scientist was well into his nineties and apparently making peace with his life. \"He admitted that, yes, the Radiant Energy device w orked just like my father said,\" Richard said in an interview, with a look of deep frustration. \"I asked him 'then why, why did you do what you did ?'\" Richard meas- ured out his next words flatly. \"He said 'because I couldn't admit that I didn't know . . .'\" Ego, greed, excessive pride and distrust. Will enou gh people rise above these motivations and see themselves connected with all others in a sea of energy? Perhaps then Radiant Energy units could lig ht up this world.

Jonathan Swift, Gulliver's Travels No other scientific endeavor has consumed so much t alent, so much cash and so many years of sustained effort as the race t o harness the power that makes the sun shine. Billions of pounds (and dollar s, rubles and yen), more than four decades of research and the careers of thousands of physi- cists have been expended on the search for a nuclea r reactor that will gen- erate limitless power from the fusion of hydrogen a toms. There are gray- haired professors with lined faces still poring int ently over the equations they first looked at eagerly with bright young eyes in the 1940s and 1950s. They will go into retirement with their dreams of c heap, safe power from fusion still years in the future, for the obstacles in their paths are as for- midable now as ever. Fusion is the process taking place in the sun's cor e where, at tempera- tures of millions of degrees, hydrogen atoms are co mpressed together by elemental forces to form helium and a massive outpo uring of energy in the thermonuclear reaction of the hydrogen bomb. It is not difficult, then, to imagine how people wh o have invested their talent and their lives in the quest to tame such fo rces are likely to react when told that fusion is possible at room temperatu re, and in a jam jar. Hydrogen atoms repel each other strongly—so strongl y that no known chemical reaction can persuade them to fuse. There are, though, heavier isotopes* of hydrogen, such as deuterium, which tog ether with oxygen makes heavy water and which under the right circums tances can be made to fuse in nuclear reactions. When they do so, they release energy. However, * Atoms that have the same number of protons - atom ic number - but different mass numbers."},{"pageNumber":468,"pageContent":"460 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries the only circumstances so far under which hydrogen atoms have been per- suaded to fuse have nothing in common with the meas ured calm of the laboratory bench but are more like a scene from Dan te's Inferno. In the center of the sun and other stars, the atoms are sq ueezed by cataclysmic gravitational forces to form a plasma of the nuclei of hydrogen atoms at a temperature of millions of degrees. These high temp eratures kindle a self- sustaining reaction in which hydrogen is \"burnt\" as the fuel. The scientific world was thus astonished when, in M arch 1989, Prof- essor Martin Fleischmann of Southampton University and his former stu- dent, Professor Stanley Pons of the University of U tah, held a press con- ference at which they jointly announced the discove ry of \"cold fusion\"— the production of usable amounts of energy by what seemed to be a nuclear process occurring in a jar of water at room temperature. Fleischmann and Pons told an incredulous press conf erence that they had passed an electric current through a pair of el ectrodes made of pre- cious metals—one platinum, the other palladium—imme rsed in a glass jar of heavy water in which was dissolved some lithium salts. This very sim- ple set-up (the Daily Telegraph later estimated its cost as around £90 [$144 U.S. currency]) was claimed to produce heat e nergy between four and ten times greater than the electrical energy th ey were putting in. No purely chemical reaction could produce a result of such magnitude so, said the scientists, it must be nuclear fusion. Fur ther details would be revealed soon in a scientific paper. Both scientists are distinguished in their field, t hat of electrochemistry. But in making their press announcement they were br eaking with the usual tradition of announcing major scientific disc overies of this sort. The usual process is one of submitting an article to Na ture magazine which in turn would submit it to qualified referees. If the two chemists' scientific peers found the paper acceptable, Nature would publ ish it, they would be recognized as having priority in the discovery and— all being well— research cash would be forthcoming both to replicat e their results and conduct further research. But the two scientists perceived some difficulties. First, their paper would not be scrutinized by their exact peers becau se the discovery was unknown territory to electrochemists and indeed eve ryone else. It would probably be examined mainly by nuclear physicists—t he men and women who had grown gray in the service of \"hot\" fusion. This would be like ask- ing Swift's \"Big Endians\" to comment objectively on the work of \"little Endians.\" It is not that \"hot\" fusion physicists co uld not be trusted to be impartial, or were incapable of accepting experimen tal facts, but rather that they would be coming from a research backgroun d that would natu- rally give them a quite different perspective."},{"pageNumber":469,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Fuel Savers and Alternate Energy Resources 461 Fusion Hot and Cold Fusion is the opposite of fission, although both pr ocesses start with atoms. Atoms are the tiny building blocks that make up all matter. An atom consists of a nucleus, which is mad e up of pro- tons and neutrons, and electrons, which form a clou d around the nucleus. Different atoms contain different amounts of protons, neutrons, and electrons, and form different types o f matter. Fission is the splitting of an atom's nucleus, such as by bom- barding it with neutrons. This releases a great amo unt of ener- gy. An atomic bomb and a nuclear power plant both u se fission. Fusion is the joining together of atomic nuclei. Ho t fusion, which is said by some scientists to be what energiz es our sun, uses a form of the lightest element, hydrogen. Textbooks teach that temperatures reaching millions of degrees Fahrenheit are needed before the positively charged hydrogen nuclei can overcome their natural repulsio n toward each other, since like charges repel—think of what happens if you attempt to bring the north poles of two magnets together. If the hydrogen nuclei do come close enough together, they form something different—helium nuclei. In the process, tremendous amounts of energy are released. Instead of using super-heated gas, cold fusion seem s to be based on the reaction of a metal such as palladium, which has large spaces between its nuclei, and a liquid form of hydrogen called deuterium. The deuterium seems to move into the spaces within the palladium in the same way that wa ter moves into the open, absorbent surface of a towel. While no one dis- putes the fact that the metal absorbs the deuterium , cold-fusion proponents cannot prove that the reaction which fol lows the absorption is a nuclear reaction. Cold fusion is not without problems. For example, o ne of the byproducts of cold fusion is the radioactive gas tr itium, a rare form of hydrogen. As one new-energy organization ha s noted, cold fusion introduces concerns about radioactivity , and even a low level of radiation can eventually lead to envir onmental and health problems. From The Coming Energy Revolution by Jeane Manning (Garden City Park, NY: Avery Publishing Group, 1996)."},{"pageNumber":470,"pageContent":"462 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries There was also the problem of money. Whoever develo ps a working fusion reactor—hot or cold—will be providing the so urce of energy that mankind needs for the foreseeable future: perhaps f or hundreds of years. The patents involved in the technology, and the hea d start the patent own- ers will have in setting up a new power industry, w ill be worth many bil- lions of pounds in revenue. It is potentially the m ost lucrative invention ever made. With such big sums at stake, the scienti sts' university wanted no future ambiguity about who was claiming priority , and hence encour- aged them to mount a very public announcement. In the end, the two scientists agreed to a press co nference that would stake Utah University's claim to priority in any fu ture patent applications, followed by publication of a joint paper in their o wn professional journal, The Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry. There followed a brief honeymoon of a week or two, during which newspaper libraries received more requests from the newsroom for cut- tings on fusion than in the previous twenty years, and optimistic pieces about cheap energy from sea-water (where deuterium is common) were penned to keep features editors happy. All over the world, laboratories raced to confirm the existence of cold fusion, alth ough many scientists were unhappy at the lack of scientific detail and a t having to learn about such an important event from television news and th e popular press. What these researchers were looking for, with their £90- worth of precious met- als stuck in test tubes, were one or more of the ke y tell-tale signs that would confirm cold fusion. When two deuterium nucle i fuse they produce either helium and a neutron particle or tritium. So , if fusion really is tak- ing place, it should be possible to find neutrons b eing emitted, or helium being formed or tritium being formed. It should als o be possible to detect energy being released, probably as heat, that is gr eatly in excess of any electrical energy being put in. (Of course, if the cell does not do this it is of no use as a power source.) Despite the experimental difficulties it was not lo ng before confirma- tions were reported. First were Texas A & M Univers ity, who reported excess energy, and Brigham Young University who fou nd both excess heat and measurable neutron flow. Professor Steve J ones of BYU said his team had actually been producing similar results si nce 1985, but that the power outputs obtained had been microscopically sma ll, too small in fact to be useful as a power source. One month after the announcement the first support from a major research institute came when professor Robert Huggi ns of California's Stanford University said that he had duplicated the Fleischmann-Pons cell against a control cell containing ordinary water, a nd had obtained 50 per- cent more energy as heat from the fusion cell than was put in as electric-"},{"pageNumber":471,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Fuel Savers and Alternate Energy Resources 463 ity. Huggins gained extra column-inches because he had placed his two reaction vessels in a red plastic picnic cool-box t o keep their temperature constant. This kitchen-table flavor to the experime nt added even further to the growing discomfort of hot fusion experts, with their billion-dollar research machines. By the time the American Chemical Association held its annual meet- ing in Dallas in April 1989, Pons was able to prese nt considerable detail of the experiment to his fellow chemists. The power output from the cell was more than 60 watts per cubic centimeter in the palladium. This is approaching the sort of power output of the fuel ro ds in a conventional nuclear fission reactor. After the cell had operate d from batteries for ten hours producing several watts of power, Pons detect ed gamma rays with the sort of energy one would expect from gamma radi ation produced by fusion. When he turned off the power, the gamma ray s stopped too. Pons also told delegates that he had found tritium in th e cell, another important sign of fusion taking place. Pons estimated that the cell gave off 10,000 neutro ns per second. This is many times greater than the rate of background l evel of natural radioac- tivity, but is still millions or billions of times less than the rate of neutron emission that one would expect from a fusion reacti on—a puzzle which Fleischmann and Pons acknowledge as a stumbling blo ck to acceptance of their phenomenon as fusion by any conventional proc ess. However, despite the reservations, the assembled ch emists were ecstat- ic that two of their number had apparently scooped their traditional ri- vals from the world of physics, and had, in the wor ds of the American Chemical Society's president, \"come to the rescue o f fusion physicists.\" This was perhaps the high-water mark of cold fusion . Scores of organ- isations over the world were actively working to re plicate cold fusion in their laboratories, and although many reported diff iculties a decent num- ber reported success. And by the end of April, Flei shmann and Pons were standing before the U.S. House Science, Space and T echnology commit- tee asking for a cool $25 million to fund a centre for cold fusion research at Utah University. Then things began to go wrong. First, some of the r esearchers who early on announced confirmation of cold fusion now recanted, citing faulty equipment or measurements. Next, an unnamed spokesman for the Harwell research laboratory—the home of institution al nuclear research in Britain—spoke to the Daily Telegraph saying that : ... we have not yet had the slightest repetition of the results claimed by professors Martin Fleischmann and Stanley Pons. Of the other labora- tories around the world who have tried to replicate the Pons- Fleischmnnn result, all but one have recanted, admi tting that either their equipment or their measurements were faulty."},{"pageNumber":472,"pageContent":"464 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries We believe our experiments are much more careful th an those con- ducted by others. Perhaps for that reason we have b een unable to observe any more energy coming out of the experimen t than was put in. And by the time the American Physical Society had i ts annual meeting in Baltimore in May, the opponents of cold fusion w ere gathering strength. Steven Koonin, a theoretical physicist fr om the University of California at Santa Barbara, received rapturous app lause from the physi- cists when he declared, \"We are suffering from the incompetence and per- haps delusion of doctors Pons and Fleischmann.\" It was, however, a chemist, Dr. Nathan Lewis of the California Institute of Technology, who got the loudest applause. Lewis told the delegates that after exhaustive attempts to duplicate cold fusion, they had found no signs of unusually high heat. Nor did they detect neutron s, tritium, gamma rays or helium. By late May, the headlines in both the popular pres s and the scientific press were beginning to carry words like \"flawed id ea\" when the biggest blow of all hit supporters of cold fusion. Dr. Rich ard Petrasso of the Plasma Fusion Center of the ultra-prestigious Massa chusetts Institute of Technology presented the results of a series of int ensive investigations into the Fleischmann-Pons experiment. The fundament al data put forward by the two men, said Petrasso, was probably a \"glit ch.\" The entire gamma ray signal in the Fleischmann-Pons experiment, he s aid, might not have occurred at all. \"We can offer no plausible explanation for the feat ure other than it is possibly an instrumental artefact with no relation to gamma ray interac- tion,\" he told the same reporters who had clustered around Fleischmann and Pons only two months earlier. Dr. Ronald Parker, director of MIT's Plasma Fusion Center, said: \"We're asserting that their neutron emission was be low what they thought it was, including the possibility that it could hav e been none at all.\" Thus within two months of its original announcement , cold fusion had been dealt a fatal blow by two of the world's most prestigious nuclear research centres, each receiving millions of pounds a year to fund atomic research. The measure of MIT's success in killing o ff cold fusion is that still today, the U.S. Department of Energy refuses to fund any research into it while the U.S. Patent Office relies on the MIT report to refuse any patents based on or relating to cold fusion process es even though hun- dreds have been submitted. If Dr. Parker had left his statement there, it is l ikely that the world would never have heard of cold fusion again—or not until a new genera- tion of scientists came along. But having been so s uccessful at discredit-"},{"pageNumber":473,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Fuel Savers and Alternate Energy Resources 465 ing MIT's embryonic rival, he decided to go even fu rther and openly accuse Fleischmann and Pons of possible scientific fraud. According to Dr. Eugene Mallove, who worked as chie f science writer in MIT's press office, Parker arranged to plant a s tory with the Boston Herald attacking Pons and Fleischmann. The story co ntained accusations of possible fraud and \"scientific schlock\" and caus ed a considerable fuss in the usually sedate east-coast city. When Parker saw his accusations in cold print and the stir they had caused he backtrac ked and instructed MIT's press office to issue a press release accusin g the journalist who wrote the story, Nick Tate, of misreporting him and denying that he had ever suggested fraud. Unfortunately for Parker, Tat e was able to produce his transcripts of the interview which showed that Parker had used the word \"fraud\" on a number of occasions. It then began to become apparent to those inside MI T that the research report that Parker and Petrasso had disclosed to th e press in such detail was not quite what it seemed; that some of those in charge at MIT's Plasma Fusion Center had embarked on a deliberate p olicy of ridiculing cold fusion and that they had—almost incredibly—fud ged the results of their own research. The MIT study announced by Parker and Petrasso cont ained two sets of graphs. The first showed the result of a duplica te of the Fleischmann- Pons cell and did, indeed, show inexplicable amount s of heat greater than the electrical energy input. The second set were of a control experiment that used exactly the same type of electrodes, but placed in ordinary \"light\" water—essentially no different from tap wat er. The result, for the control cell should have been zero—if cold fusion i s possible at all, it is conceivable in a jar full of deuterium, but not in a jar of tap water. Any activity here, according to current theory, would s imply indicate some kind of chemical, not nuclear, process. But the MIT results for the control showed exactly the same curve as that of the fusion cell. It was the identical natur e of the two sets of results that depicted so graphically to the press and scien tific community the baseless nature of the Fleischmann-Pons claim and t hat justified MIT's statement that it had \"failed to reproduce\" those c laims. It was these fig- ures that were subsequently used by the Department of Energy to refuse funding for cold fusion and by the U.S. Patent Offi ce to refuse patent applications. And it is these figures that are used around the world to silence supporters of cold fusion. But MIT insiders, such as Dr. Eugene Mallove, were deeply suspicious of the published results. It is usual for experimen tal data to be manipulat- ed, usually by computer, to compensate for known fa ctors. No one would have been surprised to learn that MIT had carried out"},{"pageNumber":474,"pageContent":"466 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries legitimate \"data reduction.\" But what they had done was selectively to shift the data obtained from the control experiment , the tap water cell, so that it appeared to be identical to the output from the fusion cell. When this fudging of the figures became public, MIT came under fire from many directions, including members of its own staff. Eugene Mallove announced his resignation at a public meeti ng and submitted a letter to MIT accusing them of publishing fudged ex perimental findings simply to condemn cold fusion. A number of critical papers were pub- lished in scientific journals culminating in the pa per published by Fusion Facts in August 1997 by Dr. Mitchell Swartz in whic h he concluded, What constitutes \"data reduction\" is sometimes but not always open to scientific debate. The application of a low pass fi lter to an electrical sig- nal or the cutting in half of a hologram properly c onstitute \"data reduc- tion\" but the asymmetric shifting of one curve of a paired set is probably not. The removal of the entire steady state signal is also not classical \"data reduction.\" In the restrained and diplomatic language of scient ific publications this is as close as anyone ever gets to accusing a colleagu e of outright fiddling of the figures to make them prove the desired concl usion. Beleaguered and under fire from every quarter (exce pt the other big hot fusion laboratories who simply became invisible and inaudible) MIT backed down. It added a carefully worded technical appendix to the orig- inal study discussing the finer points of error ana lysis in calorimetry.* It also amended its earlier finding of \"unable to repr oduce Fleischmann- Pons\" to \"too insensitive to confirm\"—a rather diff erent kettle of fish. Although MIT changed its story, it was its original conclusion that stuck, both in the public memory and as far as publ ic policy was con- cerned. The coup de grace was delivered to cold fus ion when the U.S. House committee formed to examine the claims for co ld fusion came down on the side of the skeptics. \"Evidence for the discovery of a new nuclear process termed cold fusion is not persuasiv e,\" said its report. \"No special programmes to establish cold fusion researc h centers or to support new efforts to find cold fusion are justified.\" Just where does cold fusion stand four years after the original an- nouncement? The position today is that cold fusion has been experimen- tally reproduced and measured by ninety-two groups in ten countries around the world. Dr. Michael McKubre and his team at Stanford Research Institute say they have confirmed Fleishma nn-Pons and indeed say they can now produce excess heat experimentally at will. Many other * Measurement of the amount of heat absorbed or rel eased in a chemical reaction."},{"pageNumber":475,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Fuel Savers and Alternate Energy Resources 467 major universities and commercial organisations hav e also confirmed the reality of cold fusion. U.S. laboratories reporting positive results include the Los Alamos National Laboratory, Oak Ridge Natio nal Laboratory (these were the two U.S. research establishments mo st closely involved in developing the atomic bomb), Naval Research Laborat ory, Naval Weapons Center at China Lake, Naval Ocean Systems C enter and Texas A & M University. Dr. Robert Bush and his colleague s at California Polytechnic Institute have recorded the highest lev els of power density for cold fusion, with almost three kilowatts per cubic centimetre. This is thir- ty times greater than the power density of fuel rod s in a typical nuclear fission reactor. Overseas organisations include Jap an's Hokkaido National University, Osaka National University, the Tokyo In stitute of Technology, and Nippon Telephone and Telegraph Corporation, whi ch has announced that its three-year research programme has \"undoubt edly\" produced direct evidence of cold fusion. Fleishmann and Pons are wo rking for the Japanese-backed Technova Corporation, a commerical cold fusion com- pany based in France. Eugene Mallove left MIT to be come editor of Cold Fusion magazine. The Japanese government, through the Ministry of In ternational Trade and Industry (MITI) has announced a five-year plan to invest $25 million in cold fusion research. The Electric Power Researc h Institute (EPRI) in California has spent some $6 million on cold fusion already and budget- ed $12 million for 1992. In addition, a consortium of five major US utili- ty companies have committed some $25 million for EP RI research. Some of these research funds are being spent not on ly on developing a large-scale reactor vessel for use in public utilit ies but also, because of the inherent simplicity and relative safety of cold fus ion, the development of a cheap miniature version for use in the office and even in the home. Even as Harwell and MIT proclaim their impossibility, pr ototype ten kilowatt cold fusion heating devices are already under test and are likely to find their way to market in the near future. It is not only the organizations with a vested inte rest that come out badly from the story of cold fusion. The press, especiall y the scientific press, has acquitted itself poorly. Nature magazine showed how reactionary it can be with coverage that ranged from knee-jerk hostile to near hysterical. Its most intemperate piece was an editorial column in M arch 1990 headlined \"Farewell (not fond) to Cold Fusion,\" which describ ed cold fusion as \"dis- creditable to the scientific community,\" \"a shabby example for the young,\" and \"a serious perversion of the process of science .\" Some sections of the national press were also quick to ridicule Fleisch- mann and Pons and wrote pieces that have now come b ack to haunt their consciences. Steve Connor, writing in the Daily Tel egraph, said that \"the"},{"pageNumber":476,"pageContent":"468 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries now notorious breakthrough in 'cold fusion' only tw o months ago aston- ished scientists worldwide, promising a source of l imitless energy from a simple reaction in a test tube. Mounting evidence s uggests the whole notion is a damp squib.\" Connor went on to ask \"how two respected chemists could apparently make such a blunder?\" He provides an answer with the suggestion that Fleischmann and Pons were the victims of \"pathological science\"—cases where otherwise honest scientists fool themselves with false results. It is, of course, always fun to read about a good s candal, especially when the detractors who are so free with scorn get their come-uppance so poetically. But the aspect of the cold fusion affai r that interests me most is why—exactly why—some scientists felt an overwhel ming need to sup- press it, even to the extent of behaving in an unsc ientific way and fudging their results. Money is the most obvious answer, bu t somehow unsatisfy- ing; they may well have wanted the big research fun ds to continue to roll in year after year, but that cannot be the whole st ory. By enthusiastically embracing this possible new field, any of the world 's fusion research organizations could have increased their research f unds, rather than lost anything. Injured pride is also plausible—men and women are o ften driven to extremes of behavior by such feelings, even includi ng murder and suicide. But it is hard to see exactly how and why the feeli ngs of hot fusionists should be so hurt by a simple scientific discovery. Some interesting clues to this extraordinary behavi or come from exam- ining the reasons that several of the institutions themselves gave publicly for wanting to suppress such research during the de velopment of the affair. The first sounds perhaps the most reasonable. John Maple, a spokes- man for the Joint European Torus project at Culham, Oxfordshire, the world's biggest fusion research centre, told the Da ily Telegraph that a dis- credited cold fusion might produce a backlash that would damage the funding prospects of hot fusion. People in the street often don't know the differenc e. They confuse cold fusion, which we think will never produce any usefu l energy, with the experimental work we are doing at Culham, involving temperatures of hundreds of millions of degrees, which is making sp ectacular progress. These sound [like] very understandable fears, but l ook a little closer at the logic underlying them. The people in the street (that's you and me) \"can't tell the difference.\" The difference between what? The difference between hot fusion (which is real) and cold fusion (which John Maple and his colleagues say is not real). But surely, the is sue is not whether we, the public, can tell the difference between a nuclear p rocess that is real and"},{"pageNumber":477,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Fuel Savers and Alternate Energy Resources 469 Cold Fusion—Investigations Continue Despite Ridicule From Skeptics Cold fusion work continues.

At quite an early stage in the affair, Harwell nucl ear research laborato- ry began to worry about fusion becoming the provinc e of every man. Members of the public were apparently telephoning H arwell and asking for advice on how to perform cold fusion experiment s. \"I have had many odd calls from people,\" a spokesman told the Daily Telegraph in April, \"saying they are going to set it up at home to make it work. One house- wife claimed that she already had supplies of heavy water and was asking me for details of how to set up the experiment. I h ad to tell her it would be extremely unwise.\" The paper then costed the exp eriment at £28 [$44.80] for some platinum, £31 [$49.60] for the pa lladium, £6 [$9.60] for some lithium chloride and £18 [$28.80] for the heavy water. With a few pounds for batteries, test-tubes and the like, the total could come to as little as £90, leading the paper to suggest that co ncern was mounting for the \"retired professors, cranks and housewives\" who they thought might be joining the race to produce fusion on their kitc hen tables."},{"pageNumber":478,"pageContent":"470 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries It is, of course, touching for Harwell to be so con cerned about the safe- ty of the man and woman in the street, but I see an other worrying part of the explanation in this amusing reaction. Anyone wh o interests them- selves in cold fusion is immediately labeled as bel onging to a group that has either lost its marbles or never had any in the first place—\"retired pro- fessors, cranks and housewives.\" Since we, the peop le in the street, pay many millions each year to fund Harwell, it seems n ot unreasonable that members of the public should be able to telephone t o enquire on scientif- ic matters without being ridiculed, patronized or t old, in effect, to mind their own business. It was not long before Europe's most senior fusion scientist, Dr. Paul Henri Rebut, director of the JET laboratory at Culh am (cost, £76 million [$121 million] a year) was offering a word of advic e to the man and woman in the street while also, curiously, disclaim ing any supernatural powers. \"I am not God, and I don't claim to know ev erything in the uni- verse. But one thing I am absolutely certain of is that you cannot get a fusion reaction from the methods described by Marti n Fleischmann and Stanley Pons.\" Dr. Rebut clinched his argument with a single decis ive stroke. \"To accept their claims one would have to unlearn all t he physics we have learnt in the last century.\" Well, we certainly wou ldn't want one to have to do that, would we? Equally illuminating were the remarks of Professor John Huizenga, who was co-chairman of the US Department of Energy' s panel on cold fusion and who came down against the reality of the process. In a recent book on the subject, Professor Huizenga observed th at \"the world's sci- entific institutions have probably now squandered b etween $50 and $100 million on an idea that was absurd to begin with.\" The question is, what were his principal reasons fo r rejecting cold fusion? Professor Huizenga tells us: \"It is seldom, if ever, true that it is advantageous in science to move into a new discipli ne without a thorough foundation in the basics of that field.\" When you consider that his committee's sole functio n was to advise whether or not research funds should be spent to in vestigate an entirely new area of physics/electrochemistry, and that this statement is one of his principal reasons for deciding not to invest such r esearch funds, his re- marks take on an almost Kafkaesque quality. It is u nwise to invest research funds in any new area, unless we already h ave a thorough foun- dation in the basics of that new area? How could an yone ever get any money for research out of Professor Huizenga's comm ittee? By proving that they already know everything there is to know?

You could only record the one wire at a time, whereas with discs they could make as many as they want- ed off the one die. \"So I left it. If I'd worked on it further, I would have come up with the tape,\" he says with a laugh. There's a fair bit of humour deep down inside Archi e Blue, an inventor since he was about nineteen. An electrician by trad e, he's applied for dozens of patents, including one which was granted him and his friend Ross Wood in 1939 for \"improvements in or relating to TV or like appa- ratus.\" Another, which has been used a fair bit, was for a round corrugated disc to keep speaker cones in shape. He sold the design for an automatic switch to an American company, years ago. There were other things, too. So long ago it's hard to remember them all without getting all the papers. \"I've made hard ly anything from my inventions,\" he says. But he hopes to make something from his latest, a d evice originally intended to be a source of cheap fuel. . . He's appli ed for separate patents for that. \"When I started work on it, four or five years ago, I was investigating the use of hydrogen as fuel for a heater.

He says he's proved they are. He came back to Christchurch from Guernsey just before Christmas. There, helped by three retired millionai re friends, he had fitted his device to a small van and driven it around, usi ng only water for fuel. The sceptics had a field day. Scientists admitted i t was possible to get the hydrogen from water and use it as a fuel but the co st and equipment need- ed made it completely impractical. Newspaper reprot ers, as is their wont, made Archie headlines. Several, though, took his claims seriously. The mot oring man for the Daily Mail, Michael Kemp, made two trips to Guernse y to satisfy his curiosity. He didn't get far the first time. But hi s second visit of three or four days dispelled initial scepticism. He reported on the paper's motoring page on August 19 last year that he drove the van himself, in normal traffic, at speeds up to 35 miles an hour. Until the air blower burned out, the engine was \"li vely and powerful,\" he wrote. The Royal Automobile Club man on the island, one Da vid Hooper has taken a keen interest in all the proceeding and is convinced of its success. Since his return Archie has worked steadily away in the cramped shed which is his workshop to make a similar device to s how New Zealand. Amid boxes of tangled wires, innards of old radios, bits of television sets, gramophones, Archie has soldered and welded. He's cut copper pip- ing, fitted it to a large jar, set it up with the a ircleaner and pump on a base. That little red pump will, say Archie, eventually b low hydrogen through what was once a conventional carburettor [sic]—now cut down, float removed, new controls affixed. Hydrogen is produced in the jar by elec- trolysis. \"It takes very little juice, about l!/2 a mps,\" he says, stopping to point out the virtues of his modern multi-function lathe. It reminds him of the time he lived and worked in N ew York. In the late fifties, he says, taking off his fur cap to scratch a smooth head, he went to America with one of his inventions. He was working with a German who offered to get him a job so he could stay on and wo rk on the thing.

The Pacheco Bi-Polar Autoelectric Hydrogen Generato r is a unique system which separates hydrogen from seawater (the element's natural storage tank) as it is needed for use. The patent t eaches the on demand autoelectrolytic separation of 99.98 percent pure h ydrogen from seawater at both electrodes of the generator, and the simult aneous use of the hydro- gen's carried energy. Research and development of hydrogen as an energy s ource, till now, has been blocked by several factors: 1. It is an extremely volatile element and subject to explosion as hap- pened in the tragic Hindenberg accident and the Cha llenger; 2. The existing highly pressurized, cryogenic and hydr ide systems avail- able for storing it are very expensive, cumbersome, and dangerous (there is no need for storage with the Pacheo syste m); 3. The United States Department of Energy is not inter ested in promoting or developing new energy sources that compete with the powerful energy monopolies now in place. Hydrogen is the cleanest burning fuel. When burned, its waste is clean water vapor which can either be recycled back in th e system for reuse, or safely released into the environment and returned t o the oceans, lakes and rivers—no greenhouse gasses, no atomic pollution, n o acid rain, no crippling dependencies on foreign oil, no expensive transport ation, or power lines."},{"pageNumber":485,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Fuel Savers and Alternate Energy Resources 477 The oxides of the two metals used in the system whi ch produce hydro- gen at both electrodes are also recyclable (with a minimal 0.25 percent loss). The metals can be produced for use in the system fr om existing scrap met- als actively seeking markets. The infrastructure ne cessary to develop this clean, safe, and efficient alternative energy sourc e is already in place. Pacheco has built prototypes which have successfull y fueled a car, a motorcycle, a lawn mower, a torch, and a boat (with the ocean serving as its inexhaustible fuel tank). Another prototype sys tem in demonstration energized an entire home in West Milford, New Jerse y, providing electric energy and fuel for cooking and heating. In additio n, Mr. Pacheco demon- strated his generator to the scientific community a t the 1990 Eighth Annual International Hydrogen Energy Conference whe re he was the only exhibitor actually producing hydrogen. His generato r was also exhibited in Canada at the 1990 Green Energy Conference, and at many other notable conferences where he received several award s for his work. HISTORY OF THE GENERATOR As a young man in his native country Bolivia, Pache co was fascinated with the idea of developing a super battery. While experimenting in his makeshift laboratory, he lit a match and the bubble s forming in one of the beakers ignited and blew a hole in the ceiling. He knew that he had made a discovery but was not sure what he had discovered . He abandoned his work with the battery and proceeded to develop his hydrogen generator. In 1943, while on a Good Will Tour of South America , the Vice President of the United States [Henry Wallace] witn essed the Pacheco gen- erator running an automobile. Wallace invited him t o bring the generator to Washington where, later in that year, he demonstrat ed it to scientists and representatives from the U.S. War Department at the Bureau of Standards. He applied for a patent, but because the United Sta tes was at war, all patents were sealed and available only to the milit ary. Later, he was advised to shelve his patents because, at that time , oil was plentiful and cheap and there was no need to develop an alternati ve source of energy. Pacheco became a U.S. citizen and brought his famil y to his newly adopted country, knowing that one day, the time wou ld be right for his invention. He worked in defence plants during the w ar, and then, until retirement, as a heating engineer in New York City. He discovered the beauty of West Milford, New Jersey, while on a fami ly outing and returned for vacations whenever he could. In 1967, he moved with his family to West Milford and made his home there unti l his death in 1992. During the oil shortage in the 70s, Pacheco decided it was time to apply for his patent again and received a U.S. and severa l foreign patents. But, he soon learned that neither the energy industries, the heavily subsidized"},{"pageNumber":486,"pageContent":"478 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries utilities, nor the Department of Energy were intere sted in developing clean, abundant, safe energy from hydrogen. Determined to bring his invention to the people, he built prototypes and demonstration models to show government and industr y officials. Many came and saw, said they were impressed, promised to help, but none ever did. In 1974, with the hopes of acquiring governmen t backing, Pacheco demonstrated his pollution-free hydrogen fuel cell to Congressman Robert Roe, who today speaks often of the wonders of hydro gen fuel. With no outside power source, the self-taught chemical engi neer connected the fuel cell to an alternator unit with a 3 horse powe r, 1000 watt generator with a 4 stroke engine. The demonstration was a suc cess and the excited congressman promised to bring it to the attention o f Washington officials. Upon leaving Roe's Paterson office, Pacheco invited him to participate in another demonstration at the Jersey Shore. Roe was invited to take part in a history-making voyage, the first power boat ride \"fueled by seawater.\" Many newspapers were invited as well. But, Roe neve r showed up, nor did very many newspapers. Pacheco never heard from the Congressman again, but his voyage was a great success. History was made on July 27, 1974 when a 26 foot in-board power boat ran for nin e hours using the Pacheco Generator and seawater for fuel, putting ba ck into the ocean, as its waste, clean water. In an effort to overcome the skepticism he was faci ng and the Ph.D. he could not add to his name, Pacheco had his inventio n analyzed by sever- al independent laboratories. It passed all tests bu t when he tried to intro- duce it to the automobile industry and the oil comp anies, the response was either cool or non-existent. After a two hour meeti ng with one of the oil companies, he was told that developing the generato r would be against their interests. In 1977, Pacheco built a prototype unit which provi ded hydrogen, elec- tric and thermal energy for a 1000 square foot home in West Milford. The New Jersey Commissioner of Energy, and several of h is staff members came to see and were impressed. The Commissioner wr ote a letter of rec- ommendation to the Department of Energy, but again nothing happened. In an effort to bring the generator to the public's attention, Pacheco contacted Geraldo Rivera who expressed great intere st after he had read about the power boat demonstration. Rivera wanted t o do a TV show about the generator, but the idea was axed by the s tation. It was during this time that Pacheco received some recognition for his work at the International Inventor's Exposition. He was the recipient of a plaque and award from the Commissioner of the Paten t Department and two consecutive Hall of Fame awards from the Invent or's Club of America in 1978 and 1979."},{"pageNumber":487,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Fuel Savers and Alternate Energy Resources 479 In 1980, Pacheco was contacted by 60 Minutes, who p romised to help him show his invention to millions of Americans. Th e 60 Minutes crew arrived in West Milford and taped the generator pro ducing hydrogen fuel for a bunsen burner, and for a torch which cut thro ugh a 3/4-inch-thick steel plate (indoors). The hydrogen gas inflated a balloon, and produced energy to run an electric motor. The last of his de monstrations involved running a lawnmower with the fuel. Because he was g oing to be on tele- vision, at the last minute, he decided to buy a new one, and did not have time to test it out. The engine choked due to the e xcessive amount of gas being produced but the 60 Minutes crew assured him that they had enough material to present an entire show with the success ful demonstrations. Later when the show was aired, Pacheco was devastat ed as the show had a completely different focus. The only demonstratio n aired was the lawn mower, and it was used to provide an example of an independent inven- tor's non-working invention. In 1986, with increasing concerns about the environ ment, Pacheco wrote to the Department of Energy about the generat or but received only a fact sheet in response which provided information on the drawbacks of hydrogen fuel based on the problem of storing it in liquid or gas form. He wrote back explaining that with his system, there i s no need to store the hydrogen as it is produced on demand. His detailed response was ignored. In 1989, after information about the generator was presented at a United Nations Environmental Conference, Pacheco wa s invited to exhib- it a prototype in Canada at the Green Energy Confer ence. Subsequently, he was asked to participate in the International Hy drogen Energy confer- ence held in Hawaii in 1990. Encouraged by the inte rest from several sci- entists, he applied for the new patent which he rec eived in February, 1992. Though the history of his technology is most intrig uing, its future is more important. Its potential clean, renewable, and safe energy source represents long-sought solutions for the environmen tal degradation caused by existing energy sources. Although Mr. Pac heco had been dis- couraged and frustrated in his efforts to bring thi s technology to the peo- ple, he remained focused and committed to the end. He strongly believes in the words of an old wise man who once told him, \"Son, God put on your shoulders something very big, do not ask yours elf 'Why me?'

As far back as the m id 20s, Moore's sys- tems were found to be capable of virtually eliminat ing carbon monoxide pollution. Persons involved in the automotive field viewed Moore as an authentic genius and could not understand why the i ndustry ignored his advanced automotive designs.

It supposedly raised mileage by 25 percent and reduced pollution by 45 per- cent. Its inventor, Joseph Bascle, was a well known Baton Rouge researcher who remodified every carburetor in the l ocal Yellow Cab fleet shortly after his arrival there. In the 1970s he wa s still optimistic and hint- ed that the time had come for selfishness to be put aside in regard to fuel systems. Kendig Carburetors In the early 70s a small concern in the Los Angeles area turned out a num- ber of remarkable Variable Venturi Carburetors. Mos t of these were hand made for racing cars. Buying one of their less soph isticated prototypes, a young college student mounted it on his old Mercury \"gas hog.\" Entering it in a California air pollution run, the student w on easily. Not only did the carburetor reduce pollution; it gave almost twice t he mileage. Within the week the student allegedly was told to remove his c arburetor—it was not approved by the Air Resources Board. Due for produc tion in 1975, the simpler Kendig model has yet to be produced. Super Carburetors In the late 30s there was an inventor in Winnipeg, Canada, who developed a carburetor which got at least 200 miles per gallo n by using superheated steam in its system. C. N. Pogue was quite open abo ut this work until very professional thefts indicated his invention was in danger. Local papers of the time stated that his various backers declined m any outside offers they received, and, toward the end, used as many as five guards protecting their interests. What eventually happened is still unclea r. In the early 40s there was another inventor who dev eloped a design that cost him many years of heartache and \"dead ends.\" J ohn R. Fish was cut off from every direction, and when he finally resor ted to selling his car- buretors by mail, the post office stopped him.

Water-to-Gas Conversion Powder One of the most controversial figures of his kind w as Guido Franch. In the 70s he created a sensation when he began demonstrat ing his water-to-gas miracle. Chemists at Havoline Chemical of Michigan and the University [of Michigan] were among the first to test his fuel . According to both, it actually worked better than gasoline. According to Franch, his secret lay in using a small quantity of \"conversion powder\" which was processed from coal. He stated that he processed coal in a series of barrels containing liq- uid. Supposedly, as the \"processed\" coal sank to th e bottom, a greenish substance rose to the top. It is this residue that was dried into the mysteri- ous \"conversion powder\"! Franch said he learned the formula from a coal miner, Alexander Kraft, over 50 years before. While it cost Franch over a dollar a gallon to make his fuel in small quantitie s, he claimed that it could be produced for a few cents a gallon if mass produc ed. A number of private groups tried to deal with Franc h for his formula. According to some, the inventor was just too diffic ult to deal with, and there was just too much gamble involved for the con crete facts they got. Franch continued to put on his demonstrations for y ears and claimed the auto manufacturers, Government, and private compani es just weren't interested in his revolutionary fuel. Burn Water Back in the 1930s a number of the early tractors sq ueezed great economy from a number of simple adaptions. Some simply used a heated manifold to further atomize the gas; others used cheaper fue ls. The Rumley Oil Pupp tractor had a carburetor with three chambers a nd floats in it. One was used for gas, one for kerosene, and the third w as for water. After own- ers started the tractor on gas, they simply switche d over to a cheaper mix- ture of kerosene and water. With the advent of ultra-sonic devices there were a number of re- searchers in the early 70s who successfully mixed u p to 30 percent water in gasoline—and used to run their automobiles. Some disgruntled motorists just \"spudded\" into thei r carburetors—ran a hose to a container of water and let their engine s suck in an extra water ration. Experts claimed this could damage valves if cold water hit them, but few seemed to have trouble."},{"pageNumber":491,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Fuel Savers and Alternate Energy Resources 483 Gas and Water Mix In the mid-70s a Dr. Alfred R. Globus of United Int ernational Research presented his Hydro-fuel mixture concepts at a meet ing of petroleum refiners in Houston, Texas. According to reports, t his fuel was a mixture of 45 percent gasoline, 50 percent or more of water , and small percentages of crude alcohol and United's \"Hydrelate.\" This lat ter chemical was a bonding agent which kept the fuel's ingredients mix ed. Even though it was estimated that a hundred million gallons of gas a day could be saved through the use of this product, no one seemed to b e interested. Water and Alcohol Motor A Paris engineer ran his private cars on a mixture of denatured alcohol and water according to the French magazine Le Point. Th e forty-nine-year-old inventor-mechanical engineer Jean Chambrin maintain ed that his motor design could be mass produced for only a fraction o f the cost of present engines. As publicity surrounded his achievements t he inventor took even greater precautions for security. Super Mileage Additives L. M. Beam, who had had his super mileage carbureto r bought out back in the 20s, worked out a catalytic vegetable compou nd that produced much the same results. By rearranging the molecules of gas and diesel, he obtained better combustion, mileage, and emission c ontrol. At one cent a gallon he guaranteed his W-6 formula would save at least 10 percent in fuel costs. Refused and rejected by State and Feder al certification agen- cies (Air Pollution and Environmental Pollution age ncies), Beam was finally forced to survive in the mid-70s by selling his formula abroad. The Lacco Gas Additive Formula Eighty percent water, 15 percent gas, 5 percent alc ohol, 2 percent lacco. According to an article in the January 20, 1974 San Bernardino, CA, Sun Telegram, a man named Mark J. Meierbachtol of t hat city patented a carburetor which got significantly greater mileage than was usual. At this time the patent (#3,432,281 March 11, 1969) is bein g held by attorney T. F. Peterson for the inventor's widow, Ola. Highway Aircraft Car One of the more determined crop of radical auto des igners was Paul M. Louis of Sidney, Nebraska. For many years he promot ed aircraft design, streamlining to provide super economy in his propos ed \"Highway Aircraft.\" He called cars of current design \"shoebo xes.\" His first attempt"},{"pageNumber":492,"pageContent":"484 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries at marketing a car was in the late 30s. He was stop ped by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and it was not until his c ompany withered away that he was given a clean \"bill of health.\" In the mid-70s at the age of seventy-eight he again tried to put his unique d esigns on the road. Ultrasonic Fuel Systems With the advent of the fuel crisis of 1973 there we re a number of experi- menters who found solutions involving the use of ul trasonic fuel systems. Much of this work involved using sonic transducers to \"vibrate\" existing fuels down to much smaller particles. This procedur e simply increased the surface area of the fuel and made it work more effi ciently. Using a mag- neto-strictive or piezo-electric vibrator, conical or cylindrical cones were used at from twenty to forty thousand vibrations pe r second. An increase in fuel mileage of at least 20 percent was expected of these units. Eric Cottell was one of the first persons to procla im the fact that water could be mixed with gas and used as fuel with these units. His customers had been using his commercial units to emulsify foo ds, paints, and cos- metics for some time. When the word suddenly got ou t that the super fine S-onized water would mix perfectly with up to 70 pe rcent oil or gas, there was congratulations from many sides (June 17, 1974, Newsweek). Later there was nothing but silence again. Later in 1975, Cottell was interviewed again and ex plained that Detroit was so myopic that they would probably turn down ev en the wheel if it were a newly offered invention. Because installations of his reactors was so sim- ple, Cottell ran several of his own cars on a water -gas mixture. He explained that an ultra-sonic unit caused internal stresses s o great in gasoline that the molecules can actually absorb water to become a new type of fuel. Super Mileage from Fuel Vaporization L. Mills Beam developed a simple heat exchange carb uretor back in 1920. In principle it was nothing more than a method of u sing the hot exhaust gases of an engine to vaporize the liquid gas being burned. Using simple logic Beam reasoned that raw gas going through a no rmal carburetor sim- ply could not be atomized with high efficiency. As a result there was a waste of fuel when microscopic droplets burned inst ead of exploded. This, of course, created unnecessary heat and inefficienc y. Since he was easily able to double and triple the g as mileage of the cars he tested, it was not long before Beam was offered a settlement and per- centage fee for the rights to his device. Accepting the offer, he never again saw any attempt to market his device or the parties who gained control of his device."},{"pageNumber":493,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Fuel Savers and Alternate Energy Resources 485 In his \"Suppressed Inventions,\" Mike Brown spoke wi th Mr. Beam and found that the shadowy trail seemed to lead to a ma jor oil company—but, of course, little could be proved. Brown tells of a later device which used the same p rinciple. John W. Gulley of Gratz, Kentucky, could supposedly get 115 miles per gallon out of his big 8-cylinder Buick, using his vaporizing arra ngement. Typically, this device was assured of obscurity when Detroit intere sts bought it in 1950. In the early 70s there was a device made by Shell R esearch of London that was a bit more sophisticated in design. Vapori zing the gas at around 40°C, a certain amount was allowed to go around the vaporizer to reduce pressure losses. The \"Vapipe\" unit was supposedly n ot marketed because it did not meet Federal emission standards. Another advocate of vaporizing gasoline is Clayton J. Queries of Lucerne Valley, California. According to the Sun-Te legram of July 2, 1974, Queries claimed that he could easily develop an engine which could run all day on a gallon of gas. This inventor claim s that all he needs to pro- duce such a carburetor is money from an honest back er. This same inventor said that he took a 10,000 mile trip across the coun- try in his 1949 Buick for ten dollars worth of carb ide. Building a simple carbide generator, which worked on the order of a m iner's lamp, he said that a half pound of acetylene pressure was suffici ent to keep his car run- ning. Because acetylene was dangerous, he put a saf ety valve on his gen- erator and ran the outlet gas through water to insu re there would be no \"blow back.\" The Alexander Fuelless Car System Robert Alexander and a partner spent only forty-fiv e days and around five-hundred dollars to put together a car that con founded experts. A small 7/8 twelve-volt motor provided the initial power. O nce going, a hydraulic and air system took over and actually recharged the small electric energy drain. The Montebello, California inventors were, a t last reports, very determined that the auto industry would not bury th eir \"super power\" sys- tem. What happened? (U.S. PAT #3913004) One inventor in the 20s used an electric car which ran off high fre- quency electricity which he generated at a distance . Using principles sim- ilar to the Tesla's ideas, he simply broadcast the re-radiated atmospheric energy from a unit on his house roof. Henry Ford, acting for himself and the other Detroi t oil \"powers,\" q u i c k l y bought and quietly shelved this invention. (BSRAJ M-J 1973) John W. Keely reportedly used harmonic magnetic ene rgies from the plan- et to run his mysterious motor. Later, Harold Adams of Lake Isabella, Ca.,"},{"pageNumber":494,"pageContent":"486 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries worked out a motor thought to be similar to Keely's . In the late 40s it was demonstrated for many persons, including Naval scie ntists. After a round of \"dead ends,\" it, too, vanished into the pages of the past. Water to Hydrogen Fuel The process of converting water to hydrogen has lon g been known, and the standard electrolysis method was developed back at the turn of the century. The only trouble has been that it takes a great dea l of electrical current to convert the water over. With a 40 percent efficienc y at best, a lot of people were hoping for the advent of cheap fuel cells whic h would convert the hydrogen and oxygen to electricity at a much higher efficiency. The stan- dard procedure for the electrolytic extraction incl uded using platinum elec- trodes in an acidic water solution—with at least 1. 7 volts of direct current. What gives many hope are reports of early experimen ters who over- came the conversion problems. W. C. Hefferlin wrote of using a superior conversion method back in 1921. According to the re ports, he worked out a method which used a high frequency current passin g through steam. Being associated with some unusual projects made hi m suspect to a degree . . . but there are some who feel he put his discovery to good use despite the continued rejections he faced. Hydrogen is probably one of the most ideal and easi ly adaptable forms of fuel that we could ask for at the present. Becau se it returns to water after it burns in the presence of oxygen, it is also poll ution-free, and a joy to work with. Regardless of adverse criticism, it has been proven to be less expen- sive and dangerous than ordinary gasoline when used in automobiles. An experiment was mentioned in the Alternate Source s of Energy Journal in which a couple of readers ran a car for a short period of time on chemically made hydrogen. Tossing some zinc in a bottle of water and acid (any strong acid), they captured the hydrogen given off in a balloon and manually fed it to their auto later. Actually, feeding hydrogen to a standard auto engin e can be a little in- volved, depending on one's source. I recall a group of California experi- menters who fed their old Model A Ford on straight \"tank gases\" with not much more than some gas pipe plumbing. Later they d eveloped a more sophisticated (oxyburetor) and allowed their motor suction to feed the cor- rect hydrogen-oxygen mixture. To start the engine o n these gases, they allowed the hydrogen to be sucked in first. Later t hey were in need of a variable Venturi carburetor to aid this procedure. It is interesting to note that Deuterium, or \"Heavy Hydrogen,\" is what powers the H Bomb. A pound of this fuel at less tha n a hundred dollars (recent estimates) will produce the power of $75,00 0 worth of fossil fuels."},{"pageNumber":495,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Fuel Savers and Alternate Energy Resources 487 The proposed methods of producing cheap deuterium n ow have already become details of the suppressed past. A classic case of the \"water to auto engine\" system was that worked out by Edward Estevel in Spain during the late 60s. Thi s system was highly heralded, then sank among other such \"high hope\" hy drogen systems. Foul play? Who knows! Hydrogen Generator Sam Leach of Los Angeles developed a revolutionary hydrogen extraction process during the mid-70s. This unit was said to e asily extract free hydro- gen from water and yet be small enough for use in a utomobiles. In 1976 two independent labs in L.A. tested this generator with perfect results. Mr. M. J. Mirkin who began the Budget car rental system purchased rights for this device and hoped to develop it—against the usu al ridicule of a num- ber of scientists. Leach, who was very concerned ab out his security, was said to be greatly relieved by Mirkin's aid. Hydrogen Auto Conversions Rodger Billings of Provo, Utah, headed a group of i nventors who worked out efficient methods of converting ordinary automo biles to run on Hydrogen. Rather than rely on heavy cumbersome Hydr ogen tanks, his corporation used metal alloys, called Hydrides, to store vast amounts of Hydrogen. When hot exhaust gases passed through the se Hydride con- tainers, it released the Hydrogen for use in the st andard engines. Billings estimated that the price might run around $500 for the conversions; gas consumption would be greatly reduced. Because of the nature of this conversion, there eve n seemed to be fa- vourable interest from various auto and petroleum i nterests in the mid-70s. P.S.: In Florence, Italy, an inventor used a specia l tube to divide water in Hydrogen and Oxygen—without the usual electricit y and chemical requirements (unconfirmed 1975 report). Burning Alcohol Around 1910 there were a number of automobiles burn ing alcohol, and for some years it was common to find data on burnin g it in the popular automobile manuals of the day. A number of carburet ors were designed to use alcohol or alcohol and gas. In these earlier da ys, alcohol was almost as cheap as the various benzenes—or what we now ref er to as gasoline. One of the drawbacks to burning alcohol during this early period was the fact that the engines didn't have enough compressio n to burn the fuel at high efficiency. Today's automobiles, then, are alm ost perfectly adapted to using not only the alcohol-gas mixtures but pure al cohol."},{"pageNumber":496,"pageContent":"488 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries Over the years, racing car drivers used cheap metha nol, or nonbever- age alcohol, in many racing cars, and only the avai lability of reasonably priced gasoline kept the practice from becoming mor e popular. In the gas crunch of 1973 only a few (old timers) remembered a lcohol as a fuel. Reluctant as the oil companies were to recognise th e fact, it remained that alcohol could be made cheaply and used without majo r problems. MIT testing at Santa Clara, California, retraced th e steps of conversions worked out sixty years earlier. First it was found that the carburetors need- ed to be heated to properly volatize the methanol. This was done by uti- lizing the exhaust heat or by running hot water to a jacketed carburetor. Next, because methanol conducts electricity, it can set up an electrolytic action which attracts many modern plastics and meta l alloys. Gas tanks, for instance, would often fill with tiny metal part icles which required large gasoline line filters to eliminate a plugged up car buretor. Other idiosyn- cracies included trouble with cars turned to confor m to pollution control standards, and difficulty in starting without a hea ted carburetor. In the early days a dual carburetor bowl allowed st arting on gasoline, but MIT introduced a fog of propane from a small ta nk and valve, operat- ed manually. In the case of a methanol-gasoline mix ture, it was found that only cold weather hampered excellent mixing and per formance. A breakthrough at the Army's Nalick Laboratories in Massachusetts led many persons to believe that a cheap \"methanol from waste system\" was assured. In the early 70s they discovered and devel oped certain fungi which could convert a wide variety of cellulose int o the sugars necessary for producing alcohol. Researchers felt that a ton of paper scrap, for instance, could produce over 65 gallons of high gra de alcohol. Air Powered Cars Because air is non-polluting, and does not tend to heat nor contaminate engines it is used in, it is an ideal power source. The one major problem, however, has always been just how to store enough c ompressed air for lengthy travel. Air has been used for years to power localized unde rground mine engines, and even a number of experimental \"air aut os\" have been suc- cessful. In 1931, Engineer R. J. Meyers built a 114 pound, 6 cylinder radi- al air engine that produced over 180 horse power. N ewspaper articles reported that the Meyers vehicle could cruise sever al hundred miles at low speeds. Compressed air stored as a liquid was later used on advanced air auto designs in the 70s. Vittorio Sorgato of Milan, Italy (Via Cavour, 121; 2003 Senago), created a very impressive model that was received with a great deal of interest from Italian sources.

While few renegade scientists cared to make themsel ves conspicuous by divulging \"maverick\" ideas or \"hush-hush\" projec ts, a number of small journals carried very revealing articles. Individua ls daring to share data on faster than light radio, exotic space drives, nucle ar fission, matter-space- and time theories, New Math, gravity concepts, etc. , could often be con- tacted through current one dollar folios from the p ublisher. The Electromatic Auto Any mention that an electric car could be made whic h could regenerate its own power as it was driven was a joke to most \"expe rts.\" Yet, in 1976, this author actually saw such a car function. Using vari ous standard automo- bile parts and an electric golf cart motor, Wayne H enthron's first model functioned perfectly. Once this remarkable auto rea ched a speed of 20 miles per hour, it regenerated all of its own elect ricity. In normal stop and go driving it gave several hundred miles of service between recharges. The secret to the system lay in the way that the in ventor wired the bat- teries to act as capacitors once the car was moving . Four standard auto alternators acted to keep the batteries recharged. With little official inter- est shown in this remarkable system, the inventor b ecame involved with other persons of equally far-sighted aims and resol ved to make the car available to the public.

Mixing Water With Gas Portugese chemist, John Andrews, gave a demonstrati on to Navy officials that proved his additive could reduce fuel costs do wn to 2 cents per gal- lon. It allowed ordinary gasoline to be mixed with water without reducing its combustion potentials. When Navy officials fina lly went to negotiate for the formula, they found the inventor missing an d his lab ransacked. (Saga May, 1974). INCREDIBLE AND UNUSUAL MOTORS The Bourke Engine Russell Bourke was probably one of the true geniuse s in the field of inter- nal combustion engines. Upon noting the incredible waste of motion in the standard auto engine, he set about designing hi s own engine in 1918. In 1932 he connected two pistons to a refined \"Scot ch yoke\" crankshaft and came up with a design using only two moving par ts."},{"pageNumber":498,"pageContent":"490 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries For over thirty years this engine was found to be s uperior in most respects to any competitive engine, yet it was reje cted by all of the pow- ers that be. This amazing engine not only burned an y cheap carbon-based fuel, but it delivered great mileage and performanc e. Article after article acclaimed his engine and its test performance resul ts, yet nothing ever came of his many projects except frustration and bl ockage. Just before Bourke's passing, he assembled material for a book, and The Bourke Engine Documentary is a most revealing w ork on engine design and on the Bourke engine in particular. The LaForce Engine Edward La Force struggled for years in Vermont to g et backing to perfect his amazing engine. Ignored for years by the automo tive industry, Edward and Robert, his brother, survived on the contributi ons of several thousand individuals who believed in them. His engine design manages to use even the harder to burn heavy gasoline molecules. Curren t engines are said to waste these, and, since they make up to 25 percent of the current fuels, the use of the heavy molecules was a great step forward . According to a Los Angeles Examiner article (Decemb er 29, 1974), the cams, timing, and so on were altered on stock Detro it engines. These mod- ifications not only eliminated most of the pollutio n from the motor, but, by completely burning all of the fuel the mileage w as usually doubled. One Examiner reporter saw a standard American Motor s car get a 57 per- cent increase in mileage at the Richmond, Vermont, research centre. With such publicity, the EPA [Environmental Protect ion Agency] was forced to examine the situation, and of course, the y found that the motor designs were not good enough. Few persons believed the EPA, including a number of Senators. A Congressional hearing on th e matter in March 1975 still brought nothing to light—except silence. The LaForces were interviewed by newspapers and aut o manufac- turers across the world, and even though they only modified the basic Detroit designs; Detroit was not interested. Anyone need 80 percent more mileage? In his \"Suppressed Inventions,\" author Brown tells of John Gulley of Gratz, Kentucky, who turned down a GM offer of 35 m illion dollars when they wouldn't guarantee to market his amazing magne tic engine. Gully built his first model from old washing machine part s, and the patent is still available from the patent office file. Fuelless 15-Cents-Per-Hour Papp Engine One of the most astonishing engine designs of the 6 0s was the Papp engine which could run on 15 cents an hour on a sec ret combination of"},{"pageNumber":499,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Fuel Savers and Alternate Energy Resources 491 expandable gases. Instead of burning a fuel, this e ngine used electricity to expand the gas in hermetically sealed cylinders. Fa r from being complex, the first prototype used a ninety horsepower Volvo automobile engine with upper end modifications. Attaching the Volvo p istons to pistons fit- ting the sealed cylinders, the engine worked perfec tly and showed an out- put of three hundred horsepower. In a December 1968 Private Pilot arti- cle, the inventor, Joseph Papp, claimed that it wou ld cost about twenty five dollars to charge each cylinder every sixty th ousand miles. Sub- scribers couldn't help but wonder why Private Pilot soon changed hands, moved across the country, and failed to foll ow up on this project as promised. Two Chamber Combustion Because very lean mixtures of fuel do not ignite ea sily, there were numer- ous attempts at solving the problem with a separate and smaller compres- sion chamber. By feeding gas separately to such a c hamber, it could easi- ly detonate the very lean mixtures in the larger ch amber. A patent in the early 20s covered this idea and For d perfected the idea shortly after the war. It actually wasn't until the mid-70s that Honda of Japan used the design to make a joke of the various emission control efforts of the U.S. auto industry. (See numerous Po pular Science articles, like 768.4.) Salter's Ducks While confined to his bed a couple of days, an Edin burgh professor doo- dled up a method of using ocean wave action to prod uce an amazing amount of electric energy. Large pods shaped someth ing like a duck sim- ply bobbed up and down in a pumping action that use d 90 percent of the waves' energy. Scale models actually functioned per fectly and indicated that larger units should produce hundreds of kilowa tts. {Popular Science, March, 1977.) Water-Gas Mix (University of Arizona) Marvin D. Martin told the press in 1976 that their University funded \"fuel reformer\" catalytic reactor could probably double a uto mileage. Designed to cut exhaust emissions, the units mixed water with hy- drocarbon fuels to produce an efficient Hydrogen, M ethane, Carbon Monoxide fuel. Letters to their Aero Building #16 L ab brought replies that indicated little of how the units functioned but ga ve indications that the hydrogen was responsible for the great efficiency. From P.O.

Zubris became disgusted with his ailing automobile and decided to gamble a couple of hundred dollars on pu tting together an elec- tric car. Using an ancient ten horse electric truck motor, Zubris figured out a unique system to get peak performance from this m otor; he actually ran his 1961 Mercury from this power plant. Estimating that his electric car costs him less than $100 a year to operate, the inv entor was sure that larg- er concerns would be very interested, and he could hardly believe the lack of response he received from his efforts. In the ea rly 70s he began selling licenses to interested parties at $500. Thirty-five small concerns were interested enough to respond. The Zubris invention actually cut energy drain on e lectric car starting by 75 percent. By weakening excitation after gettin g started, there is a 100 percent mileage gain over conventional electric mot ors. The patent prob- ably doubled the efficiency of the series electric motor. (Patent #3,809,978) Electric Motor One of the startling electric motors designs of the 1970s was the EMA motor. By recycling energy this astounding motor re portedly was able to get a better than 90 percent efficiency. Using a pa tented Ev-Gray genera- tor, which intensified battery current, the voltage was introduced to the field coils by a simple programmer. By allowing the motor to charge separate batteries as it ran, phenomenally small am ounts of electricity were needed. In tests by the Crosby Research Instit ute of Beverly Hills, California, a ten horsepower EMA motor ran for over a week on four auto- mobile batteries. Using conservative estimates, the inventors felt th at a fifty horsepower electric car could travel 300 miles at 50 miles per hour without recharg- ing. With such performance the engine could be appl ied to airplanes, cars, boats, and even electric generators. According to Dr. Keith E. Kenyon of Van Nuys, Calif ornia, he discov- ered a discrepancy in long accepted laws relating t o electric motor mag- nets. When Dr. Kenyon demonstrated his radically di fferent motor to physicists and engineers in 1976, their reaction wa s typical. They admit- ted the motor worked remarkably well but since it w as beyond the \"accepted\" laws of physics they chose to ignore it.

Magna-Pulsion Engine A retired electronics engineer named Bob Teal of Ma dison, Florida, invent- ed a motor which apparently ran by means of six tin y electromagnets and a secret timing device. Requiring no fuel, the engi ne of course emitted no gases. It was so simple in design that it required very little maintenance and a small motorcycle battery was the only thing neede d to get it started. Typically, most persons who had professional backgr ound in this field felt that the machine must be a farce and viewed it and the inventor with sus- picion. After seeing the machine run a power saw in the inventor's work- shop, a number of people were forced to expand thei r thinking somewhat. Teal dreamed up his engine design after working on a science fiction novel. His first model was made to a large degree o f wood and he estimat- ed that it shouldn't cost over a few hundred dollar s to put out larger preci- sion models for use in automobiles. Because he lost an estimated $50 mil- lion invention while he was working on an earlier g overnment project, he was hoping for a better reward on his \"impossible\" magnetic motor. The Hendershot Generator In the late 1920s there was considerable publicity on a device built by Lester J. Hendershot. Through inspiration and an un usual dream this inventor wove together a number of flat coils of wi re and placed stainless steel rings, sticks of carbon and permanent magnets in various positions as an experiment. With later adjustments this devic e actually produced current. According to the reports the inventor had no idea how the device worked and it was often just a case of working by t rial and error to get results.

His unique unpatented wheel worked on a change of tempe rature—as low as 3 1/2°F—and was so simple that anyone with material and a welder could build a full scale model. Using any gas proof tanks around the outer form of the wheel, a simple pipe connection between the upper and lower tanks allows the needed exchange of gas. A warmer lower t ank would lighten as the upper tank collected the vaporized propane—or l ow boiling point gas. While slow, the design gave considerable torque and held great promise for applications in backward areas. It is interesting to note that some of these perpet ual motion machines relied on heavy flywheels. Studies in the 70s concl uded that flywheels were about the most efficient energy storing device available. Better than fuel cells, lead acid batteries, or compressed gas, the flywheel could carry the wasted power of high horsepower and save motori sts big money. In 1972 Lockheed reportedly found that an ordinary iron flywheel spin- ning at around 24,000 revolutions per minute in a r easonable vacuum (anti-friction) worked quite well. In fact, very li ttle research money is required to quickly raise the efficiency of most cu rrent motor drive sys- tems, and Cadac Ltd. of Auckland, New Zealand, has one in production in 1993. Hot and Cold Engine A sixty-five-year-old Swedish inventor made a major breakthrough in the thermo-electric engine field. Because wires of diff erent metals produce electricity if they are joined and heated, there ha s long been a potential in this principle. B. Von Platen's secret breakthrough is said to give more than 30 percent efficiency in motors, and, with a r adioactive isotope for power, it could free it from fossil fuels. In 1975 Volvo of Sweden obtained rights to his power unit. Air Fuel In the 1920s, a Los Angeles (Baldwin Hills) residen t worked out a method to run an ordinary automobile on the constituents o f ordinary air. Working out a system to keep his motors from melting from t he high heat produced by the burning oxygen, he contacted the auto makers . General Motors, acting for the industry, eventually got controlling stock of the small com- pany, and that was the end.

There seems too few reasons why the air system wouldn't work very well in pollution sensiti ve cities. Air fueling tanks at the strategic spots would be simple. In 1973 Claud F.

The wrench shaft was, in turn, hooke d to the wheel of his small cart. By using a battery to pump up his tank, he was able to go some distance at speeds up to 50 miles per hour. Air Powered Engines Back in 1816 a Scottish clergyman, Robert Sterling, designed an external combustion engine that ran on hot air. Since that t ime, many experiments have been made trying to perfect his idea. In 1975 there was a break- through of some significance in the British Atomic Energy Research Lab at Harwell. There they came up with a working fluid pump which was nothing more than a container with an assortment of pipes and valves. This means that solar energy should be capable of pumpin g water—or your hot springs or hot air supply can furnish pumping power . A pistonless version of the Sterling motor was designed by the British A tomic Energy Research Lab. It was connected to a linear (nonrotating) alt ernator and could put out 27 watts of power a day on less than a quart of pro pane. There have been a number of Sterling designs for au tos. Some Eu- ropean firms have run these designs successfully, a nd such nonpolluting engines just hum along under a continuous (not inst ant) combustion. These engines are simple, non-polluting, and will r un on anything from charcoal to sunshine. In the 1930s in Wolvega, Holland, there was a twent y-one-year-old inventor who developed a piston engine which report edly could run for three months before needing recharging. The engine was remarkable in that it ran on hot compressed air. Before he had a chanc e to market the engine, he was sent to a mental institution, and his workin g models disappeared. In the 60s Louis Michaud designed a simple thermody namic engine which resembles the internal part of a huge squirre l cage blower. Sitting so that the vanes were horizontal, this machine def lected the air flow path inward and upward to form a miniature hurricane act ion. Because this sys-"},{"pageNumber":504,"pageContent":"496 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries tern could, theoretically, produce or decrease diff erent types of weather (change temperature and humidity and disperse pollu tion), it could be a very worthwhile system. Harnessing just a fraction of the energy potential from thermal changes on our planet would supply awe some power. Hydrogen Car Engines Many believe that hydrogen is the ideal motive forc e. Containing no car- bon, H 2 can be burned safely in any enclosure and broken u p into safe components whatever the conversion. A number of minor experimental successes proved the worth of these conversions over the years. Some simply hooked up a mixing chamber instead of a carburetor on their car, and they expe rimented with combina- tions of oxygen and hydrogen until successful. In 1972 a UCLA team built an automobile to compete in a \"clean air\" race. Using a stock gasoline engine, they lowered i ts compression rate and made a few alterations to allow for a greater heat build-up. Next, they recirculated part of the exhaust gas to decrease th e excess oxygen and slow the combustion process slightly. The result wa s a success. The only real problem was in the bulky, quickly exhausted ta nks of fuel. Billings Energy Research of Provo, Utah, solved the bulky tank problem a couple of years later when they built a hydride s torage system. Hydrogen is chemically locked in powdered iron titanium and is released when heat from the engine's cooling fluid warms it. With this , or a less expensive Hefferlin System there is little reason for our con tinuing dependence on fossil fuels. Justi and Kalberlah wrote in a 66 French bulletin t hat they could con- vert water to hydrogen and oxygen using DC current and simple nickel, double layer, porous electrodes. Their system could store the gases under 100 atm without a pump being used, and they attaine d a phenomenal 50- to 65-percent energetic efficiency. In 1975 UCLA experimenters ran liquid hydrogen to a standard pro- pane regulator and mixer atop a standard carburetor . In the carburetor they used water to lower combustion temperatures and to act as a combustion and backfire control. (An \"approved\" gas mixer or c arburetor is necessary in California.) Electrostatic Cooling For some reason, when static electricity is played on a red hot object, it will suddenly cool the object. This \"electric wind\" seems to break up the insulatory boundary layers of air, and it will have numerous applications in our century. The \"tabernacle\" [the famous Ark of the Covenant] o f Moses in the"},{"pageNumber":505,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Fuel Savers and Alternate Energy Resources 497 Bible was said by Lakovsky to be nothing more than a large electro-stat- ic generator. While the friction of air against the silk curtains generated the static electricity, the box condensor stored th is energy. Steam Locomotion Who could exclude the beloved steam car from a work like this! In 1907 a Stanley Steamer car travelled down a Florida beac h at 170 miles per hour before a bump sent it out of control. Losing g round to the cheaper gasoline vehicles, a number of the old steamers wer e resurrected and run during the World War II fuel shortages. Even in the 50s a Stanley engine carried one researcher and his newer car across the U.S. for six dollars worth of kerosene. The Doble Steam Auto was probably the first steamer of modern design. Instead of allowing the steam to escape, it recirculated it so that an owner conceivably could drive a thousand miles befo re refilling the twen- ty-five gallon water tank. With less than a minute warm-up owners could get performance equal to the best gasoline automobi les. The amazing Doble engines were guaranteed for 100,0 00 miles, and some owners reported having got a phenomenal 800,00 0 miles from them. From his first auto show Doble got $27 million in o rders. The War Emer- gency Board of the period (1917 plus) discouraged p roduction complete- ly, so Doble was forced to survive abroad building steam trucks for an English firm. Steam power plants have been no problem. Kinetics I nc. of Sarasota, Florida, had a superb engine developed for cars of the late 60s.The Gibbs- Hosick Steam described in Popular Science (February , 1966) was to use a tiny piston motor to give it impressive performan ce. A super efficient steam engine was developed by Oliver Yunick in 1970 (Popular Science, December 1971); another, the HBH in Popular Science , November 1971. One of the most advanced steam turbine designs came from the DuPont Laboratories in late 1971. They used a recyclable f luid of the freon fami- ly. Presumably it contains within its design no nee d for an external con- denser, valves, or tubes. (Popular Science, January , 1972.) Using more basic designs, Sundstrand Aviation put o ne of their steam power plants in a Dallas city bus. At the same peri od William M. Brobeck of Berkeley, California, with his assistants, equip ped three Oakland Buses with similar \"Doble\" designs. Lear Motors Corp. of Reno, Nevada, spent millions o n advanced steam designs until it was apparent there would probably be little financial reward in the end. Steam Power Systems of San Diego was another prin- cipal experimenter during this period. About as close as anyone came to putting a producti on model on the"},{"pageNumber":506,"pageContent":"498 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries market in the 70s was the attempt by W. Minto. Usin g Swedish Sullair rotary compressors for motors, he mounted his syste m on a standard Datsun and got a contract for at least a hundred more. Lat er modifications includ- ed a gyrator engine, which was actually a pump moto r working backward. One of the few new steam engine designs able to be directly tied to the drive wheels of an auto is the KROV design of 1973. Claiming at least a one-third advantage in economy over conventional ga s engines, all this engine needed was financing. I recall that one enterprising gentleman sold a kit to convert gas engines to steam engines during the Second World War. He ra n around Los Angeles in a converted Model A Ford until he droppe d from sight. In the 60s there was a similar conversion kit put out by a small company in Oregon. Furnishing a smaller cam timing gear sprock et the size of the crankshaft sprocket and a modified camshaft, a norm al \"gas\" engine could easily be converted. This company did not advocate using their units for any but stationary engines, but hinted at a new sup er fuelless steam power unit coming up. Another Steam Engine In the early 70s William Bolon in Rialto, Californi a, developed an unusu- al steam engine design that was purported to get 50 miles to the gallon. The engine, which used only 17 moving parts, weighe d less than 50 pounds and eliminated the usual transmission and dr ive train in an auto. After contacting Detroit interests, the inventor cl aimed he was required to sign forms releasing these interests from acknowled ging his claims to the design before they would even look at it. After a Sun-Telegram article on the project, his fa ctory was firebombed to the tune of $600,000. After letters to the White House, the inventor finally gave up and let Indonesian interests have t he design. Aside from a token steam project by Ford, the steam auto was ignored right up to the time of various Senate pollution co ntrol committees of late 60s. Typically, the representatives of the auto ind ustry alleged that steam systems were not dependable, safe, or necessary—esp ecially since Detroit would soon have good minimal emission designs. So, without funding, the small experimenters of this period tended to fa ll into obscurity. A notable exception was Bill Lear, who spent millio ns perfecting sys- tems in his Reno plant. The complete lack of co-ope ration and interest from major industries or \"powers\" eventually discou raged him. Diesel Dr. Rudolph Diesel took the crude heavy fuel burnin g engine designs of those before him and refined them into the major en gineering success of"},{"pageNumber":507,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Fuel Savers and Alternate Energy Resources 499 the 1900s. His invention immediately threatened the whole steam engine industry, and just as he was plunging into fame and success, he perma- nently disappeared from the ship on which he was tr avelling to Europe. Electrostatic Motors The modern world's first electric motor was an elec trostatic motor invent- ed by Benjamin Franklin in 1748. Through the years, little was done in this field until a Dr. Jehmenko came on the scene. This good physicist felt it was a \"waste\" not to be using some of the abundant free atmospheric elec- tricity, so he built the most powerful Corona motor so far tested (1974). He has visions of being able to put his Earth-field antennas on the tops of mountains, where electrostatic energy is particu larly concentrated and use an ultraviolet laser beam to ionize the air and send the energy to receiving sites below. To run smaller motors, exper imenters find that a few inches of needle pointed music wire will start a Corona. This wire is attached to at least two or three hundred feet of c opper lead-in wire held aloft by a balloon, kite, or tower. Tolerances are critical on electrostatic motors, but they are simple to make. Using more conventional research methods, the Argon ne National Labs (Atomic Energy Comm.) spent millions in the early 7 0s developing numerous \"Super Batteries.\" Somehow, as usual, the public gained little benefit from these breakthroughs. FLIGHT AND ANTI-GRAVITY CONCEPTS Anti-Gravity Propulsion A number of researchers contend that if the isoles of the atomic fields in matter are arranged in a linear polarity, they can produce an anti-gravity effect. This is the principal a magnet works under when its molecules are in alignment. The perfect example of this principle in application is the bumblebee. Flying against all aerodynamic principle s, the wings purport- edly produce enough electrostatic polarity bands ar ound the bee's body to carry it aloft. According to some theories anti-gravity can actuall y come from creat- ing any system which will use the confusion of matt er against the orderly flow of energy. In designing a system to use positi ve and negative (night and day, the Ancients called it) polarities against each other, a Toroid coil with a caduceus winding can be used to separate the se fields—and play them against each other. By orienting the poles of the atomic structure of matter instead of the molecular structure (magnet), even nonferrous met- als can gain attraction-repulsion qualities. We should shortly be using propulsion u n i t s which a re little more than"},{"pageNumber":508,"pageContent":"500 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries diaphragms of matter sending out discordant vibrati ons—out of harmony to the resonance of space. (Further data on the wor king of matter from works by Walter Russell and Geo Van Tassel). While the electrical resistance of various metals h as long been affected by super cold temperatures, it was not until the mi d-60s that scientists found a \"breakthrough.\" Niobium with tin zirconium or titanium were found t o produce super- conducting magnets ten times as strong as ordinary magnets. As with the \"live\" metals mentioned elsewhere, such super-conductive characteristics could allow a super magnetic shield for space ships. This would, in effect, act as a force field protector ag ainst dangerous protons and radiation. Super-conductive wire, of course, co uld allow frictionless gyros, and ultra small computers and electrical cir cuits. When larger super-conductive metals act to repel ma gnetic fields, we have an actual \"levitation.\" Vibrations Besides the well-known oracle caves of antiquity su ch as Delphi, there were lesser-known objects used for the same purpose . At Dodona there were vases fashioned of metal that supposedly would ring for hours when struck. It would seem logical that certain tonal ra nges or octaves would, indeed, assist some to blank out unwanted thought p atterns. Pythagoras was the first person history records as working out a rea- sonably sound harmonic musical scale. He was also c onvinced that cer- tain modes or keys had profound effects upon emotio ns. The \"Hard Rock\" music of the 70s then was probably far worse on the listener's well being than the less chaotic music he warned his disciples against. The early Greeks had great knowledge on the use of vibrations, and the priests were able to build highly unique sound cham bers to use in their rit- uals and religious ceremonies. Many persons have felt that all elements have certa in keynotes and, if such a keynote is duplicated, it can disintegrate t he compounds into their various parts. The mystical principle that two exac t things cannot occupy the same space at the same time is valid whether ap plied to a mind system or to a wall of Jericho. According to a number of ancient records, round met al discs of certain shapes and resonance could lift men and objects if sounded. Two such discs were made for the king and queen of Spain by the Aztec ruler Montezuma. About the size of phonograph records, on e of these gold discs was said to be thicker than the other.

The 716 ancient stone discs found in China by the Russians in the 60s were said to vibrate in a peculiar manne r when struck. In a work called Secrets of the Andes mention is ma de of a large disc from ancient Lemuria which was used by the Incas in a sa cred temple. If struck in a certain manner it could supposedly cause earthqua kes; if tuned to an indi- vidual vibrational rate it could transport the pers on to a distant place. The Spaniards found this disc gone when they finally lo cated the temple. Well-known occult writer, Annie Basant, explained i n some of her works, that the gigantic stones moved by the ancients were rendered weightless by a simple application of natural magnetic law. Legen ds of almost every continent give accounts of persons striking objects or singing songs to move themselves or other objects around. In 1971 the conventional spinning gyroscope used in navigation was threatened by a tiny two inch Beryllium copper wire held between the magnetic flux of two electro-magnets. This vibratin g wire created a major breakthrough in this field. (Honeywell). Throughout the ages there have been a certain few w ho have had the ability to match odours to vibratory levels. Even i n the present age there are certain perfumes that are said to use a scale o f odours just as a musi- cian uses a harmonic scale of notes. The mystics of the world have used chants to vibrat e areas of the body to fuller efficiency. A typical chant has a mental, love, and power tone, ranging from higher to lower. Early work by Dr. Oscar Brunler found a direct rela tionship between the output frequency of the brain and intelligence. The Energies Science has yet to understand what we could call the \"other energies.\" These energies—or let's say, \"thi s energy\" can be oper- ated at great distance without any \"grounding\" acti ons by physical bodies. It can even be reflected by mirrors and transported , concentrated, and increased by sound. The mystics referred to this other energy as \"life force,\" and \"Prana.\" Eeman called it the X force. Reichenbach called it \"Odic Force,\" Paracelsus called it \"the mumia,\" and the ancients referred to it in various ways as the \"binding force.\" Frankly, I suspect it is all a part of \"Mind.\" UFOs and Propulsion Systems Back in the 20s a former classmate of Einstein, Tow nsend Brown, teamed up and discovered a new principal of propulsion. It started with a charged condenser on a string and led into miniature flying saucers. It was found that the closer the condenser plates, the wider the area they covered, and the more voltage difference between th em, the greater the resistance to the effects of gravitation."},{"pageNumber":510,"pageContent":"502 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries Brown continued this propulsion work into the 50s a nd is thought to have concluded that three large condensers under a saucer (120 degree control) would be sufficient to make practical flig ht possible. Theoretically, the condensers act in creating a mod ification of the gravi- tational field around a craft and, by using a caduc eus coil to change field polarity, directional guidance can be attained. As late as the early 1970s one inventor in the Nort hwest demonstrated similar anti-gravity discus before Portland TV Chan nel 8 viewers. His \"Sicorsci Aviation\" spent seven million dollars on the project before it all faded away. These and other propulsion systems were all but ign ored, officially. They went against the notions of gravity, for one t hing, and for another, how would the powers that be make money from them? Jets cost millions . . . these systems were too simple. A saucer developed by Germany about 1940 consisted of a wing wheel design in which a dozen variable wings acted in pri nciple like a helicop- ter. The perfect balance required on this design wa s very difficult to attain, but with jet propulsion it was said to be capable o f almost 2,000 kilome- ters per hour. [1,240 miles per hour]. One of the more advanced German designs was said to be powered by a \"Schauberger\" flameless, smokeless implosion moto r. These power plants ringed the craft and tilted at angles necess ary to give direction and speed. By incorporating suction openings at the top of the craft, an added boost in speed came from the vacuum created. Incredible as it may seem, there were many document ations of all this in various reports at the time. A friend of mine to ld of tons of Germanium he found in one such plant. It was in some way conn ected with the drive system of one saucer design. Renato Vesco told an A rgosy author (issue of August 1969) that most of the data on the German sa ucers was taken by British \"T\" teams to Bedford, England, to various s ecret facilities in Australia, and to British Columbia, Canada. After c ontinued work on the better projects, various British sources let it be known in 1946 that Britain would soon have aircraft that would be capable of t housands of miles per hour and need no fuel. By 1960 the Canadians had se t aside 125,000 acres of very remote land in BC for \"experimental aircraf t\" and the word sifted through that \"Canada had some very advanced aeronau tical technology.\" Because the U.S. was unwilling to share the nuclear data she came away with after Germany's fall, Britain and Canada were not about to share their aeronautical data with us. It was their ace in the hole. Huge RAF budgets along with continued sightings of slower and more \" solid\" UFO's has led many persons to suspect that our pilots are ordered not to fire upon such craft with good reason. They are our friends—or may be even us."},{"pageNumber":511,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Fuel Savers and Alternate Energy Resources 503 A certain Hefferlin manuscript entitled \"Rainbow Ci ty\" explains that the hero developed a very advanced space ship and o ffered it to the Hungarians just before Hitler took the country over . Because the Hungarians lacked funds to continue and Germany was closing in, Emery flew two ships to the U.S. and stored them here. After offering them to the U.S. Government, Emery w as rebuffed for a second time; he eventually flew, according to the m anuscript, to a small secret protected valley in the Antarctic. Mention i s made in this work of a fuelless motor which utilizes water electrolysis. It is also pointed out that other alien UFOs, havin g no connection with these projects, commonly exist.* As an example, in unofficial conversa- tions with the various astronauts, certain reports stated that all the early \"moon shots\" had alien visitors following them for a time. But then, this work is not large enough to go into data on such al ien craft. Alien Triad Propulsion Systems A number of UFO reports have these crafts' propulsi on systems using a triad configuration. A typical case involved a Sgt. Moody who was shown a system which used what appeared to be three large crystals joined by sloping rods. According to Moody the alien had told him that \"with a lit- tle thought on your own, this could be developed by your people.\" Electrostatic Anti-Gravity With the help of two electrodes charged with 200 ki lovolts of direct cur- rent, a piece of aluminium foil with a bead of merc ury on it can be report- edly suspended between the posts. Mercury engines a re described in ancient manuscripts from India. Anti-Gravity Henry William Wallace patented an anti-gravity gene rator in 1971, and many experimenters in this field were given encoura gement and help by the new ideas. Wallace's device uses rotors travelling from 10 to 20 thousand revolu- tions per minute and the inventor suggests that the intensity of weight- lessness can be increased by using mercury—just as is mentioned in the ancient Indian manuscripts. * When Will Our Government Confide In Us? As the sp ace projects of earth pushed ahead in the 1960s very few persons were aware of the fact t hat some of our most sophisticated advances came from duplicating the equipment on \"alien\" craf t.

Dean was an amateur experimenter who made modifications to a harmonic drive mechanism known as a \"Buehler D rive.\" Consisting of two counter rotating eccentric masses, the Buehl er Drive is used by industry in generating oscillatory motion or vibrat ions. Because of vari- ous complicated circumstances and the death of the persons involved, nothing ever came out of this invention. No governm ent agency ever showed an interest in it, of course. Early Plight Surprisingly, a number of legends and records exist concerning pre-his- toric flight. A number of these stories concern men who learned the art of flying from their more able \"Gods.\" Emperor Shun in China, for instance, allegedly was able to fly after such instruction, a nd medieval drawings from such early periods are pretty convincing. Hind u writings are filled with \"celestial\" vehicles which transported the kin gs and gods. Other accounts of flying machines are recorded in various ancient records and myths including, it would seem, the Bible. The more mystical works of Phylos and James Churchw ard tell of how some of these ancient airships worked. One desi gn mentioned by Churchward took power from the atmosphere in what c ould correspond to a turbine running on atmosphere gases. He claimed t hat temple records he saw gave specific instructions for building not onl y a very advanced air- ship but its power supply as well. In A Dweller on Two Planets, Phylos explains how so me early airships ran by a balancing of the day and night sides of na ture—anti-gravitation- al forces were matched against gravity to manoeuvre such ships perfectly. Some feel that such forces are beyond our present g rasp because of cer- tain energies unavailable to the Power Sources (Xta ls), but that is a story told elsewhere. The Vedic manuscript, The Samarangana Sutrachara, g ives no less than forty-nine types of \"propulsive fire\" used in the wingless flying vehi- cles of India. This work devoted over 200 pages to describing how to build and fly these advanced ships. Some of the pro pulsion systems used the power of heated mercury, others that of electri cal or magnetic forces. The \"Mahabharata,\" \"Drone Parva,\" and \"Ramayana\" al so give accounts of these \"Vimanas\" and their remarkable ab ilities. According to Dr. Ruth Reyna, there are Sanskrit tex ts in the University of the Punjab that tell of space flights 3,000 B.C. Commissioned by U.S. Space authorities Reyna found that these flights we re considered impera- tive due to the threat of a deluge on earth."},{"pageNumber":513,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Fuel Savers and Alternate Energy Resources 505 Gravity Defying Gyroscopes Edwin Rickman, an English electrical engineer, had recurring dreams about an anti-gravity device in the early 70s. Afte r a patent was obtained on the basic principles, it came to the attention o f Prof. Eric Laithwaite of London's Imperial College of Science and Technology . With certain mod- ifications, this scientist declared in 1974 in pres s releases that this anti- gravity motor should enable us to travel to other s olar systems. Laithwaite Anti-Gravity Machine Prof. Eric Laithwaite of the Imperial College of Sc ience and Technology in England invented an anti-gravity machine in 1975 . Defying the laws of Newton, it depended upon the fact that no energy wa s required to return its two gyroscopes arms to their starting position. Flying Suits The Asian conflicts prodded the development of one man flying suits in the 60s. In his \"Gold of the Gods,\" Von Daniken poi nts out numerous ear- lier models depicted on monuments, tablets, pots, a nd even as Polynesian ritual objects. UFOs Many strange stories have circulated about the flyi ng saucers being built by various governments on our planet. While there i s good reason to believe that alien saucers do exist and do visit ou r planet, there is a sur- prising amount of evidence concerning the models of local origin. Several ancient manuscripts give details on buildin g craft that would fit into the flying saucer category. However, in recent times, the most authen- tic reports come from records concerning the work o f Hitler's scientists. In the few short years that Hitler gave his scienti sts free rein to devel- op technology, there was astonishing progress. Alli ed teams who rushed into the secret underground bases and projects afte r the War were dumb- founded by the technological advancement they found . A small plant in central Germany (M-Werke) was on the verge of pr oducing missiles which could destroy entire U.S. cities. Co-operatio n between G-Works and various other installations produced the \"Kugel blitz.\" This was an advanced lens-shaped craft that destroyed Allied bo mbers by Electrostatic firing systems. It could travel by remote control, seek a target by infrared detection, and remain undetectable on radar screens . According to a num- ber of later Allied intelligence reports, there wer e super turbine engines c ap abl e of running on liquid oxygen or hydrogen per oxide, a gelatinous, organic-metallic fuel - and on even the atmosphere."},{"pageNumber":514,"pageContent":"506 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries More theoretical was a design based upon the \"Lense -Therring effect.\" Here a torus wrapped in a tube of accelerating dens e matter should create a gravity field strong enough to overcome the gravi ty of Earth. Another device possible under the present accepted laws of physics is built of a thin disc of nuclear matter. Such a device is light ly covered in an August 1975 Analog-Science Fact Magazine. In this issue Dr. Forwards mentioned another system . Because any mass with velocity and acceleration can create force (ac cording to accepted laws), a round torus rotating outward on itself should can cel Earth's gravity. Unfortunately, these machines would require quantit ies of dense matter. Because many can't accept the current gravitational theories, there are many theoretical designs which use what we could ca ll negative matter. Because an object of negative would repel an object of positive matter, we would get a principle of great potential. This, of course, would be similar to the \"Day and Night\" energies supposedly used by the ancients, men- tioned elsewhere. In a similar vein, one could theoretically use the polarity of inertia. By changing inertia from positive to negative—or even redistributing it, one might thus overcome gravity. Einstein observed that if the UFO occupants had mas tered gravity, they would also have overcome inertia. Saucers with anti -gravity screens could ignore both gravity and inertia. They can instantly change direction and speed. Anyone who has observed the darting movement s of some UFOs must concede that something is breaking the laws of inertia. There are those who maintain that we live in a cont racting and expand- ing universe of many dimensions. By using technolog y which can con- tract a space craft, for example, the craft cannot only pass into the other dimensions, but pass through less dense materials. Because light rays would be less rapid than the event itself, distorti ons would result—which seem to be well recorded in documented encounters. Will our leaders continue to assume that we are too dense to under- stand? It wouldn't surprise some persons to see the \"leaders\" looking down from advanced craft, in event there were a maj or disaster. Exactly how many Government rooms are filled with d ata on UFOs could be anyone's speculation. What is well remembe red by many is the fact that many samples of strange materials and mac hinery have been handed over to Government authorities. In all of th ese cases, the samples have simply disappeared and have been denied to lat er inquirers. A typi- cal case in 1969 involved a material found by Profe ssor R.

Evidence that a Winnipeg inventor's new carburetor gets over 200 miles to the gallon has caused many pencils to be s harpened by amateur physicists. Where and how does he get the miles? \"Gas savers\" galore crowd the electric belts and th e muscle-builders among the sucker ads in cheap magazines. It is not much of a trick, by get- ting the motor hot, skinning [leaning] the mixture and holding the car at its most economical speed—about 22 miles an hour—to get 50 or 60 miles out of an old boiler that usually turns in only 18 or 2 0 miles to the gallon. But this 200-mile gadget is no gas saver. It is an economizer. It reminds one of the story about the fellow who cascaded two gas savers and had to stop every twenty miles to siphon some gas out of t he tank. In an imperial gallon of gasoline there are 145,000 British thermal units, more or less. This is the equivalent of 113 million foot-pounds, or 57 horsepower-hours.

Long may she p erk, and far may she fly! Patents Block Thieves Taking Gas Economizer Inventor Thinks Theft Is Attempt to Force Invention's Sale Loss of three models of his 200-mile-per-gallon car buretor sometime Wednesday, was reported today by C. N. Pogue, local inventor. Thieves broke into his workshop, located in the Amphitheatr e rink, through a hole in the roof, and escaped undetected. The thieves will gain nothing by their raid, the in ventor told The Tribune today. The invention is fully protected by patents in all principal countries of the world, and its theft will result o nly in delaying Mr. Pogue somewhat in his work of improvement and perfection. Mr. Pogue believes that the robbers, to whom he gav e credit for excep- tionally smooth work, did not take the three carbur etors they stole for any financial gain. He is of the opinion that their obj ect was to discourage the inventor and his backer, W. J. Holmes, to such an e xtent that they would be willing to sell their rights. Offers Turned Down To date, Mr. Pogue said, he had turned down countle ss offers to buy the invention, into which they have put thousands of do llars and Mr. Pogue almost twenty years of work. They prefer to bring i t to perfection them- selves before placing it on the market. Mr. Pogue described the manner in which the thieves accomplished their purpose, as he sees it. \"There must have been two or three of them, and the y probably spent several days in their operations. How they could wo rk here for that time, while the place was guarded day and night, I don't know. I am convinced that they were outsiders, but that they had help fr om someone who knew the ground here well.\" Kept In Workshop Mr. Pogue kept his carburetors and the car with whi ch tests had been made, in a large workshop inside the Amphitheatre r ink. The thieves entered, perhaps through the rink, then climbed to the top of the shop. Here there were traces indicating a prolonged stay by the raiders. There were footprints in the shavings on the roof, and re mains of meals.

Previous Theft Attempted A previous attempt to steal the carburetor in April of this year was unsuc- cessful. At that time thieves stole a car in which the invention had been demonstrated from a garage at the rear of the Amphi theatre. Fortunately, the carburetor had been removed from the car some t ime before. The invention was tested officially last December. In below-zero weather, two prominent Winnipeg automobile men, W. S. Kickley and T. G. Breen, reported 209.6 miles to the gallon.

That was the message imparted to The Tribune by Joh n E. Hammell, millionaire mining official and prospector. Mr. Hammell confirmed the report that a car using t he new carburetor traveled 200 miles on a gallon of gasoline. Just where the old residence and plant at which the carburetor is being tested is located will not be divulged. Gordon Lefe bvre, of Toronto, for- merly automotive engineer with General Motors, is t he personal repre- sentative of Mr. Hammell in the final stages of per fecting the carburetor. \"I have not placed any big stake in this invention and won't until it is perfected 100 percent,\" Mr. Hammell said. \"After it is perfected it will take time and it must be proved as an engineering p rinciple.\" To date the sum of $150,000 has been expended on th e invention, states Mr. Hammell. \"I have hardly started to do anything yet—they've got to show me.\" W. J. Holmes, Winnipeg sportsman, has backed Pogue. \"But if it clicks,\" said Mr. Hammell, \"there will b e all the money required to put it across. I have been approached b y some of the biggest oil and motor men on the continent already. They la ughed at Pogue when he needed help and now they can talk to me. I have signed up the entire undertaking and have made agreements with both Pogu e and Holmes. \"Certainly we have armed guards at the plant where the carburetor is being perfected. Somebody broke into Pogue's shop a t Winnipeg months ago, but even if things were stolen now it wouldn't affect matters.\" \"The carburetor has been tried out on Pogue's own 1 934 Ford 8-cylin- der car. We have driven the car and got surprising performance—running over 200 miles on a gallon of gasoline. But that do esn't yet prove the thing. It is being installed on one of my own cars of the same make as the inventor's—then it will be tried on larger cars,\" d eclared Mr. Hammell. As yet the invention is crudely made and entirely b y hand. It is also costly. It is a slow process in developing. The try ing out of the instrument on new cars will proceed under Mr. Hammell's engine ers.

The Fish carburetor was not only an ec onomizer, it was a performer. Fireball Roberts had one on his car when he won the Indianapolis 500 in 1962. The Fish carburetor was no simple device. The paten t for his 1941 model (send 50 cents to the patent office in D .C. for #2,236,595) covers nine pages of explanations and d rawings. His carburetor had no choke and wouldn't idle very well, which should have been no problem to solve—had he h ad a little more money to develop it. However, Fish was so broke before he died in 1958 that he had to have the mone y for one of his carburetors in advance in order to then turn one out. The U.S. Post Office sent all his mail back with \"fraud ulent\" stamped on his orders when he tried to sell them by mail. \" Fraudulent\" could hardly have been a legitimate reason when no less a manufacturer than Ford admitted that the Fish excee ded their standard carburetor on two separate road tests by 3 2.5 percent and 42.8 percent respectively.

N. Pogue, of Winnipeg, young mechanical wizard who tur ned out a gas-sav- ing carburetor. Pogue may be a nice boy, but his in vention, armed guards and wolf-hound proved too much as a steady diet for Jack Hammell, mil- lionaire mining magnate. Hammell, backer of the carburetor, told about his r eaction to inventors and inventions in an address here Wednesday to the Kiwa nis club. The wealthy mine-owner spoke the day after Professor Alcutt of the Univer-sity of Toronto, had termed \"impossible\" the claims made fo r the Pogue invention. \"My engineers like it,\" said Hammell, \"but I don't know.

From Popular Science, August 1922 Three hundred miles on a gallon of oil—10 times the mileage possible for the usual present-day motor! Such is the astounding record claimed for a crude-o il engine developed by Harry H. Elmer, of Syracuse, NY, for use in auto mobiles, airplanes, ships, and lighting systems. In experiments, the en gine has generated suf- ficient power to run a battery of 18 incandescent l amps 18 consecutive hours on 1 1/4 pints of oil, costing less than a ce nt. Because this mechanical marvel does not require a c ooling system, government officials, it is reported, are studying the possibility of its use in dirigibles. Among more than 300 radically new features claimed for the engine, the most important are these: It contains only 64 parts and has only three adjust ments. It has no spark, carburetor, wiring, nor any sort o f ignition. The cylinder has a bore [interior diameter] of 3 1/ 4 inches and a six-inch stroke, yet the engine, it is said, has developed 2 00 percent more power than internal combustion engines of the same size, and will pick up almost instantaneously from 100 to 2800 revolutions a minu te. How the Motor Operates The new engine is described as a four-cycle motor, the cycles being suc- tion, compression, expansion, and exhaust. The crud e oil is led through needle valves into [the] mechanism, where it mixes with air and then, through another valve of the same kind, is drawn in to the motor head, where it is compressed by the upward stroke of the piston. On compres- sion the oil is \"cracked\" by chemical process and t he expansion of gases 515"},{"pageNumber":524,"pageContent":"516 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries takes place. As the piston is forced down the exhau st port is opened, and the incoming charge forces out the expanded gases. There is no combustion in the cylinder, though hydr ocarbon gas, escap- ing the exhaust, explodes on uniting with atmospher e. The engine has been operated with equal success on mineral, animal, and vegetable oils. SEWER GAS SERVES AS FUEL From Modern Mechanix Municipal trucks and other heavy vehicles operating in Berlin, Germany, are being equipped with motors that enable sewage g as to be used as a fuel. Several sewage gas tanking plants have been e rected, where the gas is compressed and stored in tanks for future use by truckmen. Three of the tanks, each with a capacity of 500 cub ic feet of the sewage gas, will operate a five-ton truck at normal speeds for a distance of about 225 miles. LIFE-LONG BATTERY STARTS TEST CAR 606,969 TIMES IN YEAR-LONG \"TORTURE TESTS\" By Dr. J. Morgan Watt From Science and Mechanics Here is a story typical of how American ingenuity i s constantly at work to create new products that make life simpler and easi er for all of us. The beginnings of the story go back more than 100 years to the original European invention of the storage battery and its g radual development and improvement. Thomas Edison predicted a lifelong bat tery as long ago as 1889. But it was not until World War II that a capt ured Rommel tank revealed that a remarkable battery had been perfect ed, good for an incred- ible 40 years or more of service! Readers Digest told about this German-type battery in 1948. They also reported on the action of the U.S. Government in br eaking up, through the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, the international cartels w hich had prevented the manufacture of the European battery in this country . About two years ago, an American company finally marketed the Life-Long 10-Year Battery, the logical outgrowth of the most advanced European and American developments. The American-made Life-Long Battery c ompares favor- ably with its European predecessor. In addition to the manufacturer's own rigorous test program to prove this, independent laboratories investigated the new battery thoroughly. For example, a leading commercial laboratory subjec ted a Life-Long Bat- tery to one of the most unique series of torture te sta ever devised. Every 15 seconds, day and night without pause for 12 long months, the battery"},{"pageNumber":525,"pageContent":"The Suppression of Fuel Savers and Alternate Energy Resources 517 started a test engine. At the end of the test, the battery had made the fan- tastic total of 606,969 consecutive starts! This is equivalent to starting your car thirty times every day for fifty years! The Life-Long Battery was also subjected to extreme heat and cold tests. For example, it was frozen in a block of ice for 48 hours at 70° below zero. The moment it was broken out of its icy prison, it performed with its usual efficiency! The secret of the Life-Long 10-Year Battery's great power and long life is the sintered Cadalloy plates (derived from Cadmi um); indestructible capillary separators which keep plates moist and ac tive; and the special mild-type electrolyte eliminating the strong acids that ordinarily corrode the inside of a battery.The Life-Long Battery diffe rs from ordinary lead- acid batteries in other ways as well. What does the Life-Long Battery do for you? It make s your car lights up to 50 percent brighter. You get faster, surer st arts in all weather which means more efficient use of gasoline. You need add water only once a year, giving you a truly attention-free battery. Mo st important advantage is the 10-year service period, guaranteed by the fa ctory. The bonded guar- antee is backed by a state licensed company and rem ains in effect no mat- ter how many times you transfer your battery from c ar to car, for the seri- al number of each Life-Long Battery is permanently registered for your protection. Surprisingly enough, Life-Long Batteries cost no mo re than ordinary premium batteries. 6-volt Life-Long Auto Batteries are just $29.95 and 12-volt, $34.95. INVENTOR'S MYSTERIOUS MOTOR RUNS ON POWER DRAWN PROM ATMOSPHERE From Popular Science, October 1952 When Cmdr. Ivan Monk, who designs big turbines for the Navy, is pestered by inventors of perpetual-motion machines, he points to a device on his desk that goes them one better—for it works. It is a wheel that spins with no apparent source of power. Commander Monk bu ilt it in his spare time, and patented it, since it may find use in clo cks, toys and advertising displays. Actually it is a rotary heat engine, run by tempera ture difference be- tween its parts. The wheel is at room heat; the lon g cloth-covered hub, kept dampened with water, is cooled by evaporation. A low-boiling-point liquid, Freon, circulates between wheel and hub, va porizing in the wheel and condensing in the hub. Valves maintain an unequ al weight of liquid on opposite sides of the wheel and gravity does the rest, to turn it."},{"pageNumber":526,"pageContent":"518 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries INQUIRY INTO INVENTION ATTACK LINK From New Zealand Press Association, Wanganui, 1994 Police are investigating whether a man was beaten u p to \"silence him\" over his work on the development of a water-fuelled engine.

A Maori warden on patrol found Mr. Whitford unconsc ious in a park- ing area behind a building at the corner of Taupo Q uay and St. Hill Street about 10:40 P . M . on Saturday. He was admitted to Wanganui Hospital i ni- tially to the intensive care unit.

All inventors listed below carry one or more patents in the Unite d States patent office. BROWN, TOWNSEND T. Brown conducted gravity research for over thirty ye ars. He has postulat- ed that there is a definite link between gravity an d electricity. There are many other patents listed that involve gravity and electricity and their peculiar relationship (electro-gravities research). See Ether-Technology: A Rational Approach to Gravity Control by Rho Sigma a nd High Energy Electrostatics Research publications. See patents ( 1,974,483) (2,949,550) (3,018,394) (3,022,430) (3,187,206) (3,223,887) (3, 518,462). CARR, OTIS T. In Return of the Dove by Margaret Storm, O. T. Carr is mentioned having developed an \"anti-gravity flying saucer\" and actua lly started a company which dealt with \"free energy.\" Supposedly, certain secrets of his \"free energy\" device were incorporated in his \"Amusement Device\" patent (2,912,244) which resembles a conventional disc-sha ped flying saucer. A few years ago, Carr was advertising his model A-Xl energy system that produced 15,000 watts from an input of only 500 wat ts. Return of the Dove can be obtained from Health Research. An artic le also appeared in TRUE, January 1961 titled \"Otis T. Carr and the OTC -X1\" by Richard Gehrman. Patent and article available from Biago Co nti, RO. Box 1014, Carmel, NY 10512. FISH, J. R. This is the famous Fish carburetor which guaranteed at least 20 per- cent better gas mileage than old-style carburetors.

Our sources indicate that the unit was last being sold by Fuel Systems of America, Box 9333, Tacoma, Washi ngton 98401 (206) 922-2228. See patents (2,214,273) (2,236,595) (2,77 5,818) (2,801,086). FLANAGAN, PATRICK Authored an excellent book titled Pyramid Power, on e of the first on the market researching pyramid energy. His patent (3,39 3,279) is a device that claims to transmit sound directly to the brain by-p assing the audio-neural system. Not only would this be a benefit to the han dicapped, but one would be able to communicate with another in a very high noise environ- ment. One could still wear noise mufflers which wou ld not interfere with this type of communication. See patents (3,393,279) (3,647,970). Send inquiries to: 1109 S. Plaza Way, Suite 399, Flagsta ff, AZ, 86001. GRAY, EDWIN V. Patented a motor that requires no fuel and produces no waste. An article appeared in the June 1973 issue of Probe the Unknow n, titled \"The Engine That Runs Itself published by Rainbow Publications, 1845 Empire Avenue, Burbank, CA 91504. Unique Technologies, PO Box 56, Richland, MI 49083 also sells \"Energy Creation\" tha t describes this invention in layman's terms. See patent (3,890,548) . HIERONYMUS, T. G. This is the well known patent which uses the force that Hieronymus calls \"eloptic energy.\" This energy has characteristics o f both light and elec- tricity. Many radionic units are fashioned after th is basic design. Articles written by Hieronymus can be found in the United St ates Psychotronics Newsletter, available at P.O. Box 22697, Louisville , KY, 40252 and also in Advanced Sciences Advisory published by Advanced Sciences Research and Development Corporation Inc., PO Box 109, Lakem ont, Georgia 30552. See patent (2,482,773). JOHNSON, HOWARD Patented a motor #4,151,431 in which the power is g enerated by magnets alone. Write to: The Permanent Magnet Research Inst itute, PO Box 199, Blacksburg, Virginia 24063. It took Johnson six yea rs of legal hassles to get this \"free\" energy motor patented. In our last correspondence with Howard Johnson, he was offering license rights. LAKHOVSKY, GEORGES His device produced an electromagnetic field which oscillated in a wide"},{"pageNumber":535,"pageContent":"528 Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries spectrum of wave-lengths. His theory regarded all l iving organisms as systems of high frequency oscillating circuits, eve ry cell being a simple oscillator vibrating at a specific frequency. Since he believed that harmo- nious dynamic equilibrium was health, disease was t he opposite, and plac- ing the inharmonious cells within the range of the multiple-wave oscilla- tor brought back the cells to equilibrium. See pate nt (2,351,055). Patent and articles available from Biagio Conti, P.O. Box 1014, Carmel, NY 10512. MOORE, ARLINGTON M. Listed are just a few of the 250 automotive patents . Some of his carbure- tion designs improved engine performance, gained mo re mileage and vir- tually eliminated carbon monoxide pollution. If you can get a copy, read The Works of George Arlington Moore published by th e Madison Com- pany. Seventeen patents of interest can be found be tween (1,633,791) and (2,123,485). MORAY, T. H. Moray wrote a book titled The Sea of Energy in Whic h the Earth Floats which is available from COSRAY, The Research Instit ute, Inc., 2505 South Fourth East, Salt Lake City, Utah 84115. He w as reported to demonstrate as early as 1939 that this \"Sea of Ener gy\" can be harnessed. Once operating, his Radiant Energy Device would del iver an output of up to 50 Kilowatts of power with no other input source . See patent (2,460,707). POGUE, CHARLES N. Patent #2,026,798 design was used on a 1935 Ford V8 which resulted in 26.2 miles on one pint of gasoline, or in other wor ds about 200 miles per gallon. For more information on this and other high mileage carburetors see Secrets of the 200 MPG Carburetor by Roadrunner Publications. See patents (1,938,497) (1,997,497) (2,026,798). PUHARICH, H. K. From what I have read about Puharich, he was a doct or who gave up his practice to study closely the works of Tesla and ot her suppressed inven- tors. Several of his patents are listed in this boo k. If you study his patents you will see ideas incorporated from Tesla. Also au thor of several books on psychic research. See patents (2,995,633) (3,156 ,787) (3,170,993) (3,267,931) (3,497,637) (3,563,246) (3,586,791) (3, 629,521) (3,726,762)."},{"pageNumber":536,"pageContent":"Alternative Energy Patents 529 TESLA, NIKOLA Registering almost a hundred patents, he is the inv entor of the Tesla Coil, the poly-phase alternating current system of power generation, basic develops in high voltage, electric motors, oscillat ors, etc. Almost every- thing that touches our lives in the twentieth centu ry has been brought out to the world by Tesla. His patents can be found bet ween (334,823) and (1,402,025). ZUBRIS, V. R. The circuit described in this patent was designed f or an electric automo- bile.
