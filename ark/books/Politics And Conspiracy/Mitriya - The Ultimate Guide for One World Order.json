The award was given to Daniel Quinn whose personal example was not in line to the theme ensuring the survival of all lives. I have attached a copy of the letter sent to Ted to protest the faulty selection. One cannot expect better habits than forty-three million chronic alcoholics right here in the USA if they continue to display the ìexamples of Jesusî making water into wine. The source which is spilling to bring this behavior among the people at large must be checked. If a father tells the son, ìSon, do not drink, do not drinkî but the father makes the wine and offers to his friends, the son will be confused. So we must understand the science of ìExample(s).î Right examples must be set to set this world in proper order, otherwise, it is like a big show and nothing else! Similarly, to award a person who is chewing on the flesh of a murdered animal is not helping to pass the proper understanding for the ultimate peace and harmony for all life. It is simply a bogus show to award a nonfitting person who is 100% part of the absolute destructive force on our planet earth. It took me almost a year to write my manuscript, ìTHE ULTIMATE GUIDE TO END THIS WORLD IN A POSITIVE WAY,î for Turner Tomorrow Award.

This book contains the perfect examples for the entire human race to arrive to the final conclusion after all the sufferings, mental anguish etc. This book has the absolute answers to remove all the guesswork as found in the confused state of mind of todayís man who is fighting ìtooth and nailî to prove superiority of their Sects. They are working very hard to impose their ignorant ideology on one group over another group without any kind of CONSISTENT UNDERSTANDING OF THE ABSOLUTE TRUTH.

Special Attention to: Mr. Ted Turner Turner Broadcasting Box 105366 Atlanta, Ga 30348 SUBJECT: YOUR REF. ìBIBLE LAW OBSOLETEî WANTS SOMEBODY TO COME UP WITH A POSITIVE WAY FOR THE WORLD TO END. Dear Ted: With His arrangement, I am giving to you the ìActual Keyî to unlock the doors of ìREAL-DARKNESSî which is being manufactured constantly and multiplying very fast in the factory of limited and confused brains because of misdirections. They have been trained to subdue our immediate planet earth under various schemes. Therefore, with the awareness of the ëdark- sideí, I have provided simultaneously ëSolutionsí, ìTHE ULTIMATE SOLUTIONS,î in my enclosed manuscript to walk you through with a bright torchlight to remove the ìSPILL OF THE DARKNESS,î controlling our planet. It is definitely by Godís arrangement that he planted a ëThought-Seedí in your mind, ìWhy so much sufferings?î This itself is the first quest in oneís life to seek for the positive answers for setting the world in order and for a devotee this quest is not for the ìselfî but for all the souls struggling in this world. So this book is being created in respond to a devoteeís desire, seeking for the real answers to end this world in a positive way. The enclosed manuscript will"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Hrsikes Das Mitriya xiv fill the missing pieces of the puzzle. Once this is given a shape of a book to reach to millions will, itself, create right actions to solve the mystery of the long awaited puzzle, directing the world society at large. THIS IS IT! Before anyone proceeding into the very first page of the ëUltimate Guide to End This World Into a Positive Wayí , it must be understood, clear like a crystal, that neophyte is rigid in his beliefs and would continue to remain in that state of mind and once he has examined thoroughly this book with an open mind, courage and without any preconceived ideas and beliefs will help him to bring the consistency for higher values. This book will prove that majority of humans are being programmed by confused teachings which are suicidal for the evolution of right conscious. Therefore, the question for the growth of higher consciousness does not arise unless the perfect, the most consistent by any human logic, science of the understanding is disseminated to all. This book will open the doors for millions seeking the ultimate truth and will remove the confusions by those who kept various groups under their control through the jumble of jugglery words without any head or tail. This book will certainly identify for the seers of truth that there is a 180- degree difference between the Absolute Truth and the dogmas of their faiths/beliefs/and various confused religious sects. In order to reach to perfect answers, one must start from perfections and not from imperfections. It will lead to nowhere if one starts from imperfections and because of holding on to imperfect teachings rigidly, the human society at large is in a mood of hate and war, no peace within. The humansí emotions on death and other sufferings are realities but not some kind of conceived ideas and many faiths have monopolized their religious foundations on the humansí sufferings without teaching the basic concepts of the science of the Self-Realization for higher consciousness to lower their pains and sufferings. The humansí sufferings have been the biggest plot for worldís cheaters to lord over the minds of ìSufferersî to persuade and motivate them in their style and naturally it is possible in the absence of the Absolute True"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"The Ultimate Guide for One World Order xv Knowledge. ìWORLD OF CHEATERS AND BE CHEATED!î Under the absence of perfect answers, this book will be the utmost guide to bring forth the Absolute Truth and eventuality to connect soul from soul (light candle from candle) for the pure universal love. Their leaders, imposing different beliefs to their sectarian groups in the names of the worldís top religions, have continued to use psychological tools (war-games) to induce their members for the lust of money, position, power and all sorts of vices to benefit themselves. The fact is that most souls, out of desperation, due to many anxieties and miseries are in search of the right ìsolutionsî but they have been trapped by many ìCheatersî who have manufactured their own kind of ìtheologyî to uproot the entire worldís system in an aimless pursuit of ìfalse-prestige,î ìegoî. Yet, souls are not satisfied and consequently not happy, so due to lack of happiness, they join hands for some sort of satisfactions of various lusts derived from senses, and use different platforms to revenge from each other sect. The Head Master of the sect continues to lead them for many multiple vices and this way the group has joined hands in performing many negative activities. These kinds are lost to themselves in unbeneficial, horrible works, simply meant to destroy the world. The state of being happy is snatched away and transformed into demoniac breeding to get some sort of satisfaction which eventually results into dissatisfaction and more destruction. They become more and more absorbed into various demoniac activities such as: ìconceit,î ìarrogance,î ìhate,î ìanger,î ìfalse-prestige,î ìego,î thus illusioned, are sworn to unclean work and eventually lead into destruction over and over again. This book is going to give the pure understanding to stop the cycle of destruction over and over again. They are constantly attracted by the impermanent in the absence of the pure science and continue to teach to their sects that this material world is to enjoy to the fullest limit without any miss and because of these artificial teachings, they are always engaged in inventing something for sense-gratifications. When the senses are running like the horses on a wild goose chase, how"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Hrsikes Das Mitriya xvi can that person be called the human? He is leading a lower form of life in human dress. Bhagavad Gita states: Taking shelter of insatiable lust, pride and false prestige and being thus illusioned, the demoniac is always sworn to unclean work, attracted by the impermanent. Their belief is that to gratify the senses until the end of life is the prime necessity of human civilization. Thus, there is no measurement for their anxiety. Being bound by hundreds and thousands of desires, by lust and anger, they secure money by inappropriate means for sense gratifications. Thus, perplexed by various anxieties and bound by a network of illusions, one becomes too strongly attached to sense enjoyment and falls down into hellish conditions of life.î These words are well spoken by the Almighty Himself. Right in front of our eyes, we are seeing the results every day from house to house and outside which are the symptoms cultivated due to subdued and undermined activities. These subdued and undermined activities, in the names of famous world religions, are aggressively pursued in recent years by their Head Masters due to advance technology and thereby destroying the real Science for the understanding of Self-Realization. Their aims are to bring the world into their subjection in a ëmilitant styleí and destroying the absolute human values and that is the single most reason to bring forth continuously dictators, hateful war mongers, puffed-up people, ready to bust open at any time. They are constantly shouting the same sentence in front of their members and on T.V. in dictatorial manners to bring them into their subjections and yet not able to pass the real message of the pure love and higher consciousness even after having billions of dollars worth of expenditures. Their biggest satisfaction is: ìhow many did they enroll?î and ìhow much did they collect?î Sooner and later their members are exposed to all their shows and tricks and this way they are further frustrated in the absence of the real science and they find everything ìvoidî. Without happiness and satisfaction, they are ready to march into wrong direction and this way they have become more and more violent,"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"The Ultimate Guide for One World Order xvii cruel, and extremely vicious in their behaviors, cruel to animals and cruel to human beings. Due to the false teaching, they have no satiation for the lust. This way, they will go on increasing and increasing their insatiable desires for material enjoyments because they are, trained to be, always full of anxieties on account of accepting nonpermanent things (illusion) as permanent. They are responsible for the suffering of billions of souls and are also the causes of large population explosion and unwanted progenies throughout this globe which they blame on others. THEY NEVER LET THE LID OF KNOWLEDGE TO BE UNCOVERED FROM THE ìJAR OF JEWELSî AND ARE EXTREMELY LOUD IN THEIR BEHAVIORS TO DENOUNCE THE NATURAL LAWS (TRUE DHARM ), BINDING ALL SOULS REGARDLESS OF PLACE OF BIRTH, SIZE, COLOR OF SKIN, 4-LEGGED OR 2-LEGGED. This way they continue to march on the minds of billions of ìtrappedî innocent souls under their ëcontrol and gripí and this way these souls are misdirected and has no chance of comparison in the absence of the Absolute Science of Self- Realization as presented in my manuscript and thereby falling- down. THIS MUST BE STOPPED NOW BEFORE THEY AGAIN MAKE A MOCKERY OF THE WORLD BY GOING TO THE THIRD WORLD WAR. They write anything for their personal satisfaction and continue to prove their point of views. THE ULTIMATE TRUTH AS PRESENTED IN THIS ìMASTERPIECE OF LITERALLYî WORK NEEDS TO BE DISSEMINATED TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC AND ALSO TO OPEN CENTERS ON THE ìSCIENCE OF SELF- REALIZATIONî IN LARGE NUMBERS THROUGHOUT THIS WORLD RIGHT AWAY TO OFFSET THE NEGATIVISM, BEFORE RASCALS MAKE AGAIN THE MOCKERY OUT THIS WORLD.

The sour medicine must be digested in order to be cured and eventually the results are turned sweeter for everyone, like nice ìnectar.î If this sour medicine is not administered, the society will continue to suffer the consequences of suppressions caused by such diseases: *MURDER *RAPE *MORE COMMON WARS *LARGE POPULATION *STARVATION and many other horrible havoc, due to imperfections caused by the studies of imperfect literatures, for the soul and its consciousness. The food for the soul has been fed wrong ever since their religious foundations and, mainly, they are there for profiteering schemes. Can a mother take a bath for her own child? Can you fill your belly for someone else and considered this starved personís belly filled? The starved person must eat"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"The Ultimate Guide for One World Order xix his own to fill his own belly so he does not starve to death. Similarly, billions of souls are not able to get right food for higher consciousness since they are trapped by confused Head Masters who are shouting on podiums that someone took care of their problems and they simply come and join their membership and pay their dues. In this manuscript, one will find that the mind is perfect and it can comprehend very well between the right and wrong but the mind continues to accept the negativism for a while in the absence of pure science. This manuscript will help guide the souls into a right frame of understanding so they are not pulled in between the mind seeking for perfect answers and Head Masters who are in the mood of holding them in their bags by continuously blaring loud, senseless, distorted teachings. The mind is your best friend and the mind is the number one enemy. Through the perfect teachings as contained in this manuscript, the perfect mind will analyze and the ìselfî will flourish with love and happiness. Their hearts will be bound with pure love by the threads of the perfect understanding as presented in the manuscript. Very Important: The conditioned soulsí imperfect writings and views, caused by intuitions, are the leading cause of disturbance of minds of people in much alarming scales than ever before. This is not a quick-fix scheme of ìjumble and juggleî answers as spread by conditioned souls. This book is written for the benefit for all souls desiring inner happiness, peace within, and for this world to have permanent solution to end in a positive way as desired by you. There does not exist any positive solution for tranquility and perfect happiness unless we examine the cause for un-peace thoroughly in light of proper and perfect understanding. The solution will arise automatically and that is the key to unlock the secret which had been suppressed by wrongdoers. Ted, if you were happy with the present situation and circumstances on the planet earth, you would not be asking for the solutions to end this world into a positive way. Would you be? So who is the problem? Or what is causing the problem for the world not to yet end in a positive way with all the advance technologies,"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Hrsikes Das Mitriya xx billions of expenditures to curtail humansí sufferings etc.? This manuscript will give that clue to solve the mystery once and forever and will put the human derailed train right back on the track. In the end, this must be well understood that this ìMASTERPIECE OF LITERALLYî works could take a shape only by the arrangement of the Universal Father who is the Father and the Mother for all souls in order to come up with the creative and positive solutions to the global problems with 100 percent positive themes ensuring the ultimate survival and prosperity of all life on our planet earth. This manuscript once given a shape in the form of a book for millions of distributions throughout the world will be the final answer in order to put this world into a right track for positive motion with absolutely 180- degree changes in humansí consciousness and will wipe out the ignorance, spread by many confused Head Masters who have kept them down, away from the science of the Self-Realization and the absolute understanding. Once this perfect apocalypse is made available to millions worldwide then and only then there will be an occurrence of positive forces for happiness, tranquility, inner-peace, life of blissful and eternity. They all can be summarized into one word, i.e., THE FINAL, CLEAR- CUT, PURE DIVINE LIFE (no guess work) for coexistence and harmony to all. THIS IS IT! Finally, the Ultimate Truth which is presented will remove confusion, hypocrisy, mis-guidance, falsehood and will identify the ABSOLUTE TRUTH & REALITIES. Would you please give a shape to a book of this manuscript for the distribution to millions of souls waiting anxiously for right answers?

Sincerely, HRSIKES DAS MITRIYA"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"The Ultimate Guide for One World Order a INTRODUCTION THE ULTIMATE GUIDE FOR ONE WORLD ORDER Before I start here, it is necessary to understand ìTHE NATURE.î What is the nature? Nature is an instrument which governs all life on our planet. It is this nature that we must understand critically in order for the survival and prosperity of all life on our planet earth. For example: Feeding milk to a snake only increases its venomous poison and the one who has raised it may not, be spared from its vicious bite. This is the nature of the snake. In the same context, a cowís nature is to provide milk. When you put the seeds for tomatoes in the ground, you wonít get okras. Similarly, a human nature is supposed to be humble and, therefore, one must possess the understanding of the laws of nature in order to be classified as a human being for the perfect understanding. Unfortunately, that is where one lacks them the most. Nature is absolutely perfect and when men with the imperfect knowledge try to rape this planet earth then imperfections are set in the entire system at large. Isnít this happening throughout this globe? A manufacturer making an automobile will also provide an instruction manual to fix it, in case of future malfunctions. The manual must be complete. It cannot have missing pages. It cannot be partial. Also, it cannot be counterfeit. If it is, then the automobile cannot be fixed properly. The nature is directly under the control of the Almighty. Who is the Almighty? From one of the Vedic texts ó ìSRI ISOPANISAD î : The completeness of the whole (GOD) is stated in the following verse:"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Hrsikes Das Mitriya b OM PURAN ADAH PURAM IDAM PURNAT PURNAM UDACYATE PURANSYA PURNAM ADAYA PURNAM EVAVASISYATE The translation of this Sanskrit verse is: THE PERSONALITY OF GODHEAD IS PERFECT AND COMPLETE, AND BECAUSE HE IS COMPLETELY PERFECT, ALL EMANATIONS FROM HIM, SUCH AS THIS PHENOMENAL WORLD, ARE PERFECTLY EQUIPPED AS COMPLETE WHOLE. WHATEVER IS PRODUCED OF THE COMPLETE WHOLE IS ALSO COMPLETE IN ITSELF BECAUSE HE IS THE COMPLETE WHOLE, EVEN THOUGH SO MANY COMPLETE UNITS EMANATE FROM HIM, HE REMAINS THE COMPLETE WHOLE. AS EXPLAINED IN BHAGVAD GITA (A BRIEF SUMMARY OF VEDAS ) GOD KRISHN IS INFINITE. HE IS OMNIPRESENT AND THEREFORE OMNIPRESENT GOD CAN BE PRESENT AT A TRILLION PLACES AND STILL BE FAR AWAY, GOD CREATED US (TRILLIONS OF SOULS). SO WE ARE PART AND PARCEL OF THE COMPLETE WHOLE. GOD IS ABSOLUTELY PERFECT. FROM PERFECT GOD, IMPERFECTIONS CANNOT ARISE. ONLY FROM IMPERFECT TEACHINGS, CONTAINED IN SEVERAL, THE SO-CALLED, ìHOLY BOOKSî, IMPERFECT CONDITIONS CAN PREVAIL. THAT IS WHY MR. TED TURNER WANTS SOMEONE TO COME UP WITH A SOLUTION TO END THIS WORLD IN A POSITIVE WAY. IN THE BEGINNING OF CREATION, THE ALMIGHTY, ALSO GAVE US A LIVING MANUAL WHICH IS COMPILED IN SEVERAL BOOKS CALLED ë VEDAS í , THE WORLDíS OLDEST TEXTS. THE FACT IS THAT DUE TO THE INFLUENCE OF WRONG MANUALS, IN THE FORM"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"The Ultimate Guide for One World Order c OF FAKE HOLY BOOKS, THE PRESENT HUMAN SOCIETY IS FACING THE TERRIBLE DISASTER IN HUMANSí VALUES.

YOU WILL WASTE ANOTHER 2000 MORE YEARS IN FIXING THE WORLD. Therefore, it is very essential to know the present need of human society. The time has changed since the period of stone age, when people were killing other humans for food. The world has made rapid advancement in the technical and scientific fields. The progress in the fields of material-comfort, education, and economical development also has given rise to the large number of radio-stations, televisions, and other news-media. Whenever, a society progresses on the basis of strict material system, it will always have the tendency to - (1) Cheat, (2) Hoard, (3) Fulfill the ego over others, and furthermore it is associated with HARSHNESS, ARROGANCE, EGOISM, AND FALSE PRESTIGE. Due to cheating propensities, a great confusion is being created among many. Whatever is relayed through mass-propagating system, becomes ìTHE ULTIMATE TRUTH.î In the absence of the pure knowledge, the whole society falls into the darkness of ignorance and consequently the fall of the empire. EXAMPLES : Everyone is trying to advertise selling the real ghee (a clarified- butter). Everyone is saying, ìYes, yes, my butter is the purest, come and buy my butter; the best deal in the town.î How do you determine its purity? Because the grandfather bought it from the salesmanís father! There has to be the perfect comparison to test the authenticity of pure ghee. How one can make the distinction between the pure clarified butter (ghee) and artificial? Naturally, one cannot judge the credibility of a seller just because several friends and relatives have bought the product which may not be pure at all. Purity of ìreal gheeî can"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Hrsikes Das Mitriya d be easily determined by the taste of oneís tongue and everyone is provided with a tongue by laws of nature to determine whether the food is sweet or sour, pure or contaminated? Similarly, nature has provided every one of us with an intelligence through mind to understand things in proper perspective without being biassed or influenced by personal, past emotional links etc. EVENTUALLY, IT IS YOU, AS AN INDIVIDUAL, WHOSE LIFE IS GETTING HURT. ALSO IT IS A MISCONCEPTION BY MANY PEOPLE THAT THEY ARE AUTOMATICALLY BENEFITED AS LONG AS THEY HAVE ALIGNED WITH LARGER GROUPS, TRYING TO PASS THEMSELVES AS SPIRITUAL SOCIETIES. THEIR ACTIVITIES ARE INCONSISTENT TO THE LAWS OF NATURE. THIS KIND OF CONCEPTION HAS BEEN VERY WELL ACCEPTED BY MANY RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS: ì How many did we enroll?î Though with all kinds of material comforts throughout the world there is still a serious pinprick somewhere in the social system at large. After two world wars, the whole world formed a society of united countries federation called UNO in order to bring peace but due to a pinprick in the social body at large, there are large quarrels on issues which are insignificant. Everybody is trying to sell his ideology. ìIf you join me, you get many material benefits, and if you come in this group, you will get this happiness, so on so forth.î Ultimately, one becomes the sufferer in the hands of those who had sold you artificial ghee and thereby cause the sickness, and all other miseries. The information furnished here will help in finding the ìMISSING- CLUE OR MISSING PIECES OF PUZZLEî which will help in rebuilding friendship, peace, and prosperity with common cause. All these scientific and medical achievements are done with great labor, at the cost of many great people who have worked day and night in laboratories in order to bring the comforts of present day and subsequently missing the real peace could be achieved for all if the pure knowledge is given to souls. The main reason of comfort is to be peaceful and happy. Anyone,"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"The Ultimate Guide for One World Order e can realize that all the comforts shall become null and void if once more, the human species get involved into another world war and the odd is in favor of us unless we make some drastic changes in the understanding of ìTHE SELFî and the laws of nature, which govern all of us. This Book has been written without any prejudice or any biased opinion. The sole purpose of this Book is to bring out the ìULTIMATE TRUTHî by highlighting manís commonsense and through its process manís own consciousness will bring nothing but peace, if properly swallowed this sour medicine in some instances. Naturally, there is no help to those who still like to be attached to old-torn- up-shoes which shall continue to pinch them due to thorns and sharp pointed gravels during their journeys. In my explanation and comparisons, it should be noted that the PURE KNOWLEDGE & THE ABSOLUTE TRUTH shall bring harmony, peace and prosperity. The ideology presented here is a symbol of manís unity and will eventually create real love and ultimate peace among each others. They will then recognize only one caste of humans, and one religion namely HUMAN- RELIGION and its teachings are for all sentient beings. The information contained in this Book shall bring human society, which will no longer be bound by geographical limits, to a particular country or community, much closer to spiritual brotherhood and self realization and nature. It is a fact that manís evil and wrong actions arise from ignorance. Great Socrates said, ìknow thyself and the unexamined life is not worth living.î This Book is dedicated to all who are the true seekers of truth, peace, and prosperity. This timeless wisdom is the ultimate goal of every life, eventually. Every commercial advertisement wants to prove that it is offering the best ìbuysî in the entire town. This is quite natural perhaps with those who do not, and perhaps cannot, see below the surface. The learned and the wise who view things impartially and whose hearts and minds are not tarnished, would weigh things for themselves before acknowledging the real worth. They know too well that all that"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Hrsikes Das Mitriya f glitters is not gold, the peddler who shouts more may not necessarily be purveying genuine articles. By slowly digesting this valuable information through a proper system, people in general will have thorough understanding between ìTHE TRUTH,î partial truth, or falsehood in the age of confusion, hypocrisy and mis-guidance. The basis of this Book is to identify the realities. It is ignorance which allows the mis-guidance to be spread among people. This way people are kept more and more in ignorance and, therefore, cause their downfall. Just like an automobile in case of a breakdown, similarly, the solution was always there but it had been hidden due to forceful tactics of ëMight is Rightí type teachings throughout this world. Consequently, the results are in from of our eyes. (1) Child Abuse, (2) Drug Abuse, (3) Rape and Murder, (4) High Divorce Rate (Kidnaping of each otherís wives through court, legal battles thereby causing of unwanted, unlimited progenies and suffering of children), (5) Large increases in ëCancer and AIDS, (6) Hate and Violence and many more criminal effects, (7) Over population. So, if one does not understand the laws of nature and continue to teach against the consistency of nature, nature slaps them back and the destruction of the society(ies) then sets in. Before men create wars to solve these miseries, consequently these miseries have multiplied a million folds since World War II. If someone thinks that by simply giving a solution, automatically things can change, it will be considered foolish. The fact is that a seed put into the ground had a ëfertilization periodí to grow into a plant and then a tree and finally into a ìfruit bearing tree.î Before starting to plant a tree, one must clean weeds and dig a hole to put seed and fertilizer and later with water. It must be a continuous process of up keeping. If"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"The Ultimate Guide for One World Order g properly nourished with fertilizer and water the tree will turn into a plant and eventually a ìfruit bearingî tree. Water and fertilizer must be given continuously, otherwise the tree will have neither shade nor fruits or may not even grow into a tree. Similarly in the absence of the ìREAL KNOWLEDGE,î the human minds have turned into vicious snakes and they are in the rampage for self-destruction(s). They are helpful in neither giving a nice shade nor bearing good fruits like a good tree. This Book is written with an understanding that we all want peace on our planet and some of us want to find the way to get out from this cycle of birth and death to go to the ìReal Homeî (with God). Nobody wants to go to hell planets - unfortunately the hellish conditions are getting more and more prevalent all over the globe even including the USA, where today 35 million people are under poverty, 10 million children are being abused physically and even sexually and in many instances by their own parents (Incests), many children are born out of wedlock. There are more than one million homosexuals in the State of Texas alone, and they are very proud to be called homosexuals. Here in the USA, it has gone so much worse that a mother cooked a child and served to grandparents as a nice and tender steak. Churches have been around every corner of the country, yet they have failed to check further growth of these serious diseases. As a matter of fact these evils are rapidly increasing to the worst that people of higher tastes are unable to bear these pains. The missionaries influence in poor countries are now growing stronger than ever before in the last 10-years and there had been tremendous increases in wars and yet a billion population growth throughout the globe. THE QUESTION ARISES, WHAT IS THE MISSING LINK? THEN, WHAT MUST BE DONE RIGHT AWAY TO CURTAIL? These seeds of disruptions are not planted recently but these have multiplied over a period of 2,900 years since the establishment of the Old Testament. Slowly, evil teachings have closed-in, the entire planet. It is the Old Testament which gave rise to Islam, 1400 years ago.

They are worse than ever before the formation of UNO. So let us look into what can be done to really solve these above bad situations with an open mind and courage to improve, without any prejudices and hate - 1) When a child is born in India, does he come on our planet earth from a different system than a child born in America? 2) When one throws a coin up in the air, does it fly up or comes down in America? Similarly, it sure comes down in other countries which are labeled poor nations by American system. 3) When the Sun shines each one of us feels the energy of the Sun in the form of heat and light. One may claim to be a native of an advanced country in comparison to a poor country, still all of these people born from one side of the fence to the other side of the fence feel the heat and light of the Sun. The Sun is not going to say, ìI am simply giving heat in America or everybody feels my heat and light according to their beliefs. Or I will be more shining on the rooftops of those who have more dices (money).î Whatever may be oneís beliefs regarding the Sun, the fact is that Sun gives light and heat to all the living entities regardless of his/her country"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"The Ultimate Guide for One World Order i of origin, color of body, language spoken, and/or whatever may be oneís fantasy. The eternal truth remains the same for all of us. 4) Eating, mating, sleeping and defending whether in American body, Christian body, German body, Muslim body, or four legged body are the same. Maybe it is the difference in the degree of sophistication ñ like a rich man may have more opulence than other humans to enjoy sense-gratification. Yet the beggar on the street, who is hungry, relish the taste of food without having any material opulence. The food will not become tastier than what it tastes because of rich manís millions of dollars in a safe locker. Even dogs and pigs enjoy their food and if one tries to snatch away food from a dog, the dog, immediately, starts growling. A dog becomes extremely angry because he does not want to be disturbed while he is enjoying eating his food but we humans must understand beyond these topics of simply eating, mating, sleeping, and defending. 5) When a carpenter makes chair, desk, table, closet, building, has he designed them with the intention someone destroying them? If someone enters into his shop and starts breaking everything the carpenter has created, I am sure he will call the police and get him arrested for damaging his various creations in the art of carpentry. Similarly, God has created many lives. Regardless of oneís beliefs, they are there and one canít refuse their existence. The people who are willing to change and make this world a better place to live as well as to know the top secret of the Almighty, may encounter here some sour tastes due to their bringing up.

Well this is what exactly taking place in this present day society in the absence of the right knowledge and the proper understanding. Today, with all the advancement of medical science, the cancer rate has grown tremendously in the last several years. WHY? This could happen in the absence of the real knowledge. Christian missionaries are backed up with billions of dollars, yet the problems are multiplying very fast. Islamic mullahs are doing similar activities backed by petro-dollars, yet they have no peace in the Middle-East. They are constant at war, unhappy and dissatisfied. There are many questions that we must ask ourselves (soul-searching) for the benefit of our children, worldís children and specially for the stability of humans on this small planet earth. Recently, many black Americans have converted from Christianity to Islam as their way of life. It is absolutely falling from one pitfall to another pitfall, like joining two opposite gangs on the street. When it comes to advancement of spiritual life, we have to give up hate from one another. It is a complete process for the understanding of the ìABSOLUTE TRUTHî based on Vedas, otherwise the downfall of soul is 100% certain into the pitfall of wars, hates, arrogance and many undesirable sufferings. LET US ANALYZE: 1) Tax payersí millions of dollars are spent each year to pay the salaries/expenses of Police enforcement to stop the alcohol usage while driving. United States Federal government is also funding States of Union to stop wide spread of alcohol while driving, intoxicated. These accidents have resulted into more than 25,000 deaths yearly and billions of dollars in medical bills and property damages. It has been proven many time by various government agencies that major accidents are caused by intoxicated drivers. Is it not contradictory to"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"The Ultimate Guide for One World Order k the U.S. Enforcement Laws, when many people have formed the habits of chronic alcoholism by being offered wine as the ëblood of Jesusí right from the very infancy? The psychology of an individual is developed in his first seven years of oneís life. Today, small quantities and tomorrow larger dosages of wine. Vedas speak very firmly against any kind of intoxication and once there is control over oneís mind and senses then and only then one can think of attaining the Kingdom of GOD. There is absolutely thorough process for controlling the senses and mind. This will be discussed in the end for the real solution to end this in a positive way. From generations, many people have been made to believe that each word of the Bible was literally the word of God. Before the church used to control the Bible and the priest read from the Bible passages suitable for his congregation and each time, he (priest) emphasized the authenticity of the Bible and repeating the same sentence ìEACH WORD CONTAINED IN THE BIBLE IS A WORD OF GOD.î So this sticky information was passed down from father to son under their subconscious minds and this way they lived under these strict principles. Around the turn of the 19 th century people became more literate and they did not require the assistance of the priests/pastors. Literacy to read and write increased many fold and therefore the controlled system got loosen-up. It became a competitive business to increase the sale of the Bible and results started turning sour by applying each word literally as the word of God. Churches lost the control on the actual activity of people in goodness. The quality was lost. Though the church might say that they have larger enrollment of members than ever before but this is all what they got, nothing else as far as quality and morals of people are concerned. They are absolutely finished."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Hrsikes Das Mitriya l EXAMPLE FROM THE BIBLE WHICH IS BEING USED LITERALLY AS THE WORD OF GOD Chapter John 2, 1-12 : ìNow is the third day a marriage feast took place in Caína of Galíi-lee and the mother of Jesus was there. Jesus and his disciples were also invited to the marriage Feast. When the wine ran short the mother of Jesus said to him: ìThey have more wine.î But Jesus said to her: ìWhat Have I to do with you, woman.?î My hour has not yet come. His mother said to those ministering, ìWhatever he tells you, do.î As it was, there were six stone water jars sitting there as required by the purification rules of the Jews, each able to hold two or three liquid measures. Jesus said to them: ìFill the water jars with water.î And they filled them to the brim. And he said to them: ìDraw some out now and take it to the director of the feast.î So they took it. When, now the director of the feast tasted the water that had been turned into wine but did not know what its source was, although those ministering who had drawn out the water knew, the director of the feast hailed the bridegroom and said to him: ìEvery other man puts out the fine wine first, and when people are intoxicated, the inferior. You should have reserved the fine wine until now.î Jesus performed this in Caína of Galíl-lee as (the) beginning of the signs, and he made his glory manifest, and his disciples put their faith in him. If this is what creates a faith, or the foundation of a religion: I know so that such types are working absolutely against U.S. Laws. One side, we are spending millions of dollars to stop alcohol usage while driving and on the other hand we are creating a society by slowly developing a taste of wine right from infancy in the Sundayís mass under the guidance of the Holy Bible. Such religious beliefs are actually molding the ideas of innocent in the development of chorionic alcoholics. Let us not be blind!

This is OK! Again here is a serious contradiction that right after these cities were ruined, God Jehovah approves the incest for his friend Lot whom the angles were sent down to protect as Lot practices incest with his daughters in the cave (Gen 19:32). ìAnd both the daughters of Lot became pregnant by their father. In time the firstborn became mother to a son and called his name Moíab. He is the father of Moíab to this day. As for the younger she too gave birth to a son and then called his name Benamíml.

Throughout their lives these children go through emotional set back. Vedic texts are explicit, ìWhy sex must be controlled and must be limited between parents for begetting children?î One does not have a big loss for not having illicit sex if he/she was trained through a Vedic process right from the young age. There are thousands of moral stories, from Vedic texts, which are read to the children and Vedas emphasize that their actual training starts when they are in their mothersí womb. So parents must be cultured to bring cultured kids. The Bible followers encourage their Kids to go for dancing with opposite sex right from very young age.

How many innocent animals have been murdered under the commandment of Lord Jehovah of the Bible for putting blood sign on the two doorposts and on the lintel of the houses just to identify Egyptians from Jews? Is it not an animal cruelty? Now if you look into the Bhagvad Gita , you wonít find a single word which approves such horrible acts. If Animal Cruelty or Humane Society of America comes to know about someone doing such criminal acts, they will find this person and put him in jail. Jesus spoke to his disciple in the Chapter of 1 Corinthian of the Bible, 10:25-26: ìEverything that is sold in a meat market keep eating, making no inquiry on account of your conscience; for to Jehovah belong the earth that fills it.î As discussed earlier, one kind of killing leads into other kind of killings. Consequently, these contradictory teachings are leading us toward humanís devastation and self-destruction. Either we live in harmony to the laws of nature which we are all part and parcel of the same nature regardless of bodily complexions, a country of birth, or to suffer its reaction by having unwanted progenies, wars, etc. September 5, 1988, Newsweek magazine had published an insert regarding, ìWhere Veal comes from?î: ìVeal comes by murdering baby cow within 7-10 days.

Antibiotics in veal (baby-cow) and other farm animals create virulent strains of bacteria that wreak havoc on human health. Salmonella poisoning is reaching epidemic proportions. To keep calves alive under such torturous conditions, they are continually given drugs which can be passed on to humans.î The Popeís favorite meals have been Veal-pappajan. And the world looks at them as embodiment of God. God is very compassionate according to the Vedic texts. Such above horrible acts of violence on lesser intelligent brothers of ours is not at all the signs of compassion. American Medical Science has proven that meat eating is the number one cause of cancer. You have a choice. Man has created his own destiny and the nature will either give him punishment or reward. Nobody interferes except he himself. The nature is controlled by the Almighty God, who is absolutely perfect and, therefore, imperfections from men cause imperfection. This is the very basic reason of inconsistency in our todayís system. The minimum daily requirement of protein, which nutritional experts calculate to be between seventy and ninety grams, is easily achieved with dairy products and foods from the vegetables. Protein is found in ample quantify in milk, cheese, yoghourt, whole wheat, corn, many varieties of nuts and beans and some vegetables. Thus, vegetables, fruits, grains, and dairy products provide a perfect balanced diet. Consuming animal flesh, on the other hand, results in excess protein, which produces liver ailments, high blood pressure and hardening of the arteries. One time, I met a lady of Christian faith, in a conference, at the Houston Community College .

The first ingenious idea that occurred to the political scholars was to create dissension among people. For this purpose, the occurrence of the world Aryas , Dasa and Dasyu in the Rigveda came handy and furnished an easy and effective instrument. They at once propounded the theory that the Dasas and Dasyus were the original inhabitants of Aryavarta (currently known as India) and the Aryan s had come from their original home somewhere outside. This itself goes against the Vedic texts. According to Vedic texts we find the definition of an Aryan : The highest civilized human with noble deeds and who have complete knowledge in the science of ëSelf-Realizationí, Vedic texts, is called the Aryan . Just like someone who studied Chemistry is called a Chemist. Similarly, those advanced in Vedic understanding were called Aryan s and it had nothing to do with the complexion of the outer cover of material 9-gates body. The Bible pushers interpreted the moral phenomenon of the struggle of the noble against the ignoble, of righteousness against wickedness, and physical phenomenons of an elemental struggle in the atmosphere as the wars of the Aryana against the Dasas and Dasyus whom they held to be the aborigines of black skin, flat nose and hostile or harsh speech.

He came to India in 1834 as the legal adviser to the Council of India. Here he became the Chairman of the Education Board, and stayed here for four years. During that period, he visited various parts of the country and found that the way in which the East India Company was running the Government, it was not possible to convert the Vedic followers (currently known as Hindus) to the Christian religion. The first thing, therefore, he did, was to recommend the stoppage of grants to the institutions where Sanskrit was taught. On reaching England in 1839, he explained that study and teaching of Sanskrit was stopped because if Sanskrit teaching had been allowed to continue, the propagation of the Bible among the Hindus and bringing them into the fold of Christianity would have been almost impossible. He knew that Sanskrit was the key to the Aryan religion and its scriptures. By putting an end to the learning of Sanskrit and promoting the compulsory teaching of the Bible through State-controlled schools and universities, he visualized that the Vedic followers, particularly the aristocratic Hindu families of Bengal, would voluntarily embrace Christianity without any effort on the part of the Government or the Church."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"The Ultimate Guide for One World Order 7 MACAULAYíS LETTER TO HIS FATHER (CALCUTTA, INDIA, OCTOBER 12, 1836): My dear Father, Our English schools are flourishing wonderfully.

At that time, MaCaulay was 55 years old and Max Muller was a young man of 32. They had a discussion for a long time in which MaCaulay told Max Muller that East India Company was prepared to spend a lac of rupees (in those days one dollar equivalent to one rupee) if he could translate the Rigveda in a manner which would destroy the belief of the Hindus in the Vedic religion. He assured him that in creating disrespect in the hearts of the Hindus for the Vedas , his cooperation would be highly welcome to the British Government. It would strengthen the foundations of the empire by asking the Christianized Hindus the loyal and faithful allies of their rulers. To achieve this object, Max Muller was at first appointed as the Head of the Vedic Research Department in the Oxford University. During his tenure of service, from 1855 to 1900, he carried out the so-called Vedic research under the name of Oriental Studies. The unsuspecting God conscious people of India, ignorant of the deep game of these missionaries, thought that Max Muller was rendering a great service to India by promoting the Vedic research.

These Brahmin students, who returned home after completing their studies from Oxford, were appointed as Lecturers in Indiaís colleges. As they were well indoctrinated in the theories of the Bible-based education, they proved to be unintentional but potent instruments in propagating those half-assimilated theories among their pupils. As the scheme of studies in Indiaís educational institutions was the same that in Oxford, the result was that the students in India who received education in these institutions, and who were totally devoid of the knowledge of the Vedas, became conversant with those theories, and under their influence became indifferent, if not altogether hostile, to pure knowledge of God as stated in Vedic texts.

Ultimately, the English, the Bible stickers, being more cunning in their behaviors, succeeded in establishing their empire by deceit, cunning, forgery and the policy of divide and rule and by subtly undermining the culture of the people. The first seed of disintegration was sown by creating the idea that Aryans were not the original inhabitants of Bharat (India), and that they had come from somewhere outside, about which none of them was certain and everybody propounded a conjectural and conflicting theory. All new guess works were created, printed, and were forced in colleges to be studied. From there, many new Indian brains were created who also published their own theories and versions. The distorted theories are still floating throughout India, even today.

Muslim follow the Koran which instructs them to kill infidels (non- Muslims) or force them to convert by all means to become one of them. Those who are converted do the same Koranic Jihad to others.

In his remarkable career that covered 60 years, he wrote more than 50 plays ñ some of his most famous plays: ìThe Devilís Disciple ,î ìMan and Superman ,î and his last play ìDon Juan in Hellí. Due to the influence of the Bible and the Koran, the whole world is in a great confusion and hellish conditions. Bernard Shaw believed that animals had life and were not meant to be killed for human consumption. Superficially, English Dictionary, in the last 140 years, has divided the human diet into two kinds, i.e., ìvegetarianî and ìnon-vegetarianî and thereby adding further confusion due to ignorance in the knowledge of the ìSELF.î Earlier, I had explained the diet for human and for meat-eating animals. So by nature humans are supposed to subsist on human diet since cats, dogs, foxes, vultures, live on the dead carcass, do not violate the laws of nature by eating flesh.

MAHATMA GANDHI SAID: ìTHE GREATNESS OF A NATION AND ITS PROGRESS CAN BE MEASURED BY THE WAY ITS ANIMALS ARE TREATED.î The action is the determination of next life. What one has done, it will come back to him/her million-times stronger. It is the law of nature. If man can manufacture a computer to keep a tab on humanís activities, then how can one think of fooling THE FATHER who has created the entire universe(s) and lives in them? Just like humans are eating the dead bodies of the murdered animals under the influence of the Holy Bible and the Koran, similarly, at the time of death the very same people will be going through the similar slaughter to be served as nice and tender beef to their fellow brothers and sisters in human bodies. Do you find a police officer catching hold of those who are innocents? He is always looking for criminals. There must be certain codes of conduct identifying between criminals and civilized humans. Similarly, the Vedic texts teach humans to refrain from flesh eating in their multiple verses which will be explained in later Chapters. It is your life and it is time not to be cheated out, anymore. There are several cheaters who want to cheat you unless you want to be cheated. ARTHUR SCHOPENHAUER, a well-known German philosopher wrote, ìThis goes to confirm the popular belief that the Vedas are eternal and not answerable to any human agency and that they emanated from God Himself.î Knowing this very fact that the Vedas are eternal and not answerable to any human, Jesus went to Bharat (presently known as India, was also called Aryavarta ) at Jagatnath, Puri, India.

Jesus returning back did not help to uplift the morals of these uprooted people and so he tried to compromise by making water into wine and by multiplying fish for hungry people to manifest his strength as being a messiah or savior for the people of Palestine. Unfortunately, he could not see through that he was trying to play a nice musical flute in front of water-buffalo. What would the buffalo do? Kick! After realizing, he tried to compromise to please these people involved into various low material sense-gratifications. Just like Hitler used Swastika in reverse order. ëSwastikaí word comes from Sanskrit which is summed up to mean: ìauspicious,î ìprosperityî and ìhappiness.î But it was used by Nazis, in reverse to bring the forces to annihilate evil forces prevailing Germany so there could be peace and prosperity for all souls. Over a period of time some Bible followers have started drinking grape juice. They must not forget that the Bible boast very much of Jesusí making water into fine wine as one of the great miracles of Jesus. In other words, it is O.K. Everything is O. K. Then what is the need of the Vedas ? What is the need of ëScience of Realizationí? If everything is O. K., then we do not need police officers to arrest drunk drivers. Wine causes man to lose his control and this kind of drug to be manufactured by anyone is not going to cultivate a society of non-drunkards and specially such examples set by the ëSon of Godí, and accepted by ignorants.

Although it has been mentioned in the matter of linguistics that Sanskrit is the Indo- European language but the Bible thumpers have caused serious confusion in the minds of the world society about Sanskrit being the only source of Indo-European languages. These situations are arising because they are in the mood of fulfilling their ego, proving their false prestige. Constantly trying to prove that they are better than others. They do not believe in the real source. Their entire lives are wasted in proving the right things wrong or confusing THE ULTIMATE TRUTH. They are just out there to satisfy their personal emotions.

For instance, The World Book of Encyclopedia writes about Hinduism as a mythology. This itself is the greatest joke of the century. The fact is that we all living entities are going through Birth, Disease, Old Age, and Material Death and nothing has changed since time immemorial. Nobody can claim that because of the new computer science, advance technology, new medical research, the nature has changed its course about human or animal birth, disease, old age and death. As a matter of fact, these sufferings have been intensified beyond oneís control. God Krishn explains to His dear friend Arjun : ìWhy these sufferings?î The puffed- up egoistic Bible thumpers have listed Bhagavad Gita as a mythology and thereby cutting the brain of true knowledge from this worldís society. According to the dictionary meaning, mythology means: something not really true, like legend . But Bhagavad Gita , a brief summary of the Vedas states very clearly as stated by God Krishn, ìTo every Action Done by the Self Shall Have Definite Reaction.î This law of nature was explained in all Vedic texts since time immemorial. Sir Isaac Newton had explained this material law just about 300 years ago in his finding of ë Gravitational Lawsí of physics, but the Brahmins of Aryavart knew them very well and had sent many airplanes which could fly from one planet to another planet like the Jumbo-Airplanes fly from one town to another town in todayís time.

These weapons were so dangerous that even the unborn generations were harmed by their use. The information can be obtained from the graphic account of the Mahabarat . Desikacharís publication did not become the bestseller but it inspired the scientists to have the break through in arms- technology in the 20 th century. Charles Berlitz, the American author, who tells this information in one of his bestsellers that a copy of the booklet by Desikachar had found its way from Madras, India to the university library of Harvard in the year 1930. Robert Oppenheimer , then a student at Harvard, was amazed to find the ancient India could produce weapons of such magnitude. Oppenheimer was convinced that such weapons were possible on a theoretical basis and he began to think deeply of producing weapons like this ì Atom Bombs î which were used thousands of years ago in Bharat during Mahabharat ís times. The young American Jew took up the study of Sanskrit and very soon he became a profound scholar of Sanskrit. When he read the Bhagavad Gita , Robert Oppenheimer was convinced that the worldís first atomic war had been fought by ancient Hindus in India. ìI AM BECOME DEATH, THE DESTROYERî DECLARES GOD KRISHN IN THE ELEVENTH CHAPTER OF THE BHAGAVAD GITA (VERSE 32)."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"Hrsikes Das Mitriya 28 Robert Oppenheimer was convinced that it was the literal truth.

The test was called ìTRINITYî after the three principal manifestations of God in Vedic texts ó BRAHMA THE CREATOR, VISHNU THE SUSTAINER, AND SHIVA THE DESTROYER. (These topics will be discussed in later Chapters). This has nothing to do with a distorted idea by Christian writers about their baseless trinity of Father, Jesus (son), and Holy Ghost of the Bible.

By the fifth century an Indian had discovered the earthís axial rotation. Well before the Renaissance re- illuminated Europe, Indian mathematicians had explored the upland realms of quadratic equations and cube roots, had become the first to assign 3.1416 as the value of ë pi' , and had mastered the concept of infinity.î In the beginning of my book, I have quoted a verse from Vedic text ì Sri Isopanisad î which discuss about the infinity. So this verse had been in the books of Vedas since time immemorial. Pythagoras went to India and studied mathematics, geometry and later he became well known by the Pythagorean theorem whose principles were known earlier from Indiaís University of Taxilla . That was more than 2,512 years ago. Later this worldís biggest learning center was burned to ground by the invading Muslims. Many European writers have concluded that Vedas did not come into existence, in writing forms, only some four thousand years ago to keep up with close proximity to the Bibleís Old Testament timing. According to learned Brahmins , they were always in existence ever since the creation of our immediate universe and prior to it they were stored and memorized by the Brahminís mind pores. Even if everything burns up in raging fire including birds, animals and humans, still Vedas cannot be lost because some trusted devotees of the Lord remember the entire verses by heart and when the right time comes, they can take birth anywhere in this universe to rewrite the job of Vedic texts.

Though those notebooks ó a lost one was recently recovered ñ Ramanujan, otherwise a simple Hindu clerk, has become renowned as a genius by 1980's mathematicians.

Very soon India started having all lustful entertainments during the compulsory studies of the Bible. THERE ARE 43 MILLION CHRONIC ALCOHOLICS HERE IN AMERICA. What is saving India? Some left over Vedic culture. What is destroying USA? The Bible teachings. Recent penetration of morals studies of Vedic principles, self-control through various Yoga, Kundalini , emphasis on no meat fish or egg eating, no illicit sex, no intoxication, no gambling (from many Vedic schools in USA) have brought awareness among certain segments of the society here in India. Human life is the highest form of life among all the other species of life existing on our planet earth.

If you are so anxious to grab the planet earth, what are you having big shows in churches seeking for heaven? FOR EXAMPLE, Sanskrit IS SPOKEN IN HIGHER PLANETS.

A. , a teacher of Sanskrit, has been conducting Sanskrit training seminars throughout the United States. Mr. Houston is an American born native from New York, speaks very firmly the above statement: ì Sanskrit being the Language of the Gods.î In one of his enclosures and many worldwide advertisements for its learning, Mr. Houston has quoted many references of great people:`` Joseph Campbell called it. ìThe great spiritual language of the world.î ìI feel that Sanskrit , just by the mere virtue of doing, saying and in singing it all weekend has produced this incredible lightness of being . . .î Karen Nylander . ìI donít think Iíve ever absorbed so much so quickly,î . . .

Vyaas Houston, World Renowned Sanskrit teacher. Earlier, I had written that NASA has recognized it as the only natural language which can render ideas with the precision of current artificial language. SANSKRIT, THE SUPERIOR LANGUAGE: Sri Keshav Dev Sharma, well-known linguist from Virginia USA, writes: ìMankind is in gratitude to those who created the Sanskrit Language and refined it as one of the greatest projects undertaken. Just as, in recent history, Euler studied the human eye to create his achromatic lens and Riemann studied the human ear to create his theory of shock waves, the ìrefinersîof Sanskrit studied the human speech apparatus and the relationship between sound and reality to create nearly a perfect vehicle of human expression. The notion popularized by modern linguists that people everywhere create languages is correct to the extent that ordinary people create ordinary and often inferior languages. It is only when the conscientious intellectual leaders in a society refine and enrich the ordinary language that superiorized language can be made available to masses. Sanskrit continuous to reign supreme for the simple reason that it achieved the unsurpassed fusion of the power of human speech and the laws of nature. For the originators and refiners of Sanskrit , words were not merely the poetís tools or the magic keys to prosperity and heavenly bliss: speech was seen as a casual the Gods. Aksara , ìthe original unmovingî part of the flow of speech, came to denote the smallest element of speech recognized at that time, i.e., the syllable. This lead to akhkhalikrtya , ìsyllabizing,î and to the association of the power of music with the power of speech. Terms like varna (sound) or avasana , (pause) were examined. This exercise led to a fully developed science of phonetics, achieving in the process the recognition of the role of voicing and of a mouth aperture, the nasalization of vowels and"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"Hrsikes Das Mitriya 36 the nature of the stops as contact sounds, as the name sparsa (contact) shows. The new science was called ìthe studyî ( siksa ): its pure interest was in sounds rather than letters. The phonetic principles were applied to the art of writing and toward the development of a script which once and for all eliminates the discrepancies between the written word and the spoken. This script was called devanagari , ëthe city of the Godsí. The principle driving force in the development of the devanagari was the concern that the script conveys through the eyes what the mind had grasped through the ears. LIKE A SWISS WATCH: Precision is the key, the target and the ammunition, the heart and the soul of Sanskrit. Whether it is the ganapath (the collection of word-classes) or the dhatupath (the collection of ërootsí) or the sutra-path (the collection of aphorisms), Sanskrit makes the most apt and definitive use of the principle of least action and puts forth in an extremely efficient capsule form a whole world of meaning. The use of mind-boggling, highly systematized declensions with nouns, verbs, roots, etc., according to case, number, gender, tense, etc., facilitated precise communication of every complex meaning is an abbreviated form. PANINI- GRAMMARIAN/SAGE Sanskrit grammar is inextricably linked with the name of Panini. He is universally acknowledged as not only the oldest grammarian, but also the greatest. Paniniís real contribution lies in his defining of the rules of Sanskrit grammar, in standardizing them, and in stating them in writing in the form of aphorisms in one place, his Astadhyayi, ìThe Eight Chapters.î He lived, 2,600 years ago in Bharat (presently known as India), when India was one nation from Gandhar (present day Afghanistan) to Vietnam, Indonesia, Bali, Sumatra. He was born in ancient Gandhar (now Afghanistan). Paniniís Astadhyayi is composed in a concise sutra style and consists of a little less than 4,000 sutras. The first"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"The Ultimate Guide for One World Order 37 impression of the Astadhyayi would be one of organized chaos. But with effort, one can recognize how Panini structured the text after a struggle between two principles logical grouping and technical economy. Before he sat down to write the aphorisms, the complete logic of things must have settled in his mind and then he made a heroic quest for use of the principles of least action and achieved unsurpassed economy in the execution of the basic structure of the work. Panini reduced vowels to their types comprising all varieties by duration, accent, nasalization, etc. and gave scores of rules on how articulation by euphony can be made natural and uncumbersome. By discovering the proper object of grammar, Panini and grammarians from his school of thought raised Sanskrit to the level of not simply a great language but to that of a science of human speech. SANSKRIT TRAVELS TO CHINA It is now recognized that the rise of Chinese phonetical science-and creation of an almost phonetical script-in the 2, 550 years ago was the result of influence of Sanskrit. By the so- called fenchíieh principle, original word signs began to be used in Chinese to denote initial and final consonants alone (The inspirational source for charms used by Chinese Buddhists was the Vedic Sanskrit siddha script ). The Korean ommun-script , announced by royal proclamation in year 1446, used Sanskrit alphabetical order - k , kh, ng, t, th, u , ph, m.. Also, the Japanese Ahiru script followed the Sanskrit phonetic studies. The word Swastika comes from Vedic text and it has a great spiritual meaning for the Aryans, the Sanskrit word is Arya, (Humans with noble deeds and possessing higher understanding in the science of the Self-Realization). Max Muller was planted by the English to bring negativism and confusion among ignorants by distortation of the actual meaning of the word ìAryan.î This way, he damaged the concept of ìAryaî as derived from Vedas . He made it sound like a complexion/bodily"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"Hrsikes Das Mitriya 38 issue rather than spirituality behind its deep meaning and thereby increasing the puffed-up nature, more so, on the bodily concepts sowed the seeds of hate, violence, destruction and disturbance for the future generation. Vedas are like fire. What does fire do? Burns the garbage into ashes. Similarly, Vedasí teachings destroy all the negative forces and upgrade consciousness to the highest level. During British Era, they had one aim, i.e., to subdue the Vedic culture and to, artificially, create an environment that they were higher class people. They used Max Muller, a famous German Sanskrit scholar, for their dirty work. Because of the lack of consciousness, they did what was necessary to destroy the real meaning of advance culture for their pursuits, power and position. Also Christianity had been taken out of context from Vedic texts and yet the whole world has been getting farther from peaceful coexistence. Therefore, it is time for everyone to bring this world for a peaceful, happiness, amicable, coexistence once and forever. It is only possible to bring back the true teachings of Vedas , absolutely within context. We must never quote things which are not within context otherwise it is like a big fire which will gulp-down everyone into ashes in its flame. Start all over! For example, Swastika absolutely comes from Vedic Sanskrit texts, it is not a German word, or an English word. It is absolutely a word from Sanskrit language. Swastika, was used by native American, Greeks, and natives of other countries. There was but Vedic Religion in the whole world 5,129 years ago, when the great war, called Mahabharat, was fought between the Kauravas and Pandavas in which almost all the great men perished. Prior to Mahabharat war, Vedic civilization was a wonder to the world and attracted the people of the world, to come to India to learn science and art ñ Manu, II, 20. That India was the queen mother of the world, as borne out by a passage in the Maitri Upanishnt, which enumerates 17 Emperors that ruled over all the then known world. It was from ancient India that knowledge traveled westward. It went first to Egypt, thence to Greece, thence to Rome and spreading over all Europe"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"The Ultimate Guide for One World Order 39 and passed on to American continent. European Orientalists misinterpret Sanskrit books and so come to no right conclusion (void). For instance, the late Prof. Max Muller translated bradhnam by horse, whereas it means the Great Self. Dr. Goldstrucker rightly observes in his Bible in India that Aryavart (India) is the fountainhead of all knowledge, morals, science and art; and religions have spread out from this very land. He was a French man. He prays to God, O Lord, may my country (France) be as great as Aryavart. Dara Shikoh , the most learned son and heir-apparent of Emperor Shahjehan (who is identified with Indiaís Taj Mahal ) of Delhi, says in his translation of Upanishads that though he studied Arabic and other languages, yet he goes so solace but in Sanskrit. All this great progress was dashed to pieces due to ignorance (age of Kali ), like the books of chemistry or mathematics remaining on the shelves collecting dust and nobody giving a chance to interpret them. Since then the Brahmins (learned scholars of Sanskrit and the Vedas ) have given up their old auster training and ceased to teach the other classes of society. Because of the Vedic culture prevalent throughout this globe more than five thousand and five hundred years ago, so it must not be a surprise to unearth Swastikas in different parts of the world. Such confusing statements, made by many historians, that Aryans invaded India had been the most bogus discovery. This cock story was invented out of void. They donít have the foundation to substantiate the baseless theory. In the East, the Swastika remains unburdened by Nazi stigma and guilt. In the 1940's a group of Vedic scholars, embarrassed and horrified over the Naziís employment of the symbol, charged that Hitler had taken the left-facing Swastika and perverted it into the right-hand Swastika to align the Nazis with malevolent beings and forces of consuming darkness.

They remained in Europe to arise in a generation born after World War II and drifted to America to haunt the minds of those already disposed to racism. Neo-Nazi groups eventually rose and in the 80's a class of juvenile delinquents called ì skinheads, î for their near- shaven heads, have maliciously taken white supremacy as their rebelís cause. In addition, anti-Nazi fanatics have occasionally run amuck. US Vedic followers have been caught between anti- Semitics and anti-Nazis In the early 80's a Hindu woman living in New York City was innocently wearing a sari patterned with swastikas when an attacker waylaid and brutally murdered her. It was shocking and meaningless crimes, but for many Hindu s it icily drove home the fact that the Swastika in the West is a hatred symbol. No Swastika adorns the outside or inside of a Hindu temple in the US. By 1988 the Swastika sari murder had been forgotten. In a blood-donor campaign held inside the Detroit Hindu temple, a handmade Swastika on a small banner was temporarily hanging on the wall, an auspicious sign for a well-intentioned community service. That night, under cover of darkness, the temple was broken into and vandalized. Within a month ñ late November - a small temple in Troy, Michigan, was vandalized not because of a Swastika, but because the templeís outdoor sign used Hindi lettering. Apparently, the vandals mistook the Hindu for Hebrew and thought they were damaging a synagogue.

Thomas Wilson , a curator of the US National Museum, wrote a book ì The Swastika: The Earlier Known Symbol and its Migrations î in the year 1894 for the Smithsonian Institute. The work opens with a right-hand Swastika on its title page and is an exhaustive survey of the global dispersion of this symbol from the Navaho tribes of North America to Egypt, ancient Troy and the Taoists of China. Among a cadre of western writers referenced in Prof. Max Muller, the bought German Vedas í translator (Max Muller was bribed by British ), the first introduced the word Aryan to the European intelligentsia. It is through Muller that Aryan is first imbued with a sense of race rather than an attribute of virtuous, spiritual nobility. Wilson writes, ìProf. Max Muller makes the symbol different according as it arms are bent to the right or left. That bent to the right he denominates the true Swastika, that bent to the left he calls Suavastika, but he gives no authority for the statement.î Hitler had used the Vedic symbol of Swastika after his studies in Yoga.

Ravenscroftís account tells the Stein befriended a youthful Hitler in Vienna when he fortuitously bought a book that Hitler had read and scribbled margin notesí reference to Yoga and Lord Shivaís Third Eye. Hitler belonged to a lodge which had replaced Christian cross with a Swastika and practiced non-Christian and non-Semitic studies. Great Swami Prabhupada spoke that it is extremely important to have a discipleship. In other words, there must be a teacher (a learned Guru ) who is able to pass on these valuable interpretations of Vedic texts with its context from his past spiritual masters in proper line of succession. Since many people are extremely arrogant and puffed-up, they simply do not want to surrender and this way they end up creating problems to the world-society or themselves.

Meditation is in context to Karma theory and, therefore, not applicable to Christians. Their faiths on Jesus who died for their sins and, therefore, this burden of meditation does not apply according to their ìhoaxî system. From Mahabharat texts, we find that Kurus were boastful, deceitful, treacherous, womanizers, and most envious and vicious people on this planet. The eldest brother of Kurus, Duryodhan, even wanted to rape the wife of Arjun in the open assembly of ministers. After all the conditions laid down on Pandavas, Duryodhanís cousins, this arrogant, puffed-up Duryodhan did not keep his promise. He was responsible for setting fire to a house where once Pandavas had stayed for some time. He did all the treacherous work to destroy, ìmoralists,î Pandavas who were refused to get some portion of an inherited kingdom. They followed the principles of ethics and respects to the elderly.

One gentleman asked, ëWhy did the Pandavas fight, who were the protectors of morals and values of Vedas ?í I asked him, ìWhy did the police officers fight with thieves, robbers, rapists, or the so-called nice gentlemen behind doors, the pushers of drugs and opium?î Similarly, these days under the instructions of the Bible, these pushers are funding the missionaries for the Bible cause. So if any civilized human being tries to stop such rascals for the spread of criminal activities throughout this globe, he is not fighting but defending the real cause for the safeguards of worldís human civilization. THAT IS A REAL POLICE OFFICER. SO PANDAVAS WERE INSTRUCTED TO FIGHT BACK WITH KURUS FOR MAINTAINING THE PEACE FOR THE SOCIETY. Also the Old Testament (Bible), in the Chapter of ëEstherí , confirms the Vedic influence spread at different parts of our globe: ìNow it came about in the days of Ahasuerus ( Sanskrit name), that is, the Ahasuerus who was ruling as king from India to Ethiopia, (over) a hundred and twenty-seven jurisdictional districts. The name of his castle was Shushan ( Sanskrit name). Also Vashti, the queen herself held a banquet for the women at the royal house that belonged to the king Ahasuerus ñ and the king proceeded to say the wise men having knowledge of times (for in this way the kingís matter came before all those versed in law and legal cases).î Vishti (used different spelling in other Bibles to confuse the issue), the first queen, had refused to go in and display herself before the banquet of drunken king and men, who thought of nothing higher than drink and sex, so Vishti ( Sanskrit- word) was deposed.

Many men follow the Bible lesson on picking a wife and follow the kingís method of trying out women sexually to choose a mate (like a dog with a bitch), but few succeed in getting a true companion this way. When a man starts trying out women he rarely ever stops, but learns to have no faith in any woman and never knows the wonderful happiness of the journey down the pathway of life, arm with a true queen of his heart. Women who take the Bible lesson and follow Estherís lead (like a bitch throwing itself in front of sexually maniac dogs, studs), very seldom ever win more than the second prize, that of being a concubine, and soon they find that they are only second choice concubines for their man has found a new one or two. THE RESULTS: Every marriage in USA ends up in divorces and in many instances 3-4 marriages and still no satisfaction. The artificial Christians rally against the abortions throughout the United States organized by the Bible pushers to prove their faith in the Bible. HOW ARE THEY GOING TO CURTAIL ABORTIONS WHEN THEY CONTINUE TO PRAISE SUCH ACTIVITIES OF ESTHER OF THE BIBLE AND CONTINUE TO FOLLOW SUCH A JUMBLE OF HOAX AND NONSENSE EXAMPLES SET BY THE HEROS OF THE BIBLE, NOT IN LINE TO THE MORALS AND FAMILY VALUES? Just like the Holy Bible praises such sexual activities of Esther, in the same scenario many writers whose influence is derived from the Bible published in many newspapers to glorify such activities: ìWORLDíS MOST-MARRIED MAN GROOMING NO. 28, GLYNN ìSCOTTYî WOLFE WITH WIFE NO. 27 DAISY , WHOM HE PLANS TO DIVORCE.í ó A leading American Newspaper, July 11, 1990.

The Aryans fought until death if they could not win the war with Islamic intruders who had entered in India from the Middle East. When the women were left alone in the kingdom/palace, sex-manic Islamic Jihad followers used to rape unprotected Hindu women. Because of their chaste morals, they preferred to poison themselves and then later jumped into the fire pit ( Johar , called Hindu-Sati ). Vedic teaching itself built such great morals that people did not want to unleash the highest principles. It is automatic. It is not all artificial. It had nothing to do with men desiring their women to burn themselves alive. The women themselves had lived in such high morals and dignified characters through the Vedic teachings. Naturally, there is no help for those isolated incidents or misuse of these informations into radical forms or for making fun of the society as a whole. A young man 25 years of age of the Islamic faith asked me, ìWhy in the past, women in India had performed ëSati Prathaí and more recently why some living in the Middle East, had also done the same?î My reply was, ìThat in the first instance, when the Barbaric Islamic Tribes invaded the civilized communities of Bharat, raping, plundering, looting, arsoning, torturing and killing women, children, old people, the women of India being totally monogamous and chaste, took poison and then lept into fires to avoid the poisonous viciousness of the barbarians.î In the second instance after being lured to the Islamic counties of the Middle East, being promised well-paying professional jobs in the computer, nursing and secretarial fields, the women found that they were instead misled by lies and deceit and were forced into prostitution by these fanatic Muslims.

BECAUSE, I SAID, BEING OF A HIGH SPIRITUAL NATURE AND BEING PURE, THEY LEPT INTO THE FIRES TO PREVENT THE FANATICAL CRIMINALS OF THE MUSLIM BARBARIAN TRIBES AS WELL AS, THEIR PRESENT DAY DESCENDANTS, WHO ARE VIRTUALLY NO BETTER, FROM MOLESTING THEIR DEAD BODIES.î Such activities are allowed for the faithful under the instructions of the Koran.

The only evidence was provided by the fact that the night the young woman Farhal was buried, and this man was seeing coming out of a deserted mosque in the graveyard with a spade. On the basis of this evidence, he was convicted by the additional session judge of Gujranwala. Nasser challenged his conviction in the federal Islamic Shariat court, the highest Islamic court in Pakistan, the pleaded for justice under the Koranís Hudood ordinance but the court had to seek the help of Muslim scholars to ascertain what Islamic punishment could be awarded in such a case.

What will happen to this child once he grows up? (I) No trust, (ii) no faith, (iii) no liking and (iv) a revengeful attitude in general. Same way those Bible followers, who have been abusing their children, have followed the examples of Lotís incest in the cave with his two daughters.

This way, children growing have no faith, no trust. This system is the foremost reason for the ruination of life ó a serious spiritual-suicide. It must be stopped immediately by all means.

He always told that Bhagavad Gita was his mother of knowledge. THE REAL PURPOSE OF HUMAN LIFE IS TO RETURN BACK TO THE ëREAL HOMEí - VAIKUANTH BUT, AGAIN THERE ARE MANY SCIENTISTS WHO RELY ON MECHANICAL MEANS. The Bhagavad Gita discusses these points. The eternal sky is described in the Eight Chapter, in verses nineteen and twenty. We have a material understanding of the sky, with the sun, stars, moon etc. God Krishn explains that in the eternal sky there is no need of sun or moon, nor of fire or electricity, because the spiritual sky is already illuminated by the ë Brahmajyotií , the rays of the Supreme Lord. Brahmajyoti is in the spiritual sky, wherein the planets are named the Vaikunth and Goloka . The Lord resides eternally in His Supreme abode; but He can be approached from here also. There are innumerable planets in Brahmajyoti, just as there are in the material sky, but all these planets are spiritual, not material. God Krishn says in the Bhagavad Gita that anyone who can approach the spiritual sky need not return to the material sky. In the material sky, even if we live on the highest planet which is called Brahmaloka , we must still suffer the miseries of material existence of birth, disease, old age and death. No material being is free of them. Lord Krishn says that the living entities are traveling from one planet to another. We need not rely on mechanical arrangements to go to other planets. For anyone who wants to go to another planet, such as the moon, Bhagavad Gita instructs that there is a simple formula ñ even to go to the highest planet. If we practice a certain process as described in Bhagavad Gita,"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"Hrsikes Das Mitriya 50 one can go to the sun, the moon, or any other planet. However, Bhagavad Gita advises us not to go to any of these material planets, not even to the Brahamaloka which can also be reached by mechanical means after forty-thousand years. As mentioned earlier that in the spiritual sky there are innumerable planets, which are never annihilated, but there is one called Krishnlok, or Goloka Vrndavan , which is the Supreme Planet. Bhagavad Gita gives us the opportunity to leave this material world and to go to that eternal existence in the eternal abode of the Lord. Those who are trying to be lords over material nature due to attachment, pride, ego, false prestige, greed, lust, anger, ignorance, envy, untruthfulness, non-cleanliness, non-austerity, non-mercy, cannot have any chance of going back to the spiritual kingdom ñ no matter what they believe in. One may speak just by mouth mere words more than a million times, beat the drums, or put large posters all over town, have no meaning unless it is carried by the proper/ethical/and the highest moral standard of the Vedas. Have you, all, not tried enough to a position where this whole world has come closer to complete ruination, unless you want to blow it up? Our senses are so imperfect that we cannot even see many planets that exist within the material sky Vedic literature gives us information of many worlds that exist there. But one should always hanker after the spiritual sky and the supreme kingdom. Now, a question maybe raised: How do we approach the abode of the Supreme Lord? In the Eighth Chapter of the Bhagavad Gita, verses five through eight, the means for approaching the Lordís Supreme abode are given. IF THEY ARE FOLLOWED UNDER THE PROPER GUIDANCE WITH RIGHT ACTIONS, ONE CAN GO BACK TO REAL HOME IN THIS LIFE TIME OTHERWISE THEY WILL KEEP ON COMING BACK IN DIFFERENT BODIES (CYCLE OF BIRTH AND DEATH ó WILL BE DISCUSSED LATER).

(3) Always do right actions. It is hard to recommend the Bhagavad Gita since there are many commentaries and translations in English where authors have expressed their personal opinions without really touching on the true spirit of the Bhagavad Gita as it was spoken by Sri Krishn more than 5,190 years ago. So one has to hanker after a right teacher because one will come across many who would claim themselves to be very learned. Recently, many Krishnís devotees are becoming very expert in mixing and matching all religions, as one and the same. They are out there in fulfilling their egocentric qualities. They have started their demonsí infiltration acts. BHAGAVAD GITA IS LIKE A MAP. IF THE MAP IS FULL OF CONFUSIONS SHOWING WRONG DIRECTIONS, THEN IT WILL BE DIFFICULT TO REACH TO A PARTICULAR DESTINATION. I TELL THEM, ìDO NOT ADD ANYTHING IN VEDIC TEXTS.î JUST LEAVE THEM ALONE! WHEN PEOPLE OF THE WORLD ARE FRUSTRATED AND TIRED OF ALL MATERIAL SENSE- GRATIFICATIONS AND ANXIETIES, THEY MUST SEEK FOR A TRUE MAP TO REACH TO THEIR DESTINATION (SPIRITUAL KINGDOM). IF THE MAP IS CONFUSED AND DISTORTED BY WRONG ADDITIONS ETC., THEY WILL BE LOST AND THE SUFFERING, ON THE PLANET, WILL BE INTENSIFIED. FOR THE LAST 12 YEARS, I HAVE DONE EVERYTHING POSSIBLY TO BLOCK THEIR INTRUSION. THEY DONíT SEEM TO UNDERSTAND AND CONTINUE TO SPEAK THAT ALLAH IS O.K., JEHOVAH IS O.K., MOHAMMED IS O.K., THE BIBLE IS O.K., AND THE KORAN IS O.K., EVERYTHING IS O.K.

Does it not sound like a controlled mafia syndicated type of group trying to enforce their bum views on the masses and such large ignorant masses are following stupid ideas under the name of God?

If we have such faulty information as contained in the Bible, how can we call it a book of God?

BRUNO ó This great scientist was burned by the Inquisition Court for preaching the scientific principles of plurality of words and revolution of the earth around the sun, uttered after hearing the judgement of the court in his case, ìIt is perhaps with greater fear that you pass sentence upon me rather than I receive it.î RIDLEY and LATIMER ó Whose -fingers were burnt by Christians uttered the following words expressing their joy over their fate: ìWe shall this day light such a candle in England by Godís grace as shall never be put out.î So one can see through, that such utterance of words as spoken by Ridley and Latimer are coming true now.

The sun, while passing through twelve months, comes in touch with the twelve different signs of the zodiac and assumes twelve different names according to those signs.

When the sun travels in its southern course, the exact opposite is true ñ the duration of the night increases and day decreases. According to the Vedic texts, our universe has several moons and several suns. There are many planets which have their own moons. So it must not be a surprise to see the moon here and there in the preceding map. This map is just a brief illustration but there are volumes of pages explaining the life in them and their exact positions in the universe. MILKY WAYíS HOT CLOUDS: A major quest of modern cosmology, the science of determining the universeís content and order, is to pin down whether the cosmos is closed or open. If closed, the universe will eventually rebound on itself into a superhot, a superdense point; if open it will infinitely expand into cold, rubble-strewn darkness. Most cosmologists and Hindus believe in the closed model. A cyclical universe, expanding and contracting, is a key doctrine of Hindu cosmology. A closed universe requires a certain amount of overall mass to generate enough gravitational ìoomphî to reverse the cosmosís expanding momentum. The search for this mass is consuming many astronomers. Recently, scientists bumped into a little more hot and heavy stuff: huge numbers of relatively small gas clouds floating around our Milky Way galaxy. The clouds are causing dips in radio signals generated by the cosmosís most distant galaxies: Quasars. IN A BABY GALAXY FAR, FAR AWAY: In an astronomical survey conducted in California, the oldest space fossil yet from the early history of the cosmos was found. It is a quasar (for a quasi-stellar object) that is 14 billion light years distant. As a light year expresses time as well as spatial distance, this means we are viewing a snapshot of the quasar as it looked 14 billion years ago. They are small regions of super-energetic matter shining as brightly as a full-scale galaxy ñ a prodigious amount of energy. Quasars are the most-distant objects from us and also those closest in time to the Big Bang creation event of the cosmos that occurred many billion years ago. There is a calculation factor in Bhagavad Gita which can determine the"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"Hrsikes Das Mitriya 58 exact number of years of existence for our immediate material universe. This item factor can tell the remaining years left before its dissolution. This quasar is so close to the Big Bang it is forcing astrophysicists to greatly revamp their theories on how matter orders itself. IT HAS IMPLICATIONS THAT SUPPORT HINDU COSMOLOGY, WHEREIN THE ENERGY/MATTER OF THE UNIVERSE IS THE PATTERNED PROJECTION OF AN INTELLIGENT CONSCIOUSNESS, NOT MERELY AN ACCIDENTAL EXPLOSION AND ITS AFTERMATH. The British, backed under the Bibleís influence had killed many Vedic followers and forced the conversion of millions into such inferior ideas of the compulsory Bible studies; due to their hateful bringing up for looking down other non-followers of the Bible as heathens. The whole world is watching and yet the Bible followers are backing up such cheap works through missionaries to force people to bring them under their subjection of stone age mentalities. This kind of situation is very rewarding to the majority of Christians living in U.S.A. They are just getting many advantages under its cover like eat ësoul foodí and get welfare to non-deservings.

If the entire Bible is banned, what will be the ultimate result? : A WORLD OF PEACEFUL SOCIETY. Galileo , an astronomer, mathematician and physicist, lived from 1564 to 1642.

IT IS ALSO A FACT THAT THE BIBLE STUDIES HAVE SERIOUSLY CONTRIBUTED TO CRIMES EVER SINCE ITS FOUNDATION.

Their Old Treatment also contributed the Jewsí displacement from the Middle East by Islamís prophet Mohammed who had copied the Old Testament and named it the Koran with more additions. A hate breeds insensitivity and breeds nothing else but hate. New Twist: The Old Testament had further increased the breeding of criminal violence and hate, not now under the instructions of Jehovah and Moses but under the instructions of Allah and Mohammed of the Koran which caused the displacement of Jews from their land. If they want their future generations not to go through what they have gone through in the past, they must surrender to the complete understanding of the Vedic texts and spread their teachings throughout this globe as soon as possible. We can improve by examples of the past. When a child goes out of his way, a mama tries to explain him not to be indulged into wrong activities which can hurt the child, eventuality. If the child still persists with bad behavior, the mama may repeat the same explanations 3-4 times to correct him and if he still continues to maintain wrong habits, then the mama must spank him and later might give a harsh punishment to correct her child. Jews still follow the Old Testament which was the leading cause of their displacement from the Middle-East. They must give it up their bad taste. That is a fact!

Gita 2:12) • ìAs the embodied soul continuously passes, in this body, from childhood to boyhood to youth and then to old age, similarly the soul passes into another body at the time of death.î .. (Bg. Gita 2:13) The next body could be human or animal body according to the sum of oneís activities and desires. We are not this body. As long as the driver is inside the car, the car can be driven but as soon as the driver comes out of the car the car is dead. Similarly, at the time of death you (driver) give up the material clothes made of 5-elements: water, fire, earth, air and ether and change to different body. Just as a person puts on new garments, giving up the old ones, similarly, the soul accepts new material bodies giving up the old and useless ones. The body changes but the soul remains the same. Although there are many movie frames, when seen consecutively they appear as one picture. Similarly, although oneís body is changing at every second, it appears to be the same body ( Bhagavad Gita ). You might have seen a blind man, so he is not his eyes; you might have seen a person with no legs, so he is not his legs; or you might have seen the person with no hands, so he is not his two hands. So these conclude that we are different than this body, we are not the hands, legs, eyes etc., then who are we? Can you point out to yourself? WHO ARE YOU?

Who is this my person sitting in your body? According to Bhagavad Gita that you ìSelfî is called sprit-soul. Ignorance of consciousness itself is the greatest cause of self-spiritual suicide. From this ignorance alone have arisen multiple stupidities, many, out of context, learnings like: ëThe frog of a tiny well.í A frog of a tiny well thinks there is no ocean beyond the four walled boundaries of his tiny well and from such kind(s) of concepts arose what is the so-called modern day prejudice; in order words: ìFoolsí Phenomena.î An arrogant dog is extremely prejudiced that he is always barking and growling at the passers-by.

If we do not then these problems of hate and violence increase a million folds by leaps and bounds similar to an oil soaked rolling-ball down a hill which will accumulate more and more dirt particles on its path. So we must do every thing to stop that machine which endangers souls and increases the accumulation of dirt more and more in its path.

One can feel the presence of soul by a simple test.: Anyone, can understand what is spread all over the body ñ IT IS THE CONSCIOUSNESS. Everybody is conscious about the pains and pleasures of the body in part or as a whole. This spreading of consciousness is limited within oneís own body. The pains and pleasures of oneís body are unknown to another. Just like you cannot feel the pains and pleasures of a cow going through a slaughter house, similarly your pains and pleasures are confined to you. If you are suffering from cancer that pain is confined to you not even to your dearest loved ones except they can sympathetic toward your miseries. You have to pay the price.

Therefore, it proves beyond any reasonable doubt that each and everybody contains an individual soul; the symptom of the soulís presence is perceived as an individual consciousness as stated in Bhagavad Gita .

The house they live in ó sooner or later has to be given up, simply by changing hands. No one is able to control any material possession indefinitely. Yet these hoarders continue to hoard Godís resources: land, wealth, and other valuables. Even after acquiring all these possessions, they are constantly thinking that something more must be done for their future generation by sucking the rights of those who are still alive, by making 500 years of planning for their future generation and in the process hurting millions of souls who do not belong to their groupism/ideology.

In California one American Hypnotist examined the cases of 1,000 Americans, mostly bodies dressed in white clothes. Under the influence of hypnotism, they were transgressed to their past lives. Some were living in China, and some were living in Korea. 90% of them had different bodily looks than they were born into.

This person mind needs to be examined in a mental asylum. Any logical person can understand this above simple explanation about the presence of soul in animals or humans. As explained earlier, maybe animal consciousness level is lower than most of human bodies except mentally retarded grown ups, murderers, rapists and other wrongdoers. The Bhagavad Gita very clearly instructs us that one must not hanker after material gains except whatever is necessary. This planet earth is moving for billions of years and trillions of souls entered into the planet of earth through mothersí wombs (animals or humans), yet this planet earth continues to go round and round. As to this date, yet, no one is able to take the gross body with the self at the time of material death. Not even a single cent! Only thing one can take are good deeds as their greatest possession for better life. NOT THE BIBLEíS KIND OF CONSCIOUSNESS. They have continued to add sufferings on this planet earth ever since its inception. These bodily designations: white or black, Mexican or American, Christian or Muslim, dog or human are temporary phases of the soul. These all material bodies are made of five elements as discussed earlier. The temperature of the body is 98.5 degrees (Heat); Due to hot climate or hard work, the body perspires (Water); one breathes the air which moves the cell in oneís body (human or animal), i.e., air; at the time of death, the body turned into ashes (earth). Therefore, according the Vedic texts, the souls can take birth in fire, or extreme cold climates, not only on our planets but different planets. The Vedas say that soul can never be burned. God Krishn has stated about the"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"The Ultimate Guide for One World Order 71 constitution of soul to his dear friend Arjun. So different compositions of these five elements can provide a material dress for the soul (driver of the car) to live in different parts of the universe. For example our senses are limited. We cannot even recognize a person just a thousand feet away. We also donít have the proper eyes to see our own soul. We can perceive its presence through Vedic texts and by proper recitations of the mantras. Due to our limited senses, we are handicapped to see the life in other planets. Recently the scientists have shown that there is an existence of life in high temperatures. The mission went to the moon and came up with the answer: ìNo Lifeî, i.e., Void- finish and concluded. If we seek the help of the Vedas, we find that God has created these planets for some purpose(s). DO YOU EVER CREATE ANYTHING FOR NOTHING? Unless one is a fool! From perfection comes perfection. Nothing else! But from imperfect human senses come out many imaginations, guess works, theories which later are speculating to be different from as found originally. Vedic texts give us the information to put us on the right track, right frame of mind. They give us the direction to lead us into correct findings for those who are inquisitive. Vedic science never taught us to block our logical progress for further evolution in any field: science and spiritual searches within. From deceits and lies one cannot reach to truthfulness. Only from truth, one can reach to the ultimate truth. So lies and conceits will never make your experiment successful. WHAT HAPPENS TO THE SOUL AT THE TIME OF MATERIAL DEATH? DOES IT CLING TO THE ASHES UNTIL THE COMING OF UNKNOWN MESSIAH? These questions are very important for people to understand. As mentioned earlier that within 2-3 hours of material death, the body starts smelling fowl. The question is raised to the SOUL (THE DRIVER OF THE CAR): WOULD YOU LIKE TO STAY NEXT TO THE GARBAGE?"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"Hrsikes Das Mitriya 72 While you are living in your present body, you (soul) want to make sure that your kitchen and bathrooms are kept cleaned, so how can you (soul) be sticking to the rottening-smelling dead body? Though advancement of science, the cosmoses are not the part of the Bible scienceñ because according to them earth is flat but they boast themselves as if they are the greatest contributors in this world for the development of science and in furtherance of cosmos studies. Even if they got this much perception of advancement in the cosmos etc., yet the Bible followers are sticking to the belief that one-day the messiah would come and raise them (their souls) with their dead bodies to take them to heaven. The beliefs are something which may not be true. It is normally developed out of personís ignorance, country of birth, or from a family heritage pass down from grandfather to father to son, or due to historical beliefs, but eternal truth is one and the same for every living entity regardless of oneís beliefs, place of birth or his/her teachings from the parents. Christians, Jews and Muslims are very expert in decorating the dead bodies. Today, in a materially advanced country like America, we find almost everyone is decorating the deads with tuxedos and very costly coffins, and then they bury them into the ground with the understanding that one day an unknown incoming messiah shall come and pick them from the coffin with the body and soul. Unfortunately, these people keep on occupying more and more land for their baseless pursuits. This, such land, can be utilized for the cultivation, but they add up more and more land worldwide for burying their deads. Also, these dead bodies are eaten by insects which further develop into the breeding ground for millions of insects and germs causing all sorts of viral and bacterial infections in the present living bodies. Therefore, body must be cremated as soon as possible for preventing further spread of diseases. This way one can maintain hygienic conditions rather add up more disease.

They have made a big business by selling parts of humansí bodies. Each year, research to tackle unwanted diseases have increased tremendously yet there is a constant failure as more and more diseases have sprung up. Ten years ago nobody heard of AIDS, but this is becoming the most difficult disease to tackle by scientists here in the U.S.A. AIDS is a disease related to sex. Everybody knows this by now. By adding chemicals to the human bodies of an AIDSí victims, it might temporally keep him alive but yet more and more people continue to add on the AIDSí virus list. We definitely need doctors but many of them are on a rampage to loot money legally from the common masses under the name of their skilled-profession. This is a service -- just like any other human being is involved into. WHY IS A FARMER, LOOKED DOWN OR PUT DOWN?

So coming back to AIDSí question, we find that deficiency in oneís immunity causes to acquire AIDS (ACQUIRE IMMUNE DEFICIENCY) DISEASE. Vedas have explained that the human body must be kept balanced through proper diets, through control of senses, through control of mind etc. Above all, manís mind cannot be controlled if he is having uncontrolled sex.

The animals have mating seasons by the control of nature but the humans can exercise their free will in positive or negative directions. When a humanís body is indulged in too much sex and wrong activities like drugs etc., the cells in the body give up to fight the germs due to the loss of control of bodyís balance. One of the main factors the Vedas explain above the importance of the semen (seed). THE SEMEN IS THE BALANCE OF THE BODY, WHICH KEEPS THIS BODY UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE ëSELFí. The Vedas explain that 64 drops of blood make a drop of the semen which is the integral force for bodyís organs to function properly. All the elements needed to sustain the human body are present in the semen. Though people are taking artificially many elements in the form of vitamins but they are not very effective. The semen is the centrifugal force for sustaining body, mind and soul. In a proper balance. SO EXCESSIVE SEX LEADS INTO IMMUNE DEFICIENCY. Once the immunity is weakened to fight back the virus, the bodyís functions surrender and then the actual deterioration of the body sets-in. So it is extremely necessary for humans to have control on their bodies through senses and mind as stated in the Bhagavad Gita by THE PERSONALITY OF GODHEAD SRI KRISHN. None of the applications change when we read Physicís laws, Chemistryís equations, Mathematics from China to U.S.A., from Russia to Brazil or from Iran to France, but when it comes to religion everyone has invented his/her own religion with all sorts of concocted ideas. The Vedas relate to the true science of ëSelf- Realizationí which is in harmony with laws of nature and present day science of the cosmos. Vedic teachings are absolutely non- sectarian. Due to confusion, people are led into such kind of beliefs: This is our Christian God; this is our Jew God; or this is our Muslim God. What a shame?

AS A MATTER OF FACT, CHRISTIANITY IS THE FULFILMENT OF JUDAISM AS THE APOSTLES AND THE EVANGELISTS AND EARLY CHURCH FATHERS USED TO REPEAT.

While the Jewish scholars and Rabbis were trying to tame its excess through reinterpretation, Christianity took it over in all its exclusiveness and literalness. Similarly, the Christian God turns out to be more cruel at heart than the Judaic God. Jehovah of the Old Testament thundered a good deal and pitilessly smote his adversaries and very often even his own chosen people but that was the end of it all. The Christian God, on the contrary, pursued his enemies, the unbelievers, beyond the grave and caused them to roast in eternal fires. The Jews had only sheol, an abode of the dead, and no proper Hell in the Christian sense of the term. THE HELL OF ETERNAL PUNISHMENT AND FIRE WAS A CHRISTIAN CONTRIBUTION WHICH WAS LATER ADOPTED BY ISLAM TOO IN ALL THE FULLNESS OF ITS VENGEANCE. The Semitic religions have done the most destructive disservice to the cause of spiritual life throughout this planet. By offering an offensive theology leading to a cruel and fervent ethics of persecution of other people, they repel men and women of reason and sensitivity and bring the very concept of religion into disrepute. This accounts for the Rational Movement of Europe of the last two or three hundred years and its temper of distrust and even denial of all religions. The pioneers of this movement read their Bible closely and they discovered that it abounded in brutal superstitions and preached degraded ethics, and they, therefore, rejected it. Many western writers have provided a rationalist critique(s) of Semitic religions; but the time has come that right solutions are provided in light of Vedic texts. According to Vedic texts, Semitic texts violate not only ordinary reason and ethics but also deeper truths of the spirit. They lack larger charity.

Christianity was an artificial graft on the soil of Europe. Here we need not go into the question how it was foisted on its pagan people. But as Christianity triumphed, these people lost their Gods and their spiritual roots. Their contact with Bharat (presently known as India) was snapped and for a thousand years they lived in isolation behind an intellectual Iron Curtain. But now for some time, things have been changing. Europeís spirit has been awakening. Reason has played a big role. The spirit of the Western youths is seeking a new dimension, and it finds itself naturally attracted by the SANATAN DHARM, OR AGE-OLD WISDOM OF THE VEDAS . The work is peaceful and silent. There are no armies of soldiers, no crusaders and might is right type preachers, no budget, no language studies, no paraphernalia of hired missionaries. In this work, the spiritual land of the Aryans (Bharat-mata) claims nothing for itself, no empire, no earthly glory, not even spiritual leadership. How can an eternal mother ask anything from the child? She is out there to distribute knowledge and true understanding of higher consciousness.

It is essential for the animal to bleed to death, and he or she must be fully conscious, and cannot be tranquilized or stunned. In the first Chapter, it is discussed that animal eating is extremely dangerous to health. It is absolutely not clean food.

In recent years, many Semitic-based teachings have incorporated God being omnipresent, omnipotent and omniscient, without having the slightest understanding about these terms. It has great spiritual understanding. The Bible never believed in Omnipresent God. But again to keep the Christianity alive, they continue to add few things here and there out of context without any logical and spiritual understanding of any kind. Like a barking dog has no meaning. Vedas have been teaching, ever since time immemorial, that God is present everywhere and in everyone and that is the very first reason why the followers of Vedas do not believe in killing of animals or killing or burning human beings because they did not believe in the inconsistent teachings of the Bible. Saint Xavier burned live human beings in South India for his forced conversions into Christianity under the instructions of Pope of the Vatican. Bruno was burned alive for teaching the true science which had opposed the Bibleís creation science, absolutely a baseless theory with no head or tail. THE U. S. A.

Why did God of the Bible, Jehovah, tell Moses and the high priest Aaron to kill all the people of Egypt, including children and women?

It is an empty mind which creates many evil thoughts because they donít know anything better. This system has been created by Economic-Manipulators and it is kicking them back in the rear so bad that has created 3-trillion budget- deficit here in the USA. The Medical lobby is so great that they are seducing the wealth by charging enormous amount of fees for their services and medical bills. Medicaid (free medical) is sucked out by doctors through the process of unreasonable charges. The whole society is out there to suck each other on different levels. The attorneys are advertising to plant different vicious ideas in the minds of common masses to find business and creating cases which are baseless, hopeless. Heavy television commercials are adding false cases. The whole system is on the verge of collapse. No faith on fellow Americans. The whole society is out there to find ways to make millions as quickly without any proper qualifications. There is nothing wrong in making millions but it should be within certain guidelines. Those morals have disappeared and money is being made by creating confusions and outrageous charges both by skilled labors and others as discussed above.

Pastor Best calls everyone heathens who does not believe in the forced views of inconsistent ignorant teachings of the Bible. At the same time trying to ponder such words: \"Thou shall love thy neighbor\". How can there be any love in thy neighbor when there is constant teachings of hate side by side in the Bible? First manufacture criminals and then cultivate by such forced views: \"Thou shall not kill\". Let us say your father is a noble person who has never killed even an ant, would you tell him unnecessarily: \"Thou shall not kill\". Your father will laugh on you by such words: \"Am I a criminal?\" That my daughter speaks such harsh words on her noble father who had done nothing but served the family. He will advice you to tell such words to criminals who have been murderers. So the Bible was written for murderers and women-hunters in the Middle-east desert. Man has a right to condemn the wrong actions and is the utmost duty of noble people to defend the Dharm . Due to ignorance, one develops demoniac qualities and from such demoniac qualities \"HATE GROUPS\" are formed.

Out of ignorance, he might kill this dog not accepting the fact that dogís soul once had been in his fatherís body. This is ignorance, and from ignorance comes stupidities and stupidities are the biggest cause of \"BELIEFS PREJUDICES\".

EVEN WE LEARN MANY THINGS FROM ANIMALS. FOR EXAMPLE: WHEN YOU SPREAD SOME RICE IN YOUR GARDEN, THE BIRDS SIMPLY EAT THEIR SHARE AND FLY AWAY BUT YOU WILL NEVER SEE THE BIRDS EVER HOARDING. Animals have mating sessions and they are not constantly involved in sexual pleasures like present day, the so-called, humans. Their entire humanís life is being wasted just to find ways to have more and more sex pleasures. They are exercising their free will into reverse directions. If man is a logical animal, why is he going against nature ( worse than animals in his constant search for sexual pleasures)? Every possible gadget has been designed here in the USA to fulfill sexual pleasures and ultimately the result is frustration and no happiness. In Rigved , the Omnipresence and Omnipotence of God have been described as follows: HE WHOSE EYES ARE EVERYWHERE, WHOSE MOUTH IS IN ALL SIDES, WHOSE ARMS ARE ALL AROUND AND WHOSE FEET ARE IN ALL DIRECTIONS IS ONE AND ONLY ONE DIVINE BEING, WHO IS THE CREATOR OF THE HEAVEN AND THE EARTH AND WHO BY MEANS OF ALL SPREADING ARMS INFUSES LIFE INTO ALL BEINGS.

These young girls like to play and put these dolls next to their beds while going to sleep. They feel that their dolls are absolutely part and parcel of their lives but they eventually grow out of it once they got older. Similarly, a childís imagination is not properly developed regarding God unless he/she is not involved with some tangible item. When we talk about God as Omnipotent, Omnipresent, and Omniscient, normally many children may not understand these verbal philosophical discourses. So an artist helps the child to understand the psychology behind the picture of the Almighty with many heads, faces, arms. In Rigved, verse 6, 45, and 16: \"O man! Praise God who is One and One only and who is the Omnipotent and Omniscient Lord of all beings\" Pastor Best writes that anyone outside the Christendom is a heathen. Answer: Mr. Best must hear what he himself professing from the Bible. If he does not follow what he professes, this simply means he is misleading and cheating innocent souls and thereby keeping the society in the darkness. Even Jesus Christ said, \"THOU shall not kill\". If he meant the killing only applicable to humans, he could have used the right word, murder - rather than killing. Hope, the Bible pushers donít come up with a new statement that Jesus was wrong by using jugglery of words. They are very expert when it comes to play with words. The killing applies for animals and humans alike. The right word for killing human is 'Murderí. MR. BEST DOES NOT FOLLOW THE VERY FIRST COMMANDMENT OF WHAT HE HIMSELF HAD BEEN PREACHING. SO WHO HAS TO BE HEATHEN NUMBER 1? Mr. Best writes that there are many gods of wood and outside Christendom. WHY IS THE CROSS MADE OF WOOD OR STONE OR PAINTED ON THE WALL WITH COLORS?

Basically, the sign of cross has become an obsession for the followers to take the revenge from the Jews. This vicious cycle is going on ever since Jesus was hanged. On the other hand, deities are emitting pure love of God in Vedic temples which are being carved artistically in Godís image. IF GOD MADE MAN IN HIS IMAGE, WHY CANíT MAN CARVE THE DEITIES IN HIS IMAGE? NATURALLY, THEY MUST REPRESENT GOD BY ANY LOGIC, MR. BEST IN HIS HOT ADVERTISEMENT IS TRYING TO TEACH GENERAL PUBLIC THE HATE TOWARD THE PROFESSIONS OF ARCHITECT, DESIGNER, ARTIST, AND SCULPTOR. In other words no one should draw any picture of oneís father otherwise they will be considered heathens according to the Bible studies. Just like an Artist has got the eyes to draw the picture of oneís mother, similarly, the pure devotee of the Lord has vision to see Godís image. So one must not try to conclude and make judgement based on the limited boundaries within its confinement of prejudicial teachings of the Bible and the Koran.

There are many faiths and beliefs based on different religions but they are temporary. The faith may change from one object to another object but \" SANATAN DHARM\" will always remain eternal and fixed. It cannot be changed. Example: Heat cannot be separated from fire; Similarly, liquidity cannot be taken away from water. In the same mode, Sanatan Dharm cannot be taken away from the living entities. It is important to know the eternal function of the eternal living entities in order to know what the Sanatan Dharm is. According to great sage Ramanujacarya : \"The one without beginning and without end. It is the business of all the people of the world. It is absolutely not a sectarian concept\". Now a particular religion faith may have some beginning in the history of human society, but SANATAN DHARM lies outside of history, for it belongs to the living beings, who have no birth and who never die, who continue to live after the destruction of the material body, just as they lived before its formation. This also can be understood by this example: All people and animals have soul and the consciousness level of each SELF is evolving from the lowest specie of life to a higher specie of life. Evolving of the consciousness of oneís soul is absolutely one directional that is from the lowest conscious specie of life to the highest specie (human); once one is in human form of life, one can exercise oneís freewill, that is either to evolve his/her consciousness to higher level by simply surrendering to God Krishn with the proper understanding as stated by THE GOD HIMSELF in Bhagavad Gita , or revert back into animal kingdom due to oneís filthy habits and animality behaviors. You can well see that many people around us behave like dogs, some are very poisonous like snakes, some people are always ready to kill others like ferocious animals - like wolves, hounds, tigers etc..

This is a fact! The nature continues to play its role. It has not stopped because the Bible followers have decided differently. God Krishn says in Bhagavad Gita that oneís own activities and desires lead the soul to accept a different material body, in the next life, for the satisfaction and fulfillment of certain behaviors suited by that particular body. Those souls in humansí bodies who are vicious like poisonous snakes by their nature, the nature, automatically, rewards such souls with the bodies of snakes in the next life cycle in accordance to the degree of their viciousness. One cannot fight the nature. If one tries to conquer the nature, without being harmonious, the mother nature simply slaps back - in other way to look at it that he/she gets a reward of a particular body well facilitating soulís desires while in the human form of life. That is the reason, we got all sorts of vicious animals. Tigers, snakes are the products due to humanís fight against humansí nature for higher consciousness. Those women and men constantly involved in orgies of sex are provided the perfect bodies of dogs and bitches for the fulfillment of their desires inconsistent to human ways. Human is the highest specie in this kingdom so he/she has to be an example to other rather than a gross body of senses. Sometime it has been debated that if a dog is better than a human, who has nothing but nonstop orgies of sex with low/cheap women. At least a dog has a mating season, well controlled by the natureís arrangement. What about lusty humans? Such humans are misusing their freewill; the nature has provided after going through unlimited cycles of birth and death from the lowest specie of life to the highest. God does not interfere in oneís desires. There are many humans whose only aim in life is to simply hoard the entire worldís wealth. The mice and rats are the prime examples of hoarding food in their mouse-holes.

In quality, we can be similar to God Krishn but in quantity we are minute just like the droplets of an ocean. Ask yourself: \"Am I God?\" If so, why are you suffering with material anxieties and various bondages of this life? After the second World War, the whole world experienced the baby boom. Where did they come from? Here it is confirmed from Bhagavad Gitaís verse 22 in chapter 2 : \"As a person puts on new garments, giving up old one, similarly, the soul accepts new material bodies, giving up old and useless ones\". As we have discussed earlier, a carpenter using an electric saw to cut a piece of lumber does not become the electric saw. He still remains the carpenter. Similarly, soul accepting various bodies do not make him a Christian or a Jew or a Dog or an American body. He will always remain an infinitesimal soul with varying degrees of consciousness. All 4-legged or 2-legged bodies are absolutely temporary in nature (the soul remains the same even after passing through so many forms of bodies); therefore, for the \"Self\", it is the utmost duty of each individual to respect all living entities regardless of oneís situation of birth. Humans are not designed to eat animals. Only the animals eating animals are provided carnivorous bodies to facilitate their desires. Naturally, one is not simply going to stand and watch oneís family to be consumed by an invading ferocious animal or bitten by a snake. Again, nature has provided tigers or lions to stay in jungles and they rarely infringe in the town. They know the limitations of their boundaries but most humans do not understand this simple point. By the arrangements of the Almighty, they live in dense forests in order to satisfy their propensities. Have you seen a dog pray? But humans do. Why? So that they can advance to higher planets or back to the REAL HOME (VAIKUNTH) right after giving up the material human dress.

One must do everything possible to stop such aggressors and help in the establishment of the Sanatan Dharm - Universal Science for the ultimate peace on our planet and as well as for upgrading the consciousness among people in general. In this world, every one of us knows somebody lesser than us, somebody equal to us, somebody greater than us. But as far as the Supreme Personality of Godhead is concerned, great sages of Bharat have concluded by research and experiment that none is equal to Him or greater. Godís energies are multifarious and they are working automatically, according to His desire. Suppose you are an artist. To paint a picture of a nice flower, one has to take a piece of paper, brush, mix the colors and then one must draw and paint. Do you think that the painted flower has just come out automatically? Similarly, when one goes in the garden, one can see many beautiful flowers blooming. They have been artistically painted by nature. What is a nature? Nature is a working instrument, an energy. Without the energy working, how could the rose bloom so beautifully from the bud? There has to be some energy, and this energy is called the Krishn ís energy.

The Absolute Truth is He, from whom everything is generated. In Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 10, verse 8 , God Krishn says: I am the source of every thing; from the entire creation flows out of My energy. So we must understand that Krishn is the origin of everything and He is the Supreme Controller. Just look up one night in the clear sky, and you can well see unlimited planets on just a tiny spot. On this planet earth which is insignificant in size in comparison to our immediate universe, we have many oceans, many mountains, many skyscrapers. If one travels 2-3 million miles above our planet earth, this planet would look like a tiny spot. Our earth would look just like other millions of planets floating in the sky like the swabs of cotton balls. Now we are trying to understand the planetary system, yet we are not able to finish the study of our nearest planet, the moon. What to talk of millions and billions of planets! This is all big show off, manís ego and absolutely wasted resources with billions of dollars expenditure at the cost of increased human sufferings. Recently, several books are written by the top most scientists on the evolution of mindís consciousness but all these books will not lead people back to the original source because the writers have systematically avoided to mention the origin of all the originsí. These puffed-up egoists want to write volumes of books to prove themselves that they are the authority when they have borrowed every bit of these ideas from the original source of Vedic texts. If people follow Vedas , we can get the entire knowledge of His cosmic manifestation. From Brahmasamhita , we get this knowledge: \"By the glaring effulgence emanating from Krishn ís body (called Brahmajyoti ) innumerable universes are created consisting of innumerable suns, innumerable moons, and innumerable planets.

Every one of us is some what a controller of something. You are a controller; I am a controller. But above us there is another controller, and above him there is another controller. You may go on searching for controller after controller, and when you come to the Supreme controller - He who is not controlled by anyone but who controls everyone else - His name is Krishn . Sometimes a dog starts thinking that he is also a controller, sometimes barks, sometimes jumps, sometimes sticks his tongue out and then all of a sudden his master pulls the lace and immediately this stupid dog knows that he is controlled by his master. Once this dog is reminded who is his boss, for time being, he starts walking straight without any fuss. Great sage Swami Prabhupadjee , world authority in the final knowledge of spiritual science, spoke: \"Those who have developed love of God are enjoying transcendental pleasures at every moment by seeing the artistic work of Krishn everywhere\". How can one talk about love of God, when one is contradicting oneself by having so much hate toward those who do not belong to their enrolled group or toward defenseless cows and other animals? Vedic teachings do discriminate with the wrongdoers regardless of their birth or even if they are born to the same parents who are following the Vedic system. There is no such thing as 'automaticí. It is a science and it must be applied in our day to day activity after one is guided under the proper instructions of a qualified teacher. These days it has become a cheap business to write a book without the qualification.

How many people got a chance to study mathematics to the fullest extent? Not whole lot! Similarly, many souls are born to Hindu parents who are kept absolutely ignorant to Vedic knowledge. They have not even open the first page of Bhagavad Gita . So it would be misleading and deceiving those who are looking for right answers by turning it down this great valuable knowledge of Vedas, seeing some ignorants are born in the families of Hindu ancestors. The Vedas always have taught that the magistrateís son cannot be a magistrate automatically. He has to study.

These two ( Vedas ) are the beacons that warn us to turn toward that goal of universal brotherhood. You do not find any of the universal brotherhood in the Bible and the Koran. Vedas are talking of universal brotherhood on the platform of \"Spirit-soul\" with \"clear-crystal\" understanding rather than on bodily-platform(s) presented in two books. Therefore, it is absolutely imperative, in order to achieve the ultimate peace and Godís Kingdom, one must not kill cows or other animals like goats, pigs and must not support their killings by eating them.

Instead of looking into their criminal activities like hoarding, jealousy for control as a racist group, they have not even spared, great Apostles for peace, Mahatma Gandhi and Dr. Radhakrishnan by lumping them either the Jews or the agents of the Jews. Ironically, the Afro-Americans are now taking the Bible more seriously than those who imposed upon them, initially. They as a group have started doing their forceful ways to achieve their rights, \"Might is Right\". Many youths, among Afro-Americans, are involved in drug-trafficking, robbing Convenient Stores out of hopelessness. These are the multiplications of criminal activities through the inconsistent teachings of the Bible and the Koran. The confusions have been created long before by the cheaters and those who want to be cheated and those continue to follow hoaxes.

Both are pronounced God even though we may be talking about god, \" Devatas\" . So just to remove this confusion, a great sage, used the word 'Demigodí which means not exactly the God but one with lesser powers than Him. In one tiny planet in comparison to the whole universe, we have many countries with many Presidents and many Secretaries of various departments, For example in USA, here the President is the highest power but under him there are, Secretary of State, Secretary of Finance, Secretary of Agriculture who are helping to carry his mission of the government affairs. The Presidentís mission is further carried through the appointments of ambassadors to various countries. Many Senators and Congressmen are working in the system of his government. Similarly, God has many demigods who look after many duties at the direction of God Krishn . \"Those whose minds are distorted by material desires surrender unto the demigods and follow the particular rules and regulations of worship according to their own natures . . . \" Bg.

In a university, one can find that there are many teachers on the same subject. Some may be very good teachers and some may be lesser effective than others. Regardless of their effectiveness in teaching, all teachers must follow the basic principles of Physics or Mathematics. If a student is enrolled to study mathematics and he is not kept within the logic of mathematics, would he be able to progress in the subject? The equations would not be solved. Similarly, Jesus tried to misuse his powers of miracles by compromising. He learned high spiritual science from the Brahmins of Vedas in India from his age 13 through 29 while visiting there. For example making water into wine as Jesus performing his miracles resulted into \"Drunkard Society\". In the USA, Mothers Against Drunk Drivers (MADD): \"No, no it was just a symbolic.\" \"He was the only son of God\" I asked her: \"Does anyone create anything for nothing?\" The woman at MADD: \"No\". An insane person will create something for nothing, specially, if one is a God or a son of God, He is not going to create anything for nothing. He must have a purpose. The woman at MADD; \"That is correct\" I asked her: \"What is the purpose of Jesus making water into wine?\" I further spoke out; \"MADD is trying hard to stop the alcohol use among drivers artificially.

So we get various teachers who are sent by God from time to time and this is well confirmed in Bhagavad Gita Chapter4, Verse 8: \"I advent Myself millennium after millennium to annihilate the miscreants, or as well as to reestablish the principles of religion and also to deliver the pious\". One retired Colonel from the US Air Force asked me a question. \"Is Jesus the only son of God? \" I asked the Colonel, \"Was he the only Colonel and there could not be any Colonel replacing him? \" Somebody will question, how could He be born?

Normally, the Chief would wear special fireproof clothes before helping to extinguish the fire.

ISNíT IT INCREDIBLE? NO COST TO ANY HUMAN BEINGS FOR RAISING A POOR DEFENSELESS MOTHER COW. COW IS DEFINITELY MOTHER TO ALL BECAUSE WE ALL ARE RAISED ON HER MILK FROM INFANCY.

How do you know that the mother who raised you from the infancy is your real mother? Because she could breast-feed you. Can a human-mama continue to give milk? As a matter of fact, human-mamaís milk is limited to an infant and is for a very short duration. Mother cow milk is not limited to an infant but unlimited to the entire family day in and day out. The thankless uncivilized, the so-called human beings, support the most abominable act of violence under the injunction of the Bible and the Koran by murdering her for their stomachs and the leaders of this world call such injunctions as part of different religious beliefs.

Just like someone catches the train from New York to go to Los Angeles. During this train journey, one may watch others talking, sleeping and some may be watching ever-changing scenery outside the moving train. But sooner or later, one has to get down at Los Angeles. Getting on the train from New York is like taking birth (entrance to planet of death, earth) and reaching to Los Angeles is like the end of journey (bodily death) after going through many sceneries on the way to the end of journey.

He is ever-ready, giving chance to souls to improve their lifeís conditions. Some look at them as a form of punishment. Some look at them sinful.

In Istanbul, Turkey, there is a famous library called Makteb-e-Sultania which is reputed to have the largest collection of ancient West Asian literature. In the Arabic Section of that Library is an anthology of ancient Arabic poetry. That anthology was compiled from an earlier work in A. D. 1742 under the orders of the Turkish ruler Sultan Salim. The pagesí of that volume are made of HAREER - a kind of silk used for writing on. Each page has a decorative gilded border. It may be recalled that gilding pages of sacred books is an ancient custom associated with old Sanskrit scriptures found in Java and other places. The anthology itself is known as SAYAR-ul-okul. It is divided into three parts, the first part contains biographic details and the poetic compositions of pre-Islamic Arabian poets, the second part embodies accounts and verses of poets of the period beginning just after Prophet Mohammed up to the end of Banee-Ummayya dynasty. The"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"The Ultimate Guide for One World Order 129 third part deals with later poets up to the end of Khalifa Harun- al-Rashidís times. Incidentally \" Banee\" means \"Vanee\" and Ummayya as in Krishnayya are Sanskrit names. According to the Koran, Music and Islam do not go together. Prophet Mohammed used to give punishment to those who played music. So the poetry could not be part of the Islamic system. According to Islam and the Koran music and poetry are considered very definitely \" Kufer\" , infidelsí work. Though it is considered \" Kufer\" according to the Koran, Allah, and Mohammed but these present day Islamic Mullahs give loud Azan on loudspeakers five times a day in the \" RAAG \"(Song) sound by using blaring loud speakers. Abu Amir Abdul Asamai, a distinguished Arabian bard who was the poet Laureate of Harun-al-Rashidís court has compiled and edited the anthology. The first modern edition of Sayar-ul- Okul Anthology was printed and published in Berlin in A.D. 1864. A subsequent edition was published in Beirut in A.D. 1932. This work is regarded as the most important and authoritative anthology of ancient Arabic poetry. It throws considerable light on the social life, customs, manners and entertainment forms in ancient Arabia. The book also contains an elaborate description of the ancient Mecca shrine, the town and the annual fair known as OKAJ which used to be held there every year. The annual Haj of the Muslims to the Kaaba is only a continuation of the old fair and not a new practice. But the OKAJ fair was far from a carnival. It provided a forum for the elite and learned to discuss the social, religious, moral-political, literary and other aspects of the Vedic culture then pervading Arabia. Sayar-ul-Okul asserts that the conclusions reached at those discussions were widely respected throughout Arabia. Mecca, therefore, followed the Varanasi (Jesus went to worship Lord Shiv in Varanasi , India) tradition of providing a seat for important discussions among the learned while the masses congregated there for knowledge and spiritual blissful life. The principal shrines at both Varanasi in India and at Mecca in Arvasthan were Shiv temples. Even to this"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"Hrsikes Das Mitriya 130 day, the central object of veneration at both Mecca and Varanasi continues to be ancient Mahadev Emblem. It is the Shankar stone which Muslim pilgrims reverently touch and kiss in the Kaaba . A few miles away from Mecca is a big signboard which forbids entry to any non-Muslim in the area. This is a reminder of the days when the Shrine was stormed and captured solely for the newly established faith of Islam. The object obviously was to prevent its capture. As the pilgrim proceeds toward Mecca he is asked to shave his head and beard and to don a special sacred attire. This consists of two seamless sheets of white cloth One is to be worn round the waist and the other over the shoulders. Both these rites are remnants of the old Vedic practice of entering Hindu shrines, clean shaven and with holy seamless spotless white sheets. The main shrine in Mecca which houses the Shiv emblem is known as the Kaaba. It is clothed in a black shroud. This custom had also originated from the days when it was thought necessary to discourage its recapture. According to Encyclopedia Britannica and Islamia , the Kaaba had 360 images. Traditional accounts mention that one of the deities among the 360 images destroyed, when the shrine was stormed, was that of Saturn, another was the moon and yet another one called Allah. In India, the practice of Navagraha Puja that is worship of the nine planets is still in vogue. Two of these nine are the Saturn and the moon. Besides, the moon is always associated with Lord Shankar. A Crescent is always painted across the forehead of the Shiv emblem. Since the presiding deity at the Kaaba shrine was Lord Shiv , i.e., Shankar the crescent was also painted on it. It is that crescent which is now adopted as a religious symbol of Islam. Another Hindu tradition is that wherever there is a Shiv shrine the sacred stream of Ganga that is the Ganges must also coexist. True to that tradition a sacred fount exists near the Kaaba . Its water is held sacred because it was regarded as but another Ganga since pre- Islamic times.

Hindu invariably perambulate is still meticulously observed. Allah is a Sanskrit word. In Sanskrit Allah, Akka and Amba are synonymous. They signify a goddess or mother. The term Allah appears in Sanskrit chants while invoking goddess Durga , i.e., Bhavani. The Islamic word Allah for God is therefore not an innovation but the ancient Sanskrit appellation retained and continued to be used by Islam. The seven perambulations too are significant. At Hindu wedding ceremonies the bride and bridegroom go round the sacred fire seven times. The practice of seven perambulations around the Kaaba shrine in Mecca is, therefore, a Hindu Vedic custom. It is also a proof that Mecca was Makha or the shrine of sacred fire around which worshipers made seven perambulations. Later, I will discuss a pan-Arabic poetic symposium which used to beheld in Mecca at the annual Okaj fair before the storming of the Kaaba by prophet Mohammedís forces. These Islamic forces went forward for vast destruction throughout this globe under the name of Allahís sword. In Vedic culture, we find King Kans killed seven of his own sistersí children. He had ordered to kill the entire infant population just to make sure that no one is ever born to destroy this evil king. King Hiranyakakasipyu considered himself as the God, and did similar activities as were done by Jehovah God of the Bible. God Krishn annihilated such miscreants. God Krishn never spoke such words that it was all right - what King Ravan, Kans, and Hiranyakakasipu did in the eyes of the Lord. IT IS ABSOLUTELY IMPORTANT FOR THE SOULS TO KNOW THE CLEAR DISTINCTION ON THE SUBJECT OF THE SCIENCE OF SELF REALIZATION FOR BETTER AND HIGHER SPIRITUAL GROWTH. Vedas and its followers have condemned such rascals and each year celebrates their annihilation by God Himself.

They believe in an eternal hell and in a devil/Satan. According to the Vedic followers, they have well understood that every movement of each atom is of Godís benevolent action and we strive to see God everywhere. We speak of oneís own activities which make one either low class (demoniac in nature) or godly (divine in nature). According to Vedic culture: Jehovahís, Davidís, Mosesí, Mohammedís, Kansí, Hiranyakakasipuís acts are considered very dangerous, heinous.

These informations will be discussed in the end for the \"Solution\" to make this world a better place to live. In America, almost every marriage ends up in divorce, and most good Christiansí women lie with several men before picking up a suitable bridegroom. American laws protect the lives of children and women regardless of caste and creed but God Jehovahís instructions to Moses - Allow the killings of children and women. So American judges, whose faiths are based on the Bible, are normally confused whether to protect the State laws or protect the Bible laws. The police officer arrests the bums all day long. Same police officer is well confused when he listens to the preachers/pastors/ministers during Church services, glorifying and justifying the activities of Jehovah and David type of Christ. Every Sunday the Church serves nice and tender bull, a baby cow (veal) or cow as a barbecue, a special feast for attracting more members. Thereby the sufferings of birth, disease, old age, and death caused by such barbaric activities become more and more intensified. State and federal laws require to arrest those whose actions like \"Christ type David\" but a church going police officer finds such teachings as the words of God. So the officer is confused and eventually he jumps from the top of the roof for unable to make head or tail. Isnít it a very big confusion? Same thing with the judges, medical doctors, and scientists who continue to be attached to the inconsistent, illogical Biblical teachings even after gaining the consistent high education.

When it comes to sin, they simply want to lump on Jesus, the babysitter or care taker of the sins, or their play/bouncing toy for their fun, game and anarchistís behavior. To illustrate what has been stated about the Biblical conception of God and His son, here are some extracts from a religious discussion which Mahatma Gandhi held with a hot Gospeler-Lady Emily belonging to England, aged about 86 years. This was published in the Harijan Weekly dated August 4, 1940. The discussion took place at Savagram, Wardh, Madhya Pradesh, India on July 27, 1940 and was reproduced in Christian Missioní published by Navajivan Trust Ahmedabad P. 212 to 217. Lady Emily ñ Jesus Christ was the Son of God. Mahatma Gandhi ñ And so are we. No, protested Lady Emily. \"He was the only Son of God.\" Gandhiji ñ The mother (she) and son (Gandhi) must differ. \"With you Jesus was the only begotten son of God.

That gave Lady Emily the cue for her sermon. \"Yes, that is where I think you are wrong. If you accepted Christ in your heart and appealed to your people to do like wise, you could deliver your message with greater ease and far better effect. He (Christ) is our salvation and without receiving Him in our hearts, we cannot be saved\", she added. Gandhiji ñ So those who accept the Christ, are all saved. They need do nothing more? \"We are sinners all\", said Lady Emily and we have but to accept Him to be saved. \"And then may continue to be sinners.\" \"Is that what you mean?\" Asked Gandhiji laughing heartily. So one can well see the contradiction stated in such type of societies. We can well analyze the above conversation as below: Q1 - If he saved you, how can you continue to be a sinner? Q2 - If he is a savior and you have accepted him as your savior, naturally you do not need to do any thing except to stay at home. What is the sense in going to repent your past/present sins in front of a priest in order to wash them off from your back?

THIS SYSTEM WAS LATER ADOPTED BY MOSLEMS. The Jewish Kosher or Moslemís Halal where killings of animals are the same. According to both traditions, animals are bled to death by cutting slowly their throats while fully conscious. These activities have developed into their \"no mercy\", \"crude\" nature. According to the Koran, it is the duty of Moslems to continue to wage war(s) against non- Moslems whom they call them Infidels (Jews, Christians, Buddhists, Hindus, and others). The Koranís injunctions of looted property which includes women and children and those men that for some reason or the other were not killed in raids against the civilians and were taken as captives. Please note that these are the instructions of Allah of the Koran. In other words, the book of Koran is teaching them to do such activities. Such men, women and children were classed as slaves. The slaves are considered as merchandise that can be sold, maltreated or killed without compunction with or without valid reason, by the followers of Islam. Like in the case of Somnath Temple of Gujarat where more than 60,000 Gujarati Hindu women were taken as concubines by the Islamic attackers. These Gujarati women were then sold in Arabia for Sex-slaves. The Koran states, as follows: \"Allah promiseth you much booty that ye will capture, and hath given you this in advance, and hath withheld manís hands from you, that it may be taken for the believers, and that he may guide you on the right path. And other (gain), which ye have not been able to achieve. Allah will compass it. Allah is able to do all things\". ... XLIX/20-21. \"O Prophet: Exhort the believers to fight.

In other words, rape, arson, loot, and murder of the innocent civilians throughout this wide world is further added due to Allahís Koranic teachings in the last 1400 years. These Moslems from the Middle East and Turkey walked into the civilian populations of Aryavart nation and kidnaped women and children. The kings became helpless due to their evil tactics. They could not fight because these Islamic wolves were holding the women and children hostages in Vedic templesí compounds. Many Hindu women were raped inside the templesí compounds by the Moslem intruders while offering services. ' The Koran and The Kafirí (Islam and the Infidel) list all the Islamic barbaric methods of murdering civilian population throughout this globe. The year was 629 A.D. and in exactly the same manner, the Jews of Khaybar were decimated and their women and children enslaved. The barbaric massacres of Christian Armenians by the Moslem Turks that started in 1894 and culminated in the decimation of Armenian population of Turkey during World War I are the part of the Koranís teachings called Jihad.

SODOMY AMONG THE BELIEVERS: The Koran tells us of boys graced with eternal youth who will attend faithful in paradise. The practice of sodomy is frowned upon in the Koran if the act takes place between two Moslems. There is nothing mentioned about a Moslem sodomizing nonbelievers. During the Napoleonic war in Egypt, Marshall Jaubert wrote to General Bruix that the Arabs and the Mamelukes have used some of our men captured by them for Sodomy. It was a case of letting them do it or die. After the Islamic invasion of many parts of Europe, the Islamic army went after the Christian European boys for sodomizing them. Many European travelers and Christian Missionaries, unfamiliar with sodomite propensities of many Moslems, suffered sexual molestation in Persia in the hands of even government officials. Sheik Nasr, the Governor of Bushire, once said to an English missionary: \"I stopped a caravan of Jews bound for Afghanistan, penetrating all forty of their females in one night. They protested that such action as an outrage, but I said the outrage was justified in that all of their offspring would be Moslems.\" ATTACK ON THE US EMBASSY IN PAKISTAN The diabolic nature of the attack on the US Embassy became apparent after the fact. Some Moslems had attacked the holy shrine at Mecca and this enraged the Moslems of Pakistan against all non-Moslems. They just assumed that the attack was organized by the Americans.

Moslems of the Middle-east had great hand in supplying the black slaves of Africa to the United States of America. Many black Moslems have sprung- out in the United States to avenge the mistreatment to their ancestors by the white Christian owners. But the Afro- Americans must realize that the Moslems were also the cause of their forefatherís sufferings. According to Allah of the Koran, slaves captured in war automatically became the property of the Victor. Just like any property, they could be sold or transferred. The owner has every right over the body and soul of his slave men and women. In Islamic countries slavery was practiced as late as only a few years ago. It was a flourishing trade. Christian and Jewish women were prized items. African slaves were good for labor. Many were castrated (although castration of Moslems is banned in Islam) and employed as eunuchs in the harems. The slave market of Mecca, located very near the shrines of Kaaba, was closed down very recently due to the pressure of public opinion abroad. The Armenian had been massacred many times by the Turks in unspeakable butcheries. The survivors were taken as prisoners and sold in the slave markets of Aleppo. These captives were stripped naked, both men and women, lashed with whips and forced to run before the horses. Those who fell behind were stabbed to death on the way and the roads were covered with Armenian dead bodies."},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"The Ultimate Guide for One World Order 153 Female slaves or concubines were kept in the haremsí for sexual gratification. The codes of conduct of a Moslem vis-a- vis a woman that we often hear about, are really meant for Moslem women and absolutely have nothing to do with a Moslemís behavior with an infidelís wife or mother. Infidel women are beyond the limits set by the Koran. In Islamic societies even a wedded wife is treated as a personal property comparable to gold, silver and land. They are veiled and hidden from public view if they happen to be wives. But the concubines are circulated as gifts among the friends. The afternoon siestas of the Sheikhs of Arab countries and their sexual escapades with slave women or concubines, are common knowledge. If the master, for whatever reason, takes the life of slave or maims his or her for life, there is no one to question him for the laws of Islam, the 'Shariaí, have given the believer unlimited right over the person of the slave. The Chapter on the Koran and Moslem women gives as us some idea and Islamís injunctions on Moslem women. They should cover their bodies from head to foot. Khomeiniís Iran forced these women to go under the ' chadorí . They must not go outside to work where other men might see them. They may not be rulers or judges in an Islamic State. But such regulations are valid for Moslem women only. The non-Moslems are to be handled differently, as the Islamic codes are not binding on them. 'The infidel women are considered to be the property of Moslems; they are their slavesí and the wife or daughter of a ' zimmií can be molested by a Moslem with impunity in a Moslem state ruled by the ' Shariaí or Islamic jurisprudence. The idea comes from the treatment meted out to infidel women who were captured in the battlefield. The first fifth of all booty went to the prophet or the caliph or whoever happened to hold the position of the ' amir-ul-mominin'. It could be the Moslem king of the land or even a petty chieftain. This so-called leader examinedí all booty, inspected and sometimes feltí by touching it. The women, all of them were paraded in front of the leader, naked or scantily clad, so that the leader could make his choice."},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"Hrsikes Das Mitriya 154 These women were NOT brought in front of the ' amir-ul- momininí dressed in ' chadorsí . It was thus that the prophet Mohammed himself used to inspect his captives and chose Rehana and Juwairiya, both Jewish women whose male relatives were all killed by the Moslems. Juwairiya eventually gave up her religion and married the prophet and became one of the ten or eleven wives of his harem. Rehana did not give up Jewish faith and so was turned into a concubine of the prophet. She thus took her place on the side of Mary, another slave woman, and a Christian, who after Khadija gave birth to a male child, fathered by the prophet Mohammed. Although the number of legal wives for Moslems is limited to four, there is no limit to the number of concubines a faithful servant of Allah could have. The practice eventually gave rise to immense seraglios or haremsí in Islamic lands. IN INDIA THE CAPTIVE WOMEN OF THE VEDIC FOLLOWERS WERE INSPECTED BY THE MOSLEM KINGS IN WOMENíS MARKETS CALLED MINA BAZAARS (MARKETS OF PEARLS) WHERE NO MALES OTHER THAN THE KING AND HIS PALS WERE ALLOWED ENTRY.

In the last 30 years, Americans and the rest of the world are exposed to the Koranic Jihad methods more so than ever before.

Therefore, it is the responsibility of each government to protect the defenseless innocent citizens. Animals are born in the same land like any other human. So they are equal citizens of that particular land. If the government does not protect their murders from the hands of the criminals, the government is also a culprit in spreading barbaric acts in todayís Modern Society.

The large number of animalsí murders is leading into intense humansí sufferings and murders in various ways . . . \" CAUSE AND EFFECT\". Allah demanded Ibrahim and His followers to sacrifice the most dear thing to please Allah. . So Ibrahim, instead of sacrificing himself, tried to sacrifice his son.

Anyone with some sense can understand that the most dear and the most valuable thing in oneís life is oneís own life. When one is driving, walking, or doing anything, who does he protect the most? Self or the dog! The Koranic people are doing Halal of the speechless and defenseless cows and other animals. The cow did not make such conditions that somebody cuts her throat, and the one who cuts her throat receives Allahís heaven. What a nice Proposition!

If the Moslem follower is in so much in material sense gratification, his life has to be the most dear to him otherwise he would be respecting other lives. It simply concludes that the Islamic men have been cheating Allah for the last 1400 years. Allah asked for the most dear sacrifice, instead of fattening themselves to be put to Moslem Halal , they have been betraying Allah by sacrificing poor cows and other animals. You can very well see the clear cut cheating propensities and specially to their own Allah who according to the Koran is forgiving, and merciful. What a shame! The Moslems have been fattening the cows and other animals for their, the so-called, sacred months for the last 1,400 years. If they are really faithful and truly believe in the Koranic injunctions, they must then offer themselves for their own Halal rites on the day of Eid-Al-Adha, an Islamic ceremony of cutting animals for Allahís sacrifice. This way, they wonít cheat Allah anymore. LET THEIR WIVES CUT THE THROATS OF SUCH SEXUAL ORIENTED HUSBANDS - PLEASE NO TRANQUILIZER, LET HIM BLEED TO DEATH, ALLAH IS FORGIVING AND MERCIFUL.

Polygamy is allowed to Moslems in India not to any other person belonging to different religions. Since they have been allowed to enjoy four marriages and produce unlimited offsprings, it is time that they follow their own \"TRUE HALAL\" rites through the help of their wives who they divorce like animals by simply uttering the word ' Talaq, Talaq, Talaqí - three times, and the wife is thrown out like a piece of garbage.

Maharaj is paid a large sum of money by Christian pastors/ministers/and their whole gang. He is entertained with different methods which are not allowed in Vedic literature. Vedas say: \"Control your desires, like: no-illicit sex, no- intoxication, no-gambling, and no-fish, meat or egg.\" But Rabi Maharaj is looking for fun for cheap bodily pleasures so he has to condemn Vedic texts. He finds an easy answer like Jimmy Swaggart, Jimmy Baker type in the Holy book of the Bible. They have sold more than three million copies of this book.

HERE WHAT GOES IN A SLAUGHTER HOUSE: Each cow going through several rows in a slaughter house, comes one by one in front, to face her terrible end in the hands of expert butchers. While standing in the rows (like Americans GIs during the Army draft), some cows want to get out from the most inhumane scenes. By looking at them, one can very easily conclude that these cows are going through great fear of death C just like any human faces similar pain and suffering while cutting his/her throat. Their eyes are full of tears seeing the murder of their fellow cows. Their gaits (walk) become heavier. Cows and other animals have spirit-souls and they can very well sense any of their future outcome. Out of fear of death, many cowsí blood becomes poisonous After cow reaches the front row, the butcher hits her on the head with an electric sledge hammer device. Within moments of such a powerful strike, the cow becomes unconscious and then the butcher inserts a hook kind of metal device on her back leg and lift the poor unconscious cow in the air through automatic hydraulic system. These cows and bulls try to get out from this untimely fate from the hands of the expert butchers (absolutely like the Jews and Polish went through gas-chambers under the supervision of Nazisí guards B the guards kept them in straight line). Same thing - No different. Cause and Effect and nothing else! The unconscious cow (like many human become unconscious after"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"Hrsikes Das Mitriya 172 automobile accidents), out of severe pain, tries to release herself from the metal hook stuck on the rear leg. In order to release herself, she raises her entire body upward almost touching the front legs with the rear legs and this process goes on several times until the entire bodyís blood accumulates on her throat. The butcher lowers her down (still not dead), takes the sharp long knife and cut her throat. The pool of blood which is collected on the throat falls in a bucket just like changing the automobile oil. If she is an 'ití then we must analyze the following before we lump a life into a rock/stone? 1) Why does she has red blood? 2) Why does she need to be murdered like any human? 3) Why does she protest for getting killed? 4) Why does she have tears before her fate? 5) Do you find the apples, oranges, mangoes, or any other fruits, or vegetables protest? The fruits are simply given to us by nature. As soon as they are ripened, one does not have to pluck them - they fall by themselves. We do not have to kill the trees in order to get the apples or oranges. When you drank your motherís milk during infancy, did you kill your mother later? Similarly, when you drink cowsí milk, you do not kill her because this is by the arrangement of God Krishn that you got cows who simply eat grass, growing wild in the pasture and in turn gives you plenty of milk. What a nice proposition! Even your mother cannot offer such a beautiful proposition on a continuous basis. So by the laws of nature a cow is everybodyís mother. Believe it or not, but the truth cannot be changed as without them an infant cannot go through further transition in humanís life of youth.

Once I was traveling by an automobile from Calcutta to the airport when, all of a sudden the driver brought the car to a halt; seeing a large herd of cows and buffalos coming from opposite direction.

I wanted the driver to stop the car to protest with the herdsmen for taking them to the slaughter house. Due to trafficís noise, the driver had already sped far away before he could pay attention to my words.

If today, humans come to know that the planet earth is the heaven, they will immediately give up the worship of God thinking they are now free and clear but it is not so. Somewhere in the subconscious state of mind it reminds the soul to free out from the material bondage of pains and sufferings. Most of the humans are worshiping only for one reason to release them from such material bondage to attain the final kingdom of God for permanent peace and happiness. This is one of the reasons for Godís worship. Since all material planets are associated with miseries of birth, disease, old age, and death, all souls, desiring permanent happiness, trying their ways to win the side of the Almighty to restore back to permanent home.

When you see the reflection, you will find out that the roots of the Pippals tree are upward and branches downward. So this material world is a reflection of the spiritual world, just as the reflection of the tree from the bank is seen to be upside down. This material world is a shadow. In a shadow there cannot be any substance, yet we can understand from the shadow that there is a substance. In the reflection of a spiritual world there is no happiness, but in the spiritual world itself there is real happiness. No one can enter into the spiritual kingdom as long as he is trying to be the lord over material nature. The spiritual world (an eternal kingdom) which is three fourths of the entire God Krishn ís abode is non-destructible. The eternal kingdom can be approached by those who are not bewildered or attracted by this material world. Our senses are limited.

Whatever, infinitesimal study of few planets had been done so far have turned out to be unbearable expenditure on the cost of human life. What to talk of spiritual planets, we are yet unable to study a fraction of a fraction of our immediate material universe in todayís time. According to Vedic texts, the material universes consist of only one fourth of the entire Kingdom of Lord Krishn . Besides, there are innumerable material universes. Vedic literature gives us complete information of many worlds that exist there and as well as about spiritual kingdom. But one must always hanker after the spiritual sky and the Supreme Kingdom. When one reaches the Supreme Kingdom, he does not have to return to the material world. Our soul is anti-matter, spiritual.

Would he understand them or make any sense without a teacherís guidance? Naturally, one has to be guided under a trained learned teacher(s). Similarly, he must surrender unto the learned teachers for a proper guidance who have known the ultimate truth. The disciples mustnít be boastful or egoist while rendering service(s) to such great souls and any inquiry must be made in very submissive manners otherwise the student will remain in the mode of darkness. When Sanatan Gosvami asked Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu about the real constitution of the living being, Sri Caitanya replied that the real constitution of the entity is to render service to the God with full understanding. Let us understand this 'Eternal Religioní from Sanskrit meaning ' Dharmí . Dhr means 'to sustainí. Therefore, dharm is that quality which is unchangeable and cannot be taken away. When we talk about fire, we know very well that the heat and light will be there otherwise we cannot call it a fire. A particular religious faith may be because of beginning in the history of human society, but the Sanatan Dharm (Eternal Religion) lies outside of history for it belongs to the living beings (soul), who have no birth and who never die, who continue to live after the destruction of the material body, just as they live before present bodyís formation. In our daily lives we can very well see that every one of us serving someone or the other. An animal serves man, a friend serves his friend, a mother serves her child, a husband serves a wife, politicians convince the voters of their ability to serve the people, the businessmen serve the consumers. This simply shows that we are involved in some capacity or the other to render service to each other.

THE CHILDREN OF IRAQ, BEFORE THE REST OF THE NATION, REFUSE THAT WE BEG FOR THE MILK WHICH THEY NEED FROM THE INFIDELS AND SHAMELESS\". Even the Moslem children can die without receiving milk from HINDU HOLY MOTHER COW. Christian fundamentalists and news media have been making fun of the word Holyí cow. But they are holy and they are mothers to all lives. There is a period during infancy when a child does not get milk or not enough from her mamaís breasts and is unable to chew the hard food. This time each child is raised on holy mother-cowís milk. SO THE COWS ARE NOT ONLY HOLY TO HINDUS BUT THEY ARE HOLY TO ALL THE CHILDREN AND GROWNUP. Today, Moslem children can die if the holy mother-cowís milk does not reach Iraq. So mother cows are very important and those who are used to making fun and insulting mother cows are slapping their own roots. They are the real shameless disguise to the human society. The same Moslem children, once they grow up, do the Islamic Halal of their Holy Mother Cows - same as Jews Kosher. In other words bleed them to death. Is this really a compassion or any kind of mercy? Could children, in Iraq, eat diamonds worth billions of dollars in humanís assessment? Could they drink present day black gold (oil)?

It is between fifty and sixty years that since I read the Apocalypse (Revelation), and then considered it merely the ravings of a manic what has no meaning admits of no explanation He is also one of the founders of USA. The present day followers of the Bible have changed in many of their rituals. Orthodox Greeks burned live ox, cow, ram, goat, or pig as a burnt offering to God on Church-altar while incenses are burned in Vedic and Buddhists temples. In general we found that the Bible followers were so sticky in their beliefs that majority of them would not buy stick incense even today because it interfered in their beliefs. From the Christianity point of view, burning of incense on church-altar is considered heathensí work and such teachings have continued to be retained by the sticky followers in their subconscious minds from 'father to soní type beliefs. Though this practice is eliminated from many churches but the thinking of incense burning is not very well accepted. WHY WOMEN OF INDIA PUT RED MARKING(S) ON THEIR FOREHEADS? The Bible believers always have strange ideas of Vedic customs. This custom is the single most important to protect the married women from the clutches of 'hungry-wolvesí. Married women put on the red marking as an identification sign that she is married - just like wearing the wedding ring. This itself is the best psychology for the 'hungry-wolvesí to keep them off the back of married women and thereby saving lots of pain."},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"The Ultimate Guide for One World Order 189 Anyone, will agree that the red marking on the forehead is immediately visible than a tiny ring. The red-marking works like a stop-red light. This immediately warns the man, approaching with wrong ideas, that she is a married woman. Many women are very expert in painting the lips and cheeks with lipstick which has no significance. Red markings on womení forehead can save many marriages here in the Western world. Today, in the Western world almost everyoneís wife is somebodyís wife. The sons say in America, 'My motherís husband (who is not the real father) is a very nice guy'. This is happening due to the influence of contradictory teachings of the Bible. Some of, the so-called, named Hindus are following in their footsteps. By following the examples of the two most heinous books, the Bible and the Koran, the whole world society would turn into, in the real sense, 'Bastards and Bitchesí. When the society is raised without love, the hate breeds in. Children do not get proper love from parents. They doubt everything when these children grow older. They have no faith, no trust on anyone. Most of them are abused by their demanding parents. Most of the parents themselves are vulgar. Children in Western countries are put in the foster-homes. Recently the foster-parents had abused many children here in the USA. They continue to tackle these emotional problems through the Christiansí Bible which has no love, no definite answers. Contrary, it leads them to do many such horrible acts after reading the horrible passages of the Bible before going to sleep. In subconscious minds, children are registering such inhumane acts and later they bring them into practice. HERE IS AN EXAMPLE OF NO TRUST: One Christian was told, Krishn is God. He said: \"I never heard that Krishn could be the God of all\". He said further that he read in a Western encyclopedia that Krishn , was an Indian (Hindu) idol God.

STARTLING FACTS: The Bible is one of twenty-seven books for which divine origin is claimed. Christians deny the divinity of all Bibles but their own. We deny the divinity of only one more than they do. Out of 250 Jewish-Christian writings, sixty-six have arbitrarily been declared canonical by Protestants. The rejected books are of the same general character as those now published together as The \"Holy Bible\". Circumstances rather than merit determined selection. For 150 years the Christian Bible consisted of the sacred books of the Jews. The New Testament was not formed until the latter half of the second century, when Irenaeus selected twenty books from among forty or more gospels, nearly as many acts of apostles, a score of revelations and a hundred epistles. Why were these particular books, were chosen? Why four gospels instead of one? Irenaeus: \"There are four quarters of the earth in which we live and four universal winds\". The Gospels were unknown to Peter, Paul, and the early Church Fathers. They were forged later. The Bible did not assume anything like its present form until the fourth century. The Roman Catholic, Greek Catholic, and Protestant canons were not adopted until modern times. The Bible was recognized as a collection of independent writings. The Council of Trent (1563) determined the Roman Catholic canon, consisting of seventy-two books. The Romanists anathematize the Protestant Bible, and the Protestants denounce the Catholic Bible as a popish imposture. The Greek Catholics at the Council of Jerusalem in 1672 finally accepted Revelation. Their Bible contains several books not in the Roman canon. The Westminister Assembly in 1647 approved the list of sixty-six books composing the Authorized Version, the one most used in"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"Hrsikes Das Mitriya 194 America. Adoption was by a majority vote: None of the men contributing most to form the canon accepted all these books. Chrysostoma, who named the Bible, rejected six of the sixty-six- Esther, Jonah, Hebrews, James, Jude, and Revelation. Calvin excluded Revelation as unintelligible. George Smith of the British Museum unearthed Assyrian terra-cotta tablets older than the Books of Moses, which give accounts of the Creation, the Temptation, the Tower of Bable, and the flood virtually identical with the Genesis accounts. The Babylonian first man was named Adami. Adam and Eve are not referred to again in the Old Testament. PENTATEUCH: The so-called Books of Moses were not written by Moses. Their language did not exist in his age. They record his death and burial (Deut. 34:5-6) and refer to persons of a later date Gen. 36:31:32. A life of Washington naming Lincoln cannot be by Washington. For forty-two proofs that Moses did not write these five books, see The Bible by Ramsburg. They were produced centuries later, and are of composite character, being compelled after the Babylonian captivity from four sources. The internal evidence of later origin is irrefutable. Telltale phrases and thoughts occur throughout. Hikiahís \"finding\" of these books (2 Kings 22:8) was a pious fraud. The Higher Critics have won. Their victory makes the Fall of Man a fiction and Atonement an absurdity. It is time to tell these priests, pastors, minister, missionaries, mullahs and their supporters that they are the Number 1 enemies to the entire universe and their influence to the world society is the root cause of hate, world war and intense hellish conditions.

What Jesus Christ told his disciples is altogether a different thing though it would shake out of stupor many a non-Christian. Jesus said: \"Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth?

So with this mentality, what is the next destination for the soul? In the body of a wolf! It is a well-known fact that many of his disciples were fishermen. Jesus never asked them to turn their back upon that sinful profession involving harm and injury to defenseless creatures, but on several occasions helped them to catch large number of fish by exercising his strange miraculous powers.

On such calculations, just to have a billion (not billions, not trillions) planets, their existence must have started at lest 10 million years ago or before. To create one trillion planets, Jehovah God must take at least ten billion years based on the Biblical approach. So it proves beyond any doubt that the Bible science is a serious contradiction to any human logic/ Vedic science/or modern science. According to Vedas : There are innumerable planets in the Brahmajyoti, jut as there are in the material sky, but all these planets are spiritual, not material. God Krishn says that in the material universe(s) like ours, we must suffer from the basic miseries of birth, disease, old age and death from the lowest to the highest. Bhagavad Gita explains about the various planets and also the presence of life in these planets. Regardless of the highest to the lowest planets within the material universe(s), God Krishn very clearly warns us the various sufferings associated in these miserable places. So His advice is to come hack to the Real Home rather than flickering from one place to another. EXAMPLE: Two coeternal spirits reside side by side like two friendly birds sitting on the same branch of a tree. One bird is watching the other birdís movements. Sometimes this bird, which is being watched, flies from one branch to another, sometimes whops here and whops there. This watching bird is simply waiting for this birdís return. But this flopping bird is"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"The Ultimate Guide for One World Order 207 simply busy in enjoying the taste of various fruits on the tree that is to feel pleasures or pains while the 'Watching Birdí is not subject to these material joys and sorrows. This 'Watching Birdí is like an Infinite Soul or God Krishn and this flopping bird is like a finite soul, or you (infinitesimal soul). So you can well see that you are the cause of your sufferings or happiness. So you have the power to control your situations from bad to good or revert back to lower type of life. Though one may derive material pleasures by going to a night club and get intoxicated but one can feel the material suffering due to a serious hang over associated thereafter. So one can very well conclude that these hankering material pleasures are not permanent. One who is constantly seeking for such temporary pleasures of this never ending cycle, will certainly get deeper into intense miseries here or hereafter. There may be momentarily happiness. That is it! Just like the moon reflects the light of the sun, similarly the sun reflects Brahmajyoti ( Krishnís energy). With the help of the moonís soothing reflection, we can grow nice fruits, flowers and grains. These are well explained in Vedic texts. Anyone, can reach God through the help of sound vibration syllable AUM - it is resounded on a regular basis in YOGA posture position. One will definitely attain the Kingdom of God. The rascals changed this sound vibration to a simple material word \"AMEN\", as discussed before. Earlier, I had quoted from the World Book Encyclopedia: \"OM is a sacred syllable in the Sanskrit language, similar in meaning to the English \"amen\". It might well be translated, So it shall be . . .\" What does demonís writings reflect? \"Arrogance, nothing but arrogance!\" So it shall be. WHY IT SHALL BE? Why should you recite such word (amen) which has no potency, no deep understanding, no effect. If you call someone with an incorrect name, like calling Mickey - Monkey, how would he react? Naturally, you will be offending Mickey. Similarly, Christians are mispronouncing the syllable OM (AUM) and thereby blaspheming the name of God. Therefore, Christians must use the correct syllable OM in order to have positive effects."},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"Hrsikes Das Mitriya 208 Besides, \"Amen\" sounds like a-man, as often spoken by bums, street people, winos - specially in New York and Chicago - like this \"A-man, do you have a quarter?\" Does it not give a cheap association? If, YOU ARE EMOTIONALLY INVOLVED, THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO HELP - KEEP ON CALLING MICKEY, MONEY AND KEEP ON OFFENDING MICKEY MORE AND MORE - NO HELP TO THE RIGID - AS IS THE PRESENT SITUATION RIGHT HERE IN AMERICA. DRUG PROBLEM, CHILD ABUSE ETC. . . . ALSO FROM VEDIC TEXTS, WE FIND THAT THE NAME OF GOD IS THE SOUND SYLLABLE OM (AUM). IN CHAPTER 9, VERSE 17 OF BHAGAVAD GITA C GOD KRISHN SPEAKS: \"I AM THE FATHER, MOTHER, MAINTAINER, AND GRANDSIRE OF ALL THIS UNIVERSE. I AM WHAT IS TO BE KNOWN, I AM PURITY, AND I AM THE SYLLABLE OM\" THE BRIEF INTERPRETATION OF THE SACRED SYLLABLE AUM (OM): The sacred syllable Aum, composed of three letters, a, u and m, is the greatest of all the Names of God, for, it connotes the significations of all the other Names of God. For example, take the first letter entering in the make-up of the syllable, a. This means, (1) Virat, \"Perfectly Resplendent\", which as applied to God indicates that He is the illuminator of the multifarious universe(s). (2) Agni, \"Self-Effulgent\", \"Foremost\", etc. . . . that is, He possesses true knowledge by His very nature everywhere (3) Visvah; \"Abode\", or \"Habitat\", that is, in God the whole universe(s) has its residence, so to say, and He also has His access to every part of the universe(s). The second component of the sacred Syllable, u, means:"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"The Ultimate Guide for One World Order 209 (1) Hirnyagaarbha having the sun(s) and other lustrous heavenly bodies in His 'graspí, and Who is the Maker of all these lustrous planets. The synonyms of jyotih: 'lightí are Hiranyam, Amritam and Kirti . . . (2) Vayuh: 'Impellerí, 'propellerí, for He has infinite powers, and He is the Supporter of the universe(s) (3) Taijasah: 'Source of the whole mass of lusterí, for He is Lustrous by His very nature and the Illuminator of the entire universe(s) and every being in them. The last component of this Syllable, m, means, (1) Isvarah; 'Almighty Godí, as He is the Creator of the entire universe(s), the All-Powerful Master of all, and Maker of Justice. (2) Adityah: the Imperishable. (3) Prajna, Whose nature itself is right knowledge, and who is OMNISCIENT, OMNIPOTENT, OMNIPRESENT. In essence, Christians have been using the distorted pronunciation of \" AUM\" as \"AMEN\" - which actually boils down to that they have been, unknowingly, calling the name of God Krishn for the last 1,900 years. THEY MUST UNDERSTAND THAT THE MAKER OF JUSTICE (OUR FATHER) CANNOT BE BUYER OF CHRISTIANSí SINS AS THEY ARE MADE TO BELIEVE THROUGH THE PASTORS, MINISTERS, PRIESTS AND THE ENTIRE GANG. Sacred Syllable OM has got many benefits. Resonance of OM in meditation, one can definitely attain God. Contrary, if you call too many times Amen to a gentleman, sounds A-man of the street people, you will be doing an offense."},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"Hrsikes Das Mitriya 210 Some scholars maintain that Vedas enjoin upon us the worship of many gods such as Agni, Mitra , etc. But they are mistaken. In as much as in Vedas . Agni, Varuna and other similar words are principally used for God alone. Agni means fire and fire burns all the garbage, dirt and cleanse the atmosphere from various diseases. So my brothers and sisters, the God is just like a fire who cleanse all the evils within us. So we can compare fire to the God but it did not mean that Agni (fire) becomes God. God can be described by many Names because of His wonderful various qualities. You can take your own example. Let us say your name is John Smith. A lot of people may be calling you by your first name John; some might have called you with a nick name; some might be calling you by addressing Mr. Smith; your mother might have called you by some affectionate name; your friends in the neighborhood might have identified you with a different name; or boss of such and such; the guy who lives on such and such address; husband of Joyce; brother of such and such; father of such and such; the guy with a mustache and so on. John Smith is an infinitesimal soul and yet he is identified and associated with so many different names. Similarly, the Almighty Father Krishn who is infinite can be identified with millions of attributes. Again I repeat that to continue with the same mentality of a frog of a tiny well will not help in the proper understanding of God Krishn ; you must expand your vision beyond the limited boundaries of a well that there is an ocean and there is even bigger ocean and so on so forth. What to talk of oceans on earth, Vedas describe about the ocean on our immediate universe, called Garbhodak Vishnu ocean nearly 2 of our immediate universe is covered with water. This book is providing the seed clue for the souls to get on the right track. You must seek for more answers from the qualified masters of Vedas . In the Rigved 10.82.3, the idea of one God is put in the following manner: \"Our Father who is the All creating God and who is the disposer, knoweth of all the worlds and all things existing; He is the name giver of all the devas - (shining objects). Him alone"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"The Ultimate Guide for One World Order 211 all other beings attain for. He is the one and only one solution of all our questions.\" In Atharva Ved 13/4/16-8 - \"He (God) is called neither the second, nor the third nor yet the fourth. He is called neither the fifth, nor the sixth, nor yet the seventh. He is called neither the eight, nor the ninth nor yet the tenth. He takes care of all that breathe and all that do not breathe. He has got all the conquering power. He is the One, One alone and only One. All these luminous forces of nature become one in Him\". It is a misconception between the meaning \" Devas\" and \" Vedic idea of one God\". It is generally translated by the Western scholars as God and 33 devas that are mentioned in some Vedic hymns, Let us suppose that Vedas teach the worship of 33 devas or gods. The word Deva is derived from the Sanskrit word Div which has got ten meanings: It means dev is used in the sense of sporting, desire to succeed, pursuit, brilliancy, praise, pleasure, exhilaration, sleep, knowledge, motion and acquisition. As such, it is an epithet applied to the sun, the moon and other forces of nature, i.e., fire, wind, etc . . . Yaskacharya, a great sage of India explains the meaning of \" dev\" as follows: \"That which confers some advantages upon us, can illuminate things, i.e., explain or throw light upon them and that which is the source of light is ' deví . It is, therefore, absolutely wrong to translate the word \" dev\" everywhere as God. It is used for all brilliant and useful objects as well as learned men of truthful nature (sages, etc.) and, therefore, must not be translated wrong.\""},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"Hrsikes Das Mitriya 212 JUST AS TWO FRIENDLY BIRDS SITTING ON THE SAME BRANCH OF A TREE, SIMILARLY, KRISHN AND THE LIVING ENTITY ARE SEATED WITHIN THE SAME BODY.

They were forced to accept Christianity and those who did not become Christians could not get jobs, admissions in schools and colleges. So these migrant Hindus under the British system had adopted Christianís names besides their familyís Hindu names. So this Rabi R.

This man talks of Vedas having fake God. We can determine God with His qualities of love, compassion, virtues, perfectness, truthfulness and many other Attributes. I have discussed them up to certain extent but for detail explanation one must read Vedic texts. When we talk about Sun, do we think that it is an Indian Sun or an American Sun? If Billy Graham organization helps in publishing this retarded book, this proves beyond any doubt that this 'fake' himself does not understand anything about God - in other words absolutely a 'phony guy' or you say \"A WOLF UNDER THE COVER OF SHEEP SKIN\". What does the sun provide us? Heat and light. SO THE INDIAN FAKE SUN DOES PROVIDE HEAT AND LIGHT ALSO. If one speaks about my American sun and Indian fake sun then there is definitely wrong with this person because this insane person does not understand the very basic law of the God that He is the one and the only one God for all, as confirmed in Vedic texts. This particular publication, ' Death of a Guru,í proves his entire loss of credibility for his, the so called, evangelist activities. The one who does not have the very basic understanding of God, is a Hypocrite. Such types are confusing the peace of the sentient beings throughout the globe for the satisfaction of false prestige. The purpose is to collect money for their useless cause. Evangelists have basic concepts on Hinduism but they do not want to reveal the top secrets of Hinduism.

So the Sun has some place to hide under this mountain.

Because of her innocent talk, cityís Sahib smiled and he, was fully taken over by her sweet innocent talks. Naturally, she could be trained at a later date. But how could you train these arrogant, the Bible thumpers and their rigid followers, in this, almost ending, 20 th century, who speak that Indian Sun (in other words, the so called, Hindu Fake God) is a fake?

British had insulted the Vedic texts, twisted Vedas , and forced the compulsory studies of the Bible in colleges and schools. They had completely discounted the very basic law of nature that is \" THE LAW OF KARMA\". In 1943 the Britisher found that the Japanese, who had already taken over Burma, were at the doors of India, approaching Bengal. By their tactic known as the denial policy, the British sank many Indian boats carrying food and destroyed large rice crops. This left local natives starving and without the boats they needed for trade. The famine that hit was the worst in Indiaís history. Prices of the food went too high and majority of people could not afford to buy food, and so they were dying in the streets of Calcutta. The Government of Churchill created an artificial famine so that Indian people out of scarcity would volunteer to become soldiers to fight with Germans for British cause. No rice was available and people were hungry. Footpaths and open spaces were congested with people, with starving children eating food from garbage. The Bible backed British tried to save those lives essential for the fight. In India, for the common people the British empireís prescription was uniform or starvation. One American gentleman who was present at that time remarked, \"People are starving in this way, if this was our country, we would have revolution but the people of India are so trained that in spite of artificial famine they did not commit theft, stealing othersí property.

No doubt that present India is also grabbed by the demonic influence of Islam and Christianity and many Hindus have started following the similar activities in the absence of literary--yet there are more than 60 percent of the Hindu population in present India who would prefer to die of starvation than kill animals for food.

That is the very basic reason that the Hindus tried to adjust according to circumstances and did not go out of their way to kill and butcher the other world societies. Christian science cannot offer this kind of situation of higher understanding. Here are several examples just in the last 200 years as given below: In USA, native Indians (women, mothers, children) were called savages, heathens and all sorts of ugly names. They were butchered by the intruding European Christians. Almost the entire population of the natives was wiped out under the pretext of dark-skin and heathens. The education was stopped for American Indians so that they could become ignorant and naturally the ignorance will make them not to fight back. They were put into confined reservations. If one is found wandering outside the limits of reservations, the government will penalize by stopping nominal subsidy. Still, they have many restrictions. The famous American movie actor, late John Wayne, titled: ìDuke of America î, considered an ëidol of heroismí by the English-speaking children and elderly Americans, often spoke in his hot cowboys-Indian movies: ìKill all the Indians and there shall not be any problem.î He was a good Christian in the eyes of specially Baptist type Christians.

Those who have joined the gang of the Bible stickers are in the same mood of hoodlums, hoarding material wealth. Jalian WALA BAGH: Most of the Sikhs were butchered. Although the British Christians want to lump their mistakes only on one person ( the maniac Christian British officer who ordered the shooting of armless civilians) but he was the product of the hateful society whose teachings were derived from British schools, colleges, and churches of England for a systematic hate toward non-Christians as being heathens and savages. Due to their hateful animalistic teaching, even such a highly civilized Vedic society was not spared from the clutches of these animal- behaved intruders. Did the Christianity, really, understand that the soul is transmigrating from childhood to youth to an old age and, similarly, at the time of death the soul transmigrates to another body? Do they, really, know that the soul is not going to stick next to the bag (dead body) of stool, fowl-flesh, lumps of bones, salvia, mucus, and all kinds of germs? And within hours of death, most of the relatives want to dispose off the material body-garment, because of creating fowl smell, within hours of soul leaving this bag of flesh and bone. If these followers of the Bible and the Koran had understood the very basic fundamental law of the universe that we are not our body but a spirit soul, they could not possibly do such bloodshed. If they understood them well, they could not possibly continue to harm others in this, the so- called, advanced age. United States of America, Canada, Australia, and other colonized part of the world have a history of massacres of natives.

The Science of the Vedas teaches only one God but over a period of years many people did what they wanted to do and did not care to go by the Vedic guidelines and brought forth the counterfeit books to satisfy their material sensual desires. For example, during Sakhya Muni (later was called Lord Buddh ) time in Bharat, many kings had defiled the Vedic texts and started eating animals. So the Great Lord Buddh appeared on this planet to refute wrong activities. Lord Krishn speaks: ìWherever and whenever there is a decline in religious practice, and a predominant rise of irreligious ñ at that time I descend Myself to deliver the pious and to annihilate the miscreants, as well as to reestablish the principles of religion, I advent Myself millennium after millennium.î ...

In order to prove the Bible point, they are working very hard to fight against the evolution science. Another Challenge to God by the Bible Creationist, ìSATAN OR DEVILî INVENTION: Since they do not want to change themselves and are interested in all sorts of fun, they have manufactured their own theory that because of Satan, the problems have been created. This Satan is a bigger savior than Jesus Christ since the Satan is utilized as a plea-bargain in solving hard core criminals. Satan is used as a great influence by the Christian priests to get the murderers out of jail in the name of ìBORN AGAIN CHRISTIANî. In other words, Satan/Devil is their ìSaviorî. This also means that there are two ìSaviorsî for Christians. One is an automatic Savior no matter what filth they live with unlimited sense-gratifications. By this belief, they are convinced of their automatic salvation. Second Savior is stronger than this automatic Savior, i.e., THE SATAN or THE DEVIL ó This Satan does a miraculous job in releasing the hard line culprits like murderers, rapists etc. They all will go with candle lights outside penitentiaries for demanding the murderers not to be hanged under the name of Jesus Christ since the Satan incited the murder.

As discussed earlier that by the existence of immortal and eternal souls knowledge, and applying the laws of Karma in oneís life, one can and will solve the problem of oneís evil nature without making God or His rival Satan responsible for creating hate, unwanted population. So change first yourself and surrender fully to God Krishn with open heart and mind without any reservations, without any preconceived ideas and he will definitely in turn give you the True Love. God Krishn speaks in Bhagavad Gita: ìGive up all varieties of religion and surrender unto Me, I will protect My devotees from all sorts of evilsî . . . Bhagavad Gita 18:66. Evil is developed by oneís own individual propensities and such evil thought can be destroyed by God Krishnís mercy alone. It is ridiculous and absurd to believe that the Almighty God can have a rival in the form of a Devil or Satan. The Bible pushes this idea: ìIt is the devil or Satan that prompts human to do evil or sin. From Vedas , we find that Devil (demoniac-mentality) is nothing but the evil propensities of a person born out of ignorance and selfishness etc. The same very people want to have all sorts of fun on the risk of others. During their fun they do not make the devil responsible or share in their fun. If someone interferes in oneís fun, he would be shot-dead. The preacher would approach the murderer to convince him that his sinful act of murdering a fellow American was directly under the influence of Satan and if this murderer accept Jesus who died for his sin, he would be sent to heaven ó just like that.

Before and after, still his mind remains demoniac. So what is the sense of developing him as a new born again Christian? So it concludes from here that this is a ìTITLEî. Every time a Christian kills someone, he is given a title: ìNew BORN CHRISTIANî. Their habits are not changed in one day. When they are released from jails under candle lights pressure, they murder or rape other fellow Americans. This process goes on unlimited times till someone in the government wakes up, who may not believe in these Christian methods, and put a stop to the demands of these Catholic candle light demonstrators outside the jail.

Islamic criminals forcefully entered into Vedic temples where men-devotees and children were killed during prayers. And women were raped. Among them, the most famous was the temple of Somnath where women were raped and taken as concubines. Islamic fanatics urinated on the templeís deities and stole gold ad other valuables decorating deities and also from the Temple of Somnath. There are thousands of such vandalizations of Vedic temples by Islamic fanatics. The Koran and the Kafir ( Islami and infidel) by A.

These two young boys were bricked alive for not abjuring the Vedic Dharm of consciousness. They later died. It is the mentality of the snake who cannot make a distinction of his bite to the passerby. Islamic society teaches them the mentality of viciousness leading into criminal tendencies without rational thinking and this empowers them through the Koranic-psyche to strike without any distinction or regard to human values. In America, the black Moslems are being created out of hate who want to strike back once they gain power through large population growth. They are hiding under, the so-called, religious pretext. The activities of Islamic people would make Robin Hood looks like an infant in the cradle. For example Shah Jahan commandeered the famous Shiva Temple of Agra known as Tejo Mahalaya belonging to the Maharaja of Jaipur. He covered the edifice with outer stone coating walls with Koranic inscriptions and turned the temple of Lord Agreshwar into a Mausoleum and named it the Taj Mahal. Several beautiful palaces belonging to the Hindus were similarly commandeered by the Moslem rulers and turned into Imambaras as can be seen in Lucknow, U.P., India, even today.

This maniac, a follower of the Koran, had ordered the mass slaughter of infants, women, old people, young for the forced conversion into Islam He had ordered his criminal soldiers to collect at least 1 1/4 Maund (approximately 110 pounds) Janoi (a sacred thread), to be weighed at the end of each day, which were pulled out from the bodies of Hindus for their forced conversion to Islam. Those who did not accept Islam were severely tortured and later were murdered. The sacred threads were pulled out from their dead bodies to add up to the difference which this fanatic Moslem king required each dayís quota. We still have such societies existing worldwide in todayís modern time. It is definitely a disgrace to such countries, who claim to be modern, to continue to follow such stupid books.

The fact is turning otherwise around. Russia will become the ally with USA before the war not after the war, as the original manuscriptís predictions were made by the French Seer.

Hindusí rate of growth is 1/3rd. of Moslems and Catholics living in India per 1,000 of their population. In other words Hinduís population rate of growth is much lower than 16.8/1,000.

EXAMPLE: Population of India in 1870 was 200 million from World Book Encyclopedia. : From ReaderíS Digest Almanac, the census of new discovered land the United States of America showed: 3,929,625 in the year 1790. Today Indiaís population has increased to 3.75 times or 1870 figures, when the United States of Americaís population has increased more than 61 times of 1790 census. With this growth rate the population of the United States will surpass Indiaís population in the next 30-40 years. It took from year 1870 till now to increase 3.75 times population in India. Moslems, Catholics and African countryís growth rates are going 2-3 times per year in comparison to Indiaís birthrate per thousand population. Australia and Oceania are under the control of Britain. The Queen of Britain appoints the Governor-General and six state Governors in Australia. Total area occupied: 2,967,909 square miles excluding Oceania area. Total population of Australia and Oceania: 24,392,000. Please note : Australia did not exist in 1870. Great Britain had sent 168,000 convicts to subdue, replenish, and to cultivate this land from the so-called, Aborigines. In the year 1870, there could not possibly have any count of population and, therefore, the comparison does not hold good where it is said that Indiaís rate of birth per years is equivalent to almost Australiaís population.

Indiaís total area; 1,269,346 square miles with a population of 950 million. This is equivalent to 1/3rd. land of USA and more than three times the population of USA. India in comparison to Australia is like this: If there are 500 sheep living in a 1000 acre farm how many could be produced each year? The most could become 1,000 at the end of a year. What about if there were only 10 sheep living in a farm size of 3,000 acres? What is the most number, can grow into each year? The most they could become: 20 in number. Naturally, there is no way these smaller number of sheep living in three times the farm size could catch up with the old farm sheep unless there is a serious catastrophe or they are transferred into this bigger farm occupied by 10 sheep in order to prove a zero increase in population. For example many Western countries have shown zero increase in population lately because they can move from their countries to new foundlands with hardly any formalities of migration. If the economy in USA is bad, they either go to Canada or Australia. It is almost impossible for a common person of India to get a visit visa and whatever has migrated from India to these Western countries, their percentage amount to: 0.0018666% of present population of India.

So without their destruction ( Vedic texts and strict followers), the missionaries, ministers, pastors, Jesuits do not feel secure and fear that they may be exposed to their criminal activities through the true knowledge of Vedas . 3 rd EXAMPLE Polygamy law for Moslems applies very strongly in India because Moslems have tendencies, in the twentieth century, to control a country, where there is a non- Moslem majority by superseding through the fast Islamic population birthrate. The government of India has made two laws. For Moslems, polygamy, of four marriages, is allowed but for a non-Moslem there is another law, i.e., one marriage. But the law must be uniform regardless Moslem or non-Moslem living in a country. If you look into the above birth rate per thousand, Moslemsí birthrates in Islamic countries have been 2-3 times of Indiaís birthrate per thousand. Also it must be taken into considerations that there are more than one hundred fifty-million Moslemsí population in India. 4 th EXAMPLE: Though a Christian is allowed to marry one woman at a time by the laws of the USA, but he can kidnap someoneís fellow American wife or someoneís mother through the legal system of the courts. Many suicides, traumic pains and sorrows are caused by broken homes. This vicious cycle does not end in the first round.

(Ibid., Vol. V. Page 421). As Swami Vivekanand says, it was ìlike the gentle dew that fails unseen and unheard and yet bring into blossom the fairest of roses.î The contribution of India to the thought world is ìsilent, unperceived, yet omnipotent in its effect, it has revolutionized the thought of the world. ìHinduism is infinite and Christianity will be absorbed eventually, in spite of the anti-Hindu propaganda and proselytizing work carried on by its perverted missionaries. Hinduism has the capacity to do so. In this connection it is good to remember the word of Sir Monier Williams (1819-1899), quoted by Swami Vivekanand in a letter to his disciple Mrs. Hale on July 1, 1894 (The letter has been reproduced in October issue of Prabuddh - Bharat, 1979, Page 433). Swami Vivekanand remarks: ìHere I find a quotation from a speech by Sir Monier Williams, Professor of Sanskrit in Oxford University. It is very strange as coming from one who every day expects to see whole of India converted to Christianity. He says: - ìAnd yet it is remarkable characteristic of Hinduism that it neither requires nor attempts to make converts. Nor is it at present, by any means, decreasing in numbers, nor is it being driven out of the field by two such proselytizing religions as Mohammedanism and Christianity. On the contrary, it is rapidly increasing. And far more remarkable than this is that, it is all receptive, all-embracing, all comprehensive. It claims to the one religion of humanity, of human nature, of the entire world. It cares not to oppose the progress of Christianity, not of any other religion. For it has no"},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"The Ultimate Guide for One World Order 307 difficulty in including all other religions within its all-embracing arms and even widening old. And in real fact, Hinduism has something to offer which is suited to all minds. Its very strength lies in its infinite adaptability to the infinite diversity of human characters and human tendencies. It has its highly spiritual and an abstract side suited to the philosophical higher classes. Its practical and concrete side is suited to the men of affairs and the man of the world. Its aesthetic and ceremonial side is suited to the man of poetic feeling and imagination. Its quiescent and contemplative side is suited to the man of peace and love of seclusion. Indeed, the Hindus were Spinosists 2,000 years before the birth of Spinoza. Darwinianís centuries before the birth of Darwin, the Evolutionists centuries before the doctrine of evolution had been accepted by the Huxleys of our time, and before any word like evolution existed in any language of the world.î These edifying words of Sir Monier Williams were addressed to the Oxford University students under training for administrative and missionary work in India, then under the rule of English East India Company. These Christians must pay attention to these enlightening words of Sri Monier Williams and refrain from carrying on their dirty job of proselytization and mean propaganda work. They should be proud of being known as Hindus in the ancient custom, as the true children of ìMother Indiaî inheriting the precious culture of their original forefathers, the Aryan Rishi-teachers of Bharat . They are really Aryan s , and not Semitics as taught by the perverted Oriental Scholars of the modern West. The attire of Semitic superstitions is superimposed on them by ignorance. The Vedic texts speak that the original language of ìthe Aryan s î was Sanskrit . These British Christians divided India into two races: ì Aryan î and ìDravidianî in the south to make their merry-world go in their own style which had eventually set the world into fast-pace of racial hatred on the bodily complexions reason.

Does it not prove their malice intentions? Just like a small child trying to pollute a clean glass of water by putting a dirty drop of oil. What happens? The dirty drop of oil emerges out on the surface of clean water and you just pluck it and dumps it in the trash where it belongs. That is exactly this book is doing to set the records of the world in proper perspective as they were and as they should be. Please note : The Oriental Western Scholars and Christiansí Scholars are filling the volumes of pages unnecessarily with being self-directed and /or guided. How could they change the world when they themselves are in material sense confusions, and desire to lord over the worldís resources? A great Indiaís sage - Swami Prabhupadjee, explains the meaning of Vedas : ìThe Sanskrit verbal root of Veda means knowledge. The teachings of Vedas are the original knowledge. In the conditioned state, our knowledge is subjected to many deficiencies. We must accept this fact. The difference between a conditioned soul and a liberated soul is that the conditioned soul has got four kinds of defects. (1) The first defect is that he must commit mistakes; (2) Another defect: to be illumined. Illusion means to accept something which is not maya. Maya means what is not. If I ask you what you are, you will say, ìI am Mr. John; I am a rich man; I am this; I am that.î All these are bodily identifications. But you are not this body. This is illusion; (3) The third defect is the cheating propensity. Everyone has the propensity to cheat others. Although a person is a fool number one, he poses himself as very intelligent. Although it is already pointed out that he is in illusion and makes mistakes, he will theorize: ìI think this is this, this is that.

So what power do you have to see? We cannot therefore, expect knowledge( Veda ) with these imperfect senses. With all these deficiencies, in conditioned life, we cannot give perfect knowledge to anyone, nor are we ourselves perfect.

MANTRAS:"},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"The Ultimate Guide for One World Order 311 Mantras are highly recommended in the Vedic texts for oneís gradual change into positive directions and eventually nullifying the negative effects of ì Karma î: ìCAUSE AND EFFECT.î They must be chanted to purify oneís existence and environment. Just like one take fresh juice and milk to nourish the human nobody, similarly, the chanting of mantras is the nourishment of the ìSoulî. So one must not consider it a brainwashing as many American Psychiatrists have found the most lucrative business in up rooting those who are already enjoying the nectar of peace through the process of chanting mantras and yogic meditations of ìOMî . Without the chanting of mantras, the soul position is absolutely like a ëdry up stemí. There are various mantras and one must seek the advice of the right spiritual master in his area. Again let none disrupt your mind against the recitation of mantras . If the fox has not tasted the grapes, it does not mean that grapes are sour. So it is not brainwashing but washing the brain with all sorts of material contaminations. NO COMPROMISE: This is to be understood that this human life is extremely valuable. There are 8,400,000 species of life and after transition through them, one is awarded the highest body in the shape of human on our planet earth. So we cannot blow it. We have to be extremely careful to reward this human life with virtues to upgrade our higher consciousness either in this life or life after this. So if we compromise with all sorts of vices or confusions, then the consciousness will downgrade. When the man is frustrated with all sorts of vices and other ìtrappedî human characteristics, he needs the proper answers.

So compromise is: No, No."},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"Hrsikes Das Mitriya 312 So out of fear or because of low class people around us, we must never compromise. This is the first principle of Vedic teachings. There are many present day, the so-called, Gurus , who are constantly compromising. They have been paid unlimited monies to topple the Vedic system. These Gurus say: ìEvery religion teaches ë the absolute truthí and Allah, Jesus, Mohammed and Vedic God are one and the same. The Bible, and the Koran and the Vedas are all the same. Everything is OK. No problem.î In other words, they are compromising and not speaking as it is because their mouths are sealed by being paid large sums of monies in different countriesí bank accounts. Beware of such Gurus . Stop them from teaching this pluralist views. In fact, they are keeping the masses where they are and not giving them a chance to see the light at the end of tunnel. The following people did not compromise from ìTHE ETERNAL TRUTHî. MAHATMA BUDDH (Sakya-Muni) , never deviated from the basic fundamental laws of Vedic truth and taught very boldly the principles of nonviolence. Mahatma Buddh was threatened for his life several times but it did not make him change the message of the eternal truth. But Jesus compromised the learning of the Vedas after coming back from India, with low down people, by making water into wine; offering them animal flesh; approving the teaching of the Old Testament by celebrating Passover and advising his disciples to follow the words of Jehovah. MAHATMA BUDDH SAID: ìHE WHO ATTAINS TRUE KNOWLEDGE OF RIGHTEOUSNESS FROM THE VEDAS , ATTAINS A STEADY POSITION.î SHANKRACHARYA , who brought back the lost Vedic culture had many enemies. He did not change or compromise the religious principles. He stayed firmly on the principle of Eternal Truth until His death. RISHI DAYANAND SARASWATI did not deviate from speaking the ëEternal Truthí.

The king had more interest in prostitutes and alcohol. He was a great sage with a divine quality of fearlessness. SWAMI PRABHUPADA JEE did not compromise on the very basic principles of religion. He was dealing with very low class of people yet he did not make water into wine by coming over to the west in order to spread the teachings of Vedas . This is the real difference between the true devotee of God and the one who is working for personal ego, fame or name. RENUNCIATION AND DUTIES: Just by simply working, one shall not reach to the path of eternity, blissful life, and knowledge. One must work in devotion to God Krishn and in every circumstance; God Krishn must come first and foremost for the ultimate benefit of the society. There are several verses taken from Bhagavad Gita on the topic ìRenunciation and Dutiesî. Before that I will like to clarify, this long misunderstood meaning of renunciation as is created by many past and present Gurus . This misconception has also continued the downfall of India. Example: A Hindu born Engineer here in USA told me that he would like to leave his family with small children and go to a secluded place Rishikesh near Ganga River and, thereafter, would live in peace resounding the glories of the Lord. If he does some work in service of God then it is OK to go to secluded place.

The asses are those who are grossly foolish, like a hard-working beast of burdens. They want to enjoy the fruits of their labor by themselves and so do not want to part anything, neither for society nor for the Supreme. The humble beast is made to work very hard by his master for eating some grass at the end of the day but this beast of burdens do not realize that he can eat all the grass growing wild in the pasture. This is the position of the foolish fruitive worker for whom he should work. The implying meaning here is that one must work honestly but one must not be attached to work for the purpose of hoarding that it becomes the only purpose of oneís life as is the case with the present society. Everyone, is running to make a million dollars, Great Swami Prabhupadjee once said to the assembly of American devotees: ìA dog in India runs on four legs while the professor in America runs on four wheels.î As an intelligent person, one must perform the duties of work in devotion to God renouncing the ëfruits of activitiesí to God. There is no such implying meaning of renunciation to simply sleep all day and shoot the pool with friends in the night. Anyone, who is the devotee of the Lord Krishn works very hard in serving for the ultimate benefit of the society. God Krishn instructs in Bhagavad Gita in multiple verses to work in devotion to God, society etc.: (I am quoting some verses hereunder). ìLET NOT THE WISE DISRUPT THE MINDS OF IGNORANT WHO ARE ATTACHED TO FRUITIVE ACTION. THEY SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED NOT TO REFRAIN FROM WORK, BUT TO ENGAGE IN WORK IN THE SPIRIT OF DEVOTIONî . . . Chapter 3, Verse 26. ìNOR BY MERELY ABSTAINING FROM WORK CAN ONE ACHIEVE FREEDOM FROM REACTION, NOR BY RENUNCIATION ALONE CAN ONE ATTAINS PERFECTION ì . . . Chapter 3, Verse 4.

Chapter 3, Verse 24. ìON THE OTHER HAND, HE WHO CONTROLS THE SENSES BY THE MIND AND ENGAGE HIS ACTIVE ORGANS IN WORK OF DEVOTION, WITHOUT ATTACHMENT, IS BY FAR SUPERIOR.î Chapter 3, Verse 7. There is a vast difference between work in devotion and work for fruitive results and if one renounces the fruitive results then he is said to be in the state of renunciation before his material body age 75. In other words he must not be working for simply to mint money as a hoarder and keep everything to himself in the locker. This will be considered greed, not a ëwork in devotioní. Such people are rascals who never spend a cent in the service of the society and God. ìPERFORM YOUR PRESCRIBED DUTY, WHICH IS BETTER THAN NOT WORKING.

Chapter 5, Verse 10. The following verse is a conclusion of the sum of all the verses on renunciation and duties: ìONE WHO IS BEYOND DUALITY AND DOUBT, WHOSE MIND IS ENGAGED WITHIN, WHO IS ALWAYS BUSY WORKING FOR THE WELFARE OF ALL SENTIENT BEINGS, AND WHO IS FREE FROM ALL SINS, ACHIEVES LIBERATION IN THE SUPREMEî..

Why were these particular books chosen? Why four Gospels instead of one? Irenaeus: ìThere are four quarters of the earth in which we live and four universal windsî The Gospels were unknown to Peter, Paul, and the early Church Fathers. They were forged later. The Bible did not assume anything like its present from until the fourth century. The Roman Catholic, Greek Catholic, and Protestant canons were not adopted until modern times. The Bible was recognized as a collection of independent writings. The Council of Trent (1563) determined the Roman Catholic canon, consisting of seventy-two books. The Romanists anathematize the Protestant Bible, and the Protestants denounce the Catholic Bible as a ìpopish imposture.î The Greek Catholics at the Council of Jerusalem in 1672 finally accepted Revelation. Their Bible contains several books not in the Roman canon. The Westminister Assembly in 1647 approved the list of sixty-six books composing the authorized Version, the one most used in America. Our Bible, therefore, is less than 300 years old. Adoption was by majority vote. None of the men contributing most to form the canon accepted all these books. Chrysostom, who named the Bible, rejected six of the sixty-six - Esther, Jonah, Hebrews, James, Jude, and Revelation. Calvin excluded Revelation as unintelligible.

It is the source of light to the senses. It is strong, restless, impetuous and difficult to control who have no sense of Methodology. The speed of the mind is faster than the light. So how could you control something, which runs in all directions with a speed which is even faster than light (light travels at 186, 282 miles per second)? The Semitic and heavily influenced Semitic religions (Christianity and Islam) do not have any methodology to restrain oneís mind. The Bhagavad Gita (a brief summary of the Vedas ) and other Vedic texts give us a comprehensive knowledge and practical side of it: ìHow to restrain the impetuous mind?î It is the practice which makes one perfect even if one fails twenty times. If one keeps on trying under the proper guided instructions of Spiritual Masters, the violent and impulsive mind could be restrained. It requires constant practice and renunciation. As explained earlier, renunciation here does not mean to give up your prescribed duties and wander in the jungle. Renunciation here means: not to be attached to the fruits of work. The senses play the major role for leading oneís mind to be uncontrolled. The senses impetuously carry away the mind of even a wise man; wherever the unsteady mind goes, it should be brought back. If the mind (reins) is properly restrained and the senses (five horses of a chariot) are controlled by the charioteer (Intellect) then the master of the chariot can remain in a comfortable zone. The mind is the cause of bondage as well as liberation of mortals. If gets engrossed in sensuous objects, it leads to bondage but when it runs away from them, it liberates the soul. It is purified by practicing truthfulness. It is the subtle part of the food which goes to make up the mind. ìMAY MY KIND, WITHOUT WHICH NO ACT CAN BE DONE, ENTERTAIN BENEFICIAL THOUGHTS.î ...

But flesh eating was always condemned as a religious injunction on the basis of four Vedas .

If there is no previous life, then God alone being the five of all, experiences sweet and bitter would be guilty of being partial and cruel in making some happy and others, unhappy.

He could not possibly pass the complete information to the rigid followers who were absolutely trapped by Semitism. Therefore, he tried to compromise in order to influence many of the confused minds and that later gave rise to the perverted form of a religion, called Christianity. It has to disappear from the scene for humansís survival on this planet in order to bring the ultimate peace and coexistence. So Christianity is a mild form of Semitism.

EARLIER INFILTRATION: The book ì The History of The Assassinsî was originally derived from Hinduism sources by the Chavalier Joseph Von Hammer, Author of The ìHistory of the Ottoman Empireî , etc. in the year 1760 into German language. It was later translated into English in 1835 by Oswald Charles Wood, M.D. of Great Britain from German language. In the year 1926, Swami Shraddhanand of Swami Dayanand Saraswati Sansthan brought the same English reprint in India. From page X through XVIII , I am giving in brief summary, for the Gyannis Intelligentsia as follows: King John III received the warriors of Christ in Lisbon, Portugal from Pope of Rome. The names of these warriors of Christ were Rodriguez and Frances Xavier who were to Christianize of all the idol (deity)- worshipers in the world. (Please note that the cross is nothing but a mere idol reminding its followers ìhow to take revenge from Jewsî ever since its inception 2,000 years ago) . These warriors of Christ were called Jesuits. Frances Xavier was provided with Papal briefs by virtue of which he was appointed ìrepresentative of the Popeî for whole of India. Thus well provided by King John III, Frances Xavier proceeded to India on the 7 th April, 1541 and did not reach before 6 th May,1542; but no sooner his ship touched the harbor of Goa than, disdaining royal equipage and princely residence . . . ìhis first care was to betake himself at once to the hospital, in order there to nurse the sick himself, and to get his own means of support from the public alms.î But this dodge did not succeed . . . î the second was much more"},{"pageNumber":433,"pageContent":"The Ultimate Guide for One World Order 387 effectual, and consisted in pulling down, with the assistance of the Portuguese troops, which saint Xavier called into requisition, the native Hindu temples, and breaking in places the deities (Idols) found therein. Xavierís Companion Anton Criminal by name became furious and ìpersecuted the Brahmins with the most inhumane cruelties.î He established Inquisition in Goa which proceeded with the most rightful severity against all those who offered any resistance to the spread of Christianity in India. In this way the innumerable Brahmins , and more particularly the richest among them, lost their lives by the executionerís hands. As a matter of course, the effeminate Hindus now pressed forward to have themselves baptized, rather than make acquaintance with the prisons of the Inquisition, OR RUN THE RISK OF BEING ROASTED ALIVE OVER THE SLOW FIRE! After this fashion did Francis Xavier and his associates conduct themselves in India, and the conscious was that Jesuit colleges sprang up in all suitable places. And still more numerous were the Churches which were erected, as they no longer hesitated to destroy, with fire and sword, all the heathen temples which they were able to get at. ìAfter consolidating his missionary work, in this way, in India Frances Xavier left for Japan and then for China, later died on 2nd December, 1552 at the age of forty-six. After his death the Jesuits changed their tactics from open Jihad (killing) to secret machinations through hypocrisy and cheating by personation.î PAGE XV - SAME BOOK: ìMany of these missionaries attired themselves as Indian priests or Brahmins . One of them namely, Peter Constatino Beschi, who had most carefully studied the Hindi language, as well as Sanskrit , imitated the customs and manners, no less than the people of Dakkhan (South India), actually began to honor him as a saint. He wore Hindu Saddhu costume. The ruler of the Dakkhan, in the belief that he was a true Brahamin, raised him, to be his first court official and minister, and Constatino"},{"pageNumber":434,"pageContent":"Hrsikes Das Mitriya 388 Beschi did not trouble himself the least to explain the mistake. Peter appeared in public riding upon a richly caparisoned horse, or carried in a palanquin by kingís employees, and always accompanied by numerous escorts on horse backs, who cleared the way for the great man, proclaiming his going and coming at the same time with a flourish of trumpets. No one could have supposed that he was in a reality a baptized Christian. A Jesuit, however, he still remained to the end of his days, and his companions of the order were not a little proud of him.î In other words these Jesuits kiss the cross or Christ once they were in the guise as Brahmins and made the Hindu Brahmins to do likewise, once these Jesuits were assured that the Hindu Brahmins had put the faith in them. In recent years, Keith (son of a Baptist minister) who was initiated by Swami Prabhupad installed a statute of Jesus in West Virginia Hare Krishna Temple after the passing away of Swami Prabhupad . In this advance age of ìJet-Ageî, the world has come closer and closer and, therefore, these topics have lost the validity in modern times. EXAMPLES: Here in USA people from various parts of the world have moved in. This country is a mixture of the entire worldís society and the neighbors are made of various ethnic-groups. Other countries are facing the similar situation throughout this planet earth. Eastern Europe is dissolving Communism. East Germans have moved with West Germans to have bigger autonomy and so on so forth. Mr. Turner is right when he said that nobody around would like to be commanded. Specially, when such commandments are coming from such leaders who had themselves contradicted the entire commandments as culled down from the Bible, earlier. There must be a higher science to make the people aware of, ìWHY SO MUCH GLOBAL PROBLEMS?î There must be a logical foundation in the tune with our present science. It is said by a great sage Swami Prabupad Jee : ìWHATEVER THE EXAMPLES ARE SET BY A GREAT PERSON, COMMON PEOPLE SIMPLY FOLLOW THEM.î"},{"pageNumber":435,"pageContent":"The Ultimate Guide for One World Order 389 ITEM NUMBER 3: ìHUMANS MUST LEARN TO COEXIST WITH OTHER LIVING ENTITIES AND MUST UNDERSTAND HIS PLACE PROVIDED BY THE LAWS OF NATURE WITHOUT CAUSING FURTHER DISTURBANCE(S).î Now it is absolutely necessary to emphasize on a constant basis the importance of ìECOLOGYî and its benefits in nature in order to keep the nature in balance. Why human should coexist with different lives without proving himself/herself to be the only survival specie? Because no living thing, plant, animal or human, could survive alone. They have to learn to coexist with each other with a complete harmony to the laws of nature. It is a close cycle. For example, the cow depends on grass and other plant foods and with that she not only nourishes her offspring but the entire human race through her milk and cowís waste also provides many of the nutrients that plants need. The cowís dung is considered one of the best sources of fertilizers for nourishing plants. Bees are important to invoke beautiful spring around us and by natureís process, they provide nectar in return, what we call it \"HONEYî; Earthworms are important in the cultivation of ground. Environment is a part of Ecology and this is disturbed by cutting too many trees or by ìrapingî the planet for excessive resources in order to fulfill the modern humansí unlimited desires for aimless pursuits. If there are no trees to filter carbon dioxide, how could people breathe? Many scientists study ìEcologyî to give the reasons of depletion of ozone on our space. Sun energy has many kinds of nuclear-rays and if they are not properly filtered through ìOZONEî then we can suffer the trauma of many sicknesses like skin-cancers, blindness and many other related problems and thereby no peace. But these scientists can simply study and fill volumes of pages just to prove their ìhalf- hazardous Pointî. Again nothing is achieved unless the human curtails his desires of hoarding and unlimited sense-gratification."},{"pageNumber":436,"pageContent":"Hrsikes Das Mitriya 390 For example: Todayís Modern Ecologists do not even understand that ìTHE COWî is the most important asset in the chain of this natureís ecology. Without them, no human race can survive because there is a period of ìsurvival-incubationî for each child on our planet to subsist between the time when human mamaís breasts are dried up or not enough milk. The infant canít eat hard substance food because of no teeth or have not developed swallowing capabilities. During this period, the child definitely need ìholy motherî cowís milk. Most of the Modern Ecologists are themselves using so much chemicals and pesticides in their ecological research that has become one of the contributory factors in Ecological-disturbance. I had already discussed, in my earlier writings, that human is a vegetarian specie whose risk of disease and emotional and psychological problems are greatly increased by eating animals. But these present day Ecologist keep on talking of grain fed beef for humansí diet etc. What kind of Ecology are they talking? In other words the Vedic texts define the Ecology in a higher and perfect terms and by the implementation of Vedic teachings, there will be restrained on the part of human being for their unlimited sensual-desires and thereby curtailing the natureís ecological make-up for their own good and for the future generation. There are many topics in Ecology which are studied by present day Ecologist and they are: Movement of energy, food, and other nutrients through an ecosystem. The light energy is changed to chemical, population of species. They try to find answers for the balance of nature and unexpected increases of population but they are short-sighted. Other species of lives are part of our ecology and they are mysteriously helping all of us to coexist. Therefore, our recommendations based on the Ecology must not be any more deterioration of environment any further, but these modern Ecologists are feeding grain-fed murdered animals through their advance ecological studies but the Vedas recommend stopping their killings because nature is getting disturbed. Though these modern day Ecologists are trying to find some good answers but"},{"pageNumber":437,"pageContent":"The Ultimate Guide for One World Order 391 their findings are in one directional ñ they donít want to apply the science of the senses: ìWHY IS SO QUICK DETERIORATION OF ENVIRONMENT?î DUE TO ECONOMIC: The implementation of cow protection at the international level would be a massive step forward in solving the world food crisis. Some economic advantages of cow protection are as follows: (1) Flesh foods are more than 50 per cent water and therefore extremely costly to buy as a source of protein. (2) Land that will produce one ton of beef will produce 10 to 20 tons of highly nutritive vegetable food. (3) For every hundred pounds of dry substances eaten by cattle, only four to sixteen pounds comes back as flesh as currently used for the so-called food BUT THE MODERN DAY ECOLOGISTS ARE RECOMMENDING ìGRAIN FED BEEFî FOR HUMANSí DIET. FROM IT IS APPARENT THAT WE HUMANS MUST ACCEPT THAT WE HAVE NO OTHER CHOICE EXCEPT TO LIVE IN HARMONY TO THE LAWS OF NATURE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE VEDIC UNDERSTANDING. ITEM NUMBER 4. ìIN THIS TEMPORARY LIFE, ONE MUST NOT CLAIM WHICH IS NOT HIS OR HER; LIVE AND LET LIVE; WE ARE ALL PASSING-BY ON OUR TEMPORARY JOURNEY FROM INFANCY, TO CHILDHOOD, TO BOYHOOD, TO YOUTH, THEN TO OLD AGE."},{"pageNumber":438,"pageContent":"Hrsikes Das Mitriya 392 We are a part of this universe and all of us are governed by the laws of nature. We must never think that we are here to claim this planet earth. When you go to other planets, would you overpower your rights of claim than others? What right do you have to prove your claim on something which does not belong to you? George Washington, First President of USA, could not take America with him, not even a fraction of a mili-centimetre. This planet is utilized by everyone to share and to use but not in the sense of hoarding or fencing millions of acres unused land by the power of ìMight is Rightî. How long could you, as an individual, last in this kind of mentality? 40 years, 50 years, or 100 years? But your existence in this material dress is like a blink of an eye in comparison to the age of your soul or the age of this planet earth. Some bugs are born in the night and by the daybreak, they die; some dogs are born and die in the next 5-10 years. So present day human body may last 70-80 years on this planet but again, this is a short time frame.

Why should you send the bulls to the slaughterhouse? This is injustice. How can you gain justice by yourself doing injustice? We must understand the true depth that this planet earth is one of the phases for my passing-through in many cycles of birth and death. So we must open schools to spread the ìTrue Conceptî on the idea ofëwhat is not yoursí and usage of material needs in strict understanding of ìNo-Claimî This planet belongs to everyone and this is true Vedic knowledge, not a hotchpotch of above described communism of ìSUBDUE, REPLENISH, CULTIVATE AND FILL THEM OF THEIR OWN KINDSî.

The Bible emphasizes that an animal does not have a soul but if we go into any logical approach, we shall find that each animal has a soul---may be of lesser intelligence! It is important to have perfect answers with proper understanding of Ecology. ITEM NUMBER 6. ìBELIEFS MAY VARY FROM PERSON TO PERSON BUT THE ETERNAL TRUTH IS UNCHANGED.î There is a clear, like a crystal, distinction between the ìBELIEFSî and the ìETERNAL-TRUTHî. The followers of the Bible might think Moses was a great man, somebody might think that his grandfather was a person who could shake the world, somebody might have a great history of warriors and due to its influence he might have his own beliefs. Regardless of historical reasonings or the country or the country of origin, or family background from father to son, the beliefs of an individual may change from one to another but it must be very well understood, definitely, that they do not make the basis of ìTHE ETERNAL, ABSOLUTE, TRUTH.î The Eternal Truth is the same for all regardless of place of birth, tall or short, human or animal, Christian or Moslem or Jewish , or any kind of beliefs one may hold. Every one of us has to go through the transmigration process of soul i.e. from infancy, to childhood, to boyhood, to youth, and we are all going through birth, disease, old age, and bodily death. These things have not changed for anyone, ever since time immemorial. This itself is a very advance topic and must be discussed with examples. EXAMPLE: Barney Clark receiving an artificial heart by medical doctors is a prime example of building artificial beliefs by egocentric heart surgeons to prove the world that they had defied the laws of death. America was airing this news for months to prove their humansí superiority over the worldñ ìOh, America has won over the death.î Millions of dollars expenditures on this Jarvis heart and medical treatment kept"},{"pageNumber":441,"pageContent":"The Ultimate Guide for One World Order 395 Barney Clarke alive was the biggest joke of the century. That had built many false hopes on the minds of many people. The poor Barney Clark and his family went through all sorts of false promises of being saved by these egocentric heart transplant doctors remaining throughout the time on the deep inserted needles and tubes pored through his veins and bodies and with 4- 5 times heart transplants. The artificial, Javis heart failed and all the dreams and hopes of the Designer got ìshatteredî into pieces for failing to make anticipated billions of dollars. Clark died and family dreams of seeing him alive, went into smoke. When a person does not have deep-rooted teachings, there will be always someone to cheat others who would like to be cheated. It must be understood that we need everybody in the society but when a particular profession becomes a ìchoice professionî for the sole purpose of minting and hoarding money, automatically it will bring the disturbance in the society. These things happen due to lacking ìThe Absolute Truthî. So we must try to get out from the ìgimmicksî of inconsistent ìbeliefsî for the better conscience. It is also happening because the Bible canít provide satisfactory answers to the arguments raised by those who are scientifically advanced and, therefore, everything is either ìvoidî or nothing beyond their own trapped games ó ìno consciousnessî ó ìI am everythingî; nothing else beyond the domain of four walls of a tiny well. ITEM NUMBER 7. ìConsciousness is evolving in various level of life at different degrees.î What is consciousness? Each soul is conscious about its pains and pleasures and the consciousness is spread all over human body or animal body through the presence of soul. If an individual is pinched, the pain is limited to that individual who is pinched and not his brother; even his mother who gave him birth could not feel the pinch or vice-versa. From this we can conclude that each body regardless of shape, size, 2-legged, contains an ìATOMIC-SOULî and its"},{"pageNumber":442,"pageContent":"Hrsikes Das Mitriya 396 consciousness is spread throughout its body. Through the knowledge of the Science of Self Realization, one can clear the consciousness of intelligence. This is the reason, ìWhy Vedic science is so important for all humansî. For example many people keep the dogs and cats in their houses specially in America and many Western European countries. It is O.K. to treat dogs and cats all-right but they have their own place. Keeping them on sofas and beds inside a closed home itself is extremely unhygienic. They normally donít have sense to pass urine and feces in a particular place and are extremely difficult to control. Many animals carry several diseases which are passed down to humans very often, and specially viral infections. It is important to use discretion --- in other words keep them outside the homes. Another example of uncleanliness is to wipe the bottom with a toilet paper after passing feces each time. It smears the bottom and keeps the smell continues on. It is important to wash the bottom with plenty of water and wash the hands, thereafter, with a cleaning material. The Vedic system instructs to take a bath as soon as possible after passing the feces. I have seen many times people, in America, have not even washed their hands after coming out of the toilet and that itself is unhygienic. Vedic teaching constantly talk on ìCleanlinessî in every discussion. Taking a bath daily is not a Hindu-ritual but the instructions of the Vedas to keep oneself clean all the time. That is the reason for so many ìSacred Riversî like Ganga, Yamuna, etc. Without rivers, they cannot keep themselves clean so, naturally, the river water is extremely sacred to all the Hindus because it is a life- sustaining thing. Without water in the desert, people die of thirst, therefore, water is sacred to the Vedic followers, just like the mother cows are sacred to them. As discussed earlier, Saddam Hussein says: ìHis children of Iraq are going to die without receiving milk from the outside world.î What happens, if the water is stopped? The whole country will die. So for sustaining human or plant or animal life, water is the nourishment and without it no life could be sustained. So the"},{"pageNumber":443,"pageContent":"The Ultimate Guide for One World Order 397 riversí water flowing through the towns of India is absolutely sacred to them. There is no joke about it. Only a fool will joke about the Vedic system and its customs because of lacking in thorough details of Vedic customs and their significance. Third Example: If you knew that someone who is your boss does not wash his hands after passing his feces, would you really like to shake his hand when he offers his hand? Would you? How do you know that the person you are saying ìGood Morningî or ìGood Eveningî by shaking his hand is not infected with AIDSí virus? Vedic system recommends to greet each other with folded hands rather than by shaking hands or kissing each other on the cheeks or sometimes on the lips. They can result into unhygienic conditions. One does not know the condition of another personís habits of cleanliness. So Vedic followers greet each other with folded hands by bowing their heads little down and saying the word: ë NAMASTE î to each other. Not good morning or good evening. Namaste is the highest form of the universal salutation. This means that the saluting parties recognize: ìYOU ARE A SOUL AND I AM A SOUL, PART AND PARCEL OF THE SAME GOD, OUR ETERNAL FATHER. THEREFORE, I RESPECTFULLY BOW DOWN TO YOU.î So there is no question of transmitting any sort of disease through handshakes or kissing each others on skins or lips. One time, I was invited to someoneís house. Once I pulled in the driveway, I saw a big barking dog tied on the front porch. The owner eventually came out after hearing his barking dog. When he proceeded toward me, he asked: ìWhy did I wait in the car?î I replied because of his big barking dog. He tried to convince me by saying: ìDonít you know that barking dogs donít bite?î ìI understand this; does your dog know this, since he is barking loud, he it not suppose to bite?î And he laughed to the ground."},{"pageNumber":444,"pageContent":"Hrsikes Das Mitriya 398 ITEM NUMBER 8. ìANATOMY IS A WAY IN VISUALIZING HUMAN TO RESPECT THE EXISTENCE OF ALL LIVES.î Anatomy of human/animal bodies, like their structural make- up of organs or any of its parts. Various functions and analysis of bodiesí parts and their comparisons, skeletons etc. will give the real visualization in the understanding the ìscience of Self- Realizationî and the natureís gift to us in the make-up of these bodies and the similarities. Anatomy of different bodies whether black or white, Mexican or German, fat or skinny, tall or short, yellow or brown, country of birth of beliefs, human or animal, if discussed on a regular basis would bring the proper understanding.

ITEM NUMBER 9. Man will always reap what he has sown today and he reaps most definitely what he has sown in the past. The action what one has performed (positive or negative) has an effect (positive or negative). This is also called ìCause and Effectî - The laws of Karma . This law governs all human actions; good, bad, or indifferent: personal or impersonal. Humanís actions are good or bad accordingly as they cause happiness or sorrow to other beings: ëman, birds, beasts, etc. . . í Personal actions are those which concern and affect the doer alone i.e. eating, drinking, sleeping. They bear fruit in the same human existence and lives thereafter are not affected by them. Impersonal actions are two-pronged. They concern not only the doer but also affect others beneficially or adversely. They are, as it was, both the cause and the effect or the seed and the fruit. As far as the doer is concerned, he will reap the reward or"},{"pageNumber":445,"pageContent":"The Ultimate Guide for One World Order 399 punishment of his actions here or hereafter. Their effect on others is, however, the result, reward or punishment of their past actions. All human actions, in so far as they affect others must fit in with Divine Dispensation. The law of Karma postulates that there is a reward and punishment for every good and evil human action and that the reward or punishment is meted out to the doer not in the very existence but in some life or lives hereafter. Only the Divine dispensation is fair and just. No person, however, mighty, strong or highly placed, can thwart eternal laws nor can any being, however weak and lowly placed, be deprived of its benefits. Many Christians oppose this law of Karma because they are looking for their fun loving answers; ìWORLD OF CHEATERS AND BE CHEATEDî. They go to these polluted Catholic priests to wash their sins either on weekly or biweekly basis. These Catholic priests are constantly challenging Almighty by misguiding their trapped congregations that they are ìauthorized agentsî of some ìpresumed Godî to wash the sins. In the process many women have been sexually abused. A damning book ìA Secret World: Sexually and the Search for Celibacyî by Benedictine monk A. W. Richard Sipe and also Baltimore Psychotherapist. This book says that a half of the U. S. Catholic clergy also break vows of celibacy. These are not the recent problems in the Catholic Church. This had been going on ever since their foundation. These Catholic priests themselves have no control on their bodies and desires; how could they cleanse their congregation membersí sins on a weekly or biweekly basis? These are all, absolutely, cheating propensities. There had been thousands and thousands of cases where these priests have taken advantage of the congregation membersí circumstances by sexually abusing them. The Houston Post of Sunday, October 28, 19 90 writes on the front page: ì1990 has not been a good year for American Catholic clergy. Sex scandals have led to the resignation of Atlanta Archbishop Eugene A. Marino and the Rev. Bruce Ritter, founder of Covenant House in New York City.

Guzman worked at a Navssota Church until he was discovered in a sexual act with a 13-year minor child girl . . . The Houston Post/Sunday, October 28, 1990. The report says that the diocese officials played a ìhide and seekî game of ìHushñHushî for several years to protect this Catholic priest and kept him as a priest until Ms. Debbie McCovey decided to file a lawsuit of $11 million. Sexual misconduct first surfaced as a big problem during the mid- 1980s, when seven Catholic priests working in Louisiana parishes were charged with sexually abusing young boys. One priest is now serving 20 years in prison. The Louisiana diocese has reportedly paid more that $20 million in settlements to families. If there was the government of Catholics in USA, they would have never let this case come out at the surface. It is because of the US Government, such cases could be brought on trial. Even higher than any countryís government including USA, there is the SUPREME GOVERNMENT OF THE ALMIGHTY WHOSE LAWS ARE DISPENSED BY THE ìLAW OF KARMA î. In the past Britishers had insulted Vedic texts and disputed the Law of Karma by arguing that there is no witness then how one can suffer the consequence of ìCause and Effectî. According to Vedic text there is not just one witness but at least two for sure but it could be more depending upon ëhow many souls were hurtí by oneís activity: (1) The self action is registered through oneís brain, (2) The Omniscient God, The Knower of everything and every mind, (3) Those souls involved due to your impersonal actions. Nothing is unchecked."},{"pageNumber":447,"pageContent":"The Ultimate Guide for One World Order 401 Whenever anything is taken out of the context, it loses its power and strength. The very thought of Celibacy had occurred in Vedic texts from where Jesus learned while staying in Jagatnath Temple in Puri, India under the instructions of Brahmins . It is almost impossible to hold the vows of celibacy by the Catholic priesthood. The Catholic Church is trying to ìartificiallyî make its entire priesthood to imitate the ìORIGINAL TEACHINGS OF VEDIC CELIBACYî. There is a complete Vedic system to remain celibate. Meat eating, all sorts of decomposed foods, drinking wine etc. in Catholic churches definitely lead to vices and desires of sensual- pleasures. ìACCORDING TO THE THREE MODES OF MATERIAL NATURE AND THE WORK ASCRIBED TO THEM, THE FOUR DIVISIONS OF HUMAN SOCIETY WERE CREATED BY ME.î ... Bhagavad Gita 4:13. The four social orders described in Bhagavad Gita exist in some form in all societies and they are: (1) Brahmins ñ Intellectual or Spiritual Master; Gurus (Teachers), Swamis class; (2) Kastriyas ñAdministrative or Military class; (3) Vaisyas ñ Businessman or farmer; (4) Sudrasñ craftsman, laborer, plumber, bricklayer, shoemaker etc. class. There is not a single place in the Vedic texts which mentions of looking down upon other class or classes of people. They are four wheels of a cart and are equally important in the systematic cartís movement. They are part of the same machine and each part of the machine must fit in its proper place. Otherwise, the entire machinery will have a malfunction. Similarly, this ìhuman machineryî will have problems Example: When the Garbage collectors of New York City went for a week strike, the whole city of New York had experienced great difficulty and faced with many unhygienic conditions.

So everyone has a choice here in USA, even then they donít pursue, or qualify, for advance education. Vedic System is also the same way after seeing 25 years of student life if one really wants to pursue the life of a Monk, Swami, Guru, one will do so based on his celibate life if one could maintain until the studentís age 25. From this age onward, the student can select the profession, as described above, which he feels that is well suited for him. TO BECOME A MAYAVADI SANAYASI , HE MUST BE A CELIBATE THROUGHOUT HIS LIFE. EVERYONE JUST CANíS BECOME A SANAYASI UNLIKE THE LARGE CATHOLIC ENROLLMENT FOR PRIESTHOOD. THIS IS NOT A BUSINESS. IT IS A SERIOUS MATTER. This is the very basic reasons that you donít find too many Sanayasis in Hindu Vedic System. It is not like a mass enrollment, like Catholic Presets who are expected, by law and order of Catholicism to force them to remain celibate after joining the group of ìexalted professionî Jesuits in their march to subdue the planets in their own style. Their style of habits will not let majority of priests to remain celibate period! In 1960s, these celibate priests and nuns in Mexico had buried their offsprings (infants) out of fear for Catholicsí reputation. The fear is what caused them to do an act which turned out to be criminal. There had been some cases in the entire Vedic history for thousands of years, where some Swamis fell down by getting married. It is considered for a Swami to eat its own ìVomitî.

The ìselfî, check-and- balance, system interjected into the core of the brain cells.

Consequently, he is tempted to take advantage of many women and young girls due to broken homes and misfortunes. American news media has just started exposing them but these problems had been there ever since the foundation of Christianity. The Inquisitions only went after those who were great moralists and scientists opposing the Bibleís Science of Creation. But anyone who joined their group of gangsters, they were protected no matter what they did to the society since the hierarchy had passed through the same systems, so they made a ìHushî, ìHushî on the risk of their own congregation. The laws of Karma are interlinked with the doctrines of ìLiberationî and ìTransmigration of Soulî from one body to another. They are non-separable. The soul is part and parcel of the same Almighty and, therefore, it is divine and immortal but it is imprisoned within the material walls of nine gates as written earlier. EXAMPLE: Let us say a son believes in his father very much. One day he kills a fellow American and starts running toward home after police-chase. He tells his father: ìFather, father, police is coming. I killed a person. Since I believe in you, please go and get arrested.î Do you think this father would like his son criminal stupidities? What would he do? He would take his cowboy boot and start hitting him on his head and finally get him apprehended to the police chasing this ignorant son. So how could Jesus die for someoneís sins? This itself is against the logic and arguments. Could your mother, who gave you birth, take a shower on your behalf when you were an infant? Even your mother could not eat the food, but you had to eat. What is the universe? Why do we have so many planets? Also, we donít have one universe but many. We must educate public that we are on a travel path from planet to planet according to oneís actions and desires.

Bhagavad Gita 18:16. When we talk of heaven and hell there is no need to bind these people under Preachersí clutches by scaring them. We must never put a fear in the minds by such inconsistent discussions: ìIF YOU DO NOT BELIEVE IN THE BIBLE, YOU WILL GO TO HELL AND IF YOU BELIEVE IN JESUS CHRIST (NO MATTER HOW MUCH FILTHY YOU MAY BE), YOU WILL AUTOMATICALLY GO TO HEAVEN.î This itself is the very basic reason of so much hell on our planet. Why is so much over population throughout this globe? If, everyone is going back to heaven, then there should not be any problem for over population. Why are there lower planets and why are there higher planets? God cannot be imperfect. From perfection comes nothing but perfection. Did anyone ever make anything for nothing?

Due to desires of ëtasting the fruits of a tree*, an individual soul falls down into various regions of material planets in order to be manifested in physical bodies. Up to the animal kingdom, the soul activities are well controlled by the laws of nature but once the soul reaches a human destination, he or she got a ìfree willî which through the power of mind get into wrong association and fall down to the darkest regions on material planets.

There are complete descriptions of sufferings that one has to go through further into these lower planets.

These groups are so well convinced through the Bible methods that they are forcing to change the world by imposing the Bibleís Science of Creation. Yet, repeatedly forcing and proving their most ignorant point that the ìEarth is Flat and the Sun moves around the Earthî as discussed in earlier Chapters. These are the results of wrong associations where the mind is wrongly directed to have a further fall down of the soul. With their own way of ìSelf-Convincedî theories, they killed many European scientists and yet they are very proud for American space research which is the result of the Bibleís opposition.

He knows all the worlds and all objects contained therein. It is in Him that enlightened persons obtaining a salvation move freely, as He is above wordily pleasure and pain and is the Sustainer of all.î .. Yajur Ved 32:20. ìThou art our Almighty Father, Thou art our Mother Divine. To Thee alone we pray for peace. We are children always thine.î .. Rig Ved 8.99.11 and Sam Ved 11.70. According to the Vedas , God is not only our Father, but He is also our Mother. This sublime Vedic idea of the Fatherhood and Motherhood of God is the first and the foremost spiritual motivation for developing spiritual brotherhood. ìO man! Praise God who is One and One only and who is the Omnipotent, Omniscient and Omnipresent Lord of all beings.î Rig Ved 6.45.16. ìOne God alone is to be worshiped by all people. He is adorable.î ...

I believe in whatever I want to believe in and you believe in whatever you want to believe in and when in disagreement, let one g roup wage a war on another group. But God Krishn says: ìI AM THE FATHER OF THIS UNIVERSE, THE MOTHER, THE SUPPORT AND THE GRANDSIRE. I AM THE OBJECT OF KNOWLEDGE, THE PURIFIER AND SYLLABLE AUM.

Only the perfect teachings from the perfect God will, eventually, bring back the ëreal-harmonyí to the society at large. God Krishn speaks: ìAlways think of Me, become My devotee, worship Me and offer your homage unto Me. Thus you will come to Me without fail.î Bhagavad Gita 18:65. HOW COULD YOU GO BACK TO THE REAL-HOME (HEAVEN)? Here Lord Krishn instructs to us: ìIf one offers Me with love and devotion a leaf, a flower, fruit or water, I will accept it.î For the intelligence person, it is essential to understand this science of self realization, engaged in the"},{"pageNumber":459,"pageContent":"The Ultimate Guide for One World Order 413 transcendental loving service of the Lord, in order to achieve a permanent, blissful abode for eternal happiness. The process of achieving such a marvelous result is very easy and can be attempted even by the poorest of the poor, without any kind of qualification. The process is so easy that even a leaf or a little water or fruit can be offered to the Supreme Lord in genuine love and the Lord will be pleased to accept it. The fact is that Krishn does not need anything from anyone, because He is self- sufficient, and yet he accepts the offering of His devotee in an exchange of Love and affection. Meat, fish and eggs should not be offered to Krishn . If He desired such a thing as offerings, he would have said so. Instead he clearly requests that a leaf, fruit, flower and water be offered to Him. He clearly speaks about these offerings precisely and Lord Krishn will accept any of them. Therefore, we should understand that He will not accept meat, fish and eggs. In the third Chapter, Verse 13, God Krishn explains that only the remains of sacrifices are purified and fit for consumption by those who are seeking advancement in life and release from the clutches of the material entanglement . . . Those who do not make an offering of their food, He says in the same verse, are eating only sin. In other words, their every mouthful is simply keeping their involvement in the complexities of material nature. WHY KRISHN IS ASKING FOR THE SIMPLE OFFERING? Krishn is not asking for these offering for His own sake since He possesses everything, yet He is making arrangement for the ìlost soulsî to develop love for Him through a reciprocal arrangement. EXAMPLE: A small baby girl, while visiting a neighborhood grocery store with her daddy, asks daddy, ìDaddy, could you give me a quarter? I want candy, I want candyî. Daddy says: ìO.K. Here is a quarter and go and get candyî The baby girl runs to the counter and grabs a candy. Daddy brings this little girl home.

God Krishn speaks in Bhagavad Gita : ìBy Me, in My un-manifested form, this entire universe is pervaded. All beings are in Me, but I am not in them.î Ch. 9:4. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is not perceivable through the gross material senses. He could be only revealed under the proper guidance by someone who has seen. The Truth and engaged in transcendental devotional loving service. Thus, for people in general, He is not visible. Though He is all-pervading, everywhere present, yet, He is not conceivable by the material senses. Chapter 7 of Bhagavad Gita explains that the entire material cosmic manifestation is only a combination of His two different energies - the superior, spiritual energy and the inferior, material energy. Just as the sunshine is spread all over the universe, the energy of the Lord is spread all over the creation, and everything is resting in that energy. Yet one should not conclude that because He is spread all over He has lost his personal existence. Lord says: ëI AM EVERYWHERE AND EVERYTHING IS IN ME, BUT STILL I AM ALOOF.î Here is a crude example: A President heads a government which is but the manifestation of the Presidentís energy; the different government departments are nothing but the energies of the President; and each department is resting on the Presidentís power. But still one cannot expect the President to be present in every department personally. Just like He has open this department through me to disseminate this branch of ìKnowledge of Comparisonî for lifting souls trapped into the darkness of ìabsolute ignoranceî. If people were happy with the present system (the modern time), they would not be waiting anxiously for incoming Messiah. So my brothers and sisters, this is exactly taking place now.

One time, Swami Tilak asked his neo-phyle disciple from Spain whose mind was agitated with passion: ëCould you, right now, take a rope and tie it around that mountain, then give mountain to me on my shoulders?î Devotee replied: ìNo.î The Swami answered to this inquisitive devotee who wanted to be taught Vedic knowledge in a hurry; ìIn this way, I canít take your ignorance on my back if, because of your passion, you are not able to embrace your ignorance.î So through this department of ìKnowledge of Comparisonî, one must see the wisdom in Swami Tilakís words for the entire worldís society and this way they can truly enjoy the nectar of Soma-Ras through the inner strength of Kundalini Yoga. RIG VEDA WARNS: ONE THINKS ONE DRINKS SOMA BECAUSE A PLANT IS CRUSHED. THE SOMA THAT BRAHMINS KNOWñTHAT, NO ONE DRINKS.î A ìMASTER OF SOMA î IS A PERSON IN WHOM THE REPRODUCTIVE ENERGY IS NO LONGER FLOWING DOWNWARD AND OUTWARD BUT INWARD AND UPWARD. These can be done by practice and restraining the senses and control of mind. Donít let the mind control you but learn to control your mind. Further Lord Krishn speaks in Bhagavad Gita to His dear friend: ìO, son of Kunti , at the end of the millennium all material manifestations enter into My nature, and at the beginning of another millennium, by My potency, I create them again.î . . . 9:7. ìThe whole cosmic order is under Me. Under My will it is automatically manifested again and again, and under My will it is annihilated at the end.î .. 9:8. ìAll this work cannot bind Me.

Under its rule this manifestation is created and annihilated again and again.î .. 9:10 . ìFools deride Me when I descend in the human form. They do not know My transcendental nature as the Supreme Lord of all that be.î GOD KRISHN SPEAK: ìI AM THE GOAL, THE UPHOLDER, THE MASTER, THE WITNESS, THE HOME, THE SHELTER AND THE MOST DEAR FRIEND. I AM THE CREATION AND THE ANNIHILATION, THE BASIS OF EVERYTHING, THE RESTING PLACE AND THE ETERNAL SEED.î It must be remembered that manís ignorance and other demoniac qualities are not HIS CREATIONS. These are caused by the mind. When these demoniac influences become too much that is when the annihilation is manifested by Godís automatic arrangement. The following verses will shade some light to our imbalance of nature-like intense heat etc. GOD SAYS: ìO ARJUN , I CONTROL HEAT, THE RAIN AND THE DROUGHT. I AM IMMORTALITY, AND I AM DEATH PERSONIFIED. BOTH BEING AND NONBEING ARE IN ME.î God explains: ìTHOSE WHO DEVOTE THEMSELVES STEADFASTLY TO ME, MEDITATING ON MY TRANSCENDENTAL FORM, RECEIVE ALL BOUNTIES AND SECURITIES FROM ME.î But still His justice is always tempered with mercy. It is His boundless mercy that the soul in incarceration in the motherís womb does not suffer the hardship and horror of confinement because it remains there in a deep slumber. Again it is His mercy that in the lower incarnations of animals, where the soul undergoes sufferings for the sins committed in human lives, the life is embellished with almost the same charm, and happiness as are provided in human lifelike their loving care of their young and the gusto with which animals indulge in eating, mating, sleeping, drinking and defending etc. ìTHE SOUL ENTERS"},{"pageNumber":463,"pageContent":"The Ultimate Guide for One World Order 417 THE MOTHERíS WOMB AND GROWS THERE WITHOUT FEELING AND PAIN WHATSOEVER.î Rig Ved 1-141-5. ìTHE SOUL LIVES IN THE MOTHERíS WOMB WITHOUT EXPERIENCING ANY PAIN.î Rig Ved 10-46-6. ìHE CREATED THE SUN, THE MOON, THE HEAVEN, THE EARTH AND THE MID-REGION AS IN THE PREVIOUS KALPA .î ..

The movement has been a catalytic force in the 20 th century Asian revival of Buddhism and Hinduism and a pioneering agency in the promotion of greater western acquaintance with eastern thought.î SOME OF THE MOST INFLUENTIAL PEOPLE OF ITS DAY WERE ATTRACTED TO THEOSOPHY ó PLAYWRIGHT OSCAR WILDE, POET W.B. YEATS, AUTHOR GEORGE BERNARD SHAW, ARCHITECT FRANK LLOYD WRITER, INVENTOR THOMAS EDISON AND EVEN BASEBALLíS FOUNDER, GENERAL ABNER DOUBLEDAY. Here is a partial sampling of organizations with direct links to earlier Theosophists: from the earlier part of this century came the ëI am Movementí (with three million followers in 1938), Rosicrucianism, the liberal Catholic church, Psychiana, Unity (6 million), Christian Science and sections of the New Thought movement ñ all influential in the higher strata of society. More recent kindred are the Waldorf alternative schools popular in the US and UK; the controversial Church Universal and triumphant of Elizabeth Claire Prophet; the conservative US - based Human Service Alliance; the London School of Economics and St. James School; and new age Channeler J. Knight. The famous Findhorn Garden in Scotland came directly out of theosophy. The Upanishads and Bhagavad Gita translations of Swami Prabhavananda with theosophist Christopher Isherwood were singularly successful in clearly conveying Hindu thought to the West. Leadbeaterís books on occult sciences, such as ëChakrasí and ëAurasí, ëReinforced Patanjaliís Yoga Aphorisms , Aldous"},{"pageNumber":470,"pageContent":"Hrsikes Das Mitriya 424 Huxleyís book, ëDoors of Perceptioní , promoted mystical experience and also psychedelic drugs, leading directly to the explosion of interest in the East in the 60s. If you dig deep enough, youíll find Theosophical influence in the environmental, Animal Rights and Vegetarian Movements. No mystical endeavor in the West is exempt, is it Yoga, meditation, channeling, near death experiences, natural healing, past life research, UFOs, Mt. Shasta or St. Germain. With its strong resemblances to eastern mysticism and spirituality, Theosophy has an inter-winning relationship with Hinduism - especially the Upanishads and Advaita Vedanta ñ also Buddhism. While Hindu scholars may feel that Theosophy has borrowed from Hinduism, present day Theosophists think that theosophy has not borrowed from any religion, but has commonality with many religions, especially Hinduism and Buddhism. On the popular level, activities that the Theosophical Society undertook around the turn of the century, such as bringing Swamis from India who gave Yoga and levitation demonstrations to the general public, aroused peopleís interest in the spiritual sciences of the East. Mysticism also played a large part in Theosophy. Devout members developed and encouraged Siddhis like Reading Peopleís Aura, channeling and past birth memories. Such demonstrations kindled peopleís interest in the mystical aspect of Hinduism. The Theosophists were well versed in philosophy, parapsychology and psychic research. As Gurudev Sivaya Subramuniya Swami commented to the writer Archana Dongre of Los Angeles, ìknowledge about the indestructibility of the soul, the individual soul as being one with the ultimate reality, and awareness of the astral body gave people a new self image. It gave an individual a happy and confident way to look at himself or herself.î A recent issue of Newsweek ran a cover story of Americans ìIn Search of the Sacred.î British author Peter Washington, who has written books on intellectual history, wrote a new book titled Madame Blavatskyís ëBaboon Chroniclingí , ëA History of"},{"pageNumber":471,"pageContent":"The Ultimate Guide for One World Order 425 Mystics and Mediumsí, who brought the Eastern spiritualism in the form of Theosophy to America. Blavatsky worked to introduce into the West the philosophical and religious ideas of the East, with the aim of showing their mutual and interdependent values. She and her colleagues met with a great deal of opposition, but they also attracted much interest through their writings, lectures and personal contacts. Annie Besant became the international president of the Theosophical Society after Col. Olcott ís death, who had become president after Blavatsky passed away in 1907. It was in India that another Theosophical leader, British-born Irish lady, Mrs. Annie Besant, was instrumental in helping the Theosophical Society. Besant first came to know about Theosophy in 1889 in England when she was asked to review the secret doctrine. She was so impressed that she was drawn into the Theosophical Society. She had made a name for herself as a journalist, prolific writer and publisher, and was actively involved in many movements. She first went to India in 1893 in connection with the Theosophical work. Besant made India her home, and obviously loved Bharatís spirituality: ìafter a study of some forty years and more of the great religions of the world, I find none so perfect, none so scientific, none so philosophic and so spiritual as the great religion known by the name of Hinduism. Make no mistake; without Hinduism, India has no future. Hinduism is the soil into which Indiaís roots are stuck, and torn out of that, she will inevitably wither, as a tree torn out from its place. And if Hindus do not maintain Hinduism, who shall save it? If Indiaís own children do not cling to her faith, who shall guard it? India alone can save India, and India and Hinduism are one.î She translated several Upanishads with commentaries in English. She contributed highly and significantly to the cause of Hinduism as well as Theosophy. In India, Annie Besant saw that under the influence of the Western way of thinking, education and Christian missionaries, young educated Indians had begun to lose pride in their past"},{"pageNumber":472,"pageContent":"Hrsikes Das Mitriya 426 ideals, culture and religion, and observed that Indiaís ancient and superior civilization in the world was being robbed economically and intellectually by the British but those people who were drawn to Theosophy, and believed in its doctrine, in a way also believed in Vedanta and many aspects of Hindu philosophy. Thus during the oppressive British regime, when the political environment was not conducive to Hinduism, Besant as well as the Theosophical movement kept peopleís interest in Hinduism alive and flourishing. Charles Webster Leadbeater, a colleague Theosophist of Annie Besant who was exactly as old as she, was a great mystic who became prominent in the Theosophical Society in the 1890's. Gifted with a robust physique and a dynamic personality, among his mystical powers was an ability to trace peopleís past lives. He is credited to have ëdiscoveredí Krishnamurti in 1908 when the boy was 13. Being clairvoyant, Leadbeater saw a luminous aura, without a trace of selfishness around Krishnamurti. He declared him an incarnation of Lord Maitreya and the future Messiah. Krishnamurti left the Theosophical Society in 1929, but he left an imprint and a legacy on the worldís philosophical thought. In this way the Theosophy and Hinduism were intertwined together, and while Theosophyís doctrine echoed in parts at least, the Hindu Sanatan Dharrm and Vedanta , seemingly having rooted in the Hindu philosophy, the Theosophists maintain that their doctrine is not rooted in any religion, but only shares a similarity with others. These excerpts are taken from ë Hinduism Todayí , monthly newspaper, issue of June 1995 ñ dedicated by Archana Dongre from Los Angeles, California. ìThe subtle self is known by thought in which the senses in five different forms have centered.

Around the middle of November 1995, quite different scenes were exhibited throughout American televisions in the name of Christianís miracles: ìThe blood and tears were coming out from the statues of Jesus Christ and Mary in Cochabama, Bolivia, other parts of central and south American countries and certain parts of America. The Almighty has sent the message through Jesusí statute that you Christians have been responsible for the murders of billions of cows and other animals and since you cannot bring the murdered animals back to life there is definitely no deliverance for you and that simply means that the time has run out. No more ëmight is rightî type militant groups needed on the Bhulok (the Planet of Death). Lord has displayed by examples that we must give great regards to the mother cows who is so valuable that even their milk is accepted by the Lord. Examples have been set. There is a great wisdom in the above scenarios displayed by the Almighty by Himself to set some examples for the next century and the absolute meaning is explained here by the devotee of the Lord. Please accept this message not in the form of a challenge but to rectify the consciousness of higher taste for souls who are trapped due to the Ignorants, the so-called Godís messengers.

If good actions are performed in oneís life, one can fulfill oneís desires and that is it but if oneís actions are performed wrong, then one has to live within very severe conditions of life without having any mercy. The souls seeing other souls having the pleasures of material satisfactions; desire for that kind of life while performing good actions; and this way they get again trapped into the cycle of birth and death for some kind of temporary, monetary gains and other satisfactions. These various desires keep them trapped into the vicious cycle of material births and deaths. Those who have refrained from the material desires of sense-gratifications with the proper understanding as laid down in the Vedic texts called ìinactionî are deserved to be restored back to the spiritual kingdom. In order for one to get out of the trap laid down by many Ignorants under names of, the so-called, religions, one must first come to the understanding that the God, Almighty, is one and only one, He is neither the second nor the third -nor the tenth for all the souls. He is the Father and the Mother for all whose presence can be felt by the proper recitation of the Mantras or singing of the spiritual songs with the purity of mind and clean heart.

They are just simply sucking out the resources of this planet for their economic wealth ñ in other words raping the planet earth to prove that they are the dictators and controllers of this planet. The egocentric maniacs and fools have determined to kill anything which moveth on the earth, kill anything which flies, and kill anything which moves in the water . . . from Genesis , the Bible. This is the most single reason for the Jewish displacement from Arabia by the pals of Mohammed of Islam.

So the word is an ìassociationî. Bad habit is also a bad association for the destruction of the soul, for higher consciousness. To group yourself into the federation for money greed is a bad association because it hoards the wealth over other souls who are also our brothers and sisters. They are also our children. If your child cries for milk and you have no money to pay for milk, that child will starve to death because he cannot accept any other food except milk, since the child does not have teeth, and, therefore, canít chew any hard substance and also he does not have any swallowing capabilities. The child can subsist on one diet and one diet alone and that is the milk coming from the mother cow. The father has no money to buy the milk since the hoarders have got a tight control over the money like in Germany and here comes a Hitler and he gets mad. He does not like the hoarding business. The child suffers. The mama cries, papa has no money, and child dies without milk. What a shame! If you had great love for the souls and the proper understanding, no one will do such acts where others have to suffer due to the hoarders. According to the Vedic descriptions, their (the hoarders) soulsí transmigrate to the bodies of mice and rats. They talk about Hitler as their enemy but according to Godís perfect arrangements, they have to hide constantly out of fears from cats, dogs, snakes and even from good humans if they happen to enter into their houses. They have to install mouse traps. So either way, they are not spared. Lord Krishn speaks: ìI am the Father, Mother and Maintainer and Grandsire of this universe.

It is time to examine with peace and patience that you all may have been tuned to some ignorant beliefs - some good but majority of them are self destructive in nature. It is not a question of my religion and your religion. It is a question of what is right for all the souls and the one which is absolutely harmonious and universal, not the Jehovahís examples: on such and such day Israelites will cut the heads of rams, bulls, goats, etc. and their blood must be sprinkled on the door post and this way Jehovah can make a distinction between the Israelites and the Egyptians and this way Jehovah job will be easier to kill the firstborn among the Egyptians. The man who wrote this stupid ideas as contained in the worldís most ignorant book must be a war hungry sick man. That is the single most reason for the present day society to live into the darkest regions where constant fears of murders and rapes are around. It is the time for the safety of the society, to cultivate harmony and love among souls, and to build up good family morals and values, one must get away from the Holy Landís Holy Book derived from the Middle East desert.

It is said that a good swimmer can easily cross the rivers, ponds and lakes but when it comes to the crossing of an ocean like the Atlantic, one must need the outside help, a solid boat; in the same scenario, in order to cross the miseries of the material ocean, one must need the purest and the highest understanding as spoken in BHAGAVAD GITA by the Almighty Himself, Sri Krishn.

Why someone goes to hell and someone goes to heaven? Is it automatic? No one is in between you and the Almighty. Only a prostituted mind requires a pimp in between her and the Almighty. Since the prostitute is interested in prostituting the society, her easy answer is to have the pimp in between. A sane person does not require a pimp in between him and the Almighty. He needs a teacher to guide the souls in the positive directions in order to go back to Godhead. The teacher (the Guru ) does not say that one can only go through him to Almighty. He is not a door-blocker. He is just giving the directions ñ just like his Guru has instructed to him and so on ñ in other words the knowledge has come down in succession. The Christian world has manufactured, the so- called, an easy answer without any kind of proper understanding that Jesus is their savior, the caretaker of all the born Christians or to be born or in between, automatically, regardless of their prostituted minds.

Now here the historical difficulty is in one aspect much greater than regards the empty tomb. THERE IS UNDOUBTEDLY A DIFFICULTY IN HARMONIZING THE NARRATIVES IN PARTICULAR. THE RELATION BETWEEN THE APPEARANCES IN GALILEE AND THOSE AT JERUSALEM. It is difficult to be quite clear as to the movements of the disciples.î ... (Page 260). ìWhat St. Mark originally contained, we do not know, the present ending is a latter summary. St. Matthew gives a Galleon appearance. St. Luke has formed a clear idea of how the Gospel arose in Jerusalem. He confines the appearances entirely to that city and he ignores if he does not entirely neglect that possibility of any thing having happened in Galilee. St. John in the Gospel gives us an exact account of appearances at Jerusalem and in the appendix of events in Galilee. IF YOU TAKE AWAY THE RESURRECTION, YOU CANNOT ACCOUNT FOR THE PREACHING OF THE GOSPELS.î .. . (Page 261. ëMiracles of the New Testamentí by Dr. D.D. Headlam.) Though the miracle is mentioned in all the Gospels, there are innumerable and irreconcilable discrepancies as well as contradiction in their accounts which may briefly be stated as follows: (1) The Gospels differ as to the number of women, John mentions only one Mary Magdalen. Matthew two, Mary Magdalen and the other Mary. Mark, three - the two Marys , and Salome; Luke several. the two Marys, Johanna and certain other with them.

According to Matt. and Mark, they assented the Resurrection of Jesus and his departure into Galilee and sent a message to his disciples enjoining upon them to follow him thither. According to Luke, they simply state that he was risen. According to John they only asked Mary, ìWomen, why weepiest thou.?î (4) According to Matthew, Luke, John, the women carried the information as to what they had seen at once to the disciples. According to Mark ëthey said nothing to any manî. (5) They differ as to the parties to whom Jesus appeared. According to Mark , it was one, according to Matthew, it was first two women, then to the eleven. According to John , it was first to one woman, then twice to the assembled apostles. According to Luke, it was first to no woman but to Cleopas and his companion, then to Peter and to the assembled eleven. (6) They differ as to the locality. According to Mark, it was no where. According to Matthew, it was first at Jerusalem and then at Galilee, where the disciples went in obedience to the angelic command. According to the Luke, it was Jerusalem and its neighborhood and there alone. According to the genuine part of John also the appearances were confined to Jerusalem. With these discrepancies it is clear that irreconcilable that one canít rely upon the account of Jesusí Resurrection as given in the Gospels. All the accounts agree that the women on their visit to sepulcher (burial place) found the body gone and saw someone in white robes who spoke to them. They agree only in this and nowhere else. These three facts namely: (i) That body was gone;"},{"pageNumber":533,"pageContent":"The Ultimate Guide for One World Order 487 (ii) That a figure dressed in white told the women that their lord was risen, (iii) and that the same women saw someone whom they believed to be Jesus ñ were quite sufficient to make a belief in the resurrection of Jesus spread with force and rapidly in the excited state of mind of all the disciples. BEFORE GIVING THE MOST REASONABLE AND NATURAL EXPLANATION OF THE HAPPENING, IT MAY BE NOTED IN THIS CONNECTION THAT EVEN JESUSí OWN DISCIPLES DID NOT BELIEVE IN THE WORDS OF WOMEN WHEN THEY TOLD THEM ABOUT THE RESURRECTION OF THEIR LORD. IN LUKE 24/11 : ìTHESE (WOMENíS) WORDS SEEMED TO THEM (DISCIPLES) AS IDLE TALES AND THEY BELIEVED THEM NOTî. ìBut their eyes were holden that they should not know him.î .. Luke 24/15. In Luke 24/15 , Jesus taking his disciples to task saying ìO fools and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken.î In Luke 24/41 , ìThey (disciples) yet believed notî. In all the Gospels it is being said over and over again that his disciples did not recognize Jesus after the spread of rumors of his resurrection those women. Can one believe that even those who were closely associated with him for a number of years as his very close intimate companions could not recognize him? Mary Magdalen took Jesus for a gardener and the same was the case with others. It is also noteworthy that in the Epistles of Peter, James, John and Jude, there is no mention of the resurrection of Jesus, they are said to be the eye witnesses of this wonder feast of an event.

One of the major cases took place was in George Town, Guinea, where Jim Jones gave poison to the entire congregation with the hope of rising to heaven - similar to Jesus resurrection. There are significant contradictions and differences in the Gospels account, should we then brush away the story of resurrection altogether, calling it a ìfraudî or ìmythî? The fact is that in spite of so many discrepancies in the Gospel narratives, we will not be justified in brushing aside the whole story in a sweeping manner.

And suddenly they cried out, saying, ìWhat have we to do with you, Jesus, you son of God? Have you come here to torment us before the time?î Now a good way off from them there was a herd of many swine (pigs) feeding. So the demons begged Jesus, saying, ìIf you cast us out, permit us to go away into the herd of swine.î And he said to them, ìGo.î So when they had come out, they went into the herd of swine, and behold, the whole herd of swing ( according to Mark 5:13), they were 2,000 in number) ran violently down the steep place into the sea, and perished in the water.î ...

The genealogy of the father (Joseph) and the real son (Jesus) are the same. If Jesus was not the real son of Joseph, the genealogy of Joseph could not be the genealogy of Jesus. In the Bibleís Chapter Luke 2:40-43 , ìHis (Jesus) parents went to Jerusalem.î Luke 2:33 , ìHis (Jesus) father and his mother marveled at those things which were spoken of him.î Luke, Chapter 2:48, ìHis (Jesus) mother said to him, ìSon, why have you done this to us?

So to begin, letís start with the wedding at Cana where ì . . . the mother of Jesus was there. And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage. And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him. They have no wine. Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? Mine hour is not yet come. His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it. And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece. Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.. When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was, but the servants which drew the water knew, the governor of the feast called the bridegroom, and saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: but thou has kept the good wine until now,î (John 2:1-10). Now ì . . . six waterpots..containing two or three firkins apiece . . . î would represent between one hundred and fifty to two hundred gallons of wine. Considering that this was all in addition to the good wine which had already been drunk, it suggests either a huge wedding party, or a lot of wine being drunk by the party. In fact, if each guest consumed only 8 oz. of the additional wine, about three thousand guests could have been accommodated. If they had already consumed as much of the original ì.. good wine . . . î, then the several thousand guests had drunk enough combined wine to become very much inebriated indeed."},{"pageNumber":539,"pageContent":"The Ultimate Guide for One World Order 493 JESUS - A WINEBIBBER Did Jesus himself drink? Well, we read that Jesus admits thatî . . . the son of man came eating and drinking, and they say Behold a man gluttonous, and a winebibber . . . ,î ( Matthew 11;19); and the similar ìThe son of man is come eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold a gluttonous man, and a winebibber.î (Luke 7:34) . And Jesusí twelve followers were thought to be drunk on that occasion that Peter had to come to their defense with the admission thatî .. For these are not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the day . . . î (Acts 2:14-15). The ëthird hourí would have been nine oíclock in the morning and altogether too early to be ëdrunkení. There is a strong suggestion that drinking was encouraged among the followers. This is found in the open invitation to engage in any number of possible sins in ìMy brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations..î (James 1:2 ) This was a proposition to test their faith. Perhaps most startling however, was the admission in the Gospel of Luke that ìNo man also having drunk old wine straightway desireth new; for the saith, The old is better.î (Luke 5:39) . JESUSí BLOOD IS COMMUNION WINE: There was also a cultic function and purpose for wine in Jesusí ministry. It is repeated throughout the four Gospels and involves drinking wine that represents the blood of the Messiah. For example ìAnd he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it; For this is my blood of the New Testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins. But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Fatherís kingdom . . . î (Matthew 26:27-29) and the very similar Mark 14:23-24 and Luke 22:17-20)."},{"pageNumber":540,"pageContent":"Hrsikes Das Mitriya 494 Although of similar intent, the event is recorded quite differently in the fourth Gospel. ìThen Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, except ye eat the flesh of the son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you. Whoso eateth my flesh, and drink my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day. For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed. He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him. These things said he in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.î (John 6:53-59) . (RESULTS: THERE ARE MORE THAN 43 MILLION CHRONIC ALCOHOLICS IN THE USA. 1 OUT OF 6 PEOPLE OF THE ENTIRE US POPULATION) WAS JESUS A HOMOSEXUAL? But, to the point, was Jesus a homosexual? We can let his (Biblical) actions speak for themselves, in lieu of simple speculation. And a point from which to begin a closer examination of Jesusí own action would be the incident between Jesus and the ënaked young maní. This episode occurs during and after Jesusí night spent in the garden of Gethsemane. One observer reports that Jesus was accompanied by ì.. an angel unto him from heaven . . . and Jesus sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.î (Luke 22:43-44). What was the observer actually viewing? He clearly observed two males engaged in some sort of rigorous physical and emotional activity. There was sweat and/or blood. What happens next provides one answer. And so, upon Jesus leaving the garden, ì. there followed him a certain young man, having a linen cloth cast about his naked body; and the young man laid hold of him: And he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked.î (Mark 14:51-52). Was this the companion that Luke observed with Jesus inside the garden? Certainly a very suggestive passage, and not Jesusí first encounter with ì . . . naked young men . . . î."},{"pageNumber":541,"pageContent":"The Ultimate Guide for One World Order 495 Further insight into the episode of the naked young man can be found by referring back to one of Messianic prophesies foretelling Jesus Christ. And the applicable prophesy is contained in ì. he that is courageous among mighty shall flee away naked on that day . . . î ( Amos 2:16 óthe Hebrew ëlababí translated ëcourageousí here, actually means ëtransported with loveí, and also ëravishedí). Now that certainly fits this episode of the young man fleeing away naked from Jesus outside the garden of Gethsemane. It is also useful to turn to an extra Biblical account to gain further insight into this garden of Gethsamane episode. It turns out that very similar images are presented in the ìSecret Gospel of Markî, known from early Church father, Clement of Alexandriaís (150-230 A.D.) letter to Theodorus which contains excerpts. Among those excerpts are the following ì . . . the young man, looking at Jesus, loved him and began to beseech him that he might be with him. They went into the house of the young man, for he was rich. And the young man, looking at Jesus, loved him . . . and after six days Jesus gave him an order; and when the evening had come, the young man went to him, dressed with a linen cloth over his naked body. And he remained with him that night, because Jesus taught him the mystery of the kingdom of God.î (Secret Gospel of Mark). Certainly a very suggestive passage, it was inserted in the canon of the orthodox Alexandrian Church of Egypt. Some scholars would insert the passage after canonical Mark 10:34. Who was this young man if not perhaps the rich man whom ìThen Jesus beholding him loved him . . . î (Mark 10:21). Perhaps it was the rich man Lazarus, of whom ì. he saith unto them, Our friend Lazarus sleepeth. ì (John 11:11) ó The Greek ëphilosí translated ëfriendí, also means ëdearí and ëfond ofí). Upon Lazarusí death, ìJesus wept. And said the Jews, Behold how he loved him!î (John 11:35-36). Or perhaps it wasî. Jesus therefore saw . . . the disciple standing by, whom he loved . . . î (John 19:26). Or perhaps it was him to whom ì. she runneth, and cometh to Simon Peter and to the other disciple,"},{"pageNumber":542,"pageContent":"Hrsikes Das Mitriya 496 whom Jesus loved . . . î (John 20:2 ) Or perhaps it was him who, while out fishing, ì...that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is the Lord.î (John 21:7) . Or perhaps it was him who later, when ìPeter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following; which also leaned on his breast at supper . . . î ( John 21:20 ó the Greek word ëanapipto í translated ëleanedí, means to ëfall oní and to ëembraceí). In all the above instances, the ëloveí is translated from both the Greek ëphileoí and the Greek ë agapao í, both of which carry the meaning of ëpersonal affectioní and are sometimes used to suggest ëintimate loveí, and even ëto kissí. Another mode of affection that Jesus engaged in with his male friends is found ìNow there was leaning on Jesusí bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved.î ( John 13:23 óthe Greek word ëanakeimaií translated ëleaningí, also means ëreclineí and ëout-stretchedî). Several passages later again ìHe then lying on Jesusí breast said unto him Lord, who is it? ( John 13:25 óthe Greek word ëepipipto í translated ëlyingí also means ëembrace with affectioní). A very intimate portrait begins to emerge of Jesusí close physical contact with certain male friends. They are seen ì..stretched out...î, and ì...in close embrace...î, and ì... lying together...î, and ì...kissing...î, and affectionately (and publicly) displaying their ëphileoí and ë agapaoí for each other.

SEXUALLY INTIMATE GOD God is often portrayed as having an intimate relationship with select individuals and with the whole Israelite people and nation. In these instances of metaphoric intimacy, God is usually portrayed as masculine, and his object as either masculine or feminine. For example ìArt not thou our God, who didst drive our the inhabitants of this land before thy people Israel, and"},{"pageNumber":543,"pageContent":"The Ultimate Guide for One World Order 497 givest it to the seed of Abraham thy friend for ever?î (2 Chronicles 20:7 ó the Hebrew word ëahabí translated ëfriendí means ëloverí and sexual affectioní). Yahweh proclaims his love for Davidís newborn son Solomon and ì . . . he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called his name Jedidiah . . . î (2 Samuel 12:24-25). Jedidiah means ëYahwehís darlingî. The sexual imagery is almost overwhelming of the supposed male God being utterly taken with the male human being. This image is reinforced in ìNow will I sing to my well- beloved a song of my beloved touching his vineyard. My well beloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill . . . î ( Isaiah 5:1 ó the Hebrew ëdodhí translated ëbelovedí, actually is an epithet for the male Yahweh here). The very erotic, yet allegorical, image presented is one of two male lovers, Isaiah and Yahweh, singing about the nation Israel. Another very homeo-erotic illustration is contained in the figurative image depicting ì.. as the girdle cleaveth in the loins of a man, so have I caused to cleave unto me the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah, saith the Lord . . . î (Jeremiah 13:11). The Hebrew word ëmothen í translated ëloinsí, means ëpubicí or ëgenitalí area. A very homosexual relationship surfaces in the metaphoric marriage relationship between Yahweh and the Israelite people. It is revealed in ì..thou hast destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee.î (Psalms 73:27 ó the Hebrew ëgol-zoneh mimeka í translated ëwhoringí, is in the masculine gender and evolves male parties). Similar is ì..thy sons go a whoring after their other gods . . . : (Exodus 34:16), and ìSurely as a wife treacherously departeth from her husband, so have ye dealt treacherously with me. O house of Israel, saith the Lord .î ( Jeremiah 3:20) ; and ì...Israel hast gone a whoring from thy God . . . î ( Hosea 9:1 ); and ì...but they went whoring after other gods . . . î ( Judges 2:17 ); and ì..they went a whoring after the gods of the people of the landî ( 1 Chronicles 5:25 )."},{"pageNumber":544,"pageContent":"Hrsikes Das Mitriya 498 Similar homosexual imagery can be found throughout the Bible. Although metaphoric and allegorical, masculine gender is applied in these instances to both parties, the Israelite nation and their god, Yahweh. To reinforce the image, Israel is even sometimes called ì..thus saith the Lord, Israel is my son, even my firstborn . . . î ( Exodus 4:22 ), and the related ìWhen Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt.î ( Hoses 11:1 ó the Hebrew ë ahabí translated ëlovedí, means ësexual affectioní). In the last instance, metaphorical incest and homosexuality are combined in Godís sexual relationship with his ësoní, the nation Israel. Whereas the above instances reveal intimate and sexual relations between figurative male entities, another side is also detected on occasion. For example, in the passage ìFor thy Maker is thine, husband . . . î ( Isaiah 54:5 ), Zion is feminine and God is masculine. The sexual relationship is heterosexual in the particular instance. This reinforces the image of a (at best) bisexual Biblical God. A CANNIBAL GOD Even Yahweh himself gets into the spirit of things when he threatens ìI will rend the fat of their hearts and thus will I devour (the Israelites) like a lion, as a wild beast will I rend themî (Hoses 13:8) . One might wonder whether we have a carnivorous God here, or is this just more barbaric allegory? We can obtain a better measure of the bestial Biblical God when we read ìThou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine anger; and Lord shall swallow them up in his wrath, and the fire shall devour them.î ( Psalms 21-9 ); and ìGod brought him forth out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn: he shall eat up the nations his enemies, and shall break their bones, and pierce them through with his arrows.î ( Numbers 24:8 ); and ìI have long time holden my peace; I have been still, and refrained myself: now will I cry like a travailing woman; I will destroy and devour at once.î ( Isaiah 42-14 )."},{"pageNumber":545,"pageContent":"The Ultimate Guide for One World Order 499 Never letting up, even Godís (symbolic) sword will consume flesh according to ìI will make mine arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall devour flesh; and that with the blood of the slain and of the captives, from the beginning of revenges upon the enemy ì( Deuteronomy 32:42 ); and ìThe spoilers are come upon all high places through the wilderness: for the sword of the Lord shall devour from the one end of the land even to the other end of the land: no flesh shall have peace.î ( Jeremiah 12:12 ). The Hebrew word ëcherebí translated ëswordí can also mean a ëdestructive forceî. NOAH, THE BIBLEíS HERO, GETS DRUNK AND EXPOSES HIMSELF, AND HAM, THE SON OF NOAH SAW THE NAKEDNESS; THE PATRIARCHS : The next recorded instance of (possible) means in the Bible revolves around the incident outline when Noah.î.. Was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent. And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father . . . And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done unto him. And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren.î ( Genesis 9-21-25 ). A terrible curse for merely glimpsing the drunken and uncovered Noah! But what is really going on here? Most Bible commentaries agree that a more serious defilement or desecration occurred than what is outlined in the passage themselves. In the first place, the Hebrew ë raah erwat í, translated ësaw the nakednessí, actually means ëhad sexual intercourseí. The Hebrew word ë galahí , translated ëuncoveredí, is also a euphemism for ësexual intercourseí. But, if Ham had in fact sodomize his father, why does Noah curse Hamís son Canaan, and not Ham or Hamís other three sons? The most likely explanation of the many proffered through the centuries, has it that Ham had sexual intercourse with Noahís wife (Hamís own mother!), and father Canaan. The possible incestuous pairing produced the bastard and inbred son, Canaan. It would be appropriate then for Noah to curse only Canaan in such circumstances."},{"pageNumber":546,"pageContent":"Hrsikes Das Mitriya 500 INCEST BECOMES COMMON One of the best-known instances of incest in the King James Bible is likely the case of Lot and his two daughters. The story begins ì... the angels urged Lot saying Arise take thy wife and thy two daughters..lest they be consumed in Sodom and Gomorrah... and he brought them forth and set them outside the cities...The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered Zoar. Then the Lord rained upon Sodom and Gomorrah fire and brimstone; but his wife looked back and became a pillar of salt...And Lot went up out of Zoar...and he dwelt in a cave with his two daughters. And the firstborn said unto the other...Come let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father...and the firstborn went in and lay with her father...and the younger rose, and lay with him. Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.î ( Genesis 19:12-38 ). Recalling that Lot was known as ì..just.. and that righteous man . . . his righteous soul...the Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptation . . . î ( 2 Peter 2:7-9 ), one might wonder about his incestuous relations with both his daughters. It is sometimes suggested that the story has the aetiological purpose of disparaging the Moabites and the Ammonites. For you see, the children that Lot fathered with his two daughters, were named Moab and Ammon. With all the incestuous pairing going on throughout the Bible, it is perhaps no wonder that relationship confusion occurs, as in ì..they took Lot, Abrahamís brotherís son..î ( Genesis 14:12) ; contradicting ì..(Abraham) brought again his brother Lot..î ( Genesis 14:16 ). So was Lot Abrahamís brother, or his nephew? Take your pick, the Bible has it both ways."},{"pageNumber":547,"pageContent":"The Ultimate Guide for One World Order 501 INCEST IN THE NEW TESTAMENT It turns out that Herod Antipas was involved in either a Levirate marriage or a incestuous relationship. We find that ì..he bound John in prison for Heroidas sake, his brother Philipís wife; for he had married her. For John had said unto Herod, it is not lawful for thee to have thy brotherís wife.î ( Matthew 14:3- 4, Mark 6:17-18, and Luke 3:19 ). It appears that John the Baptistís ignorance of the Torah was the basis for the trouble in which he found himself. His charge against Herod Antipas was without basis under the law. After all, Herod Antipas and Herod Philip were step (or half) brothers. Therefore, there was no technical violation of the provisions of the incest laws of either Leviticus Chapter 18 and 20. In the event Herod Philip had already died at the time, Herod Antipas was obliged to marry Herodias under Levirate law. If Herodias was a divorcee, there was still no problem as far as her remarrying Herod Antipas. Again, divorce was legal under the law of Moses. Herod Antipas had already put away his first wife at the time and was therefore eligible for remarriage himself. It appeared that John the Baptist had put his foot in his mouth by charging Herod Antipas with violating the laws. John didnít know what he was talking about, in other words. And that cost him his head. FIGURATIVE CANNIBALISM Human cannibalism in the Bible is so widespread and common that it becomes a useful and easily appreciated figurative expression as in ì..your leader who pluck of your skin from off you, and your flesh from off your bones, who also eat the flesh of my people, and flay the skin from off them; and break their bones, and chop them in pieces for the pot, and as flesh for the caldron.î ( Michah 3:1-3 ). Similarly, we read ìThere is a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst thereof, like a roaring lion ravening the prey; they have"},{"pageNumber":548,"pageContent":"Hrsikes Das Mitriya 502 devoured souls . . . Her priests have violated my law, and have profaned mine holy things: they have put no difference between the holy and profane, neither have they showed difference between the unclean and the clean . . . Her princes in the midst thereof are like wolves ravening the prey, to shed blood, and to destroy souls.î ( Ezekiel 22:25-27 ). The Hebrew word ëtarapt í translated ëraveningí also means to ëeatí, ëdevourí, and ëtear to pieces.î It is also found in Davidís lament that ìThey gaped upon me with their mouths, as ravening and a roaring lion.î ... ( Psalms 22:13 ). Another instance of figurative human cannibalism would include ìAnd the house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau for stubble, and they shall kindle in them, and devour them; and there shall not be any remaining of the house of Esau; for the Lord hath spoken it.î ... ( Obadiah 1:18 ). The Hebrew word ë akalí translated ëdevourí means ëdineí, eat and ëfeed with foodí. This word, ëdevourí is a very popular idiom throughout the Bible to suggest the ëeatingí of others. It is found early-on describing the bandit-like ìBenjamin shall ravin as a wolf: in the morning he shall devour the prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil.î ... ( Genesis 49:27 ). Other typical occurrences include ì..let fire come out from Abimelech, and devour the men of Shechem, and the house of Millo; and let fire come out from the men of Shechem, and from the house of Millo, and devour Abimelech.î ... ( Judges 9:20 ); and ìThere is a generation, whose teeth are as swords, and their jaw teeth as knives, to devour the poor from off the earth, and the needy from among men.î ... ( Proverbs 30:14 ) and ìThe Syrians before, and the Philistines behind; and they shall devour Israel with open mouth . . . î ... ( Isaiah 9:12) ; and ìLord, when thy hand is lifted up, they will not see: but they shall see, and be ashamed for their envy at the people; yea, the fire of thine enemies shall devour them.î ...

( Jeremiah 46:10-14 ). CANNIBALISM IN THE NEW TESTAMENT Most people would be familiar with the cannibalism theme used repeatedly within the King James Bible, by the Christian god, Jesus Christ, to describe his redemptive powers. Typical would be ìI am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh . . . Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you. Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hast eternal life . . . For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed. He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him . . . so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me.î ... ( John 6:51-58 ). Much the same is stated in ìAnd as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body. And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it; For this is my blood of the New Testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.î ... ( Matthew 26:28, Mark 14:22- 24, Luke 22:17-20, 1 Corinthians 10:16-17 and 11:23-30 and Hebrews 9:12-22 ). Cannibalism to secure eternal life.

[This must be falsified in many instances, for many saints fall from grace. Judas himself partook of the mystic flesh and blood, Paul says that it is impossible for fallen saints to renew their repentance. ( Hebrew 6:4-6 :) For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost, And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come. If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame.] CANNIBALISM IN REVELATION And in the Book of Revelation is found the prediction. ì.. these shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh . . . î ( Revelation 17:16 ). Things get no better in ì...the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born.î ... ( Revelation 12:3 ). DRINKING BLOOD As an adjunct to human cannibalism, drinking other peopleís blood figures prominently in the King James Bible too. For example, drinking an enemiesí blood is glorified inî .. the people shall rise up as a great lion..to eat of the prey and drink the blood of the slain enemy.î ... ( Numbers 23:24 ); and ì. they shall drink (thy enemiesí) blood as though wine.î ... ( Zechariah 9; 15 ). God himself will participate and partake of the drinking of human blood in ìFor this is the day of the Lord God of hosts, a day of vengeance, that he many avenge him of his adversaries: and the sword shall devour; and it shall be satiated and made drunk with their blood: for the Lord God of hosts hath a sacrifice"},{"pageNumber":551,"pageContent":"The Ultimate Guide for One World Order 505 in the north country by the river Euphrates.î ... ( Jeremiah 46:10 ). The Book of Revelation is a treasure chest of perverted earthy images, and drinking of human blood appears in several passages. Typical are ìThey have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and thou hast given them blood to drink, for they are worthy.î ... ( Revelation 16:6 ) A slightly different image appears in ìI saw the woman drunk with the blood of the saints and with the blood of the martyrs.î ... ( Revelation 17:6 ); and ì..in her was found the blood of prophets, saints, and all that were slain.î ... ( Revelation 18:24 ). The blood thirstiness found throughout the King James Bible is well grounded in the sentiment and proviso that ì . . . almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.î ... ( Hebrews 9:22 ). This sentiment has its roots in the much earlier ìFor the life of the flesh is in the blood; and I have given it to you upon the altar to make and atonement for your souls: for it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul.î ... ( Leviticus 17:11 ). The spilling and consumption of human blood then are part of the inherent doctrine of atonement and redemption found throughout the Bible. Some typical passages that support and reinforce the concept include ìBut if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanseth us from all sin.î ... ( 1 John 1:7 ); and ì..Jesus Christ.

After a difficult and dangerous journey, the brave navigator and his intrepid crew landed on the island of San Salvador on October 12, 1491.

Scholar Ivan Van Sertima , in ëThey Came Before Columbus í, documents that Africans and people from India had accomplished this voyage by 700 BC, traveling to the southern coast of Mexico. Influences of Africa and India can be seen in agricultural technologies, mound-building, and even in the structure of some Native American languages. The myth of Columbusís discovery is also based on the erroneous idea that fifteenth century Europeans believed that the world was flat. But the historical fact is that nearly all learned Europeans of the 1400s knew that the world was indeed round, and that uncharted lands were located in the west. Columbusís chief pilot and business partner, Martin Olonzo Pinzon, had found documents in the library of Pope Innocent VIII, which confirmed territories the west of Atlantic Ocean. What motivated Columbus and the Spanish conquistadors was the lure of gold and the possibility of exploiting the people and resources of these new lands. Within several decades, the Spanish initiated a series of repressive laws which in effect enslaved millions of Native Americans in a system of forced labor. ìCivilizationî meant the destruction of indigenous cultures and societies. When the Indians resisted, the Europeans showed no mercy. In the Mayan revolt in the Yucatan in the 1520s, Indian chiefs were burned alive; the arms and legs of captured warriors were cut off; Indian women by the thousands were raped and lynched. In one century, Mexicoís total population of 25 million declined to one million. The exploitation of the Americans requires a large labor force, so Europe turned to Africa. As early as the 1460s, about one thousand Africans were imported annually into the Iberian peninsula as slaves. The Catholic Church was prepared to sanction the expansion of the slave trade to the Americas. In 1498, Pope Innocent VIII accepted one hundred Moors as his own personal slaves as a gift from the Spanish King Ferdinand. In 1517, Bishop Bartholome de Las Casas urged the importation of twelve African slaves for every white Spanish settler.

This figure does not include the millions who perished in the transatlantic crossing, he notorious ëMiddle Passageí, in which their bodies were hurled overboard. Nor does it account for the millions of miles which were divided, the children torn away from their parents, the daughters sexually molested before their mothers and fathers. Slavery required the development of an ideology of domination. It was inevitable that Africa ceased to be described by their languages or cultures, and only by the most superficial distinction which separated them from most Europeans ñ their skin color. ìBlacksî were defined by the boundaries of their skin. Conversely, the Europeans began to call themselves ìwhitesî, a racist term rooted in power, privilege and violence. By recognizing the genocide and slavery which was the real legacy of Columbus, we might begin to appreciate the dignity of Native American cultures, and the history of African people.

Slaves stowed on or beneath these shelves had a height of only about two and half feet between the beams of the ship and far less space under the beams. With a tonnage of 320, a length of 100 feet, and a width of 25 feet, the three-masted Brookes, based in Liverpool, England, was supposed to carry a slave complement of 454, according to a regulatory act passed by Great Britainís Parliament in 1788.

He said certain descriptions of the Vimanas seemed ìtoo detailed and technical in nature to be labeled as myth.î He cited various texts to show there were 32 secrets relating to the operation of Vimanas, some of which could be compared to modern day use of radar, solar energy and photography.

For instance, the Trigura Vimana mentioned in Vamanika Shastra was a large craft operated by ìMotive power generated by solar rays.î Dr. Pinotti said, adding its elongated form was surely such closer to that of a modern blimp.î ìAccording to Dr. Pinotti, the huge ë Shakuna Viman í, described in the text, ìmight be defined as a cross between a plane and a rocket of our time and its design mind remind of todayís space shuttle.î ìSurely it expresses the most complex and sophisticated aeronautical design among all the other descriptions of Vimanas mentioned in ìVAIMANIKA SHASTRAî, he said, He treatise ëVaimanika Shastra, as a man attempting to explain as advanced technology.î Dr. Pinotti who mad a exhaustive study of the history of Indian astronautics said another text, ë Samarangans Sutradhara, has 230 stanzas devoted to the principles of building Vimana and their use in peace and war.
