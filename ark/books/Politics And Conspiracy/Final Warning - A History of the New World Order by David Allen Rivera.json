more than a stir ring of curiosity within me. What you are holding in your hands is the culmination of 25 years worth of reading, research, writing and effort to make people aware of the grow ing danger around them. Back in 1978, I was given a cassette tape that had been recorded at the Open Door Church in Chambersburg, PA. The guest speaker was a gentleman by the name of John Todd. He identified himself as a former witch who was involved in a secret Order of the elite known as the I Iluminati, who had been controlling world events fo r over 200 years, and whose ultimate goal was to establish a o ne)world government. I was quite shaken after listening to this tape, because in hig h school and college, I had begun to delve heavily into the facts and circumstances surr ounding the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, and had come to the conc lusion that there indeed was a conspiracy to kill him. I believed that this plot h ad been so pervasive and all) encompassing that it reached into the highest level s of government. Now, here was a man who was elaborating on the existence of a group who had the power, means, and motive to carry out such an act. His tale was just so incredible, so unbelievable, t hat I couldn’t get it out of my mind. So, I began to research the I Iluminati, thinking I was going to easily disprove his wild claims. I also began to do some digging on Todd. It wasn’t long before I began to realize that the history that is being taught in public sch ool, and presented in the media, rarely reflects the accuracy of actual events. We are taug ht what they want us to know. Therefore we have grown up under the delusion of su ch misconception, that it has become inconceivable to believe anything other than what has been perceived as truth. I was unable to prove or disprove that Todd was who he said he was. However, I was able to document about 90% of what he said abou t the I Iluminati. As I continued my research, the deeper I got, and t he more disturbing it became. When I research something, I tend to have tunnel)vi sion so that my focus is so much on the subject, that I am totally immersed in it. This is very similar to what a Profiler does when they get into the mind of the criminal. So, wh en I discovered that this thing had been developing for so long, my initial reaction wa s to want to know why, and what the motive was. This would give me leads in any directi on I needed to go to search for evidence. When I sat in church as a child, and would hear wha t the Bible had to say about what was going to happen in the ‘last days,’ as out lined in Daniel, Ezekiel and Revelation, it was really hard to imagine how that all could be possible. But, I began to realize that prophecies made over 2,000 years ago w ere beginning to be fulfilled. I also realized that I could not approach this research fr om a physical standpoint, because it went far beyond a natural understanding. When you c onsider the spiritual foundation, then you can begin to comprehend what is now happen ing all around us. For six years, I spent hundreds of hours into findi ng out all I could concerning the I Iluminati. The result was a manuscript in 1984 titl ed The I Iluminati Conspiracy and the Coming One World Government . A Christian bookstore in the area agreed to sell copies of it as I began to contact a few companies in the hopes of getting it published on a larger scale. There was nothing available at the ti me which pulled together all the"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"different aspects into one reference source, so in that regard, it was a ground)breaking work. But alas, a first book, by a no)name writer, on a controversial subject, did not get any attention. The manuscript was filed away in a b ox. Then, in 1990, during the Persian Gulf crisis, Pres ident George Bush began talking about a ‘New World Order.’ I immediately saw the co nnection to the I Iluminati front organizations, and I began reworking the manuscript . I remember my wife standing in the doorway of my den saying: “You have been workin g on this book ever since I met you.” It was self)published in 1994 as Final Warning , and sold in nearly all the Christian bookstores in eight central Pennsylvania counties, by mail order, and through four national distributors. Again, I tried to get it published on a larger scal e. I contacted over a hundred publishers, and even with proven sales in my target area, which projected into national sales of over 48,000, there was only one publisher, Huntington House, who seriously considered it. After all the copies were sold, the manuscript was again filed away in a box. Between 1996 and 1998, I received some very profoun d spiritual revelation in regard to my destiny, and my reason for being. I began to operate and function with a new degree of insight and purpose. Early in 1998, I received a computer through Divine Providence, and on November 24, 1998 the book became available on my website, a nd since then has been copied onto other websites, linked to, downloaded, and pri nted by thousands of people. However, in mid)2003, many people began to request copies of the book. It is now 20 years since the initial ‘publication’ of Final Warning , and many people have begun to see the many changes that have occurr ed in that time. The world is indeed a very dangerous place. But it is by design, and it is with purpose. I have corrected some statistics, and added some ne w information in certain sections; but because of the space constraints, I d ecided not to completely update the book. Since much of the research was done between 1 978 and 1984, the book may come across as being dated. However, I would like t o remind the reader that this is a history book, and its focus is the origin and devel opment of the movement toward one) world government. In a sense, this book is a collection of files whic h provide a concise overview of the entire subject. Just as an attorney would do, I hav e taken it, pulled it apart, examined every piece, then put it all back together. The pur pose for this is to systematically and methodically build my case, and produce the evidenc e that will prove my contention. In addition, please understand that this is a refer ence work. One person, when he took it with him on vacation, expecting an easy rea d, likened it to a college textbook. Although, in reworking it, I have tried to change s ome of the dry language, rearrange, and edit some of the text, it is still a reference book. However, know that this incredible compilation of history and facts can not be found a nywhere, in any one book. The story that will unfold before your eyes will grab a hold of you and never let go. Come with me now on a trip to a not too distant pas t, and an uncertain future. It will be a journey of discovery and revelation. David Allen Rivera December, 2003"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"PREFACE ILLUSTRATED EDITION In February, 2004, after putting together a PowerPo int presentation for the Prophecy Club in Topeka, Kansas, I decided to take advantage of the time I spent compiling the pictures I needed. I inserted the pictures into the book to give people a better perspective on the information I was presenting so that they could relate better to it. For the next four months I diligently worked to do that, and what began to emerge was a fitting natural progression from a project wh ich began over 25 years before. With the book, and then the website, I began to get a se nse of closure that I have never felt before. As far as my wife was concerned, it was another pro ject. (She seems to think that I don’t know how to have fun, because I do nothing bu t work on things.) To my kids, it was something else that Dad had to do. Since 1978, thousands of hours have been committed to producing the information that you now have before you. It has been done at a tremendous cost, because I jeopardized the upb ringing of my children to pursue what I have perceived to be my destiny. Nevertheles s, right or wrong, most likely this research will be my legacy. As such, it is importan t to disseminate the information as effectively as possible. I have labeled this project as a “rogue” edition, b ecause I did not secure the permissions to reproduce any of the photographs whi ch appear here. I know it is wrong and I apologize. However, the additional time it wo uld have taken to procure the rights and permissions necessary to complete this project would have been incredible, and probably impossible. You need to understand that we , as a nation, are under attack from within. This is a war. In addition, it is not my intention to profit from this edition, but to make it freely available, just as I have done by posting the entire text of my book on my website, as well as allowing others to post it o n their websites. I am very appreciative for the work that people hav e done to stock the information highway (internet) with research and pictures, whic h made my work very fulfilling, because I was able to put together something which I think does justice to the subject. And now, I would like to introduce you to the “Men of the Pyramid.” Those individuals who have been responsible for transforming us from a free society, to a nation hellbent on relinquishing liberty in lieu of an oppressive r ule that will control every aspect of day) to)day life and lead to a one)world government. David Allen Rivera July, 2004 "},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION Since the Persian Gulf War, the term ‘New World Ord er’ has become well known. However, there has never really been an explanation as to what the term actually meant, only that it represented a new spirit of coo peration among the nations of the world, in order to further the cause of peace. And peace is good, so therefore the New World Order is good and should be accepted. Not so fast. Like the old saying, you can’t tell a book by its cover, there is more here than m eets the eye. In regard to the term, William Safire wrote in the New York Times in February, 1991: “Cit’s Bush’s baby, even if he shares its populariz ation with Gorbachev. Forget the Hitler ‘new order’ root; F.D.R. used the phrase ear lier.” The term ‘New World Order’ was actually first used many years ago. Nicholas Murray Butler In an address delivered to the Union League of Phil adelphia on November 27, 1915, Nicholas Murray Butler said: “The old world order c hanged when this war)storm broke. The old international order passed away as suddenly , as unexpectedly, and as completely as if it had been wiped out by a giganti c flood, by a great tempest, or by a volcanic eruption. The old world order died with th e setting of that day’s sun and a new world order is being born while I speak, with birth pangs so terrible that it seems almost incredible that life could come out of such fearful suffering and such overwhelming sorrow.” In a 1919 subscription letter for the magazine International Conciliation , M. C. Alexander, the Executive Secretary of the American Association for International Conciliation wrote: “The peace conference has assem bled. It will make the most momentous decisions in history, and upon these deci sions will rest the stability of the new world order and the future peace of the world.” "},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" Augustus O. Thomas In August, 1927, Dr. Augustus O. Thomas, President of the World Federation of Education Associations said: “If there are those who think we are to jump immedi ately into a new world order, actuated by complete understanding and brotherly lo ve, they are doomed to disappointment. If we are ever to approach that tim e, it will be after patient and persistent effort of long duration. The present int ernational situation of mistrust and fear can only be corrected by a formula of equa l status, continuously applied, to every phase of international contacts, until the cobwebs of the old order are brushed out of the minds of the people of all lands .” Adolf Hitler Adolf Hitler said: “National Socialism will use its own revolution for the establishing of a new world order.” In the 1932 book The New World Order , author F. S. Marvin said that the League of Nations was the first attempt at a New World Order, and said that “nationality must rank below the claims of mankind as a whole.”"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" Edward VIII Edward VIII became King of England on January 20, 1 936, but he was forced to abdicate the throne eleven months later, when he ma rried a commoner. He became the Duke of Windsor, and in July, 1940, became the gove rnor of the Bahamas. He is on record as saying: “Whatever happens, whatever the o utcome, a new Order is going to come into the world ... It will be buttressed with police power ... When peace comes this time there is going to be a new Order of social jus tice. It cannot be another Versailles.” In a New York Times article in October, 1940, called “New World Order Pledged to Jews,” comes the following excerpt: “In the first p ublic declaration on the Jewish question since the outbreak of the war, Arthur Gree nwood, member without portfolio in the British War Cabinet, assured the Jews of the Un ited States that when victory was achieved an effort would be made to found a new wor ld order based on the ideals of ‘justice and peace’.” The “Declaration of the Federation of the World,” w ritten by the Congress on World Federation, which was adopted by the Legislatures o f some states, including North Carolina (1941), New Jersey (1942), and Pennsylvani a (1943), said: “If totalitarianism wins this conflict, the world will be ruled by tyra nts, and individuals will be slaves. If democracy wins, the nations of the earth will be un ited in a commonwealth of free peoples; and individuals, wherever found, will be t he sovereign units of the new world order.” "},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" Sumner Welles From an article in a June, 1942 edition of the Philadelphia Inquirer : “Undersecretary of State Sumner Welles tonight called for the early creation of an international organization of anti)Axis nations to control the wo rld during the period between the armistice at the end of the present war and the set ting up of a new world order on a permanent basis.” Nelson Rockefeller According to a February, 1962 New York Times article called “Rockefeller Bids Free Lands Unite: Calls at Harvard for Drive to Build Ne w World Order,” New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller told an audience at Harvard Univ ersity: “The United Nations has not been able– nor can it be able– to shape a new world order which events so compellingly demand C (The new world order that will answer econ omic, military, and political problems) urgently requires, I believe, that the Un ited States take the leadership among all the free peoples to make the underlying concept s and aspirations of national sovereignty truly meaningful through the federal ap proach.” The Associated Press reported that on July 26, 1968, Governor Rockefelle r said in a speech to the International Platform Association at the Sheraton Park Hotel in New York, that “as"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"President, he would work toward international creat ion of a New World Order.” Richard M. Nixon Richard Nixon wrote in the October, 1967 issue of t he Council on Foreign Relation’s (CFR) journal Foreign Affairs : “The developing coherence of Asian regional think ing is reflected in a disposition to consider problems and loyalties in regional terms, and to evolve regional approaches to development needs and to the evolution of a new world order.” In 1972, while in China, in a toast to Chin ese Premier Chou En)lai, Nixon expressed “the hope that each of us has to build a new world order.” Richard Gardner Richard Gardner, former Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for International Organizations under Kennedy and Johnson, and a memb er of the Trilateral Commission, wrote in the April, 1974 issue of Foreign Affairs (pg. 558): “In short, the ‘house of world order’ will have to be built from t he bottom up rather than from the top down. It will look like a great ‘booming, buzzing c onfusion,’ to use William James’ famous description of reality, but an end run aroun d national sovereignty, eroding it piece by piece, will accomplish much more than the old fashioned frontal assault.” "},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" Richard Falk Richard A. Falk, wrote in his article “Toward a New World Order: Modest Methods and Drastic Visions” (from the 1975 book On the Creation of a Just World Order ): “The existing order is breaking down at a very rapid rat e, and the main uncertainty is whether mankind can exert a positive role in shaping a new world order or is doomed to await collapse in a passive posture. We believe a new wor ld order will be born no later than early in the next century and that the death throes of the old and the birth pangs of the new will be a testing time for the human species.” Majorie Holt In 1975, 32 Senators and 92 Representatives in Cong ress signed “A Declaration of Interdependence” (written by the historian Henry St eele Commager) which said that “we must join with others to bring forth a new world or derCNarrow notions of national sovereignty must not be permitted to curtail that o bligation.” Congresswoman Marjorie Holt, who refused to sign it, said: “It calls for t he surrender of our national sovereignty to international organizations.

Progress and peace and justice are attainable. So we say to all peoples an d governments: Let us fashion together a new world order.” Jimmy Carter During the 1976 Presidential campaign, Jimmy Carter said: “We must replace balance of power politics with world order politics .” In a February 14, 1977 speech, Carter said: “I want to assure you that the relatio ns of the United States with the other countries and peoples of the world will be guided d uring my own Administration by our desire to shape a world order that is more responsi ve to human aspirations. The United States will meet its obligation to help create a st able, just, and peaceful world order.” "},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":" Stanley Hoffman Harvard professor Stanley Hoffman wrote in his book Primacy or World Order : “What will have to take place is a gradual adaptation of the social, economic and political system of the United States to the imperatives of w orld order.” George Weigel Conservative author George Weigel, director of the Ethics and Public Policy Center in Washington, D.C. said: “If the United States doe s not unashamedly lay down the rules of world order and enforce them ... then ther e is little reason to think that peace, security, freedom or prosperity will be served.” "},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":" Mikhail Gorbachev In a December, 1988 speech, Mikhail Gorbachev told the United Nations: “Further global progress is now possible only through a ques t for universal consensus in the movement towards a new world order.” George H. W. Bush The man who put the New World Order in the limeligh t, and did more than anyone to bring about its acceptance, was President George Bu sh. In a February, 1990 fundraiser in San Francisco, Bush said: “Time and again in thi s century, the political map of the world was transformed. And in each instance, a New World Order came about through the advent of a new tyrant or the outbreak of a blo ody global war, or its end.” "},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"  Brent Scowcroft   James Bak er On Saturday, August 25, 1990, the United Nations Se curity Council voted unanimously to allow a joint military force to use whatever means necessary to enforce a UN blockade against the country of Iraq. That aft ernoon, Lt. Gen. Brent Scowcroft, a CFR member and former aide to Henry Kissinger, who was the National Security Advisor to Bush, was interviewed by Charles Bierbau er of the Cable News Network (CNN) and used the term “a New World Order.” In Aug ust, 1990, (According to an article in the Washington Post in May, 1991) he said: “We believe we are creatin g the beginning of a New World Order coming out of the co llapse of the U.S.)Soviet antagonisms.” During a September, 1990 speech at th e United Nations, he announced that “we are moving to a New World Order.” Later, o n the eve of the Gulf War, Scowcroft said: “A colossal event is upon us, the b irth of a New World Order.” In the fall of 1990, on the way to Brussels, Belgium, Secretary of State James Baker said: “If we really believe that there’s an opportunity here for a New World Order, and many of us believe that, we can’t start out by appeasing aggre ssion.” "},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":" Richard Gephardt In September, 1990, the Wall Street Journal quoted Rep. Richard Gephardt as saying: “We can see beyond the present shadows of w ar in the Middle East to a New World Order where the strong work together to deter and stop aggression. This was precisely Franklin Roosevelt’s and Winston Churchil l’s vision for peace for the post)war period.” In a September 11, 1990 televised address to a join t session of Congress, Bush said: “A new partnership of nations has begun. We stand t oday at a unique and extraordinary moment. The crisis in the Persian Gul f, as grave as it is, offers a rare opportunity to move toward an historic period of cooperation. Out of these troubled times, our fifth objective– a New World Or der– can emerge ... When we are successful, and we will be, we have a real chan ce at this New World Order, an order in which a credible United Nations can use its peacekeeping role to fulfill the promise and vision of the United Nations’ found ers.” The September 17, 1990 issue of Time magazine said that “the Bush administration would like to make the United Nations a cornerstone of its plans to construct a New World Order.” "},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":" Eduard Shevardnadze In a September 25, 1990 address to the UN, Soviet F oreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze described Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait as “an act of terrorism (that) has been perpetrated against the emerging New World Ord er.” In an October 1, 1990, UN address, President Bush t alked about the “Ccollective strength of the world community expressed by the UN C an historic movement towards a New World Order C a new partnership of nations C a time when humankind came into its own C to bring about a revolution of the s pirit and the mind and begin a journey into a C new age.” On October 30, 1990, Bush sugges ted that the UN could help create “a New World Order and a long era of peace.” Jeanne Kirkpatrick Jeanne Kirkpatrick, former U.S. Ambassador to the U N, said that one of the purposes for the Desert Storm operation, was to sho w to the world how a “reinvigorated United Nations could serve as a global policeman in the New World Order.” On December 31, 1990, Gorbachev said that the New W orld Order would be ushered in by the Gulf War.

A world in which there is a very real prospect of a New World Order. In the words of Winston Churchill, a ‘world order’ in which the ‘principles of justice and fair play ... protect the weak against the strong.’ A world where the United Nations, freed from cold war stalemate, is poised t o fulfill the historic vision of its founders. A world in which freedom and respect for human rights find a home among all nations.” Warren Christopher On August 21, 1991, after the failed coup in the So viet Union, CNN reporter Mary Tillotson said that the President’s “New World Orde r is back on track, now stronger than ever.” In an interview with CNN at the height of th e Gulf War, Scowcroft said that he had doubts about the significance of Mid)East objective s regarding global policy.

Change s like the ones which have, and are occurring do not take place overnight. We are d ealing with a group which must have been growing for a long period of time, in order to obtain the power and influence necessary to achieve the global control now being e xercised. When you think of it in that context, there is such a group. The I Iluminati. Adam Weishaupt The leader of the I Iluminati was a man named, Dr. Adam Weishaupt, who was born on February 6, 1748, the son of a Jewish rabbi. Whe n his father died in 1753, he was converted to Catholicism by Baron Johann Adam Ickst att, who turned the early training of the boy over to the Jesuits. Ickstatt, in 1742, had been appointed by the Jesuits to be the curator of the University in order to reorganiz e it. He had retired in 1765, but still controlled its policies. Although Weishaupt later became a priest, he develo ped a distinct hatred for the Jesuits, and became an atheist. Given access to the private library of Ickstatt, his godfather, the young man became interested in the w orks of the French philosophers, and studied law, economics, politics, and history. One such philosopher, Voltaire (1694) 1778), a revolutionary who held liberal religious v iews, had written in a letter to King Frederick II (‘the Great’, a Mason): “Lastly, when the whole body of the Church should be sufficiently weakened and infidelity strong enou gh, the final blow (is) to be dealt by the sword of open, relentless persecution. A reign of terror (is) to be spread over the whole earth, and C continue while a Christian shoul d be found obstinate enough to adhere to Christianity.” It is believed that Weisha upt got his ideas concerning the destruction of the Church from Voltaire’s writings. He studied in France, where he met"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Robespierre (who later led the French Revolution), and became friends with a few people in the French Royal Court. It is believed, t hat through these contacts, he was introduced to Satanism. He graduated from the Bavarian University in Ingols tadt, Germany in 1768. He served four years as a tutor until he was promoted to Assistant Instructor. In 1770, he was chosen by Mayer Amschel Rothschild to develop a n organization that he could use. In 1772, Weishaupt was made Professor of Civil Law. In 1773, he was made Professor of Canon Law, a post which had been held by the Jes uits for 90 years. They had founded most of the Universities, and kept strict c ontrol of them in order to eliminate Protestant influence. In 1773, Weishaupt got married, against the wishes of Ickstatt, who denounced him. Two years later, at the age of 27, he was made Dean of the Faculty of Law. The Jesuits, worried about his quick progression, tried to thwar t his influence by secretly plotting against him, and his liberal thinking. Not wanting to become a martyr for his free) thinking ideas, he began focusing on establishing h is organization. To confuse his detractors, he based the organizational structure o n the one used by the Jesuits, however, his intention was to have a secret coaliti on of liberalism. He studied the anti)Christian doctrines of the Mani cheans, whose teachings revolved around astrology, medicine, and magic. He had been indoctrinated into Egyptian occult practices by an unknown merchant named Kolmer, from Jutland (the area around the border of Denmark and West Germany), who had been t raveling around Europe since 1771. He studied the power of the Eleusinian myster ies and the influence exerted by the secret cult of the Pythagoreans. Pythagoras was a 6 th century B.C., philosopher who taught that men and women should combine their belo ngings– which became the basic philosophy behind Communism. Weishaupt also studied the teachings of the Essenes, and acquired copies of the Kabala , The Major Key of Solomon , and The Lesser Key of Solomon , which revealed how to conjure up demons and perfo rm occult rituals. He studied the various Masonic writings after meeti ng a Protestant Freemason from Hanover. At first he thought about creating a super ior Masonic)like organization that would be made up of men possessing superior abiliti es in all fields but concluded that Masonry was too open. Weishaupt was instructed by the Rothschilds (who we re also said to be Satanists), to leave the Catholic Church, and unite all the dif ferent occult groups. He created the coven known as the ‘Golden Dawn’ which, to this day , is alleged to be the Rothschilds’ private coven. Weishaupt spent five years working out a plan throu gh which all of his ideas could be reduced to a single system which would be used t o fight the oppression of religion, thereby loosening social ties. He wanted to replace Christianity with a religion of reason. An initial idea was to form an organization compris ed of ‘Schools of Wisdom,’ whose goal was to “make of the human race, one good and h appy family.” They were to strive for the perfection of morals, so he thought about n aming the group the ‘Perfectibilists,’ but it lacked the air of mystery and intrigue that he sought. In 1774, he published a fictitious article called Sidonii Apollinarus Fragment , which he said, was to prepare the people for the doctrine of reason. Weishaupt wrote: “Princes and nations will disappear without violence from th e earth. The human race will then become one family, and the world will be the dwelli ng of rational men.” He wrote of their"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"aims: “To make the perfecting of reasoning powers i nteresting to mankind, to spread the knowledge of sentiments, both humane and social, to check wicked inclinations, to stand up for suffering and oppressed virtue ... to facilitate the acquirement of knowledge and science.” On May 1, 1776, under the direction of the newly fo rmed House of Rothschild (and Wessely, Moses, Mendelssohn; and the Bankers, Itzig , Friedlander, and Meyer), who instigated the American Revolution to weaken Great Britain, Weishaupt founded the Ancient Illuminated Seers of Bavaria, which became known as the Order of the I Iluminati. Weishaupt said that the name was derived from Luciferian teachings, and means, ‘Holders of the Light.’ In Latin, it means, the ‘enlightened ones.’ In layman’s terms, it means ‘to illuminate,’ or ‘to give light. ’ It refers to someone who is enlightened, spiritually and intellectually. Satan, when he was an angel, was known as Lucifer, the ‘Bearer of Light,’ and being that the group’s name evolved from this, we can see the underlying nature of its goals. In addition, May 1s t was a great day for all communist nations, where it was known as May Day; and it is a lso known as a special day to witches. There were some earlier groups, with similar names, such as a group known as the ‘Illuminated Ones’ which was founded by Joachim of Floris in the 11th century, who taught a primitive, supposedly Christian doctrine o f “poverty and equality.” The Rosheniah, or ‘Illuminated Ones,’ (which was influe nced by an earlier group known as the Eastern Ismaelites, after Ismael, the son of Ja affer; Batiniyeh, ‘internal’ or ‘secret’; or just by their nickname, the ‘Assassins.’) was a gr oup in Afghanistan during the 16th century, who sought the ‘illumination’ from the Sup reme Being, who wanted a class of perfect men and women. After reaching the fourth de gree, ‘Enlightened One,’ the initiate would receive mystical powers, and when the eighth and final degree was reached, they were told they had achieved perfection. An Afghan s cholar said that their purpose was to influence people of importance to establish harm ony in the world, and were devoted to fight the tyranny of the Moguls, who were the ru lers of India. The group survived until the 1700’s. The Alumbrados (‘enlightened’ or ‘illuminated’) was a mysterious movement in Spain during the 16th and 17th centuries that believed th at when a person achieved a certain degree of perfection, they experienced a vision of God, and then entered into direct communication with the Holy Spirit. At this point t he soul would enter a state of limbo– not advancing or going back. Once this level was ac hieved, a person didn’t have to perform any good works or get involved in any relig ious activity, because they had received the ‘light.’ Once they had received the ‘l ight,’ they would possess superior human intelligence. Their members mainly came from reformed Franciscans , and the Jesuits. Their unusual claims caused them to be criticized and har assed, and the Inquisition issued Edicts against them in 1568, 1574, and 1623. Ignati us de Loyola, founder of the Jesuits, was put in jail for being a member. This condemnati on forced the movement into France, where in 1654 they surfaced as the Illumina ted Guerinets. The ‘ I Iluminati’ was the name of an occultic German sect that existed in the 15th century that professed to possess the ‘light’ recei ved from Satan. It was also the name of an organization that was influenced by the writi ngs of Emanuel Swedenborg, which was established in 1760 at Avignon. This Swedenborg ian philosophy also produced the"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Illuminated Theosophists in 1766 at Paris, then lat er in London, but was short lived. Although it would certainly make for a more interes ting story, there is no documentation to suggest that Weishaupt’s Order of the I Iluminati is a continuation of any of these groups. However, whether their teachin gs and philosophy had an influence on him is another question. Most assuredly, there i s a spiritual lineage that ties them all together.   Francis Dashwood  Alphonse DeSade Starting with only five members (Weishaupt, and his inner circle– his friend Kollmer, Francis Dashwood of the Satanic Hellfire Club, Alph onse Donatien DeSade from whose name we get the word “sadism,” and Meyer Amschel Ro thschild), the I Iluminati wasn’t fully operational until 1778. Weishaupt wrote: “The great strength of our Order l ies in its concealment, let it never appear, in any place in its own name, but always co vered by another name, and another occupation. None is fitter than the three l ower degrees of Freemasonry; the public is accustomed to it, expects little from it, and therefore takes little notice of it.” He also wrote: “For the Order wishes to be secret, and to work in silence, for thus it is better secured from the oppression of the ruling powers, a nd because this secrecy gives a greater zest to the whole.” The Order was made up of three degrees: Novice, Min erval, and Illuminated Minerval. It was organized in a manner similar to F reemasonry and the Jesuits. Even though he admired the structure of the Jesuit hiera rchy, he wrote that no ex)Jesuits were to be admitted, except by special permission. He wrote that they “must be avoided as the plague.” Their rites and ceremonies were sim ilar to that of the Masons. Their aim, he said, was to have a one)world government, to all ow the elite to govern the world, thus preventing future wars. One of their early pro grams was to distribute anti)religious material to criticize clerical leaders, who they sa w as obstacles to social progress, and to oppose the “enemies of the human race and of soc iety.” Weishaupt wrote: “How can the weak obtain protectio n? Only by union, but this is rare. Nothing can bring this about but hidden socie ties. Hidden schools of wisdom are the means which we will one day free men from their bonds...” All members were required to adopt classical names. Weishaupt was called"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"‘Spartacus’ (who had been the leader of the slave i nsurrection in ancient Rome). His right)hand man, Xavier von Zwack, a lawyer to Princ e von Salm, was known as ‘Cato’; Nicolai, the bookseller, was ‘Lucian’; Professor We stenreider was ‘Pythagoras’; Canon Hertel was ‘Marius’; Marquis di Constanza was ‘Diom edes’; Massenhausen was ‘Ajar’ Baron von Schroeckenstein was ‘Mohomed’; and Baron von Mengenhofen was ‘Sylla.’ Their headquarters was in Munich, Germany, and know n as the Grand Lodge of the I Iluminati (or Lodge of the Grand Orient)– code)name d ‘Athens.’ Among their other four lodges: Ingolstadt was known as ‘Ephesus,’ Heidelbe rg as ‘Utica,’ Bavaria as ‘Achaia,’ and Frankfurt was known as ‘Thebes.’ The calendar was reconstructed, and the months know n by names reminiscent of the Hebrew language: January was known as ‘Dimeh,’ and February as ‘Benmeh,’ etc. They dated their letters according to the Persian E ra, named after the king who began to rule in Persia in 632 B.C., Jezdegerd. Their new year began on March 21st, which some sources say is New Years Day for witches. In 1777, Weishaupt joined the Eclectic Masonic lodg e ‘Theodore of Good Counsel’ in Munich, and towards the end of 1778, he came up with the idea of merging the I Iluminati and the Masons. Zwack became a Mason on N ovember 27, 1778, and working with a brother Mason, Abbé Marotti, he divu lged the secret of the Order. By the middle of 1779, the Munich Masonic lodge was under the complete influence of the I Iluminati. During the first four years, about 60 active member s had been recruited by a committee known as the ‘Insinuators,’ and close to 1,000 had become indirectly affiliated with the Order. Soon, three more lodges were established. Few knew the supreme direction of the Order. Only t hose within the inner circle, known as the ‘Areopagite’ (meaning ‘Tribunal’), wer e aware of their true purpose. To all others, Weishaupt said that he wanted a one)world g overnment to prevent all future wars. Nesta Webster and her book World Revolution The book World Revolution (by Nesta Webster) stated: “The art of Illuminism lay in"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"enlisting dupes as well as adepts, and by encouragi ng the dreams of honest visionaries or the schemes of fanatics, by flattering the vanit y of ambitious egotists, by working on unbalanced brains, or by playing on such passions a s greed and power, to make men of totally divergent aims serve the secret purpose of the sect.” Foolish, naive people, with money to burn, were esp ecially welcomed. Weishaupt wrote: “These good people swell our numbers and fil l our money box; set yourselves to work; these gentlemen must be made to nibble at the bait ... But let us beware of telling them our secrets, this sort of people must always b e made to believe that the grade they have reached is the last.” Weishaupt explained : “One must speak sometimes in one way, sometimes in another, so that our real pur pose should remain impenetrable to our inferiors.” And what was that purpose? It was “ nothing less than to win power and riches, to undermine secular or religious governmen t, and to obtain the mastery of the world.” Initiates were told that the Order represented the highest ideals of the Church, that Christ was the first advocator of Illuminism, and h is secret mission was to restore to men the original liberty and equality they had lost in the Garden of Eden. Weishaupt said that Christ exhorted his disciples to despise riches in order to prepare the world for the community of goods that would do away with prop erty ownership. Weishaupt wrote to Zwack: “The most admirable thing of all is that great Protestant and reformed theologians (Lutherans and Calvinists) who belong to our Order really believe they see in it the true and genuine mind of the Christian religion.” However, when one of Weishaupt’s followers would reach the h igher degrees, their secret was revealed: “Behold our secret ... in order to destro y all Christianity, all religion, we have pretended to have the sole true religion ... to del iver one day the human race from all religion.” Women were also enlisted. He wrote: “There is no wa y of influencing men so powerful, as by means of women. These should theref ore be our chief study; we should insinuate ourselves into their good opinion, give t hem hints of emancipation from the tyranny of public opinion, and of standing up for t hemselves...” He also wrote: “This sex has a large part of the world in their hands.” Fema le members were divided into two groups: one group of society women, to give the org anization an air of respectability; and the other group “who would help to satisfy thos e brothers who have a penchant for pleasure.” The I Iluminati also used monetary and sex bribery to gai n control of men in high places, then blackmailed them with the threat of financial ruin, public exposure, and fear of death. Internal fighting soon developed because of Weishau pt’s thirst for power. Besides that, because only nominal dues were collected, the Order suffered financially. "},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":" Baron Franz Friedrich Knigge In 1780, a new member, Baron Franz Friedrich Knigge (1752)1796), was recruited, and given the pseudonym of ‘Philo.’ Knigge was born on October 16, 1752. He studied law at Gottingen, served in the courts of Hesse)Cas sel and Weimar, and was a well) known writer of romance, poetry and philosophy. He joined the Masonic lodge of Strict Observance, which was dedicated to the elimination of the occult sciences, which were widely practiced. Unable to do that, they were forc ed to accept it. Knigge achieved the rank of Brother Commander, and had the title of Kni ght of the Swan. He assisted in the establishment of a new Masonic lodge at Hanau. Beca use of his developing exposure and interest in the occult, magic and alchemy, he j oined the Rosicrucians, a secret organization that dated back to the fourteenth cent ury, and reportedly was an occult group who participated in human sacrifice rituals. He later renounced alchemy, and devoted his studies to the development of a form of Masonry that would allow man to regain the perfe ction they once had before the fall of Adam and Eve. His idea was to reform Masonry, an d he was going to make these proposals at the Congress of Wilhelmsbad. However, the Marquis of Constanza (known as “one of the most notorious of the I Iluminati”) informed him that the I Iluminati had already done that. In order to lure him, Weishaupt portrayed the Order as representing the greatest advancement in science, and dedicated to philosophical advancement. Since this fell in line with Knigge’s thinking, he was drawn into the Order. Knigge was definitely a catch, because he had a tal ent for organization, and soon became the head of the Westphalia Circle. He was in strumental in pushing for a merger between the Masons and the I Iluminati. Weishaupt wrote of him: “Philo is the ma ster from whom to take lessons; give me six men of his s tamp and with them I will change the face of the Universe ... Philo does more than w e all expected, and he is the man who alone will carry it all through.” Knigge was firmly supported by members of the Areop agite, who felt that Weishaupt’s supreme authority should be delegated t o others, and they agreed with Knigge’s proposed modifications for the organizatio n. They were adopted on July 9, 1781. Knigge was able to recruit the most effective propagandists, and from 1780 on, the growth of the Order was very rapid because its expansion was facilitated through its"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"affiliation with the Masonic lodges. Their goal was now to achieve their aims by splitti ng mankind into opposing ideologies, and for them to fight among themselves, thus weakening national governments and organized religion. An understanding was finally reached between the Ma sons and the I Iluminati, and on December 20, 1781, a combined Order was proposed , which would add to the I Iluminati organization, the first three degrees of Masonry. It wasn’t until the Congress of Wilhelmsbad from July 16th to August 29th, 1781 (which was attended by Masons, Martinistes, and representatives from other secret organizations from Europe, America and Asia), that the alliance was official. Those at the meeting were put under oath not to reveal anything. Comte de Virieu, a Mason from the Martiniste lodge at Lyons, upon his return home, when questioned about the Congress, sa id: “I will not confide them to you. I can only tell you that all this is very much more serious than you think. The conspiracy which is being woven is so well thought out, that i t will be, so to speak, impossible for the Monarchy and the Church to escape it.” He later denounced the I Iluminati, and became a devout Catholic. Gerald B. Winrod Because of a movement begun by Dohm’s book Upon the Civil Amelioration of the Condition of the Jews in 1781, and a book by Mirabeau in London, a resolu tion was passed at the Congress to allow Jews into the Lodge s. It was obvious that it was done for financial reasons, because the I Iluminati moved their headquarters to Frankfurt, Germany, a stronghold of Jewish finance. As the Ord er spread throughout Germany, money was contributed from such leading Jewish fami lies as the Oppenheimers, Wertheimers, Schusters, Speyers, Sterns, and of cou rse, the Rothschilds. Gerald B. Winrod wrote in his book Adam Weishaupt: A Human Devil that “of the thirty)nine chief sub)leaders of Weishaupt, seventeen were Jews.” Arg uments that the I Iluminati was solely of Jewish origin, are completely unfounded. After the Congress of Wilhelmsbad, the I Iluminati functioned under the following organizational structure: "},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":" NURSERY 1) Preparation 2) Novice 3) Minerval 4) Illuminatus SYMBOLIC (Masonry) 1) Apprentice 2) Fellow)Craft 3) Master SCOTCH (Masonry) 4) Illuminatus Major (Scotch Novice) 5) Illuminatus Dirigens (Scotch Knight) THE LESSER MYSTERIES 1) Presbyter (or Priest) 2) Prince (or Regent) THE GREATER MYSTERIES 3) Magus 4) Rex THE HOUSE OF ROTHSCHILD Mayer Amschel Rothschild No other name has become more synonymous with the I Iluminati than the Rothschilds. It is believed that the Rothschild fam ily used the I Iluminati as a means to achieving their goal of world)wide financial domina nce. Mayer Amschel Rothschild (1743)1812) was born in Frankfurt)on)the)Main in Germany, the s on of Moses Amschel Bauer, a banker and goldsmith. Their name was deriv ed from the ‘red shield’"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"(‘rotschildt’) that hung over the door of their sho p, and had been the emblem of revolutionary Jews in Eastern Europe. A few years a fter his father’s death, he worked as a clerk in a Hanover bank, which was owned by th e Oppenheimers. He became a junior partner, and soon left to take over the busi ness started by his father in 1750. He bought and sold rare coins, and later succeeded in buying out several other coin dealers. In 1769, he became a court agent for Prince William IX of Hesse)Kassel, who was the grandson of George II of England, a cousin to G eorge III, a nephew of the King of Denmark, and a brother)in)law to the King of Sweden . Soon Rothschild became the middleman for big Frankfurt bankers like the Bethma nn Brothers, and Rueppell & Harnier. After expanding his business to antiques, wineries, and the importing of manufactured materials from England, the Rothschild family began to amass a sizable fortune. Prince William inherited his father’s fortune upon his death in 1785, which was the largest private fortune in Europe. Some of this mon ey had come from Great Britain paying for the use of 16,800 Hessian soldiers to st op the revolution in America, because the money was never given to the troops. In 1804, t he Rothschilds secretly made loans to the Denmark government, on behalf of Prince Will iam. In June, 1806, when Napoleon’s troops pushed their way into Germany, Prince William fled to Denmark, leaving his money with May er Rothschild. History tells us that Rothschild secretly buried William’s ledgers, which revealed the full extent of his wealth, a list of debtors and the interest required from th em, and 600,000 pounds ($3,000,000), to keep Napoleon from confiscating it. Buderus von Carlhausen (Carl Buderus), the Treasury official who handled William’s finances, w as given ‘power of attorney,’ and he in turn made Rothschild his chief banker, responsib le for collecting the interest on the royal loans. Napoleon announced that all debts bein g paid to Prince William, were to go to the French Treasury, and offered a 25% commissio n on any debts that he would collect. Rothschild refused. Developing circumstances soon allowed the Rothschil ds to formulate a plan which would guarantee them the financial control of Europ e, and soon the world. It began with taking advantage of the outcome of the Battle of Wa terloo, which was fought at La) Belle)Alliance, seven miles south of Waterloo, whic h is a suburb of Brussels, Belgium. Early in the battle, Napoleon appeared to be winnin g, and the first secret military report to London communicated that fact. However, upon rei nforcements from the Prussians, under Gebhard Blucher, the tide turned in favor of Wellington. On Sunday, June 18, 1815, Rothworth, a courier of Nathan Rothschild, he ad of the London branch of the family, was on the battlefield, and upon seeing tha t Napoleon was being beaten, went by horse to Brussels, then to Ostende, and for 2,00 0 francs, got a sailor to get him to England across stormy seas. When Nathan Rothschild received the news on June 20th, he informed the government, who did not believe him . So, with everyone believing Wellington to be defeated, Rothschild immediately b egan to sell all of his stock on the English Stock Market. Everyone else followed his le ad, and also began selling, causing stocks to plummet to practically nothing. At the la st minute, his agents secretly began buying up the stocks at rock)bottom prices. On June 21, at 11 PM, Wellington’s envoy, Major Henry Percy showed up at the War Office with his report that Napoleon had been crushed in a bitter eight hour battle, losing a thi rd of his men. This gave the Rothschild"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"family complete control of the British economy, and forced England to set up a new Bank of England, which Nathan Rothschild controlled .   N apoleon  Wellingto n However, that wasn’t the only angle he used to prof it from the Battle of Waterloo. Mayer Amschel Rothschild sent some of William’s mon ey to his son Nathan in London, and according to the Jewish Encyclopedia : “Nathan invested it in 800,000 pounds of gold from the East India Company, knowing it would be needed for Wellington’s peninsula campaign. He made no less than four profi ts: (1) on the sale of Wellington’s paper (which he bought at 50¢ on the dollar); (2) o n the sale of gold to Wellington; (3) on its repurchase; and (4) on forwarding it to Port ugal. This was the beginning of the great fortune.” After Napoleon’s defeat, Prince William returned to resume his rule. Buderus was made a Baron, and the Rothschilds were the richest bankers in Europe. In 1817, France, in order to get back on their feet again, secured loans from a French banking house in Ouvrard, and from the Barin g Brothers in London. The Rothschilds saw their chance to get a firm grip on the French economy, and on October, 1818, Rothschild agents began buying huge amounts o f French government bonds, which caused their value to increase. On November 5 th, they were dumped on the open market, creating a financial panic as their value d eclined. Thus, the Rothschilds gained control of France. "},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":" Rothschild’s 5 sons Mayer Rothschild had established banks in England, France, and Germany. His sons, who were made Barons of the Austrian Empire, were set up to continue and expand his banking empire. Amschel Mayer Rothschild (1773)1855, who in 1838 said: “Permit me to issue and control the money of a nati on, and I care not who makes its laws.”) was in charge of the bank in Frankfurt, Ger many, which was known as M. A. Rothschild and Sons (which closed in 1901, after th e deaths of Mayer Karl and his brother, Wilhelm Karl, the sons of Karl Mayer Roths child). Salomon Mayer Rothschild (1774)1855) was the head of the bank in Vienna, Aus tria, known as S. M. Rothschild and Sons (which was closed during World War II afte r the Nazi occupation). Nathan Mayer Rothschild (1777)1836, who once said: “I care not what puppet is placed upon the throne of England to rule the Empire on which t he sun never sets. The man who controls Britain’s money supply controls the Britis h Empire, and I control the British money supply.”) was the head of the bank in London, England, which was known as N. M.

Soon the Ro thschilds spanned Europe with railroads, invested in coal and ironworks, financed England’s purchase of the Suez Canal, paid for oil exploration in Russia and the S ahara Desert, financed the czars of Russia, supported Cecil Rhodes’ diamond operations, aided France in creating an empire in Africa, financed the Hapsburg monarchs, a nd saved the Vatican from bankruptcy. In this country, through their American and European agents, they helped finance Rockefeller’s Standard Oil, Carnegie Steel, and Harriman’s Railroad. Werner Sombart, in his book The Jews and Modern Capitalism , said that from 1820 on, it was the “age of the Rothschild” and concluded that ther e was “only one power in Europe, and that is Rothschild.” In 1913, the family fortun e was estimated to be over two billion dollars. After Mayer Rothschild died on September 19, 1812, his will spelled out specific guidelines that were to be maintained by his descen dants: 1) All important posts were to be held by only fami ly members, and only male members were to be involved on the business end. Th e oldest son of the oldest son was to be the head of the family, unless otherw ise agreed upon by the rest of the family, as was the case in 1812, when Nathan wa s appointed as the patriarch. 2) The family was to intermarry with their own firs t and second cousins, so their fortune could be kept in the family, and to maintai n the appearance of a united financial empire. For example, his son James (Jacob ) Mayer married the daughter of another son, Salomon Mayer. This rule b ecame less important in later generations as they refocused family goals an d married into other fortunes. 3) Rothschild ordered that there was never to be “a ny public inventory made by the courts, or otherwise, of my estate ... Also I f orbid any legal action and any publication of the value of the inheritance.” American and British Intelligence have documented e vidence that the House of Rothschild, and other International Bankers, have f inanced both sides of every war, since the American Revolution. Financier Haym Salom on, who supported the patriots during the American Revolution, then later made loa ns to James Madison, Thomas Jefferson, and James Monroe, was a Rothschild agent . As explained earlier, during the Napoleonic Wars, one branch of the family funded Na poleon, while another financed Great Britain, Germany, and other nations. Their bo ldest maneuver came prior to the Civil War. The Rothschilds operate out of an area in the heart of London, England, the financial district, which is known as ‘The City,’ or the ‘Squ are Mile.’ All major British banks have their main offices here, along with branch offices for 385 foreign banks, including 70 from the United States. It is here that you will fi nd the Bank of England, the Stock Exchange, Lloyd’s of London, the Baltic Exchange (s hipping contracts), Fleet Street (home of publishing and newspaper interests), the L ondon Commodity Exchange (to trade coffee, rubber, sugar and wool), and the Lond on Metal Exchange. It is virtually the"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"financial hub of the world. Positioned on the north bank of the Thames River, c overing an area of 677 acres or one square mile (known as the “wealthiest square mi le on earth”), it has enjoyed special rights and privileges that enabled them to achieve a certain level of independence since 1191. In 1215, its citizens received a Charter from King John, granting them the right to annually elect a mayor (known as the Lord Mayor), a tradition that continues today. Both E. C. Knuth, in his book Empire of the City , and Des Griffin, in his book Descent into Slavery , stated their belief that ‘The City’ is actually a sovereign state (much like the Vatican), and that since the establi shment of the privately owned Bank of England in 1694, ‘The City’ has actually become the last word in the country’s national affairs, with Prime Minister, Cabinet, and Parliame nt becoming only a front for the real power. According to Knuth, when the queen enters ‘T he City,’ she is subservient to the Lord Mayor (under him, is a committee of 12)14 men, known as ‘The Crown’), because this privately)owned corporation is not subject to the Queen, or the Parliament. There seems to be little doubt that the Rothschilds continue to influence the world economy, and it is known that they are squarely beh ind the movement to unite all the western European nations into a single political en tity, which is just another step towards one)world government. FREEMASONRY Freemasons, or Masons, are members of a secret frat ernal order known as the Ancient Free and Accepted Masons, whose goals are, supposedly, to promote brotherhood. One of the major sourcebooks of Masoni c doctrine is Morals and Dogma of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Masonr y , written in 1871 by Albert Pike, and considered to be the “Masons guide for daily li ving.” In it, he writes: “Masonry is a search after Light...” According to early Masonic manuscripts, its origins can be traced back to Adam, who was said to be the first Mason. The apron of Ma sonry allegedly represents the fig leaves worn by Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. The knowledge received by Adam after eating from the forbidden tree, was carr ied on by his son Seth, and then Nimrod (who was responsible for the Tower of Babel) , the great)grandson of Noah. Dr. Albert Mackey (33rd Degree), in writing his Encyclopedia of Freemasonry , referred to the ‘York manuscript, No. 1’ that contained informa tion from a parchment dating back to the year 1560, which identified Babylon as the originator of Mason ry. He also cited the Cooke Manuscript (“The Legend of the Craft,” which was written in 1420, and is said to"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"be the second oldest Masonic manuscript), which rev eals that Nimrod taught the craft of Masonry to the workers at the Tower of Babel. When God confused their language, these secrets were said to be lost. When King Solomon was building the Temple, it is ta ught that Freemasonry was revived. Mackey said that the “Masonic Lodges were initially dedicated to King Solomon, because he was our first Most Excellent Gr and Master.” However, Martin L. Wagner revealed in An Interpretation of Freemasonry that the “name Solomon is not the Israelitish king. It is the name in form, but diffe rent in its meaning. It is a substitute ... a composite, Sol)om)on, the names of the sun in Latin , Indian and Egyptian, and is designed to show the unity of several god)ideas in the ancient religions, as well as with those of Freemasonry.” Hiram Abiff A story recounted in Masonic tradition, has to do w ith Hiram Abiff, a Syrian Master Mason, known as the architect of Tyre, who was said to be hired by Solomon to build the Temple. He was killed by three Fellow)Crafts, w hen he would not reveal the secret Masonic word (so they could get Master’s wages in f oreign countries), which was engraved on a gold triangle he wore around his neck . Solomon found the triangle, and had it placed in a secret vault under the Temple. A biff later became a Christ)like figure to the Masons. Mackey said that “Hiram represent(s) a popular Syrian god against whom the champions of Jehovah (the Jews) strove cea selessly.” Another Mason, Daniel Sickles, correlates him with an Egyptian god , and Pierson’s Traditions of Freemasonry said that he actually represented all of the pagan sun gods, as does Mackey’s Lexicon of Freemasonry . What this does, is to relate the message that it was the sun god who was the builder of the Temple, whic h makes this Temple symbolic, and not to be confused with the Jewish Temple. Pike sai d in his Morals and Dogma , that the “Temple of Solomon presented a symbolic image of th e Universe; and resembled, in its arrangements and furniture, all the temples of the ancient nations that practiced the mysteries.” In ancient Greece, there were organized groups, or guilds (like our unions), such as the ‘Dionysiacs,’ and in Rome, the ‘Collegium Murio rum,’ who built the temples and"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"stadiums. These groups, who were the forerunners of the Masons, were the draftsmen, builders, carpenters, and craftsmen who erected the huge cathedrals, castles, abbeys and churches during the Middle Ages. Because they ‘ lodged’ or lived together during the construction, this is where the term ‘masonic l odge’ was originated. The First Grand Lodge of England met at York in 926 , where they adopted handsigns and passwords to identify themselves. The ir workplace, or Lodges, was where their initiations, rites, rituals and ceremon ies took place. Within their inner circles, witchcraft was practiced. In the 13th century, they formed an association, he adquartered at Cologne, with Lodges at Strasbourg, Vienna, and Zurich. They call ed themselves Free Masons, and had ceremonies for initiation. Near the end of the 16th century, people who weren’t builders, were admitted into the fraternity, and we re called ‘Accepted’ Masons. They were usually distinguished members of the community , or in short, a source of funding. Becoming more symbolic, the working masons and buil ders eventually quit, as did the Accepted Masons, who had become disappointed at wha t the organization really was. The Bruton Vault Francis Bacon Sir Francis Bacon (1561)1626), an English Lord, the son of Elizabeth I, was recognized as the “founder of Free Masonry ... the guiding light of the Rosicrucian Order, the members of which kept the torch of the t rue universal knowledge, the Secret Doctrine of the Ages, alive during the dark night o f the Middle Ages.” Fluent in many languages, it has been believed by some that he was one of the editors of the King James Version of the Bible, as well as the true aut hor of the plays attributed to William Shakespeare. He had been initiated by a secret soci ety of intellectuals dedicated to civil and religious freedom. In his book Instauratio Magna , he wrote of a movement to “reorganize the sciences and restore man to the mas tery over nature that he was conceived to have lost by the fall of Adam.” "},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":" New Atlantis Bacon’s novel, New Atlantis , published in 1627, a year after his death, by his secretary William Rawley, represented his vision fo r a new “Golden Age.” It was about a crew of shipwrecked sailors who arrived on the shor es a mysterious, unknown land, whose people had a much higher developed culture an d possessed a technology unlike anything they had ever seen. He talked about buildi ngs a half a mile high, flying machines, underwater vehicles, and a government of philosopher)scientists working in behalf of an enlightened group of people who were c ommitted to learning, and a higher level of achievement.

In his 1944 book The Secret Destiny of America , he revealed that even though the New Atlantis had been completed, the entire version was never pu blished. He wrote: “The final (unpublished) chapters revealed the entire pa ttern secret societies had been working on for thousands of years to achieve the id eal commonwealth in the political world.” It included details for nurturing the “New Order of the Ages,” how this long range “Great Plan” would restore mankind to the original state that was intended to reflect the inner philosophical tradition of Freemasonry, and p roposed timetables. In The Secret Destiny of America Hall also wrote: “There exists in the world today, and has existed for thousands of years, a body of e nlightened humans united in what might be termed, an Order of the Quest.

In 1676, it was move d to Williamsburg, Virginia, where it was buried “in a great vault beneath the tower cent er of the first brick church in Bruton Parish.” The current church, known as the Bruton Pa rish Church (which was declared a National Historic Landmark), was built in 1715, and within the grounds of its graveyard (the site of the original church), and is where the Bruton Vault is located. It is believed by many serious researchers that Sir Francis Bacon faked his death (actually dying in 1684), and constructed the vault with the help of his Wild Goose Club. It is a 10 ft. by 10 ft. brick vault, possibly part of an underground Freemasonry Lodge that is buried 20 ft. deep, and marked by certain s trategically placed encoded memorials in the cemetery above.

Elias Ashmole, a banker, Rosicrucian, and founder of the Oxford Museum, who became a Mason in 1648, established the three basic degrees: 1) Entered Apprentice 2) Fellow)Craft 3) Master Mason On June 24, 1717, the four lodges in London were un ited into a Grand Lodge (sometimes called the Grand Mother Lodge) by three members who met at the Apple Tree Tavern, thus beginning the era of modern Freem asonry. Rather than being a guild of stone masons and builders, they altered their ph ilosophy and became a pseudo) religion who “tried to cooperate with the Church so as to be able to work from the inside, rationalize the doctrine of Jesus and empty it grad ually of its mystical content. Freemasonry hoped to become a friendly and legal he ir to Christianity. They considered logic and the rules of scientific thinking as being the only absolute and permanent element of the human mind.” By 1725, the movement h ad spread to France. The members of the Grand Lodge of England brought t heir fraternity to America. In 1730, Daniel Core was appointed Provincial Grand Ma ster of New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, after the first lodge was establi shed in Philadelphia. A lodge was"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"established in Boston in 1733. By the time of the A merican Revolution, there were 100 Masonic lodges. The Masons were firmly entrenched i n the eastern colonies, but since 95% of the population identified themselves as Chri stians, they had to modify their philosophies to include Christian teachings. The Gr and Lodge of the United States was established in 1777, which officially cut all ties to their British counterparts. One writer summed up Masonry this way: “Freemasonry has incorporated bits of other systems in its initiations and higher degrees , such as mystery schools, Mithraism, the Egyptian priesthood, the system of the Pythagor eans, Essenes, Cabalists, Druids, the Orders of the Knighthood, Rosicrucians, Arabic secret societies, and the Knights Templar.” Masonry slowly spread throughout the world: France (1718)25), Ireland (1725)26), Spain (1726)27), Holland (1731), Germany (1730)33), Africa (1735), Scotland (1736), Portugal (1736), Switzerland (1737), Italy (1733)37 ), Russia (1731)40), Canada (1745), Sweden (1735)48), Prussia (1738)40) , Austria (1742), Poland (1784), and Mexico (1825).   Benjamin Franklin  George Washing ton Originally against the Masonic Order, Benjamin Fran klin became a Mason in 1731, at the age of 25. He became the Provincial Grand Ma ster of Pennsylvania in 1734, and was the “appointed spokesman” of the secret societi es. As ambassador to France, he was honored there at a major Masonic lodge. It is b elieved that while he was on a diplomatic trip to Paris to seek financing for the Revolution, he was initiated as a member of the I Iluminati. George Washington joined the Fredericksb urg Lodge #4 in Virginia, in 1752, and when he was elected Presiden t in 1789, he was the Grand Master of the Lodge (the highest official). He took his Oa th of Office on a Masonic Bible, as did his Vice)President, John Adams, who was also a Maso n. This Masonic Bible from the altar of St. Johns Lodge No. 1 in New York City, wh ich was printed in London in 1767, was later used for other Oaths administered to Hard ing, Eisenhower, Carter, Reagan and Bush. This Masonic Bible has an introductory se ction that explains that Masonry is not a Christian fraternity, but in fact supports al l religions. Eight of the signers of the Declaration of Independence were also members of th e Fredericksburg Lodge.

Because of the disagreement between various books a nd on)line sources, representing Masonic and non)Masonic sources, it’s easy to see how erroneous information becomes perpetuated as fact and truth. If the Masons can’t even nail down the specifics of their own history, then the only t hing we can hope to do, is to produce as accurate of a picture as possible, based on the fac ts.

It was commonly believed that the reason for the Revolution was “taxation without representation,” when actually it was becau se the Parliament in the 1760’s passed a law that no colony could issue its own mon ey. The colonies had to issue bonds, and sell them to the Bank, who would then lo an them money. This forced the colonies to pay interest on their money. The Revolu tion was ignited by the Boston Tea Party, which was planned during a dinner at the Bra dlee home. The participants were from the St. Andrew Lodge in Boston, who dressed up as Mohawk Indians, and went aboard the Dartmouth, which was anchored in the har bor, and dumped its load of tea overboard. The British government responded by clos ing the port, and sending in British troops. Empress Catherine the Great of Russia, who wasn’t controlled by the International Bankers, refused to send in 20,000 Ru ssian troops against the colonists, when asked by King George III of England. The attac k unified the colonies against England. The Supreme Council of Scottish Rite Freemasonry wa s established in Charleston, South Carolina in 1801, because that area was geogr aphically located on the 33rd parallel. They are an extension of French Freemason ry, and considered liberal. In 1755, the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemason ry had expanded to 32 degrees, and then they added a 33rd degree. In 1813, the Nor thern Supreme Council was established, consisting of 15 states, and was headq uartered in Boston. They were an extension of English Freemasonry, and are considere d conservative. The Supreme Council, which represented the Southern jurisdictio n, relocated to Washington, D.C., and covers the remaining 35 states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. protectorates. It is considered the Mother Supreme Council of the Wor ld. Among the Presidents who have been Masons: Washingt on, Jefferson (33rd Degree), Madison, Monroe, Jackson, Polk, Buchanan, Andrew Johnson (32nd Degree and Grand Master), Garfield, McKinley, Theodore Roo sevelt, Taft, Harding (32nd Degree), Franklin Roosevelt (32nd Degree), Truman ( 33rd Degree and Grand Master), Eisenhower, Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson (1st Degree), Nixon, Ford (33rd Degree), Carter, Reagan (33rd Degree), and George H. W. Bush , Sr. Many State Governors, U.S. Senators and Congressmen are Masons. The Masonic Bible says that “for well over 150 years, the desti ny of this country has been determined largely by men who were members of the Masonic frat ernity.” There is about 16,000 Blue or Symbolic Lodges, with a Grand Lodge in every state, which represent more than four million members. The re are 150 Grand Lodges in the world, and a world)wide membership of over 6,000,00 0. Members must be 21 years old; however, sons of memb ers can be initiated at 18. Before consideration, an initiate must prove themse lves to be “mentally and physically competent, of good moral character, and believe in the existence of a Supreme Being.” Among their affiliated organizations: The Order of Demolay, The Order of Rainbow for Girls, and The Order of Job’s Daughters, which allo w children as young as 11 to become indoctrinated in Masonic teaching. The Order of the Eastern Star, Ancient Arabic Order of Nobles of the Mystic Shrine, and Da ughters of the Nile are organizations closely aligned with the Masons. Their literature claims that “Freemasonry is not a religion even though it is a religion in character ... does not pretend to take the place of religion nor serve as a substitute for the religious beliefs of its members ... (and) acce pts men, found to be worthy,"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"regardless of religious convictions.” They claim th at they exist “to make good men better through its firm belief in the Fatherhood of God, t he Brotherhood of Man (and) consists of men bound together by bonds of Brotherly Love an d Affection.” Examining Masonic Tradition Any organization which strives to adhere to such a high moral standard certainly should deserve our admiration and respect. However, why have they elicited the criticism that they have? The Vatican has issued ma ny Edicts condemning Masonry: Pope Clement XII in 1738, Pope Benedict XIV in 1751 , Pope Pius VII in 1821, Pope Leo XII in 1825, Pope Pius VIII in 1829, Pope Gregory X VI in 1832, Pope Pius IX in 1846 and 1873, and Pope Leo XIII in 1884 and 1892. Pope Leo XXIII said that the goal of the Masons was the “overthrow of the whole religious, p olitical and social order based on Christian institutions and the establishment of a s tate of things based on pure naturalism.” Until 1974, the Roman Catholic Church had forbidden its members to be Masons, and on March 21, 1981, the Vatican warned t hat “all Roman Catholics who belong to Masonic lodges risk excommunication.” In 1784, and again in 1845, the Bavarian government considered Masonry a danger to the state. In 1814, The Regency of Milan and Gov ernor of Venice echoed these same sentiments. King John VI of Portugal issued orders in 1816, and again in 1824, prohibiting the operation of the fraternity. In Rus sia, in 1820, Alexander I banished the Order. Many writers in the late 1800’s, such as Archbishop Meurin and Dr. Bataille, said that Masonry was just a cover organization for Sata n worship, which occurred within its higher degrees, and was unknown to the ordinary mem ber. In 1921, Dr. James Anderson wrote a booklet on Freemasonry called The Anderson Constitution in which he wrote: “Freemasonry rapidly expanded in Europe. In France, a number of the Masonic sects dabbled with magic and occultism. In Germany some were called Order of the Gold, and Rosy Cross (or Rosicrucians). In E ngland, during the 1880’s, the famous magical society, the Hermetic Order of the G olden Dawn adopted most of the Masonic grades.” Many Druid ceremonies and witchcra ft rites have been incorporated into Masonic rituals. So, are the Masons a Christian organization? The an swer is a resounding No! Their literature claims that Jesus was just a man, equal to Mohammed and Krishna, the Hindu god. He is called the “son of Joseph,” not the Son of God. Initiates are told that Masonic rituals are “based on the Bible,” however in Chase’ s Digest of Masonic Law it says that “Masonry has nothing whatever to do with the Bible ... it is not founded upon the Bible, for if it were it would not be Masonry, it would be something else.” Chase said that the Bible is just one of the ‘holy books’ of man, equal to the Koran, Hindu Scriptures and others. Its literal meaning was meant only for the ignorant masses. "},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":" Royal Arch degree At the end of the initiation for the Royal Arch deg ree, the initiate has the lost name of ‘God’ whispered to him, which is ‘Jebulon.’ Mackey, in his Encyclopedia of Freemasonry , said that “Freemasonry is not Christianity,” and indicates that this name actually represents a composite of the names of the sun god of three religions: ‘Jah,’ the Syrian form of Jehovah; ‘Eel,’ which is Baal; and ‘ On,’ the Egyptian sun god. J. D. Buck (32nd degree) wrote in Mystic Masonry (1925): “The only personal God Freemasonry accepts is humanity in toto ... Humanity therefore is the only personal God that there is.” Their Masonic philosophy is that God is whatever yo u want him to be and is referred to in general terms as the ‘deity’ and the ‘Great Arch itect of the Universe,’ but in higher degrees, he is identified as a force of nature, usu ally the sun. Mackey, in his Masonic Rituals said that the elimination of the name of Jesus, an d references to Him, in Bible verses used in rituals are “slight but necessary modifications.” Mackey also wrote in his Lexicon of Freemasonry : “The religion then of Masonry is pure theism on which its different membe rs engraft their particular opinions, but they are not permitted to introduce them into t he lodge or to connect their truth or falsehood with the truth of Masonry ... A Christian Mason is not permitted to introduce his own peculiar opinions with regard to Christ’s m ediatorial office into the Lodge.” No Masonic prayers in monitors, handbooks and guides, end in Jesus’ name, and if it is discovered that they do, the Grand Lodge of that st ate will revoke their charter. Edmond Ronayne (a Master Mason), wrote on page 74 of the Masonic Handbook (later revised to eliminate the passage): “When a brother reveals any of our great secrets ... or whenever a minister prays in the name of Christ in any of our assemblies, you must always hold yourself in readiness, if called upon, to cut his throat from ear to ear, pull out his tongue by the roots, and bury his body at t he bottom of some lake or pond.” According to Morris in The Freemason’s Monitor (or Webb’s Monitor ), which omits any reference to the name of Jesus: “Prayer ... should be of a general character, containing nothing offensive to any class of conscientious bre thren.” "},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":" Norman Vincent Peale Dr. Norman Vincent Peale (1898)1993), author of The Power of Positive Thinking was a 33rd degree Mason and his name appeared in ma ny Masonic publications. In March, 1991, he was featured in the cover story of The Scottish Rite Journal (formerly known as the New Age magazine), and is quoted as saying that “Masonry b ecame an early and essential part of my success.” On Sunday, February 24, 1991, Peale had told the congregation of Robert Schuller’s Crystal Cathe dral in California: “Jesus Christ, Buddha and Krishna are examples of great philosophe rs who taught how to use mind power.” In May, 1991, at a Dallas, Texas seminar fo r Christian writers, Dina Donahue, a contributing editor for Guidepost magazine (which Peale founded), said that any submission to the publication can never refer to th e deity of Jesus, and claim that He is the only means by which salvation can be achieved. He can only be presented in a historical context as a prophet and philosopher. Sh e said that the reason for this was that “ Guidepost is an interfaith magazine, and Dr. Peale does not want to offend those who are not Christians.” In Les Sectes et Societies Secretes published in 1863, Le Couteulx de Canteleu wrote that the goal of the Masonic Order “was, is a nd will always be the struggle against the Church and the Christian religion...” Joseph Fo rt Newton wrote in The Builders : “Masonry ... is Religion, a worship in which all go od men may unite, that each may share the faith of all ... Where else, except in a Masonic lodge, could men of many religions meet, each praying for all and all for on e.” Mackey wrote in his Textbook of Masonic Jurisprudence , that Masonry is “undoubtedly a religious institut ion”; and also in his Manual of the Lodge , he emphatically states that “Masonry is a religio us institution.” Buck wrote in Mystic Masonry that Masonry is “a world wide religion ... Masonry is the universal religion only because and so long as it e mbraces all religions.” High level Masons believe that Lucifer never fell t o earth and that Lucifer is really God, and refer to Jehovah by the name of ‘Adonay,’ saying that he is the god of evil because he forces men to be subservient to his repr essive dictates. Masonic books given to handpicked members of the 32nd and 33rd De grees, say that Jesus was an impostor, and that Lucifer is the true God. The Mas ons have their own Luciferian based calendar.

The truth must be kept secret, and the masses need a teaching proportioned to their imperfect reason.” He wrote that “every ma n’s conception of God must be proportioned to his mental cultivation, and intelle ctual powers, and moral excellence. God is, as man conceives him, the reflected image o f man himself.” The next statement reduces the Masonic philosophy to a single premise. Pike writes: “The true name of Satan, the Kabalists say, is that of Yahweh reverse d; for Satan is not a black god ... Lucifer, the Light Bearer! Strange and mysterious n ame to give to the Spirit of Darkness! Lucifer, the Son of the Morning! Is it he who bears the Light ... Doubt it not!” These various passages should settle any arguments concerning the anti)Christian nature of the Masons. Their role in history seemed to be to act as a diluting factor, to lessen the impact of Christianity through tolerance , and to politically work towards the goals established by the I Iluminati.

By the time of the 3rd Masonic Congress in Frankfur t in 1786, the I Iluminati virtually controlled all the Masonic lodges, and at this meet ing their goals were stated as: “1) Pantheism for the higher degrees, atheism for the l ower degrees and the populace; 2) Communism of goods, women, and general concerns; 3) The destruction of the Church, and all forms of Christianity, and the removal of a ll existing human governments to make way for a universal republic in which the utop ian ideas of complete liberty from existing social, moral, and religious restraint, ab solute equality, and social fraternity, should reign.” Students who were members of wealthy families, with international leanings, were recommended for special training in internationalis m. Those selected by the I Iluminati were given scholarships to attend special schools. Weishaupt wrote: “I propose academies under the direction of the Order. This wi ll secure us the adherence of the Literati. Science shall here be the lure.” He also wrote: “We must acquire the direction of education, of church, management of the professoria l chair, and of the pulpit.” Today, there are many such schools.

"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":" Black goat’s head on the Weishaupt Family Coat of Arms is a good indication of Satanic worship Weishaupt, worried that his control of the Order wa s diminishing, argued repeatedly with Knigge. While he preferred to work in secrecy, Knigge wanted to move on to more substantial things. In January, 1783, Knigge wrote in a letter to Zwack: “It is the Jesuitry of Weishaupt that causes all our divisions, it is t he despotism that he exercises over men perhaps less rich than himself in imagination, in ruses, in cunning ... I declare that nothing can put me on the same footing with Spartac us as that on which I was a first.” He also wrote: “I abhor treachery and profligacy, a nd I leave him to blow himself and his Order into the air.” On April 20, 1784, Knigge quit , followed by Baron Bassus (‘Hannibal’), Count Torring, Prince Kreitmaier, and others. In July, Knigge signed an agreement promising to return all documents in his possession, and to keep quiet on what he knew about their plans and activities. Some researchers believe that Knigge had also discovered that Weishaupt was a Satanist. He resumed his work as a writer, later becoming an inspector of schools at Bremen, w here he died on May 6, 1796. To insure that the activities of the Order would re main a secret, a warning as to the consequences of betraying the Order was including i n the ceremony of initiation. They would point a sword at the initiate and say: “If yo u are a traitor and a perjurer, learn that all our Brothers are called upon to arm themselves against you. Do not hope to escape or find a place of safety. Wherever you are, shame, remorse, and the rage of our Brothers will pursue you, and torment you to the in nermost recesses of your entrails.” In October, 1783, Joseph Utzschneider, a lawyer, wh o had dropped out of the Order in August, presented to the Duchess Maria Anna, a d ocument which detailed the activities of the I Iluminati. He was upset because he had been promote d too slow, and was constantly prodded to prove his loyalty. The Du chess gave the information to the Duke. On June 22, 1784, Duke Karl Theodore Dalberg, the Elector Palatinate of Bavaria, after discovering from the information tha t the goals of the I Iluminati were to “in time rule the world,” by overthrowing all civil gov ernment, criticized all secret societies, and groups established without government sanction. On March 2, 1785, he issued a"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"proclamation identifying the I Iluminati as a branch of the Masons, and ordered th at their Lodges be shut down.

Karl Theodore Dalberg After being replaced at the University in February, Weishaupt fled across the border into Regensburg, finally settling in Gotha, where h e found refuge with another I Iluminati member, the Duke of Saxe)Gotha. In April, 1785, Utzschneider was able to convince t hree other members to come forward. They were fellow professors at the Marienb urg (Marianen) Academy who had doubts about the validity of the organization’s pri nciples when they discovered that they would receive no mystical powers. They were also di sgruntled over Weishaupt’s tyranny. Cossandey, Grunberger, and Renner went bef ore the Court of Inquiry on September 9, 1785, where they supplied valuable inf ormation, such as membership lists, and revealed their aims and goals, which the y consolidated into the following six points: 1) Abolition of the Monarchy and all ordered govern ment. 2) Abolition of private property. 3) Abolition of inheritance. 4) Abolition of patriotism. 5) Abolition of the family, through the abolition o f marriage, all morality, and the institution of communal education for children. 6) Abolition of all religion. The purposes of these six points were to divide the people politically, socially, and economically; to weaken countries and create a one) world government. They testified that “all religion, all love of country and loyalty to sovereigns, were to be annihilated...” The government pardoned all public officials and mi litary leaders who publicly admitted membership.

In July, 1785, h e instructed Zwack to put their plans in book form. This book contained a history of the I Iluminati, and many of their ideas for expansion and future endeavors. A copy was sent by courier (identified as Jacob Lanze) to I Iluminati members in Paris and Silesia. However, af ter leaving Frankfurt, as the courier rode through Regensburg (another source says it was Ratisbon) on horseback, he was struck by lightning and killed. T he authorities found the document and turned it over to the government. Another sourc e indicates the possibility that he may have been murdered, and the documents planted o n him. Xavier Zwack (‘Cato’), a government lawyer, and one of the Order’s most prominent leaders, whose name was on Renner’s list, had his h ouse in Landshut illegally searched by the police in October, 1785, and his papers seiz ed. He was dismissed from his position. Many books, documents, papers and corresp ondence were discovered, including over 200 letters written between Weishaup t and the members of the Areopagite, which dealt with matters of the highest secrecy.

Zwack, who was banished, sought sanctuary in the Co urt of Zweibrucken, where he was later appointed to an official position in the principality of Salm)Kyburg. He contributed to the I Iluminati movement in Holland. He was later summone d by Dalberg, as the government tried to deal with the problem of fugitives who might attempt to reorganize the Order. Zwack fled to England. On November 15, 1790, another Edict was announced a gainst the members of the organization. Anyone found to be an active member, was to be put to death. The following year, a list of 91 names of alleged membe rs was compiled. They were hunted down, and banished. This harassment didn’t end unti l 1799, when Dalberg died.

Weishaupt wrote: “The great care of the I Iluminati after the publication of their secret writings was to persuade the whole of Germany that their Order no longer existed, that their adepts ha d all renounced, not only their mysteries, but as members of a secret society.” Wei shaupt had a contingency plan ready, and wrote: “By this plan we shall direct all mankind. In this manner, and by the simplest means, we shall set in motion and in flame s. The occupations must be allotted and contrived, that we may in secret, influence all political transactions ... I have considered everything and so prepared it, that if t he Order should this day go to ruin, I shall in a year re)establish it more brilliant than ever.” To hide their subversive activities, the highest me mbers of the Order began to masquerade as humanitarians and philanthropists. We ishaupt fled to Switzerland, later returning to Germany, where the Duke of Saxe)Gotha gave him sanctuary. The Order moved their headquarters to London, where it began to grow again. Weishaupt told his followers to infiltrate the lodges of Blue Masonry, and to form secret circles within them. Only Masons who proved themselves as Internationali sts, and were atheists, were initiated into the I Iluminati. THE GERMAN UNION Dr. Charles Frederick Bahrdt (1741)1793), an I Iluminati member, Mason, and German theologian, who was the professor of Sacred Philogy at the University of Leipzig, took advantage of the I Iluminati’s apparent demise by recruiting several o f its members for his so)called ‘German Union’ in 1787. B ahrdt, the son of a minister, called his group the German Union for Rooting Out Supersti tion and Prejudices and Advancing True Christianity. In 1785, Bahrdt had received an anonymous letter, c ontaining the plans for the German Union, which was signed, “From some Masons, your great admirers.” That same year, he was visited by an Englishman who urge d him to establish the Union, promising to link it with the British Masonic struc ture. In 1787, he received another letter containing more details and organizational details."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"Bahrdt had done some religious propaganda work for Weishaupt, “to destroy the authority of the Scriptures,” and it was commonly b elieved that it was Weishaupt who was directing the activities of the organization be hind the scenes in order to carry on the goals of the I Iluminati. The German Union appeared to be a Reading Society, and one was set up in Zwack’s house in Landshut. Weishaupt wrote: “Next t o this, the form of a learned of literary society is best suited to our purpose, and had Freemasonry not existed, this cover would have been employed; and it may be much more than a cover, it may be a power engine in our hands. By establishing reading societies, and subscription libraries, and taking these under our direction, and supplying them through our labors, we may turn the public mind which way we will ... A litera ry society is the most proper form for the introduction of our Order into any State where we are yet strangers.” They planned about 800 such Reading Rooms. The membership initially consisted of 17 young men, and about five of Bahrdt’s friends. Knigge helped him to develop the organizat ional structure, which was divided into six grades: 1) Adolescent 2) Man 3) Elder 4) Mesopolite 5) Diocesan 6) Superior The ‘Society of the 22’ or the ‘Brotherhood’ was it s inner circle. In a pamphlet entitled To All Friends of Reason, Truth and Virtue , Bahrdt wrote that the organization’s purpose was to accomplish the en lightenment of people in order to disseminate religion, remove popular prejudices, ro ot out superstition, and restore liberty to mankind. They planned to have magazines and pamphlets, but by 1788, Bahrdt had sunk over $1,000 into the group, and was spending all of his time working on it. Despite his efforts, they still only had 200 members. Near the end of 1788, Frederick Wilhelm, the King o f Prussia, worried about the growth of the organization, had Johann Christian vo n Wollner, one of his ministers, write an opposing view to Bahrdt’s pamphlet, called the Edict of Religion . Bahrdt responded by anonymously writing another pamphlet of the same name to satirize it. In 1789, a bookseller by the name of Goschen, wrote a pamphlet called More Notes Than Text, on the German Union of XXII, a New Secret Society for the Good of Mankind , in which he revealed that the group was a continuation of the I Iluminati. The German Union, which represented Weishaupt’s “co rrected system of Illuminism,” never really got off the ground becaus e of its openness, which provoked hostile attacks from the government and members of the clergy. Bahrdt left the group and opened up a tavern known as ‘Bahrdt’s Repose.’ The German Union ceased to exist after he died in 1793.

Jacob Mauvillon while he was in Berlin on a secret mission for King Louis XVI of France in 1786. Mirabeau introduced I Iluminati principles at the Paris Masonic Lodge of the Amis Reunis (later renamed ‘Philalethes’), and init iated Abbé Charles)Maurice de Talleyrand)Perigord (1754)1838, a court cleric in t he House of Bourbon). Charles)Maurice de Talleyrand)Perigord The most trusted members were brought into the ‘Sec ret Committee of United Friends’ (it is interesting to note that a group of the same name originated in 1771 as an occult group). The initiations took place at the I Iluminati’s Grand Lodge, about 30 miles from Paris, in the Ermenonville mansion owned by th e Marquis de Gerardin. The famous impostor Saint Germain (1710)1780, or 1785) presided over the initiation ceremonies. Germain was believed to be a Portuguese Jew, who wa s a member of the Philalethes Lodge. He was a Mason, a Rosicrucian, a nd belonged to several other occult brotherhoods. He spoke Italian, German, Engl ish, Spanish, French, Greek, Sanskrit, Arabic, and Chinese. He was said to be th e son of Prince Rakoczy of Transylvania; raised by the last Medici, Gian Gasto ne; and was educated at the University of Siena. He told people that he had liv ed for centuries, and knew King Solomon. He was arrested in London in 1743 for bein g a Jacobite spy, and he took credit for establishing Freemasonry in Germany. As an impostor, he posed as Comte Bellamarre, Marquis de Montferrat, and Chevalier Sc hoening. During the initiation, new members were sworn to “r eveal to thy new chief all thou shalt have heard, learned and discovered, and also to seek after and spy into things that might have otherwise escaped thy notice ... (a nd to) avoid all temptation to betray what thou has now heard. Lightning does not strike so quickly as the dagger which will reach thee wherever thou mayest be.” Count Alessandro de Cagliostro (also known as Giuse ppe Balsamo), a Jew from"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"Sicily, who was said to be one of the greatest occu lt practitioners of all time, was initiated into the I Iluminati at Mitau (near Frankfurt) in 1780, in an underground room.

From it, a member read the oath of secrecy, which b egan: “We, Grand Masters of Templars...” It was written in blood. The book was an outline of their plans, which included an attack on Rome. He discovered that they had money at their disposal in banks at Amsterdam, Rotterdam, London, Genoa, and V enice. He found out that the I Iluminati had 20,000 lodges throughout Europe and A merica, and that their members served in every European court. Cagliostro was inst ructed to go to Strasbourg, France, to make the initial contacts necessary for the inst igation of the French Revolution. Identified as a Grand Master of the Prieuré de Sion , it is believed that he was the liaison between them and the I Iluminati. He was arrested in 1790, in Rome, for re volutionary activities. Alessandro de Cagliostro The French Masons had committed themselves to a pla n for overthrowing the government, under the guise of liberty and equality ; ending the autocratic regimes, in order to have government by and for the people. Jer emy Bentham and William Petty (Earl of Shelburne) planned and directed the French Revolution, then later directed the plot towards America. In 1788, at the request of Mirabeau and Talleyrand, Johann Joachim Christoph Bode (1730)1793, ‘Amelius’), a lawyer at Weimar, and a M ason, was summoned to France. He had been initiated into the I Iluminati at the Congress of Wilhelmsbad, and later took over the Order in the absence of Weishaupt. Bode an d Baron de Busche (‘Bayard’), a Dutch military officer in the service of the Landgr ave of Hesse)Darmstadt, in order to conceal the purpose of their presence in France, sa id they were there to investigate the influence of the Jesuits on the secret societies. H owever, the real reason for them being there, was to further the goals of the I Iluminati in France. They operated out of the Lodge of the Amis Reunis, changing its name to ‘Phi lalethes,’ which means, ‘searchers after the truth.’ The Marquis de Luchet, a friend of Mirabeau, wrote in his Essay on the Sect of the I Iluminati in January, 1789: “Deluded people.

Eve ry species of error which afflicts the earth, every half)baked idea, every invention serve s to fit the doctrines of the I Iluminati ...

Soon other lodges become aligned with the Philalethes, such as the Nine Sisters; the Lodge of Candor, which included member s like Laclos, Sillery, D ́Aiguillon; the Lameth Brothers, Dr. Guillotine, and Lafayette; and the Propaganda, which was established by Condorcet, Abbé Sieyes, and Rochenfo ucault. Revolutionary leaders in France, such as Maximilien Francois Marie Isidore de Robespierre (1758)1794), who was made head of the R evolution by Weishaupt; Marquis Antoine Nicholas Condorcet (1743)1794), phi losopher and politician; Duke de la Rochenfoucault; George Jacques Danton (1759)1794 ); Marquis Marie Joseph de Lafayette (1757)1834), General and statesman; Jerom e Petion de Villeneuve (1756) 1794), politician; Philippe, Duke of Orleans, Grand Master of French Freemasonry; de Leutre; Fauchet; Cammille Benoit Desmoulins (1760)1 794), D ́Alembert; Denis Diderot (1713)1784), encyclopedist; and Jean)Francois de la Harpe (1739)1803), critic and playwright, all joined the I Iluminati, who had eventually infiltrated all 266 M asonic lodges by 1789, even though the Masons weren’t aware of it .

For instance, the Duke of Orleans instructed his agents to buy up as much grain as they could, then the people were led to believe that the King intentionally caused the shortage, and that the French people were starving. Fellow conspirators in the government helped create runaway inflation. Thus th e people were manipulated into turning against a king whose reign had strengthened the middle class. The monarchy was to be destroyed, and the middle class oppressed . God was to be replaced by the I Iluminati’s religion of reason that “man’s mind wou ld solve man’s problems.” During the first two years of the French Revolution , which started in April, 1789, the I Iluminati had infiltrated the Masonic Lodges to suc h an extent, that they had ceased operation, and instead rallied under the name, “The French Revolutionary Club.” When they needed a larger meeting place, they used the h all of the Jacobin’s Convent. This revolutionary group of 1300 people emerged on July 14, 1789 as the Jacobin Club. The I Iluminati controlled the Club, and were directly re sponsible for fermenting the activities which developed into the French Revolution. Lord Ac ton wrote: “The appalling thing in the French Revolution is not the tumult but the des ign. Through all the fire and smoke, we perceived the evidence of calculating organizati on. The managers remain studiously concealed and masked; but there is no doubt about t heir presence from the first.” In the playing out of a plan which called for the p opulation to be cut down by one) third to one)half, over 300,000 people died, includ ing the execution of King Louis and his family. This was done to insure the stability o f the new French Republic. In August, 1792, after the overthrow of the government, the tr i)colored banner was replaced by the red flag of social revolution, while the cry of “Vi ve notre roi d ́Orleans” gave way to the Masonic watchword, “Liberty, Equality, Fraternity!” Those who responded with the proper Masonic handsigns, had their lives spared. B y November, 1793, as the massacres had spread all over France, the churches had been reorganized along the lines of Weishaupt’s contention that “reason should be the only code of man.” Talleyrand, who became the bishop of Autin in 1788, because of his radical reorganization of the Church, was excommunicated by the Pope. He became a deputy to the National Assembly. The Jacobins controlled t he National Assembly, and for all intents and purposes, Mirabeau became France’s lead er. In true Democratic spirit, he said: “We must flatter the people by gratuitous jus tice, promise them a great diminution in taxes and a more equal division, more extension in fortunes, and less humiliation."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"These fantasies will fanaticize the people, who wil l flatten all resistance.” The Revolution was considered at an end on July 28, 1794, when Rob espierre was guillotined. Thomas Jefferson, who served as minister to France for three years (1785)89), described the events as “so beautiful a revolution” and said that he hoped it would sweep the world. Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamil ton said that Jefferson helped start the French Revolution, and wrote in a letter to a friend, dated May 26, 1792, that Jefferson “drank freely of the French philosophy, i n religion, in science, in politics. He came from France in the moment of fermentation, whi ch he had a share in inciting.” Jefferson wrote to Brissot de Warville in Philadelp hia, in a letter dated May 8, 1793, that he was “eternally attached to the principles of the French Revolution.” In 1987, during a trip to the United States by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and his wife, where they visited the Jefferson Memorial, she referred to Jef ferson as “one of the world’s greatest thinkers.”   Thomas Jefferson  Nikolai Lenin It is interesting to note, that during the Communis t revolution, Nikolai Lenin said: “We, the Bolsheviks, are the Jacobins of the Twenti eth Century...” An Illuminist, and member of the revolutionary Fren ch National Assembly, Vicomte de Barras, witnessed a 24 year old Napoleon repelli ng a siege at Toulon in 1793 by English and Spanish military forces. Barras, appoin ted by the Assembly as the Commander)in)Chief of the French military, in 1795 became a member of the five)man Directorate, which began to govern France, and soon became the most powerful political figure in the country. He chose Napoleon to lead the military forces. However, in 1799, Napoleon (a Knights Templar) broke his ties w ith Barras, because he feared Barras was attempting to restore the Monarchy. Napo leon eliminated the Directorate, and in 1804, with the support of Talleyrand (who se rved as his foreign minister), became Emperor. Unwittingly, as a puppet of the I Iluminati, his reign brought about the total disruption of Europe, which was needed for th e I Iluminati to get control and unify it. He ended the Holy Roman Empire, and made his brothe r Joseph, the King of Naples in 1806. Joseph was replaced by Napoleon’s brother)in) law Murat, when Joseph became the King of Spain in 1808. His brother Louis was ma de the King of Holland, and another brother Jerome, the King of Westphalia.

Although most were later returned to Rome, some were kept. By this time, Napoleon had ch anged the face of Europe, but, he settled his warring ways and ultimately the French Revolution had failed, because Europe had not been fully conquered. The I Iluminati immediately took steps to dethrone him, which took five years. In order to get money t o Wellington’s English forces, Nathan Rothschild funneled money to his brother James (who handled financial transactions for the French government), in Paris, who got it to Wel lington’s troops in Spain. In addition, the I Iluminati secretly worked to make agreements that s hifted national alliances against France. Upon his defeat at Waterloo, Napoleon was again exi led, this time, to the island of Saint Helena in the south Atlantic, which is where he died in 1821. He had written in his will: “I die before my time, killed by the English oligarchy and its hired assassins.” THE I LLUMINATI SPREADS TO AMERICA In 1785, the Columbia Lodge of the Order of the I Iluminati was established in New York City. Among its members were Governor DeWitt C linton, Horace Greeley (politician and editor of the New York Daily Tribune ), Charles Dana, and Clinton Roosevelt (the ancestor of Franklin D. Roosevelt). Roosevelt wrote a book called Science of Government Founded on Natural Law , in which he wrote: “There is no God of justice to order things aright on earth, if ther e be a God, he is a malicious and revengeful being, who created us for misery.” He re ferred to himself and other members as the “enlightened ones,” and said that the U.S. C onstitution was a “leaky vessel” which was “hastily put together when we left the Br itish flag,” and therefore needed revision."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":" DeWitt Clinton In 1786, a lodge was started in Portsmouth, Virgini a, where allegedly, Thomas Jefferson was a member; followed by fourteen others in different cities of the thirteen colonies.

In April, 1793, France sent new ambassado r Edmond Genet to America, so he could collect payment for the American debt incurre d during the American Revolution. The money was to be used to finance France’s war wi th England. However, his real reason for being here, was to gain political favor for France, and spread Illuminism, which he did, through the establishment of ‘Democra tic Clubs.’ Washington said “they would shake the government to its foundations,” while John Quincy Adams, oldest son of the 2nd President John Adams, who became our 6th President in 1825, said that these clubs were “so p erfectly affiliated with the Parisian Jacobins that their origin from a common parent can not possibly be mistaken.” Because of the I Iluminati threat, Washington and Adams lobbied Cong ress to pass the Alien and Sedition Act, which was “designed to protect the Un ited States from the extensive French Jacobin conspiracy, paid agents of which wer e even in high places in the government.” John Quincy Adams"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"In a letter from Adams to Jefferson, dated June 30, 1813, he wrote: “You certainly never felt the terrorism excited by Genet, in 1793 ... when ten thousand people in the streets of Philadelphia, day after day threatened t o drag Washington out of his house, and effect a revolution ... nothing but (a miracle) ... could have saved the United States from a fatal revolution of government.” Thomas Paine, author and political theorist, helped the I Iluminati infiltrate several Masonic lodges. He revealed his loyalty to them whe n his book The Age of Reason was published in 1794, which dealt with the role of rel igion in society. Although he believed in God, he could not accept the entire Bible as bei ng fact. Thomas Paine A second volume was published in 1796. An unofficia l third volume (subtitled: Examination of the Prophecies ) also appeared, which seriously questioned the dei ty and existence of Jesus. In 1937, The Times of London referred to him as “the English Voltaire.” On May 9, 1798, Rev. Jedediah Morse, pastor of the Congregational Church in Charleston, South Carolina preached a sermon at the New North Church in Boston, about the I Iluminati: “Practically all of the civil and eccles iastical establishments of Europe have already been shaken to their foundation s by this terrible organization; the French Revolution itself is doubtless to be traced to its machinations; the successes of the French armies are to be explained on the same g round. The Jacobins are nothing more nor less than the open manifestation of the hi dden system of the I Iluminati. The Order has its branches established and its emissari es at work in America.

When he went to Germany, he was given Weishaupt’s revised conspiracy plans to s tudy, in order to expand the I Iluminati’s influence in the British Isles.

G. W. Snyder, a Lut heran minister, wrote a letter to President Washington and included a copy of Robi son’s book, expressing his concern about the I Iluminati infiltrating the American Masonic lodges. In Washington’s response, dated September 25, 1798, he wrote: “I ha ve heard much about the nefarious and dangerous plan and doctrines of the I Iluminati,” but went on to say that he didn’t believe that they had become involved in the lodges . A subsequent letter by Snyder, requesting a more reassuring answer, resulted in a letter from Washington, dated October 24, 1798, which can be found in The Writings of George Washington (volume 20, page 518, which was prepared under the directio n of the U.S. George Washington Bicentennial Commission and published by the U.S. G overnment Printing Office in 1941).

Around 1807, John Quincy Adams (said to have organi zed the New England Masonic lodges), who later became President in 1825, wrote three letters to Colonel William C.

These letters were allegedly kept at the Rittenburg Square Library in Philadelphia, but have mysteriously vanished. Adams also wrote to Washington , saying that Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton were misusing Masonic lodges for I Iluminati purposes and the worship of Lucifer (which is recor ded in the Adams Chronicles ). George Washington Benjamin Franklin was also accused of being a membe r of the I Iluminati, but there is no concrete proof of this. Jefferson seemed to be t he main focus of everyone’s ire. He was accused by the Federalists of being a Jacobin, and an atheist. There is some evidence to indicate that he did use the Democratic Societies and Jacobin Clubs in his 1796 battle with John Adams for the Presidency. The Rev. Jedediah Morse identified Jefferson as “an Illuminatus.” On July 4, 1812, Rev. Joseph Willard (1761)1827) said in a ser mon in Lancaster, New Hampshire: “There is sufficient evidence that a number of societies, of the I Iluminati, have been established in this land of Go spel light and civil liberty, which were first organized from the grand society, in France.

However, its dubious beginnings, and the fact that many people in influential positi ons have come from their ranks, it certainly is reason enough to take note. But more t han that, when you see their membership cross over into other organizations such as the Bilderbergers, Council on Foreign Relations, and Trilateral Commission; then you begin to see it as a possible breeding ground for people who are favorable to the international agenda that is leading to one)world government.

They know that if they can gra b, control, and mold young minds, then they will have unwitting pawns to do their bid ding, and could be called upon to contribute to their efforts. The early history of t he I Iluminati was nothing more than a seed that was planted. That is why there was a big emphasis on infiltrating educational institutions with their doctrine. As each class gra duated through the educational systems of the world, the more people there were to perpetuate their plans. In time, the I Iluminati knew they would have enough of the right people, in the right places, for them to secretly further their goals. CONGRESS OF VIENNA In 1802, Europe was made up of several hundred stat es, which were dominated by England, Austria, Russia, Prussia and France, which was the most powerful country. In 1804, when Napoleon Bonaparte took over France, his military exploits had led to the complete control of virtually all of Europe.

They were later joined by Sweden, Austria; and in 1813, Prussia joined the co alition to end the siege of Europe, and to “assure its future peace by the re)establish ment of a just equilibrium of the powers.” In 1814, the coalition defeated France, an d in March of that year, marched into Paris.

Throug h the Congress of Vienna (1814) 15), the Rothschilds hoped to create a sort of Leag ue of Nations. From September, 1814 to June, 1815, the four powers of the allied coalition, winners of the Napoleonic Wars, met at the Congress of Vien na, along with a large number of rulers and officials representing smaller states.

Discussion revolved around the cr eation of a Federation of Europe that would establish a group of independent kingdom s which would be tied together through an administrative governing body that would , among other things, provide military defense. In their plan, Switzerland was ma de a neutral state that served as a repository for their finances. King Louis XVIII In March, 1815, Napoleon left Elba, because the pen sion promised him by King Louis XVIII was discontinued, and he believed that Austria was preventing his companion, Marie Louise, and his son, the former Ki ng of Rome (who became the Duke of Reichstadt in Vienna) from being able to join hi m. Plus, he was made aware of the growing discontent with the King. Thus Napoleon ret urned, began the Hundred Days War, and was immediately labeled a “public enemy.” The coalition at the Congress put aside their diplomatic business, and joined in the battle. Shortly before Napoleon’s defeat at Waterloo, negot iations at the Congress of Vienna were completed, and the treaty was signed on June 9, 1815.

The Treaty g uaranteed the sovereignty of any monarch who would adhere to Christian principles in the affairs of State. The Treaty made them a “true and indissoluble brotherhood.” Al exander claimed he got the idea from a conversation with Castlereagh.

Shortly afterward, he was arrested and charged with stealing and indebtedness, and put in jail. The I Iluminati tried him in absentia, convicted him of treason, and ordered fiv e men, led by Richard Howard, an English Illuminist, to execute him. When he was rel eased from jail, he was warned about the plot, and he attempted to flee to Canada. Howard caught him at the border, and took him to Fort Niagara, where he was held for a couple of days. The Freemasons that accompanied Howard, carried him off in a boat, and drowned him in the Niagara River.

One of the three men who carried out the assassination, confessed on his deathbed in 1848. Masonic leaders refused to cooperate with the lengt hy investigation, which didn’t get anywhere, since many of the police officers were Ma sons. The general consensus was that Morgan accidentally drowned himself in Lake On tario. However, the press, religious leaders, temperance and anti)slavery groups, united to condemn the apparent murder. The murder caused over half of the Masons in the no rtheastern United States to break off their alignment with the I Iluminati. The incident led to the creation of the country’s first third party movement, the Anti)Masonic Party (1826)33) in New York. They wanted to stop the aristocratic conspiracy, and prevent al l members of Masonic organizations from public service. Anti)Masonic candidates were e lected to the New York Assembly in 1827. A State Convention in Massachusetts in 1828 saw the establishment of a committee “to inquire how far Freemasonry and French Illumini sm are connected.” The Committee reported at a meeting at Faneuil Hall in Boston (De cember 30, 31, and January 1, 1829), and passed the following resolution: “Resolv ed, on the report of the Committee appointed to inquire how far Freemasonry and French Illuminism are connected, that there is evidence of an intimate connection between the high orders of Masonry and French Illuminism.” A National Convention was held in 1830 in Philadelp hia, and another in Baltimore in 1831, where they nominated William Wirt, former U.S . Attorney General (under Monroe and John Quincy Adams, 1817)1829), as a Presidentia l candidate. They were represented by 116 Anti)Masonic delegates from 13 s tates. The movement caught on mainly in New England and the Mid)Atlantic states. Even though they won quite a few Congressional seats in 1832, Wirt only carried the State of Vermont, while Andrew Jackson, a Mason, won big. The Party was phased out in 1836, because the anti) slavery movement began to overshadow their activities. They merged with the W hig Party (1834)60) in 1838. The Whig Party later assimilated themselves into the De mocratic Party, the Liberty Party (1840)48), the Free Soil Party (1848)54), and the Republican Party. Fifty years after Morgan’s disappearance, Thurlow W eed (1797)1882), owner of the Rochester Telegraph , and Editor of the influential Albany Evening Journal (from 1830) 1863), who helped found the Anti)Masonic Party, pub lished information about Morgan’s death. His grave was discovered in 1881 at Pembroke , in Batavia County, in New York. In the grave was a piece of paper that had the name John Brown written on it. Brown was said to be one of the people involved in the ki lling. A statue was erected in memory of Morgan in Batavia in 1882.

In 1829, they moved to New York, and called their publication the Free Enquirer . At the meeting, she spoke of equal rights, atheism, and free love, as s he promoted a Women’s Auxiliary of the Illuminati. Those present were told that an int ernational movement of subversives was being developed along the lines of I Iluminati principles, who would be used to ferment future wars. They were to be known as ‘comm unists.’ This movement was to be used to make the idea of a one)world government mor e appealing by bringing chaos to the world through war and revolution, so the I Iluminati could step in to create order. Robert Dale Owen In 1843, poet Heinrich Heine, revealed what he knew about this new group, when he wrote a book called Letece , which was a compilation of articles he wrote for the Augsburg Gazette from 1840)1843. A passage from that book read: “Com munism is the secret name of this tremendous adversary which the rule of the proletariat, with all that implies, opposes to the existing bourgeois regime . ..

Incidentally, Greeley, because of his ambition for high public office, and his anti)slavery stand, helped organize the Rep ublican Party in 1854.

It was believed that Weishaupt r ejoined the Catholic Church with a deathbed repentance. Giuseppe Mazzini While attending Genoa University, Mazzini became a 33rd degree Mason, and joined a secret organization known as the Carbonari (their stated goal in 1818: “Our final aim is that of Voltaire and of the French Rev olution– the complete annihilation of Catholicism, and ultimately all Christianity.”), wh ere he became committed to the cause of Italian unity. In 1831, he was exiled to France, where he founded the ‘Young Societies’ movement, which included Giovane Italia (Young Italy), Young England, etc. This group united those who wanted to achieve unifi cation through force. Mazzini moved to England in 1837, then returned to Italy in 1848 to lead the revolution against the Austrians. Again he was exiled. In the 1850’s, he led more revolutionary activities, and through his actions, Italy became united in 186 1, as a single kingdom, rather than the republic envisioned by Mazzini. Mazzini, who became known as the ‘Evil Genius of It aly,’ tried to carry on the activities of the I Iluminati through the Alta Vendita Lodge, the highe st lodge of the Carbonari. From 1814)48, the group known as the Haute Vente Romaine led the activities of most of Europe’s secret societies. In April, 1836, the head of the Haute Vente, whose pseudonym was ‘Nubius,’ wrote to ‘Beppo’: “Mazzini behaves too much like a conspirator of melodrama to suit the obscure role w e resign ourselves to play until our triumph. Mazzini likes to talk about a great many t hings, about himself above all. He never ceases writing that he is overthrowing throne s and altars, that he fertilizes the peoples, that he is the prophet of humanitarianism. ..” In 1860, Mazzini had formed an organization called the ‘Oblonica,’ a name derived from the Latin ‘obelus,’ which means: “I beckon wit h a spit (dagger).” Within this group,"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"he established an inner circle called the Mafia. About 1,000 AD, after the Normans had driven the Ar abs out of Sicily, they established a feudal system. Overseers to guard eac h feudi were chosen from known criminals. Skirmishes between the Barons were fough t by these criminals. Although feudal privileges were abolished in 1812, these ove rseers retained control of the land through leasing arrangements. It was this band of c riminals that Mazzini gave the name ‘Mafia’, which was an acronym for Mazzini, Autorizz a, Furti, Incendi, and Avvelengmenti. Known as the Mafiosi, they were auth orized by Mazzini to commit thefts, arson and murder. It was this organization that came to America during the 1890’s with the beginning of Italian immigration. In 1859, Albert Pike (1809)1891), a lawyer, and lea der of the U.S. Scottish Rite Masonry (who was called the ‘Sovereign Pontiff of U niversal Freemasonry,’ the ‘Prophet of Freemasonry’ and the ‘greatest Freemason of the nineteenth century’), who was fascinated with the idea of a one)world government, was chosen to coordinate I Iluminati activities in the United States. He said they neede d to create a political party that would keep the world fighting, until they could bring pea ce. Pike said it would be done “with tongue and pen, with all our open and secret influe nces, with the purse, and if need be, with the sword...” Albert Pike Pike was born on December 29, 1809, in Boston, went to Harvard, then later served as a Brigadier)General in the Confederate Army. He was appointed by the Confederacy to be the Indian Commissioner in order to create an army of Indian warriors. He became Governor of the Indian territory, and succeeded in creating an army consisting of Chickasaws, Comanches, Creeks, Cherokees, Miamis, O sages, Kansas, and Choctaws. He became known to them as the “faithful pale)face friend and protector.” The savagery of their attacks caused Jefferson Davi s, the President of the Confederacy, to disband the Indian army. After the Civil War, Pi ke was found guilty of treason and jailed, only to be pardoned by President Andrew Joh nson on April 22, 1866, who met with him the next day at the White House. On June 2 0, 1867, Scottish Rite officials conferred upon Johnson, the 4th ) 32nd degrees, and he later went to Boston to dedicate a Masonic Temple.

Pike was a genius, able to read and write in 16 dif ferent languages. A 33rd degree Mason, he was one of the founding fathers, and head of the Ancient Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry. In 1869, he was a top leader i n the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. In 1871, he wrote the 861 page Masonic handbook known as the Morals and Dogma of the Ancient and Accepted Rite of Freemasonry . Pike was said to be a Satanist, who indulged in the occult, and possessed a bracelet he used to summon Lucifer, with whom he had constan t communication. He was the Grand Master of a Luciferian group known as the Ord er of the Palladium (or Sovereign Council of Wisdom), which had been founded in Paris in 1737. Palladism had been brought to Greece from Egypt by Pythagoras in the f ifth century, and it was this cult of Satan that was introduced to the inner circle of th e Masonic lodges. It was aligned with the Palladium of the Templars. In 1801, Issac Long, a Jew, brought a statue of Baphomet (Satan) to Charleston, South Carolina, whe re he helped established the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite. Pike, his succe ssor, changed the name to the New and Reformed Palladian Rite (or Reformed Palladium) . The Order contained two degrees: 1) Adelph (or Brother), and 2) Companion o f Ulysses (or Companion of Penelope). Pike’s right)hand man was Phileas Walder , from Switzerland, who was a former Lutheran minister, a Masonic leader, occulti st, and spiritualist. His other closest aids were Gallatin Mackey (a Masonic leader), Longf ellow, and Holbrook. Pike, along with Mazzini, Lord Henry Palmerston of England (178 4)1865, 33rd degree Mason), and Otto von Bismarck from Germany (33rd Mason, 1815)18 98), intended to use the Palladian Rite to create a Satanic umbrella group t hat would tie all Masonic groups together. Because of Mazzini’s revolutionary activities in Eu rope, the I Iluminati had to again go underground. Pike established Supreme Councils i n Charleston, South Carolina; Rome, Italy (led by Mazzini); London, England (led by Palmerston); and Berlin, Germany (led by Bismarck). He set up 23 subordinate councils in strategic places throughout the world, including five Grand Central Directories in Washington, DC (North America), Montevideo (South America), Naples (Europ e), Calcutta (Asia), and Mauritius (Africa), which were used to gather information. Al l of these branches have been the secret headquarters for the I Iluminati’s activities ever since. "},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":" Otto von Bismarck In a letter dated January 22, 1870, Mazzini wrote t o Pike: “We must allow all of the federations to continue j ust as they are, with their systems, their central authorities and diverse mode s of correspondence between high grades of the same rite, organized as they are at present, but we must create a super rite, which will remain unknown, to which we will call those Masons of high degree whom we shall select (obvious ly referring to the New and Reformed Palladian Rite). With regard to our brothe rs in Masonry, these men must be pledged to the strictest secrecy. Through t his supreme rite, we will govern all Freemasonry which will become the one In ternational Center, the more powerful because its direction will be unknown .” In another letter, dated August 15, 1871, Pike wrot e to Mazzini: “We shall unleash the Nihilists and the atheists, a nd we shall provoke a formidable social cataclysm which in all its horror will show clearly to the nations the effect of absolute atheism, the origin of savag ery, and of the most bloody turmoil. Then everywhere, the citizens, obliged to defend themselves against the world minority of revolutionaries, will exterminate those destroyers of civilization, and the multitude, disillusioned with Christianity, whose deistic spirits will from that moment be without compass, anxious for an idea l, but without knowing where to render its adoration, will receive the pur e light through the universal manifestation which will result from the general re actionary movement which will follow the destruction of Christianity and atheism, both conquered and exterminated at the same time.” Another part of this letter was discovered in 1949, which graphically outlined plans for three world wars and at least two revolutions. The first world war was to enable communistic atheism to destroy the czarist governme nt in Russia. This was accomplished. The second world war was to begin by pitting Great Britain against Germany, in order to destroy Naziism, and advance t he cause of Zionism, so that Israel"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"could become a nation. This was accomplished. After this war, Communism was to be made strong enough to begin taking over weaker gove rnments. In 1945, at the Potsdam Conference between Truman, Churchill, and Stalin, R ussia was given a chunk of Europe, and that helped to sweep the tide of Commun ism into China. The plan also called for a third world war, which is to be ignite d by firing up the aggression between the Zionists (Israel) and the Arab world, who will destroy each other, bringing the rest of the world into a final conflict. This conflict will be engineered to produce complete social, political, and economic chaos; out of which will em erge an I Iluminati)controlled world government. According to William Guy Carr, a retired Canadian N aval Commander, in his book Pawns in the Game (he also wrote Red Fog Over America ), he said that for a short time this letter had been on display in the British Muse um Library in London, where he wrote a copy of it. The British Museum has said that they never had such a letter in their collection. It was later discovered that Carr got t he information from a book called The Mystery of Freemasonry Unveiled by Jose Maria Caro y Rodriguez, the Archbishop of Santiago, and the Cardinal of Chile. Some researche rs believe the second letter to be fraudulent, and had been written much later than th e first part, since the word ‘Fascism’ was not used until 1921, and the Arab/Jewish proble m did not exist until after the 1917 Balfour Declaration. But then again, if they indeed planned and initiated these events, the document could very well be authentic.

Yes, Lucifer is God, and unfortunately Adonay is also God. For t he eternal law is that there is no light without shade, no beauty without ugliness, no white without black, for the absolute can only exist as two Gods: darkness being necessary to light to serve as its foil as the pedestal is necessary to the sta tue, and the brake to the locomotive... ...Thus, the doctrine of Satanism is a heresy; and the true and pure philosophic religion is the belief in Lucifer, the equal of Adonay; but Lucifer, God of Light and God of Good, is struggling for humanit y against Adonay, the God of darkness and evil.” "},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWO FINANCIAL BACKGROUND THE BEGINNING OF MONETARY CONTROL Napoleon said: “When a government is dependent for money upon the bankers, they and not the leaders of the government control the s ituation, since the hand that gives is above the hand that takes ... financiers are withou t patriotism and without decency...” Karl Marx said in the Communist Manifesto : “Money plays the largest part in determining the course of history.” The Rothschilds found out early, that when you control the money, you basically control everything else.

When the bankers in Great Britain heard this, the British Parliament passed a law prohibiting the currency, f orcing them to accept the debt money issued by them. Contrary to what history teac hes, the American Revolution was not ignited by a tax on tea. According to Benjamin Franklin, it was because “the conditions were so reversed that the era of prosper ity ended.” He said: “The Colonies would gladly have borne the little tax on tea and o ther matters had it not been the poverty caused by the bad influence of the English bankers on the Parliament, which has caused in the Colonies hatred of England and th e Revolutionary War.” "},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":" Benjamin Franklin In 1787, our new Constitution gave Congress the pow er to “coin money, (and) regulate the value thereof (Article 1, Section 8).” After Great Britain tried to destroy and control the currency of our new country, Congress r ealized the danger of fiat, or paper money created by law. In 1775, paper money had been issued to finance the war, and independent state legislatures passed laws requirin g citizens to accept it as legal tender. Since it was created from nothing, and not backed by any precious metal, inflation developed. By the end of the war, it took 500 paper dollars to get one silver dollar. Our forefathers wrote in Article I, Section 10, of the U.S. Constitution: “No State shall enter into any treaty, alliance or confederat ion; grant letters of marque and reprisal; coin money; emit bills of credit; make an y thing by gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts; pass any bill of attainder, ex post facto law, or law impairing the obligation of contracts, or grant any title of nobi lity.” Alexander Hamilton, an Illuminist, and agent of Eur opean bankers, had immigrated to the colonies in 1772 from the British colony of Nevis, on the Leeward Islands in the British West Indies. He married the daughter of Gen . Philip Schuyler, one of the most influential families of New York. In 1789 he was ap pointed Secretary of the Treasury. Hamilton and Robert Morris successfully convinced t he new Congress not to take this power literally, enabling the Bank of North America to be established in 1781, which was similar to the Bank of England. At the time, Am erica had a foreign debt of $12,000 (in money borrowed from Spain, France, Holland, and private interests in Germany), and a domestic debt of $42,000.

His Plan called for Congress to create a Central Banking system, with a main office in Philadelphia, and smaller branches located in important cities throughout the country. It would b e used to deposit government funds and tax collections, and to issue bank notes to inc rease the money supply needed to finance the country’s growth. This Bank of the Unit ed States would have a capital stock plan of $10 million, with 4/5’s to be owned by private investors, and 1/5 by the U. S. Government. It would be administered by a President , and 25 Board of Directors, with 20 to be elected by the stockholders, and 5 appoint ed by the government. Central Banking was initiated by international bank er William Paterson in 1691, when he obtained the Charter for the Bank of Englan d, which put the control of England’s money in a privately owned company which had the right to issue notes payable on demand against the security of bank loan s to the crown. One of their first transactions was to loan 1.2 million pounds at 8% i nterest to William of Orange to help the king pay the cost of his war with Louis XIV of France. Paterson said: “The bank hath benefit of interest on all monies which it creates out of nothing.” Reginald McKenna, British Chancellor of the Exchequer (or Treasury), said 230 years later: “The banks can and do create money ...

If we run into such de bts, we (will then) be taxed in our meat and our drink, in our necessities and in our c omforts, in our labor and in our amusements.

Alexander Hamilton became a very rich man. He and Aaron Burr helped establish the Ma nhattan Co. in New York City, which developed into a very prosperous banking inst itution.

Because he supported the Bank of the United States, he threatened: “Either the applicati on for renewal of the Charter is granted, or the United States will find itself in a most disastrous war.” He then ordered British troops to “teach these impudent Americans a lesson. Bring them back to Colonial status.” This brought on the War of 1812, our secon d war with England, which facilitated the rechartering of the Bank of the United States. The war raised our national debt from $45 million to $127 million.

The new charter allowed it to operate another 20 years, rai sed its capital stock to $35 million, authorized the creation of bank branches, and the i ssuing of notes with denominations no smaller than $5.00. The new bank now had the pow er “to control the entire fiscal structure of the country.” The bank was run by the I Iluminati, through such international banker ‘front men’ as John Jacob Astor, Stephen Gir ard, and David Parish (a Rothschild agent for the Vienna branch of the family).

His slogan was: “Let the people rule.” Jackson maintained: “If Congress has the right under the Constitution to issue paper money, it was given them to be used by themselves, not to be delegated to individuals or to corporations.” Jackson said that the control of a central bank “would be exercised by a few over the political conduct of th e many by first acquiring that control over the labor and earnings of the great body of pe ople.” During the 1828 presidential campaign, Jackson said in an address before a group of bankers: “You are a den of vipers. I intend to rout you out and by the Eternal God I will rout you out.” He went on to say: “If the people only understood the rank injust ice of our Money and Banking system, there would be a revolution before morning.” Jackso n said that if such a Bank would continue to control “our currency, receiving our pu blic monies, and holding thousands of our citizens in dependence, it would be more formid able and dangerous than the naval and military power of the enemy...” Andrew Jackson "},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"After fiscal mismanagement by its first President, former Secretary of the Navy, Captain William Jones, the Bank was forced to call in loans and foreclosed on mortgages, which caused bankruptcy, a price collaps e, unemployment and a depression.

Biddle threatened: “Should Jackson ve to it, I shall veto him!” Jackson did veto the Charter, and abolished the Bank in 1832.

Jackson became the first President of the United States to be censured, which was done in March, 1834, “for removing the government’s deposit s from the Bank of the United States without the express authorization of the Uni ted States Congress.” It is quite obvious that he did it because of the “abuses and c orruptions” of the Bank, and the censure was later reversed by the Senate in 1837.

Russia had already indicated the ir support for Lincoln, but wanted something more to send their large navy to defend t he country. On January 1, 1863, as a gesture of goodwill, Lincoln issued his Emancipat ion Proclamation to free the slaves, just as the Czar had done with the serfs in 1861. O n September 8, 1863, at the request of President Lincoln and Secretary of State William H.

A system of private banks was to receive charters from the fede ral government which would give them the authorization to issue National Bank Notes .

In 1867, in his book, The History of the U.S. Secret Service , he admitted delivering Booth’s diary to Stanton, and on another occasion, testified that the diary was intact when it was in his possession.

Besides Edward H. Harriman’s railroad empire, he financed Standard Oil for John D. Rockefeller (1839 )1937), and Andrew Carnegie’s (1835)1919) steel empire. By the turn of the centur y, Schiff was firmly entrenched in the banking community, and ready to fulfill his role as the point man in the I Iluminati’s plan to control our economic system, weaken Christianity , create racial tension, and to recruit members to get them elected to Congress and appoint ed to various government agencies.

John Pierpont Morgan, or as he was better known, J. P. Morgan, was born on April 17, 1837. He became his father’s representative in New York in 1860. In 1862, he had his own firm, known as J. Pierpont Morgan and Co. I n 1863, he liquidated, and became a partner with Charles H. Dabney (who represented G eorge Peabody and Co.), and established a firm known as Dabney, Morgan and Co. He later teamed up with Anthony J. Drexel (son of the founder of the most influenti al banking house in Philadelphia), in a firm known as Drexel, Morgan and Co. Morgan also be came a partner in Drexel and Co. in Philadelphia. In 1869, Morgan and Drexel met wit h the Rothschilds in London, and through the Northern Securities Corporation, began consolidating the Rothschild’s power and influence in the United States. Morgan co ntinued the partnership that began when his father acted as a joint agent for the Roth schilds and the U.S. Government.   Anthony J. Dre xel  Thomas W. Lamont During the Civil War, J. P. Morgan had sold the Uni on Army defective carbine rifles, and it was this government money that helped build his Guaranty Trust Co. of New York. In 1880, he began financing and reorganizing the railroads. After his father died in 1890, and Drexel died in 1893, the Temporary Nation al Economic Committee revealed that J. P. Morgan held only a 9.1% interest in his own firm. George Whitney owned 1.9%, and H. B. Davison held 1.2%, however, the Cha rles W. Steele Estate held 36.6%, and Thomas W. Lamont (whose son, Corliss, was an ac tive communist) had 34.2%. Researchers believe that the I Iluminati controlled the company through these shar es. In 1901, Morgan bought out Andrew Carnegie’s vast s teel operation for $500,000,000 to merge the largest steel companies i nto one big company known as the United States Steel Corporation (in which, for a ti me, the Rockefellers were major stockholders). A speech by Senator Norris which was printed in the Congressional Record of November 30, 1941, said: “J. P.

Mr. President, we are gradually reaching a time, if we have not already reached that point, when the business of the countr y is controlled by men who can be named on the fingers of one hand, because those men control the money of the Nation, and that control is growing at a rapid rate.” The House of Morgan grew larger in 1959, when the G uaranty Trust Co. of New York merged with the J. P. Morgan and Co., to form the Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. They had four branch offices, and foreign offices i n London, Paris, Brussels, Frankfurt, Rome, and Tokyo. The firm of Morgan, Stanley, and C o. was also under their control.   Paul Warburg  Eric Warburg Paul Moritz Warburg (1868)1932), and his brother Fe lix (1871)1937), came to the United States from Frankfurt in 1902, buying into t he partnership of Kuhn, Loeb and Co. with the financial backing of the Rothschilds. They had been trained at the family banking house, M. M. Warburg and Co. (run by their father Moritz M. Warburg, 1838) 1910), a Rothschild)allied bank in Frankfurt, Hambu rg, and Amsterdam, which had been founded in 1798 by their great)grandfather. Paul (s aid to be worth over $2.5 million when he died), married Nina Loeb, the daughter of S olomon Loeb (the younger sister of Schiff’s wife); while Felix, in March, 1895, marrie d Frieda Schiff, the daughter of Jacob Schiff. Their brother Max (1867)1946), a major financier of the Russian Revolution (who in his capacity as Chief of Intelligence in Germany’s Secret Service, helped Lenin cross Germany into Russia in a sealed train) and later Hi tler, ran the Hamburg bank until 1938, when the Nazis took over. The Nazis, who didn ’t want the Jews running the banks, changed its name to Brinckmann, Wirtz and Co .

The mastermin d of both plans was Alfred Rothschild of London.” Professor E. R. A.

Schiff, in turn, gave it to James Stillman, President of the National City B ank in New York City. Warburg had graduated from the University of Hamburg in 1886, a nd studied English central banking methods, while working in a London brokerage house. In 1891, he studied French banking methods; and from 1892)93, traveled the wor ld to study central banking applications. The bottom line, was that he was the foremost authority in the world on central banking. It is interesting to note, that th e fifth plank in the 1848 Communist Manifesto had to do with central banking. In 1906, Frank A. Vanderlip, of the National City B ank, convinced many of New York’s banking establishment, that they needed a ba nker)controlled central bank, that could serve the nation’s financial system.

After making some compromises with A ldrich, and Speaker of the House Joseph Cannon, at a meeting in a hotel room at the Arlington House, his bill became known as the Vreeland Substitute. It called for the acceptance of asset currency, but only in cases of emergency, and the currency would be based on commercial paper rather than bonds. It passed in the House, 184 )145 ; but when it got to the Senate, Aldrich moved against it, and pushed for further co mpromises. The Aldrich)Vreeland Bill, called the Emergency Currency Act, was passed on May 30, 1908, and led to the creation of the National Monetary Commission, which was made up of members of Congress. Now, any monetary legislation sent to Con gress, would have to go through this group first. The Bill approved by the National Monetary Commissi on was known as the Aldrich Bill, and formed the legislative base for the Feder al Reserve Act. It was introduced as an amendment to the Republican sponsored Payne)Aldr ich Tariff Bill, in order to have Republican support. It was based on Warburg’s plan, except it would only have 15 districts; half of the directors on the district le vel would be chosen by the banks, a third by the stockholders, and a sixth by the other direc tors. On the National Board: two chosen by each district; nine chosen by the stockho lders; and seven ex)officio members to be the Governor, Chairman of the Board, two Depu ty Governors, Secretary of the Treasury, Secretary of Commerce and Labor, Secretar y of Agriculture, and Comptroller of the Currency. Most people were against the Bill, because it finally identified the banking institution as a central bank, and the Demo cratic Party opposed it in the 1912 Party platform. Aldrich was appointed as head of the National Monet ary Commission, and from 1908)10, at a cost of $300,000, this 16)man committ ee traveled around Europe to study the central banking system. In 1910, Warburg gave a speech entitled, “A United Reserve Bank of the United States,” which called for a United Reserve Bank to be located in Washington, D.C., having the capital of $100 million.

As an example, he said, that when wheat was harvested, and merchants didn’t have the cash on hand to buy and s tore a large supply of grain, the farmers would sell the grain for whatever they coul d get. This would cause the price of wheat to greatly fluctuate, forcing the farmer to t ake a loss.

So, the I Iluminati went to Plan B, which was the second vers ion hammered out at the Jekyll Island summit. The National Citizens League publicl y withdrew their support of the Aldrich Bill, and the move was on to disguise it, s o that it could get through Congress. Once the new version was ready, they were a little apprehensive about introducing it in Congress, because even if it would be passed by Congress, President Taft would veto it, so they had to wait until they could get t heir own man elected. That man was Woodrow Wilson. The Democrats, with the exception of Grover Clevela nd’s election, had been out of power since 1869. Being a ‘hungry’ Party, the I Iluminati found them easier to infiltrate. During the late 1800’s, they began the process of c hanging the Democrats from conservative to liberal, and the Republicans, from liberal to conservative. Wilson graduated from Princeton University in 1879, studied law at the University of Virginia, and received his doctorate degree from Jo hns Hopkins in 1886. He taught Political Science and History at Bryn Mawr and Wesl eyan, and in 1902, became President of Princeton.

The Russian pogroms of 1881 and 1882, in which thousands of Russians were kille d; and religious persecution and anti)Semitism in Poland, Romania, and Bulgaria in t he early 1890’s, began three decades of immigration into the United States by th ousands of Jews. By the turn of the century, a half)million Jews had arrived to the por t cities of New York, Baltimore, and Boston. It was the Democrats who initiated a progra m to get them registered to vote. Humanitarian committees were set up by Schiff and t he Rothschilds, such as the Hebrew Immigration Aid Society, and the B’nai B’rit h, so when the Jews arrived, they were made naturalized citizens, registered Democrat , then shuffled off to other large cities, such as Chicago, Philadelphia, Detroit and Los Angeles, where they were given financial help to find a place to live, food, and c lothing. This is how the Jews became a solid Democratic voting bloc, and it was these vote s that would be needed to elect Wilson to the Presidency.  William Howard Taft  Theodore Roosevelt In 1912, with President William Howard Taft running for re)election against Wilson, the I Iluminati needed some insurance. They got it by urg ing another Republican, former President, Theodore Roosevelt (1901)09) to run on t he Progressive ticket. Taft had served as Roosevelt’s Secretary of War (1905)09), and was chosen by Roosevelt to succeed him as President. Now, Roosevelt was runnin g again. Advocating the ‘New Nationalism,’ Roosevelt said: “My hat is in the rin g ... the fight is on and I am stripped to the buff.” Identified as ‘anti)business’ because of his stand against corporations and trusts, his proposals for reorganizing the governme nt were attacked by the I Iluminati) controlled New York Times as “super)socialism.” His ‘Bull Moose’ Platform sa id: “We are opposed to the so)called Aldrich Currency Bill because its provisions would place our currency and credit system in private hands, no t subject to effective public control.” Frank Munsey and George Perkins, of the J.

Remember, the secon d version of the Bill prepared at Jekyll Island was to be an alternative, so public a ttention was turned against the Aldrich Bill. Wilson, an aristocrat, having socialistic vie ws, was in favor of an independent reserve system, because he didn’t trust the ‘common men’ which made up Congress. However, publicly, he promised to “free the poor pe ople of America from control by the rich,” and to have a money system that wouldn’t be under the control of Wall Street’s International Bankers. In fact, in the summer of 19 12, when he accepted the nomination as the Democratic candidate for the Presidency, he said: “A concentration of the control of credit ... may at any time become infinitely dan gerous to free enterprise.” According to the Federal Reserve’s historical narrative, the shift in Wilson’s point of view was “a combination of political realities and his own lack of knowledge about banking and finance (and) after his election to the Presidency, Wilson relied on others for more expert advice on the currency question.” William Jennings Bryan "},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":" Because of the voting split in the Republican Party , not only was Woodrow Wilson able to win the Presidency, but the Democrats gaine d control of both houses in Congress.

Now Plan B was set into motion. Remember, the National Citizen s League, headquartered in Chicago, had already announced their opposition to the Aldrich Bill, now the Wall Street banking interests had come out against the Glass Bi ll, which was actually the Aldrich Bill in disguise. The Wall Street crowd was generally referred to as the ‘money trust.’ However, a 1912 Wall Street Journal editorial said that the te rm ‘money trust’ was just a reference to J. P. Morgan. The suspicion of the ‘money trust’ peaked in 1912, during an investigation by a House banking subcommittee which revealed that twelve banks in New York, Boston, and Chicago, had 746 interlocking directorships in 134 corporations. Rep. Robert L. Henry of Texas said that for the pas t five years, the nation’s financial resources had been “concentrated in the city of New York (where they) now dominate more than 75 percent of the moneyed interests of Am erica...” On December 13, 1911, George McC.

It is a privately held corporation owned by stockholders. T hat is why the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (and all the others) is listed in the Dun and Bradstreet Reference Book of American Business (Northeast, Region 1, Man hattan/Bronx). According to Article I, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution, only Congress has the right to issue money and regulate its value, so it is illegal for privat e interests to do so. Yet, it happened, and because of a provision in the Act, the Class A stoc kholders were to be kept a secret, and not to be revealed. R. F. McMaster, who publish ed a newsletter called The Reaper , through his Swiss and Saudi Arabian contacts, was a ble to find out which banks held a controlling interest in the Reserve: the Rothschild Banks of London and Berlin; Lazard Brothers Bank of Paris; Israel Moses Seif Bank of I taly; Warburg Bank of Hamburg and Amsterdam; Lehman Brothers Bank of New York; Kuhn, Loeb, and Co. of New York; Chase Manhattan Bank of New York; and Goldman, Sach s of New York. These interests control the Reserve through about 300 sto ckholders. Because of the way the Reserve was organized, whoev er controls the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, controls the system, Abou t 90 of the 100 largest banks are in this district. Of the reportedly 203,053 shares of the New York bank: Rockefeller’s National City Bank had 30,000 shares; Morgan’s Firs t National Bank had 15,000 shares; Chase National, 6,000 shares; and the Natio nal Bank of Commerce (Morgan Guaranty Trust), 21,000 shares. A June 15, 1978 Senate Report called “Interlocking Directorates Among the Major U.S. Corporations” revealed that five New York bank s had 470 interlocking directorates with 130 major U.S. corporations: Citicorp (97), J. P. Morgan Co. (99), Chase Manhattan (89), Manufacturers Hanover (89), and Che mical Bank (96). According to Eustace Mullins, these banks are major stock holder s in the FED. In his book World Order , he said that these five banks are “controlled fro m London.” Mullins said: “Besides its controlling interest in the Federal Reserve Ban k of New York, the Rothschilds had developed important financial interests in other pa rts of the United States ... The entire Rockefeller empire was financed by the Rothschilds. ” A May, 1976 report of the House Banking and Currenc y Committee indicated: “The Rothschild banks are affiliated with Manufacturers Hanover of London in which they"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"hold 20 percent ... and Manufacturers Hanover Trust of New York.” The Report also revealed that Rothschild Intercontinental Bank, Ltd ., which consisted of Rothschild banks in London, France, Belgium, New York, and Ams terdam, had three American subsidiaries: National City Bank of Cleveland, Firs t City National Bank of Houston, and Seattle First National Bank. It is believed, that t he Rothschilds hold 53% of the stock of the U.S. Federal Reserve. Each year, billions of dollars are ‘earned’ by Clas s A stockholders, from U.S. tax dollars which go to the FED to pay interest on bank loans. How Our Gold Reserves Have Been Manipulated The Coinage Act of 1792 established a dollar consis ting of 371.25 grains of pure silver, but was later replaced with a gold dollar c onsisting of 25.8 grains of gold. In 1873, the Coinage Act was passed, prohibiting the use of Silver as a form of currency, because the quantity being discovered was driving t he value down. In 1875, after temporarily suspending gold convertibility during t he Civil War greenback period, the U.S. was put more firmly on the gold standard by th e Gold Standard Act of 1900. From 1900 to 1933, gold was coined by the U.S. Mint, and our paper currency was tied into the amount of gold held in the U.S. Treasury reserv es. In July, 1927, the directors of the Bank of England , the New York Federal Reserve Bank, and the German Reichsbank, met to plan a way to get the gold moved out of the United States, and it was this movement of gold whi ch helped trigger the depression. By 1928, nearly $500 million in gold was transferred t o Europe. President Franklin D. Roosevelt accepted the advice of England’s leading economist, John Maynard Keynes (1883)1946), a membe r of the I Iluminati, who said that deficit spending would be a shot in the arm to the economy. Most of the New Deal spending programs to fight economic depression, wer e based on Keynes theories on deficit spending, and financed by borrowing against future taxes. In 1910, Lenin said: “The surest way to overthrow an established social order is to debauch its currency.” Nine years later, Keynes wrote: “Lenin was certainl y right, there is no more positive, or subtler, no surer means of overturning the existing basis of society than to debauch the currency ... The process engages all of the hidden forces of economic law on the side of destruction, and does it in a manner that not one m an in a million is able to diagnose.” "},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"   Franklin D. Roosevelt John Maynard Keynes A Presidential Executive Order by Roosevelt on Apri l 5, 1933, required all the people to exchange their gold coins, gold bullion, and gol d)backed currency, for money that was not redeemable in precious metals. The Gold Res erve Act of 1934, known as the Thomas Amendment, which amended the Act of May 12, 1933, made it illegal to possess any gold currency (which was rescinded Dece mber 31, 1974) . Gold coinage was withdrawn from circulation, and kept in the for m of bullion. Just as the public was to return all their gold to the U.S. Government, so wa s the Federal Reserve. However, while the people received $20.67 an ounce in paper money issued by the Federal Reserve, the Reserve was paid in Gold Certificates. Now the Federal Reserve, and the I Iluminati, had control of all the gold in the count ry. In 1934, the value of gold increased to $35 an ounc e, which produced a $3 billion profit for the Government. But when the price of go ld increases, the value of the dollar decreases. Our dollar has not been worth 100 cents since 1933, when we were taken off of the Gold Standard. In 1974, our dollar was w orth 22)1/2 cents, and in 1983 it was only worth 38 cents. In 2002, it took $13.88 to buy what cost $1.00 in 1933. Since our money supply had been limited to the amount of gold in Treasury reserves, when the value of the dollar decreased, more money was print ed. The first United Nations Monetary and Financial Con ference, held in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, from July 1 to July 22, 1944, which was under the direction of Harry Dexter White (CFR member, and undercover Russian sp y), established the policies of the International Monetary Fund. Its goals were to strip the United States of its gold reserves by giving it to other nations; and to merg e with their industrial capabilities; as well as their economic, social, educational and rel igious policies; to facilitate a one) world government. Because of paying off foreign obligations and stren gthening foreign economies, between 1958 and 1968, the amount of gold bullion i n the possession of the U.S. Treasury dropped by 52%. Of the amount remaining, $ 12 billion was reserved by law for backing the paper money in circulation. Our money h ad been backed by a 25% gold reserve in accordance to a law that was passed in 1 945, but it was rescinded in 1968. The amount of gold slipped from 653.1 million troy ounces in 1957, to 311.2 million"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"ounces in 1968, which according to the Treasury Dep artment, was due to sales to foreign banking institutions, sales to domestic pro ducers, and the buying and selling of gold on the world market to stabilize prices. This was a loss of 341.9 million troy ounces. In August, 1971, gold was used only for wor ld trade, because foreign countries wouldn’t accept U.S. dollars. As of November, 1981, sources had indicated that the gold reserve had dropped to 264.1 million troy ounces. Title 31 of the U.S. Code, requires an annual physi cal inventory of our gold supply, but a complete audit was never done, so officially, nobody knows what has occurred. After World War II, America had 70% of the World’s supply of loose gold, but today, we may have less than 7%. Sen. Jesse Helms seemed to t hink that the OPEC nations have our gold, while others believe that 70% of the worl d’s gold supply is being held by the World Bank, which is dominated by the financial gri p of the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers. Jesse Helms Some years ago, I had been contacted by a gentleman in Michigan, whose research indicated that counterfeit $5,000 and $10,000 Feder al Reserve Notes had been used to steal U.S. gold reserves. Illegal to own, these not es are actually checks which are used to transfer ownership of large amounts of gold with out actually moving the gold itself. Using public records, he found the serial numbers o f the bills which were originally printed, and discovered that there are now more in existence. It has been reported that 40% (13,000 tons) of the world’s gold is five levels below street level, in a sub)basement of the New York Fed eral Reserve Bank, behind a 90)ton revolving door. Some of it is American)owned, but m ost is owned by the central banks of other countries. It is stored in separate cubicl es, and from time to time, is moved from one cubicle to another to satisfy international tra nsactions.

On the 1929 series of notes, it read: “Redeemable in gold on demand at the United States Treasury, or in gold or lawful money at any Federal Reserve Bank.” This was just like the Silver Certif icate, which was guaranteed by a dollar in silver that was on deposit. On the 1934 s eries of notes, it read: “This note is legal tender for all debts, public and private, and is redeemable in lawful money at the United States Treasury, or at any Federal Reserve B ank.” The 1950 series bore the same information, but reduced it to three lines, an d reduced the size of the type. In the 1953 series, the wording was totally removed, altho ugh the bottom portion contained a promise to “pay the bearer on demand.” However, in 1963, even that message was removed, and our dollars became nothing more than w orthless pieces of paper because they no longer met the legal requirements of a note , which meant it had to list an issuing bank, and amount payable, a payee or ‘bearer,’ and a time for payment, which was ‘on demand.’ Lyndon B. Johnson Since 1933, the Reserve has been printing too much money, compared to the declining Gross National Product (GNP). The GNP is the accumulated values of services and goods produced in the country. If the GNP is 4% , then the money produced should only be about 5)6%, thus insuring e nough money to keep the goods produced by the GNP in circulation. Additional soci al services, which are promised during election year rhetoric to gain votes, increa se the Federal Budget, so more money is printed. Then the Government will cut the Budget , establish wage and price controls. The extra money in circulation decreases the value of the dollar, and prices go up. Simply put, too much money in circulation causes in flation, and that is what the Reserve is doing, purposely printing too much money in orde r to destroy the economy. On the other hand, if they would stop printing money, our economy would collapse."},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"The Reserve is responsible for setting the interest rate that member banks can borrow from the Reserve, thus controlling the inter est rates of the entire country. So, what it boils down to, is that the Federal Reserve determines the amount of money needed, which is created by the International Banke rs out of nothing. Besides the face value, they charge the government 3¢ to produce eac h bill. The Federal government pays the Reserve in bonds (which are also printed b y the Reserve), and then pay the bonds off at a high rate of interest. That interest will very soon become the largest item in the Federal Budget. William McChesney Martin, a member of the Council o n Foreign Relations (CFR), and Chairman of the Federal Reserve (FED) during th e ‘New Frontier’ years of the Kennedy Administration, testified to the Federal Ba nking Committee, that the value of the dollar was being scientifically brought down ea ch year by 3)3)1/2%, in order to allow wages to go up. The reasoning behind this, was that the people were being made to think that they were getting more, when in fact the y were actually getting less.

When Wilson was President, the debt was about $1 billion, and in 19 74, the debt was about $1 trillion. In 1937, Rep. Charles G.

For 40 years the system, while freely using the money of t he government, has not made a proper accounting.” Patman, said that the Federal O pen Market Committee (who, in addition to the Board of Governors, decide the coun try’s monetary policy) is “one of the most secret societies.

Johannes Witteveen, Managing Director of the United Nation’s International Monetary Fund, that the IMF “ought to evolve into a World Ce ntral Bank ... to prevent inflation.” Dr. H. A. Murkline, Director of the International I nstitute University in Irving, Texas, wrote in World Oil: 1976 that he projected that the Federal Government coul d only hold out till the end of 1981. Dow Theory Letters, Inc. reported that by 1982, the cost of dealing with the national debt “would eat up all th e government tax money available.” H. Johannes Witteveen The Robbins Report of January 15, 1978, said: “If Carter introduces B ancor, which will be the yielding of our dollar to the ECU (Euro pean Currency Unit), this is what will happen: look for hyperinflation and collapse of all the world’s paper money before 1985.” Julian Snyder said in the International Money Line of February, 1978: “The United States is trying to solve its problem throug h currency depreciation (debasement) ... it will not work. If the crash does not occur t his year, it could be postponed until 1982.”"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"On March 13, 1979, while meeting at Strasbourg, Fra nce, the Parliament of Europe, which governs the European Economic Community (Comm on Market), oversaw the establishment of a new European money system. Known as the ECU, it was backed by 20% of the participating countries’ gold reserves ( about 3,150 tons). What little strength our dollar had, came from the fact that all nations buying oil from OPEC, had to use U.S. dollars. Then came the word in March, 1980, fr om Arab diplomatic sources at the United Nations that the Chase Manhattan Bank was ma king plans to drop the dollar in lieu of the ECU. Dr. Franz Pick, a well known authority on world cur rency, said in December, 1979, in the Silver and Gold Report : “The most serious problem we face today is the debasement of our currency by the government. The g overnment will continue to debase the dollar until ... within 12)24, months it will shrink to 1 cent ... at which time Washington will be forced to create the new hard cu rrency ... A currency reform is nothing but a fancy name for state bankruptcy ... A currency reform completes the expropriation of all kinds of savings ... it will w ipe out all public and private bonds, most pensions; all annuities, and all endowments.” Against all odds, our economy has continued to hang on, even though financial analysts have continued to forecast disastrous cond itions.   Bob Kerrey  Bill Cl inton In 1993, Sen. Bob Kerrey (Democrat, NE) promised to support President Bill Clinton’s Budget Plan, if Clinton would appoint a C ommittee to study the condition of the American economy. The President established a 32)me mber bipartisan committee and in August, 1994, they issued their report. Accordin g to the committee’s findings, by the year 2012, unless drastic changes are made, we won’ t even be able to pay the interest on the national debt. Knowing this, the federal gov ernment has allowed the trend to continue, almost as if they’re trying to run our ec onomy into the ground. It seems obvious that the destruction of the American econom y has been part of a deliberate plot to financially enslave our nation. "},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"The New Money Dr. Pick said that late 1983 or early 1984 was the target date for the ‘new money.’ Carl Mintz, a staff member of the House Banking Com mittee, had said: “I believe it’s in the billions of dollars, and it’s buried in lots of places.\" In the late 1970’s, it was believed to have already been printed, and stored at the Fed eral Reserve Emergency Relocation Facility in Culpepper, Virginia, which is built int o the side of a mountain, and would be able to continue functioning during the aftermath o f a nuclear or natural disaster; and the 200,000 sq. ft.

It is believed, that when our monetary system is finally destroyed, a reorganization will occur within the confines of a world government, and new money will be issued. Rep. Ron Paul, Republican from Texas, who was on th e Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs, wrote about the new mone y in a letter to Charles T. Roberts, Executive Vice)President of the Hull State Bank in Texas: “In a closed briefing for the members of the House Banking Committee on November 2nd, representatives of the Bureau of Engr aving and Printing, the Federal Reserve, and the Secret Service described p lans for making changes in Federal Reserve Notes beginning in 1985 (although t he long range target is 1988) ...

Over $3 million had been spent under ‘counterfeit p revention’ authority for the development of the new money, which according to th e Currency Design Act (HR6005) hearings would be issued by the Federal Reserve Boa rd. It was first reported by the Patterson Organization in Cincinnati, Ohio, that in a July, 1983 market survey in Buena Park, California, people were shown proposed design s for “new U.S. dollar bills.” The variations shown, consisted of each denomination be ing a different color; Federal Reserve seals replaced with a design utilizing refl ective ink; and other optical devices like holograms (a process which produces a three)di mensional image which can change color depending on the angle it is viewed), and mul tilayer diffraction gratings (similar to a hologram); as well as bills containing metal secu rity threads, and planchettes (red and blue colored discs incorporated into the paper, sim ilar to threads) to trigger scanning equipment which would detect its presence, and to s ort cash faster. A consumer research firm from Illinois was hired by the Treasu ry Department to gauge the public’s reactions to the various designs. It was shown that a drastic change would not be acc epted, so a process of incrementalism was adopted. It was decided that the Bureau of Printing and Engraving would have a fine metallic strip running through th e currency, leaving the basic design intact; however, they later decided to use a clear imprinted polyester strip, woven into the paper, running vertically on the left side of t he Federal Reserve Seal. The length of the translucent polyester filament reads “USA100” f or $100 bills, “USA50” for $50 bills, and so on; and can only be read if held up to direc t light. It was reported that a company called Checkmate Electronics, Inc., which manufactu res the equipment needed to scan checks, scanned the new money, and found the strip to contain “machine detectable” aluminum. Their scan produced an indecipherable bar code. Though the basic design did not change, there was m icroscopic type printed around the picture which reads, “The United States of Amer ica,” but appeared to only be a line. This currency with oversized, off)center portraits, was introduced in 1996 with the $100 bills, then $50 bills and $20 bills (1998), and cul minated with $10’s and $5’s in 2000. The Government discontinued printing any of the old money, and began emptying their vaults to get rid of the old bills. The old money w as never recalled, and continued to be circulated. Then in June, 2002, only a few years after the last makeover, the rumors of colored money became a fact, as the Bureau of Engraving and Printing announced that further changes were being made to our money for security r easons. In October, 2003, the new, colored $20 bill (the most counterfeited note) , was introduced. The new bill retained the security thread, color)shifting ink, a nd watermark; but also had the colors of green and peach added to its background, as well as small yellow “20’s” printed on the back. The new $50 and $100 bills will be coming in 2004 and 2005. "},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":" The new Twenty Dollar Bill Some financial experts have theorized that when eve ry denomination is changed over, that the business sector may not want to acce pt old bills, which would then become worthless, and could create a financial emer gency. But Federal officials have said that the old money would be accepted, but scru tinized. It has been suggested that the government could really take advantage of the s ituation, that in order for people to exchange their old money for new, an exchange rate may be determined which would benefit the economy. For example, it may take two o ld dollars to exchange for a new one. It is possible that we may be experiencing the final transition to the “new money.” This transitional currency may be just another step in testing the public’s willingness to accept economic change. The Reserve formally had about seven currency sorting machines which counted up to 55,000 bills per minut e, but by the end of 1983, they had received 110 new machines which could count up to 7 2,000 bills per minute. Jane Kettleson, an economic consultant to the U.S. Paper Exchange, said that, “the FED will have the capability to physically replace the entir e U.S. currency in circulation in just four days time.” The International Monetary Fund has been responsibl e for the decline of our dollar, and our present economic situation. The first step to initiating this ‘crash’ was the Monetary Control Act of 1980, which instead of a 6: 1 ratio, mandated the Federal Reserve to only have one dollar on deposit for ever y twelve they create. Further plans were made during a meeting of Western leaders at Wi lliamsburg, Virginia, on May 28) 30, 1983. International cooperation has been intense to coord inate currency changes among its member governments. In 1985, officials from the Morgan Bank in New York met with the Credit Lyonnais Bank in France. They establishe d the European Currency Unit Banking Association (ECUBA), to get world cooperati on for a unified currency, and had support from bankers in Europe, Japan, and the Unit ed States. It was an offshoot of the Banking Federation of the European Community (BFEC) , which has been engaged in shutting down small banks in order to develop a con glomerate of a few huge banks. In October, 1987, the Association for the Monetary Uni on of Europe (AMUE), secretly met and recommended that the ECU (European Currency Uni t) replace existing national"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"currencies; and that all European Central Banks be combined into one and issue the ECU as the official unified currency (which is sche duled to occur in the year 2000). It is believed that the plan is to have only three centra l banks in the world: The Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank, and the Ce ntral Bank of Japan. In a June, 1989 hearing of the Senate Banking Securities Subco mmittee, Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve, said that exchange rates could be fixed in order to solve the problem of uniformity between the currenc ies of various nations. Many countries have issued new money, such as Switz erland, the United Kingdom, Japan, Canada, France, Germany, Australia, and Braz il. Of the countries that already had, most currencies had a common 1” square, usuall y on the left side of the bill. Held over a light, a hologram appears on the spot, barel y visible to the naked eye, which cannot be reproduced on a copier. It is believed th at this spot is being reserved for a central World Bank overprint. They also contain met allic strips that can be detected when they pass through scanners at airports and int ernational borders. On May 10, 1994, when USA Today carried a page one article concerning major changes in the design of the paper currency, which was expected to take place by the end of the year, it was accompanied with a picture of the new $100 bill, featuring a larger portrait of Benjamin Franklin which had been pushed to the right side of the bill, and the Eagle in the center. The line “United State s of America” appeared along the top right, and the line “One Hundred Dollars” appeared on the lower left, with the serial number being placed over that. There was a conspicu ous open spot on the left side of the bill, very similar to the new currency in other countries, which some researchers feared was being reserved for some future use. The institution of a common world)wide currency may be delayed because of the possibility of moving right to a cashless system, m aking paper money obsolete. The Visa MagiCard was the first step towards a national debit card. With this card, you could make purchases at any of the 10 million merchants w ho accepted Visa, and have the amount electronically deducted from your checking a ccount. Financial experts said at the time, that within only a few years, there would be more debit cards than credit cards. Since then, there has been a massive campaign to pr omote debit cards, and a move to accommodate their use in all areas of life. More and more banks have decided not to return peop le’s cancelled checks, because of the expense to do so; and it seems likel y that there is a plan underway to gradually move away from the use of paper checks. W ith the existence of debit cards, and the fact that credit cards are so easily attain able, there’s no doubt that we’re being pushed into an electronic economy of Direct Deposit and Automatic Withdrawal. When total saturation has been achieved, then the stage will be set. Sure, it’s really convenient to whip out a piece of plastic to buy th ings, and to have all your financial affairs handled through the bank’s computer system. But do you realize, that when their plan is complete, you will be nothing more than a n umber in a computer. Everything you do can be tracked; and with a click of a mouse, or the press of a button, you could be denied access to your own money. In a letter to Edward M. House (President Wilson’s closest aide), dated November 23, 1933, Franklin D. Roosevelt said: “The real tru th of the matter is, and you and I know, that a financial element in the large centers has owned the government of the U.S. since the days of Andrew Jackson.” Henry Ford, founder of the Ford Motor"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"Company, said: “It is well enough that the people o f the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system, for if they did, I bel ieve there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning.” In 1957, Sen. George W. M alone of Nevada said before Congress about the Federal Reserve: “I believe that if the people of this nation fully understood what Congress has done to them over the past 49 years, they would move on Washington: they would not wait for an election ... It adds up to a preconceived plan to destroy the economic and social independence of the United States.” THE FEDERAL INCOME TAX With the I Iluminati in complete control of our monetary syste m, they were ready for the next step. They couldn’t touch the money of the people, because the Constitution did not contain any provision for the taxing of inc ome; so they now set into motion a plan to accomplish this, in order to oppress the mi ddle class, and increase the lower class, who would have to depend on the government f or their survival. From 1862)72, to support the Civil War effort, Cong ress enacted the nation’s first income tax: 3% on incomes from $600 to $10,000, and 5% for incomes above that, which was later deemed to be insufficient, and it w as increased twice, till it reached a high of 10% on all incomes over $5,000. The tax was criticized because it wasn’t apportioned among the states according to populatio n. The Act of 1862 also provided for a sales tax, excise tax, and inheritance tax; a nd established the office of Commissioner of Internal Revenue, who was given the power to assess, levy, and collect taxes, and was given the authority to enfor ce tax laws. In 1868, tobacco and alcoholic beverages were taxed. The income tax was discontinued in 1872, but after heavy lobbying by the Populist Party, it was reinstated in 1894, as part of the Wi lson)German Tariff Bill, when Congress enacted a 2% tax on all incomes over $4,000 a year. On May 20, 1895, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the tax was unconstitution al, because it was not distributed among the states in accordance with the Constitutio n. Newspapers controlled by the I Iluminati denounced the Court’s decision. When the income tax legislation was introduced in t he Senate in 1894, Sen. Aldrich had come out against it, saying it was “communistic and socialistic,” but in 1909, he proposed the 16th Amendment to the Constitution, wi th the support of President Taft, which called for the creation of a progressive grad uated income tax. It was ratified in February, 1913, and levied a 1% tax on all incomes over $3,000, and a progressive surtax on incomes over $20,000. Although praised by reformers, conservatives said it was “a first step toward complete confiscation of p rivate property.” "},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"   Sen. Nelso n Aldrich  Philander C. Kno x According to a 2)volume investigative report called The Law That Never Was , by William J. Benson (who had been a special agent wit h the Illinois Department of Revenue for 10 years) and M. J. Beckman, on Februar y 25, 1913, shortly before the end of his term, Secretary of State Philander C. Kn ox ignored various irregularities, and fraudulently declared that the 16th Amendment had b een ratified by three)fourths (or 36) of the 48 states. Benson traveled to all the st ates’ archives, and to the National Archives in Washington, DC, obtaining more than 17, 000 pages of documents, all properly notarized and certified by state officials , that proved that the 16th Amendment was never ratified. A 16)page memo dated February 15, 1913, to Knox, fr om his solicitor, stated that only four states had “correctly” ratified the amend ment, that Minnesota had not forwarded their copy yet, and that the resolutions from 33 states contained punctuation, capitalization, or wording different than the Resol ution that was approved by Congress. The memo read: “In the certified copies of the resolutions passed by the legislatures of the several states ratifying the proposed 16th amendment, it ap pears that only four of these resolutions (those submitted by Arizona, North Dako ta, Tennessee and New Mexico) have quoted absolutely accurately and corre ctly the 16th amendment as proposed by Congress. The other thirty)three resolu tions all contain errors either of punctuation, capitalization, or wording. Minneso ta, it is to be remembered, did not transmit to the Department a copy of the resolution passed by the legislature of the state. The resolutions passed by twenty)two states contain errors only of capitalization or punctuation, or both, while those of eleven states contain errors in the wording...” Benson discovered that some word changes and mispla ced commas were done by legislative intent. State Legislatures voting to ra tify a proposed Constitutional amendment, must use a certified, exact copy, as pas sed by the Congress. Since this was not done, legally, the Government can only coll ect an income tax within the guidelines set forth by the Supreme Court in Polloc k v. Farmers Loan & Trust Co., 157 U.S. 429 (1895), and all sections of the Internal Revenue Code, base d on the 16th"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"Amendment, are not valid. So, of the 48 states: Eight states (Rhode Island, Utah, Connecticut, New Hampshire, Kentucky, Florida, Virginia, and Pennsylvania) did not approv e or ratify the amendment.

Vermont and Massachusetts rejected the amendment wi th a recorded vote count, but later declared it passed without a recor ded vote only after the amendment had been declared ratified by Knox. Tennessee, Ohio, Mississippi, California, and Washi ngton violated their own state constitutions during their ratification proce dures. Minnesota had not sent any copy of its resolution t o Knox, let alone a signed and sealed copy, as was required by law. Oklahoma, Georgia, and Illinois had made unacceptab le changes in the wording, as did some of the above states (in addition to the other unacceptable procedures). When you deduct these 21 states, you only had a pro per ratification by only 27 states, far less than the Constitutionally)mandated 36. Because of his diligence, Benson was arrested and i mprisoned on income tax charges, but later released. Why the Federal Government Doesn’t Have Jurisdictio n Over States According to Article I, Section 8 of the Constituti on of the United States: “The Congress shall have power ... to exclusive legislat ion in all cases whatsoever, over such district (not exceeding ten miles square) as may, b y cession of particular States and the acceptance of Congress, become the seat of the Gove rnment of the United States, and to exercise like authority over all places purchase d by the consent of the legislature of the State in which the same shall be, for the erect ion of forts, magazines, arsenals, dockyards, and other needful building...” This passage reveals the true intention of our fore fathers, which was for the Federal Government to coordinate the efforts of all the Sta tes in order to combine their resources when it came to things like trade and def ense, since the States were actually like separate countries. Therefore, the Congress on ly had jurisdiction over the area of Washington, D.C., and non)state territories like Al aska, and Hawaii (before they became states); and the present countries of Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and others; and Federal property such as mil itary bases. This area will be hereinafter referred to as the District (as in the District of Columbia), as it is in the United"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"States Code (see 26 USC 7701(a) (1), and 26 USC 312 1(e) (1) ). Since America is a Republic, and not a democracy, t he Government has a responsibility to protect the inalienable rights of its citizens, as granted by the Constitution, rather than to grant privileges, know n as civil rights, which are decided by the will of the majority. When the sovereign state citizen gave power to the State Constitution, which created State Government; this in turn gave power to the U.S. Constitution, which created the Federal Government; which has, in a sense, incorporated and gave power to the United States Go vernment; which has turned the U.S. citizen into a subject of the U.S. Government. Therefore, the Federal Government has been able to wield its influence over the entir e country, rather than just the area referred to as the District. This is possible, because, for all intents and purp oses, there are two of every state. For example, the official name of Pennsylvania is t he Commonwealth of Pennsylvania; but to the U.S. Government, it is known as the Stat e of Pennsylvania. There are even two state flags. One with a gold fringe, which repr esents the State of Pennsylvania, and martial law under the U.S. Government; and one with out the fringe, which represents the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The gold)fringed flag was reserved for use by the General of the Army, where it was present at milita ry headquarters and displayed at court martials. Its use elsewhere, as a government battle flag, was only to be done at the discretion of the President, within his role as the Commander)in)Chief of the military, to establish the jurisdiction of the military prese nce. This gold)fringed flag, which is common in many public places, such as courthouses, and schools, is not the national flag which represents our constitutional republic. It is a symbol of federal government jurisdiction. Gold)fringed flag When Franklin D. Roosevelt was inaugurated on March 4, 1933, he called for an emergency session of Congress on March 9th, where t he Emergency Banking Relief Act (also known as the War Powers Act, which seized all the country’s constitutional"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"gold and silver coinage) was passed, which gave FDR the power to issue any order, and do anything he felt was necessary to run the co untry, without restriction, by authority of the Trading with the Enemy Act of Octo ber 6, 1917 (which placed all German citizens under the authority of the Presiden t, because they were enemies of the U.S.). In 1917, Chapter 106, Section 2, subdivision (c), o f the Trading with the Enemy Act, defined the Enemy as someone “other than citizens o f the United StatesC” and in 1933, according to Chapter 106, Section 5, subdivision (b ), the Act designated as the Enemy “any person within the United States.” Franklin D. Roosevelt America was under the authority of an emergency war government. According to the book Constitution: Fact or Fiction by Dr. Eugene Schroder (with Micki Nellis), our Constitution was actually nullified on March 9, 193 3, when President Franklin Roosevelt declared a national emergency. As recorded in Congressional Record in 1933, Rep. James Buck said: “...the doctrine of emergency is t he worst. It means that when Congress declares an emergency, there is no Constit ution. This means it’s dead.” Senate Report 93)549 (Senate Resolution 9, 93rd Con gress, 1st Session) in 1973 said that since 1933 “the United States has been in a st ate of declared national emergency C A majority of the people of the United States hav e lived all their lives under emergency rule. For 40 years freedoms and governmen tal procedures guaranteed by the Constitution have, in varying degrees, been abr idged by laws brought into force by states of national emergency...” The Act was never repealed after the World War II, because Roosevelt died; and Truman used the extraor dinary powers he gained through the rewriting of the War Powers Act to establish th e National Security infrastructure, which included the C.I.A. The “national emergency” technically ended on Septe mber 14, 1976, when the 93rd Congress passed H.R. 3884, the National Emergencies Termination Act (50 USC 1601, Public Law 94)412) in response to President Richard Nixon’s abuse of the Trading with the Enemy Act (which was part of Roosevelt’s emerge ncy legislation). Though he had promised an end to the U.S. involvement in the Viet nam War, he actually escalated the war by authorizing the secret bombing of Cambodia. And then later, in December, 1972, Nixon ordered American B)52’s to drop over 36,000 t ons of bombs over Haiphong and Hanoi. Congress then appointed the Special Committe e on the Termination of the"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"National Emergency, headed by Sen. Frank Church (D) ID), who began having hearings in July, 1973. Even though it appeared that the eme rgency legislation was repealed, the last paragraph said that it didn’t apply to any “au thorities under the act of October 6, 1917, as amended.” Richard M. Nixon Chuck Morse wrote in his article “Is the ‘National Emergency of FDR’ Still In Place?” that: “This was a classic example of sleight of han d. In fact, Congress exempted all laws, based on the emergency of 1933 that were alre ady in place. Rather than being based on the authority of the President under a ‘na tional emergency’ these federal laws would now be codified as a permanent part of the U. S. Federal Code. Included among the codified laws would be Section 5(b) of the Trad ing with the Enemy Act, which classifies the American citizen as an enemy of the government.” The declaration of a National Emergency can legally empower the President to suspend the Constitution. According to Senate Repor t 93)549, the “President may: Seize property, organize commodities, assign milita ry forces abroad, institute Martial Law, seize and control transportation and communica tion, regulate operation of private enterprise, restrict travel, and in a plethora of p articular ways, control the lives of all American citizens.” President Carter declared a new national emergency in 1979 during the Iranian hostage crisis, and Bill Clinton, during his two te rms in office, declared 12 National Emergencies.

However, because of Executive Orders 6073, 6102 (go ld confiscation), 6111, 6260 and 6262 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, it is believed that the District went bankrupt in 1933, and since then, has undergone var ious “reorganizations.” The Secretary of Treasury was appointed “receiver” in t he bankruptcy (Reorganization Plan, No. 26, 5 U.S.C.A. 903; Public Law 94)564; Legislat ive History, pg. 5967). Representative James A. Traficant, Jr. of Ohio, acc ording to the Congressional Record (pg. H1303), on March 17, 1993, said: “Mr. Speaker, we are now in Chapter 11. Members of Congress are official Trustees presiding over the greatest reorganization of any bankrupt entity in world history, the United St ates governmentC” James A. Traficant, Jr. It was in 1933 that FDR enacted the Social Security Act, which effectively redefined the word “employee” to indicate “government worker. ” Then came the Public Salary Tax Act in 1939, which gave the U.S. Government the pow er to levy a tax on those people who were either government employees, or who lived and worked in a “Federal Area.” A year later, the Buck Act was passed, which gave the U.S. Government the power to create a “Federal Area” so they could levy the Publ ic Salary Tax. Since it was"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"unconstitutional to tax anyone outside of the juris diction of the District, this Act, in Section 110(d) and (e), made the land within the te rritorial boundaries of a State, a “Federal Area.” This, in effect, created a paper st ate, known as a Federal Area, for the purposes of the U.S. Government; and those people w ho were sovereign state citizens, now found themselves also living in this Federal Ar ea. Now the U.S. Government had to make that citizen one of their subjects by bringing them under the jurisdiction of the District. This was accomplished by deceiving the citizen into entering an adhesion contract with the U.S. Government, such as a Social Security application, an Income Tax form, a Driver’s License application, a Bank Account applic ation, and other similar things. Contrary to what most people believe, it is not man datory to apply for a Social Security number; however, in order for a sovereign state cit izen to be eligible for Social Security benefits, they have to waive the rights given to th em under our Republic. Probably, the most incredible example of the adhesi on contract is the Income Tax system. In 1884, it was accepted that the “property which every man has is his own labor (and) as it is the original foundation of all other property, so it is the most sacred and inviolable.” Therefore, since ‘wages’ are recei ved as compensation for labor, it can not be legally taxed. ‘Income,’ however, is the pro cess of profiting from a business (someone else’s labor) or investments, and is taxab le, as in a Corporation, which is an artificial entity which is given the right to exist by the State. The Constitution only allows the Congress to collect taxes, and that is limited to a uniform excise tax on gasoline, alcohol, tobacco, telephone bills, firearms, and ti res, things revolving in one way or another around interstate commerce. The payment of these taxes are voluntary, because they are based on consumption. These funds go directly to the U.S. Treasury to pay the expenses of the country. Because we live in a Republic, the Internal Revenue Service Code, Title 26 USC, could not be passed into law by the Congress, and i nstead, was passed only as a Resolution, which is a formal expression of intent that was to pertain only to citizens of the District. So, how do they make you a citizen of the District? In the upper left)hand corner of the 1040 Federal Income Tax form is a pla ce to put your preprinted address label, which is designated with the words “label he re.” However, to the left of that is the word “label,” which seemingly identifies the entire section as a whole. However, the word “label” actually has another legal meaning tha t has nothing to do with your name and address. According to Black’s Law Dictionary , “label” is defined as: “A slip of ribbon, parchment, or paper, attached as a codicil to a dee d or other writing to hold the appended seal.” Since your “seal” is your signature , the “label” is actually a codicil which indicates you are waiving your constitutional right as a sovereign state citizen to become a citizen of the District and its Federal Ar ea.

Chief Justice John Marshall said: “The power to tax involves the power to destroy.” Alan Keyes, the former ambassador to the UN, who ra n for President in 2000 said: “We ought to have realized that the income tax is u tterly incompatible with liberty. It is actually a form of slavery. A slave is someon e the fruit of whose labor is controlled by somebody else. A slave is not somebod y with nothing.

In July, 1943, workers in this country were subject to a payroll w ithholding tax in the form of a “victory tax” that was touted as a temporary tax to boost th e economy because of the War, and would later be discontinued. However, the deduction remained because it forced compliance. FOUNDATIONS Under the guise of philanthropy, the I Iluminati avoided taxation by transferring their wealth to tax)free foundations. Benjamin Franklin Foundations are either state or federally chartered . The first was chartered by Benjamin Franklin in 1790, in Philadelphia and Bost on, from a $4,444.49 fund, to make loans “to young married artificers (artisans) of go od character.” In 1800, the Magdalen Society was established in Philadelphia, “to amelio rate that distressed condition of those unhappy females who have been seduced from th e paths of virtue, and are desirous of returning to a life of rectitude.” In 1 846, the Smithsonian Institution was established by the bequest of English scientist Jam es Smithson “for the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men.” The Peabody Educ ation Fund was initiated in 1867 by banker George Peabody, to promote education in t he South. Before 1900, there were only 18 foundations; from 1 910)19, there were 76; during the 1920’s, 173; the 1930’s, 288; the 1940’s, 1,638 ; and during the 1950’s, there were 2,839 foundations. United Press International (UPI) reported on July 1 9, 1969, that the top 596 foundations had an income that was twice the net ea rnings of the country’s 50 largest commercial banking institutions. According to Rep. Wright Patman, in a report to the 87th Congress, it is because of the existence of foundations, that “only one)third of the income of the nation is actually taxed.” Some of the important foundations are: Ford Foundat ion (Ford Motor Co.),"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"Rockefeller Foundation (Standard Oil), Duke Endowme nt (Duke family fortune), John A.

Moody’s oil, realt y, newspapers, and bank holdings), Lilly Endowment (Eli Lilly Pharmaceuticals), Pew Me morial Trust (Sun Oil Co. or Sunoco), and the Danforth Foundation (Purina Cereal s), which all have assets of well over $100 million. The first Congressional Committee to investigate th e tax)free foundations was the Cox Committee in 1952, led by Rep. Eugene E. Cox, a Democrat from Georgia. Its purpose was to find out which “foundations and orga nizations are using their resources for purposes other than the purposes for which they were established, and especially to determine which such foundations and organizations are using their resources for un) American and subversive activities or for purposes not in the interest or tradition of the United States.” Cox discovered that officers and trustees of some f oundations were Communists, and that these foundations had given grants to Comm unists or Communist)controlled organizations. A former Communist official, Maurice Malkin, testified that in 1919 they were trying “to penetrate these organizations (foun dations), if necessary take control of them and their treasuries ... that they should be a ble to finance the Communist Party propaganda in the United States.” During the invest igation, Cox died, and the facts were glossed over in a cover)up. Another member of the Committee, Rep. Carroll Reece of Tennessee, the former Chairman of the Republican National Committee, forc ed another investigation in 1953, to see if foundations were being used “for politica l purposes, propaganda, or attempts to influence legislation.” The Washington Post called the investigation “unnecessary,” and that it was “stupidly wasteful of public funds.” Re ece even referred to a “conspiracy.” The Eisenhower Administration was clearly against t he probe. Three of the four who were selected for the Committee, with Reece, were H ouse members who had voted against the investigation. Rep. Wayne Hays of Ohio worked from the inside to stall the investigation. During one 3)hour session, he interr upted the same witness 246 times. He prohibited evidence discovered by two of its inv estigators from being used. Rene A. Wormser, legal counsel to the Committee, revealed w hy, in his 1958 book Foundations: Their Power and Influence : “Mr. Hays told us one day that ‘the White House’ had been in touch with him and asked him if he would coopera te to kill the Committee.” Wormser also revealed that the Committee had discovered tha t these foundations were using their wealth to attack the basic structure of our C onstitution and Judeo)Christian ethics; and that the influence of major foundations had “re ached far into government, into the policy)making circles of Congress and into the Stat e Department.”"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":" Rene Wormser’s book Reece’s Special Committee to Investigate Tax Exempt Foundations discovered that many foundations were financing civil rights groups , liberal political groups, political extremist groups, and supporting revolutionary acti vities throughout the world. The Committee reported: “Substantial evidence indicates there is more than a mere close working together among some foundations operating in the in ternational field. There is here, as in the general realm of social sciences, a close interlock. The Carnegie Corporation, the Carnegie Endowment for Internation al Peace, the Rockefeller Foundation and, recently, the Ford Foundation, join ed by some others, have commonly cross)financed, to a tune of many millions ... organizations concerned with internationalists, among them, the Institute o f Pacific Relations, the Foreign Policy Association (which was “virtually a creature of the Carnegie Endowment”), the Council on Foreign Relations, the Royal Institu te of International Affairs and others ... and that it happened by sheer coincidenc e stretches credulity.” On August 19, 1954, Reece summed up his investigati on: “It has been said that the foundations are a power second only to that of the Federal Government itself ... Perhaps the Congress should now admit that the foun dations have become more powerful, in some areas, at least, than the legisla tive branch of the Government.” The investigation ended in 1955, when funding was withh eld.

In 1870, when Standard O il of Ohio was incorporated, Rockefeller controlled 21 out of 26 refineries in C leveland. By 1871, Standard Oil was the largest refining company in the world. In 1879, he controlled over 90% of all refined oil sold in the country, with 20,000 producing well s, and 100,000 employees.

In 1888, details concerning the Rockefeller Oil Tru st began to leak out in the newspapers. In Ohio, at the time, a company within the state could not own stock in a company in another state, which occurred when Rocke feller bought out smaller companies. Using the secret Trust, which was establ ished in 1879, the trustees for the companies that had been taken over, the 37 Standard Oil stockholders, and Standard Oil of Ohio, relayed all out)of)state subsidiary st ock to three clerks from Standard Oil. In 1882, the three “dummy” trustees, 42 Standard Oil s tockholders, and Standard Oil of Ohio, transferred all its stock to nine trustees, w ho were controlled by Rockefeller. In March, 1892, the Ohio Supreme Court ordered Standar d Oil to withdraw from the Trust, after Ohio and other states outlawed trusts. Rockef eller countered by moving Standard Oil to New Jersey, who allowed their corporations t o hold stock in out)of)state companies, thus, Standard Oil of New Jersey became that holding Company. In 1889, Rockefeller helped establish, with a grant of $600,000, the University of Chicago. He promised to support the school for ten years, which he did, donating $34,708,375. In 1901, he incorporated the Rockefell er Institute for Medical Research (now Rockefeller University), with a grant of $200, 000. In 1903, he established the Rockefeller General Education Board, which he donat ed $42 million to, within a two) year period (and $129 million in total). The Board was organized by Fred Gates, the front man for the Pillsbury flour company. In 1909, the Rockefeller Sanitation Commission was established, to which he gave $1 mil lion. Rockefeller’s goal was for Standard Oil to be the w orld’s only refining company, and to that end, it was alleged that he blew up a compe titor’s refinery in Buffalo, New York. He owned large blocks of stock in quite a few newsp apers, including the Buffalo People’s Journal , the Oil City Derrick (in Pennsylvania), the Cleveland Herald , and the Cleveland News Leader .

This partnership built a $50 million alumi num production center in Russia, and announced a multi)million plan for Russia and other Eastern European countries, which included the building of large hotels in Bucharest, Sofia, Budapest, Belgrade, Prague, and Warsaw; rubber plants, and a glass plant in Rom ania. In addition, Tower International made an agreement with the Soviet pat ent and licensing organization, Licensintorg, to promote Soviet)American trade, whi ch up to that time, was done by Amtorg Trading Corp., the official Soviet agency in America. This gave the Rockefellers and Eatons complete control over what technology wa s sent to Russia.

Through interlocking directorates, the Foundation c ontrols the Carnegie Endowment, and the Ford Foundation. While the Carnegie Endowme nt deals with education, as it relates to international matters; the Rockefeller F oundation concentrates on education, as it relates to domestic issues.

The Carnegie Endowment Andrew Carnegie (1835)1919) came to the United Stat es as a poor immigrant from Scotland in 1848, and never became an American citi zen. He built the Carnegie Steel Corporation, which he sold to J. P. Morgan for $500 million, who incorporated the company into the United States Steel Corporation in 1901, enabling Carnegie to retire and concentrate on his philanthropic activities. "},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"   Andrew Ca rnegie  William Torrey Harris In 1889, William Torrey Harris, the U.S. Commission er of Education, told a high) ranking railroad official that the schools were bei ng scientifically designed not to overeducate children. He believed that the schools should alienate children from their parents and religion. In 1890, Carnegie wrote eleve n essays which were published under the title The Gospel of Wealth . The underlying premise was that the free) enterprise system had been locked)up by men such as himself, J.P. Morgan, and John D. Rockefeller, and that they not only owned everyt hing, but also controlled the government. His worry, was that subsequent generati ons would realize this, and work against them. His solution was to control the educa tion system, and to create a direct relationship between the amount of education a pers on had, and how good of a job they could get. Therefore, this created a motivation for children to attend school, where they would be taught only what the social engineers of t his country wanted them to know. This was to be accomplished by instituting the educ ational system developed by Prussia between 1808 and 1819. German Philosopher J ohann Gottlieb Fichte (1762) 1814) in his “Addresses to the German Nation” (1807 )08) said that he did not trust parental influence and preferred education to be ca rried out in a “separate and independent” environment controlled by the state. P russia became the first government to have compulsory education, setting up a three)ti ered system. The children of the elite, about one)half of one percent, went to schoo ls called academies, and were taught to think and be independent. About 5)1/2% went to R ealschulen, where they were partially taught how to think. The other 94% went t o Volkschulen, where the idea of being a follower and a good citizen was stressed.

Mor gan, and Rockefeller; major universities like Columbia, Johns Hopkins, the Univ ersity of Wisconsin, the University of Michigan, and the University of Chicago; and large foundations like Carnegie, Rockefeller, Ford, Mellon, Peabody, Sage, and Whitn ey. The success in creating an organized compulsory educational system in this cou ntry has allowed the elite of this country to prevent each generation from truly under standing how this country is actually run, thus keeping them from doing anything about it . This ‘dumbing)down’ has enabled the government to more easily assimilate the people of this country into a population which can be easily deceived and controlled. John Dewey John Dewey, known as the “Father of American Educat ion,” was a Socialist, and a founding member of the Intercollegiate Socialist So ciety (who changed their name to League for Industrial Democracy, which he became th e President of), and one of the 34 signers of the Humanist Manifesto in 1933. In his My Pedagogic Creed (1897) and The School and Society (1899), he expressed his belief at how the schools should be instrumental in developing a socialist society in A merica.” His system of ‘progressive"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"education’ would deemphasize academics, and use psy chology to do that. The July, 1908 Hibbert Journal quoted him as saying: “Our schools C are performin g an infinite significant religious work. They are promoting the social unity out of which in the end genuine religious unity must grow.” With a grant of $27,000,000, Carnegie established t he Carnegie Institute of Technology in Pittsburgh, in 1900, which became the Carnegie)Mellon University in 1967, when it merged with the Mellon Institute, whi ch had been founded in 1913. In 1905, he established the Carnegie Foundation for th e Advancement of Teaching, which, within a 20 year period, gave over $20 million to r etiring teachers (and widows) at universities and technical schools in the United St ates and Canada to support the profession and encourage higher education. In 1904, in the U.S., and 1908 in the United Kingdom, he set up the Carnegie Hero Fund to reward heroic deeds by civilian citizens, and gave out close to $500,000,000. He also establi shed the world renowned Carnegie Hall, and over 2,000 public libraries. He was also a major supporter of the Tuskogee Institute in Alabama, which was founded by Booker T . Washington.

Dodd said they wanted “to bring the idea of ‘one) world’ (government) to the point where it is accept able to the people of this country. That is the primary aim, and everything that has ha ppened since then is a means to that one end.” Their memos indicated that they believed their efforts were successful, because the war “had brought about a change in the American psyche.” In the archives of the Endowment, Dodd discovered t hat they felt that the “only way to maintain control of the population was to obtain control of education in the U.S. They realized this was a prodigious task so they approac hed the Rockefeller Foundation with the suggestion that they go in tandem and that port ion of education which could be considered as domestically oriented be taken over b y the Rockefeller Foundation and that portion which was oriented to international ma tters be taken over by the Carnegie Endowment.” Dodd said that “they decided that the s uccess of this program lay in an alteration in the matter in which American history was to be presented.” The Guggenheim Foundation agreed to award fellowshi ps to historians recommended by the Carnegie Endowment, and a group of 20 were assembled, and sent to London, where they were briefed and became founding members of the American History Association.

THE STOCK MARKET CRASH AND DEPRESSION The Federal Reserve Board held a secret meeting on May 18, 1920, to plan a depression. Large banks began calling in loans, cau sing stocks to drop from a high of 138.12 in 1919, to a low of 66.24 in 1921. When the value of government bonds plummeted, they were forced to call in even more lo ans. When thousands of the banks’ customers could not pay their notes, the banks seiz ed their assets. After 1922, profits rose, and with the Federal Rese rve’s ability to lend ten times more than their reserves, credit was easily obtained. Fr om 1923 to 1929, $8 billion was sliced off of the deficit. The Reserve expanded the money supply by 62%, and this excess money was used to bid the stock market up to fantas tic heights. The media began publicizing that there was an enormous profit to be made from the stock market. This push was planned at a meeting of the International Bankers in 1926, who made the boom possible, and who was going to bring about fin ancial disaster later. In 1928, the House hearings on the Stabilization of the Purchasing Power of the Dollar, revealed that the Federal Reserve Board had met with the heads of various European central banks at a secret luncheon in 1927 to plan what they believed may be a major crash. On February 6, 1929, after Montagu N orman, Chairman of the Bank of England, came to the United States to meet with And rew Mellon, the Secretary of Treasury, the Reserve reversed its monetary policy by raising the discount rate, and during the next few months, after Paul Warburg had issued a tip in March, 1929, I Iluminati members, who knew what the future held, g ot their money out of the stock market, reinvesting it in gold and silver.

To prolong the depres sion after the crash, from 1929 to 1933, the Reserve began to reduce the money flow by one)third. The Great Depression, as it became known, was engin eered by the I Iluminati to take money from the people, and to make them depend ent on the Government through the subsequent New Deal programs of Roosevelt. Cong ressman Louis T. McFadden, Chairman of the House Banking and Currency Committe e said: “It was no accident. It was a carefully contrived occurrence ...

George Washin gton  Woodrow Wilson The armistice ending World War I on November 11, 19 18, was negotiated on the basis of Wilson’s “Fourteen Points” and on June 28, 1919, was included in the Treaty of Versailles, a 20)year truce which divided up Europe , setting the stage for World War II. It demanded that Germany pay war reparations to the victorious countries. The Allies maintained that “since Germany was responsible for the War she was liable for the costs and damages incurred by the victors.” This am ount was set at $32 billion, plus interest; which called for annual payments of $500 million, plus a 26% surcharge on exports. The agreement forced Germany to forfeit so me of her prime provinces, colonies, and natural resources. They signed away t heir rights, had to make trade concessions, and lost what property they had in tho se foreign countries. The Treaty was widely criticized. David Lloyd Georg e, the Prime Minister of England, said: “We have written a document that guarantees w ar in 20 years ... When you place conditions on a people (Germany) that it cannot pos sibly keep, you force it to either breech the agreement or to war. Either we modify th at agreement, and make it tolerable to the German people, or when the new generation co mes along they will try again.” Lord Curzon, the British Foreign Secretary, said: “ This is no peace, this is only a truce for twenty years!” Even President Wilson was report ed to have said: “If I were a German, I think I should never sign it.” "},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"  David Lloyd Geor ge  Lord Curzon The League of Nations was signed and sealed at the Paris Peace Conference.

The final version, approved and adopted by an act of Congress on June 20, 1782, was the result of a series of committee meetings which combined ideas from Barton , Thompson and Jefferson, who placed a triangle around the eye, added the year ‘1 776,’ ‘E Pluribus Unum,’ the olive branch on the front, stars above the eagle, and oth er things.

In 1947, they united with the Civil Rights Congress, a communist front group. In a 1928 pamphlet by John Pepper (alias for Joseph Pogany) called American Negro Problems , a move was being made by Stalin to ferment revolu tion and stir the Blacks into creating a separate Republic for the Ne gro. Another pamphlet put out by the New York Communist Party in 1935, called The Negroes in a Soviet America , urged the Blacks to rise up and form a Soviet State in the So uth by applying for admission to the Comintern. It contained a firm pledge that a revolt would be supported by all American communists and liberals. On page 48, it said that t he Soviet Government would give the Blacks more benefits than they would give to the Wh ites, and “any act of discrimination or prejudice against the Negro would become a crime under the revolutionary law.” In The Communist Party: A Manual On Organization by J.

The Communist Party, as the revolutionary party of the proletaria t, is the only party which is courageously and resolutely carrying on a struggle against the double exploitation and national oppression of the Negro p eople, becoming intense with the developing crisis, can win over the great masse s of the Negro people as allies of the Proletariat against the American bour geosie.” In James Cannon’s America’s Road to Socialism , he says that the Negroes “will play a great and decisive role in the revolution ...

You can bet your boo ts the Negro will join the Revolution to fight for that– once it becomes clear to them th at it cannot be gained except by revolution.” The former FBI Director, J.

It was to create more tension between Blacks and Whites. Incidentally, it was the Warren Court who prohibite d prayer and the singing of Christmas carols in the schools. This was intended to weaken Christianity. Jacob Schiff, the Rothschild’s man in America, deci ded that the best way to create racial tension was to establish leadership among th e Blacks. In 1909, he laid out plans for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). It was the merging of the communist)controlled Niagara Mov ement, a group of Blacks led by W. E.

He was taking directions from Communists. I know for a fact the Communists would never have promoted him, financed him, and supported him if they couldn’t trust him.

THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE Another contributing factor to Wilson’s election to the Presidency, and how the I Iluminati controls the American electorate today, i s accomplished through a process known as the Electoral College. Woodrow Wilson Because delegates to the Constitutional Convention, which met in Philadelphia in 1787, thought that the general public lacked the in sight and the judgment necessary to elect a President, and could be easily misled by ir responsible candidates, they enacted the Electoral College to do the job. The President and Vice)President are the only publi c officials in the country who are not elected through a direct vote of the people. Ea ch party, in every state, has a slate of electoral candidates, based on the number of repres entatives it has in Congress. They are known as the Electoral College. Presently, ther e are 100 Senators and 435 Representatives in the United States, for a total o f 538 (includes 3 votes from the District of Columbia) electoral votes. "},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":" The electors of the Party receiving the highest vot e are elected and meet on the first Monday, after the second Wednesday in December, to vote for their party’s nominees. Even though the members of the Electoral College ar e pledged to vote for the presidential candidate of their Party, they are not constitutionally bound to do so, and can change their mind at any time. Technically, how ever, a candidate wins all of the state’s electoral votes, if he wins a majority of t he popular votes. If a presidential candidate has the largest popular vote, but doesn’t obtain the necessary electoral votes, he doesn’t win the Presidency. This happened in 182 4, 1876, 1888, and 2000. If no candidate has a majority, then the House of Represe ntatives chooses a President from the three highest candidates, with all the Represen tatives from each state combining to cast one vote for each state. If a Vice)Presidentia l candidate receives no clear majority, then the Senate chooses from the top two, with each Senator casting an individual vote. Therefore, the candidate’s objective is not to win a majority of the popular vote, but a majority of the electoral votes, which is 270. Thus , if a candidate could be guaranteed just eleven states (leaving 267 remaining electoral votes in 39 states, and the District of Columbia), he could be guaranteed the Presidency: C alifornia (55), Texas (34), New York (31), Florida (27), Pennsylvania (21), Illinoi s (21), Ohio (20), Michigan (17), New Jersey (15), Georgia (15), and North Carolina (15). Combined, these states have 271 electoral votes. That is why you see a concentration of effort in th ese states at election time. With the I Iluminati controlling the media in these large popu lation centers, it is not a difficult task to alter public opinion and sway votes to the candidate they choose.

A forerunner of this group was the London Mercers Company, and earlier than that, the London Staplers. The org anization traced their lineage back to the ancient commercial groups involved in trading b etween the Mediterranean and India. They were closely related to the Levant Comp any, and the Anglo)Muscovy Company, and spawned the London Company, which was chartered in 1606 by King James I, to establish the Virginia Plantation on a communistic basis, and the Plymouth Colony in 1621. King James I It was mainly organized for trading, but soon becam e an agent for British imperialism. Bending to government pressure, they r eorganized in 1702. Every year, 24 Directors were elected by the Court of Proprietors (or shareholders, a majority of which were English Masons). They traded in cotton, tea, s ilk, and salt peter; and were accused of dealing with opium and participating in the slave trade. They virtually monopolized all trade from South India, the Persian Gulf, Southeast Asia and East Asia. Indian policy was influenced by the company from 17 57 to 1773, when their power was broken by the 1773 Regulatory Act, and Pitt’s I ndia Act of 1784, finally ending their monopoly in 1813. When they ceased to exist in 1873 , many of its shareholders were major financiers. The principals of this group perp etuated their elitist goals by establishing the Fabian Society. In 1606, King James also chartered the Virginia Com pany, a joint stock corporation made up of a group of London entrepreneurs, charged with establishing Jamestown, in"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"the Chesapeake region of North America known as Vir ginia. It had the authority to appoint the Council of Virginia, the Governor, and other officials; and also had the responsibility to provide settlers, supplies, and s hips for the venture. Although initially favorable, as the mortality rate rose, and the pros pect for profit faded, the support for it began to decline. They resorted to lotteries, searc hing for gold, and silkworm production to increase their chances of making a profit. Altho ugh Great Britain controlled the colony through this company, because of the Indian Massacr e of 1622, the Charter was revoked in 1624, and Virginia became a Crown colony . THE FABIAN SOCIETY On October 24, 1883, in London, a group of 17 wealt hy Socialists gathered to discuss a ‘Fellowship of the New Life,’ which was b ased on the writings of scholar Thomas Davidson, who hoped to start some sort of mo nastic order. The group included: George Bernard Shaw (1864)1926), a free)thinking Ma rxist)atheist writer whose plays contained socialistic references, an ideology he pu rsued after hearing a speech by American economist Henry George in 1882, and readin g Marx’s Das Kapital ; Graham Wallas, a classical scholar; Sidney James Webb (185 9)1947), a civil servant who was the most influential socialist in the country; Edwa rd Pease; Havelock Ellis; Frank Podmore; Annie Besant; John Galsworthy; R.

They had 74 local chapters in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, I ndia, South Africa, Spain, Denmark, and Germany. In 1899, The Fabian Essays , the most noted work on socialism, was written by seven influential members of the Society, and edite d by Shaw. It became the blueprint for socialistic legislation, and was later reprinte d in 1908, 1920, 1931, and 1952. Fabian leaders were drawn to Herbert George Wells ( 1866)1946), and his ideas of the ‘New Republic’ which he described as “a sort of outspoken Secret Society ... an informal and open freemasonry,” made up of the educ ated class, whose common goals would lead to the creation of a new World State, th us saving the human race from disaster. Known as the ‘Prophet of Our Time’ becaus e of writing about many things before they came to be, in books like The Time Machine and War of the Worlds ; Wells would give the Fabians the notoriety they needed. E dward Pease, Secretary of the Fabians, wrote to H. G. Wells on January 10, 1902, to say that Webb and his wife Beatrice, were the “pioneers of your New Republic.” Herbert George Wells Sponsored by Wallas and Shaw, Wells joined them in February, 1903. In his first lecture after joining, he said that the World State was a necessity. In his 1905 book, A Modern Utopia , he wrote of the World State taking control and cr eating a “sane order,” and how they maintained a central records system in Paris, which they used to keep track of every person on Earth, and aided the state to eliminate the unfit. Wells was unimpressed with the Fabians, and called for expansion, by raising money, getting new offices, appointing a new staff, and relaxing the guidelines for membership. He wanted to initiate an all)out propag anda campaign, and outlined his views in a paper called The Faults of the Fabians , which dealt with the need for reorganization, and why he wanted to change their n ame to the ‘British Socialist Society.’ His views were not shared by the Fabian i nner circle, and in September, 1908, he resigned. Wells maintained his socialistic views, and in 1928 , wrote The Open Conspiracy: Blueprints for a World Revolution , which was an elaboration of ideas from his 1926 b ook The World of William Clissold , which gave a seven)point program for the developm ent of the “new human community,” and was inspired by t he rise of communism. These"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"ideas had been fleshed out in his 1897 short story A Story of the Days to Come , and his 1901 book, Anticipations of the Reaction to Mechanical and Sci entific Progress Upon Human Life and Thought . The character, Clissold, had called his project for world revolution, the “open conspiracy,” which meant: “Cthe establishment of the economic world)state by the deliberate invitation, explicit discussion, and cooperation of the men mos t interested in economic organization, men chosen by their work, called to i t by a natural disposition and aptitude for it, fully aware of its importance and working with the support of an increasing general understanding ... It is not a pr oject to overthrow existing governments by insurrectionary attacks, but to supe rsede them by disregard. It does not want to destroy them or alter their forms but to make them negligible by replacing their functions. It will respect them as far as it must. What is useful of them it will use; what is useless it will efface by its stronger reality; it will join issue only with what is plainly antagonistic and ac tively troublesome.” His plan was to be accomplished by “an intelligent minority ... without the support of the crowd and possibly in spite of its dissent...” The Open Conspiracy was Wells’ perspective of his New Republic, which represented a classless World State that controlled everything. Its establishment would be accomplished by “functional men, men of high nat ural intelligence and professional competence, who performed the creative and manageri al work of the world.” They were recruited from “the men and women whose knowledge, skill, creative gifts made them indispensable to modern society” who would “gradual ly have the reins of power into their hands.” The revolution was to begin through t he “formation of small groups of friends, family groups, groups of students and empl oyees or other sorts of people meeting and conversing frequently in the course of normal occupations.” They were to “enlarge themselves and attempt to establish commun ications with kindred groups for common ends.” He further elaborated: “The Open Conspiracy will ap pear first, I believe, as a conscious organization of intelligent, and in some cases wealthy men, as a movement having distinct social and political aims, confesse dly ignoring most of the existing apparatus of political control, or using it only as an incidental implement in the stages, a mere movement of a number of people in a certain di rection, who will presently discover, with a sort of surprise, the common objec t toward which they are all moving. In all sorts of ways, they will be influencing and con trolling the ostensible government.” He also wrote: “From the outset, the Open Conspirac y will set its face against militarism,” in the sense that they will encourage “refusal to serve in any war (as conscientious objectors) ... For the furtherance of its aims, the Open Conspiracy may work in alliance with all sorts of movements and pe ople ... (and) restricted movements will attend only to a portion of its program.” According to Wells, expansion would occur through: “branching and development ... (with) the Open Cons piracy as consisting of a great multitude and variety of overlapping groups, but now all organized for"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"collective political, social and educational as wel l as propagandist action. They will recognize each other much more clearly than th ey did at first and they will have acquired a common name ... The character of th e Open Conspiracy will now be plainly displayed. It will have become a gre at world movement as widespread and evident as socialism and communism. It will largely have taken the place of these movements. It will be more, it w ill be a world)religion. This large loose assimilatory mass of groups and societi es will be definitely and obviously attempting to swallow up the entire popul ation of the world and become the new human community.” Two years later, in a published article titled “The Banker,” Wells even included the international banking houses in Clissold’s “open co nspiracy” through a three)point program that would by)pass governments by negotiati ng agreements stabilizing the currency, adjusting credit availability to control the fluctuation of business, and the withdrawal of credit to governments or armament ind ustries who instigate an arms race. It is obvious that Wells either based his writings on the actual plans of the Fabian elitists, or used his knowledge of what they had al ready done in order to formulate a theory of what they were going to do in the future. Since he did quit, were these writings meant to be an exposé or a warning; or was he just stating facts, daring people to try and stop them. We don’t know his intent, but what w e do know, was that he was incredibly prophetic in his description of their me thods. It would indeed be a ‘blueprint’ for the manner in which the I Iluminati would entrench itself in our governmental affairs. Edward Bernays, former head of CBS)TV, and a friend of H. G. Wells, wrote in his 1928 book, Propaganda: “As civilization becomes more complex, and as the need for invisible government has been increasingly demonstr ated, the technical means have been invented and developed by which public opinion may be regimented. With printing press and newspaper, the telephone, telegraph, radi o and airplanes, ideas can be spread rapidly, and even instantaneously, across th e whole of America.” These tools would be fully utilized to begin the destruction of America.

The aims of the Fabian Society was developed by Web b, from what Englishman John Ruskin (1819)1900) taught at Oxford University . Ruskin, a teacher at the Working Men’s College (founded in 1854 by Christian)Sociali st philosopher J. F. D. Maurice), a professor of Fine Arts at Oxford, an artist and wri ter, based his views on those of Socialist Robert Owen. He advocated a utopian socie ty, and espoused theories developed from the teachings of Plato (428)347 BC), who had studied under Socrates, and became the greatest philosopher in history. Pla to established an academy which operated for 800 years, producing many great men, i ncluding Aristotle. In his work, The Republic , he outlined his ideal society, which was an arist ocratic society ruled by the elite. It included the elimination of marriage and the family, and introduced selective breeding by the government, who would destroy all i nferior offspring. In Plato’s utopia, sexual equality dictated that women would fight alo ngside the men in times of war.  John Ruskin J. Frederick Denison Maurice Robert O wen   Socrates  Plato The Fabians were working towards a new world, by in doctrinating young scholars who would eventually rise to power in various polic y)making positions throughout the world; by infiltrating educational institutions, go vernment agencies, and political parties. Their strategy was called the “doctrine of inevitab ility of gradualism,” which meant that"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"their goals would be gradually achieved. So gradual , that nobody would notice, or “without breach of continuity or abrupt change of t he entire social issue.” The secret was evolution, not revolution, or what Webb called “per meation.” Shaw (whose mistress, Florence Farr, was a witch in the Order of the Gold en Dawn), revealed that their goal was to be achieved by “stealth, intrigue, subversio n, and the deception of never calling socialism by its right name.” Florence Farr In fact, that’s how they got their name. The name o riginated from the Roman Consul, General Quintus Fabius Maximus, the Cunctator (‘Del ayer’), who through patient, cautious, delaying and elusive tactics, during the early phases of the Second Punic War (218)201 BC), enabled the Roman army to regroup and defeat Hannibal’s stronger Carthaginian army. One good example of this concept is television. Eve r since Bible reading and prayer have been taken out of schools, the entertainment i ndustry has been slowly and methodically taking bolder steps in the content of their programming. We are seeing things being televised, which would have never been considered thirty and forty years ago. Nudity done in ‘good taste,’ or done to be cul turally or historically accurate, is acceptable. Obscene language is tolerated (especial ly on the radio), if it is an essential part of the plot. Even though the level of sex and violence is increasing, the rate of complaints to the television networks is decreasing . This shows a gradual acceptance on the part of the public, or what the network boss es call the “relaxing of moral standards.” This was done to brainwash our children to constantly bombard them with trash that would influence them, and turn them away from God. This is so evident with the concept of music videos, which have been able t o combine sex and violence along with a hard driving musical composition that has be en shown to ferment rebellion in young people.

Rhodes began developing his philosophy after hearin g a speech by John Ruskin (1819)1900) at Christ Church at Oxford University, which espoused an opinion, which by extension, furthered the teaching found in Plato ’s Republic . Plato called for “...a ruling class with a powerful army to keep it in pow er and a society completely subordinate to the monolithic authority of the rule rs.” Rhodes was also greatly influenced by Windom Reade’s book The Martyrdom of Man , published in 1872, which advocated Darwinism and the tremendous suffering th at man must undergo, which was epitomized in the phrase “the survival of the fitte st.” The book said that the “inevitable progress of man (was) to perfection.” Rhodes incorp orated this rationalization into his thinking.

He said in 1877: “It is our duty to seize e very opportunity of acquiring more territory ... more territory simply means more of t he Anglo)Saxon race, more of the best, the most human, most honorable race the world posse sses ... the absorption of the greater portion of the world under our rule simply means the end of all wars.” It was this"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"mentality that fueled his desire to unite the world under one form of government.

The Outer Circle was known as the ‘Association of H elpers,’ but was not implemented until 1909)1913, when Milner established it as the Round Table organization. Their goal was to eventually establish a one)world government, which would be controlled by the international banking community, under the cloak of socialism. They saw England, not as a European power, but as an Atlantic power, and wanted to have a federation of the English)speaking world, which would be controlled b y them. In 1897, British and American elitists met in order to come up with ways to accomplish Rhodes’ plan to consolidate their respec tive governments, which would pave the way for a one)world government. On July 24 , 1902, a secret organization known as the Pilgrim Society was started in London. Six months later, an American branch was established in New York.

Their secret aims were “to coordinate the international activiti es and outlooks of all the English) speaking world into one ... to work to maintain pea ce; to help backward, colonial, and underdeveloped areas to advance towards stability, law and order, and prosperity, along the lines somehow similar to those taught at Oxford and the University of London...” The Council on Foreign Relations, and the Institute of International Affairs, both supporters of Wilson, strongly supported the League of Nations. However, the Round Table wanted to weaken the League by eliminating th e possibility of collective security in order to strengthen Germany, and isolate England from Europe so an Atlantic power could be established, consisting of England, the Br itish Dominions, and the United States. In 1921, when it became apparent that the U nited States wasn’t going to join the League, the Council on Foreign Relations was incorp orated on July 21st, consisting of members from both groups, and others who had partic ipated in the 1919 Paris Peace Talks.

Even after a July 15, 1971 statement on Radio Peking in China that called for the “people of the world, (to) unite and defeat the U.S. aggressors and all their running dogs,” Nixon accepted an invitation by Prem ier Chou En Lai to go to China, where the groundwork for trade relations was establ ished.

Haldeman, in January, 1971, to get his Special Coun sel Charles Colson to get the proof so that they could expose him. It was believed that the second break)in at the Democratic National Committee on June 16)17, 1972, was to retrieve any derogatory information the Democrats had on the Republicans, b ut it was later revealed that the main goal was to place a bug on the frequently used phone that was in the area of the DNC that housed the offices of R.

The objective was to reverse the outcome of the public election.” There had been an article in the Washington Post pertaining to a secret contribution to the Republi can Party, and this group of Democrats had went to him, seeking more in formation to use against Nixon. The three people that Vesco dealt with, “were names that everyone would recognize (who) held extremely high posts in past Administrat ions.” Vesco told New York Times writer Neil Cullinan, that Watergate was intentiona lly created to stop Nixon.

McCord, Jr., the security chief for the Committee t o Re)Elect the President, has been accused of being a double agent, and used to bring Nixon down by sabotaging the break)in at the Watergate Hotel. There is evidence to believe that the police had be en tipped off on the night of the break)in. Detective Lt. Carl Shoffler, and three ot her officers, who usually went off duty at midnight, just happened to stay on for the next shift, and was parked just a minute away from the hotel complex. When the security guar d, Frank Wills, found the tape on the door, and called the police, it was those offic ers who came immediately to arrest the White House ‘plumbers’ (Special Investigations Unit ). To top it off, McCord and Shoffler were friends. McCord had entered the Watergate while it was still open, and put some tape on one of the doors so it wouldn’t lock. The tape was put on horizontally, so that it could be seen between the doors. When the ‘plumbers’ arrived hours later, instead of the doors being open, they were locked, which indicated that the piece of tape had been discovered. They left, since there was no longer an y assurance of a successful operation. McCord told them to go back and pick the lock, since the police had not been called. E. Howard Hunt and his Cuban accomplices, d id this, and left tape on the door for McCord to get in. About five minutes later, he joined them. He was supposed to remove the tape from the door, but he didn’t; howev er, he told the other ‘plumbers’ that he did. He also instructed them to shut)off their w alkie)talkies, so the static wouldn’t be heard, which means they were inside the office with out being able to hear any outside communications taking place. They were caught, when Wills discovered the door taped for a second time. "},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"   James McCor d   E.

This came after Nixon held a press conference to say: “There is no involvement b y the White House.” In the years since Watergate occurred, one simple f act seems to have emerged, and that is, that Nixon probably had no prior knowledge of the break)in. White House Counsel John Dean III ordered it and “deceived the President of the United States into joining a conspiracy to obstruct justice in order t o cover up a crime that Nixon had not committed.”   Jo hn Dean III  Alexander M.

After a short tour of duty in Vietnam in 1 966, where he was decorated for bravery, he was made a full colonel in 1968. He tra nsferred to West Point to assist Commandant Gen. Andrew Goodpaster (CFR) for two yea rs, after which Goodpaster recommended Haig to Kissinger in 1969, and Haig was put on the National Security Council. In less than a year, he was promoted to ge neral, and in two more years, to major)general. Although he had served only four mon ths as a battalion commander, and one month as a brigade commander, in 1972 he was gi ven four stars, and nominated for Army Vice Chief of Staff. It was said, that 183 other generals, who were more deserving, were passed over. Ford would later promo te him to Supreme Allied Commander in Europe. He resigned in 1979 because he was critical of Carter’s defense and foreign policies. He became the chief operating officer of United Technologies, only to return to government for 18 months as Reagan’s S ecretary of State. Haig was a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. John Dean claimed that ‘Deep Throat,’ the man who l eaked information to Bob Woodward of the Washington Post , was Alexander Haig. Haig denied it. Woodward had claimed that he didn’t meet Haig until 1973, howeve r, it has since been revealed that prior to Woodward becoming a reporter, he was a lie utenant in the Navy, and as a special briefing officer, and had contact with Haig at the National Security Office in the White House. It now appears that Haig had a huge ro le in bringing Nixon down. So why did the I Iluminati turn against Nixon? In addition to the pr eviously mentioned economical changes, he infuriated Kissinger by bomb ing North Vietnam without consulting anyone. It was even rumored that Nixon w as planning to get rid of Kissinger. However, Kissinger was the I Iluminati’s man in the White House, and his job was to control Nixon, so he was the one running the show. Henry Kissinger Some very interesting information surfaced about He nry Kissinger. In 1961, Col. Gen. Michael Goleniewski, of Polish Intelligence (G ZI), defected to the United States, bringing with him 5,000 pages of secret documents, 160 microfilms of secret reports, 800 pages of Russian intelligence reports, plus the names of hundreds of Soviet agents in American and Europe. State Department Security O fficer, John Norpel, Jr., testified before the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee th at the information provided by"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"Goleniewski was never proven to be inaccurate, and Goleniewski was honored by the 88th Congress for his efforts. The documents indicated that after World War II, Ru ssia established an ODRA spy ring in Poland to infiltrate British and American i ntelligence. The GZI, discovered that one communist agent, code)named ‘Bor,’ had worked w ith another agent, Ernst Bosenhard (a clerk at the U.S. Intelligence Headqua rters in Oberammergau, Germany), who had been sending secret documents to Moscow. Bo senhard was convicted of espionage in 1951. ‘Bor’ returned to the United Sta tes, and was secretly working with the CIA, while teaching at Harvard University. ‘Bor ’ was identified as Sgt. Henry Alfred Kissinger. Kissinger became a consultant on security matters d uring the Administrations of Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Johnson; and served as Nel son Rockefeller’s chief advisor on foreign affairs. In his book White House Years , he called Rockefeller, “the single most influential person in my life.” His book, Nuclear Weapons and Foreign Policy , in 1957, established him as the leading authority on U .S. strategic policy, and he was the one who initiated the Strategic Arms Limitation Tal ks (SALT). There should be little doubt where his allegiances are in regard to his su pport of one)world government. This story took on additional meaning, when in 1965 , former CIA Chief of Research and Analysis, Herman E. Kimsey, used fingerprint, d ental and medical records, handwriting analysis, blood tests, and interviews w ith childhood friends and relatives to reach a conclusion that Goleniewski was actually Al eksei Romanoff, the son of Nicholas II, who survived the alleged Communist massacre of the Russian Royal family. The Bolshevik government had claimed, that in the m iddle of the night, July 16, 1918, they had captured the seven members of the Ru ssian Imperial family, which included the Czar Nicholas, his wife (Alexandra), s on (Aleksei), and four daughters (Olga, Tatiana, Maria, and Anastasia); as well as D r. Eugene Botkin, the imperial physician, and three servants; and murdered them in the basement of the Ipatiev house in Ekaterinburg (now Sverdlovsk). They took their b odies fourteen miles away to the abandoned Four Brothers Mine, soaked the bodies wit h gasoline, attempted to burn them, and buried them in the swamp. They were only successful in burning the two youngest ones, Aleksei and Anastasia. Their persona l belongings were thrown down a mine shaft. Fearing that they would be discovered, two days later, the bodies were retrieved. Those remaining were buried in the middl e of a dirt road, where in 1979, they were discovered by a local historian and Soviet tel evision personality, who excavated two skulls, analyzed them, and then reburied them. The discovery was finally announced in 1989.

In 1995, the tests result s were released, which indicated that the remains were that of the Royal family. However, many Russians doubted the claims, and in 1998, when a funeral was finally held, the h ead of the Russian Orthodox Church ordered the officiating priest not to refer to Roma nov’s by name, but instead, as the “victims of the Revolution.” The priest said before the funeral: “The truth is I don’t know who I am burying.” According to the official report, there were a tota l of 23 people in the cellar, which measured 17 feet by 14 feet. One of the first inves tigator’s on the scene, Captain Malinovsky, of the Officer’s Commission, concluded: “As a result of my work on this case I became convinced that the imperial family wa s alive. It appeared to me that the Bolsheviks had shot someone in the room in order to simulate the murder of the imperial familyC” Some have suggested that it was o nly Dr. Botkin and the servants who were shot. In December, 1970, documents released by the Britis h Government revealed that President Wilson backed a secret mission to Russia that resulted in the rescue of the Czar and his family, who were smuggled out of Russi a in the back of trucks, and then taken by ship to Europe where they have lived since 1918. The Report said that, “Sir William Wiseman, a partner in the New York banking house of Kuhn, Loeb & Co.,”"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"received $75,000 from the U.S. government as part o f a “scheme” for a secret mission to rescue the Czar and his family. William Wiseman Prince Kuli)Mirza, commander of the ‘White Russian’ forces, believed that the Royal family survived, and showed Gleb Botkin, the son of the Czar’s doctor, documents which said that “the imperial family had first been taken to a monastery in the province of Perm, and later to Denmark.” A 1919 book called Rescuing the Czar , by James P. Smyth, who identified himself as an American secret agent, revealed how he led the Romanovs through a secret tunnel to the British Con sulate in Ekaterinburg, and from there they were secretly taken to Tibet. The remains of the two youngest of the Romanov chil dren, Aleksei and Maria, have never officially been located; and through the year s, there has been some evidence to suggest that Aleksei and Anastasia may have survive d the execution. An entry in the diary of Richard Meinertzhagen, a former British in telligence agent, suggested that one of the Czar’s daughters escaped; and in the 1993 bo ok The Romanov Conspiracies , British writer, Michael Occleshaw, also claimed tha t one of the Czar’s daughters survived. The Treaty of Brest)Litovsk between Russia and Germ any, which was signed on March 3, 1918 to end the hostilities between them, was said to also contain a codicil that guaranteed that the Romanov’s would not be har med. The Russian people were to continue believing that they were dead, so the comm unists could replace the monarchy. It had been hoped that the Bolshevik government wou ldn’t survive, so they could return, but it never happened. On June 11, 1971, the New York Daily Mirror announced the exclusive publication of “Reminiscences of Observations” by ‘His Imperial Highness Aleksei Nicholaevich Romanoff, Tsarevich and Grand Duke of Russia.’ The U.S. Government never officially recognized Goleniewski as a Romanov, because histor y reported that prince had suffered from hemophilia, an incurable genetic dise ase– but Goleniewski didn’t.

Goleniewski pledged that as the Czar’s heir, if he would be granted his rightful inheritance, he would use the money to destroy Communism. Nixon also angered the I Iluminati because of his choice of Vice Presidents. After Vice President Spiro Agnew resigned because of inco me tax evasion charges, Establishment insiders had urged Nixon to appoint N elson Rockefeller. However, Nixon instead, appointed Gerald Ford to be his Vice Presi dent (who, when he became President, did appoint Rockefeller to be his VP). I f Rockefeller would have been appointed, he would have become President after Nix on was destroyed. So, Nixon ruined their plans, and may have known that, becaus e after he resigned, he was having problem with a swollen leg, and said that if he wou ld have gone to Bethesda Naval Hospital to get it taken care of, he would have “ne ver come out alive.”  Spiro T. Agnew  Nelson Rockefeller  Gerald Ford Later, Lynette “Squeaky” Fromme would attempt to sh oot Ford on September 5, 1975; and on September 22, 1975, Sara Jane Moore wo uld also attempt to shoot Ford. Moore said she was trying to expose the nation’s “p hony system of government” by elevating “Nelson Rockefeller to the Presidency.” I n a June, 1976, Playboy interview, she said that there was a “part that I don’t think I can talk about. I just haven’t figured out a way to talk about it and protect everyone. I’ m not saying that anyone helped me plan it. I’m not just saying that there are other t hings– which means there are other people, though not in terms of a conspiracy. There are areas I’m not willing to talk about for a lot of reasons.” The article also said that U .S. District Judge Samuel Conti, “added to the air of mystery surrounding her case (and) se aled all the trial evidence.” This certainly gives some serious overtones to the attem pts on Ford’s life, and if they were actually intended to elevate Rockefeller to the Pre sidency. "},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"   Lynette Fromme Sara Jane Moore The bottom line seems to be, that Nixon got cocky. With the I Iluminati hoping to have world control by 1976 (it was “rescheduled” fo r the mid)eighties), Nixon was hoping to follow in the steps of Woodrow Wilson and Franklin D. Roosevelt who were virtual dictators, and began acting on his own to b ring about change, so he could head the world government. On May 21, 1971, James Reston (CFR) wrote in an article that appeared in the New York Times : “Mr. Nixon would obviously like to preside over t he creation of a new world order, and believes he sees an opportunity to do so in the last twenty months of his first term.” It is likely that the plan to get rid of Nixon was beginning to take shape at that time. James Reston In the summer of 1973, Republicans partial to Nixon had announced to the Washington media that they wanted Nixon to be elect ed to a third term and had organized a group known as ‘The Committee to Repeal the Twenty)Second Amendment.’ The movement sort of died within a coup le of weeks. Then in October, came the rumor that Nixon may be considering a mili tary coup to stay in office. Gen. Alexander Haig told the Congress during his confirm ation hearings for the position of Secretary of State on January, 1981, that some peop le in Washington were “flirting with solutions which would have been extra)Constitutiona l.” Watergate Special Prosecutor Leon Jaworski warned the grand jury, that if they d ecided to indict Nixon, he may use force to remain in office.

He kept saying, ‘This is our last and best hope. The last chance to resist the fascists’ (of the left). His w ords brought me straight up out of my chair.

Acknowledge receipt.” Rather than a plot by the I Iluminati to militarily take over the government, i t seemed to be more of an attempt by Nixon to keep from gett ing pushed out of office by the powers that actually run this country. In the end, he knew what kind of power he was dealing with, and resigned his office on August 9th , rather than risk what remaining credibility he had, by trying to grab what he could not hold. His resignation also prevented an impeachment trial, which may have allo wed secret information to come to light. THE CFR AND THEIR GOALS The CFR’s “1980’s Project,” evolved from a Council Study Group on International Order, which had met from 1971)73. They sought to d uplicate the success they had achieved with the War & Peace Studies, and their co ncentration was to be on creating a new political and economic system that would have g lobal emphasis. Miriam Camps, former Vice)Chairperson of the State Department’s P olicy Planning Council, recorded the group’s discussion in a report called The Management of Independence , which called for “the kind of international system which we should be seeking to nudge things.” In the fall of 1973, the 1980’s Project was initiat ed, and to accommodate it, the CFR staff was expanded, and additional funds raised, in cluding $1.3 million in grants from the Ford, Lilly, Mellon and Rockefeller Foundations . The Coordinating Committee had"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"14 men, with a full)time staff; plus 12 groups, eac h with 20 members; in addition to other experts and advisors who acted as consultants to th e project.

Stanley Hoffman, a chief participant of the Project , wrote a book in 1978, called Primacy or World Order , which he said was an “illegitimate offspring” of the Project. Basically, it was a summary of the Project’s work, and concluded that the best chance for foreign policy success, was to adopt a “world o rder policy.” Stanley Hoffman When Jimmy Carter was elected to the Presidency in 1976, some of the Project’s strongest supporters, such as Cyrus Vance, Michael Blumenthal, Marshall Shulman, and Paul Warnke, went to the White House to serve i n the new Administration.

A major source of their funding (since 1953), stems from providing a “corporate service” to over 100 companies for a minimum fee of $1,000, that furnishes subscribers with inside information on what is going on politic ally and financially, both internationally and domestically; by providing free consultation, u se of their extensive library, a subscription to Foreign Affairs , and by holding seminars on reports and research d one for the Executive branch. They also publish books a nd pamphlets, and have regular dinner meetings to allow speakers and members to pr esent positions, award study fellowships to scholars, promote regional meetings and stage round)table discussion meetings. Being that the Council on Foreign Relations was abl e to infiltrate our government, it is no wonder that our country has been traveling on the course that it has. The moral, educational and financial decline of this nation ha s been no accident. It has been due to a carefully contrived plot on behalf of these consp irators, who will be satisfied with nothing less than a one)world government. And it is coming to that. As each year goes by, the momentum is picking up, and it is becoming increasingly clear, what road our government is taking. The proponents of one)world g overnment are becoming less secretive, as evidenced by George Bush’s talk of a “New World Order.” The reason for that is that they feel it is too late for their pla ns to be stopped. They have become so entrenched in our government, our financial structu re, and our commerce, that they probably do control this country, if not the world. In light of this, it seems that it will be only a matter of time before their plans are fully implemented.

At the age of 21, Brookings had become a partner in Cupples and Marston (a manufacturer of w oodenware and cordage), which, ten years later, under his leadership, expanded and flourished. In 1896, at the age of 46, he retired to devote his duties towards higher education, and became President of Washington University’s Board of Trustees, which, t hrough the next twenty years, turned into a major university. He was one of the o riginal Trustees of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, and a consultant to the Commission on Economy and Efficiency during the Taft Administration. In 1 917, he was appointed to President Wilson’s War Industries Board (which had the respon sibility of receiving and distributing the supplies needed by the military), later becomin g Chairman of its Price Fixing Committee (responsible for negotiating prices for a ll goods purchased by the Allied governments), which gave him a key role in the Wils on Administration. Robert Somers Brookings At the age of 70, he took over the leadership of th e Institute for Government Research (IGR, founded by lawyer and economist Fred erick A. Cleveland in 1916), and raised $750,000 from 92 corporations and a dozen pr ivate citizens, to get it moving. Their first project was to push for legislation cre ating a federal budget, which was successful. The first U.S. Budget Director, under P resident Harding, was Charles G.

In 1924, he established the Robert S. Brookings School of Economics and Government (an outgrowth of Washington University in St. Louis), to allow doctoral student s to spend time in Washington, D.C. to work on the staffs of the IGR and the Institute of Economics. In 1927, he merged all three organizations to form the Brookings Institution, whose purpose was to train future government officials.

With the financial backing of the Rockefeller Found ation, the Carnegie Corporation, and the Mellon Trust, Pasvolsky initiated an Internatio nal Studies Group, which developed the basis for the Marshall Plan, to aid the Europea n war recovery efforts. In 1951, the Chicago Tribune said that the Brooking s Institution had created an “elaborate program of training and indoctrination i n global thinking,” and that most of its scholars wind up as policy makers in the State Depa rtment. Truman was the first President to turn to them for help. In 1941, he nam ed Brookings Vice President Edwin Nouse as the first Chairman of the President’s Coun cil of Economic Advisors. Kennedy and Johnson appointed many of their members to key posts. Carter’s foreign policy became a resting place for the many of the group’s recommendations. President Johnson said that the purpose of his ‘Gre at Society’ legislation was to “try to take all of the money that we think is unnecessa rily being spent and take it from the ‘haves’ and give it to the ‘have)nots’ that need it so much.” Ralph Epperson, author of The Unseen Hand , one of the best books about the Master Conspiracy, said that Johnson was a “closet Communist.” Another well)kno wn researcher, John Coleman, said that the Brookings Institute had developed and drafted the Great Society programs which were “in every detail, simply lifted from Fab ian Socialist papers drawn up in England. In some instances, Brookings did not even bother to change the titles of the Fabian Society papers. Once such instance was using ‘Great Society,’ which was taken directly from a Fabian Socialist paper from the sam e title.” After Socialist leader Eugene Debs died in 1926, Socialist Norman Thomas, who gra duated from and was ordained by the Union Theological Seminary, became the leade r of the Socialist Party, running for President six times.

It purported to be an outline for the control of the world by the Jews, with the help of the Masons. The document has been used to prove that the I Iluminati is an exclusively Jewish plan for world domination, and h as put the Jewish race in a bad light. In the course of some very intense research, I have not found any concrete evidence to prove this accusation. There is no “Jewish” conspir acy. Even though the I Iluminati’s founders were Jewish, and many influential Jews wer e part of the inner circle, that is no reason to indict the entire Jewish race. The Bible identifies the Jews as God’s chosen peopl e, so it is highly unlikely that, as a race, they are behind such a Satanic plot. It has even been said that the people in Israel are not true Jews. One only has to look at t he history of Israel, and see how they have been able to miraculously survive, to see that this is nothing but anti)Semitic rhetoric. It is not race, which is the common denom inator here; it is money and greed. For the most part, the conspiracy has been dominate d by the Europeans, and perpetuated by the English)speaking countries of th e world. No one is quite sure about this notorious document, and how it fits into the puzzle of the one)world government conspiracy. We know that i ts influence was taken advantage of, by the I Iluminati, however, as to the actual origin and its purpose, we may never know for sure, because portions of it are highly ac curate in its revelations. It is either true, or a clever forgery. If it is true, how much of it is true? If it is a forgery, it most certainly was based upon a factual document. Whatev er the case, it is included in this book because it may contain some clues about the ea rly stages of the I Iluminati conspiracy, and the people behind it. French Jesuit, the Abbé Barruel, who in 1797 wrote the five)volume Memoire pou servir á l ́histoire du Jacobinisme , received a copy of a letter in 1806, from J. B. Simonini, an army officer in Florence. In it was a statement that the Jews “promised themselves that in less than a century, they would be the masters of the world.” This letter had been widely circulated in France. It was later revealed that the letter had been fabricated by the French police to turn Napoleon ag ainst the Jews. "},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":" A copy of Barruel’s book In 1848, Hermann Goedsche, a German postal official , forged letters indicating that Benedic Waldeck was conspiring to assassinate Frede rick William IV, the King of Prussia. After it became known that they were forge ries, he was removed from his job, and he began writing under the pseudonym, Sir John Retcliffe. One of those novels, Biarritz , written in 1868, contained a chapter titled, “In the Jewish Cemetery in Prague,” in which the heads of the twelve tribes of Israel m et with Satan to tell him of their plans to control the world. However, the covert proceedin g was witnessed by two men, who then dedicated their lives to fighting the Satanic Jewish plot. In 1872, Russian anti) Semites printed the chapter in a pamphlet, as ficti on based on fact. It was reprinted in 1876 and 1880. In July, 1881, the story was publish ed in the French paper Le Contemporain as fact, and all of the speeches by each tribal he ad were consolidated into a single speech, supposedly made by a chief ra bbi in a secret meeting of influential Jews. To substantiate the claim, it was said to hav e been taken from a forthcoming book by English diplomat, Sir John Readclif (a take )off on Goedsche’s pen name), called Annals of the Political and Historic Events of the Last Ten Years . In 1891, the story appeared in the Russian newspape r Novorossiysky Telegraf , which established that the speech was made in 1869 by a rabbi to a secret Sanhedrin (possibly referring to the First Congress of Reform ed Judaism, held in Leipzig). Its authenticity, again, was supported by the fictional Sir John Readclif. Later, in the October 21, 1920 issue of La Vielle France , the newspaper said there was a striking analogy between the Protocols of the Elders of Zion and the discourse of Rabbi"},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":"Reichhorn, presented in Prague in 1869, over the to mb of the Grand Rabbi Simeon) ben)Ihuda. Early in 1900, this fictional speech was used to in stigate pogroms against the Jews, and became known as “The Rabbi’s Speech.” An anti)S emite, P. A. Khrushevan, used the speech to provoke a pogrom at Kishinev, in the Ukraine, in 1903, in which 45 Jews were killed, and 400 injured, in an incident that d estroyed 1,300 Jewish homes and shops. The speech is now used to prove the authenti city of the Protocols. The document known as the Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion , seems to be a conglomeration of many anti)Jewish publications dur ing that period. In 1869, Gougenot de Mousseaux wrote a book that said that the world was being taken over by a group of Satan)worshipping Jews, out of which a man would em erge that the Jews would worship as their returned Messiah. In 1881, Abbé Ch abauty wrote a 600)page book that said Satan was using the Jews to prepare the way fo r the Antichrist. His second book, published in 1882, included two letters that were a llegedly written in 1489 by a Jewish leader who spoke of the Jews rising up to “dominate the world.” These letters have come to be known as the Letter of the Jews of Constantinople . They were actually satirical comments on the Spanish Jews. In 1893, Monsignor Meurin, the Archbishop of Port L ouis, Mauritius, said: “Freemasonry is fundamentally Jewish, exclusively J ewish, passionately Jewish, from the beginning to the end,” and that “someday histor y will tell how all the revolutions of recent centuries originated in the Masonic sect und er the supreme command of the Jews.” He said that the Masons of the 33rd degree w ere the leaders of the conspiracy, and indeed the Protocols are signed: “...by the rep resentatives of Zion, of the 33rd degree.” In World Conquest by the Jews , Osman)Bey wrote, that in 1840, a meeting of eminent Jewish leaders was held in Cracow, Poland, to discuss the expansion of Judaism over the entire world. This book became the framework for the Protocols. Victor E. Marsden, the Russian correspondent for The Morning Post of London, wrote in his 1934 English translation of the Protoc ols, that in 1884, Joseph Schorst, a Jew who was a member of the Mizraim Lodge, stole th e document and sold it for 2,500 francs to Justine Glinka, the daughter of a Russian General. She in turn gave the French document, and a Russian translation to Gen. Orgevskii in St. Petersburg, who gave it to his superior, Gen. Cherevin, who filed i t. Glinka was later arrested, returned to Russia, and exiled to her estate in Orel; while Sch orst was killed in Egypt. It had also been reported that Glinka had given a copy to Alexi s Sukhotin, a law enforcement official in Orel, who then showed them to two frien ds, Stepanov, and Professor Sergei Nilus, a religious mystic. "},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":" Sergei Nilus Nilus showed them to the Czar in 1903, who believed them to be fraudulent, and ordered that all copies were to be destroyed. After Nilus was banned from the Court, it is believed that he may have altered the text to be more intense then they originally were. However, as far as the mysterious references to the “representatives of Sion, of the 33rd degree,” he would not have any idea what t his meant, and probably would not have altered this and any other in)kind references. The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion first appeared, in a shortened form, in an August, 1903 edition of the Kishinev newspaper, in the Ukraine; then in 1905, in the appendix of the third edition of a book by Nilus ca lled The Great in the Small , which was about the coming of the Antichrist. Nilus said that the Protocols were translated from the French text of a speech made to 300 influential Jew s. A prostitute allegedly stole the document from a leading Jew. A copy was received by the British Museum in London, in August, 1906, where it was translated by English jo urnalist Victor Marsden, who published it in 1921. Marsden said that he couldn’t work on the translation for more than an hour at a time, because of the evil he felt whil e reading it. In 1917, Nilus revised and expanded his book, which he called, He is Near, At the Door: Here Comes the Antichrist and the Reign of the Devil on Earth . Nilus wrote: “These Protocols are nothing else th an a strategic plan for the conquest of the world ... presented to the Council of the Elders by ... Theodor Herzl, at the time of the first Zion ist Congress (held by the World Zionist Organization in 1897, at Basel, Switzerland).” Howe ver, in his 1905 edition, he said that the Protocols had been given in 1902)03. In fact, w ith each subsequent edition that appeared in different countries, the origin of the document was different. "},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":" Theodor Herzl On August 16, 17, and 18, 1921, the New York Times ran editorials by Phillip Graves, a London Times correspondent, who said that the Protocols had bee n copied from a rare 1864 French political satire called Dialogues in Hell Between Machiavelli and Montesquieu (also referred to as the Dialogues of Geneva by the London Times because Geneva had been identified as a center of r evolutionary activities) by lawyer Maurice Joly (1831)1878). It was a pamphlet contain ing a conversation between Montesquieu (presenting a case for liberalism) and Machiavelli (who represented autocracy) which criticized the government of Napol eon III (who was deposed in 1871). Being illegal to criticize the Monarchy, he fiction alized it, making Napoleon the character of Machiavelli, to explain the Emperor’s underlying motives. Joly had it printed in Belgium, then attempted to have it smuggled over th e French border. It was seized by the police, who confiscated as many copies as they could, then banned the book. The police traced the book to Joly, who was then tried on April 25, 1865, and sentenced to fifteen months in prison. At the Berne trials, a wi tness for the prosecution tried to prove that Joly was a Jew, and that his book was a coded version of the Jewish plan for world domination. Another writer, Victor Hugo (1802)1885) , a Grand Master of the Prieuré de Sion (1844)1885) who in 1849 made a reference to th e ‘United States of Europe,’ wrote satirical poetry against Napoleon III. "},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"   Vic tor Hugo  Napoleon I II As it turns out, over 160 passages from the Protoco ls are similar to Joly’s book, which is about half the text. Some sections are alm ost word for word. The only major change is that it was altered from the past, to the future. Some researchers believe that either, Joly was give n the minutes to a Masonic meeting by Adolphe Cremieux (a Mason and Rosicrucia n), who urged Joly to write the book, which he did under the pseudonym of “Mr. X”; or that the minutes were from a Marxist meeting which took place in a Masonic lodge in Geneva, and had been stored in the archives of the Mizraim Masonic Lodge in Paris, where Cremieux, who sat on the Supreme Council, discovered them. Adolphe Cremieux Who could have forged the Protocols isn’t known, if in fact it is a forgery. Some researchers claim it was done in Russia, in 1904, b y agents of the Czar. However, the general consensus is that it was probably done by E lie de Cyon (Ilya Tsion), a Russian journalist living in Paris, who was an opponent of Sergey Witte, the Russian Minister of Finance. "},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":" Sergey Witte When Witte took office in 1892, he began to moderni ze Russia by doubling steel, iron, and coal production; and constructing railroa ds. He was disliked by those who had their money tied up in agriculture. He caused infla tion by abandoning the gold standard in 1898 because of an economic slump. The Protocols say that such economic depressions are caused by the Elders to gain contro l of the money; and that the gold standard has ruined every country that has adopted it. Researchers say that the economic and financial data could have been extract ed from Joly’s book, and applied to Witte, in order to present him as a tool of the Eld ers of Zion. So, Cyon allegedly forged and translated the Protoc ols, expanding them as a satire on Witte. His writings resembled the style used in the Protocols; and he was known to have used another French satire on a dead statesman , by changing the names. In 1897, Gen. Pyotr Ivanovich Rachkovsky, head of the Russian Secret Police in Paris, on instructions from Witte, broke into Cyon’s villa at Territet, Switzerland, to look for additional written attacks on Witte. It is believed that Rachkovsky discovered the Protocols there, and used it for a dual purpose. He could use it against the Jews, claiming it was part of a Jewish conspiracy; and he could reveal that it was written by a Jew, which Cyon was, thus destroying Cyon. It was k ind of ironic, that the Russian translation for Cyon’s name, ‘Tsion’, means ‘Zion.’ In 1921, Count Alexandru du Chayla said that Nilus revealed to him in 1909 that the Protocols were fraudulent, and had been sent to him by Gen. Rachkovsky. During the 1934 trial of two Swiss Nazis in Berne, brought by a group of Jews who accused them of distributing the Protocols, the his torian Vladimir Burtsev and a professor, Sergey Svatikov, testified that Rachkovs ky and other Czarist officials had a hand in the fabrication of the Protocols. In 1891, Rachkovsky sent a letter to the Police, and announced his intentions to oppose the Jews. Th is was followed up by a book that stated his views about the Jews, and how, as a resu lt of the French Revolution, they controlled Europe. It is quite possible that he add ed to Cyon’s manuscript to produce the Protocols, and then gave it to Sergei Nilus to publish in his book. Czar Nicholas II even identified the Protocols as being fraudulent. On May 14, 1935, the Court of Berne ruled that the Protocols were not of Jewish origin. "},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":" Czar Nicholas II To complicate matters even more, a book by Jacob Ve nedey, called Machiavelli: Montesquieu and Rousseau , which was published in Berlin, in 1850, also cont ained passages very similar to the Protocols. Standard Oil allegedly had the Protocols distribute d in Russia to create a tense situation between the Czarist Russian government, a nd the Jewish)owned Royal Dutch Co., who had oil distribution rights in Russia. The document was also used in the late 1800’s to instigate pogroms against the Jews so the y would migrate to the United States. Once they were in America, they were regist ered to vote Democratic, and greatly contributed to Wilson’s election in 1912. D uring the Russian Civil War from 1918)20, Bolsheviks distributed the Protocols, and in the subsequent pogroms, over 100,000 Jews were killed. During World War II, the document gave Hitler an excuse to exterminate the Jews, and there is evidence which i ndicates that he was financed and controlled by the I Iluminati. Eventually the Protocols were distributed all over the world, and it gave the anti) Semitic people of various countries an excuse to pe rsecute the Jews. In 1920, U.S. industrialist Henry Ford supported them in a series of articles in his newspaper The Dearborn Independent and eventually in his book The International Jew , which he published in 1921. On February 17, 1921, in New York World , Ford said: “The only statement I care to make about the Protocols is tha t they fit in with what is going on. They are sixteen years old, and they have fitted th e world situation up to this time. They fit it now.” The German translation was known as The Eternal Jew . Ford supported Hitler, who was seen as fighting against the intern ational Jewish conspiracy. In 1927, he renounced his belief in them after his car was side swiped, forcing it over a steep embankment. He interpreted this as an attempt on hi s life by elitist Jews. "},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"   Henry Ford  Charles E. C oughlin In 1938, Father Charles E. Coughlin printed them in his weekly paper Social Justice , and various other semi)religious organizations foll owed suit. Those researchers who believe in the authenticity o f the Protocols, trace them back to 1785, when the I Iluminati courier was struck by lightning on the wa y to Paris, and their plans for world control was discovered. The I Iluminati had drafted a master plan that was worded in such a way, that it diverted att ention away from the I Iluminati, and directed it towards the Jewish Revolutionary moveme nt in Russia. Their plan would appear to be a Jewish plot to achieve world control through political Zionism, when in fact it represented the future plans of the interna tional bankers of the I Iluminati. The fact that the document was anti)Semitic, would help supp ress it. One inescapable fact is that the Protocols do refle ct some of the views of Weishaupt, and the writings of various Socialists o n Bolshevism; and because of that, they were not easily dismissed. Even though they we re written so long ago, they have become an accurate barometer of events during this century, and seem to parallel the goals of the I Iluminati, as you can see in these excerpts from th e Victor Marsden translation: “Out of the temporary evil we are now compelled to commit, will emerge the good of an unshakable rule, which will restore the regul ar course of the machinery of the national life, brought to naught by liberalism. The result justifies the means. Let us, however, in our plans, direct our attention not to what is good and moral, as to what is necessary and useful. Our power in th e present tottering condition of all forms of power will be more invisible than a ny other, because it will remain invisible until the moment when it has gained such strength that no cunning can any longer undermine it.

The a dministrators, whom we shall choose from among the public, with strict regard to their capacities for servile obedience, will not be persons trained in the art o f government, and will therefore easily become pawns in our game in the hands of men of learning and genius who will be their advisors, specialists bred and re ared from early childhood to rule the affairs of the whole world.” “Do not suppose for a moment that those statements are empty words: think carefully of the successes we arranged for Darwinis m, Marxism, Nietzcheism. To us, at any rate, it should be plain to see what a d isintegrating importance these directives have had upon the minds of the goyim (a slur against those who were not Jewish).” “Through the Press we have gained the power to infl uence while remaining ourselves in the shade; thanks to the Press we have got the gold in our hands, notwithstanding that we have had to gather it out o f the oceans of blood and tears.” “To this end we have stirred up every form of enter prise, we have armed all parties, we have set up authority as a target for e very ambition ... disorders and bankruptcy will be universal.” “We appear on the scene as alleged saviors of the w orker from this oppression when we propose to him to enter the ranks of our fi ghting forces– Socialists, Anarchists, Communists– to whom we will always give support.” “Our power is in the chronic shortness of food ...

Seemingly, the Protocols do elaborate on the I Iluminati program for world takeover that would not have pertained to the world at the time the Protoco ls were alleged to have been written. Because of the depth of information given on the va rious aspects of the plan, I believe that they were written by, or based on the writings of someone who had an intimate knowledge of the future plans and inner workings of the international bankers. From that standpoint, I consider the information to be authen tic. However, because the document identifies the Jews as being responsible for carryi ng out this insidious plot, I consider the Protocols as a whole, to be a fraudulent render ing of an earlier document, which has since been lost. A few years ago, another theory came to light in re gard to the Protocols. If the document was forged with the intent of being an ind ictment against all Jews, it would not just pinpoint a small group of individuals. It speaks of a “King of the blood of Sion” who will preside over a “Masonic kingdom” and that this king will be of “the dynastic roots of King David.” It claims that the “King of t he Jews will be the real Pope” and “the patriarch of an international church.”"},{"pageNumber":362,"pageContent":"Eliphas Levi (Alphonse Louis Constant), who had joi ned a Martinist)affiliated Masonic lodge, which later merged with the Memphis and Mizraim Lodges, had assisted Charles Nodier (Grandmaster of the Prieuré de Sion 1801)1844) to sift through the Vatican documents taken by Napoleon. Before he died in 1875, he said that “in 1879 a new political and religious ‘universal Kingdom’ wou ld be established, and that it would be possessed by ‘him who would have the keys of the East’.” This unusual comment has lead researchers to believe that he had access to the original Protocol document which was kept at the Mizraim Lodge.   Eliphas Levi  Charles Nod ier Protocol number 3 states: “When the hour strikes fo r our Sovereign Lord of all the World to be crowned it is these hands which will sw eep away everything that might be a hinderance thereto. ‘Ours’ they will not touch, bec ause the moment of the attack will be known to us and we shall take measures to protect o ur own. Ever since that time we have been leading the peoples from one disenchantme nt to another, so that in the end they should turn also from us in favor of that King ) Despot of the blood of Sion, whom we are preparing for the world.” Protocol number 15 states: “When the King of Israel sets upon his sacred head the crown offered to him by Europe he will become the p atriarch of the world.” Number 17 says: “The King of the Jews will be the real Pope o f the Universe, the patriarch of an international church.” And number 24 reads: “I pass now to the method of confirming the dynastic roots of King David to the last strata of the earth.

WORLD WAR II AND THE RISE OF HITLER As a youth, Adolf Hitler (1889)1945) fled Austria, and went to Germany to escape"},{"pageNumber":363,"pageContent":"the draft. He was arrested, and in February, 1914, a report was put in his file, which read in part: “Unfit for military or auxiliary serv ice; too weak; incapable of bearing arms.” This was the man that the I Iluminati would choose to further their goals. As a puppet of the I Iluminati, he was used to set the stage for the con flict which would eventually lead to the establishment of the United Nations, a major step towards one)world government; and to shame the world into allowing the State of I srael to be established. Adolf Hitler Edward George Bulwer)Lytton (1803)73), a graduate o f Cambridge University, and a Mason, who became a member of the British Parliamen t, wrote a novel in 1871 called Vril: The Power of the Coming Race , about a super)race of white Aryans that took control of the world. Researchers consider him resp onsible for the birth of the Nazi movement, because Hitler was said to have been infl uenced by this book, and another novel, Rienzi: The Last of the Roman Tribunes , which was adapted into a major opera by German composer Richard Wagner. After seeing Rienzi for the first time in November, 1906, Hitler talked about a “mandate whic h, one day, he would receive from the people, to lead them out of servitude to the he ights of freedom.” He believed that he would be entrusted with a special mission. He later told Frau Wagner, the composer’s widow: “In that hour it began (the Nazi movement k nown as National Socialism).”  Edward George B ulwer)Lytton Richard Wagner"},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":"History shows that Hitler ordered the death of six million Jews during the Holocaust in Europe. Why he did, has become a mystery, since it really hasn’t been established that he had an intense hatred for Jews. A U.S. Office of Strategic Services psychological r eport by Walter C. Langer, later published as The Mind of Adolf Hitler , says that the young Hitler was befriended by Jewish art dealers who “paid generously for his med iocre watercolors.” Because of his financial situation, a Jewish landlady charged him only a nominal rent, and even moved out of her apartment on one occasion so that Hitler and a friend could have more room. A Jewish used)clothing dealer gave him a long black overcoat, which he wore constantly. When he was a lance)corporal during Wor ld War I, Hitler was awarded the Iron Cross (First and Second Class), a rare honor f or a soldier of such low rank, who hadn’t really done anything to deserve such a disti nction. He learned later, that the commendation was the result of the “efforts of the regimental adjutant, Hugo Gutmann, a Jew.” When he became Fuhrer, Hitler hired a Jewish maid t o do his cooking. On one occasion, when it was suggested that he get rid of her, he became furious. Dr. Eduard Bloch, a Jewish physician, had been the Hitler fami ly doctor since Hitler was a child. Bloch had treated Hitler’s mother when she was dyin g of cancer. After her funeral, Hitler accompanied his sisters to thank him, and said: “I shall be grateful to you forever.” He sent the doctor two postcards, one that he handpain ted. Both of them said: “From your ever grateful patient, Adolf Hitler.” Hitler had even wondered if he himself was Jewish. This idea stemmed from the fact that Hitler’s father, Alois, was illegitimate, and the identity of his grandfather had never been established. During Hitler’s rise to power, hi s half)brother’s son threatened to reveal that Hitler was of Jewish ancestry. One inve stigation discovered that Hitler’s grandfather had been the son of a Jewish family cal led Frankenburger, in Gratz, who employed Hitler’s grandmother, Maria Anna Schicklgr uber, as a maid. She had become pregnant by their son, while she was working in the ir home. The family sent her money for a year and a half to help support the child. An other investigation said that Alois was conceived in Vienna, where Hitler’s grandfather was employed as a servant in the home of Baron Rothschild. Maria was sent home to Spital, where Hitler’s father was born. In Hitler’s War , written in 1977 by British author and historical revisionist, David Irving, he revealed that Hitler didn’t order the Je wish massacres, and didn’t find out about it until late in the war. There is no record of Hitler ever visiting a concentration camp, although he did watch films and see photograp hs. "},{"pageNumber":365,"pageContent":" David Irving So what turned Hitler against the Jews, if indeed h e was; or was there someone else making decisions for him. As early as 1919, he spoke of removing Jews altoget her; and in his book Mein Kampf , written while he was in prison in 1924, for the ‘Beer Hall Putsch,’ spoke of the overthrow of “world Jewry”: “I believe that I am to day acting according to the purposes of the almighty Creator. In resisting the Jew, I am fighting the Lord’s battle.” On January 30, 1939, he said in a speech to the Reichstag: “To day I want to be a prophet once more: if international finance Jewry inside and out side of Europe should succeed once more in plunging nations into another world war, th e consequence will not be the bolshevization of the earth and thereby the victory of Jewry, but the annihilation of the Jewish race in Europe.” In a public speech in Munic h, on November 8, 1942, he said that “International Jewry will be recognized in its full demonic peril; we National Socialists would see to that.” Hitler had read the Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion , and in 1942, was told by Himmler, that they were forged, however, Hitler dis regarded that fact and said: “We shall regain our health only by eliminating the Jew .” He attributed the weakness of the German economy to the Jews, and considered the Trea ty of Versailles, a Jewish document. He even accused the Jews of spreading com munism; yet in a speech on February 5, 1941, said that “basically, National So cialism (Naziism) and Communism are the same.” "},{"pageNumber":366,"pageContent":" Heinrich Himmler Why does the life of Hitler seem to be a series of contradictions? One clue was revealed in The Secret Diaries of Hitler’s Doctors , written in 1983 by David Irving, which revealed that Hitler had taken 75 different medicat ions. He was given strychnine and belladonna (for gas), cocaine and adrenalin (for co njunctivitis), amphetamines, painkillers, and sedatives, including Eukodal, a sy nthetic morphine derivative. One has to wonder if Hitler was even aware of what he was b eing given. Were they being given to him for the sole purpose of making him mentally unstable, so he could be controlled by advisors, who were acting on behalf of the force s that Hitler wrongly identified as the Jewish bankers. There may also be a more sinister reason which cont ributed to Hitler’s state of mind. Hitler and some of his officers had been linked to various occult groups and the use of the swastika gave evidence of that. In its normal u sage, it is a sign of the power of light; but in its reverse form, as used by the Nazis, it r epresents the power of darkness. According to writer Joseph Carr: “We know that Hitl er and his top luminaries were either dabblers in the occult, or, outright Satanists.” As a youth, Hitler had been influenced by George Lanz von Liebenfels, an Austrian magician wh o in 1907 founded “The Order of the New Templars,” which used the swastika as its e mblem. He wrote in a 1932 letter that Hitler was one of his pupils and that one day he would “develop a movement that will make the world tremble.” Hitler joined a secret group in 1919, called the Th ule Society, which practiced black magic and worshipped Satan. They wanted to form a p olitical party to rally the people against communism. Its members were drawn from the upper echelon of Society. The founder, Dietrich Eckart, was one of the seven foun ding members of the Nazi Party, and said on his deathbed: “Follow Hitler. He will dance , but it is I who have called the tune! I have initiated him into the ‘Secret Doctrine,’ open ed his centres in vision and given him the means to communicate with the Powers. Do not mo urn for me: I shall have influenced history more than any other German.” Hit ler grew to fear those around him who practiced the black arts, and it was discovered that along with the Jews, Masons and occult practitioners were also killed and impri soned in the concentration camps. Some of the reported book burnings were actually th e confiscation and destruction of Masonic libraries.

Hitler was also influenced b y the writings of Friedrich Nietzsche, from whose name came the word Nazi. In 1943, Hitler ’s birthday gift to Mussolini, was The Collected Works of Nietzche . Friedrich Nietzsche In the fall of 1919, Hitler joined the German Worke rs’ Party, and soon became one of its leaders. In the summer of 1920, it was renamed the National Socialist German Workers’ Party, and then in 1923, it became known a s the Nazi Party. Because of Hitler’s failed November revolt, he was jailed on April 1, 1924 , sentenced to five years, but was released after eight months, so he could be built up to national prominence. Though Mein Kampf was published as a work of Adolf Hitler while he w as in prison, it was discovered later that it was actu ally written by Nazi politicians Rudolf Hess and Hermann Wilhelm Goering (and possibly Haus hofer), as a follow)up to the Karl Marx book A World Without Jews . The I Iluminati made sure the book was well circulated, and it became the springboard for Hitle r’s political career.   Rudol ph Hess Hermann Wilhelm Goering In 1925, Dr. Carl Duisberg, I. G.

Carl Duisberg Since 1924, the Dawes Plan flooded Germany with a tremendous am ount of American capital, which enabled Germany to build it s war machine. The three largest loans went into the development of industries, such as I. G. Farben Co. (the German company which became the largest corporation in Eur ope, and the largest chemical company in the world, after a $30 million loan from the Rockefeller’s National City Bank after World War I, and who created a process of mak ing high grade fuel from low quality coals) and Vereinigte Stahlwerke (who produced abou t 95% of Germany’s explosives). In 1939, Standard Oil of New Jersey sold I. G. Farb en $20,000 worth of high quality aviation fuel. I. G. Farben’s assets in the United States were controlled by a holding company called American I. G. Farben Chemical Corp. On the Board of Directors of this corporation was Edsel Ford (President of the Ford M otor Co.), Charles E. Mitchell (President of National City Bank in New York City), Walter C. Teagle (President of Standard Oil of New York), Paul Warburg (Chairman o f the Federal Reserve), and Herman Metz (Director of the Warburg’s Bank of Manh attan). Several Germans on this Board were found guilty of war crimes at Nuremburg. A U.S. War Department investigation revealed that without Farben’s suppor t, “Germany’s prosecution of the war would have been unthinkable and impossible.” "},{"pageNumber":369,"pageContent":"  Edsel Ford  Walter C.

Farben), Ernst Tengelmann (director of the Ruhr coal mining operat ion), Dr. Hjalmar Schacht (prominent banker), and Fritz Thyssen (Chairman of the Board of United Steel Works, Germany’s largest company). Hitler maintained that the Nazi Party would continue “only until the German people had been freed from the thr eat of Marxism and could reach a decision as to whether the final form of government would be a republic or a monarchy.” Thyssen told the Kaiser that Hitler was made Chance llor only as “a transitional stage leading to the reintroduction of the German monarch y.” America’s Ambassador to Germany, William Dodd, repo rted to President Roosevelt in August, 1936: “At the present moment, more than a hundred America n corporations have subsidiaries here or cooperative understandings.

International Telephone and Telegrap h (ITT) held a substantial interest in Focke)Wolfe, an airplane manufacturer who produc ed German fighter aircraft. Prior to World War II, the Round Table organization , through various means, made sure Hitler wasn’t stopped in Austria, the Rhinelan d, or Sudentenland. His financing was done through the Warburg)controlled Mendelsohn Bank of Amsterdam; and the J. Henry Shroeder Bank (financial agent for the Nazi g overnment), which had branches in Frankfurt, London, and New York.

The world turned aga inst him, and his actions instigated World War II, which had actually been planned years before. Another reason for World War II, was to make it pos sible for Russia, our ally at the time, to gain strength and receive recognition as a world power. Although they were our ally, they were still a Communist nation, with grow ing designs on world domination. There is an incredible amount of evidence that indi cates the willingness of our government to allow the spread of Communism, becaus e of the efforts of Communists who had been employed and were acting on behalf of the I Iluminati. In May, 1943 the Allies had pushed the Germans out of Africa, in vading Sicily in June, and in September, pushed their way through It aly, on the way to Southern Germany, their weakest point. However, the U.S. wit hdrew troops from the invasion force so they could be used in a later invasion of France. In his 1950 book Calculated Risk , Gen. Mark Clark said that this decision was “made at high level and for reasons beyond my field and knowledge.” Churchill had wante d the attack to “bring the Central European and Balkan countries under Allied control, before they were allowed to slip into Red slavery.” But instead, under the leadershi p of Gen. Dwight David Eisenhower, the German advance was spread out, which allowed th e Russian forces to advance. Was this an intentional move on the part of the Uni ted States to allow the Russians an opportunity to pursue their ulterior motives. It ce rtainly seems so.  Mark Clark  Winston Churchill Dwight David Eisenhower In the spring of 1943, a faction within the German Secret Service was prepared to assassinate Hitler, and surrender, on one condition – that the Soviets would not be allowed to advance into Central Europe. Roosevelt r efused to accept, and postponed a planned European invasion, in order to give the Rus sians more time to advance, and occupy more land. According to military documents r eleased in 1970, Gen. Eisenhower allowed the Russians to get to Berlin first, before the Americans, which eventually allowed part of the city to fall under Communist co ntrol. Russia was able to come away from 1945 Conference i n Yalta with so much, because Roosevelt believed that the Russians were “ perfectly friendly. They aren’t trying to gobble up the rest of Europe.

Korea, the Kuril Islands, and the northern part of Sakhalin. An American General, Albert C. Wedemeyer, was convi nced that Russia was the only winner of World War II. He said: “Stalin was i ntent on creating favorable conditions for the realization of Communist aims throughout th e Balkans and Western Europe. He emerged as the only winner of the War. We insured t he emergence of a more hostile, menacing predatory power than Nazi Germany, one whi ch has enslaved more people than we liberated.” Gen. George S. Patton wanted to retire because he p lanned on being able to speak his mind about America being “soft on Communism.” H owever, before resigning his Commission, he died after an automobile accident fo rced him to be hospitalized.

However, instead of investigating the a ccusations, they investigated McCarthy, and a wave of anti)McCarthy sentiment swe pt the country.

China had allowed Japan to drill for oil in several provinces, because Standard Oil’s price for kerosene was too high. Through contacts i n the Chinese government, Standard Oil had been able to keep anyone from dril ling, until the Japanese came and developed huge fields. Standard Oil pushed them out , but the Japanese vowed to return, even going as far as saying that they would seize China to recover their oil investments. When the Japanese invaded China in the 1930’s, one of their first acts was to destroy Standard Oil property, because they had bee n responsible for their ouster. In 1931, Henry L. Stimson, the Secretary of State ( a Rockefeller lawyer and agent), met with President Herbert Hoover, on behalf of the I Iluminati, to make a deal. The international bankers promised to end the Depressio n if Hoover would declare war on Japan, and send in the military to protect Standard Oil property. Even though Hoover accommodated the bankers in many cases, this was on e deal that he refused. So Stimson pitched the idea to Governor Franklin De lano Roosevelt (who has a dozen U. S.

After the German ship Bismarck s ank the British ship, known as the Hood, Churchill suggested in April, 1941, “that an American warship should find the Prinz Eugen (the Bismarck’s escort ship) then draw her fire, ‘thus providing the incident for which the United States would be so thankful’ i .e., bring her into war.” While Roosevelt planned for such a provocation in the Atl antic, Hitler told his naval commanders in July, 1941, to avoid confrontation wi th the United States while his Russian campaign was in progress.

The Institute of Pacific Relations, through a $2 million grant, funded communist spies who were to help induce the Japanese to strike back at the United States. Joseph C. Grew Since then, it has become common knowledge that the attack was not the surprise it was claimed to be. On January 27, 1941, Grew sent a telegram to the Secretary of State to report the following: “The Peruvian minist er has informed a member of my staff that he heard from many sources, including a Japane se source, that, in the event of trouble breaking out between the United States and Japan, the Japanese intended to make a surprise attack against Pearl Harbor.” (Sour ce: U.S., Department of State, Publication 1983, Peace and War: United States Foreign Policy, 1931-1 941 , Washington, D.C.: U.S., Government Printing Office, 1943, pp. 617)618) In August, 1941, Congressman Martin Dies, Chairman of the House Committee on Un)American Activities, collected evidence that the Japanese were planning to attack Pearl Harbor. The Committee was in possession of a strategic map, prepared by the Japanese Imperial Military Intelligence Department that clearly indicated their plans to attack Pearl Harbor. Dies was told not to go public with his information. An Army Intelligence officer in the Far East discovered the plan for the Pearl Harbor attack, and prior to the attack, sent three separate messages t o Washington detailing the plan. "},{"pageNumber":383,"pageContent":" Martin Dies Soviet agent Richard Sorge told the Russian Governm ent in October, 1941 that “the Japanese intend to attack Pearl Harbor in the next 60 days,” and received a response from his superiors that the information had been pa ssed onto President Roosevelt. Dusko Popov, a British double agent, received infor mation from Germany about Japan’s plans, and passed the information onto Washington. It was never acted on. As early as 1944, Presidential candidate, New York Governor Thomas E. Dewey, said that Roosevelt knew about the attack on Pearl Harbor, before it happened. In documents declassified by the National Security Age ncy in 1981, America had broken the Blue (diplomatic) and Purple (naval) secret cod es of the Japanese, knew all the details of the attack, and the whereabouts of the J apanese fleet. From September, 1941, until the attack itself, all Japanese communi cations had been intercepted and decoded by American intelligence, and indicated an impending attack on Pearl Harbor. Thomas E. Dewey One transmission, from a fake weather report broadc ast on a Japanese short)wave station contained the words “higashi no kaze ame,” which means “east wind, rain,” which the Americans already knew was the Japanese c ode for war with the United States. Top military officials denied that the “win ds” message existed and attempted to destroy all traces of its receipt. Late in November, 1941, the following order was sen t out to all U.S. military commanders: “The United States desires that Japan c ommit the first overt act.”"},{"pageNumber":384,"pageContent":"According to Secretary of War Stimson, this order c ame directly from Roosevelt. According to Stimson’s diary, 9 people in the war c abinet, all the military people, knew about FDR’s plan of provocation. The State Department knew on November 20th, that a naval force, which in cluded four of the largest Japanese aircraft carriers were heading towards Hawaii, and this information was passed on to Pearl Harbor on Novemb er 27th. However, the American base in Hawaii was not given this information. Thre e days before the attack, Australian Intelligence spotted the Japanese fleet heading for Hawaii. They sent a warning to Washington, but it was dismissed by Roosevelt who s aid it was a politically motivated rumor circulated by the Republicans. On December 1, 1941, the head of the Far East Divis ion of U.S. Naval Intelligence wrote in his report to head of the Pacific Fleet: “ War between the United States and Japan will begin in the nearest future.” The Report never made it to the commander’s desk, because it had been ‘accidentally’ detained b y his superiors. Early in December, Army Intelligence knew that the diplomats at the Ja panese Embassy in Washington had been ordered to destroy all codes, and to return to Japan. Washington also knew that Japan had ordered all of its merchant ships home, b ecause they would be needed to transport soldiers and supplies for the war. On Dec ember 5, Col. Sadtler from U.S. Military Communications transmitted the following t elegram to his superiors, based on information he had received: “War with Japan will b egin immediately; exclude all possibility of a second Port Arthur.” This telegram never got to its destination. In 1932, the U.S. Navy had conducted tests at Pearl Harbor which indicated that it was vulnerable to an attack from sixty miles away w ithout being able to detect it. Admiral J. O. Richardson, Commander)in)Chief of the Pacific fleet, wanted the fleet withdrawn to the west coast of the United States, b ecause they were inadequately manned for war, and because the area was too expose d. It was not done. In January, 1941, Richardson was relieved of his command. It wa s later revealed that Roosevelt wanted him to create a naval blockade around Japan, to provoke them into a response, so the United States could declare war. He refused to do it, saying it was an act of war. Besides knowing about the security weaknesses at th e base in Pearl Harbor, and having previous knowledge about the impending attac k, Roosevelt guaranteed a slaughter by ordering that the planes be grouped in circles, with their propellers facing inward, because he claimed that he wanted to protec t them against ‘acts of sabotage.’ Rear Admiral Robert A. Theobold, USN, Retired, auth or of The Final Secret of Pearl Harbor , and Col. Curtis B. Dall, the son)in)law of FDR, i n an interview with Anthony Hilder for his book Warlords of Washington , admitted that they knew about the Pearl Harbor attack before it occurred. Theobold, the Commander of all the des troyers at Pearl Harbor, said in his book, that Roosevelt knew about the attack 21 hours before it happened. So the result of this positioning of the aircraft, made it difficult for them to get out of the circle, and up in the air, because they didn’t have a reverse gear. Theobold wrote: “An incontestable fact in the true history o f Pearl Harbor is the repeated withholding from Admiral Kimmel and General Walter C. Short (Navy and Army Command in Pearl Harbor) of supremely important mil itary information ... There’s never been a case in history when a commander was not inf ormed that his country will be at war within a few hours and that his forces will mos t likely become the first object of attack at sunrise.”"},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":"   Husband E. K immel  Walter C. Sh ort Theobold also cited the testimony of Admiral Harold Stark (head of Navy Headquarters in Washington) who did not reveal Japa n’s de facto declaration of war to Admiral Kimmel, and said he was acting on orders fr om a “higher authority,” referring to Roosevelt, because Marshall did not outrank Stark. Marshall merely passed on the Roosevelt directive of December 4th, which said tha t no communications could be sent to Pearl Harbor, unless it was cleared by Marshall. On November 26, 1941, Roosevelt had sent an ultimatum, insisting that the Japanese withdraw all their troops. He refused any negotiations with Prince Konoye, the Japanese P rime Minister, even though Joseph Grew (CFR member, and Rockefeller agent), the Ambas sador to Japan, said that such a meeting would prevent war with the Japanese. The Japanese response from Tokyo to the Japanese embassy, encrypted in the “purple code ,” was intercepted by the Navy, decoded, and given to Roosevelt on the evening of D ecember 6th. The thirteen)point communiqué revealed, that because of the intense pr essure of the economic sanctions, diplomatic relations with the United States were be ing terminated at 1:00 PM Eastern time on Sunday, December 7th. For all intents and purposes, this was a declaration of war, and upon reading it, Roosevelt said: “This mea ns war.” It was not passed onto Pearl Harbor command, and it was at that time that the attack began.   Harol d R. Stark Prince Konoye "},{"pageNumber":386,"pageContent":"While FDR was pushing Japan into drawing first bloo d, he told the American public in his famous campaign statement of 1940: “While I am talking to you mothers and fathers, I give you one more assurance. I have said this before, and I shall say it again and again and again: Your boys are not going to be sent into any foreign wars.” Then he said later that he wouldn’t send our boys to war unless we were attacked. Lieutenant Commander Arthur McCollum worked for Nav al Intelligence in Washington and was the communications routing offic er for FDR. All the intercepted Japanese messages would go to McCollum, who would t hen route them to Roosevelt. In October, 1940, he wrote a memo which contained t he basis for FDR’s plan for provoking the Japanese into attacking at Pearl Harb or. It was given to two of Roosevelt’s closest advisors. The memorandum reveal ed his sentiments that it was inevitable that Japan and America were going to war , and that Germany was going to be a threat to America’s security. He said that Ame rican had to go to war, but he also understood that public opinion was against that. So public opinion had to be swayed, and Japan had to be provoked into attacking America . He named eight specific suggestions for things that America should do to ma ke Japan more hostile towards us, ultimately pushing them into attacking us. That wou ld rally the country behind the war effort. Because he was born and raised in Japan, he said that he understood the Japanese mentality, and knew how they would react. This included moving the Pacific fleet to Hawaii, and decimating Japan’s economy wit h an embargo. McCollum said: “If you adopt these policies the Japan will commit an o vert act of war.” Although there is no proof that FDR actually saw this memo, he ended up implementing all eight of McCollum’s points. The Administration discovered that in 1941 a Japane se naval officer was working at the Japanese consulate in Honolulu under an assumed name. They followed him, and began to intercept his messages to Japan, which ena bled the Japanese to develop a timetable for the attack, and even bomb plots. They never stopped him, and it enabled the Japanese to prepare themselves for an attack ag ainst us. Fleet Admiral Halsey wrote: “Our intelligence data spoke of a likely attack by Japan on the Philippines or the Dutch East Indies. Althou gh Pearl Harbor wasn’t excluded from discussion, everything relayed to us pointed to oth er objects of attack. If we had known that the Japanese were continually collecting detai led information about the exact location and movements of our warships in Pearl Har bor (which is made clear by intercepted reports), we naturally would have conce ntrated our efforts on preparations to repel an attack on Pearl Harbor.” "},{"pageNumber":387,"pageContent":"   William F.

Stimson, after meeting wi th the Roosevelt administration on November 25, 1941, wrote in his diary: “The disc ussion was about how we should maneuver to force the Japanese to fire the first sh ot, while not exposing ourselves to too great a danger; this will be a difficult task.” Admiral Husband E. Kimmel wrote in his memoirs: “It was part of Roosevelt’s plan that no warning be sent to the Hawaiian Islands. Ou r leaders in Washington, who deliberately didn’t inform our forces in Pearl Harb or, cannot be justified in any way. The Pearl Harbor Command wasn’t informed at all about . .. the American note of November 26, 1941, delivered to the Japanese ambassador, whi ch practically excluded further negotiations and made war in the Pacific inevitable . The Army and Navy Command in the Hawaiian Islands received not even a hint about intercepted and deciphered Japanese telegrams which were forwarded to concerne d parties in Washington on the 6th and 7th of December, 1941.” The Pacific fleet had consisted of nine battleships , three aircraft cruisers, and some smaller ships. The aircraft carriers, and the small er, more mobile ships, were moved prior to the attack, because Roosevelt knew they wo uld be needed for a war at sea. On November 28th Fleet Admiral William F. Halsey (unde r Kimmel’s command) sailed to Wake Island with the carrier Enterprise, three heav y destroyers and nine small destroyers; and on December 5th, the Lexington, thr ee heavy cruisers and five destroyers were sent to Midway, and the Saratoga we nt to the Pacific Coast. The other battleships were considered dispensable, because th ey had been produced during and prior to World War I, and were viewed as old and ob solete. They were to be sacrificed. On December 7, 1941, the Japanese attacked the U.S. fleet at Pearl Harbor, instead of attacking Russia, as they originally intended to do. The ‘sneak attack’ gave Roosevelt a reason to direct the full force of America’s mili tary might against Japan. The next day, Roosevelt asked Congress to declare war on Japan: “ We don’t like it– and we didn’t want to get in it– but we are in it and we’re going to fight it with everything we’ve got.” On January 1, 1942, the 25 allied nations who went to war against Germany and Japan, signed a “Declaration by the United Nations,” which indicated that no one nation would sign a separate armistice, and Gen. Douglas MacArth ur was appointed as the ‘United Nations Commander of the South Pacific,’ becoming t he Commander)in)Chief of all armed forces in the Pacific Theater."},{"pageNumber":388,"pageContent":" Some scenes of the destruction at Pearl Harbor The attack on Pearl Harbor resulted in the deaths o f 2,341 American soldiers, and 2,233 more were injured or missing. Eighteen ships, including eight battleships, two destroyers, two squadron minesweepers, were sunk or heavily damaged; and 177 planes were destroyed. All of this, just to create an anti)Japanese sentiment in the country, and justify American action against Japan. General George C. Marshall (Supreme Commander of th e U.S. Army), and Admiral Harold R. Stark (Supreme Commander of the U.S. Navy ) in Washington, testified that the message about the attack was not forwarded to K immel and Short because the Hawaiian base had received so many intercepted Japa nese messages that another one would have confused them. In truth, Marshall sat on the information for 15 hours because he didn’t want anything to interfere with a ttack. The message was sent after the attack started.

When the Administration learned of his actions, he was criticized for “complicating the situation.” Eleven days after the attack, the Roberts Commissio n, headed by Supreme Court Justice Owen Roberts, made scapegoats of Kimmel and Short, who were denied open hearings, publicly ruined, and forced to retire.

With the Japanese prepared to surrender in February, 1945, the war was prolong ed in order to destroy much of the industrial areas of Japan with a devastating air at tack of incendiary atomic bombs. This allowed the ground to be cleared for the I Iluminati to rebuild Japan with new industries so they could use cheap labor to flood the American market with cheaply manufactured goods. This would turn the United States into a nat ion that consumed more than it produced, creating unemployment and financial insta bility. As stated previously, on the European front, the Wa r enabled the Russians to gain control of Eastern Europe, promoted Communism, pave d the way for the United Nations, and the creation of the nation of Israel. At a cost of about $400 billion, the War raised our National Debt to $220 billion, and pushed us deeper into the clutches of the I Iluminati’s international bankers. Because of all the intricate angles involved in this conflict, it would not be an understatement to say that World War II was probably the most costly even t in American history. We may have won, but, in the long run, we lost. "},{"pageNumber":393,"pageContent":"CHAPTER SEVEN THE COMMUNIST AGENDA THE ORIGIN OF COMMUNISM In a previous chapter, we found out how the I Iluminati created Communism to be used as an adversary against liberty. An indication of that fact came from a statement by Dr. Bella Dodd, who was a member of the National Committee of the U.S. Communist Party. She indicated that when their Boar d could not reach a decision, one of their members would go to the Waldorf Towers in New York City to consult with Arthur Goldsmith. Goldsmith’s decision would later be confirmed by Communist officials in Russia. Goldsmith was not a Communist, but was a wealthy ‘capitalist.’ The Communist movement was created out of the roots of Socialism, in fact, President Hoover said: “Socialism is the forerunner of commun ism.”  Herbert Hoover  Plato  Thomas More Socialistic ideas can be traced back to Plato’s (42 7)347 BC) Republic , and English Statesman Sir Thomas More’s (1478)1535) Utopia in 1516. Plato envisioned a society where marriage would be eliminated, all women would belong to all men, and all men would belong to all women. Women would be equal to men, working and fighting wars side by side. All children would be raised by the s tate. There would be a tri)level society consisting of the ruling class, the military class, and the working class. Private property would be eliminated, and the intellectuals would de termine what was best for the lower classes. Indian settlements were communistic. The Pilgrims a nd Virginia colonists tried them, but failed. Captain John Smith of Virginia said: “W hen our people were fed out of the common store, and labored jointly together, glad wa s he who could slip from his labor"},{"pageNumber":394,"pageContent":"and sleep over his task...” John Smith The Mennonites, who came to Pennsylvania from Germa ny, in 1683, established communes. As they moved westward, they left behind a splinter group, called the Amish, who gradually developed a society based on t he private ownership of property. Also in 1683 followers of a Frenchman, Jean de Laba die (former Jesuit, turned Protestant) immigrated to Maryland. They held prope rty in common, but broke up within a couple of years. Jean de Labadie In 1774, Englishwoman Ann Lee, leading a group call ed the Shakers (United Society of Believers in Christ’s Second Appearing), which w as a splinter group of the Quaker movement, established a celibate communal society n ear Albany, New York, in an area known as Watervliet. Religious persecution had forc ed them to America, where they practiced celibacy, equality of sexes, common owner ship of property, and the public confession of sins. In 1787, two of Lee’s followers , Joseph Meacham and Lucy Wright, established a similar colony in New Lebanon, NY. By 1840, they had 6,000 members in 19 communes, from New York, to Indiana and Kentucky . Their numbers declined after the Civil War, and they finally broke up in the 194 0’s. Francois Emile Babeuf (1760)97), was a member of th e I Iluminati (his pseudonym was ‘Gracchus’), and as such, his social views refl ected those of Weishaupt’s. He"},{"pageNumber":395,"pageContent":"formed a Masonic)like association of disciples call ed Babouvistes, who advocated violence as a means of achieving reform. They met a t the dining hall of the Abbey, and sometimes in the crypt. The location of the buildin g, which was near the Pantheon, led to the name of the Order, which was known as the Pa ntheonistes. The group, at its peak, had about 2,000 members. Francois Emile Babeuf Babeuf wrote: “In my system of Common Happiness, I desire that no individual property shall exist. The land is God’s and its fru its belong to all men in general.” One of his disciples, the Marquis de Antonelle, a former m ember of the Revolutionary Tribunal, wrote: “The state of communism is the only just, th e only good one; without this state of things, no peaceful and really happy societies can exist.” In April, 1796, Babeuf wrote his Manifesto of the Equals , which was published under the title Analysis of the Doctrine of Babeuf . In it he wrote: “No more private property in land, the land belongs to no one ... the fruits of the earth belong to everyone ... Vanish at last, revolt ing distinctions of rich and poor, of great and small, of masters and servants, of gov ernors and governed. Let there be no difference between men than that of age and sex. Since all have the same needs and the same faculties, let there be onl y one education, one kind of food. They content themselves with one sun and air for all; why should not the same portion and the same quality of food suffice f or each of them...” Under his plan, workers wouldn’t be paid in money, since the owning of personal property would be abolished. Instead, payment would be made through the distribution of products. These products, stored in communal war ehouses, would be equally handed out. Another notable aspect of his plan was that ch ildren would not be allowed to bear the name of their father, unless he was a man of gr eat importance. Knowing that people would never allow such a commun istic system, they never fully revealed their plans. Instead, their propaganda cen tered on “equality among men” and “justice of the people,” while they criticized the “greed” of the government. The working men didn’t fully understand Babeuf’s doctrines, nev ertheless, they praised his ideas. In August, 1796, Babeuf and 45 leaders of his movem ent were arrested after the government found out they were making preparations to lead a revolt of the people against them. They were put on trial in a proceedin g that lasted from February to May, 1797. The I Iluminati was secretly directing the Babouviste mov ement, and Babeuf testified that he was just an agent of the conspira cy: “I attest they do for me too much"},{"pageNumber":396,"pageContent":"honor in decorating me with the title of head of th is affair. I declare that I had only a secondary and limited part in it ... The heads and the leaders needed a director of public opinion. I was in the position to enlist this opini on.” On May 28, 1797, Babeuf was hung, and many of his followers were deported. Those who have studied the Russian Revolution have observed that there is little difference between Babouvism and Bolshevism. The Th ird Internationale of Moscow in 1919, in its first Manifesto, traced its descent fr om Babeuf. The Russian Revolution may have been the ultimate goal of Babeuf, who wrote: “ The French Revolution is only the forerunner of another revolution, very much greater , very much more solemn, and which will be the last!” The earliest advocate of the movement, later to be known as Socialism, was the English mill owner Robert Owen (1771)1858). He was a student of spiritualism and published his views in the Rational Quarterly Review . At his Scotland textile factory, he was known as a model employer because of the reform s he instituted, even enacting child labor laws. He felt production could be incre ased if competition was eliminated. Many of his principles were derived from the writin gs of Weishaupt. For instance, Weishaupt wrote that the aim of the I Iluminati, was “to make the human race, without any distinction of nation, condition or profession, one good and happy family.” Owen said that the “new state of existence upon the eart h, which, when understood and applied rationally to practice, will cordially unit e all as one good and enlightened family.” Many of Owen’s philosophies were parallel to those of the I Iluminati. Robert Owen Owen’s long term goal was to “cut the world into vi llages of 300 to 2,000 souls,” in which, “the dwellings for the 200 or 300 families s hould be placed together in the form of a parallelogram.” According to his philosophy, “ind ividualism was to be disallowed,” and “each was to work for the benefit of all.” A colony established along those lines in Ireland failed, so in 1824, Owen sailed to America, where he bought several thousand acres from George Rapp’s pietistic Harmony Society, in Posey County, Indiana. In 1825, with 1,000 settlers, he started his “New Harm ony Community of Equality.” It was a model town of non) profit making stores. Other settlements like this were started in America and Scotland, and communism was born. However, Owen was a weak leader, had few skilled workmen, and had to put additional duties on the few competent workers that he had, in an attempt to insure success. In 1826, he adopted a Constitution that co ndemned private property and"},{"pageNumber":397,"pageContent":"organized religion. However, Owen had failed to take into account human nature, something he had fought so hard for in earlier years, when he advoca ted better housing for workers, better education for children, and the elimination of unhe althy living conditions. Even though he failed in an attempt to merge all the trade unio ns into a “Great Trades Union,” his reforms completely transformed the town of New Lana rk, Scotland. In 1827, Owen resigned as manager, and dissolved the colony, beca use he was forced to change his thinking. He wrote: “No societies with common prope rty and equality could prosper. In order to succeed it was needful to exclude the inte mperate, the idle, the careless, the quarrelsome, the avaricious, the selfish...” His son, Robert Dale Owen (1801)77), was a leader i n the Workingman’s Party in 1829, which evolved down through the years into the U.S. Communist Party. Robert Dale Owen In 1817, a group of German separatists, led by Jose ph M. Bimeler, settled near the Tuscarawas River in Ohio, naming their society afte r one of the few Biblical plain cities that escaped the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. In 1819, they were incorporated as the Society of Separatists of Zoar. All property was held in common; factories and shops were managed by an elected Board of Trustees. They prospered during the 1850’s, establishing the town of Zoar, having over 10,000 acres, and $1 million worth of assets. After Bimeler’s death in 1853, interest dec lined, and the town dissolved in 1898. There were other communistic settlements, such as H armony, PA (1805); Nashoba, Tennessee (1825); the Cooperative Store at Toad Str eet (1844); and the Cooperative Society of Oldham (1850), set up by the Rochdale Pi oneers, which also failed. Some groups today can trace their roots to the 19th century communes. In the 1830’s, Joseph Smith, who founded the Church of Jes us Christ of the Latter Day Saints (the Mormons), moved his followers from New York, t o Ohio, then to Missouri, and finally to Utah, because of religious persecution. He believed that a form of communal Christianity existed during the time of the Apostle s. "},{"pageNumber":398,"pageContent":" Joseph Smith John Humphrey Noyes (“Father Noyes”), after establi shing a colony at Putney, Virginia, in 1846, set up another in Oneida, New Yo rk, in 1848, which featured common property ownership and child rearing, selective ‘br eeding’ of babies, and a society in which every woman was considered to be the wife of each man, and every man the husband of each woman. By 1874, there were 300 memb ers. Noyes went to Canada in 1879 after threats of prosecution, and the colony d iscontinued their unusual sexual practices. They reorganized as a joint stock compan y, which is still operating today. John Humphrey Noyes Christian Metz, head of the 17th century German Pro testant sect known as the Community of True Inspiration, settled on a farm ne ar Buffalo, New York, in 1842, where they established a Christian commune where al l property was commonly owned. Work and worship was combined. In 1855, they moved to an 18,000 acre area in Iowa, forming the community of Amana. It eventually expan ded into seven villages, with farms, stores, sheds and factories. The commune sti ll exists today, with its factories producing various appliances. Its stock was held by about 1400 members. Comte Henri de Saint)Simon (1776)1825), French nobl eman, philosopher and socialist, was the grandson of the author of King L ouis XIV’s memoirs. He was considered by some to be mentally unbalanced, becau se of an infliction inherited from his insane mother. Others believed him to be a geni us. His philosophy, known as the “New Christianity,” advocated the placing of all pr operty and people under the State’s control, to insure that the exploitation of the poo r would end. He declared that the existing social system was dead and should be done away with. He called for the"},{"pageNumber":399,"pageContent":"merging of scientific and technological knowledge t owards industrialism, in order to have the elite rule. He said that all men were not created equal. His followers, known as “The Family” instituted a political program, callin g for the public control of industrial production, abolition of inheritance, and equal rig hts for women. They even tried to start a Saint)Simonian Church. Comte Henri de Saint)Simon In 1836, one of Simon’s disciples, Philippe Joseph Benjamin Buchez, attempted to combine Socialism with Catholicism, with something called Christian Socialism. This was a continuation of Weishaupt’s efforts to identi fy Christianity with the I Iluminati, in order to draw members. Peaceful revolution was to b e carried out through the principles of Christian love and brotherhood, with Jesus being represented as a Socialist. The group published a labor newspaper called L ́Atelier (“ The Workshop ”), which was written and edited by the workers themselves. They warned against the use of violence to obtain social change, and barred the workers fro m belonging to secret organizations. Small co)op communities were established. They star ted the Council for Promoting Working Men’s Associations, and in 1854, started th e Working Men’s College in London. As Christian Socialism developed, it was promoted b y saying that Socialism was the ultimate goal of Christianity. In America, prominen t Protestant clergymen, such as Washington Gladden, Walter Rauschenbusch, Lyman Abb ott, Josiah Strong, and Charles M. Sheldon, through sermons, books, magazin e and newspaper articles, called for better working conditions for women, the elimin ation of child labor, a six)day work week, and a decent working wage. These principles w ere later adopted by the Federal Council of Churches of Christ in America in 1908. T he aforementioned ministers, and economist Richard T. Ely, in 1889, organized the So ciety of Christian Socialists, which advocated a cooperative society based on the teachi ngs of Christ. Rev.

He said that capitalism was unstable and would be replaced by cooperative institutions. Louis)Auguste Blanqui Etienne Cabet, the son of a barrelmaker, went to En gland in 1834, where he became a convert of Robert Owen. When he returned t o France in 1839, he laid out a plan for a communistic settlement, which he establi shed in the Red River region of Texas in 1847 . His 69 followers were called “Icarians,” after his 1840 novel Voyage en Icaria , which portrayed a society where all property was held in common, and products of the community were distributed according to need . Later that year, he wrote a book on the French Revolution, and traced the course of communistic theories starting with Plato, Pythagoras (a 6th century BC philosopher), t he Essenes of Judea, More, CampaneIla, Locke, Montesquieu, Mably, Rousseau, an d other 18th century philosophers. He claimed that the communists were t he disciples, the imitators, and continuers of the philosophy of Jesus. In 1849, he took 280 of his followers to Nauvoo, Il linois, after the Texas commune failed because of poor soil, crooked land agents, a nd an attack of malaria. This Hancock County area had been a Mormon community of about 15,000 people, who after the death of Joseph Smith in 1844, went to Sa lt Lake City, Utah, with Brigham Young.

Meanwhile, Cabet started a “true Icaria” in Cheltinham, Missouri (near St. Louis), but soon aft er, died of apoplexy. The commune lasted until 1864. Some followers of Cabet also sta rted communes at Corning, Iowa (1860)84), and Cloverdale, California (1881)87). THE RISE OF KARL MARX Heinrich Karl Marx (Moses Mordecai Marx Levy, 1818) 83) was born of wealthy parents (his father was a lawyer), and much of his personal life has never been revealed. Professor M. Mtchedlov, Vice)Director of the Marx Institute, said that there were 100 volumes in his collection, but only thirte en have ever been reprinted for the public. When he was six, his family converted to Ch ristianity, and although he was once a believer in God, after attending the Universities of Bonn and Berlin, Marx wrote that he wanted to avenge himself “against the One who rules above.” He joined the Satanist Church run by Joana Southcott, who was said to be i n contact with the demon Shiloh. His early writings mentioned the name “Oulanem,” wh ich was a ritualistic name for Satan. A friend of Marx wrote in 1841, that “Marx c alls the Christian religion one of the most immoral of religions.” His published attacks a gainst the German government caused him to be ejected from the country. "},{"pageNumber":405,"pageContent":" Karl Marx He received a Doctorate in Philosophy in 1841 , but was turned down for a teaching position, because of his revolutionary activities. In 1843, he studied Economics in Paris, where he learned about French communism. Again he w as expelled for revolutionary activities. In 1844, he wrote the book A World Without Jews even though he was Jewish. In 1845, he moved to Brussels, where, with German philosopher, Friedrich Engels (the son of a wealthy textile manufacturer, 1820)95), who he met in Paris in 1844, they reorganized the Communist League. Friedrich Engels Engels had joined the ‘Young Germany’ group (which had been established by Giuseppe Mazzini) in Switzerland in 1835. He later became a 32nd degree Mason (as did Marx). In 1842 he was sent to England to manage the family’s mill in Manchester. A journalism student, in 1843 he published a treatise on economics called Outlines of a Critique of Political Economy ; and in 1844, wrote a review of Thomas Carlyle’s Past and Present , and also a booklet called The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844 . It was Engel’s philosophy that established the ba sis for the ideas which were developed by Marx. "},{"pageNumber":406,"pageContent":" In 1848, Marx published his Communist Manifesto (which he was working on from 1830)47), from an Engel’s draft (which was an exten sion of Engel’s Confessions of a Communist ), which also borrowed heavily from Clinton Rooseve lt’s book, The Science of Government Founded on Natural Law which echoed the philosophies of Weishaupt. It had been commissioned by the Communist League in Lo ndon. The League, formerly known as the League of the Just (or the League of J ust Men), which was an off)shoot of the Parisian Outlaws League (which evolved from the Jacobin movement), was founded by I Iluminati members who fled from Germany. The League was made up of rich and powerful men from different countries that were beh ind much of the turmoil that engulfed Europe in 1848. Many researchers consider them either a finger organization of the I Iluminati, or an inner circle. Originally introduce d as the Manifesto of the Communist Party in London, on February 1, 1848, the name was chang ed to the Communist Manifesto , and the name of Karl Marx was added as its author twenty years later, after a series of small revolutions failed. Marx wrote in 1848: “The coming world war will caus e not only reactionary classes and dynasties, but entire reactionary peoples, to d isappear from the face of the earth.” Friedrich Engels, that same year, wrote: “The next world war will make whole reactionary peoples disappear from the face of the earth.” The Manifesto was described by Marxians as “The Cha rter of Freedom of the Workers of the World,” and it was the platform of t he Communist League. It advocated the abolition of property in land, and the applicat ion of all land rent to public purposes; a heavy progressive or graduated income tax; abolitio n of all rights of inheritance; the confiscation of all the property of immigrants and rebels; centralization of credit in the hands of the State with a national bank; centraliza tion and State control of all communication and transportation; expansion of fact ories to cultivate waste lands, and create industrial armies, especially for agricultur e; gradual abolition of the distinction between town and country to have a more equitable d istribution of the population over the country; the elimination of child factory labor and free education for all children in public schools."},{"pageNumber":407,"pageContent":"This revolutionary plan for socialism, which includ ed the abolition of all religion, was reminiscent of the doctrines of Weishaupt. It was b asicaIly a program for establishing a ‘perfect’ state, and it called for the workers (pro letariat) to revolt and overthrow capitalism (the private ownership of industry), and for the government to own all property. Marx, felt, that by controlling all produ ction, the ruling power could politically control a country. After the communist regime would take over, the dictatorship would gradually “wither away” and the result would be a n on)government. The final stage of communism is when the goods are distributed on the basis of need. Leonid Brezhnev, when celebrating the 50th anniversary of the U.S.S. R., said: “Now the Soviet Union is marching onward. The Soviet Union is moving towards communism.” Leonid Brezhnev Meanwhile, Professor Carl Ritter (1779)1859), of th e University of Berlin, a co) founder of modern geographical science, was writing a contrasting view, under the direction of another group of Illuminists. The purp ose of this was to divide the people of the world into opposing camps with differing ideolo gies. The work started by Ritter, was finished after he died, by German philosopher Fried rich Wilhelm Nietzsche (1844)1900), who founded Nietzscheism, which later developed int o Fascism, and then into Nazism, which was later used to ferment World War II. Altho ugh the Nazis, in quoting from Nietzsche, considered themselves to be the Master R ace, Nietzsche did not. Nietzsche tried to stir things up at the top of the social or der, while Marx hammered away at the bottom, concentrating on the lower class and workin g people. Nietzsche wanted to keep the uneducated in a state of slavery, while Marx wa nted to neutralize the elite, and pushed for the rights of the people. "},{"pageNumber":408,"pageContent":"   Carl Ritter Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche Marx worked as a correspondent for the New York Tribune (whose Editor was Horace Greeley, 1852)61), covering the 1848 European revolutions. One source has reported that even these articles were written by E ngels. In 1857 and 1858, Marx wrote a few articles for the New American Cyclopedia . On September 28, 1864, Marx and Engels founded the International Workingmen’s Association at St. Martin’s Hall in London, which c onsisted of English, French, German, Italian, Swiss, and Polish Socialists, who were ded icated to destroying the “prevailing economic system.” It later became known as the Firs t Socialist International, which eight years later spread to New York and merged with the Socialist Party. The statutes they adopted were similar to Mazzini’s, and in fact, a m an named Wolff, the personal secretary of Mazzini, was a member, and pushed Mazz ini’s views. Marx wrote to Engels: “I was present, only as a dumb personage on the platform.” James Guillaume, a Swiss member, wrote: “It is not true that the Inter nationale was the creation of Karl Marx. He remained completely outside the preparator y work that took place from 1862 to 1864...” Again, we find evidence that the I Iluminati did in fact control the growing communist movement, but not to deal with the proble ms of workers and industry, rather it was to instigate riot and revolution.

He was an employee, doing a job for his I Iluminati bosses. Nathan Rothschild had given Marx two checks for sev eral thousand pounds to finance the cause of Socialism. The checks were put on display in the British Museum, after Lord Lionel Walter Rothschild, a trustee, had willed his museum and library to them. Karl Marx In 1867, Marx wrote the first volume of Das Kapital , which became known as the “Bible of the Working Class.” Marx felt, that as th e workers achieved various reforms, there would be a possibility for the peaceful evolu tion towards socialism. A little known fact, is that Marx’ beliefs were gleaned from the w ritings of Weishaupt, Babeuf, Blanc, Cabet, Owen, Ogilvie, Hodgkin, Gray, Robert Thompso n, William Carpenter, and Clinton Roosevelt; which he discovered from his hou rs of research in the Reading Room of the British Museum. The second volume appea red after Marx’ death, edited by Engels from Marx’ notes, in 1885; and volume three appeared in 1894. When Marx died in March 14, 1883, only six people a ttended his funeral. He never supported his family, which had produced six childr en. Three of them died of starvation in infancy and two others committed suicide. Actual ly, Engels supported Marx with income from his father’s cotton mills in England. M arx was buried in London, at Highgate Cemetery. The Social Democratic Party in Germany, in 1869, wa s the first Marxist aligned political Party. They favored an independent workin g class. It grew rapidly, despite the effort of Chancellor Otto von Bismarck to break it up through the enactment of anti) socialist legislation. In 1877, they elected a doze n members to the Reichstag. In 1881, they had 312,000 members; and by 1891, 1,427,000. I n 1891, they eliminated their earlier leanings toward State)aid for co)ops, and a ligned themselves with the Marxist goal of “the abolition of class rule and of classes themselves.” Some of the early Socialist Parties were: Danish So cial Democratic Party (1870’s), Swedish Socialist Party (1889), Norwegian Labor Par ty (1887), Austrian Social Democratic Party (1888), Belgian Labor Party (1885) , Dutch Socialist)Democratic"},{"pageNumber":410,"pageContent":"Workers Party (1894), Spanish Social Labor Party (1 879), Italian Socialist Party (1892), and the Social Democratic Federation of Great Brita in (1880’s).

It was totally organized along Marxist philosophies. LENIN TAKES CONTROL Nikolai Lenin (Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov, 1870)1924) was a Russian revolutionary and student of Marx, who was out for revenge, after his older brother, Alexander, was hung in 1887, along with four comrades, for conspiring t o assassinate Czar Alexander II, the grandfather of Nicholas II. Nikolai Lenin During his teenage years, he admired Mikhail Bakuni n (1814)1876), a follower of Weishaupt’s principles, and a Satanist, who was the driving force behind the initial effort to organize Communism. In 1887, Lenin entered Kazan University, and in 1889, he became a Mason, and soon began advocating the philo sophies of Marx. He said: “We must combat religion. This is the ABC’s of all mate rialism and consequently of Marxism.” In 1891, he passed his law exam. In the e arly 1900’s, he said that socialism could only be achieved by mobilizing workers and pe asants through revolution, since trade unions were not able to bring about any chang e.

The movement was slow to catch on, and by 1907, he only had 17 members, but he would soon have over 40,000. He received financial support from the Fabians, inc luding a $15,000 contribution from Joseph Fels, an American soap manufacturer and a Fabian. George Bernard Shaw, one of the Fabian’s founders, called Lenin, the “greatest Fabian of them all,” and in a speech he made in Mos cow in 1931, said: “It is a real comfort to me, an old man, to be able to step into my grave with the knowledge that the civilization of the world will be saved ... it is h ere in Russia that I have actually been convinced that the new Communist system is capable of leading mankind out of its present crisis, and saving it from complete anarchy and ruin.” George Bernard Shaw Lenin was an advocate of the Populist doctrine, whi ch had been developed by author Aleksandr Herzen during the 1860’s. He felt that the peasant communes could be the socialist society of the future, and called for Russian Socialism to be based on the ancient peasant tradition.

He added two Marxist elements to the Pop ulist theory: the notion of a class struggle, and the need for Russia to pass through a stage of capitalism. He led the people to believe that the purpose of his movement was to help the working class. In America during the 1800’s, an alliance of various f arming groups produced the Populist Party in 1892, which came to be known as the Nation al People’s Party. With their slogan, “The people against the tycoons,” they foug ht for an increase in currency circulation, free silver, labor reform, a graduated income tax, government ownership of the railroads, and the direct election of U.S. Sena tors. By 1896, they were almost fully integrated into the Democratic Party, while their p rinciples were later embraced by the Progressive Party. The Progressive Party was a coalition of socialists , labor leaders and farmers, organized by Republican Senator Robert M.

The name of the country was officially changed to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (U.S.S.R.). Their aims, were to create a single world)wide Communist Party and to o verthrow the “international bougeoisie” by force to create “an international So viet Republic.” From 1916)21, famine swept through Russia (perhaps due to crop tampering), with close to five million dying, because industry was s hut down. On September 21, 1921, American relief services began in Russia, after Pre sident Herbert Hoover received a plea from famous Russian writer Maxim Gorky. The Un ited States appropriated $20 million for the country, with $8 million spent for medical supplies. Over 700,000 tons of goods were sent to feed 18,000,000 people. As it tu rned out, the U.S. was actually supporting the Communist Civil War, which ended in 1922.   Her bert Hoover  Maxim Gorky American and European industrialists rushed to the aid of the Russians. The International Barnsdale Corporation and Standard Oi l got drilling rights; Stuart, James and Cook, Inc. reorganized the coal mines; General Electric sold them electrical equipment; and other major firms like Westinghouse, DuPont and RCA, also aided the Communists. Standard Oil of New Jersey bought 50% o f their huge Caucasus oil fields, and in 1927, built a large refinery in Russia. Stan dard Oil, with their subsidiary, Vacuum Oil Co., made a deal to sell Soviet oil to European countries, and even arranged to get them a $75 million loan. Today, Russia is the world ’s largest petroleum producer, and some researchers believe that the Rockefellers stil l own the oil production facilities in Russia, withdrawing the profits through Switzerland . Rockefeller’s Chase National Bank (later known as C hase Manhattan Bank) helped establish the American)Russian Chamber of Commerce in 1922, and its first President was Reeve Schley, a Chase Vice)President. In 1925, Chase National and PromBank (a German bank) developed a complete program to financ e the Soviets raw material exports to the United States, and imports of U.S. c otton and machinery. Chase National and Equitable Trust Co. were the dominant forces in Soviet credit dealings. In 1928, Chase sold the Bolsheviks bonds in America, and was severely criticized by various patriotic groups who called them “a disgrace to Ame rica.” "},{"pageNumber":421,"pageContent":" Reeve Schley America sent Russia vast quantities of food and oth er relief supplies. Lenin had said that the capitalists would do business with anyone, and when Russia was through with them, the Communists would take over the world. Tha t is what the Russian Communists have been led to believe. In reality, the I Iluminati was completely financing the entire country of Russia, in order to transform them into a world power with principles completely opposite to that of the United States. In May, 1922, Lenin suffered the first of a series of strokes. When he died in 1924, supposedly from syphilis, the country’s leadership was taken over by Joseph Stalin (1879)1953, Iosif Visarionovich Dzhugashvili), afte r a bitter fight with Trotsky. Lenin said on his deathbed: “I committed a great error. My nig htmare is to have the feeling that I’m lost in an ocean of blood from the innumerable vict ims. It is too late to return. To save our country, Russia, we would have needed men like Francis of Assisi. With ten men like him we would have saved Russia.” Trotsky was e xpelled from the Party in 1927, and then exiled from the country in 1929. He attemp ted to mobilize other communist groups against Stalin. Joseph Stalin In 1924, Stalin wrote The Foundations of Leninism , hoping that Lenin would pass the torch of leadership to him. However, in a December, 1922 letter to the Party Congress,"},{"pageNumber":422,"pageContent":"Lenin said of Stalin: “After taking over the positi on of Secretary)General, Comrade Stalin accumulated in his hands immeasurable power and I am not certain whether he will be always able to use this power with the requ ired care.” Lenin wrote in January, 1923: “Stalin is excessively rude, and this defect, which can be freely tolerated in our midst and in contacts among U.S. communists, become s a defect which cannot be tolerated in one holding the position of Secretary) General. Because of this, I propose that the comrades consider the method by which Stal in would be removed from this position and by which another man would be selected for it; a man, who above all, would differ from Stalin, in only one quality, name ly, greater tolerance, greater loyalty, greater kindness, and more considerate attitude tow ard the comrades, a less capricious temper, etc.” Financed by Kuhn, Loeb and Co., Stalin implemented a new economic policy for rapid industrialization, known as the “First Five Y ear Plan.” Even though the U.S. Government was sending over food, Stalin was using the food as a weapon to finish communizing the country. Those who refused to coope rate with the communist government were starved to death. Between 1932)33, it is estimated that between three and seven million people died as a result of Stalin ’s tactics. Stalin later admitted that two)thirds of Russia’s i ndustrial capability was due to the assistance of the United States. Just as Lenin said: “Down with religion! Long live atheism!” Stalin said: “God must be out of Russia in five years.” He eventually did awa y with the “withering away” concept, and developed a fanatical, rigid, and powerful poli ce state. Stalin said that the goals of Communism was to create chaos throughout the world, institute a single world economic system, prod the advanced countries to con sistently give aid to underdeveloped countries, and to divide the world i nto regional groups, which would be a transitional stage to a one)world government. The Communists have not deviated from this blueprint. In 1933, the I Iluminati urged FDR to recognize the country of Rus sia in order to save them from financial ruin, as a number of European c ountries had already done. On November 17, 1933, the U.S. granted diplomatic reco gnition to Russia. In return, Russia promised not to interfere in our internal affairs. A promise they never kept. They became a member of the League of Nations in 1934, but were thrown out in 1939 because of their aggressive actions toward Finland. Meanwhile, the U.S. continued to send them aid. The Cleveland firm of Arthur G. Mackee provided equipment for a huge steel plant at Magnitogorski; John Clader of Detroit, equipped and installed a tractor plant at Chelyabinski; Henry Ford and the Austin Co. provided equipment for an automobile pro duction center at Gorki; and Col. Hugh Cooper, creator of the Mussel Shoals Dam, plan ned and built the giant hydroelectric plant at Dniepostrol. On August 23, 1939, Hitler signed a non)aggression pact with Stalin, and together they attacked Poland in a blitzkrieg war, which led to World War II. Because of a treaty with Poland, France and England were forced to decl are war on Germany. Hitler had said publicly, that he didn’t want war with England , but now was forced into battle with them.

In October, Kiev fell, and Hitler announced there would be a final effort to take Moscow and end the war. On Oct ober 24, with his army 37 miles from Moscow, Hitler planned on waiting until the winter was over before he made his final attack. But then, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, and the U.S. entered the War. Through a lend)lease agreement, America responded b y sending $11 billion in raw materials, machinery, tools, complete industrial pl ants, spare parts, textiles, clothing, canned meat, sugar, flour, weapons, tanks, trucks, aircraft, and gasoline to aid the Russians, which turned the tide against the Germans .

It didn’t happen. For instance, they kept 84 cargo ships, some of which were used to supply North Vietnam with equipment during the V ietnam War. What we sent to the Russians, after the War, became the foundation upon which the Soviet industrial machine was built. Through an agreement negotiated years later by Henry Kissinger, the Russians agreed to pay back $722 million of the $11 billion, which amounted to about 7 cents on the dollar.

In 1943, a Congressional investigation revealed, th at even before the U.S. had built its first atomic bomb, half of all the uranium and technical information needed to construct such a bomb, was secretly sent to Russia. This included chemicals, metals, and minerals instrumental in creating an atomic bom b, and manufacturing a hydrogen bomb. In 1980, James Roosevelt, the son of Presiden t Franklin Roosevelt, wrote a novel, A Family Matter , which detailed how his father made “a bold secret decision– to share the results of the Manhattan Project with the Soviet Union,” in 1943 and 1944.   Jam es Roosevelt Franklin D. Roosevelt Air Force Major Racey Jordan, was a Land)Lease expe diter and liaison officer for the Russians in Great Falls, which was the primary staging area for the massive Lend) Lease supply operation to the Soviet Union. In his diaries, which were published in 1952, he said that the U.S. built the Soviet war ma chine by shipping all the materials needed to construct an atomic pile, including graph ite, cadmium metal, thorium, and uranium. In March, 1943, a number of black leather suitcases wrapped in white window sash cord, and sealed with red wax, said to be of a diplomatic nature, were to be sent to Moscow. One night the Russians had taken them out f or dinner, and suspicious of their friendliness, Jordan decided to sneak away, and wen t back to the base with an armed sentry. He discovered that two Russian couriers fro m Washington had arrived and had procured a plane bound for Russia, to take about 50 of these cases. He detained the flight, and discovered that the shi pment was being sent to the “Director, Institute of Technical and Economic Info rmation” in Moscow. He opened eighteen of the cases, and discovered a collection of maps that identified the names and locations of all the industrial plants in the U .S., along with classified military sites. One case contained a folder of military documents m arked, “from Hiss,” and another case which contained a White House memo from “H.H.” (Harry Hopkins, former Secretary of Commerce and head of the Lend)Lease Pr ogram) to Al Mikoyan (Russia’s number three man, after Stalin and Foreign Commissa r Molotov), which accompanied a map of Oak Ridge and the Manhattan Engineering Dist rict, and a report from Oak"},{"pageNumber":427,"pageContent":"Ridge, which contained phrases like: “energy produc ed by fission,” and “walls five feet thick, of lead and water, to control flying neutron s.” In short, traitors within the Administration of Roo sevelt were giving the Soviets the instructions and the material to build nuclear weap ons, even before the United States had fully developed the technology for use by our c ountry.

Shortly after the Bolshevik revolution ended in 1918, the Communists announced: “We are marching to free ... the people of China.” In 1921, a Russian agent was sent to Peking, then to Shanghai, to make plans for the First Congress of the Chinese Co mmunist Party, which would become the world’s largest.

Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, Harry Dexter White, the Soviet spy, was in charge of making sure China got the money, and over a period of 3 years, he only sent them $27 million. In 1945, Congress voted a second loan of $500 million, and Dexter made sure they didn’t get any o f that, which resulted in the collapse of their economy. After World War II, special envoys Gen.

On July 15, 1971, Chairman Mao appealed to the worl d to, “unite and defeat the U.S. aggressors and all their running dogs.” While campaigning in 1968, Richard Nixon said: “I w ould not recognize Red China now, and I would not agree to admitting it to the U nited Nations.” In his book Six Crises , he said that “admitting Red China to the United Nat ions would be a mockery of the provision of the Charter which limits its membershi p to ‘peace)loving nations.’ And what was most disturbing, was that it would give respect ability to the Communist regime which would immediately increase its power and pres tige in Asia, and probably irreparably weaken the non)Communist governments in that area.” Yet it was Nixon who opened the dialogue with China, and in 1971, Commun ist China was seated as a member country of the United Nations, while the Rep ublic of China (Taiwan) was thrown out.

During the war, it was filled by Russia’s General C onstantine Zinchenko. It was later revealed, that Russian military advisors were actua lly directing the North Korean war effort, and one of those advisors, Lt. Gen. Alexand re Vasiliev, actually gave the order to attack. Vasiliev was the Chairman of the UN Militar y Staff Committee, who along with the Under Secretary for Political and Security Coun cil Affairs, was responsible for all UN military action. Vasliliev had to take a leave of a bsence from his position, to command the communist troops.

The resulting amphibious assault on September 15, 1950, at Inchon Bay, turned the tide of the war by enabling UN forces to recapture Seoul, destroyed la rge supply dumps, and began to push the North Koreans back across the border. In O ctober, they captured the North Korean capital of Pyongyang, and many communists re treated into Manchuria and Russia. The Taiwan government was planning to move against China, and Truman warned Chiang Kai)shek not to make an attempt to recapture his homeland. Truman ordered the American Seventh Fleet into the Strait of Formo sa to prevent any type of invasion. This freed the Red China army to enter the Korean W ar. The Chinese, with the excuse that they were protecting the security of their cou ntry, stormed across the border on November 26, 1950, and stopped the UN army at the Y alu River. Chiang then offered to send an advance force of 33,000 troops into North K orea, but the State Department refused. They were a member of the UN, yet the Unit ed States would not let them fight. The Korean War, Korean Conflict, or Police Action, as it is sometimes called, developed into a stalemate of broken cease)fire agr eements, and MacArthur made plans for a massive retaliation against China. He w anted to bomb the ammunition and fuel dumps, the supply bases, and communication lin es to China (bridges across the Yalu River), and to post a blockade around the Chin ese coast. However, on December 5, 1950, Truman and other Administration officials decided that this sort of action would bring Russia into the conflict, and possibly initia te World War III. MacArthur was ordered not to proceed with any of his plans. The Joint Chi efs of Staff said: “We felt the action urged by Gen.

Still, nothing was done. Gen. Lin Piao, t he Red Chinese commander, said later: “I would never have made the attack and risk ed my men and military reputation if I had not been assured that Washington would restrain General MacArthur from taking adequate retaliatory measures against my lines of s upply and communication.” "},{"pageNumber":436,"pageContent":" Lin Piao With MacArthur insisting that there was no substitu te for victory and that the war against Communism would be either won or lost in Ko rea, he was relieved of his command, on April 11, 1951, by Gen.

George Stratemeyer said: “We had sufficient air bombardment, fighters, reconnaissance so that I cou ld have taken out all those supplies, those airdromes on the other side of the Yalu; I could have bombed the devils between there and Mukden, stopped the railroad oper ating and the people of China that were fighting could not have been supplied ...

Matt Clark told them: “I wa s not allowed to bomb the numerous bridges across the Yalu River over which the enemy constantly poured his trucks, and his munitions, and his killers.” MacArthur would later write: “I was ... worried by a series of directives from W ashington which were greatly decreasing the potential of my air force.

Douglas MacArthur also said: “I am concerned f or the security of our great nation, not so much because of any threat from with out, but because of the insidious forces working from within.” Over 33,000 American lives were lost in a war that they were not allowed to win. Instead, a truce was signed on July 27, 1953. However, the Communists weren’t giving up on Korea. With North Korea being supported by China, Russia and the Eastern Europe c ommunist bloc countries, they built up their military strength, and made enormous economic gains. During the late 1960’s, they began a dialogue for the reunification of Korea, and bilateral talks were held in 1972, which further improved their relation s, as the Communists attempted to take over with diplomacy. A nonaggression pact was signed in December, 1991; and in 2000 a summit meeting was held to explore the possi bility of a reconciliation. As information about communist agents occupying hig h cabinet posts surfaced, the American people took out their frustrations at the polls. Eisenhower’s slogan was: “Let’s clean up the mess in Washington.” He had promised “ peace with honor” in Korea, however, the truce allowed 400 soldiers to remain i n communist prisons. Even though the 1952 Republican Platform called the Truman Plan “ignominious bartering with our enemies,” in reality, Eisenhower’s plan made even m ore concessions. Dwight David Eisenhower Eisenhower’s tough rhetoric on communism ushered in a renewed patriotism in America.

Accor ding to the Congressional Record of August 31, 1960, the U.S. State Department sent the Soviet Union a telegram which read: “The Government of the United States does not look with favor upon governments unfriendly to the Soviet Union on the borders of th e Soviet Union.” Hours after receiving the telegram on November 4, 1956, Khrushchev sent Russian troops back into Hung ary to retake the country.

However, two weeks before, Tito said: “In peace as in war, Yugoslavia must march shoulder to shoulder with the Soviet Union.” On September 17, Tito announced his full support of the Soviet foreign policy.

It was alleged that he made the decision not to provide air support. The invasion failed, because it was not able to lau nch the attack at the alternate site which had an airfield nearby and was more suitable for the unloading of troops and supplies, plus, there were nearby mountains to hide in. Besides the fact that the U.S. didn’t provide the needed air support, it wasn’t ev en a surprise attack, because the New York Times carried an article on January 10, 1961 with this h eadline: “U.S. Helps Train Anti)Castro Force At Secret Guatemalan Air)Ground B ase,” thus, the complete communist domination of Cuba was insured.

According to The Nuclear Deception: Nikita Khrushchev and the Cu ban Missile Crisis (Spook Books, 2002, an imprint of InteliBooks) by Servando González (who was a political officer in the Cuban Army at the time), the presence of missiles in Cuba was never proven. The CIA maintained that there were ne ver nuclear warheads in Cuba, and American planes flying over “missile sites” and Soviet ships had never detected any radiation. In a 1996 article called “Fidel Castro: Supermole,” González said that Cuba had turned into an economic embarrassment. He wrote: “C uba, which was intended to be a showcase of the Soviet model of development in Amer ica, was in fact quickly turning into a showcase of Soviet inefficiency, mainly due to the Cuban leader’s inability (and the) propagation of Fidel’s ‘heretical’ ideas.” Bec ause Castro was perceived as being “unpredictable, volatile, undisciplined,” he was be ing blamed for the Soviet’s failure in Cuba, and Khrushchev decided he had to cut his loss es and withdraw from the country. However, leaving voluntarily would give the impress ion that they were admitting failure, so the scheme was hatched to get rid of Castro “as a result of American aggression.” Initially, an uprising was planned that would have unseated Castro and replaced him with Anibal Escalante, a trusted Party ally. Howeve r, Castro discovered the plan and neutralized it by expelling the ringleader, Soviet ambassador Mikhailovich Kudryavtsev. A frustrated Khrushchev then hit on the idea of pro voking Kennedy to invade Cuba. The idea was that Castro would be overthrown, and when no missiles would be found, the American government would be embarrassed. According to González: “Khrushchev’s carefully conceived plans had not counted on the un expected and apparently irrational behavior of President Kennedy.” González writes: “CFinally, Soviet developments in Cuba were so blat ant and political pressures in the U.S. so strong, that Kennedy was forced to a ct. But, when he announced the blockade of the island, he unexpectedly stated that the American actions were not directed against Cuba, but against the Sov iet Union. Kennedy’s behavior was so surprising that Khrushchev was caug ht completely off balance and panicked before the possibility of a nuclear co nfrontation which he had not anticipated and for which he was not prepared C For tunately for the world, Khrushchev was enough of a political realist to rec ognize when a gambit had been lostCKhrushchev never understood why Kennedy h ad acted in such an irrational and foolish way, by not attacking Cuba a nd, thereby, allowing Castro to stay in power.” On December 2, 1961, Castro proclaimed: “I have bee n a Communist since my teens.” On December 11, 1963, the New York Times printed one of President Kennedy’s last interviews, in which he said: “I thi nk we have spawned, constructed, entirely fabricated without knowing it, the Castro movement.” In 1979, the New York Times published a letter from the former U.S. Ambassador to Cuba, Earl E.

It centered around two issues: the place of Stalin in communist history, and relations with the country of Albania. Khrushchev (1894)1971), the Soviet premier from 1958)64, made verbal attacks on Stalin constantly, and even had his body removed from the mausoleum on Red Square. Mao Tse)tung, and the Chinese Communists went out of th eir way to proclaim their loyalty to the dead leader. When Enver Hoxha, the Communist ru ler of Albania refused to follow Khrushchev’s lead in condemning Stalin, Russia canc eled all economic and technical aid, and recalled all Soviet personnel. China then sent in their own advisors, praising Albania for their stand. Nikita Khrushchev China was upset because Russia failed to support th em during a recent military action, and was suspicious of Khrushchev’s policy o f ‘peaceful coexistence’ with the United States. Since 1961, world communists have sp lit into either pro)Soviet or pro) China factions. China began advocating Maoism, rath er than Marxist)Leninism. Stalin had said: “The object of Soviet Communism is victory of Communism throughout the world ... by peace or war.” Russia b oasted that within a generation, the whole world would be communist. Meanwhile, China al so insisted that war was inevitable. Chou En)lai, the Chinese premier from 1949)76, said publ icly: “The white race constitutes about one)tenth of the world’s pop ulation. Let us completely annihilate the White man. Then we shall be free of him once an d for all.” Because China had their own thoughts of world domin ation, a major rift developed between the two communist giants.

Dipping water out of the ocean in the hollow of each hand, he sprinkled some upon America with his right hand, while with his left he cast some over Europe.

Sharp flashes of lightning gleamed through it at in tervals, and I heard the smothered groans and cries of the American people ( the American Revolution, which was in progress). A second time the angel dipped water from the ocean and sprinkled it out as before. The dark cloud was then drawn back to the o cean, in whose heaving billows it sank from view.

He said: “After sixty years of aggression by the Soviets, only 17% of the remaining world population, lives in what could be termed a free society.” Dimitri Manvilski, a professor at the Lenin School of Political Warfare in Moscow, said in 1930: “War to the hilt between communism an d capitalism is inevitable. Today, of course, we are not strong enough to attack. Our time will come in thirty or forty years. To win, we shall need the element of surprise. The western world will have to be put to sleep. So we shall begin by launching the most spec tacular peace movement on record. There shall be electrifying overtures and unheard o f concessions. The capitalist countries, stupid and decadent, will rejoice to coo perate with their own destruction. They will leap at another chance to be friends. As soon as their guard is down, we shall smash them with our clenched fist.” Lenin said: “First, we will take eastern Europe, th en the masses of Asia, then we will encircle the United States which will be the last b astion of capitalism. We will not have to attack. It will fall into our hands like an over ripe fruit.” William C.

We need thei r credits, their agriculture, and their technology. But we are going to continue massive mi litary programs and by the middle 1980’s we will be in a position to return to a much more aggressive foreign policy designed to gain the upper hand in our relationship with the West.” In a 1973 speech to the Warsaw Pact leaders in Prague, Brezhnev said: “ Trust us, comrades, for by 1985, as a consequence of what we are now achieving with detente, we will have achieved most of our objectives in Western Europe. We will h ave consolidated our position. We will have improved our economy.

It is difficult to do this in Western Europe and America, but it can be done and must be done. Propaganda, agitation and organiz ation inside the armed movements and among the oppressed must be coordinat ed in a new way.” In 1921, he came up with the idea of spreading communism throug h trade unions, youth organizations, cooperatives, and other associations . This idea was taken even further by Otto Kuusinen, a Finland Communist, who at a mee ting of the Comintern Executive Committee in March, 1926, advocated the creation of a “whole solar system of organizations and smaller committees around the Com munist Party ... actually working under the influence of the Party, but not under its mechanical control.” The organizations were developed by Willi Munzenberg, a German communist. Their aim was to further the cause of Soviet communism, and a ct as a cover, if communism was illegal, in order to spread propaganda. Stalin said, during a secret meeting of the Kremlin ’s Inner Circle, in March, 1948: “Comrades, it is imperative that we create an entir ely new type of fighting force. It will operate first in the most advanced capitalist countries, and later in other countries. This fighting force will consist of devo ted and trained comrades who will have no connection with the Communist Party wh atsoever. These comrades will operate undercover, as do our intelligence off icers and spies who are working abroad. This special force will control networks of other undercover comrades, who will also have no outward connection with the C ommunist Party of their country ... The objective of this fighting force is to speed up the development of revolutionary situations and spread awareness of ho w unrest, public disturbance, disorders and industrial dissatisfaction can bring about a breakdown of the capitalist system. This will lead to the revolution ary overthrow of governments, and the establishment of Soviet states.” In another secret meeting in April, 1948, Stalin sa id: “The way to assure success is for us to create not one, but two undercover subverter networks. They will operate simultaneousl y in all the countries of the capitalist world. The undercover subverters of the first network will operate quite independently of the second ...

Inside the Soviet Union, candidates were chosen to attend the Marx)Engels School near Moscow, for what they were told would be train ing for a career within the Party. The recruits would then be sent to the Lenin Techni cal School at Verkhovnoye, which is a complex spread out of over seven square miles in a desolate area. During the time they were here, their family, and friends, did not know their whereabouts. The training lasted 12 months, and consisted of military)like tr aining, such as survival techniques, various methods of hand)to)hand combat, handling fi rearms and heavy combat equipment, how to make and deactivate explosives, m ethods of electronic surveillance, and the use of poisons. If the recruit passed, they would be sent on a vacation, during which they would be arrested by the Secret Police a s a foreign agent. This final test subjected the candidate to brainwashing, torture an d interrogation, to see if they would break under the pressure. If they passed, they woul d be sent to one of the Soviet Ace Spy Schools, where the training could last for up t o ten years. The Prakhovka Ace Spy School was located near Minsk , within a 220 square mile area along the border of the Latvian Soviet Republi c. The northern sector was for Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Finland; the southwest ern sector was for the Netherlands; the southern area was for Austria and Switzerland; and the southeastern area was for Germany. At the Stiepnaya Ace Spy Scho ol, near Chkalov, along the northern border of the Kazakh Soviet Republic, the northwestern section was for France; the northern area for the Spanish countries ; the northeastern section for Italy; and the southern end for Portugal, Brazil, Argentin a and Mexico. The Vostocznaya Ace Spy School near Khabarovsk, was for Asian and Middl e East countries; and the Novaya Ace Spy School, near Tashkent, was for the African countries. Another Soviet Spy School was located in Gaczyna, i n a 425 square mile area along the southern border of the Tarter Autonomous Soviet Republic, and continuing to the Bashkir Autonomous Soviet Republic. It was sealed o ff for a radius of thirty miles by State Security, and the location was so secret, tha t it was not shown on any map. It was known to only the highest officers of the Secret Se rvice. The School was developed for those selected to work in the English)speaking worl d, and was divided into three sections: the northern section was for North Americ a and Canada; the northeastern section was for the United Kingdom; and the souther n area was for Australia, New Zealand, India, and South Africa. There was no comm unication between the different areas. In the United Kingdom section, the candidate would live in actual British)style homes, hotels, and apartments, which were full)size replicas of actual English buildings, on actual streets. There were British banks, restau rants, theaters, and a Post Office, all in a sixty square mile area. Here the recruit ate B ritish food, wore British clothes, rode London buses, and received a weekly salary dispense d in British currency, read English papers and magazines, and watched English televisio n shows. The recruits were given English names, and were ordered to speak only Engli sh, which they were given five years to master. They had to learn all necessary Br itish customs. During the second five years, they memorized unbrea kable codes, and were taught how to assemble and dismantle radio receivers and t ransmitters; and were taught how to use photographic equipment to reduce blueprints, records, and documents into"},{"pageNumber":458,"pageContent":"microdots. They were given further instruction in g uerrilla warfare. After this intensive training, the recruit was, in almost every way, British. Each agent was smuggled into the country of their training, wh ich in this case was England. They would never again see their families. They would be given actual identification and ‘cover’ documents from people who were dead or miss ing, so that a background check couldn’t reveal their true identities. Within their new identity, they became involved in public life, working to undermine the government as a representative of the communist government of the Soviet Union. China had similar schools, but their training perio d was only ten months, because spies were recruited mainly for Chiang Kai)shek’s N ationalist China, and other countries within Asia, where they would fit in. To infiltrate the West, the Chinese recruited people from all over the world, and smuggled them into Chi na to undergo training. The school in the Honan province was for France, Italy, and Sp ain; the school in the Chekiang province was for West Germany; and the school in th e Shantung province was for Austria, Switzerland, and the Arab countries. At the start of World War II, Roosevelt made Gen. W illiam Donovan the head of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS). Donovan didn’t see anything wrong with Communists, and recruited OSS personnel from Commun ist ranks. When the FBI discovered this, and informed him, he said: “I know they’re Communists. That’s why I hired them.” After the war, the OSS became known as the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and in 1952, the head of the CIA, Gen. Walte r Bedell Smith, said that he was sure there were Communists working inside the CIA. Three high)level Soviet KGB defectors, Anatoli Golitsin, Yuri Nosenko, and Mich ael Goleniewski, acknowledged their belief that there were Communist spies in the U.S. intelligence community. Retired Air Force Major General Follette Bradley, wrote a lette r, published by the New York Times , on August 31, 1951, that Russian representatives an d military personnel came into our country, and were “free to move about without restr aint or check, and in order to visit our arsenals, depots, factories, and proving ground s, they had only to make known their desires ...

I await with impatience my talks with your President (Eisenhower), hoping that our two he arts will be prompted to reach agreement and establish conditions of peace and fri endship.” The Special Committee of Investigation for the Unit ed Mine Workers of America, said in a Report: “The major points in this revolutionary program of the Communists are: 1) Overthrow and destruction of the Federal, State, and Provincial governments, with the elimination of existing constitutional for ms and foundations. 2) Establishment of a Soviet dictatorship, absolute in its exercise of power, owing allegiance to, and conceding the authority only of the Communist, or Third Internationale, at Moscow, as a ‘governmental’ subs titute. 3) Destruction of all social, economic, and polit ical institutions as they exist at this time. 4) Seizure of all labor unions through a process of ‘boring from within’ them, and utilizing them as a strategic instrument in fulfill ment of their revolutionary designs upon organized and constitutional government.” In 1960, American subversives received a new direct ive from Moscow: “1) Comrades working in telegraph, teleprinter, and telephone services must organize an effective monitoring system to intercep t important communications, and enable the Party to learn what is going on insi de the U.S. Government, the Security forces, industry, and in all other importa nt establishments. 2) Comrades working in armament factories or in nuc lear establishments must memorize all charts, blueprints, production lists, etc. that they come upon through their employment.

The people that the Kr emlin sends over here are, to a man, trained agents of Soviet policy. Some of the m are spies, seeking information; all of them are trusted carriers of Co mmunist propaganda. Their mission is not cultural, but political. Their aim i s not to inform, but to mislead. Their assignment is not to convey a true image of t he Soviet Union, but a false image. The Kremlin’s hope is that they will persuad e the American people to forget the ugly aspects of Soviet life, and the dan ger that the Soviet system poses to American freedom ... But the Kremlin’s aim is not to make American’s approve of Communism, much as they would like that; it is to make us tolerant of Communism ... They know that if Americans regard th e Soviet Union as a dangerous implacable enemy, Communism will not be a ble to conquer the world.” During the Johnson Administration, 66 Senators vote d for the Consulate Treaty, despite the tremendous public criticism of it, whic h opened up the country to spies and saboteurs, who would be protected with the mantle o f diplomatic immunity. In 1905, Lenin wrote his Instructions to Revolutionaries , which indicated how important it was to concentrate on young people. He wrote: “Go to the youth. Form fighting squads everywhere a t three, ten, and thirty persons. Let them arm themselves at once as best th ey can, be it with a revolver, a knife, a rag soaked in kerosene to start fires .. . Some may undertake to kill a spy or blow up a police station, others to raid a b ank ... for insurrection ... let every group learn, if only by beating up a policema n; this will train hundreds of experienced fighters who tomorrow will be leading h undreds of thousands...” In 1919, a pamphlet called Communist Rules for Revolution was aimed at hooking young people: “Get the youth corrupted, get them aw ay from religion. Get them interested in sex ... Destroy their ruggedness C Ge t control of all publicity ... Divide the people into hostile groups by constantly harping on controversial matters ... Destroy the people’s faith in their leaders ... Always preach t rue democracy, but seize power as fact and us ruthlessly as possible ... Encourage governm ent extravagance ... Destroy its credit ... Incite unnecessary strikes and civil dis obedience C Cause the registration of firearms on some pretext, with view to confiscate t hem, leaving the population helpless.” In the mid)1960’s, Moscow and Peking told their arm ies of subversives to “concentrate upon the young, the most malleable and most gullible section of the"},{"pageNumber":461,"pageContent":"population.” A directive from the Special Division for Subversion, in April, 1968, which was sent to West Germany, said: “Action must be taken at once to create disruptive situations that will rock the very foundations of the capitalist system.

The objective is to bring the maximum of factories to a complete sta ndstill ... Demonstrations must be instigated on every possible occasion. Demo nstrations are a symptom of public discontent ... Revolutionary action by stude nts must be stepped up. Every effort must be made now to encourage students to de monstrate, and if possible, to riot on the largest possible scale. Students are susceptible to an idealistic approach. They should be tackled on the lines laid down in our previous directives ... When known Communist Party members a re persuading others to take military action, our undercover subverters mus t oppose this communist inspired action. It is vitally important for them t o safeguard their established undercover positions.” A similar directive was sent to France in 1968: “The student population must be induced to demonstr ate publicly and fight vigorously for their rights. Subtle undercover tact ics must be adopted to ensure these demonstrations culminate in rioting and stree t fighting. The objective is to create a dangerous, revolutionary situation in whic h law and order is discredited ... Simultaneously our undercover cadres in industr y, commerce, the trade unions, religious organizations and political parti es, must propagate the idea that the working population should give full support to any students’ strike actions.” While the Soviets were calling for more “grievance strikes, more wildcat strikes, and more trade union obstruction to smooth working of i ndustry; more racial riots, and more sabotage to industrial plants,” Red China’s agents were instructed to “seize every opportunity to speed drug addiction,” and all sorts of drugs were smuggled into the West. Russia later adopted the same strategy. Chou En)lai told Egyptian President Nasser, in 1966, of his plans to turn our American soldiers into drug addicts: “The more troops they (America) send to Vietnam, the happier we shall be. We shall then have them in our power and can have their blood.” "},{"pageNumber":462,"pageContent":" Gamal Abdel Nasser In addition to the undercover subversion, there are various Communist Parties established in various countries. If the Party is o utlawed, they function under the name of the “Worker’s Party” or the “Socialist Party.” O ver 80 countries had Parties that were officially recognized by the Comintern in Moscow. T he leaders of these Parties were sent to Moscow for training in communist theory and revolutionary tactics, so they could return to spread propaganda in order to recruit mem bers. Organized communism began in the United States when Socialist Eugene V. Debs ran for the Presidency in 1900, 1904, and 1908. Whe n he ran in 1912, he garnered over 6% of the vote. The U.S. Communist Party was organi zed in 1919, having sprung from ideas gleaned from books and pamphlets smuggled in from Europe, and nurtured by members of the I Iluminati. They joined the Comintern, which is the world Communist organization run by the Soviet Union. Eugene V.

There were also a number of bilateral organizations , known as ‘Friendship Societies’ which also work under Soviet direction, some of the se were: British)Soviet Friendship Society, Britain)China Friendship Society, Soviet)I ndia Friendship Society, and the Society for Friendship with the Peoples of Africa. On top of all of this support, Communism also had i ts apologists and representatives in our government, such as Sen. J. William Fulbrigh t (a CFR member), Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who said in a s peech on the floor of the Senate, on June 29, 1961, concerning world Communism: “We c an hope to do little more than mitigate our problems as best we can and learn how to live with them.” He believed that once Russia caught up to the United States in techn ology, relations would improve between the two countries. He advocated increased a id, and compromises to avoid direct confrontation. He felt that the presence of Soviet missiles in Cuba did not endanger our national security. When Tito, the Yugo slavia dictator, joined with Russia to provide “all necessary aid to North Vietnam,” Fulbr ight said that Yugoslavia had “proven itself a reliable and stalwart associate in the adv ancement of certain interests on which our interests coincide.” Later, the Johnson Adminis tration sent them 700,000 tons of American wheat, 92,000 bales of cotton, and gave th em a loan for $175 million to aid their economy and industry. Jimmy Carter said in 1980: “Being confident of our own future, we are now free of that inordinate fear of communism.” Walter Mondale said in 1981: I’m very worried about U.S.)Soviet relations. I cannot understand– i t just baffles me why the Soviets these last few years have behaved as they have. May be we have made some mistakes...” Sen.

However, no treaty was signed, because they could never agree on all points. For instance, Russia wanted the U.S. to dis mantle all foreign bases and destroy nuclear weapons, but this would have given Russia a n edge in conventional weapons. The Disarmament Committee of the United Nations, co mposed of 18 members, also failed to come up with an adequate agreement betwee n the two countries. President John F. Kennedy had promised to close the missile gap in order to reestablish our military strength, but his Secretar y of Defense, Robert McNamara, wanted to allow our defense program to decline unti l Russia was equal to us. In a speech on September 18, 1967, McNamara said that ou r inventory of nuclear warheads was “greater than we had originally planned and in fact more than we require.” The move towards unilateral disarmament began when McNa mara announced that Russia wouldn’t sign an arms limitation agreement until th ey caught up to the United States in strategic offensive weapons."},{"pageNumber":466,"pageContent":"   John F.

These conferences developed into the SALT I Agreeme nt, which was signed by President Richard M. Nixon and Soviet Premier Leoni d I. Brezhnev in 1972. While the number of U.S. strategic missiles had been frozen a t the 1967 level, the Soviets had continued to build, matching that amount in 1970. B y 1972, Russia had a 3)2 advantage in the number of intercontinental ballistic missile s (ICBM’s). Aleksei N. Kosygin and Lyndon B. Johnson "},{"pageNumber":467,"pageContent":"   Richard M. N ixon  Leonid I. Brezhnev SALT I was actually two agreements. The first was a treaty of indefinite duration, restricting defensive anti)ballistic missiles (ABM’ s) to 200 on each side (reduced to 100 in a 1974 agreement). It also froze the number of o ffensive missiles at the 1972 level for five years. With Russia having 2,358 land and sea)b ased missiles, and the U.S. only 1,710, the Soviets were certainly getting the best part of that deal. Submarine)based missiles were restricted by a complicated formula w hich gave the Russians a numerical advantage, but was balanced by permitting the U.S. more warheads for its reliable and more accurate missiles. The second part of the agreement was a five)year pa ct limiting some offensive strategic weapons, and the number of launchers for ICBM’s carrying nuclear warheads. It limited each side to 2 ABM installations, totali ng 200 missile launchers; one at the nation’s capitol, and the other would protect an of fensive missile site (Grand Forks, North Dakota). This stipulation was amended in 1974 to only one site in each country. SALT I was ratified by an 88)2 vote in the Senate, but the Jackson Amendment stipulated that the next agreement was to be more e qual. The Agreement was to remain in effect until October 3, 1977. On November 24, 1974 , President Gerald R. Ford and Brezhnev reached an agreement to limit the number of all offensive stra tegic weapons and delivery systems until December 31, 1985. Gerald R. Ford"},{"pageNumber":468,"pageContent":"SALT II was a treaty that resulted from a second ro und of talks, and was signed by President Jimmy Carter and Brezhnev on June 18, 197 9, and was to remain in effect until 1985. It limited each side to 2,400 ICBM laun chers and long range bombers, within six months of ratification (by the end of 1981, a n ew limit of 2,250 was to take effect). It would allow each country to develop one new missile , and to modernize their existing weaponry, with certain limitations. Each side would be expected to verify the other’s compliance by its own surveillance methods. Regardl ess of the many stipulations, it still did not meet the requirements of the Jackson Equali ty Amendment. The numbers were manipulated to make them appear equal. For example, in the count of U.S. Strategic Weapons, 100 B)52’s (a heavy bomber capable of hitt ing speeds of 650 mph, altitudes of 50,000 ft., and has air)launched missiles and bo mbs which can hit several targets hundreds of miles apart) that were mothballed in a graveyard in Arizona, were included, even though it would take more than a year to get t hem all flying again. However, 150 of the new Russian ‘Backfire’ bombers were not counted . Jimmy Carter A prominent general stated: “If SALT II is passed, we are in the final 1000 days of history.” The Senate never ratified SALT II, because the Sovi et Union invaded Afghanistan; however, the U.S. adhered to it, but not Russia. Assistant to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of St aff, Air Force Lieutenant General John S. Pustay said that the Russians, for years, h ave continued to “out)man, out)gun, out)build ... us in most meaningful military catego ries.” The Soviets had outspent us in a display of armament and mobilization that had not o ccurred since Hitler’s preparations for World War II. According to 1991 statistics, Rus sia’s defense spending was 8% (down from 11)13% in the late 1970’s) of their Gros s National Product, while ours was only 5.7% (down from 6.1% in the late 1970’s). If their military escalation wasn’t an indication o f their intentions, then the capabilities of their civil defense program should have been. Re tired Air Force General G. J. Keegan, Jr. said: “The Soviets have deployed and de veloped the most intensive system of nuclear shelter for its military leadership, its civilian leadership, its industrial factory workers, and its civilian population ever deployed or built in history.” New housing construction included mandatory underground shelter s. They have built 1,575 huge"},{"pageNumber":469,"pageContent":"underground command posts, each the size of the Whi te House, embedded in the earth up to 400 feet deep, and covered by 75 feet of rein forced concrete. They have protected water, power generators, and communications systems . The Pentagon estimated that each post cost about $500 million. In the event of a nuclear exchange, it is believed that a large part of the Russian population would surviv e. Meanwhile, the United States Government has literal ly abandoned its civil defense program, in lieu of the “Continuity of Government” plan developed by the Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA). There a re said to be as many as 96 underground facilities throughout Maryland, West Vi rginia, Virginia, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina that will house government officials in case of an impending nuclear incident. The most prolific is a highly classified underground city, with a subterranean lake for drinking water, 40 miles east of Washingto n, DC, in the Appalachian foothills, known as Mount Weather. It has streets, sidewalks, offices, houses, and a medical facility. It will house federal government official s, and contain all records on its computers, such as census, Social Security, and IRS information. Civilians will be left to seek out the 235,000 buildings designated as fall)o ut shelters. In addition, the Defense Department’s Civil Defense Preparedness Agency (DCP A) indicates that there is the potential for sheltering 50 million people in mines . Nevertheless, if a nuclear exchange were to occur today, the best estimates are that 16 0,000,000 Americans would die, but only 5,000,000 Russians. Mount Weather The Russians have 100 times as many radar detectors than we have, and on top of that, Air Force experts once said that the U.S. Rad ar System is so inferior, that Russia could sneak in as many as 50 bombers through its ho les, in a surprise attack. Phyllis Schlafly and Chester Ward wrote in Kissinger on the Couch : “Every single key provision of both SALT agreements originated wi th Soviet strategic experts and planners in the Kremlin, approved by Leonid Brezhne v and his closest associates in the Politburo, and was passed by Soviet Ambassador Anat oly F. Dobrynin to Henry Kissinger, who then provided the rationalization fo r it and ‘sold’ it to President Nixon.” "},{"pageNumber":470,"pageContent":"  Phyllis Schlafly  Anatoly F. Dobrynin  Henry Kissinger In the book, An Analysis of SALT II , compiled by Congress, it states: “In short, the Soviets will soon have a ‘first strike capability’ authorized by SALT. And when that capability is in hand, Soviet leaders may logically presume that the U.S. would not retaliate after a first strike ... Soviet leaders c ould reason that a U.S. President would not order a retaliation, knowing that his few survi ving weapons could not annihilate Soviet society; and that a counterstrike by Soviet second)strike weapons would, in fact, utterly destroy the U.S. as a viable society ... Th e fact is that after a first strike, the Soviets would have more missiles and bombers in res erve for the second strike that the U.S. had to start with.” Despite this knowledge, disarmament has continued. Carter canceled plans for the production of the B)1 Strategic bomber, which was t o be built by Rockwell International, General Electric, and the Boeing Co. The B)1 was to replace the obsolete B)52, and would have the capability of evading Soviet radar d etection because of its ability to fly at high speeds, at low altitudes; and twice the speed of sound at higher altitudes. They would be able to carry a weapons payload twice the amount of the B)52, including 24 SRAM’s (short)range attack missiles) inside its bod y, and eight on its wings. Internally, it can carry 75,000 pounds of conventional bombs, in a ddition to 40,000 externally. Its take)off distance is half that of the B)52, giving it access to more areas. Since 1961, about 1,000 of our B)57 strategic bombe rs have been phased out, and the supersonic B)58’s were deactivated in 1970. The Russians, however, produced their delta)wing su personic ‘Backfire’ bomber, which has a maximum range of over 5,000 miles, and can travel 1,500 mph. This means that they can be launched from bases in the S iberia, can cross the United States to refuel in Cuba, or somewhere else in Latin Ameri ca. They were not covered by SALT. Also, not included in SALT, were Russia’s mobilized ICBM’s. They can be hidden, and there is no way to keep track of how many they have, The U.S. had planned to have 200 MX missiles, each armed with ten nuclear w arheads, hidden throughout 4,600 shelters in the obscure valleys of Nevada and Utah, which could be moved periodically, so that Russian spy satellites couldn’t pinpoint th eir exact location. It would have taken two Russian missiles at each site to be sure of neu tralizing it, which is more than they have. This would give the U.S. time to retaliate wi th stationery missile silos. The MX system, with its 2,000 warheads, would have the cap ability of devastating the Soviet"},{"pageNumber":471,"pageContent":"Union. The idea for the MX was opposed, and dropped from consideration. Soviet fixed silos are designed to refire, ours are not; and they have at least 1,000 extra missiles for refiring. They also have larger missiles, giving them a 6)1 advantage in firepower. The Soviet’s SS)9 Scarp Rocket can lift five times the load that the U.S.’s LGM)30 G Minuteman missile (which has 3 MIRV warheads) can, and hurl a 35)kiloton multiple warhead close to 6,600 miles, enabling it to destro y a group of U.S. ICBM silos. The SS)18 is so accurate, that at the most, it would mi ss by only 400 yards. It can carry a 20)megaton warhead, or three smaller warheads, each independently aimed. It can even carry 14 one)megaton warheads, all of which co uld directed to different locations, delivering enough explosive power to destroy a larg e city. With a single warhead, the missile can travel 5,700 miles, but only 4,700 with a multiple warhead. The SS)19, which is smaller, can only carry six warheads. With their increased number of warheads, and improved accuracies, the Pentagon ind icated that Russia’s SS)18 and SS)19 missiles could destroy America’s land)based m issile force of 1,000 Minuteman and 54 Titans in a single barrage, giving them a fi rst)strike capability. Russia’s biggest missile can carry 30 warheads, while our largest ca n only carry three 1)megaton warheads. Keep in mind, Russia also has many small missiles, such as the SS)20, a mobile multiple warhead missile, with a range of ov er 5,000 miles, that would be effective in taking out NATO ports and airfields, a nd with the addition of a rocket booster, could reach the United States. It was not covered by SALT. The Russians also developed the SS)24, a rail)mobile missile, and the SS)25, a road)mobile missile. In 1977, Brezhnev called for a joint renunciation o f neutron weapons, and in 1978, Carter said they wouldn’t be produced. However, in 1981, P resident Reagan made the decision to begin production of the Neutron bomb, a nd Russia’s edge in strategic weapons didn’t seem that important after this addit ion to our nuclear arsenal. The Lance missile, and eight)inch artillery shells in the U.S . were furnished with a radiation enhanced warhead, which contained a radioactive iso tope known as tritium, that produces far more radiation, and far less explosion and heat than conventional nuclear weapons. The result is that they kill people, witho ut that much damage to surrounding buildings. It was designed to stop Russian tanks in Europe. The Tass News Agency in Russia responded by saying: “It seems that the same cannibalistic instincts prevail now in the White House by which in 1945 the then Presid ent Truman was guided when ordering the use of atomic weapons.” "},{"pageNumber":472,"pageContent":" Ronald Reagan America had an edge with the Navy’s nuclear)powered , nuclear)armed Polaris submarines. While at sea, they can’t be detected, y et they can track Russian subs because of their ultra)sensitive electronic surveil lance system. Knowing this, Russia stepped up the development of their long)range miss iles. The Polaris subs can fire 16 missiles (each having ten warheads), in eight minut es to hit 160 targets, hundreds of miles apart, from a location almost 3,000 miles awa y, The Soviets began producing their larger Delta)class submarine, the Typhoon, wh ich at 25,000)30,000 tons, is the world’s largest. It carries 20 SLBM SS)N)20 interco ntinental nuclear missiles, which have a range of 4,800 miles, farther than ours. It is capable of striking any target in the United States from protected Soviet waters. The Typ hoon subs, built at Severodvinsk, the world’s largest submarine production yard, are designed to operate under the Arctic Ocean ice cap. They also began producing the Soviet submarines with torpedo)proof titanium hulls. Even though Russia had more tanks than we did, the NATO force tanks, for example, had about 193,000 anti)tank missiles, whic h was nine times the number that was in the arsenal of the Warsaw Pact. They are acc urate from distances up to two miles away, which is outside the range of Russia’s tanks. However, Russia developed the T)80 tank, which has an armor consisting of a h oneycomb process which combines steel, ceramics, and aluminum to create a substance that is three times stronger, yet weighs little more. In testimony before the Senate Armed Services Commi ttee, Harold Brown, Carter’s Secretary of Defense, said: “The United States is n ot now inferior to the Soviet Union in overall military strength.” Yet, the figures availa ble during the SALT talks, indicated that Russia was outspending us 3)1 for strategic arms, h ad a 2)1 advantage over us in manpower, 2)1 advantage over us in offensive strate gic weapons, 2)1 in major surface combat ships and subs, 2)1 advantage in helicopter production, a 3)1 advantage in nuclear)powered subs, a 4)1 advantage in tanks and artillery, a 5)1 advantage in naval ships, a 5)1 edge in the production of tanks and co mbat vehicles, a 6)1 edge in nuclear firepower (megatonage) , a 7)1 advantage in artille ry, a 10)1 advantage in fighter bombers, a 47)1 advantage in defensive strategic we apons, and a 100)1 advantage in regular ammunition. Brown did admit, later, in Janu ary, 1979, that the Russian military was “potentially very dangerous to us.”"},{"pageNumber":473,"pageContent":" Harold Brown The Soviet nuclear war plan, called the Red Integra ted Strategic Operations Plant (RISOP) by the Pentagon, is believed to include ove r 2,500 targets: 1,000 Minuteman and ICBM silos, 100 ICBM launch control centers, an d 50 command and control facilities and nuclear weapons storage depots; 54 n uclear bomber and bomber dispersal bases and 3 naval bases that service miss ile)firing submarines; 475 naval bases, airfields, ports, terminals, camps, depots a nd other military installations; 150 industrial production facilities that have Defense Department contracts for $1 million or more a year in military equipment; close to 325 ele ctric power plants that generate nearly 70% of the nation’s electricity; about 150 o il refineries that produce about 70% of the country’s petroleum products; about 200 ‘soft’ targets including economic communications, transportation, chemical, and civil ian leadership targets.

For some reason, the United States government tried to disguise, and hide the fact, th at we may no longer be the most powerful nation on Earth. Not only are they hiding it, but continue to make it worse with further plans for disarmament. On December 8, 1987, Russian leader Mikhail Gorbach ev and President Reagan signed the Intermediate)Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, which was to eliminate all medium and short range nuclear missiles. It was rat ified, with conditions, by the Senate, on May 27, 1988. At the time of SALT, out of 27 Summit Agreements wi th Russia, they had broken or cheated on all but one, and that includes the Nucle ar Test Ban Treaty of 1962, the ABM Treaty of 1972, SALT I, and SALT II. They cheated o n the INF Treaty of 1989, and did not fully comply with the Conventional Forces in Eu rope (CFE) Treaty of 1991. Many wars or confrontations since SALT I, had been start ed by, or influenced by Russia in one way or another.

Admiral El mo R.

Our military knows this, and so does theirs. About the only people who do not know it are the general public in the United States and Austral ia. Nor do they know that a nuclear exchange in 1981 on present trends would result in about 160 million dead in the United States.” England’s Winston Spencer Churchill (nephe w of the former Prime Minister) said in a 1977 speech to a meeting of the National Association of Freedom: “The Soviet build)up is far beyond any requirements of self)def ense, indeed the Soviets are building the greatest war machine the world has ever seen.

Afghan Minister for Foreign Affairs, Lieutenant Col onel Faiz Mohammed Khan, a member of the pro)Moscow faction of the Afghan Comm unist Party, said that Russia would take over the Baluchistan section of Iran and Pakistan, which is all that separated them from the Indian Ocean.

Khan hinted, that since more than half of the students that held our hostages in Iran were pro)Soviet Communists, the Russians may have instigated the in cident, hoping that it would escalate into a full)blown confrontation, so that t he Soviet Union could invoke a 1921 treaty with Iran that would give them a right to se nd in troops if their southern border was threatened."},{"pageNumber":475,"pageContent":"During the years when Hitler came to power in Nazi Germany, Russia made the prediction: “We will take Iran. Not by direct inter vention, but it will fall into our hands like an overripe piece of fruit.” An issue of World Crisis (published by Kilbrittain Newspapers Ltd. of Dublin, Ireland) reported during the early 1970’s: “...Russia is planning a new offensive in the Middle East. Our precise and categ orical information is that Russia plans to have totally taken over Southern Africa, a ll the Middle East, and Western Europe by January 8)9, 1984.” Alexander Ginzburg, t he exiled Russian human rights activist, said that America is threatened by “expan sionist Russian ambitions,” but won’t recognize the danger until “it comes to Mexico or C anada.” Thomas J. Watson, Jr., the American Ambassador to Russia, told President Reaga n: “I perceive the world to be more dangerous than it has ever been in its history .” The January, 1981, Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists said: “We feel impelled to record and emphasize the accelerating drift toward a disaster in almost all realms of social ac tivity, Accordingly, we have decided to move the hands of the Bulletin’s clock)symbol of th e world’s approach to nuclear doomsday– from seven to four minutes (each minute r epresents a year) before midnight (nuclear disaster).”   Alexan der I.

He pa rticipated in four Summit meetings with Reagan, and in 1987, initiated a program of re forms to bring democracy to their political process. The reforms were denounced by so me Eastern bloc countries and old) line communists. A decline in the economy, the wors t since World War II, developed an atmosphere of unrest. This is the same Gorbachev, w ho made the following statement, which was printed by Pravda on December 11, 1984: “In the struggle for peace a nd social progress the Communist Party of the Soviet U nion pursues a consistent policy of rallying the forces of the international communist and working)class movement in every possible way. We uphold the historical justness of the great ideas of Marxism)Leninism, and along with all the revolutionary and peace lovi ng forces of mankind, stand for social progress, and peace and security for all nations. T his is what should determine the resolute nature of our propaganda.”"},{"pageNumber":476,"pageContent":" Mikhail Gorbachev Gorbachev said in November, 1987: “In our work and worries, we are motivated by those Leninist ideals and noble endeavors and goals which mobilized the workers of Russian seven decades ago to fight for the new and happy world of socialism. Perestroika (restructuring) is a continuation of th e October Revolution.” He also said: “Gentlemen, Comrades, do not be concerned about all you hear about glasnost and perestroika and democracy in the coming years. Thes e are primarily for outward consumption. There will be no significant internal change within the Soviet Union, other than for cosmetic purposes. Our purpose is to disar m the Americans and let them fall asleep.” On another occasion he said: “We are movin g toward a new world, the world of Communism. We shall never turn off that road.” In February, 1989, after a futile eight year guerri lla war against government rebels in Afghanistan, the Soviets pulled their troops out of the country. The Communist super) power had lost a lot of the prestige that years of propaganda had built up, and the embarrassing defeat signaled the beginning of the e nd. Gorbachev said: “We are not going to change Soviet power, of course, or abandon its fundamental principles, but we acknowledge the need for changes that will strengthen socialism.” In October, 1989, Gorbachev said: “The concept, the main idea, lies in the fact that we want to give a new lease o n life to socialism through perestroika and to reveal the potential of the socialist system .” Also in 1989, he said: “Through perestroika we want to give Socialism a second wind . To achieve this, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union returns to the origins an d principles of the Bolshevik Revolution, to the Leninist ideas about the constru ction of a new society.” He said in December, 1989: “Today we have perestroika, the sal vation of socialism, giving it a second breath, revealing everything good which is i n the system.” He also said: “I am a Communist, a convinced Communist. For some that may be a fantasy. But for me, it is my main goal.” In June, 1990, he said: “I am now, j ust as I’ve always been, a convinced Communist. It’s useless to deny the enormous and un ique contribution of Marx, Engels and Lenin to the history of social thought and to m odern civilization as a whole.” On August 19, 1991, a report from Russia indicated that Gorbechev had become ill, and the Vice)President had taken over the country, imposing a state of emergency. In reality, the military, the KGB, and communist hardl iners had initiated a coup to take over the government. Or at least that is what they wante d us to think.

He reported that all eight coup leaders were Gorbachev appointees, and coup leader, Gennady Yanayev, referred to himself as the “acting President,” saying that Gorbachev would return to power after he recovered from his “illness.” In all past coups and revolutions, the KGB would have killed Gorbache v, and other reform leaders; but they weren’t even arrested. Only a minimal amount o f troops participated in the coup, the internal or international lines of communicatio n were not cut, the press was not controlled, and the airports were not closed. A ver y strange “coup” indeed. Boris Yeltsin, the President of the Russian Republi c, denounced the coup, and called for a show of force, which produced about 50 ,000 demonstrators at the Russian parliament. The picture of him on top of a Soviet t ank, in open defiance of the Communist hardliners, was an indelible image in the hearts of the Soviet people, and the world. This Russian “John Wayne” had joined the Communist Party in 1961, at the age of 30, and by December, 1985, had been appointe d head of the 1.2 million member Moscow City Party Committee, the largest Communist organization in the Soviet Union.

Of the eight coup leaders, one was said to have com mitted suicide, and may have been murdered; the other seven were tried and imprisoned . In the past, such men would have just been shot, which gives credibility to the theo ry that the coup was a hoax. They were later released from prison. Shortly after the coup, the President of Soviet Geo rgia accused Gorbachev of masterminding the coup. Eduard Shevardnadze, Gorbac hev’s former foreign minister, even said that he may have been behind it. Private polls indicated that 62% of the Soviet people believed the coup to be staged. So wh at did the coup accomplish? In light of the sagging economy, the coup was to give Gorbac hev the appearance of grabbing control back from the old)guard Communists, which w ould boost his popularity with the Soviet people, and make the West think that there w as a potential for widespread democratic reforms in Russia.

The Communist Party in Italy became known as the Democratic Party; in Poland, it became known as the Social Democratic Party; and in Romania, it was called the New Salvation Front. On September 2nd, Gorbachev announced that his coun try was “on the brink of catastrophe,” and that all authority was to be tran sferred to himself, the Presidents of the ten independent republics, and an appointed leg islative council, which would be the basis for a new Soviet Union. However, Gorbachev wo uld not be the one to lead it. The coup was not able to rally the support that he need ed, and on December 25th, 1991, he resigned, and said: “I hereby discontinue my activi ties at the post of president of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. We’re now livi ng in a New World!” The next day, the Soviet Union officially broke up, ending the domina tion of the Communist Party. Yeltsin became President of a Russian Federation kn own as the Union of Soviet Sovereign Republics.

Bush Elena Bonner, the widow of Sakharov, said: “The poi nt is that the Communist goal is fixed and changeless it never varies one iota from their objective of world domination, but if we judge them only by the direction in which they seem to be going, we shall be deceived.” Former NATO Supreme Allied Commander Ber nard W. Rogers said: “The Soviet goal remains world domination.” In 1981, Ana toly Golitsyn, a former major in the KGB, who defected to the West, wrote a book called New Lies For Old: The Communist Strategy of Deception and Disinformation , which was published in 1984. He outlined virtually everything that had taken place in Russia , such as the tearing down of the Berlin Wall and the reunification of East and West Germany; the partial relinquishing of"},{"pageNumber":480,"pageContent":"their control of Eastern Europe; and the declaratio n that communism is dead. He wrote that their plan was to deceive the West into believ ing that the Soviet Union was falling apart, their satellites splintering, and its econom y in shambles. The facade of weakness and instability would be part of a massive deceptio n staged by the Kremlin to extort aid from the West, and to get the United States to with draw troops out of Western Europe. It was Lenin who said: “We advance through retreat.” H e also said: “When we are weak, boast of strength ... when we are strong, feign wea kness.” Elena Bonner and Andrei Sakharov At various times during the history of the Soviet U nion, they have appealed to the U.S. for help, and have gotten it, mostly through d eception, and the efforts of apologists and traitors in our government. But this is the fir st time that Russia has made this kind of concession. They have made it appear that communism is dead, that democracy is sweeping the former Soviet Union and its satellite countries, and that they want to be part of the new family of nations known as the New World Order. But, with their record, can they be trusted? If you consider all the eviden ce that was put forth, it just seems to be another ploy by the Soviets to undermine America . A respected Sovietologist has stated his belief that the motive behind the Russia n’s actions, and their plea for financial aid, is not so much need, but an attempt to destroy the U.S. economy by defaulting on an international loan that could be as much as $100 billion, which could precipitate a financial collapse. Yeltsin ended up addressing a joint session of Cong ress to appeal for economic aid. The Bush Administration shut down Clark Air Force B ase in the Philippines, and announced in September, 1991, that it was also clos ing the Subic Bay Naval Base, and would completely withdraw from the island. They hav e also pulled out of, and are closing 79 military bases in Western Europe; and ha ve withdrawn U.S. nuclear missiles, tanks, planes, and troops. The U.S. also announced the withdrawal of troops from South Korea. In September, 1993, Congress approved the recommendation of the Base Closure and Realignment Commission to close 130 dom estic military bases, and scale down 45 others. Between 1990 and 1992, the total nu mber of military personnel has decreased by over 8%, and the trend to scale down o ur military was continuing. The U.S. is virtually shutting down our tank, submarine (only producing one a year, compared to one every six weeks for the Russians), and F)16 production lines.

Our government ha d set a goal of spending only 3.6% of GNP on defense by 1996. Lenin said: “They disarm, we build.” Nikita Krushch ev said in a January 14, 1969 speech to the Supreme Soviet: “The Soviets intend t o conceal vast reserves of missiles and warheads, hiding them in places throughout the expansive Soviet Union where the imperialists could not spot them. Later, they could be launched in a nuclear war.” An official in the Soviet Council of Ministers said in 1987: “Perestroika is expressly designed to enhance Soviet military capability and combat readiness.” With military actions in Bosnia and Kosovo in Yugos lavia, Afghanistan, and now Iraq, our military has become stretched around the world; and it has become preoccupied domestically with the “War on Terrorism .” Bush’s growing interaction with Putin seems to indicate that our government has con tinued to fall for the massive deception being put forth by the Russian Federation , and continues to make our country vulnerable, while it looks for ways to continue dis mantling our military in the name of creating a leaner, meaner more modern fighting forc e. Meanwhile, the Soviets are watching, and waiting, preparing to implement the n ext stage of their master plan. THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF COMMUNISM Remember how communism started? It was a created, n urtured, and supported by the I Iluminati as an opposing political ideology in orde r to achieve their goals. There is certainly enough evidence to indicate massive collu sion, but as far as being controlled by the I Iluminati, here is what Gary Allen wrote in his boo k None Dare Call It Conspiracy : “Indicative of this strange event which occurred in October of 1964. David Rockefeller, president of the Chase Manhattan Bank and Chairman of the Board of the Council on Foreign Relations, took a vacation in th e Soviet Union. This is a peculiar place for the world’s greatest ‘imperialist’ to tak e his vacation, since much of the communist propaganda deals with taking all of David ’s wealth away from him and distributing it to ‘the people.’ A few days after R ockefeller ended his ‘vacation’ in the Kremlin, Nikita Khrushchev was recalled from a vaca tion at a Black Sea resort to learn that he had been fired. How strange! As far as the world knew, Khrushchev was the absolute dictator of the Soviet government and, mor e important, head of the Communist Party which runs the USSR. Who has the power to fir e the man who was supposedly the absolute dictator? Did David Rockefeller journe y to the Soviet Union to fire an employee? Obviously the position of Premier in the Soviet Union is a figurehead with the true power residing elsewhere.

Thornton Arnold Wilson In the Communist Manifesto , Karl Marx wrote about the abolition of private pr operty, a progressive income tax, a central bank, and state control of the family, religion, and education, which are all aspects of a Socialist gov ernment, the prelude to the utopian goal of Communism. Yet, they are part of our own po litical system, which has lead to the ‘convergence theory.’ The theory is, that while the Soviets would slowly move to the political right, the United States would be pushed to the left, with the two meeting in the middle as Social Democrats. And from there, it woul d only a small step to a socialist one)world government, or the New World Order. Norma n Thomas (1884)1968), known as the “conscience of America,” who ran for Preside nt six times as a candidate of the Socialist Party, said: “The American people will ne ver knowingly adopt socialism.

Shotwell and Isaiah Bowman, members of the subcommittee, were also members of the League of Nations Association, and h ad been on Col. House’s staff at the Paris Peace Conference in 1918, where plans for the League of Nations had been laid out. This established a direct link between th e League of Nations and the United Nations.

As you have read, there was a strong communist infl uence during the establishment of the organization, and all indications are that i t has maintained a socialistic slant to its affairs. Earl Browder, a former leader in the U.S. Communist Party, said in his book Victory and After : “The American Communists worked energetically and tirelessly to lay the foundations for the United Nations, which we we re sure would come into existence.” Alger Hiss, who was later convicted as a communist traitor, became the acting Secretary)General after the establishment of the UN . The April 16, 1945 issue of Time magazine called him “one of the State Department’s brighter young men.” It was Hiss, and Joseph E. Johnson (who later became Secretary o f the Bilderbergers) who wrote much of the UN Charter, patterning it after the Con stitution of Russia, and the Communist Manifesto . An Associated Press dispatch from April 7, 1970 w hich appeared in the Los Angeles Times said: “Secretary)General U Thant praised Vladimir I.

Nonaligned nations, a majority of the delegates, voted with the communists 85% of the time in the General Assembly; and in 1987, member nations voted with the U.S. only 18.7% of the time. In fact , on key issues, the UN has voted against the United States nearly 85% of the time. The Constitutional right of Congress to declare war has been completely transferred to the UN Military Committee, and as such, they can order us into war at any time, without our consent, as they did in Korea. The Unit ed States didn’t make the treaty with Japan to end World War II, it was made with the UN. The UN refused to come to the aid of China in 1949, ignored the Hungarian freedom fig hters in 1956, shunned the Tibetans when they were attacked by Chinese Communists, and in the early 1960’s, supported the communist attempt to overthrow the African coun try of Katanga. They even criticized the American invasion of Grenada, which sought to stem communist activity in the Caribbean. Remember, the Under Secretary for Po litical and Security Council Affairs had always been a Russian, who along with t he Chairman of the UN Military Staff Committee was responsible for all UN military action. Prior to the Korean War, the Chairman was Lt. Gen. Alexandre Vasiliev, who took a leave of absence from the position to command the communist troops, and actua lly gave the orders to attack. He continued to get valuable information about the UN’ s military plans from his handpicked successor, Gen. Ivan A. Skliaro. In 1915, in No. 40 of the Russian document The Socialist Democrat , Lenin called for a “United States of the World.” The Communist Inter national in 1936, said that a world dictatorship “can be established only by victory of socialism in different countries or groups of countries, after which the Proletariat Re publics would unite on federal lines with those already in existence, and this system wo uld expand ... at length forming the World Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.” In the November, 1946 issue of the communist publication Bolshevik , it said: “The masses know that peace is possible only on the basis of cooperation among the existing stat es ...

One man, calling himself John Doe, who was involved in the Report, decided to release its contents, it was published in 1967 by D ial Press (a division of Simon and Schuster) as the Report From Iron Mountain on the Possibility and De sirability of Peace . Even though it was publicly renounced by the Establ ishment as a hoax, it was translated into fifteen languages. The SSG concluded that peace “would almost certainl y not be in the best interest of stable society,” because War, was too much a part o f the world economy, and therefore it was necessary to continue a state of war indefin itely: “War has provided both ancient and modern societies with a dependable system for stabilizing and controlling national economies. No alternate method of control has yet been tested in a complex modern economy tha t has shown itself remotely comparable in scope or effectiveness. War fills certain functions essential to the stability of our society; until ot her ways of filling them are developed, the war system must be maintained, and i mproved in effectiveness.” It also said that war, “provides anti)social elemen ts with an acceptable role in the social structure ... the younger, and more dangerou s, of these hostile social groupings have been kept under control by the Selective Servi ce System ... man destroys surplus members of his own species by organized warfare ... enables the physically deteriorating older generation to maintain control of the younger, destroying it if necessary.” The report also argued that the authority that the government exercised over the people came from its ability to wage war, and that without war the government might cease to exist: “War is virtually synonymous with n ationhood. The elimination of war implies the inevitable elimination of national sove reignty and the traditional nation)state.” The Report covered a number of recommendations that the Federal government should do in the event that they were thrust into a n era of peace: “(a) A comprehensive social)welfare program, direct ed toward maximum improvement of general conditions of human life; (b ) A giant open)end space research program, aimed at unreachable targets; (c) A permanent, ritualized, ultra)elaborate disarmament inspection system, and variant of such a system.” It also recommended the invention of “alternate ene mies.” Then in 1972, in a New York Times article, Leonard C. Lewin, a New York free lance writer and editor ( A Treasury of American Political Humor ), who wrote the introduction to the book, confessed to being the author of the Repo rt, and said he wrote it “to caricature the bankruptcy of the think)tank mentality by pursu ing its style of scientific thinking to its logical ends.” In 1996 Simon & Schuster reprinted the Report with a new introduction. Evidently the germination of the Report took place in 1966 wh en Victor Navasky (Publisher and Editorial Director of The Nation ), who was editor of the Monacle a political satire magazine, read a New York Times article about the stock market declining because o f a"},{"pageNumber":501,"pageContent":"‘peace scare.’ Navasky said something to Lewin who then wrote the report, and they presented the Report to E.L.

Nava sky said the purpose of the hoax was “to provoke thinking about the unthinkable) the con version to a peacetime economy and the absurdity of the arms race.” However, some still believe the Report to be authen tic because a large portion of it has come to pass. At the Conference on Conditions of World Order, whi ch met from June 12)19, 1965 (which no doubt led to the establishment of the Clu b of Rome), at the Villa Serbelloni (facilities obtained through the Rockefeller Founda tion) in Bellagio, Italy, which was sponsored by the Congress for Cultural Freedom (wit h a grant from the Ford Foundation and the American Academy of Arts and Sci ences), 21 scholars, writers and scientists from all over the world met to define th e concepts of world order. A segment of their report, by Helio Jaguaribe said: “The establishment of world order depends not only on its intrinsic desirability and viability, but also on the support of men and g roups who decide to dedicate themselves to the completion of such a goal. As inc reasing sectors of developed and underdeveloped societies begin to realize the u rgent necessity of world order, the viability of its establishment, and the fact that it can be achieved by adopting measures which are reasonable in themselve s, none of the governments will be able to escape public pressure for establishing world order ... It is incumbent upon the intellectuals to play the decisive role in the formation of pressure groups in favor of world order ... the establishment of world order demands the mobilization of groups dedicated to int ernational pressure for the gradual implantation of that world order ... the ne gotiated establishment of world order is theoretically possible and practically fea sible since, in the last analysis, the probable effects of nuclear conflagration have made way an impractical alternative to the peaceful solution of contemporar y problems.” On May 18, 1972, Roy Ash of the Office of Managemen t and Budget during the Nixon Administration, said: “Within two decades the institutional framework for a World Economic Community will be in place ...

Originally the UN wanted the United State s to pay 50% of their budget, but eventually, negotiations lowered the amount to 39.8 9%. Later it was lowered further to 25%, or about $3.9 billion. At one point, the Sovie t Union was only paying 13%; Japan, 10%; West Germany, 8%; Great Britain, 4%; and Saudi Arabia, .5%. The 100+ Third World)non)aligned countries were only paying 9%, ye t controlled 3/4 of the voting power in the General Assembly; and the 80 poorest countri es were contributing less than 1% of the UN budget. In September, 1983, the Senate in troduced legislation that sought to cut the U.S.’s contribution by 21% for 1983)84, and 10% more for each of the following three years, which would make America’s portion of the UN budget less than 15%. The United States further showed their displeasure with the United Nations, when in December, 1983, the Reagan Administration announced it was withdrawing from UNESCO, because the UN agency had “increasingly pla ced an overfed bureaucracy at the service of a coalition of Soviet bloc and Third World countries,” which was to be effective January 1, 1985, unless reforms were made . UNESCO was labeled by newsman Paul Harvey as “communism’s trap for our yo uth.” Another area which demonstrated the UN’s communist leanings was reveal ed by the McGraw Edison Committee for Public Affairs: “The United Nations’ International Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF) ... appropriated $59,000,000 between 1947 and 1958 to Communist countries. In a ratio not unlike that of other UN v entures, the United States has furnished $42,000,000 of the money ...

But I stated at that time ‘The American people should be under no illusions that t he Charter assures lasting peace.’ But now we must realize that the United Nations has failed to give us even a remote hope of lasting peace. Instead, it adds the dangers of wars which now surround us.” An article about the UN in the March 2, 1964 edition o f the Santa Ana Register made this comment: “The whole purpose and, indeed, the method of the UN is to use armed might against any nation presumed to be an aggressor. Its function is to make war...”    Herbert Hoover Rep. John E. Rankin (D)MS, 1921)53) said: “The Unit ed Nations is the greatest fraud in all history.

On December 31, 1992, the “Single Europe Act” went into effect, uniting the 12 nations into a federation and lifting the restricti ons on the movement of goods, services, capital, workers and tourists within the Community. They also adopted common agricultural, fisheries, and nuclear research polic ies. Jacques Delors, in the Delors Report , a blueprint for EC unification, called for a “tra nsfer of decision)making power from member states to the community.” On January 1, 1995, Austria became the 13th nation.

The American Friends of B ilderbergs, with offices at 477 Madison Avenue (6th floor) in New York City, is an IRS)approved charitable organization that received regular contributions fr om the likes of Exxon, Arco, and IBM; while their meetings are funded by the Ford Foundat ion, Rockefeller Foundation, and the Carnegie Endowment Fund. The Goals 2000 program, developed during the presid ency of George Bush to revamp the nation’s public school system, was born at the April, 1970, Bilderberger meeting in Bad Ragaz, Switzerland. The purpose of t he new educational philosophy was the “subordination of national ambitions to the idea of the international community.” Because our schools are “too nationalistic,” childr en, in the future, will be indoctrinated to consider themselves “world citizens.” Prior to the 1971 meeting in Woodstock, Virginia, P rince Bernhard said that the subject of the meeting was the “change in the world role of the United States.” After the weekend conference, Kissinger was sent to Red China to open up trade relations, and an international monetary crisis developed, which p rompted the devaluing of the dollar by 8.57% (which made a tremendous profit for those who converted to the European Currency). In 1976, fifteen representatives from the Soviet Un ion attended the meeting which was held in the Arizona desert, and it was believed , that at that time, the plans were formulated for the “break)up of communism in the So viet Union.” At the 1978 meeting, they predicted that a depression would hit the worl d in 1979, and that the dollar would die. Their solution was to replace the dollar with an international ‘bancor’ system (international bank note) of currency that would be universally acceptable as a medium of exchange. The ‘bancor’ system would have the int ernational gold reserve deposited in a neutral country. It is an offshoot of the same Keynesian system developed at Bretton Woods in 1944 from the idea by German econo mist Julius Wolf in 1892. This system would protect the I Iluminati when they spring their trap, and the worl d economy would crumble. At their 1990 meeting at Glen Cove, Long Island in New York, they decided that"},{"pageNumber":531,"pageContent":"taxes had to be raised to pay more towards the debt owed to the International Bankers.

George H. W.

It would have been impossible for us to develop our plan for the world if we had been subject to the bright lights of publicity during these years.

It also related how they would blow up grain mills, derail trains, bankrupt and destroy their own companies, till they had dest royed the economy of the entire world; and yet, they would be so wealthy, that it w ould not substantially affect their vast holdings. The novel is about a man who stops the mo tor of the world, of what happens when “the men of the mind, the intellectuals of the world, the originators and innovators in every line of industry go on strike; when the me n of creative ability in every profession, in protest against regulation, quit and disappear.” Ayn Rand and her book Atlas Shrugged If we are to believe that the book represents the I Iluminati’s plans for the future, then the following excerpts may provide some insight to the mentality of the elitists who are preparing us for one)world government. One of the characters, Francisco d’Anconia, a coppe r industrialist and heir to a great fortune, the first to join the strike, says: “I am destroying d’Anconia Copper, consciously, del iberately, by plan and by my own hand. I have to plan it carefully and work as h ard as if I were producing a fortune) in order not to let them notice it and sto p me, in order not to let them seize the mines until it is too late ... I shall de stroy every last bit of it and every last penny of my fortune and every ounce of copper that could feed the looters. I shall not leave it as I found it) I shall leave it as Sebastian d’Anconia found it) then let them try to exist without him or me!” A bit later, d’Anconia says: “We produced the wealt h of the world) but we let our enemies write its moral code.” Still later, he says : “We’ll survive without it. They won’t.” Dagney Taggart, the main character of the book, is the head of the Taggart Transcontinental Railroad. Her goal was to find out who John Galt was. She discovered that he was a young inventor with the Twentieth Cen tury Motor Company, who said he"},{"pageNumber":535,"pageContent":"would put an end to the regulations which bound a m an to his job indefinitely. Before disappearing, he said: “I will stop the motor of th e world.” He told her: “Dagney, we who’ve been called ‘materialists’ ... w e’re the only ones who know how little value or meaning there is in material ob jects ... we’re the ones who create their value and meaning. We can afford to gi ve them up ... We are the soul, of which railroads, copper mines, steel mines , and oil wells are the body) and they are living entities that beat day and nigh t, like our hearts, in the sacred function of supporting human life, but only so long as they remain our body, only so long as they remain the expression, the reward a nd the property of achievement. Without us, they are corpses and their sole product is poison, not wealth or food, the poison of disintegration that t urns men into hordes of scavengers ... You do not have to depend on any mat erial possessions, they depend on you, you create them, you own the one and only tool of production ... leave them the carcass of that railroad, leave them all the rusted nails and rotted ties and gutted engines) but don’t leave them your mind.” Later in the book, Galt says: “And the same will be happening in every other indu stry, wherever machines are used) the machines which they thought could replace our minds. Plane crashes, oil tank explosions, blast furnace breakouts, high tension wire electrocutions, subway cave)ins, and trestle collapses) they’ll see them all. The very machines that made their life so safe) will now make it a co ntinuous peril ... You know that the cities will be hit worst of all. The cities wer e made by the railroads and will go with them ... When the rails are cut, the city of N ew York will starve in two days. That’s all the supply of food its got. It’s fed by a continent three thousand miles long. How will they carry food to New York? By dire ctive and ox)cart? But first, before it happens, they’ll go through the whole of the agony) through the shrinking, the shortages, the hunger riots, the sta mpeding violence in the midst of the growing stillness ... They’ll lose the airplane s first, then their automobiles, then their trucks, then their horsecarts ... Their factories will stop, then their furnaces and their radios. Then their electric ligh t system will go.” Francisco d’Anconia, who blew up all the copper min es in the world, said of Galt: “He had quit the Twentieth Century. He was living i n a garret in a slum neighborhood. He stepped to the window and pointed at the skyscrapers of the city. He said that we had to extinguish the lights of the world, and when we would see the lights of New York go out, we would know th at our job was done.” Galt led the men of the mind, on strike, and they r etired to a self)supporting valley, where a character, Midas Mulligan, says that “the w orld is falling apart so fast that it will soon be starving. But we will be able to support ou rselves in this valley.” Galt said: “There is only one kind of men who have never been on strike in human history ... the men who have carried the world on their shoulders, have kept it alive, have endured"},{"pageNumber":536,"pageContent":"torture as sole payment ... Well, their turn has co me. Let the world discover who they are, what they do and what happens when they refuse to function. This is the strike of the men of the mind.” The book describes what resulted from the strike: “ But years later, when we saw the lights going out, one after another, in the great f actories that had stood like mountains for generations, when we saw the gates closing and the conveyer belts turning still, when we saw the roads growing empty and the streams of cars draining off, when it began to look as if some silent power were stopping the generators of the world and the world was crumbling quietly...” And the culmination of their efforts: “The plane was above the peaks of the skyscrapers when suddenly, w ith the abruptness of a shudder, as if the ground had parted to engulf it, the city had disappeared from the face of the earth. It took them a moment to realize that the pa nic had reached the power stations) and the lights of New York had gone out.” The men o f the mind had taken over the world. Ayn Rand, author of Atlas Shrugged , which was a bestseller; had previously written We the Living (1936); The Fountainhead (1943), which became a 1949 movie starring Gary Cooper as an architect willing to blow up his own work, rather than see it perverted by public housing bureaucrats; and Anthem (1946). She later wrote For the New Intellectual (1961), Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal (1966), and The New Left: The Anti- Industrial Revolution (1970). She also published a monthly journal (with Nathaniel Branden, a psychological theorist) called The Objectivist . Ayn Rand Rand based her novel on her philosophy which she ca lls Objectivism. As she puts it: “We are the radicals for capitalism ... because it is the only system geared to the life of a rational being ... The method of capitalism’s destr uction rests on never letting the world discover what it is that is being destroyed.” She a lso said about the book: “I trust that no one will tell me that men such as I write about don ’t exist. That this book has been written) and published) is proof that they do.” In the book Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal , in a chapter titled “Is Atlas Shrugging” she wrote that “the purpose of this book is to prev ent itself from being prophetic.” She also quoted several news stories which seemed to in dicate that the world was indeed"},{"pageNumber":537,"pageContent":"being depleted of its brains and intellectuals. Is Atlas Shrugged a coded blueprint for the I Iluminati’s plans of bringing this world to a point where they can institute a one world govern ment?

Being that the I Iluminati is destroying our economy, and they do control the cor porate structure of the United States, if not the world, there just may be somethi ng to this book, and maybe we should consider it a warning. THE SEVEN SISTERS One oil cartel is the Organization of Petroleum Exp orting Countries, known as OPEC, which is made up of Iran, Iraq, Venezuela, Ku wait, Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Indonesia, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, and the United Ar ab Emirates. The group was created on September 14, 1960, for the purpose of setting o il prices by controlling oil production. They were originally thought to be primarily Arabia n, in ownership, however, it is actually an international group, which includes Ame ricans. The cartel was established from an agreement signed on September 17, 1920, by Royal Dutch Shell, Anglo) Iranian, and Standard Oil, for the purpose of fixin g oil prices. By 1949, the cartel was made up of Anglo)Iranian, Socony)Vacuum, Royal Dutc h Shell, Gulf, Esso, Texaco, and Calso. In the early 1950’s, revelations surfaced th at the oil companies would pump the oil from the Middle East, then split the profits wi th the government of the country where the oil was produced. OPEC was formed to make peopl e believe that the Arabian oil reserves were not owned by non)Arabian oil companie s. Those non)Arabian oil companies are another cartel, which had been informally called “The Seven Sisters,” and control what is shi pped to the United States, and how much is refined into gas and heating oil. Originall y, it was made up of the Rockefeller) controlled Exxon (previously known as Standard Oil of New Jersey, or Esso), Mobil (Socony or Standard Oil of New York, which merged w ith Vacuum Oil), and Chevron (Socal or Standard Oil of California); the Mellon’s Gulf Oil; Shell (Royal Dutch Petroleum), Texaco, and British Petroleum (Anglo)Ir anian). They controlled 90% of crude exports to world markets by controlling every important pipeline in the world, such as the 753)mile TransArabian Pipeline, from Qaisuma in Saudi Arabia to the Mediterranean Sea, which was owned by Exxon, Chevro n, Texaco, and Mobil. Exxon owned the 100)mile Interprovincial Pipeline in Cana da; and also the 143)mile pipeline in Venezuela. The 799)mile Alaskan Pipeline was owned by British Petroleum and Exxon. By controlling these, and other vital arteries, the y can restrict the flow of oil, limiting supplies to refineries.

On October 6, 1973, as synagogues in Israel observe d Yom Kippur, the Jewish Day of Atonement, Syrian MiG)21’s attacked a group of I sraeli jets. Egypt, Syria, Jordan, and eight other Arab nations had mobilized against Israel. Egypt attacked the Sinai Peninsula with 4,000 tanks, knocking out many Israe li tanks; while Syria attacked the Golan Heights with 1,200. New Soviet)made SAM)6 mis siles plucked Israeli planes out of the sky with ease. However, within a few days, t he tide was turned. Israel regained control of the Heights, and took a large part of Sy ria. On October 12, they were only 18 miles from Damascus. With 12,000 soldiers, and 200 tanks, they swept across the Suez Canal in two directions to surround the Egyptian Th ird Army, which had been caught on the east side, and came within 12 miles of Cairo. Since the first day of the war, Russia had been air lifting supplies to the Arabs, so to counter that move, the United States said they inte nded to supply Israel “with whatever it needs.” Once Israel began smashing their way to victory, Russia sent a Naval force of 71 ships, including 16 submarines, to the Mediterra nean, and put their seven airborne divisions on full alert. On October 12th, the Chairmen of Exxon, Texaco, Mob il, and Chevron (who made up the production company of Aramco in Saudi Arabia ), sent Chief of Staff Gen. Alexander Haig (who later became Reagan’s Secretary of State) a memo warning against any increased aid to Israel, by saying it w ould “have a critical and adverse effect on our relations with the moderate Arab producing c ountries.” On October 17th, Omar Saqqaf, the Foreign Minister of Saudi Arabia, gave President Nixon a letter from King Faisal, which said that if the U.S. did not discont inue their shipment of military supplies to Israel within two days, there would be an embarg o. Nixon stated that he was committed to supporting Israel.

As the Israeli counterattack continued, Egypt and S yria were in serious trouble, and Russia urged the UN to call a ceasefire. Jim Akins, the ambassador to Saudi Arabia sent a message to Aramco that the oil embargo would not be lifted “unless the political struggle is settled in a manner satisfactory to the Arabs.” Two days later, the Saudis requested from the Aramco directors, information co ncerning the amount of oil used by the U.S. military, which they supplied. The Saudis then instructed them to stop all supplies to the military. In December, OPEC announc ed a price of $11.65 a barrel, and the result was economic chaos in the United States and Western Europe. Though Aramco claimed that they had no choice in wh at they did, and that they weren’t acting as agents of a foreign government ag ainst the United States, the cry went out that the oil industry was putting “profits before patriotism.” Before the embargo, America was importing 1.2 million barrels oil a day ; and by February, only 18,000 barrels, which was a drop of 98%. The rush was on t o reallocate other sources of oil (Venezuela and Iran had not joined the boycott), an d to distribute it throughout the world. The global emphasis of the American oil comp anies were revealed, when they refused to favor the U.S. at the expense of the oth er countries, causing us to lose a higher percentage of the available oil supply. In Egypt, Sadat’s terms for a ceasefire, was that I srael had to withdraw from all territories that it had won during the 1967 war; th us pressure from the United States and the Soviets, forced Israel to turn their victory in to a negotiated compromise. Anwar Sadat To add insult to injury, when the winter was at its worst during the shortage, the announcement that oil companies were experiencing r ecord profits, left a very sour taste in the mouths of Americans. Exxon announced t hat their third quarter profits were up 80% over the previous year, while Gulf was up 91 %. Exxon ended up the year with a profit that was an all)time record for any company, in any industry.

In 2002, Shell Oil acquired a couple of Texaco’s in terests. In 1998, Exxon (Esso, Standard Oil of New Jersey) merged with Mobil (Soco ny, Standard Oil of New York) to become ExxonMobil, the biggest oil company in the c ountry, and third largest company in the U.S. In 1987 British Petroleum purchased the remaining 45% of Sohio (Standard Oil of Ohio) that they didn’t already own, then in 1998, merged with Amoco (Standard Oil of Indiana), and in 2000 merged with Arco (Atla ntic Richfield). The Seven Sisters are now the Four Sisters, so what you have now is an expanded amount of power and influence that is concentrated in less hands, as oil companies have sought to consolidate their interests because of economic concerns. It’s uncanny in that it has happened in less than 20 years. It’s almost as if the old Standard Oil Company was coming back together. In 2001, Conoco ( Continental Oil) and Phillips Petroleum (Phillips 66) merged, to make ConocoPhill ips, the 3rd largest oil company, the 12th largest company, and the 6th largest oil company in the world. If this trend continues, it will make it all the more easier for oil companies to manipulate and control a crucial commodity like gasoline and oil. CLUB OF ROME This think)tank of Anglo)American financiers, scien tists, economists, politicians, heads of state, and industrialists from ten differe nt countries, met in April, 1968 at Rockefeller’s private estate in Bellagio, Italy, at the request of Aurelio Peccei, the Italian industrialist who had close ties to Fiat and the Ol ivetti Corporation. He claimed to have solutions for world peace and prosperity, which cou ld be accomplished through world government.

And since intellectual enlightenment is without effect if it is not also political, The Club of Rome also will encourage the creation of a world fo rum where statesmen, policy) makers, and scientists can discuss the dangers and hopes for the future global system without the constraints of formal intergover nmental negotiation.” For the most part, the Club (main office at 193 Ris sener Landstr. In Hamburg, Germany) functions as a research institute on econo mic, political, and social problems, and claim that “there is no other viable alternativ e to the future survival of civilization than a new global community under a common leadersh ip.” Their website claims: “The Club of Rome’s mission is to act as a global c atalyst of change that is free"},{"pageNumber":545,"pageContent":"of any political, ideological or business interest.

Just like how the proposals suggested by the Bilderberge rs seem to gain acceptance, we have to worry that the same thing will happen with the COR. On September 17, 1973, they released a Report calle d the “Regionalized and Adaptive Model of the Global World System,” which was prepared by Directors Mihajlo Mesarovic and Eduard Pestel (part of the “Strategy for Survival Project”), which revealed the Club’s goal of dividing the world into ten political/economic regions (which have been equated to the 10 “Kingdoms” of Bible pro phecy), which would unite the entire world under a single form of government. The se regions are: North America, Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Japan, Rest of Deve loped World, Latin America, Middle East, Rest of Africa, South and Southeast As ia, and China. The same plan was published in a Club of Rome book called Mankind at the Turning Point , which said: “The solution of these crises can be developed only in a global context with full and explicit recognition of the emerging world system and on a l ong)term basis. This would necessitate, among other changes, a new world econo mic order and a global resources allocation systemC” In 1976, they published RIO: Reshaping the International Order which called for a new international order, including an economic redi stribution of wealth.

AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome) has become a plague in our society, sprea ding to 91 nations. In the early 1990’s the U.S. News and World Report stated: “If there is not a cure for AIDS within the next thirteen years, tens of millions will die. ” Even though there has been a lot of talk about AIDS awareness and prevention, the full dange r of it has been covered)up by the Center for Disease Control, and the media, which ha s increasingly shown its pro) homosexual bias. In 1969, at a House Appropriations hearing, the Def ense Department’s Biological Warfare unit requested funds to develop, through ge ne)splicing, a new disease that would be resistant to treatment, and break down a v ictim’s immune system. They received $10 million (H.B. 15090), to produce “a sy nthetic biological agent, an agent that does not naturally exist and for which no natu ral immunity could have been acquired.” In the 1972 Bulletin of the UN’s World Health Organ ization (WHO), volume 47, page 251, it says: “An attempt should be made to see if viruses can in fact exert selective effects on immune function. The possibility should be looked into that the immune response to the virus itself may be impaired if the inflicting virus damages, more or less selectively, the cell responding to the virus.” Thi s sounds like the AIDS virus, so why is it being discussed by a health organization? Derivatives from sheep and cattle have been commonl y used to manufacture vaccines, however, certain viruses common to these animals can interact indefinitely,"},{"pageNumber":548,"pageContent":"forming a new strain of deadly viruses called retro )viruses. In 1974, the National Academy of Sciences recommended that “Scientists th roughout the world join with members of this committee in voluntarily deferring experiments (linking) animal viruses.” Dr. Robert Strecker, a practicing gastroenterologis t, with a Ph.D. in pharmacology, who was hired as a consultant to work on a health)care proposal for Security Pacific Bank, said: “I don’t think there is any doubt that AIDS i s a man)made problem. The question is whether it was created either accidentally or inten tionally. I believe the AIDS virus was requested, predicted, produced, and deployed.” The most common theory about the origin of AIDS was that it came from green monkeys in Africa. Yet several virologists have sai d that the AIDS virus does not occur naturally in any animal. Besides, it would have bee n statistically impossible to reach the point we are at now, just from a single episode. If the AIDS virus had originated with the monkeys, then the disease would have surfaced with the Pygmies, who are closer to them, and use them as a food source, yet, it appear ed first in the cities. Further damaging evidence comes from the fact that AIDS pra ctically occurred simultaneously in the United States, Haiti, Brazil, and Central Af rica. Strecker’s research indicated that the AIDS virus ( code)named ‘MKNAOMI’) was developed by the Frederick Cancer Research Facility of the National Cancer Institute, in cooperation with the WHO, in their laboratories at Fort Detrick, Maryland (which until 1969 was part of the U.S. Army’s germ warfare unit, known as the Army Infectious Disease Unit, or Special Operations Division); by c ombining bovine (cow) leukemia virus and visna (sheep) virus, and injecting them i nto human tissue cultures. The bovine leukemia virus is lethal to cows, but not to humans ; and the visna virus is deadly to sheep, but not to man. However, when combined, they produce a retro)virus that can change the genetic composition of the cells that th ey enter. He said: “If one analyzes the genes of the human AIDS virus and the genes of the bovine leukemia virus of cattle and the visna virus of she ep, and compares them, the genes appear related. How is it possible that the b ovine visna virus) which looks like AIDS and produces an AIDS)like disease, and wh ich produced pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in chimpanzees in 1972) has not b een analyzed and compared with AIDS ... until 1987 when ‘Characterization and Molecular Cloning of Bovine Lente (Latin for ‘slow’) Virus Related to Human Imm unodeficiency Virus’ was published in Nature magazine. Matthew Gonda, the author, described a v irus that looks like AIDS, named bovine visna virus, and sugg ested that it was most closely related to AIDS and may well be its precurs or.” On August 11, 1988, Ted Strecker, Dr. Strecker’s br other was found shot to death in his home in Springfield, Missouri. His death was ru led a suicide. On September 22, 1988, Illinois State Representative Douglas Huff of Chicago was found dead in his home. The autopsy revealed that he died of a stroke as a result of an overdose of cocaine and heroin. Rep. Huff just happened to be a very vocal supporter of Dr. Strecker’s work to publicize the AIDS cover)up. Coi ncidence or conspiracy? There was a vaccination program for Smallpox in Afr ica by the WHO.

On May 11, 1987, the London Times ran an"},{"pageNumber":549,"pageContent":"article called “Smallpox Vaccine ‘Triggered AIDS Vi rus’,” written by Science Editor Pearce Wright, who linked the mass vaccination prog ram of the World Health Organization in the 1970’s to the outbreak of AIDS, because Central Africa was the focus of the program, and they have become the most affected area in the world. Though in Africa, AIDS is generally regarded as a h eterosexual disease, in the United States, it has the stigma of being a ‘gay’ d isease. Prior to 1978, there was no sign of the AIDS virus here, yet in 1978, the kille r disease struck with a vengeance within the homosexual community. The evidence point s to the introduction of an experimental Hepatitis B vaccine. In 1969, Dr. W. S chmugner, a Polish physician, who was educated in Russia, came to the United States, where he became head of the New York City Blood Bank. He set up guidelines for a He patitis vaccine study, and only promiscuous males between the ages of 20 and 40 wer e included in the study, which has led some to believe that this was how the virus was introduced into the gay population. In 1978, more than 1,000 non)monogamous gay adult m ales received an experimental vaccination against Hepatitis B, which was sponsored by the National Institute of Health and the Center for Disease Cont rol. With the Hepatitis vaccine, which is not produced from a human tissue culture, it is impossible to have an accidental contamination, which seems to indicate that the AID S virus was intentionally put in the vaccine. In 1981, the Center for Disease Control re ported that 6% of those receiving the Hepatitis vaccine were infected with AIDS, but in 1 984, they admitted that it was actually 64%. These Hepatitis vaccine studies are now in the possession of the Justice Department in Washington, DC. To allow the disease to become entrenched within th e population, various facts were covered)up and glossed)over. A great deal of emphas is had been put on the prime cause of AIDS infection, being the exchange of body fluid, through sexual activity and intravenous drug use, which has brought a campaign for the importance of using clean, unused needles, and condoms. The use of a condom do es not guarantee protection against the transmission of the AIDS virus. All it takes is one AIDS virion (a complete virus particle with its outer coat intact), and the smallest sperm is 500 times larger that one such virion. In addition, the quality of condom s have become highly suspect, since failure rates of 30)50% have been reported. The risk of casual contact has been played down whe n in fact AIDS is a highly contagious disease which demands that a quarantine be placed on those who suffer from the disease. Rather than treat the disease as the epidemic it is, the government has concerned itself with giving AIDS carriers more rights and more exposure to the general population. There is concrete medical evide nce that indicates that the virus can survive up to 7 days on a dry petri dish, and up to 15 days, in an aqueous (wet) environment. This raises the question, what would h appen if an AIDS carrier would sneeze into a punch bowl or a salad bowl. It can in cubate 10)15 years before causing any noticeable signs of illness, which means that s exual relations exposes you to every sexual contact your partner has had in that period of time. A February, 1985 report in the British medical jour nal Lancet , said: “There is little evidence for homosexual activity among African AIDS patients (and it) appears to be transmitted through heterosexual contact or exposur e to blood through insect bites...” On September 9, 1985, a research team of researcher s from the National Cancer"},{"pageNumber":550,"pageContent":"Institute, the Laboratory of Tumor Cell Biology and the Institute of Tropical Medicine, said that “human retroviruses could be transmitted by mosquitoes or within the parasite itself.” In a report published in the October, 1981 , issue of Science , Boston hematologist Dr. Jerome Groopman, and researchers with the Natio nal Institute of Health said that recovery of the AIDS virus “from saliva suggests th at direct contact with this body fluid should be avoided...” On January 11, 1985, the Center for Disease Control reported: “There is a risk of infecting others by ... exposure of others through oral)genital contact or intimate kissing (‘french’ kissing).” Dr. Richard Restak, a Washingt on neurologist, made this statement: “At this point live AIDS virus has been isolated fr om blood, semen, serum, saliva, urine and now tears. If the virus exists in these f luids, the better part of wisdom dictates that we assume the possibility that it can also be transmitted by these routes. It seems reasonable, therefore, that AIDS v ictims should not donate blood or blood products, should not contribute to s emen banks, should not donate tissues or organs to organ banks, should not work as dental or medical technicians, and should probably not be employed as food handlers.” Richard Restak Professor William Haseltine of the Harvard Medical School, in a presentation to a University audience, said that anyone “who tells yo u categorically that AIDS is not contracted by saliva is not telling you the truth. AIDS may in fact be transmissible by tears, saliva, bodily fluids, and mosquito bites.” "},{"pageNumber":551,"pageContent":" William Haseltine AIDS is an epidemic that will not be stopped. The s cientists that created this deadly virus, have created a virus that multiplies 100 tim es faster than influenza. There are more than 180 different AIDS viruses, and 300 strai ns, which makes blood testing meaningless. The virus is constantly mutating, whic h makes it impossible to develop a general vaccine that would be effective with everyo ne. Quite simply, AIDS is a world) wide, modern)day plague, and every year, the number of those affected increases drastically. In the March, 1987 issue of Vanity Fair , Dr. William Grace, chief of Oncology at St. Vincent’s Hospital in New York, is quoted as saying: “I think AIDS is going to devastate the American medical system.” Besides not being able to combat it medically, the disease will progress to being an economic drai n, especially if national health care is instituted.” If its purpose was to glean out the population, it certainly will be successful. It must be assumed that the progenitors of this disease mus t have a measure of protection to prevent themselves from being exposed. The elite ha ve already segregated themselves from the general population by virtue of their posi tion, so from that aspect, there is little risk from being contaminated. In the event of medic al treatment, they have access to the best medical treatment that money can buy, and most likely possess a private, untainted blood supply. Somehow, I just can’t help thinking, that when their goal of limits to the population have been reached, how will they end the scourge which they have placed upon the earth. Just as the saying goes, tha t a lawyer in court doesn’t ask the witness a question that he doesn’t already have the answer for; the same reasoning would seem to apply here, that the I Iluminati would not unleash a disease that they didn’t already have a cure for. Bro. R. G. Stair, a well)known radio evangelist, ha d received an anonymous letter which seemed to confirm this theory. The writer cla imed to be a molecular biologist who worked in the same laboratory with Dr. Robert C. Ga llo (the molecular biologist noted for his involvement in the co)discovery of the AIDS virus). The writer claimed that there is an AIDS vaccine that is now available, and that 500,000,000 doses have been produced and is now available. Now the bombshell. T he writer accidentally discovered that Gallo had actually created the AIDS virus, and found a couple letters in his office, from high government officials which mentioned the New World Order.

It consisted of taking monkey v iruses that were harmless to humans, recombined them with DNA, RNA and enzymes f rom other animal viruses that were known to cause leukemias, lymphomas, and sarco mas; then got them to jump species, and cultured the new mutant viruses into h uman white blood cells in some studies, and in other studies) human fetal tissues, which produced an “immune)system destroying, cancer)causing viruses” for which “no n atural immunity could have been acquired, and no cure exists.” The scientist who wa s directing the tests was Dr. Robert Gallo. In 1975, Gallo and eight other scientists (working at the Bethesda Cancer Research Center in Maryland) had been working to modify the genetic structure of the virus so that it can be more easily transmitted. That same y ear, after Fort Detrick had become demilitarized, the newly established Frederick Canc er Research Facility was placed under the direction of the Bethesda Cancer Research Center, where Gallo was the Director. One investigation revealed that in March, 1976, a special federal government virus development program began producing the AIDS virus, and it was headed by Dr. Gallo and Dr. Novakhatskiy of the Ivanosku Institut e in Russia. Gallo would later be investigated and found guilty of scientific miscond uct, but President Clinton pardoned him. In response to the charges that AIDS was developed as a military biological warfare weapon, in February, 1987, Army Col.

Whether AIDS is the vehicle of elimination, that th e Club of Rome has referred to, or a precursor, just like Gulf War Syndrome, Ebola, an d SARS, is undoubtedly open to speculation, even in light of all the questions rai sed.

The funding for the first ($750,000) in 1980, producing North-South: A Program for Survival , was provided by the Dutch Government, as well as Denmark, Finland, India, Japan, Republic of Korea, Norway, S audi Arabia, Sweden, United Kingdom, the Commission of the European Communities , OPEC Special Fund, German Marshall Fund of the United States, the Ford Founda tion, Friedrich)Ebert and Friedrich) Naumann Foundations of the Federal Republic of Germ any, and the International Development Research Center of Canada. Subsequent funding was provided by the governments of Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, United Kingdom, and the OPEC Specia l Fund. The funding for the second phase ($350,000), which produced the 1983 report Common Crisis: North-South Cooperation for World Re covery , came from the governments of Canada, the Federal Republic of Germ any, the Netherlands, Kuwait, the Commission of the European Communities, and the German Marshall Fund of the United States. In short, the Brandt Reports “called for a full)sca le restructuring of the global economy,” and the purpose of the Commission was “to influence public opinion to help change government attitudes, as well as to make pro posals for revitalizing North)South negotiations.” In the 380)page report called North-South , which called for the “instant” redistribution of wealth from the richer, to poorer nations, and a stepping up of world disarmament."},{"pageNumber":555,"pageContent":"They wanted “greater power for the International Mo netary Fund and the World Bank.” Their rationale was that the “transfer of wealth mu st be tackled, not out of charity, but to ward off economic collapse ...

The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade was signed; and the Internatio nal Bank for Reconstruction and Development (World Bank) and International Monetary Fund were established. In the early 1960’s, the American economy began declining, and the international situation became unbalanced again. On August 15, 1971, Presid ent Nixon announced a new economic policy. The dollar was devalued, and its c onvertibility to gold was suspended. He initiated a 90)day wage price freeze, stimulativ e tax and spending cuts, and placed a temporary 10% tariff on most U.S. imports. Japan an d Western Europe were pressured into relaxing their trade barriers, in order to giv e the United States more access to them; and Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, and Taiwan were requested to decrease the flow of goods and textiles into the country. These moves offered relief to the country’s economic woes, but was an indication that Nixon was retreating from the global policies which were formulated during the 1960’s.

At the 1972 B ilderberger meeting, the idea was widely accepted, but elsewhere, it got a cool recep tion. According to Rockefeller, the organization could “be of help to government by pro viding measured judgment.”   David Rockefeller  Zbigniew B rzezinski Zbigniew Brzezinski, a professor at Columbia Univer sity, and a Rockefeller advisor, who was a specialist on international affairs, left his post to organize the group with Henry Owen (a Foreign Policy Studies Director with the Brookings Institution), George S.

Brzezinski was the author of the book Between Two Ages , which was published in 1970, in which he called f or a new international monetary system, and it was considered to be the ‘B ible’ of the Trilateralists. On page 72, he said: “Marxism is simultaneously a victory o f the external, active man over the inner, passive man and a victory of reason over bel ief.” He called for “deliberate management of the American future (pg. 260),” a “co mmunity of nations (pg. 296),” and a “world government (pg. 308).” He became its first Director (1973)76), drafted its Charter, and became its driving force.

Journalist Bill Moyers (a CFR member), wrote about the power of David Rockefeller in 1980: “David Rockefeller is the most conspicuous representative today of the ruling class, a multinational fraternity of men who shape the global economy and manage the flow of its capital ... Private citizen David Rocke feller is accorded privileges of a head of state ... He is untouched by customs or passport of fices and hardly pauses for traffic lights.” In his 1979 book Who’s Running America? , Thomas Dye said that Rockefeller was the most powerful man in America.

Be cause of a heavy cross)membership, some researchers have said that they appear to be a n inner circle of the Council on Foreign Relations (and also have ties to the Atlant ic Institute for International Affairs, which was established in 1961 as “a sort of public arm of NATO”), and represent a union of experts and transnational elite from the t hree noncommunist industrial regions of the world: North America, Japan, and Western Eur ope (excluding Austria, Greece, and Sweden). Rockefeller saw the need for such a pr ivate consultation among these three democratic areas. With the demise of the Bret ton Woods system, they believed an overhaul was needed. The theory was, that America’s role should be diminished, and made equal to the Common Market and Japan, because together, the three represented 70% of the world’s trade. In 1973, David Rockefeller met with 27 heads of sta te, including representatives from the Soviet Union and China; and in 1974, had a meeting with Pope Paul VI, who afterward called for the nations to form a world go vernment. A Trilateral Commission Task Force Report, presente d at the 1975 meeting in Kyoto, Japan, called An Outline for Remaking World Trade and Finance , said: “Close Trilateral cooperation in keeping the peace, in managing the w orld economy, and in fostering economic development and in alleviating world pover ty, will improve the chances of a smooth and peaceful evolution of the global system. ” Another Commission document read: “The overriding goal is to make the world saf e for interdependence by protecting the benefits which it provides for each country aga inst external and internal threats which will constantly emerge from those willing to pay a price for more national autonomy. This may sometimes require slowing the pa ce at which interdependence proceeds, and checking some aspects of it. More fre quently however, it will call for checking the intrusion of national government into the international exchange of both economic and non)economic goods.” In other words, t hey were promoting world government by encouraging economic interdependence among the superpowers. This little)known organization is actually controll ed by the Rockefellers, who oversee its activities and provide guidance for their polic ies. Their membership consists of over 300 members (with membership ceilings of 107 from N orth America, 150 from Western Europe, and 117 from Pacific)Asian), is made up of top bankers, industrialists, businessmen, labor leaders, scholars, politicians, senators, and governors.

We are intellectual prostitutes.” David Rockefeller said in a Saturday Evening Post article he wrote to defend his group: “My point is that far from being a coterie o f international conspirators with designs on covertly ruling the world, the Trilatera l Commission is, in reality, a group of concerned citizens interested in fostering greater understanding and cooperation among international allies.” However, those who have pene trated the inner workings of the organization, say the real purpose of the Commissio n is to take over all key policy) making positions in the government. Antony Sutton w rote in the Trilateral Observer that the Trilateralists have rejected the U.S. Constitut ion and the democratic political process; and their objective is to obtain the wealt h of the world for their own use, under the guise of “public service,” and to have, ultimat ely, a one)world socialist government, with them in control. Conservative critics claim the “Commission constitu tes a conspiracy seeking to gain control of the U.S. Government to create a new worl d order.” Mike Thompson, Chairman of the Florida Conservative Union, said: “ It puts emphasis on interdependence, which is a nice euphemism for one) world government.” The John Birch Society suspects them of being radical infilt rators of the government.

The July, 1977 issue of Atlantic Monthly reported: “Although the Commission’s primary concern is economic, the Trilateralists pin pointed a vital political objective: to gain control of the American Presidency.” The autho r of the article, Jeremiah Novak, said: “For the third time in this century, a group of American schools, businessmen, and government officials is planning to fashion a new w orld orderC” and that they had achieved one of their objectives, which was to “gai n control of the American Presidency.” Craig S.

In his book Why Not the Best , Carter said: “Membership on this Commission has provided me with a splendid lea rning opportunity, and many other members have helped me in my study of foreign affai rs.” Carter’s membership in the organization was the only foreign policy experience he had, and that was limited to attending a couple of conferences in Europe and Jap an. Congressman John Anderson, himself a member, said that Carter became a member just to improve his image. Carter’s indoctrination made him a willing pawn in furthering the goals of the Trilateral Commission. In a personal letter to the Commission, who was meeting in Tokyo, Japan, in January, 1977, he wrote: “We share economic, pol itical, and security concerns that make it logical we should seek ever increasing coop eration and understanding. And this cooperation is essential not only for our three reg ions, but in the global search for a more just and equitable world order.” "},{"pageNumber":577,"pageContent":" John B.

There might then be a redra fting of the basic law, and, if so, then it might be that this model we have worked out over a number of years might be taken into account.” The new Constitution calls for the S tates to be divided into Ten Federal Regions, called Republics, which would be “subservi ent departments of the national government.” The document contains no guarantees of freedoms tha t we now have under the Bill of Rights (Article I, Part A, Section 1: “Freedom o f expression shall not be abridged except in declared emergency”). In an emergency, t he government will have the power to curtail communication, movement, and the right t o assemble. It calls for public education, and gun control (Article I, Part B, Sect ion 8 “The bearing of arms or the possession of lethal weapons shall be confined to p olice, members of the armed forces, and those licensed under the law”). The President w ill serve one 9)year term (Article VI, Part B, Section 9, Subsection 8: “To assist in the maintenance of world order and, for this purpose, when the President shall recommend, t o vest jurisdiction in international legislative, judicial and administrative agencies.” ), and there will be two Vice)Presidents. A hundred Senators will be appointed by the Preside nt for lifetime terms, not elected; and there would be 400 members in the House of Repr esentatives. Each of the 100 Congressional Districts will elect three for a thre e year term; and 100 will be elected by the entire country, to serve a nine year term, and only they can become Committee Chairmen. With the completion of the proposed Newstates Const itution, Vice President Nelson Rockefeller, president of the U.S. Senate, develope d support for the introduction of HCR 28, which called for an unlimited Constitutiona l Convention in 1976. Swift public opposition soundly defeated this attempt, so the Co nvention supporters then went to the states promoting a “limited convention for the purp ose of adding a balanced budget"},{"pageNumber":608,"pageContent":"amendment.” They were able to convince 32 of the re quired 34 states to pass resolutions calling for a convention. The last stat e to sign on was Missouri in 1983, but after that, the legislatures in three states (Alaba ma, Florida and Louisiana) realized the consequences of their actions and rescinded their c all. It is ironic, but organizations claiming to be “con servative,” seem to be the strongest supporters for a convention. Most notable are: Amer ican Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), National Taxpayers’ Union (NTU), Republican National Committee (RNC), and the Committee on the Constitutional System (CCS). In 1992, Ross Perot, who had become a political for ce to be reckoned with, publicly called for a Constitutional Convention. In guest ap pearances with Barbara Walters, Phil Donahue and Larry King he stated that we needed a P arliamentary Government, and pledged that “his people” could get the remaining s tates needed for a Constitutional Convention call “in their sleep.” Ross Perot Another threat to our Constitution was the Conferen ce of States (COS). It was being peddled as a movement for the states to come togeth er and discuss the need to balance the relationship between the states, and th e federal government, in a “co)equal partnership,” even though our original Constitution intended for the States to be sovereign, and for the federal government to only h ave limited powers. Their first meeting was to be held in Annapolis (MD ), July 6)9, 1995, with a historical reenactment of the 1786 Annapolis convention; and t he second had been planned for October 24)26, 1995 (which, ironicaIly, was the 50t h anniversary of the establishment of the UN), in Philadelphia (PA), a reenactment of the 1787 convention. It was being funded by three private organizations which are ass ociated with the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations (ACIR): C ouncil of State Governments (CSG, established in 1930 with funding from a Rocke feller Grant), National Governors Association (NGA), and the National Conference of S tate Legislatures (NCSL, established in 1933 with funding from a Rockefeller Grant). In December of 1994 the NCSL had a meeting in North Carolina where state legislators were told the Conference of States was a way for States to keep the federal government from encroaching on their sovereignty.

According to Michael Leavitt, the Republican govern or of Utah, the goal of the Resolution’s proponents was to have 26 states pass it, although Governor Nelson of Nebraska was pressing for 34, which was the exact n umber of States needed to call for a Constitutional Convention. Leavitt, a member of the ACIR, told the Salt Lake City Tribune in 1994, that he wanted a constitutional convention. In a May, 1994 Position Paper, he said that our government was “...outdated and old fashioned ... n ot suited for the fast)paced, high) tech, global)marketplace we are entering. There is a better way,” The “better way” he suggested, seemed to be an end)run around the Const itution; because the COS literature indicated their interest in passing Cons titutional amendments. He indicated his high expectations for what the meeting could accomp lish: “Congress tried to limit the convention’s authority by stating it would meet ‘for the sole and express purpose of revising the Articles o f Confederation ... As we all know, the delegates to the great Constitutional Con vention in 1787 in Philadelphia did much more than that. They threw ou t the Articles of Confederation and drafted a new constitution.” Michael Leavitt Though Article V of the Constitution indicates that two)thirds of the States must vote for a constitutional convention before Congress cou ld call one, the COS was planning to use the same method the delegates did at the Annapo lis convention in 1786. Within ten years, the Constitution that was originally drafted on June 12, 1776 (and fully ratified by 1781), was no longer able to meet the needs of a gr owing nation. The delegates of Virginia, New York, Delaware, New Jersey, and Penns ylvania, meeting in Annapolis were charged with the task of amending the Articles of Confederation, and were to meet in Philadelphia “for the sole and express purpose o f revising” them. The need for a stronger central government was expressed, one that didn’t limit States rights. However, upon meeting in Philadelphia in May, 1787, they loc ked all the doors, and posted armed guards; and even closed all the windows, so they co uld deliberate in secret while they actually set up a new national government. Neither the Congress or the people could"},{"pageNumber":610,"pageContent":"stop them. Their work was finished on September 17, 1787 (and was fully ratified on May 29, 1790), and the Constitution of the United S tates was born, and is still in existence today. Many people were worried about this Conference of S tates, because nobody was really sure what could happen. Charles Duke, the Re publican state senator from Colorado, said that the COS would be the “edge of t he sword that knocks the head off the Constitution.” Case law mandates that members of a constitutional convention must be directly elected by the people, so they can act as their rep resentatives to exercise the sovereign power of the state. Each state delegation to the CO S would consist of the governor, and two leaders from each party in the state legislatur e (plus two alternates, one from each party), and therefore could be empowered with the n ecessary legal status as representatives of the people, should the decision be made to turn the meeting into a constitutional convention. Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich (R)GA), and 33rd Degree Mason Bob Dole (R) KS) openly supported the COS, and on March 24, 1995, Republican senators Hank Brown (CO) and Jesse Helms (NC) sponsored a Senate Resolution which would give Congressional authorization to transform the COS in to a bonafide Constitutional Convention. They maintained that without this Congr essional approval, it would be in conflict with Article 1, Section 10 of the Constitu tion, which does not allow any agreements between States.

However, the same forces behind this movement planned to have a “federalism summit” in C incinnati on October 22 with the support of the Council of State Governments, Nation al Governors Association and the National Conference of State Legislators. It is obvious that the I Iluminati had taken a two)prong approach to regiona l government. They have been working within the confi nes of the Executive Branch to get various Executive Orders passed; and they have also used their various finger organizations to study our existing constitution, a nd recommend changes. All of their efforts may eventually culminate in a call for a Co nstitutional Convention that will spell the end of democracy as we know it in this country. CREATING A CRISIS Certain questions raised during the 1973 Oil Embarg o, seem to point to the fact that the crisis was created by the I Iluminati, as a test, to see what it would be like without gasoline for automobiles, and fuel for heating home s. During the Embargo, Maine’s Governor, Democrat Kenn eth M. Curtis, accused the Nixon Administration of “creating a managed oil sho rtage to force support of its energy programs.” A 1973 study by Philadelphia Inquirer reporters Donald Bartlett and James B. Steele, revealed, that while American oil compan ies were telling the U.S. to curtail oil consumption, through a massive advertising campaign , the five largest oil companies (Exxon, Mobil, Texaco, Gulf, and Standard Oil of Ca lifornia) were selling close to two barrels overseas, for every barrel (42 gallons) of oil sold here. They accused the oil companies and the Federal government of creating th e crisis. In 1974, Lloyd’s of London, the leading maritime insurance company in t he world, said that during the three months before the Embargo, 474 tankers left the Mid dle East, with oil for the world. During the three months at the height of the crisis , 492 tankers left those same ports. During the Embargo, Atlantic Richfield (ARCO, whose President, Thornton Bradshaw was a member of the CFR) drivers were hauling exces s fuel to storage facilities in the Mojave desert. All of this evidence points to the c onclusion that there was no oil shortage in 1973."},{"pageNumber":612,"pageContent":"Antony C. Sutton wrote in Energy: The Created Crisis : “Our mythical energy shortage can be dismissed with a few statistics. Th e U.S. consumes about 71 quads (a ‘quad’ is one quadrillion BTU’s, or 10 to the 15th power British Thermal Units) of energy per year. There is available now in the U.S., exclu ding solar sources and without oil and gas imports, about 151,000 quads. Consequently, we have sufficient energy resources to keep us functioning at our present rate of consu mption for about 2,000 to 3,000 years– without discovering new reserves. Even at hi gher consumption rates there will be no problem in the next millennium” Antony C. Sutton In 1977, independent petroleum companies discovered 88% of the new oil fields, drilling on 81% of those. They have been hampered b y the large corporations, referred to earlier as the Seven Sisters, who wanted to avoi d adding to our national supply so they can profit from the higher prices. Carter’s De partment of Energy was established to perpetuate the propaganda of the existence of an en ergy crisis. In 1975, an anonymous ARCO official told Hugh M. Ch ance, a former State Senator from Colorado, that the Government had allowed only one pool of oil in a 100 square mile area on Alaska’s North Slope, to be developed, even though the entire area north of Brooks Range has so much oil, that if it were dr illed, “in five years the United States could be totally energy free, and totally independe nt from the rest of the world as far as energy is concerned.” The Prudhoe Bay oil field is one of the richest oil fields on earth, able to produce an oil flow for at least 20 years, without the need of a pump; and a natural gas supply which could supply the entire co untry for 200 years. However, the Government wouldn’t allow it to be pumped out, and it is funneled back into the ground. The Gull Island find had a different chemical struc ture, as did the Kuparuk oil field, west of there, which meant that the three different chem ical compositions indicated the existence of separate pools of oil on the North Slo pe in an area of 50,000 square miles. Needless to say, this seems to be an almost unlimit ed supply of domestic oil. Another ARCO official told Lindsey Williams, a chap lain for the work camps on the Trans)Alaska Oil pipeline, that “there will never b e an energy crisis (because) we have as much oil here as in all Saudi Arabia.” Williams had witnessed a huge oil discovery at Gull Island (5 miles north of Prudhoe Bay in the Be aufort Sea) that could have produced so much oil, that the official said that another pi peline could be built “and in another"},{"pageNumber":613,"pageContent":"year’s time we can flood America with oil) Alaskan oil ... and we won’t have to worry about the Arabs.” However, a few days after the fin d, the Federal Government ordered the documents and technical reports locked up, the well capped, and the rig withdrawn. Their excuse was that an oil spill in that part of the Arctic Ocean would kill various micro)organisms. Williams felt that the U.S. Govern ment was deliberately creating an oil crisis, and delaying the flow of oil, in order to b ankrupt the oil companies, which would lead to the nationalization of oil and gas. William Brown, Director of Technological Studies at the Hudson Institute, said: “The President (Carter) said there is no chance of us be coming independent in our oil supplies. That is just wrong. We have at least 100 years of petroleum resources in this country.” In 1976, proven resources were set at 37 billion barrels and the estimated recoverable resources were set at 150 billion barre ls. This is about a 50)year supply at current usage levels. The American Petroleum Instit ute said in their 1977 Annual report, that recoverable crude was set at 30.9 billion barr els, and with today’s technology, the amount of recoverable crude was 303.5 billion barre ls, which is about an 80)year supply. The 1968 U.S. Geological Survey reported th at the crude oil potential of the Atlantic Ocean continental shelf area is 224 billio n barrels, the Gulf of Mexico has 575 billion barrels, the Pacific Coast has 275 billion barrels, and Alaska has 502 billion barrels, which is a grand total of 1,576 billion ba rrels. Only about 2% of these areas have been leased, which at the time of the report, had yielded 615 million barrels of oil, and 3.8 TCF (trillion cubic feet) of natural gas ye arly. The Wall Street Journal said that we possessed “1001 years of natural gas. ” Only about 2% of the Outer Continental Shelf has been le ased, even though it may contain over half of our potential natural gas reserves. Al ong the Atlantic Coast, there is a potential of 67 TCF of gas, yet only about a dozen wells had been drilled in those areas. The Potential Gas Committee said in 1972, that we h ad 1412 TCF in reserve; in 1973, Mobil said we had 758 TCF; Exxon said we had 660)13 80 TCF; the U.S. Geological Survey reported in 1974, that we had 761)1094 TCF i n reserve; the National Academy of Sciences said in 1974, that we had 885 TCF; and there were other reports which indicated that we had over 700 TCF. These sources d id not include the unconventional sources of coalbeds, shale formations, “tight sand” formations, and deep underground water areas. From conventional sources, our known reserves were estimated to be about 237 TCF, and underground reserves were estimated to be about 530 TCF. An analysis of unconventional resources indicated the following yi eld: tight sand (600 TCF), coal (250 TCF), shale (500 TCF), underground water zones in t he Gulf (200 TCF), and synthetic gas from peat (1443 TCF). This all adds up to a tot al of 3,800 TCF of natural gas, and with the U.S. using an average of 21 TCF a year, th at would be enough to provide us with another 100 years worth of energy. That doesn’ t take into account the synthetic gas obtainable from growing marine bio)mass, such as th e California Giant Kelp (Macrocystis Pyrifera), which grows two feet per da y, and could be a renewable source for the production of synthetic gas. It is also estimated that the United States could h ave up to half of the world’s known recoverable coal reserves, which could be about 200 billion tons– 45 billion of which is near the surface. At the time of this report, maxim um production up to 1985 would have only used 10% of this reserve, even if no new reser ves were discovered. In 1979,"},{"pageNumber":614,"pageContent":"Herbert Foster, Vice)President of the National Coal Association, said: “America has three trillion tons of coal out there, ready to be mined ... all we produced last year was 590 million tons. That’s only one pound of coal for every 2)1/2 tons still in the ground. The U.S. Geological Survey has estimated our coal r eserves will last us well into the next century.” One reason coal development has been held up, is that 40% of all reserves are on land owned by the Federal Governmen t, and environmentally)minded citizens. The book The Next 200 Years by Herman Kahn and the Hudson Institute said: “Allowing for the growth of energy demand ... we co nclude that the proven reserves of these five major fossil fuels (oil, natural gas, co al, shale, and tar sands) alone could provide the world’s total energy requirements for a bout 100 years, and only one)fifth of the estimated potential reserves sources could prov ide for more than 200 years of the projected energy needs.” The Hudson Institute said in 1974: “There is no shortage of energy fuels.” Antony Sutton wrote: “The energy ‘cr isis’ is a phony, a rip)off, a political con game designed to perpetuate a ‘crisis’ that can be ‘managed’ for political power purposes.” Herman Kahn Conservative estimates indicate that we have 100 ye ars of energy sources available, while evidence of other undeveloped finds show that we have adequate reserves that would last long beyond that. The I Iluminati has a firm grip on the oil supply, and af ter their ‘test’ in 1973, its obvious that oil will be used as a weapon of control. One can only wonder what would happen to this country if a large )scale oil crisis occurred. Needless to say, it would be a disaster of unbelievable prop ortions that most likely would cause an economic collapse. Law and order would not exist in this scenario, as the population would fight among themselves for the limited resour ces that would be available, thus making the perfect situation for a World Government to step in. "},{"pageNumber":615,"pageContent":" RIOT AND REVOLUTION Revolution has always been the method used to facil itate change, and it would seem likely that an environment could be created that wo uld ultimately lead to a revolt by the citizens of this country. As our economy continues to decline, and it becomes harder for people to get by, there may be a ground swell of re volt across the country against the government, Of course, the I Iluminati has already planted these seeds. As you have read, the I Iluminati controls the leadership of the labor unio ns, and the corporate structure of America. Thus, a major strik e could cripple this country. For instance, a strike by the Longshoremen would preven t anything from being unloaded off the ships. A strike by the Teamsters would prevent anything from being shipped on trucks. A strike by the Air Traffic Controllers wou ld prevent all flights, except for military planes. Basically, with a major labor strike, nothi ng would move, and there would be no way to get food and other products of necessities t o the cities. Again, this would be a crucial blow to the economy. On top of that, and hi story has shown this, a major strike would most likely be accompanied with acts of viole nce and sabotage. Indeed, this situation would make it possible for the initiation of martial law, and a World Government to step in to maintain control. It is a known fact that revolution has been ferment ing in this country for a long time, and riots could be instigated through the many terr orist groups that exist here. Riots, bank robberies, racial confrontations, skyjackings, strikes, demonstrations, assassinations, and kidnappings, are not just unrel ated events, according to J. Bernard Hutton, who wrote in his 1972 book The Subverters that the “increasing violence and terrorism is a direct result of an organized world) wide plot to destroy the Western democracies.” The first hint of revolution came from the Communis ts. Prominent U.S. Communist Gus Hall said at the 1961 funeral of Eugene Dennis, National Chairman of the U.S. Communist Party: “...slit the throats of Christian children and drag them over the mourner’s bench and the pulpit and allow them to dr own in their own blood.” As much as the Government would like us to believe it, Comm unism is not dead– only sleeping. When it awakes, most likely under the banner of Soc ialism, it will be a force to be reckoned with. The Communists, through their subver sive agents in this country, have maps of all strategic locations, such as military f irearm storage, police stations, fire stations, water hydrants, railroads and other trans portation centers, communication centers, and water reservoirs and supplies. It wasn ’t too long ago, that we discovered that Russia still has spies working within the CIA. Despite their overtures toward democracy, they are clearly continuing to follow an agenda to undermine the United States. "},{"pageNumber":616,"pageContent":"   Gus Hall  Eugene Denni s The riots could be racially motivated. Percy E. Sut ton, a former Borough President of Manhattan in New York City, who is Black, said in h is keynote address before the National Conference of Anti)Poverty Agencies at Col umbia University’s Teachers College on February 22, 1968, that there was a plan to use thousands of Black Veterans from the Vietnam War to wage war on Whites . He said: “I am afraid that the greatest battle of the era– of the Vietnam War– wil l not be fought in the demilitarized zone north of Da Nang, but will be fought in the st reets of America.” In April and May of 1992, after four policemen were acquitted in the be ating of a Black man, Rodney King, massive riots swept across south)central Los Angele s, and the military had to be sent in to restore order. It was reported that 600 building s were burned, and 52 people killed. Damage estimates ran as high as $1 billion. Inciden ts were also reported in Atlanta, Las Vegas, San Francisco, Miami, and Seattle. Even thou gh the Blacks in this country have achieved quite a bit in the past 30 years, the figh t against oppression has hardened them, and has created a generation that thinks noth ing of using the political power of violence and demonstration to make their views know n.

Jerry Rubin , who was a member of the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) at Kent Sta te University, said on July 20, 1970: “The first part of the Yippie program is to k ill your parents.

Police stations will blow up ... Revolutionaries will brea k into jails and free all prisoners ... The Youth International Revolution will begin w ith mass breakdown of authority, mass rebellion, total anarchy in every i nstitution in the Western World...” Jerry Rubin Jerry Kirk, a student at the University of Chicago, who was active in the Communist Party up to 1969, told the House and Senate Interna l Security Committees: “Young people have no conception of the conspiracy’ s strategy of pressure from above and pressure from below, so well outlined in Jan Kozak’s And Not A Shot Is Fired . They have no idea they are playing into the hands of the Establishment they claim to hate. The radicals think they are fig hting the forces of the super) rich, like Rockefeller and Ford, and don’t realize that it is precisely such forces which are behind their own revolution, financing it , and using it for their own purposes.” In his book, The Strawberry Statement: Notes of a College Revolu tionary , James S. Kunen (who in April, 1968, was one of the students who took over Columbia University) wrote: “In the evening we went up to the U. to check out a strategy meeting.

We were offered E sso (Standard Oil of New Jersey, Exxon– Rockefeller) money. They want us to make a lot of radical commotion so they can look more in the center as th ey move to the left.” Another radical threat has come from militant homos exuals. On September 19, 1993, at the Sunday evening service of the Hamilton Square Baptist Church in San Francisco, California, Rev. Lou Sheldon of the Trad itional Values Coalition was to be the scheduled speaker. Around 5:00 PM, homosexual d emonstrators began arriving, and by the time of the service at 6:00 PM, so many had shown up, that they completely controlled the area outside of the church and they attempted to prevent people from entering the church, including the pastor and his w ife. The protesters took down the Christian flag, and hoisted the Gay flag. Even thou gh the police were there, they did nothing, claiming that the situation was under cont rol. When the riot police finally were called in to force the gays out of the church court yard, the rioters moved to the emergency exit doors on the west side of the church where they “pounded and kicked the doors, seeking to break them down.” The noise w as so disturbing that the service had to be temporarily stopped. I heard a recording of this on a radio show, and needless to say, it was very unnerving. Lou Sheldon As the churchgoers left, they were shouted and curs ed at; and the speaker had debris thrown at him. A group of gay demonstrators were heard yelling: “We want your children! Give us your children!” Through it all, n ot one arrest was made, because the police were told that this was “an open public meet ing and not a worship service” and therefore “were not allowed to enforce the law rega rding the disturbance of church worship services.” Just like the civil rights movem ent of the 1960’s, this may have very well been the beginning of gays exercising militant action to gain rights to carry out their perversive lifestyle, especially now that inroads a re being made in regard to gay marriages. In a 1987 edition of Gay Community News this interesting bit of information was published: “We shall sodomize your sons C We shall seduce them in your schools, in your dormitories, in your gymnasiums, in your locker roo ms, in your sports arenas, in your seminaries, in your youth groups, in your movi e theater bathrooms, in your army bunkhouses, in your truck stops, in your all)m ale clubs, in your houses of"},{"pageNumber":619,"pageContent":"Congress, wherever men are with men together.

In 1965, the Department o f Justice established the Office of Law Enforcement Assistance to help the local police fight crime. In 1968, as part of the Crime Control Act, it became known as the Law Enfor cement Assistance Agency (LEAA). Charles H. Rogovin, an administrator of the LEAA, said in an October 1, 1969 speech to the International Association of Chiefs o f Police, meeting in Miami: “If local law enforcement fails, then something else will rep lace it. I do not raise the spectre of a federal police force merely to frighten you. Look a t the organized crime field. We now see a substantial federal effort there– and not sim ply because organized crime is interstate in nature. It is also because law enforc ement has failed to do its job.” The LEAA originally discussed the possibility of a Nati onal Police Force to be used in the event of a civil disturbance, for crowd dispersal a nd to neutralize revolutionary leadership. However, an article in the January 15, 1973 edition of the Boston Herald American talked about the “plans for reorganization, region alization and consolidation of police departments.” The Deputy Attorney General of California had said during a conference on Civil Emergency Management that “anyone who attacks the s tate, even verbally, becomes a revolutionary and an enemy by definition. They are the enemy and must be destroyed.” On December 30, 1975, after it was signed into law by Gov. Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown, Jr., the California National Guard announced that t hey were prepared to provide emergency assistance to any local police force in t he country. They introduced the 1,200 member Law Enforcement Assistance Force (LEAF ), which was a specially trained and equipped military police force to handl e mass disturbances and riots, which could be put into place within 12 hours. Although t hey were phased out in the mid) 1980’s it appeared that LEAF was the forerunner of a national police force. "},{"pageNumber":620,"pageContent":" Jerry Brown This national police force began taking shape throu gh the Multi)Jurisdictional Task Force (MJTF), a creation of the Department of Defen se, and is a joint operation of FEMA and the National Guard Bureau.

The MJTF was to be the coordinating body of t he BATF, FDA, CIA, DEA, IRS, Federal Marshals, National Guard, and local police organizations.

Army’s Office of Public Affairs announced that the Defense Department Authorization Act passed by Congress in 1987, initiated this new training, which was being carried out in military bases such as Fort Hood (TX), Fort Benning (GA), and Fort McClell an (AL). There have been reports of anti)terrorist training missions which have taken place throughout the country. Marines from the 22nd Marin e Expeditionary Unit at Camp Lejeune (NC), along with air support from the unmar ked black helicopters, carried out a late)night raid in July, 1993, on Tybee Island, nea r the mouth of the Savannah River. In early 1994, the Army and the Alaska State Police he ld a joint operation on the Kenai Peninsula, near Anchorage. In July, 1994, Marines f rom the 13th Marine Expeditionary Unit at Camp Pendleton (CA), held urban warfare tra ining in different locations around Sacramento. In October, 1994, Army Special Forces a nd the Detroit Police SWAT team, engaged in anti)terrorist training missions at a va cant 6)story apartment house on West Alexandrine Street, and at a group of abandoned hou ses in Van Buren Township, a suburb of Detroit, near the Willow Run Airport. A mock city was constructed in the northern area of Fort Polk, in Louisiana, one of the Joint Readiness Training Centers (there are oth ers in Fort Ord, CA and Fort Chaffee, AR), which was labeled a “Military Operati ons in Urban Terrain Complex” (MOUT). It is also the location of the North Americ an Training Center for the United Nations. Smaller MOUTs are located in Fort Drum (NY ) and Fort Indiantown Gap (PA), who have a model town called Johnson City that is u sed for urban warfare training. The FBI had established an anti)terrorist training comp ound at the abandoned Brown and Root, Inc. construction yard in Belie Chasse, Louis iana, just south of New Orleans. The purpose of this urban warfare training was nothing more than the perfection of “house) to)house searches and controls on the civilian popu lation,” which will be used to disarm the American people through force. It has been sugg ested that the UN operations in Somalia and Haiti were used as practice runs for di sarming the civilian population. However, before this can happen, a massive gun law will have to be passed, so that all the guns will be confiscated. In 1970, the FBI estimated that the private citizens of the country had a total of 90 million weapons, incl uding 35 million rifles, 31 million shotguns, and 24 million handguns (while the armed forces only had a small arms inventory of 4.8 million guns). Estimates in the ea rly 1990’s placed the number of registered handguns in this country at 70 million, and the number of unregistered at 50 million. The I Iluminati will not instigate any kind of uprising i f Americans will be able to defend themselves. Because of this, there has been a massive attack on our constitutional right “to keep and bear arms.” The extended waiting period mandated by the Brady B ill was only the beginning, there have been other Bills introduced in Congress to ban guns. Sen. Howard Metzenbaum said during a 1993 Senate hearing: “Unti l we can ban all of them, then we"},{"pageNumber":622,"pageContent":"might as well ban none.” He also said: “The best wa y to keep handguns out of the wrong hands is through licensing. Licensing is a ba rrier to gun crime.” At his Senate Confirmation Hearings in 1993, FBI Director Louis F reeh said: “The strongest gun legislation ... I will enforce diligently and exhau stively.” U.S. Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders said: “Handguns are a public health issue.” Senator Joseph Biden said: “(Banning guns) is an idea whose time has come.” Re p. Mel Reynolds said on CNN’s Crossfire: “If it were up to me we’d ban them all.” From the 1970’s to 1990’s the incidence of violent crimes have more than doubled. They have become more heinous– to the point of being repulsive, and the Government ’s view is to disarm the criminal, but also at the same time, they want to also disarm law abiding citizens.  Howard Metzenbaum  Louis Freeh  Jo ycelyn Elders   Joseph Biden  Mel Reynolds Bill Clinton (as quoted in USA Today , March 11, 1993, page 2A) said: “We can’t be so fixated on our desire to preserve the rights of ordinary AmericansC” "},{"pageNumber":623,"pageContent":" Bill Clinton The move for gun control is snowballing, and that i s part of their plan. In 1994, the National Rifle Association got their hands on a sec ret document which represented the blueprint for the gun)control lobby in this country . The first step was to use the media to create a clamor for gun control in this country, an d this would in turn sway the opinion of a large portion of the population to support such a measure. The second step would be the initiation of gun control legislation that woul d establish annual licensing fees, and surcharges on ammunition. After two years, the thir d step would involve a massive increase in the licensing fees. The reason given, w ould be because of the costs involved to enforce the law, when in fact, it would be to discourage ownership. The failure to get a license would result in a $1,000 f ine and/or six months in jail; and if your license lapses, your failure to turn your guns over to the government, would result in a $15,000 fine and/or eighteen months in jail. Both i nstances also result in the loss of the right to own a firearm. After two more years, the fourth step would call fo r further legislation to increase the licensing fees even more. Their ultimate goal “is t o reduce the number of licensees to zero.” In this way, the Second Amendment to the Con stitution of the United States will be circumvented in order to take the guns out of th e hands of the American people. After that, the population will be defenseless agai nst government forces. They hoped to accomplish this within 15 years. Noah Webster said in 1787: “Before a standing army or a tyrannical government can rule, the people must b e disarmed; as they are in almost every kingdom in Europe.” There was a law passed that tells us what the menta lity of the government is concerning this issue. On September 26, 1961, Publi c Law 87)297 or “The Arms Control and Disarmament Act” was signed. It created the U.S . Arms Control and Disarmament Agency as an “agency of peace to deal with the prob lem of reduction and control of armaments looking toward ultimate world disarmament .” Section 3(a) describes disarmament as the “control, reduction, or eliminat ion, of armed forces and armaments of all kinds.” Section 31(a) indicates that the Age ncy is to engage in study and research to achieve the “limitation, reduction, control, and elimination of armed forces and armaments...” This information can be found in the United States Code, Volume 9, Title 22 (Foreign Relations), Chapter 35 (Arms Control an d Disarmament), Sections 2551) 2595. Even though the Agency is active in negotiati ons regarding foreign policy, you can be sure that all such negotiations include the same concessions for America."},{"pageNumber":624,"pageContent":"In the February 14, 1963 edition of the Washington Report , Congressman James B.

The Disarmament legislation was passed for the purpose of implementing the Depa rtment of State Publication 7277, entitled Freedom from War - The United States Program for Ge neral and Complete Disarmament in a Peaceful World .” Will the U.S. military go against American citizens if so ordered by the Federal Government? It was reported that a 46)question surv ey was handed out in May, 1994, to “300 randomly selected” Marines (veterans of the Panama operation and the Persian Gulf War) at the Twentynine Palms Marine Corps Base in the Mohave Desert about 70 miles east of San Bernadino, California. The soldie rs were asked for their reaction to various statements, such as U.S. military troops be ing commanded by UN officers, whether the President “has the authority to pass hi s responsibilities as Commander)in) Chief to the UN Secretary)General,” and if they wou ld serve in a United Nations military force to “maintain world peace.” The survey was con cluded with this: “The U.S. Government declares a ban on the possession, sale, transportation, and transfer of all non)sporting firearms. A thirty (30) day amnesty pe riod is permitted for these firearms to be turned over to the local authorities. At the end of this period, a number of citizen groups refuse to turn over their firearms. Consider the following statement: I would fire upon U.S. citizens who refuse or resist confiscatio n of firearms banned by the U.S. Government.” After the news of this survey surfaced (in The Spotlight , and the November issue of American Legion Magazine ), it was later reported that it was part of a sold ier’s Master Thesis at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey , California, and did not “reflect any government program.” However, the February, 199 4 issue of Modern Gun magazine reported that a similar survey had been gi ven to some Navy SEALS. The Thesis, called Peacekeeping and UN Operational Control: A Study of Their Effect on Unit Cohesion , had been classified, until March, 1995, when it w as approved for public dissemination. In response to the questi on about swearing allegiance to the UN, 208 Marines said they could not do so (117 of t hose strongly disapproved), and 71 said they could (with 19 of those strongly approvin g). And, in regard to the infamous question 46, of the 264 Marines who responded, 185 said they would be opposed to firing at Americans (with 127 strongly opposing), a nd 79 said they would be willing to shoot if ordered (with 23 strongly affirming). So, the bottom line is, if ordered, one out of every four Marines would shoot American citizens. What this survey revealed was that, for the most pa rt, our military probably could not be relied on to act as a cohesive force to fire upo n the citizens of this country. However, with increased indoctrination, that could change, b ut I don’t think there is time for that. Therefore, the deck had to be stacked. On November 11, 1990, President George Bush signed an Executive Order that authorized the presence of UN Battle Groups in the U.S., and there are 15 reported to be here. Before leaving office, in a major speech t o the United Nations, Bush said that the United States would permit UN troops to use var ious military bases for “training purposes,” and “multi)national field exercises.” "},{"pageNumber":625,"pageContent":" George H.

On March 16, 1993, Senate Joint Resolution No. 65 called for the “establishment of a commission to study the creation of a standing international military force under the U nited Nations Charter.” In 1993, Clinton issued Presidential Review Directive (PRD) #13, supporting Boutros)Ghali’s (UN Secretary)General) proposal for a UN military force , substantially made up of Americans. However, Gen. Colin Powell, Commander of the Joint Chiefs of Staff insisted on a codicil that said, if any U.S. comman der believed his orders violated the U.S. Constitution, or placed our country or militar y forces at risk, the orders could be disregarded. On May 3, 1994, Clinton signed the Pre sidential Review Directive #25, which put U.S. military commanders under the author ity of the UN during UN military operations, and instructed the Department of Defens e to establish a U.S. military organizational structure which included the United Nations.

According to Clinton’s “Bridge to America” proposal, the purp ose of these partnerships was to “assist the participating nations’ transition to de mocratic military institutions with peacetime utility in providing military support of civilian authorities...” Troops who were attached to the Russian Interior Ministry were seen training with the U.S. 10th Special Forces Group, who were being reassigned to Fort Car son, Colorado.

On November 25, 1952, the Attorney General gave in to Hoover. In 1968, during the riots, a Congressional committe e stated that acts by ‘guerrillas’ in the United States was compared to being in a ‘state of war,’ and detention areas were discussed “for the temporary imprisonment of warrin g guerrillas.” Americans were concerned about this talk, and in 1971 Congress pas sed legislation that repealed the Emergency Detention Act of 1950. However, there was other legislation that provided for the existence of detention centers. In December, 1975, the Senate held hearings which r evealed the continuing plans for internment. The report “Intelligence Activities , Senate Resolution 21” revealed their secret agenda. The hearings revealed documents, mem os, and testimony by government informants which painted the picture of a government that wanted to monitor, infiltrate, arrest and incarcerate a segme nt of Americans. The existence of the Master Search Warrant (which a uthorized the FBI Director to “search certain premises where it is believed that there may be found contraband, prohibited articles, and other materials in violati on of the Proclamation of the President of the United States.”) and the Master Arrest Warra nt (by authorization of the U.S. Attorney General, the head of the FBI is empowered to “arrest persons who I deem dangerous to the public peace and safety.

Boeing 727 jet crashe d into a foggy mountain in northern Virginia, killing all 92 people onboard, a fter that, it was discovered that there was a secret government compound nearby called Moun t Weather. Mount Weather (Western Virginia Office of Controlle d Conflict Operations) is an 561 acre installation located about 48 miles (by air, a nd 54 via the roads) west of Washington, and 1,725 feet above sea level, near th e town of Bluemont (5 miles northeast), Virginia. As you drive on route 7, west of Leesburg, you’ll turn left on Route 601 just west of Bluemont, and that will lead you r ight to the gates (actual address is 19844 Blue Ridge Mountain Road). In case of an all) encompassing national emergency, a hand)picked list of civilian and military leaders will be taken to this huge underground shelter in order to form the nucleus of a postwar g overnment. It is run under the auspices of FEMA who refer to it as the “special fa cility,” but it is officially called the “Continuity of Government Program.” Mount Weather Mount Weather has been owned by the federal governm ent since 1902, when the 94 acre site was purchased by the U.S. Department of A griculture. President Coolidge even talked about building a summer White House the re. During World War I it was used as an artillery range, and then during the Dep ression it was used as a work farm for homeless people. The Bureau of Mines began usin g the site for experiments in 1936. Initiated by the Federal Civil Defense Admini stration (later known as the Federal Preparedness Agency), construction began in 1954, a nd was completed on 1959. Eisenhower told the director of Mt. Weather (code)n amed “High Point”): “I expect your people to save our government.” It was reported that Millard F. Caldwell, former go vernor of Florida, suggested that it be used as an alternate capital, because it was bel ieved that the fallout shelter beneath the East Wing of the White House (known as the Pres ident’s Emergency Operation Center) did not offer sufficient protection from a nuclear attack against Washington.

They will be taken to Mount Weather. It is named for the weather station that was former ly maintained on the mountain by the Department of Agriculture. The facility was con structed inside a mountain made of greenstone and striated granite, the 4th hardest rock known to man; the entrance is sealed with a door, similar to that of a bank vault , only much larger; and it is guarded around the clock. There are also about 65 primary b uildings on the surface that is part of this complex. There are 403 people there to take care of the needs of the 1,000 to 2,500 that work there everyday, around the clock. Richard Pollack, a reporter for Progressive Magazin e, in the mid)1970’s, interviewed a number of people who had been inside the man)made cavern, and revealed that it is an underground city with roads, sidewalks, office b uildings, cafeterias, dormitories, medical facilities, a television station, law enfor cement unit, fire department, and a battery)powered subway. It is illuminated with fluo rescent lighting. It has a spring)fed artificial lake (large enough for water skiing), it s own waterworks, a power plant, and one of the most sophisticated computer systems in t he world. It even has a chamber for members of Congress to meet. It can support a popul ation of 200 for up to 30 days, although it can accommodate up to 2,000 people. Onl y the President, his Cabinet, and the Supreme Court would have private sleeping quart ers. The President or the next in line of succession, wo uld take his place in an area there known as the White House. But until then, a FEMA of ficial is performing the function as Mount Weather is now performing the duties of a bac k)up United States Government. Pollack wrote: “High)level government sources, speaking under the promise of strict anonymity, told me that each of the federal departments (Agric ulture, Commerce, Health and Human Services, Housing and Urban Development, Inte rior, Labor, State, Transportation, and the Treasury) represented at Mo unt Weather is headed by a single person on whom is conferred the rank of a Ca binet)level official. Protocol even demands that subordinates address them as ‘Mr. Secretary.’ Each of the Mount Weather ‘Cabinet members’ is apparently appoi nted by the White House and serves an indefinite term. Many of the ‘Secreta ries’ have held their positions through several administrations.” There are also parallel versions of the Selective S ervice, the Veteran’s Administration, the Federal Communications Commissi on, the Post Office, the Civil Service Commission, the Federal Power Commission, a nd the Federal Reserve. In 1975, Senator John Tunney (D)CA) made the accusa tion that Mount Weather had records on more than 100,000 Americans, and a compu ter system that gave them access to detailed information on virtually every A merican. He said they were “out of control.” In 1975, Maj. General Leslie Bray, director of the Federal Preparedness Agency (which became FEMA as a result of Executive Order 1 2148 on July 20, 1979, who also took over the duties and responsibilities of the De fense Civil Preparedness Agency and Federal Disaster Assistance Administration), told t he Senate that Mount Weather has"},{"pageNumber":643,"pageContent":"extensive files on “military installations, governm ent facilities, communications, transportation, energy and power, agriculture, manu facturing, wholesale and retail services, manpower, financial, medical and educatio nal institutions, sanitary facilities, population, housing shelter, and stockpiles.” Bray also told the Senate that the list of those chosen to go there in the event of an emergen cy had 6,500 names on it. All those on the list have a photo I.D. card with the followi ng inscription: “The person described on this card has essential emergency duties with th e Federal Government. Request full assistance and unrestricted movement be afforded th e person to whom this card is issued.” Leslie W. Bray, Jr. In 1961 (Cuban Missile Crisis), 1963 (JFK assassina tion), and 2001 (September 11th terrorist attacks), the facility was activated to assume governmental responsibilities. Raven Rock At Raven Rock Mountain, at the 4,667 acre Raven Roc k State Park in Franklin County (near Fountain Dale), on Blue Ridge Summit, is an Alternate Joint Communications Center (AJCC) simply known as ‘Site R’ (for Raven Rock) or ‘The Rock,’ which is just over the state line near Wayne sboro, PA. It is about 6 miles north of the Presidential retreat of Camp David in Catoctin Mountains near Thurmont (MD), and it is believed by some to be connected with it via a tunnel. In 1950, President Truman approved the 716 acres as part of Camp Albert C. Ri tchie in Maryland. Construction began in 1950, and it became operational in 1953. I t came under the auspices of Fort Detrick (MD) when Fort Ritchie closed in September, 1998, as part of the 1995 Base Realignment and Closure Act. Because of its ‘back)u p’ status, it is known as the ‘underground Pentagon.’ It is actually a duplicate of the Pentagon’s Command and Control Center, and was used by Deputy Defense Secr etary Paul Wolfowitz during the September 11th terrorist attacks.

On Sunday, May 31, 1992, an article by Ted Gup, a Washington correspon dent for Time magazine, appeared in the Washington Post (pg. W)11), which revealed that this secret 112,00 0 square foot facility was located under and beside t he Greenbrier Resort Hotel, which is located on 6,500 acres in the Allegheny Mountains i n White Sulpher Springs in West Virginia. About 250 miles from Washington D.C., it is an hour away by plane. The luxury hotel actually looks like the White Hous e. In the winter of 1941)42, it served as an internment area for Japanese, Italian, and German diplomats. In 1949, Secretary of Defense Louis Johnson held a meeting t here with the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Secretaries of the Army, Air Force and Navy for a “top)secret discussion of postwar military strategy.” In 1956, Eisenhower had an international meeting there with the leaders of Canada and Mexico.

Warrenton Training Center The Warrenton Training Center (WTC) was initially e stablished in June, 1951, and is believed to contain an underground relocation cente r for an unknown Federal Agency. According to a report on the Environmental Protecti on Agency website, the WTC is identified as a “closed and classified communicatio ns training and support facility of the National Communications System.” The NCS was establ ished in 1963 by President Kennedy to coordinate intra)government communicatio ns between 23 Federal Agencies (including U.S. Information Agency and Postal Servi ce), as well as the State Department and CIA. In June, 1973 it was transferred to the Department of the Army, and redesignated as the U.S. Army Training Group and U.S. Army Security Agency. In September, 1982, it was placed under the auspices of the Defense Depart ment. The WTC encompasses four sites all secured by a cha in link fence. There are 2 underground facilities (Site A and B), on Vinetree Mountain, which some say are connected by a tunnel, because they are only a coup le of miles apart.

It als o has a lot of antennas, though fewer of them are high frequency. There is more activity here, and the buildings are larger. Some Other Underground Facilities in the Federal Ar c The Office of Emergency Preparedness (OEP, now know n as FEMA) built a ‘hardened’ (protected against nuclear attack) under ground facility in 1971 at 5231 Riggs Road (Gaithersburg), near junction of Routes 97 and 108, beneath a cow pasture, in Montgomery County, MD, between Olney and Laytonsvil le. It is entered by a staircase from a small surface building, although there is a horizontal entrance that is used to unload freight. The Federal Regional Center at the Olney Special Facility had served as the Alternate National Warning Center (contained a National Civil Defense Computer system) and was one of two centers (the other being at the North American Aerospace Defense Command or NORAD in Cheyenne Mountain) that would issue a warning in case of a nuclear attack on the United States. It w as believed by some to be at least 10 levels deep, however the report of 2 levels seems t o be more realistic. It takes up an area of 65,000 square feet. With the Warning Center supposedly transferred to Thomasville, Georgia, it now serves as a Satellite Teleregistration Facility, along with other Regional Centers. There was a bunker located under the north lawn of the National Park Service’s Stephen P. Mather Training Center (formerly Storer College) off Fillmore Street in Harper’s Ferry, Virginia. It was to be the emergenc y relocation center (ERC) for the Department of Interior. Containing only pedestrian access, the door is set into a retaining wall adjacent to the driveway.

Other Underground FEMA Facilities During the 1950’s, it was reported that there was a large underground facility underneath the AT&T building in downtown Santa Rose , California, which was believed to have tunnels extending a couple miles away to a nearby military base. In 1992, about 15 miles southeast of Santa Rosa, in the mountains near the Napa and Sonoma County line, another underground facility was built.

A 40 acre antenna field contains 10 above)ground, and 2 buried antenna (whi ch can be raised to the surface in the event the others are damaged). Because these installations were constructed during the Cold War, when there was a constant threat of nuclear attack, their location s were kept a highly)guarded secret. The information I outlined on the FEMA installation s within the Federal Arc is all that is known about the facilities near the seat of power i n Washington– which means there are many others. In addition, because officials from Wa shington could be anywhere in the country on a given day, it is necessary to have und erground facilities around the country. For instance, when the terrorist attacks o ccurred on September 11th President Bush was at an elementary school in Sarasota, Flori da. With the skies being a very dangerous place, his plane redirected to Offutt Air Force Base, outside Omaha, Nebraska, where he was taken to a blast)proof bunke r beneath a tiny brick building. So, basically there are probably a lot of underground f acilities around the country. Besides serving as Emergency Relocation Centers, there are also regional installations for FEMA operations, as well as bunkers that are used f or military purposes. Although it is not known how many are still operati onal, most likely a lot of them are. Again, just like the detention centers, there is a list available on the internet of underground installations throughout the country. T hough I would love to reproduce the list here, I struggled with the fact that, for the most part, these lists are not totally accurate. It is admitted that most of these underground facil ities would not be able withstand the direct hit of a nuclear blast, which is why the secrecy of their locations was so important. However, were their primary purpose to r eally be functional bomb shelters? It’s safe to say that billions of dollars were spen t to build these installations within a twenty)year period. It’s almost as if government of ficials were expecting our country to be totally decimated. I believe there was a seconda ry reason for their construction. In a time of martial law, they will be able to protect G overnment officials from any sort of paramilitary attack from the citizenry. No matter w hat is happening on the surface, they will be able to run the country and direct events f rom below.

The report further stated that “ As of mid)August 1995, the Department of Labor had certified 38,148 workers as having los t their jobs to NAFTA.” Months later, the Clinton Administration reported that 127,000 jo bs were created by NAFTA (as of 2001, according to Raul Hinojosa)Ojeda, research di rector of the North American Integration & Development Center at University of C alifornia at Los Angeles, only about 100,000 new jobs have been added), but what they di dn’t reveal, was that a report by the Joint Economic Committee of Congress indicated that the nation had lost 137,000 jobs (this total had risen to 316,000 by 2001). During the first nine months of 1994, our trade sur plus with Mexico shrunk by 27 percent. This report further said that this was “on ly the tip of the job displacement iceberg.” According to Rep.

It was an instrument of the United Nations. On January 1, 1995 the World Trade Organiz ation (WTO), the descendant of the proposed International Trade Organization (1948 ) and Organization for Trade Cooperation (1954), replaced GATT, presenting a new agreement which included “GATT 1994.” During the 1940’s and 1950’s the Congr ess and the country was not ready to have their economic authority transferred to international control. In 1958, Sen. George Malone of Nevada said: “The global theory of free trade is siphoning off America’s wealth and bringing her economy to the le vel of others. The theory is displacing American workers who otherwise would be employed.” “GATT 1994” was a document consisting of 22,000 pag es of information, tariff schedules, rules and regulations; and 650 pages of enabling legislation. Based on its size, how many of our legislators do you think read every word of this trade agreement; and based on its complexity, if it was read– was it understood? It is the only international agreement which sets t he global rules for world trade, and provides for the mediation of disputes, which is ar gued by many to be the best way to open up foreign markets to U.S. exports, because pr otectionist countries, as well as the U.S. would have to lower their tariffs (producing a loss in revenue), to create an even playing field.

Financier, Sir James Goldsmith, a member of the Eur opean Parliament, said in his testimony before Congress, that GATT would “cause a global social upheaval the likes of which Karl Marx never envisioned.” The October 2 4, 1994 issue of Barron’s , indicated that the WTO is a de facto world government.

In 1999, Warner Brothers released a little movie ca lled The Matrix . Not considered a major project, it was shot in Australia to save mon ey. Expectations were not high for this edgy sci)fi action film, however, after its opening , it was quite clear that its writers, the Wachowski Brothers had struck gold by tapping into the collective intellectual consciousness of a nation that was preparing to ent er a new millennium. Most movies are made to entertain, and are fairly straight forw ard in their approach, but The Matrix challenged its viewers. Incredibly unique was the f act that different people, who saw it, had different interpretations of its meaning. The plot revolves around Neo, a computer hacker (pl ayed by Keanu Reaves) who discovers that the world he lives in is nothing mor e than a computer simulation that is being fed into his brain as his body rests in a pod , in the real world, along with endless numbers of others, providing the energy that sustai ns the machines that run the world. Although Neo believes himself to be existing in the real world, his physical body is actually lying comatose in a pod, while images a re being sent to his brain When I read the original script, there were lines i n there that did not appear in the movie. For instance, “Anthony” (whose name was chan ged to Choi in the movie) says to DuJour about Neo: “I told you, honey, he may look l ike just another geek but this here is all we got left standing between Big Brother (a ter m from George Orwell’s book 1984 ) and the New World Order.” Also, in a chatroom calle d “The Matrix,” we find the following comments: Quark: “The Matrix is a euphemism for the governmen t.” Superastic: “No, the Matrix is the system controlli ng our lives.” It’s not hard to see that these lines were removed, so the movie wouldn’t come across as being a political commentary that was int ended to convey their contention that we are living in the “Matrix,” which is being contr olled in the real world by the boys in the"},{"pageNumber":664,"pageContent":"New World Order. Especially revealing is the scene in the movie when Neo meets Morpheus (Lawrence Fishburne), the leader of the resistance, at the Lafayette Hotel, and tells him what the Matrix is: “The Matrix is everywhere. It is all around us. Eve n now, in this very room. You can see it when you look out your window, or when y ou turn on your television. You can feel it when you go to work, when you go to church, when you pay your taxes. It is the world that has been pulled over yo ur eyes, to blind you from the truth.” Morpheus Applying the Wachowski’s innuendo to our current si tuation, we find that they have described a system of ‘Command and Control’ that ha s been able to so dominate and overwhelm that we have been completely deceived int o believing a lie. In the movie, Neo is unplugged from the Matrix, ena bling him to see the real world. It is my hope, that with the knowledge you gain from r eading this book, you will be ‘unplugged’ from the Matrix, and begin to see for y ourself that things aren’t what they seem.

Even though we have gone back to look at the roots, and evolution of this mo vement, the actual motive goes back much farther than that. Just think, what motivation could there be to fuel that kind of desire. The answer is that you have to look at thin gs with a spiritual eye, in order to comprehend the complexities that the New World Orde r actually represents. And when you do that, then you can understand how it has bee n able to progress through all these years, and why it will continue. This Part will deal with the application of the Fir st Part to Biblical research and end) time prophecy. Although space constraints will only allow a general treatise of the major elements, I will be dealing with these matters in a much more detailed fashion on my website (www.viewfromthewall.com) in the near futur e. When you read Genesis 1:1)2, it says: “In the begin ning God created the heaven and the earth. And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.” The Rotherham translation of the Bible, which was taken from the original Hebrew, says: “Now the earth had become waste and empty.” You hav e to understand that there was an undetermined amount of time which passed between these two verses. However, we do have some clues about certain events which occur red before Adam, and the refurbishing of this world for his habitation. Lucifer Just as God told Noah and his sons in Genesis 9:1 t o “replenish” the earth after the flood, God had told Adam and Eve the same thing in Genesis 1:28. This seems to indicate that there were men on the earth before Ad am. Proof of this can be found in Jeremiah 4:23)26. Now you can understand the time f rame, and the circumstances"},{"pageNumber":667,"pageContent":"regarding Lucifer (the ‘lightbringer’). He was a “c herub” (the highest classification of angels), and is described in the Bible as being wis e and perfect. It was his job to bring light. Eventually he became proud of himself, and s ought to take the place of God (Isaiah 14:12)17, Ezekiel 28:2, I Timothy 3:6). He led a third of the angels (Revelation 12:4) in a revolt against Michael, the archangel, a nd the remaining angels (Jude 1:6, II Peter 2:4)5) for the control of Heaven. This battle for the control of Heaven nearly destroyed the earth. After his defeat, Lucifer was cast down to earth, where he became known as “Satan” (which means ‘adversary’), the lea der of the fallen angels (or demons), and the “god of this world.” (2 Corinthian s 4:4) The fall of Lucifer When God renewed the earth, and created man in His image, He gave Adam dominion over the earth, which infuriated Satan, wh o had the impression that he was to rule over the earth. Again, Satan plotted against G od, and caused Adam and Eve to sin by eating the fruit of the tree which was forbidden by God. For their sin, they were banished from the Garden of Eden. Ever since then, Satan has been carrying out his plan to corrupt and control the earth. For six thou sand years, a small group of satanically empowered men have been feverishly work ing to eliminate God and to enslave mankind. The New World Order is nothing mor e than the culmination of these efforts; the final step of a plan that will enable Satan to again challenge God, and the angelic forces of Heaven. Helping Things Along In the story about Cain and Abel, when Cain killed his brother, he was cursed by God (Gen. 4:11) and exiled. Genesis 4:12 says: “Whe n thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength...” Yet , we find that Cain established the city of Enoch; and his descendants Jubal, was the father of those who became proficient in the harp and organ, and Tubalcain, was a teacher of brass and iron works. We also find, that it wasn’t until Enos, the son of Seth, t hat men began “to call upon the name of"},{"pageNumber":668,"pageContent":"the Lord.” (Gen. 4:26) Though it doesn’t say, the i mplication is that the line of Cain was ungodly. The apocryphal Second Book of Adam and Eve, bluntly gives details about this. In chapter 20:2)4, it says: “But as to this Genun (a s on of Lamech), Satan came into him in his childhood; and he made sundry trumpets and horn s, and string instruments, cymbals and psalteries, and lyres and harps, and fl utes; and he played on them at all times and at every hour. And when he played on them , Satan came into them, so that from among them were heard beautiful and sweet soun ds, that ravished the heart. Then he gathered companies upon companies to play on the m; and when they played, it pleased well the children of Cain, who inflamed the mselves with sin among themselves, and burnt as with fire; while Satan inflamed their hearts, one with another, and increased lust among them.” Although the origin and truth of this apocryphal bo ok can never be ascertained, and it never became part of the holy canon, it is belie ved that the writings were part of an older, more ancient document that accurately reflec ted upon the events of this historical period. For a family line that has been perceived a s being ungodly, they developed musical instruments, and the expertise and ability of producing weapons of war from metal mined out of the earth. Was the knowledge of these things God)given? I have concluded that they were not, and even though the e vidence is circumstantial, I believe that Satan, through demons, divulged this informati on. Ezekiel 28:13 relates that there were musical instr uments created within the body of Lucifer, and it has been said that every time he mo ved, he played music. He led the angelic praise and worship of God. So when he fell, he knew the importance of music, and how to use it to his advantage. It seems likely that he would have bestowed the knowledge of music. Primitive cultures, American In dian ceremonies, and occult rituals are well known to have used the hypnotic and influe ntial properties of music to enhance their activities. And through weapons, and the means to wage war, peo ple are controlled. So, yes, I believe that there was some Satanic infl uence on the technology of the people at the time, because he was laying the groun dwork for his plans to regain control of the world that he once ruled. According to Tom Van Asperen there is a language of Twice Speak in the Bible, which is a separate code language, much like Equidi stant Letter Sequencing, and Mathematical Signature. Basically, it is a revealin g of the “secret” talked about in Amos 3:7 that has unlocked the typical and anti)typical method of recording Biblical history, and at the same time, end)time prophetic events. As peren believes there is so much of this type of prophecy in the Old Testament, that, i n a sense, it becomes another New Testament. I have found some of the Twice Speak revelations to be fascinating in as far as it acts as an underlying witness to the Scriptures. Ho wever, when the interpretations provide new information that can not be found in th e Biblical text then I have to question it. But, although this concept may be new to you, a nd may seem kind of off the wall, let’s just assume for argument’s sake that it is a divine Biblical code that proves the word of God, gives us a better understanding of it, and fur ther reveals end)time prophetic events; and let’s assume that the events concerning the line of Cain is also a prophecy concerning the last days."},{"pageNumber":669,"pageContent":"In 1997, Simon and Schuster published a book called The Day After Roswell , by Col. Philip J. Corso (Ret.). The cover proclaimed: “The truth exposed after fifty years) A former Pentagon official reveals the U.S. Governmen t’s shocking UFO cover)up.” The subject of the book was the alleged crash of a flyi ng saucer in Roswell, New Mexico, where alien bodies and pieces of the aircraft were recovered back in 1947. The government has long denied this happened, and indee d continues to deny the existence of flying saucers and extraterrestrial life. You mi ght not believe in flying saucers. But bear with me, I don’t want you to question my credi bility now. Corso’s expose’ about Roswell Let’s look at the time period this occurred. It was 1947, which was around the time that flying saucers were first sighted. Now what el se happened about that time? The United Nations was established in 1945, and Israel became an independent nation in 1948. These two events occurring around the same ti me was not a coincidence, because it set the stage for Armageddon, and the fu lfillment of all things. The United Nations, or the foundation for a world government, was the prophetic trigger, and with the time)sensitive prophecies contained in the Bibl e, Satan knew that he was running out of time. It was initially reported that a flying saucer cras hed at Roswell, and also at that time, there were enough sightings and pictures in other p arts of the country to give the report credibility. Since then, there has been so much evi dence for the existence of flying"},{"pageNumber":670,"pageContent":"saucers and aliens, that it’s become pretty much an accepted fact, even though the government continues to deny their existence. In fa ct, there is so much information and evidence, that now, the Christian church has said t hat, yes, there is something to it all.. The Christian perspective, and growing consensus, i s that aliens are actually demonic manifestations. There have been four or five Christ ian books on the subject. So, again, let’s assume that there was a flying saucer that cr ashed at Roswell. Philip Corso, is his book The Day After Roswell , relates, that as a member of President Eisenhower’s National Security Council, h is Research and Development team at the Pentagon analyzed and integrated the alien a rtifacts found at Roswell into the private business sector. According to him, major co mpanies such as IBM, Hughes Aircraft, Bell Labs, and Dow Corning, were unknowin gly given the alien technology, which became the integrated circuit chips, fiber op tics, lasers, and the super)tenacity fibers of today. What I want to hone in on, is the information in Ch apter 12, which discusses the “Integrated Circuit Chip: From the Roswell Crash Si te to Silicon Valley.” Among the wreckage, Corso said that charred quarter)size, cra cker)shaped, silicon wafers were found, which had grid lines etched on them, which w as actually microscopic circuitry. An analysis of the craft’s remains failed to turn up a ny wiring, so it was determined that these chips actually represented the nerve center o f the vehicle, carrying signals through the ship, just like impulses are carried th roughout the nervous system of our body. Corso wrote (page 167): “Although IBM and Bel l Labs were investing huge sums of development money into designing a computer that had a lower operational and maintenance overhead, it seemed, given the technolo gy of the digital computer circa 1947, that there was no place it could go. It was s imply an expensive)to)build, expensive)to)run, lumbering elephant at the end of the line. And then an alien spacecraft fell out of the skies over Roswell, scat tered across the desert floor, and in one evening everything changed.” In 1948, it was revealed that the first junction si licon transistor had been developed by Bell Telephone Laboratories, and the technologic al capabilities of the computer industry took a huge leap in a short period of time . Even Corso wondered about where it would all lead (page 172): “..what if an enemy want ed to implant the perfect spying or sabotage mechanism into a culture? Then the implant ation of the microchip)based circuit into our technology by the EBEs (aliens) wo uld be the perfect method. Was it planted as sabotage or as something akin to the gif t of fire? Maybe the Roswell crash in 1947 was an event waiting to happen, like poisoned fruit dropping from the tree into a playground.” Now, instead of aliens, think demons, and I believe we have an anti)typical fulfillment of the prophetic event that took place when the lin e of Cain was given hidden knowledge. I believe that our computer technology, which developed into the Internet, is part of Satan’s plan for the last days, and will be used to carry out his devious end)time plot. Only God is omnipotent and omnipresent, howev er, through a world)wide computer network, Satan will be able to falsely misrepresent his power. For years, it was believed that the huge computer in Brussels, Belgium would b e the one that would be used to record the files of everyone on Earth. Now it has c ome to light that our National Security Agency has a huge classified underground database a t Fort Meade, Maryland, that covers an area of ten acres."},{"pageNumber":671,"pageContent":"THE BEGINNING OF THE END: The Prophetic Trigger of God’s Timeline For hundreds of years, it has been common knowledge within the Church, that mankind’s life span upon this earth would be 6,000 years. This was gleaned from Exodus 20:9)10, which says: “Six days shalt thou la bor ... But the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God.” Like many things in t he Scriptures, it had a deeper meaning beyond what was being conveyed about their calendar, which was later revealed in 2 Peter 3:8 – “But, beloved, be not ign orant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand y ears as one day.” In 1650, using these Scriptures, Archbishop Jacob U ssher of Armagh in Ireland, attempted to calculate when the Creation took place by using chronological information from the Bible and counting backward from the date of the birth of Christ. At that time, it was believed that Christ was born in 4 BC (some cal culations had indicated that it may have been as late as 1 BC or as early as 6 BC; howe ver, recent evidence have determined it to be 3 BC), so Ussher theorized that the Creation took place in 4004 BC, and the passing of four “days” (two thousand years before the law, and two thousand years after the law) took us to Christ’s birth in 4 BC, so two more ‘days’ would end the six ‘days’ at 1996. The Sabbath, or the seventh ‘da y,’ is the Millennium, or the thousand)year reign of Jesus Christ upon the Earth, which is referred to in the 20th chapter of Revelation. An apocryphal book known as the Epistle of Barnabas , which early church leaders such as Origen and Jerome believed had been written by the first recruit of the Apostle Paul, Barnabas, said: “And God made in six days the works of His hands; a nd He finished them on the seventh day, and rested on the seventh day and sanc tified it. Consider, my children, what that signifies, He finished them in six days. The meaning of it is this: that in six thousand years the Lord God will bring all things to an end. For with him, one day is a thousand years; as Himself t estifieth, saying, behold this day shall be as a thousand years. Therefore childre n, in six days, that is, in six thousand years, shall all things be accomplished. A nd what is it that He saith, and He rested the seventh day; He meaneth this; tha t when his Son shall come, and abolish the season of the wicked one, and judge the ungodly; and shall change the sun and the moon, and the stars, then He shall gloriously rest in that seventh day.” Irenaeus, an early church leader, while writing in 150 AD about the book of Genesis in his book Against Heresies said: “This is an account of the things formerly c reated, as also it is a prophecy of what is to come. For the d ay of the Lord is as a thousand years; and in six days created things were completed; it i s evident, therefore, that they will come to an end at the sixth thousand years.” Around 300 AD, in the writings of Christian scholar Lactantius, he said: “Because all the works of God were finished in six days, it is necessary that the world should remain in this stat e six ages, that is six thousand years. Because having finished the works He rested on the seventh day and blessed it; it is necessary that at the end of the sixth thousandth y ear all the wickedness should be"},{"pageNumber":672,"pageContent":"abolished out of the earth and justice should reign a thousand years.” Other writers during the early Christian era also reflected this premise. Some researchers have sought to adjust the calculat ions of this theory. The Jewish calendar conformed to the solar year, which contain ed 360 days, or 12 months of 30 days. In 1583, the Gregorian calendar was adopted, which added an extra 5.25 days to that year. If you add 2,160,000 days (6,000 years X 360 days) to 2,173.50 days (414 years of 5.25 days), you get 2,162,173.50 days, whi ch divided by the Jewish year of 360 days, would make the end of the sixth day, the year 2002. When you deduct from that figure, the seven year period which is commonl y referred to as the Tribulation period, that leaves us with the year of 1995 as the culmination of the efforts to establish a New World Order. There is another theory, which has to do with the a mount of time that the Jewish race would be dispersed across the Earth. The Jews were in bondage in Egypt for 430 years and later for 70 years in Babylon. These date s were foretold. The purpose of the prophecy which is given in Ezekiel 4:1)8 was to sho w how long the Jews would be scattered as a people. Other Scriptures deal with t he extent of the dispersal: Deut. 28:25, Deut. 28:64, Jer. 24:9, and Amos 9:9. Adding the 390 and 40 years, gives you 430 years. Leviticus 26:18 says: “And if ye will no t yet for all this hearken unto me, then I will punish you seven times more for your sins.” From 430, subtract the 70 years they were punished in Babylon, and what God was telling Moses, was that the Jewish people would be dispersed for 2,520 years (360 years X 7). Now here is where it gets a little tricky. Nebuchad nezaar’s first return of his Jewish captives was in 536 BC, and the final return was in 516 BC. Again, using the adjustment for the two calendars, and using the earliest date of 536 BC, we get these calculations: 907,200 days (2520 years X 360 days) plus 2,110.50 days (402 years X 5.25 days) is 909,310.50 days divided by 360 days of the Jewish c alendar is 2525.86 years, or the year 1990. But then, the latter date of 516 BC, wou ld give us the year 2010. The Bible also says that the events of the end time s would not take place until all of the Jews returned to their homeland, and this retur n is referred to in: Isa. 5:26, Isa. 11:11)12, Isa. 43:5)6, Jer. 16:15, Jer. 30:3, Eze. 34:11)13, Eze. 36:24, and Zech. 10:8. This return of God’s chosen people, only refers to pure, full)blooded Jews (Gen. 6:1)4, Ezra 10:2)18, Neh. 13:27, Jude 1:7). In 1800, Pales tine had a population of 150 Jews; 1827) 1,500 Jews; 1850) 8,000; 1910) 41,000; 1914) 100,000; 1930) 170,000; 1935) 300,000; 1939) 450,000; 1948) 650,000; 1953) 1,300, 000; 1962) 2,000,000; and 1970) 2,500,000. Now there are nearly five million Jews in Israel which have been gathered up from over 102 different nations. A gentleman by the name of Joe Marler had proposed a theory based on Daniel 9:25)26 which says: “Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks, and three score and two weeks: the str eet shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times. And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off...” The Hebrew word for “week” is ‘shabula’ whi ch means ‘seven,’ indicating that a ‘week’ is actually 7 ‘weeks’ of years, or 49 years, which is known as the Jubilee cycle (Lev. 25:8). The 62 weeks began when the city of Jerusalem, and its Temple, which was destroyed in 586 BC, was rebuilt. Three such decree s were given. The first came during"},{"pageNumber":673,"pageContent":"the first year of the reign of Cyrus (King of Persi a, 536)527 BC), who ruled for nine years; after which his son Cambyses (527)520 BC) to ok over, and all the work on the Temple was stopped for seven years. The second decr ee was made by Darius I, in the second year of his 35)year reign (520)485 BC). Cons truction resumed on the Temple in 520 under Zerubbabel, the Persian governor, and was completed between 516)514 BC. Then Xerxes reigned 21 years (485)464 BC). Artaxerx es ruled 40 years (464)424 BC), and during his seventh year, in 457 BC, he decreed that Jerusalem be restored. Nehemiah, the cupbearer to Artaxerxes, was sent to Jerusalem in 444 BC to complete the work on the walls of the city to fortify it. Th us the period of 62 weeks represents 434 years, which added to 444 BC, indicates the date of 10 BC, which is close to the time of the birth of Christ. Marler’s research somehow led him to the period of 440)438 BC, and adding 434 years to 438 BC led to 4 BC, which is closer to the actual date of the birth of Jesus. Marler believes that the other seven ‘weeks’ or 49 years apply to the second coming of Jesus. Rather than using the date of May 14, 1948, when Israel officially became an independent country, he used the date of November 2 9, 1947, when the United Nations voted 33)13 to approve a Jewish homeland. Adding 49 years indicated a date of November 29, 1996, as the end of man’s rule on this Earth. By counting back 3)1/2 years, he theorized that the period known as the Tr ibulation would begin May 29, 1993. The irony here is a story that was reported on the news on May 19, 1993. Big Ben, the renowned tower clock famous for its accuracy, which was installed in 1859 at the eastern end of the Houses of Parliament in London, had mysteriously stopped running. Was the most recognized time piece in the world sto pped through divine means to signal the beginning of the end? No. And another ‘d ate’ has come and gone. There are also those researchers who have chosen to totally base all of their calculations on the premise of 360 days indicating a Biblical year. For instance, in Hosea 6:1)2 it says: “Come, and let us return unto the Lord: for he hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up. A fter two days will he revive us: in the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live in his sight.” From the initiation of Christ’s ministry, in the fall of 28 AD, and adding two “day s” (2 years X 360 days) would give us 720,000 days, which adjusted to our calendar by div iding into that 365.25 results in 1971.25 years, which added to 28.75, takes us to th e year 2000. Another one has to do with the cleansing of the Tem ple. In 168 BC, the Syrian King Antiochus IV Epiphanes attacked Israel, and sacrifi ced a pig to Zeus on the Temple altar, an event that is referred to as the Abominat ion of Desolation. The period till cleansing, according to Daniel 8:14, was 2,300 days , which some scholars feel refers to 2,300 morning and evening rituals, or 1,150 days (3 years, 2 months and 10 days), which seemingly points to the ritual cleansing perf ormed by Judas Maccabaeus three years later, after the success of the Hasmonean rev olt. However, according to the apocryphal book of the Maccabees, the Temple was cl eansed in 1,080 days. To make matters worse, while the King James version states 2,300 days for this period, the Greek Septuagint, which was used during the time of Christ, says 2,400 days. In his 1754 book Dissertations on the Prophecies , Bishop Thomas Newton wrote about the existence of a third manuscript of the bo ok of Daniel, which was mentioned in a Commentary of Jerome, the early church leader. Th is manuscript gives the figure of 2,200 days. Since this figure can not be applied li terally to the events of that time, it is"},{"pageNumber":674,"pageContent":"believed that the figure should be considered as ye ars. This assumption is based upon Ezekiel 4:6, which says: “I have appointed thee eac h day for a year”; and Numbers 14:31, which talks of “each day for a year.” If the figure of 2,200 ‘days’ is used, the following calculation is then applied: 2,200 years X 360 days = 792,000 days, which adjusted for our calendar year of 365.25, results i n 2,168 years. When this figure is added to 168 BC, it leads us to the year 2000. Another theory deals with the Times of the Gentiles . This phrase stems from a statement by Jesus in Luke 21:24: “...and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfil led.” This refers to a period which began in 606 BC when the Babylonians conquered Jerusalem. In Daniel 4:23, according to Nebuchadnezzar’s vision (who is represented by a tr ee, as men sometimes were: Psalms 1:3, Psalms 37:35, Ez. 31:3), “seven times” were to pass over him. Revelation 11:2)3 (“42 months” X 30= 1,260 days), Rev. 12:6 (“ a thousand two hundred and threescore days” or 1,260 days), Rev. 12:14 (“a tim e, and times, and half a time” or 360 + 720 + 180= 1,260 days) indicates that a “time” is 360 days, which means that seven “times” would be 2,520 ‘days’ or years (on top of r eferring to the seven years God struck him down with a period of insanity to show his powe r). The calculation would go like this: 2,520 years X 3 60 days = 907,200 days, which adjusted to our calendar year of 365.25 days, resul ts in 2,483.78 years. When this figure is added to 606 BC, it leads us to the year 1878, which is believed to be the end of “the times of the Gentiles.” Now comes an intere sting proposal. When Jesus spoke of the way things were in the “days of Noah,” when God gave mankind an additional 120 years (Gen. 6:3) to repent, before he sent the floo d; this period has been added to the year 1878 (of course in the adjusted form of 118.28 of our calendar years), which indicates the year of 1997 as the end of “the times of the Gentiles” and the beginning of the judgment period known as the Tribulation, which when you add this 3)1/2 years, and leads us to the year 2000. Let me throw one more at you, which came to me from an e)mail, and the website of Torstein Langesaeter from Norway, who made a very d etailed mathematical calculation to determine the number of years between Adam, and Jesus; and believes that the period of 6,000 years will conclude in 2028. All of these calculations can be somewhat correlate d to the six ‘day’ theory, in that it indicates a time frame for events within this 6,000 year period. Jesus was very specific when He spoke about the signs of His return, and He exhorted His disciples to watch, and pray. Because of the symbolism, type and anti)t ypes, and dual prophecies used in the Bible, was there something that would signal th e end of time as we got closer to the end of the six ‘days’ or 6,000 years? In Luke 21:25 , Jesus talked about the “signs ... upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity ...” There was a period in our history when a sequence o f events occurred which seemed to set the stage for the fulfillment of Bibl e prophecy. Let’s look at the events which happened during the three year period of 1945 – 1948: 1) On June 26, 1945, at a San Francisco conference, 50 nations met to adopt the United Nations charter. The UN General Assembly hel d their first meeting in London on January 10, 1946. "},{"pageNumber":675,"pageContent":"2) A UFO was reported to have crashed in Roswell, N ew Mexico on July 4, 1947. 3) On November 29, 1947, the UN voted to approve a Jewish homeland, and on May 14, 1948, Israel became a nation. 4) It has been long accepted that the Dead Sea Scro lls were discovered in 1947, but according to Randall Price in his book Secrets of the Dead Sea Scrolls he found out that they may have actually been discover ed as early as 1936. However, 1947 was time when their existence was rev ealed. 5) The World Council of Churches was established on August 23, 1948. Just as we are able to interpret prophecy, and dete rmine the signs of the times– so has Satan. He knew the time that Israel would proph etically be resurrected as a nation, and he had to make sure his plans would be in place , so, when the time came, he would be able to deceive the world into accepting the Ant ichrist as the messiah. Let’s look at the events surrounding Israel becomin g a nation. The establishment of the United Nations would herald the move toward one )world government. As discussed earlier, recent exposé has shown that there was a U FO crash at Roswell, and among the technology gleaned from it was integrated circu it chips, fiber optics, and lasers. The treasure of ancient documents found at Qumran has y ielded copies of nearly every Old Testament book, however, it has also turned up docu ments from a Jewish sect known as the Essenes. As these Dead Sea Scrolls were tran slated in secret, the scholars behind them began to use them to undermine the divi nity Jesus, by saying that the Essenes were the true originators of what became kn own as Christianity. And the World Council of Churches would begin the move toward ecu menicalism that is seeking to bring all the world’s religions together into one u nified body. Now let’s put these events in perspective with Bibl e prophecy. Jesus said in Matthew 24:34 – “Verily I say unto yo u, This generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled.” Jesus was spea king to his disciples concerning the last days, and had just told them about the parable of t he fig tree. Some Bible scholars have interpreted Ezekiel 36:8 to mean that the fig tree represented the nation of Israel. So it is believed that Jesus was referring to the generat ion that would be alive when Israel became a nation on May 14, 1948. Job 42:16 refers t o a generation as being 35 years, while Webster’s Dictionary indicates that it is for ty years. The figure of 40 years is echoed in Hebrews 3:9)10 which says: “When your fat hers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty years. Wherefore I was grieved w ith that generation...” Adding 40 years to 1948 would give us the year 1988. But let me add another wrinkle to this theory. It i s no secret that Bible prophecy, and the understanding of it, revolves around Israel. Is rael is the only nation that is referred to in the masculine gender. According to Jewish custom , a male is labeled under the following age categories: child (1)12), young man ( 13)19), warrior (20)29), and mature man (30)50, who is able to officiate in the Temple) . The age of 50 is the age of retirement (and Jubilee). So if you interpret this as being symbolic and add 50 years to 1948, you get the year 1998, which is more closely aligned with the other calculations. I think you’ll agree that this sequence of events w as unprecedented, and that it was"},{"pageNumber":676,"pageContent":"no coincidence that these major events happened in such a short period of time. This is why I believe, that collectively, they represent th e prophetic trigger that has set into motion the time which has come to be known as the “ last days.” These events began the toppling of the prophetic dominoes that will ev entually lead to the fulfillment of all things, and the culmination of the events foretold in the books of Daniel, Ezekiel, and Revelation. Though Jesus said in Matthew 24:36 “... of that day and hour knoweth no man,” the prophetic outline He gave indicated the warning sig ns we are to look for. When it is cloudy, it is a sign that it is going to rain. Much the same, Jesus told his disciples what to look for, and in Matt. 24:33 explained that “whe n ye shall see all these things, know that it is near...” I for one will not try to calcu late a date. I believe that it’s okay to come up with a time frame, but in the context that we al so consider the signs that Jesus told us to look for. We have been seeing the signs. With out a doubt the end is near. Make sure that your heart is right with God. Watch, and pray. THE RAPTURE When this manuscript was initially printed in 1984, I had included a brief section on the Rapture, just to basically cover all the differ ent Rapture theories. Since I grew up being taught in church that there was going to be a Pre)Tribulation Rapture, I sort of leaned that way. But because of all my research, an d actually getting into the Scriptures myself, I began to rethink Pre)Trib. When the book was published in 1994, I did not include anything about the Rapture, either way, for fear that it would alienate people and detract from the message I was presenting. However, things are quite different now. With the j uggernaut of the “Left Behind” series consuming this country with best)selling boo ks, audio books, movies, videos and DVD’s with their Pre)Tribulation Rapture theory, I felt it was necessary to weigh in with the results of my research. Believe it or not, it’s pretty straight forward, and the Scripture doesn’t require a theological scholar to interpret its meaning. The word ‘rapture’ is not in the Bible. It actually comes from the Latin word ‘rapturo,’ which means ‘to seize or be carried away in one’s s pirit,’ or the transporting from one place to another, and comes from the 1 Thessalonian s 4:17 term “caught up.” The original Greek word was ‘harpazo,’ and refers to th e same thing. The notion of the Rapture, with its Pre)Tribulation, Mid)Tribulation, Partial Tribulation, and Post) Tribulation theories have been one of the most divi sive issues in the Church, with the Pre)Trib view being the prevailing one. If this is your view, please do not be offended that I would kick this sacred cow until you have re ad the evidence. The Rapture is a supernatural event that the Church has said will occur in the end) times to remove them from this world when ‘trouble’ starts. “But there shall not an hair of your head perish.” (Luke 21:28) “Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sle ep, but we shall all be changed, In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, a t the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised i ncorruptible, and we shall be"},{"pageNumber":677,"pageContent":"changed.” (1 Corinthians 15:51)52) The following Scriptures are key– “For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven wit h a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the d ead in Christ shall rise first: Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall w e ever be with the Lord.” (1 Thessalonians 4:16)17) “So man lieth down, and riseth not: till the heaven s be no more, they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep.” (Job 14:1 2) There is no reason that we can’t take these verses literally. We can see that when Jesus returns, there will be a resurrection of the dead, and then a ‘catching away’ of the living. This will occur when the “heavens be no mor e.” In John 6:44, Jesus says: “No man can come to me, except the Father which hath se nt me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day.” If He would return before the Tribulation, that wouldn’t be the “last day.” So, when is He going to return? “And the gospel must first be published among all nations.” (Mark 13:10) “But he that shall endure unto the end, the same sh all be saved. And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world f or a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come. When ye therefore shal l see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place C For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since t he beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be C Then if any man shal l say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or there; believe it not. For there shall a rise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; i nsomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect C Where fore if they shall say unto you, Behold, he is in the desert; go not forth: beh old, he is in the secret chambers; believe it not. For as the lightning com eth out of the east, and shineth even unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be. For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be. Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not g ive her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heave ns shall be shaken: And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.” (Matthew 24:13 )30) “And they shall say to you, See here; or, see there : go not after them, nor follow them. For as the lightning, that lighteneth out o f the one part under heaven, shineth unto the other part under heaven; so shall also the Son of man be in his"},{"pageNumber":678,"pageContent":"day.” (Luke 17:23)24) “Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together unto him C Let no man deceiv e you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a fallin g away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition; Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so t hat he as God sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God C And now ye know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time.” (2 Thessalonians 2:1)6) These four Scriptures give you an absolute time fra me for the coming of Jesus. There’s only one resurrection– not two; He’s only c oming one time– not twice. There is nowhere in the Scripture that indicates the He is c oming twice. It really irritates me when I hear well)meaning ministers on the radio or telev ision who say that ‘Jesus could come back tonight– are you ready?’ No, Jesus is not comi ng back tonight! How do I know that? Because God’s Word says so. Christ will not r eturn to this earth until– The Gospel is preached and distributed to the entir e world. A “falling away” will occur. The “abomination of desolation” and the revealing o f the “man of sin” takes place. The three things that have to happen before Christ’ s return is that the Gospel has to be presented to the entire world (which quite possi bly has been fulfilled), there must be a “falling away,” (which has not occurred yet), and the “abomination of desolation,” which is when the Antichrist will reveal himself as the Messiah in the Temple. Then the Tribulation will come. “Confirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorti ng them to continue in the faith, and that we must through much tribulation enter int o the kingdom of God.” (Acts 14:22) Jesus tells his disciple that He will return “imme diately after the tribulation.” Of the period after the Tribulation, Jesus says: “Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may b e accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, an d to stand before the Son of man.” (Luke 21:36) Though Christians can’t even consider being on the earth during the Tribulation, there are examples, and Scripture to support the ca se for this. Jesus Himself (Luke 17:26)30, see also Isaiah 43:2) in His discussion a bout the end)times, used the days of Noah and Lot as examples. Noah, and his family endu red the Flood in an ark of protection. Lot and his family escaped the destruct ion of Sodom only by being obedient and turning their backs on the city. If you remembe r, Lot’s wife didn’t listen. Jesus even"},{"pageNumber":679,"pageContent":"pointed that out in Luke 17:32 when He said: “Remem ber Lot’s wife.” In addition, the Hebrews were protected from the plagues that were b rought against Pharaoh and Egypt. We can also take note of Shadrach, Meshach a nd Abednego surviving the fiery furnace, as well as Daniel going through the ordeal in the Lion’s Den. These examples also lead us into another aspect of end)time theolo gy which further explains the flow of events. It is important to delineate between the Tribulatio n period, and the time of Armageddon. The Tribulation, or the time when the A ntichrist influences the world, is man’s wrath on man. The time of the end, when Jesus returns, will be God’s wrath on man. The examples of Noah, Lot, and the Hebrews wer e examples of God’s wrath, and a separation from it. The examples of Shadrach and the boys, and Daniel, were examples of going through tribulation, man’s wrath, and being protected. And you’ll notice that these incidents are in the book of Dani el, the prophetic book that gives information about the time of the Antichrist. The time when Jesus is to return has been referred to as the ‘day of the Lord.’ So let’s look at what that is. “Behold, the day of the LORD cometh, cruel both wit h wrath and fierce anger, to lay the land desolate: and he shall destroy the sin ners thereof out of it.” (Isaiah 13:9) “For the indignation of the LORD is upon all nation s, and his fury upon all their armies: he hath utterly destroyed them, he hath del ivered them to the slaughter C For it is the day of the LORD's vengeance, and th e year of recompences for the controversy of Zion.” (Isaiah 34:2, :8) “Alas for the day! for the day of the LORD is at ha nd, and as a destruction from the Almighty shall it come.” (Joel 1:15) “Woe unto you that desire the day of the LORD! to w hat end is it for you? the day of the LORD is darkness, and not light.” (Amos 5:18 ) “The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moo n into blood, before the great and notable day of the Lord come:” (Acts 2:20) “But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in th e night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the element s shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.” (2 Peter 3:10) “And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vine of the earth, and cast it into the great winepress of the wrath of God.” (Revelation 14:9) The ‘day of the Lord’ is associated with His vengea nce and wrath, and is most detailed in the book of Revelation. This is the “la st day” that Jesus talked about. God’s wrath is not meant for His people– His Church. You can see this in 1 Thessalonians 5:9: “For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obt ain salvation by our Lord Jesus"},{"pageNumber":680,"pageContent":"Christ.” Rev. 3:10 says: “Because thou hast kept th e word of my patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth.” This is the time that J esus will return, before God’s wrath is brought upon the earth. Even though we are given the seasons in time when t he Rapture will occur, Jesus said in Matthew 24:36: “But of that day and hour k noweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only.” However, the following portions of Scripture definitively illustrates the time frame that the Rapture will t ake place, and to me, it can’t be any plainer. “And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come ou t of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the m outh of the false prophet. For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, w hich go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty. Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame. And he gathered them together into a place called in the H ebrew tongue Armageddon.” (Revelation 16:13)16) “For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night. For when they shall say, Peace and safet y; then sudden But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief. destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a wom an with child; and they shall not escape C Therefore let us not sleep, as do oth ers; but let us watch and be sober.” (1 Thessalonians 5:2)6) These passages indicate that the Antichrist and Fal se Prophet are preparing for Armageddon, which will be the “great day of God Alm ighty.” Jesus will come as a “thief,” a term used to indicate the Rapture, and t he admonition of ‘watching’ and ‘keeping your garments,’ is a warning to keep your heart right, and not be a part of the “falling away.” There has been some much)criticized research by Dav e MacPherson to indicate that the Pre)Tribulation Rapture may be a fairly recent creation. Great men of God like John Wesley, Charles Wesley, Charles Spurgeon, Matthew H enry, John Knox, John Calvin, Isaac Newton, George Whitfield, John Newton, Jonath an Edwards and John Wycliffe never talked about a Pre)Trib Rapture, because the concept literally did not exist. In 1993, after years of investigation, in a well)resea rched, well)articulated manner, MacPherson was able to put the whole story together about the actual origin of the Pre) Tribulation Rapture teaching. A gentleman by the name of John Nelson Darby (1800) 82), a founding father of the Plymouth Brethren Church in England, is the guy who has received the most attention for teaching the Pre)Trib theory. Some researchers maintain that he was expressing this view as early as 1827, yet it was an article he wro te in 1850 which squarely places him in the Pre)Trib corner:"},{"pageNumber":681,"pageContent":" “It is this passage (2 Thessalonians 2:1)2) which, twenty years ago, made me understand the rapture of the saints before– perhap s a considerable time before– the day of the Lord (that is, before the judgment o f the living.)” John Nelson Darby By his own admission, he claims 1830 as the year he gained this revelation. It is therefore believed that Darby heard it from Edward Irving (1792)1834), of the Apostolic Catholic Church; and Irving actually found out abou t it from Margaret Macdonald (c. 1815)40), a 15)year old, chronically sick girl from Port Glasgow, Scotland, a member of his church (along with her sister and brothers) who apparently manifested the charismatic gifts of prophecy, speaking in tongues, and visions. After being sick for a year and a half, and a Christian for only a year, i n the spring of 1830 she had a vision, which she gave copies of to various clerical leader s, including Irving. The most unique part of her long, scripture)laden m essage, was the earliest known documentation of the Pre)Tribulation theory: “Only those who have the light of God within them will see the sign of his appearance. No need to follow them who say, see here, or see there, for his day shall be as the lig htning to those in whom the living Christ is. ‘Tis Christ in us that will lift us up– he is t he light– ‘tis only those that are alive in him that will be caught up to meet him in the air.” Macdonald’s vision was first published in 1840 by D r. Robert Norton (who heard and recorded the words in person), a long)time friend o f the family, in the book Memoirs of James & George Macdonald, of Port-Glasgow , a biography of her older brothers. Norton quoted a May 18, 1830 letter written by Marg aret’s older sister Mary that indicated that “the house has been filled with peop le every day from all parts of England, Scotland, and Ireland,” listening to her e xpound on the Rapture and end)time events. He did not attribute the vision to Margaret until his 1861 book The Restoration of Apostles and Prophets; In the Catholic Apostolic Ch urch . He said that during her long convalescence she had access to her family’s “extensive library” which could have included Bible s like the Self Interpreting Bible (1778), and the Columbian Family Bible (1822) which contained cross references and marginal notes similar to that in study Bibles; as well as a host of other sources which"},{"pageNumber":682,"pageContent":"MacPherson believes could have been used as a basis to develop her idea. In the March, 1830 edition of The Morning Watch , a quarterly prophecy magazine that Irving edited, he wrote an article that stated that the “translation of the saints taketh place C before the judgments which fall upon the ea rth at the coming of the Son of Man C just before the great consummation of wrath.” How ever, in a letter dated June 2, 1830, Irving wrote that the “substance of C Mcdonal d’s visions C carry to me a spiritual conviction and a spiritual reproof which I cannot e xpress.” In Part 1 of an article called “Commentary on the E pistles to the Seven Churches in the Apocalypse,” in the June issue of The Morning Watch , by an author who identified himself only as “Fidus,” wrote from a Post)Trib vie w. Yet, when Part 2 appeared three months later in the September, 1830 edition, he cl early elaborated a Pre)trib view when he wrote that the Philadelphia church “which receiv es the answer of its faith in being caught up to meet him; which is thus kept from the hour of temptationC” while the Laodicea Church is described as “the last and dying stage of the Gentile church, before the gathering of the JewsC” Subsequently, Dr. Cyrus I.

Will this be the source of the “falli ng away,” as those whose faith is not strong enough to endure acquiesce to the strong)arm tactics of a political leadership bent on establishing world government. Without a do ubt, this period of time will be a tremendously trying period, and I can only say that God’s word is true, and there is a place of protection.

The c ave contained many earthenware jars, about 2 feet high and 10 inches wide. Though many were broken, 9 were believed to be intact. Inside one of the jars, he discovered three leather rolls wrapped in linen. In a subsequent visit, four more leather rolls were di scovered. These rolls turned out to be ancient scrolls, which have been referred to as the ‘Dead Sea Scrolls.’ A Christian shopkeeper, Khalil Iskander Shahin (kno wn as “Kando”), and George Ishaya (Isaiah) Shamoun, members of the Syrian Jaco bite Church in Jerusalem, heard about the discovery and went to Qumran to verify th e Bedouin’s claims, finding some scroll fragments. They later met with the three she pherds to examine their findings. One of the Bedouins sold 3 of the scrolls to the Mu slim sheik of Bethlehem, and Kando purchased the other 4, which consisted of a 2 2)foot long scroll containing the entire text of the Book of Isaiah , the Genesis Apocryphon , the Habakkuk Commentary , and the Manual of Discipline (also known as the Community Rule ), which had split into two. These 4 were in turn sold to the Syrian Metrop olitan (Archbishop) Athanasius Yeshua Samuel, head of the Syrian Jacobite Church. Samuel later sent George Isaiah back to Qumran to carry out secret extensive excava tions. It is believed that other scrolls were discovered, the contents of which have not been revealed. In September, 1947, Samuel took the four scrolls to Homs (north of Damascus), Syria, where he met with the Patriarch of the Churc h. During his return trip, he again sent a team to Qumran. Samuel got in touch with Professor Eleazar Sukenik of the Hebrew University’s Department of Archaeology in order to have the age of the scrolls determined. Meanwhile, in November, 1947, Sukenik was contacted by someone identifying himself only as an Armenian antique dealer, and he was able to purchase the other three scrolls, which turned out to be The War of the Sons of Light With the Sons of Darkn ess (also called The War Scroll ), the Book of Hymns (also known as the Psalm of Thanksgiving Scroll ), and another copy of Isaiah."},{"pageNumber":685,"pageContent":"In January, 1948, Sukenik received one of Samuel’s scrolls, a copy of the Isaiah scroll, which he was able to inspect. Although he w as interested in purchasing the four scrolls, he couldn’t raise the money necessary to m ake the transaction. Samuel then contacted the William F. Albright Insti tute of Archaeological Research in Jerusalem, where the scrolls were inspected by J ohn C. Trever and William H. Brownlee, who felt they were as old, if not older, than the 2nd century Nash Papyrus fragment, which up to then, was the oldest known ex ample of Biblical Hebrew. A set of prints were forwarded to Professor William Foxwell Albright at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, who was the leading Hebrew epigraphist in the world. He dated the material back to 100 BC. Upon examination of al l these Hebrew and Aramaic scrolls and fragments which have been discovered at Qumran, it is generally accepted that they were written between 250 BC and 68 AD, when th e Romans destroyed the Qumran settlement. The scrolls were taken to a bank in Beirut, and the n in January, 1949, to a New York City bank vault. Up to 1954, only three of the scro lls had been published. Samuel, labeled a ‘smuggler,’ was anxious to sell the scrol ls, and would not allow the fourth to be published until all of them had been purchased. In February, 1949, Gerald Lankester Harding, direct or of the Department of Antiquities for Transjordan and Arab Palestine; and Father Roland de Vaux, director of the Dominican)controlled Ecole Biblique in the Jord anian sector of East Jerusalem, went to the cave at Qumran, where they found the re mains of 30 identifiable texts, and a number of unidentifiable fragments. Harding made it known that he was interested in all subsequent finds made by the Ta’amireh tribe. T hey would sell the results of their excavation to Kando, who would then sell the items to Harding. Meanwhile, de Vaux, Harding, and a group of fifteen workers continued t o excavate around Qumran until 1956, where they uncovered the buildings of what th ey felt were an Essene community. Roland de Vaux For nearly two weeks in mid)March, 1952, de Vaux, t hree members of the Ecole Biblique, William Reed (director of the Albright In stitute), and 24 Bedouins under the supervision of three Jordanian and Palestinian arch aeologists, embarked on an effort to conduct a survey of all the caves in the area. This survey indicated the existence of 40 caves, and the umbrella term of the Dead Sea Scroll s refers to the scrolls and"},{"pageNumber":686,"pageContent":"fragments that were found in eleven of the caves. In September, 1952, in Cave 4, located about 50 fee t away from some of the Qumran ruins, the largest number of scroll fragment s were discovered– the remains of over 500 different scrolls. By 1959, all the scroll fragments were kept in a ro om known as the ‘Scrollery’ in the Rockefeller Museum (formerly known as the Palestine Archaeological Museum), which had been built with funds provided by John D. Rocke feller. The Museum was run by an international Board of Trustees, and later fell und er the control of the Jordanian government. After the Six Day War in June, 1967, wh en Israel took over control of the entire city of Jerusalem, the contents of the Museu m were considered spoils of war, so the Israeli government became the guardian of the f ragments. The Museum contained laboratories, photographic fac ilities, and the Department of Antiquities, however, the headquarters of the entir e operation was actually located at the Ecole Biblique which contained a research libra ry totally dedicated to Qumran research, which was not open to the public. They al so published two journals, the Revue Biblique , printed since 1892, and the Revue de Qumran , started in 1958 to publish information on the scrolls. This may be one of the keys to understanding what m ay be going on here behind the scenes. In 1882, on the site where, according t o tradition, St. Stephen, the first Christian martyr was stoned to death, a French Domi nican monk established a Dominican church and monastery in Jerusalem. At the urging of Pope Leo XIII, a Biblical school was begun there in 1890 by Father A lbert Lagrange to train scholars with the knowledge necessary to protect the Church again st the potential of damaging archaeological discoveries. Originally known as the Ecole Practique d ́Etudes Bibliques, it was later renamed the Ecole Biblique et Archeolo gique Francaise de Jerusalem. Leo XIII Lagrange became a member of the Pontifical Biblical Commission, which had been started by Pope Leo to ‘monitor’ the work of Cathol ic scriptural scholarship. In 1956, de Vaux became a consultant to this Commission until h is death in 1971, as did his successors Father Pierre Benoit, and Jean)Luc Vesco in 1987. The head of the Pontifical Biblical Commission is Cardinal Joseph R atzinger who is also the executive head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Fa ith, which prior to 1965 had been"},{"pageNumber":687,"pageContent":"known as the Holy Office; and prior to 1542, as the Holy Inquisition. After 1971, with many common members, the two groups were virtually combined, sharing the same offices at the Palace of the Congregation at the Ho ly Office Square in Rome. Because of this connection, the implication had been made t hat the Vatican was exerting influence over the Scrolls, in order to control wha t information is released. The team that de Vaux chose in 1953, to assemble an d translate the Scrolls were primarily Catholic: 1) Frank Cross: Harvard Professor, of the McCormick Theological Seminary in Chicago and the Albright Institute in Jerusalem. Th e only Protestant on the team. 2) Monsignor Patrick Skehan: From the United States , who was director of the Albright Institute. He was quoted as saying that th e Biblical scholar should adhere to Church doctrine and “be subject always to the sovereign right of the Holy Mother Church to witness definitively what is in fact concordant with the teaching she has received from Christ.” When he die d in 1980, he was replaced by Professor Eugene Ulrich of Notre Dame University . 3) Father Jean Starcky: From France, who, after his death, was replaced by Father Emile Puech of the Ecole Biblique. 4) Dr. Claus)Hunno Hunzinger: From Germany, who was later replaced by a French priest, Father Maurice Baillet. 5) Father Josef Milik: A priest from Poland. 6) John M. Allegro: An ex)Methodist turned agnostic from Oxford, who revealed that certain material was being kept secret because of the controversial nature, and de Vaux did not want the Church to be embarrass ed. He was replaced by Oxford Professor John Strugnell, who in 1960 became Assistant Professor of Old Testament Studies at Duke University; and in 1968 b ecame the Professor of Christian Origins at the Harvard Divinity School.  Patrick Skehan  Eugene Ulrich  Jean Starcky After de Vaux’s death in 1971, his handpicked succe ssor was another Dominican, Father Pierre Benoit, who became the head of the Ec ole Biblique and the overseer of the international team, until his death in 1987. St rugnell, who converted to Catholicism, then became the leader of the team."},{"pageNumber":688,"pageContent":"As you can see, this small group of Catholic schola rs had complete control of all of the Dead Sea Scroll fragments that were found. In 1954, Yigael Yadin, the former Chief of Staff fo r the Israeli Defense Forces, who taught Archaeology at Hebrew University, purchased Samuel’s four scrolls for $250,000. Ironically, he was the son of Professor S ukenik. These four scrolls, and the three purchased by his father were then housed in a building known as the Shrine of the Book. While the Israelis worked on these scrolls, a cross town at the Rockefeller Museum, de Vaux and his group of international scho lars were working on the fragments they discovered. Yigael Yadin In 1967, Yadin interrogated Kando, who subsequently relinquished possession of a scroll he had for six years, which had been found i n Cave 11. Known as the Temple Scroll, at 27 feet, it is the longest scroll, and h as been dated between 150)125 BC. It has references to the building of the Temple in Jer usalem, and the rituals to be performed there, however, because of the laws found in it in regard to general matters, and quotes from the Pentateuch (the first 5 books o f the Bible, known as the Torah of Moses), it has been referred to as the Sixth Book o f the Law, and may contain the information referred to in 1 Chronicles 28:11)19 an d 1 Samuel 8:11. The Pentateuch was compiled by Ezra (Ezra 7:14) abo ut 458 BC, and it is believed that what was edited out, became part of the Temple Scroll. Five separate sources were compiled to form the Temple Scroll, and it is now c onsidered a supplement to the Torah. In addition to the content, another reason that it is considered a Biblical text, is that in all established Biblical books, the name of God, YHWH ( Yahweh), is written in the square Aramaic script like the rest of the text; while in non)Biblical writings, the name is written in Paleo)Hebrew, while the rest of the text is in A ramaic. The goal of de Vaux’s international team was for th e Oxford University Press to publish all Qumran scrolls by 1962 in a series call ed the Discoveries in the Judaean Desert of Jordan . That didn’t happen. The first, in 1955, contained the fragments found in the original cave, known as Cave 1. In 1961, the second volume appeared, however, it contained material discovered in the four caves of Wadi Murabba’at, eleven miles south of Qumran, and was dated from 70)135 AD. This find included the Hebrew"},{"pageNumber":689,"pageContent":"versions of all the minor prophets, including Hosea , Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zecharia h, and Malachi. In 1963, the third volume was published, containing fragments fr om Cave 2, Cave 3, and Caves 5 ) 10; including the Copper Scroll found in Cave 3, an d fragments from two copies of The Book of Jubilees , a copy of which was later found at Masada. Some r esearchers believe that the Copper scroll should be put in a different category, and separated from the other texts that have been found, because it is the only document that was recorded on metal, it was written in a different variation of H ebrew, and was discovered in an isolated section of the cave; which could indicate a different origin. The fourth volume, in 1965, was a collection of Psalms found in Cave 11. The fifth volume, in 1968, under the direction of Allegro, contained some material from Cave 4, however, most of the scrolls from this cave continued to be withheld from the pu blic, even though Allegro had said in 1964 that the compilation and translation had been nearly completed by 1961. The sixth installment of the series appeared in 1977, the sev enth in 1982, and the eighth, which didn’t even deal with the texts of Qumran, was rele ased in 1990. These eight volumes are said to represent only 25% of the information contained in the Scrolls, even though Father Benoit had said in December, 1985, that everything would be published by 1993. Strugnell would later s et a deadline of 1996. Then it was announced that it would be done by 2000. Edmund Wilson, author of The Scrolls of the Dead Sea , said in 1955 that de Vaux’s team wanted to isolate the sectarian non)Biblical s crolls from being connected with Christianity and Judaism, and concentrated only on the Biblical literature. In 1956, tired of de Vaux’s attempts to prevent the Scrolls from b eing linked to Christianity, John Allegro was a guest on a series of three radio show s in northern England. The third interview resulted in a New York Times article which said: “The origins of some Christian ritual and doctrines can be seen in the d ocuments of an extremist Jewish sect that existed for more than 100 years before the bir th of Jesus Christ. This is the interpretation placed on the ‘fabulous’ collection of Dead Sea Scrolls by one of an international team of seven scholars ... John Alleg ro ... (who) said last night in a broadcast that the historical basis of the Lord’s S upper and part at least of the Lord’s prayer and the New Testament teaching of Jesus were attributable to the Qumranians.” In 1987, he quit, calling the team’s delays “inexcu sable,” saying that for years they had been “sitting on material which is not only of outstanding importance, but also quite the most religiously sensitive.” He died in 1988. Robert Eisenman, a former Research Fellow at the Al bright Institute, who was a Professor of Middle East Religions and Chairman of Religious Studies at California State University at Long Beach, was denied access t o photographs of the Scroll fragments by Strugnell. In 1989, he said publicly, that during the last 40 years, all of the research on the Dead Sea Scrolls was controlled by a handful of scholars who had revealed only a small portion. He called for access to the Scrolls by qualified scholars, and for AMS (Accelerator Mass Spectroscopy) Carbon) 14 dating to be performed on the documents to verify the dating, which up to that po int had been relying on the original, obsolete form of dating, which had been done shortl y after their discovery. In April, 1989, the Israeli Archaeological Council created a Scroll Oversight Committee to oversee the publication of all Qumran texts, and to make sure the international team completed their assignments, and in July, 1989, Amir Drori, Director"},{"pageNumber":690,"pageContent":"of the Israeli Department of Antiquities, a member of that Committee, told the Los Angeles Times , that “if someone does not complete his work on ti me we have the right to deliver the scrolls to someone else.” After the Israeli government took full possession o f Jerusalem in June of 1967, many were surprised that de Vaux was allowed to continue in his capacity as the leader of the team of scholars, even though it was a known fact t hat he was anti)Semitic, which was why he would not allow any Jewish scholars into the project. In the mid)1980’s, Strugnell brought in Israeli scholar Elisha Qimron; Talmud scholar Jacob Sussman; Devorah Dimant of Haifa University; and Emmanuel To v, Shemaryahu Talmon, Joseph Baumgarten, and Jonas Greenfield, of Baltimore’s He brew University, to work on some unpublished text.   E mmanuel Tov Shemaryahu Talmon In November, 1990, without informing Strugnell, the Israeli government assigned Emmanuel Tov to become the ‘joint editor)in)chief’ of the project to finish the translation and publication of the Scrolls. Then, in December, 1990, the New York Times quoted from an October 28, 1990 interview Strugnell had wi th the Israeli paper Ha-Aretz , where he said that Judaism was a “horrible religion,” a “ racist” religion, and that Israel was “founded on a lie.” Magen Broshi, curator of Jerusa lem’s Shrine of the Book, said: “We’ve known for twenty years that he was an anti)S emite.” On another occasion, he referred to Strugnell’s “rabid anti)Semitism.” Thes e anti)Semitic comments resulted in him being dismissed from the project as editor)in)c hief, even though he still controlled his portion of the texts. Tov became chief editor, along with Professor Eugene Ulrich and Emile Puech. "},{"pageNumber":691,"pageContent":"   Em ile Puech Ben)Zion Wacholder In September, 1991, Professor Ben)Zion Wacholder, a nd one of his doctoral students, Martin G. Abegg, from Hebrew Union Colleg e in Cincinnati, Ohio, released their compilation of the Qumran texts, which was pu blished by the Biblical Archaeological Society. In 1988, Strugnell had prin ted 30 copies of a 52,000 word concordance of words found in the scroll, which had been created by de Vaux’s team in the 1950’s, so it could be used by the team. Wachol der and Abegg used a computer to reconstruct these words, and it was purported to be 80% accurate. Later that month, the Huntington Library in San Marine, California reveal ed that it had a complete set of negatives, from photographs, of photographs of the original scrolls, which had been given to them in 1987 by Elizabeth Hay Bechtel of t he Bechtel Corporation, who had founded the Ancient Biblical Manuscript Center in C laremont, California (who also had a copy). They made microfilm copies available to any scholar who requested it. The Hebrew Union College also have a partial set; and t he Oxford Centre for Postgraduate Hebrew Studies in England has a full set, which had been given to them in May, 1991, by the Israeli Oversight Committee. The Qumran texts, written in Hebrew and Aramaic, ar e believed to have been written between 250 BC and 68 AD. They have been divided in to two groups – Biblical and non)Biblical. About 20% are Biblical. Copies of eve ry book in the Hebrew Bible have been found, except for Esther (which, coincidentall y, was the only book that didn’t mention the name of God). In Cave 4, one of the mos t complete manuscripts which they have been able to reconstruct, is the First Book of Samuel, which was found to contain passages not contained in our Bible, and is being u sed to fill in some of the narrative gaps. The non)Biblical fragments consist of hymns a nd psalms, biblical commentaries, legal documents, a letter, apocryphal writings, and an inventory of the Temple treasure. Of the non)Biblical, there are texts referred to as sectarian writings, which were produced by a unique sect of Jews who have been ide ntified as the Essenes. The seven intact scrolls that were found in Cave 1, were quickly published by Israeli and American scholars, but the fragments collected by de Vaux were a different story. Just in Cave 4, there was believed to be well over 15,000 fragments (and perhaps as many as 100,000) from 500 different manuscripts. In all, the find was said to represent about 800 manuscripts. Of the Biblical writings, 25 copies of Deuteronomy were found,"},{"pageNumber":692,"pageContent":"18 copies of Isaiah , and 27 copies of the Psalter . Among the non)Biblical, 11 copies of the Community Rule , 9 Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice , 8 of the Thanksgiving Hymn , and 7 of the Sons of Light Against the Sons of Darkness . Prior to the discovery of the Scrolls, the oldest k nown Old Testament texts were copies which dated back to 1100 AD, yet they were n early identical. Originally, only the linen surrounding the scrolls were tested with the Carbon)14 dating process, which indicated a date around the 2nd century BC and the beginning of the 1st century AD. In 1991, new tests by a Swiss laboratory confirmed the se results. A palaeographical analysis was done on the script used in writing the texts which revealed a similarity to styles that were used from 250 ) 150 BC, 150 ) 30 B C, and 30 BC ) 70 AD. Archaeological dating was also done with the help o f several hundred coins which were found in the Qumran complex. The earliest structure s were built between 130 ) 110 BC, then rebuilt and enlarged from 110) 40 BC. They dis covered evidence of an earthquake which had been recorded as occurring in 31 BC, afte r which they rebuilt the settlement and occupied it until 68 AD when it was destroyed b y Vespasian’s Roman legions. During the Maccabean period, in the 2nd century BC, there were three main Jewish groups, the Pharisees, the Sadduccees, and the Esse nes. The Essenes were known to be the ‘strict’ Order. Early historians, such as Pl iny the Elder (the 1st century Roman writer), Josephus, and Philo, indicated that the Es senes lived in the area between Jericho and Ein Gedi, on the shores of the Dead Sea , which is where the Qumran ruins are located. The Sadducees, whose religious principles differed from the Pharisees, separated from them after the Maccabean revolt (168)164 BC). A document identified as Miqsat Ma’aseh he-Torah , or Some Rulings Pertaining to the Torah (also known as the Halakhic Letter ), which was found in Cave 4, contains about 22 rel igious laws, and appears to be the basis of the Qumran philosophy. D iscovered in 1952, its contents weren’t revealed until 1984, and it has led some re searchers to believe that the Qumran group seceded from the established religious center in Jerusalem, and became the group known as the Essenes. Yet the Essene name is never used. How this break occurred is not really known. Accord ing to one theory, when Judea, under Judas Maccabeus, revolted in 165 BC against t he Syrian tyrant King Antiochus IV, thus beginning the Hasmonean line of Kings with Judas (165)160 BC), his brother Jonathan (160)143 BC), then his brother Simon (143) 134 BC), maintained a friendly relationship with Rome; and in 152 BC when Jonathan made himself the High Priest, this upset the hardline Jews who chose to follow a man they referred to as the “Teacher of Righteousness,” who was of the Zadokite (who wer e descendants of the priestly line of Aaron) line. They went to the desert where they could observe the laws of God. A document found at Qumran was an earlier version o f the Damascus Document , which was discovered (2 copies) in a Cairo synagogu e in 1896. Dated between 80 ) 75 BC, a copy was found in Cave 6, and 7 copies in Cav e 4. The fragments recovered at Qumran have proven the Cairo text to be incomplete. The text refers to a contingent of Jews that remained faithful to the Law. A ‘Teacher of Righteousness’ came to them, and led them into Damascus so they could renew their ‘C ovenant’ with God. This Covenant is referred to in the Community Rule . It is believed that there was an Essene community in Damascus. In the book of the Acts of the Apostle s, Saul was going to Damascus to persecute these early Christians."},{"pageNumber":693,"pageContent":"Another theory says that after the destruction of t he First Temple in 586 BC, when the Jews were exiled to Babylon, the Essenes were f ormed as a strict Order because they believed they were being punished by God for t heir disobedience. When the Jews returned to Jerusalem after the Maccabean victories , they became disenchanted and went to Qumran. It was believed that the Essenes were a pacifist, m onastic Order who wanted to separate themselves from the revolutionary)minded Z ealots, yet some of the evidence seems to indicate otherwise. Originally thought to have been celibate, the graves of two women and a child were discovered; plus the Community Rule contained marriage laws. The Essenes did not engage in animal sacrific e, yet the Temple Scroll contains instructions for such rituals, and animal bones hav e been found. Thought to have been peaceful, their scrolls seem to indicate the knowle dge of military strategy; and the ruins of a military defense tower and a forge have been e xcavated. Several manuscripts from Qumran, were also found at the Zealot stronghold on Masada, and there has been some researchers who believe that there was a conne ction between the two groups. While de Vaux and his team were trying to distance the Scrolls from Judaism and Christianity, saying there were no connections, the texts which were already published seem to indicate otherwise. Either the early Christ ians were just living at the Qumran community, or the early Christians and the Qumran c ommunity were one and the same. Though Essene in nature, the group in Qumran has be en compared to the early Church which was based in Jerusalem. The Habakkuk Commenta ry said that Qumran’s governing body, the Council of the Community, was i n Jerusalem. In fact, it is believed that the scrolls were taken to Qumran from Jerusale m for protection. Professor Norman Golb of the University of Chicago has theorized tha t the Scrolls were from the library of the Jewish Temple, and taken to Qumran, a military installation, during the first Jewish revolt to keep them safe. The vital link for this b elief comes from the Copper scroll, which lists 64 locations of hidden Temple treasure. This seems to indicate that perhaps the Qumran settlement was a retreat for the early C hristians. But wait, ‘Christians’ before Christ? This is one of the controversial dev elopments that have emerged from the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls. The New Testament was written in Greek, and Jesus s poke in Aramaic. The Qumran texts are written in Hebrew and sometimes Ar amaic, and has been shown to contain information that is echoed in the New Testa ment. Prior to the discovery of the Scrolls, the teachings of Jesus had been considered as original, though influenced by Old Testament teaching. However, the Qumran documen ts now indicate the existence of a basis for His message. The Community Rule , which was discovered in Cave 1, has proven to be one of the most important discoveries in Qumran. It is a record of the rules and regulations of the Qumran community, where all must make a “Covenant before God to obey all his commandments.” One of the basic tenets of Christianity, the baptism of purification, is discussed. It says that the con vert “shall be cleansed from all his sins by the spirit of holiness uniting him to its truth ... And when his flesh is sprinkled with purifying water and sanctified by cleansing water, it shall be made clean by the humble submission of his soul to all the precepts of God.” This has led to the theory that John the Baptist had lived at Qumran until he was called by God to be the forerunner of Jesus. Author Charles Francis Potter, in his book The Lost Years of Jesus , attempted to explain the “eighteen silent years” of Jesus, betwe en the ages of 12 and 30, as being"},{"pageNumber":694,"pageContent":"spent at Qumran. In the Acts of the Apostles (Acts 2:44)46), it says : “And all that believed were together, and had all things in common; And sold th eir possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need. And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple...” This shows that common own ership was part of the early Christian philosophy. The Community Rule stated: “All ... shall bring all their knowledge, powers and possessions into the Community...”; “The y shall eat in common and pray in common...” and “...his property shall be merged and he shall offer his counsel and judgment to the Community.” Also in Acts, the Church leadership is shown to be made up of twelve Apostles, which according to Galatians, were led by James (th e brother of Jesus), John and Peter. In the Community Rule , the Qumran group were governed by a ‘Council’ of twelve people, with three priests that were in lead ership roles, though it is not known if they were part of the twelve. It also talks about a ‘Meal of the Congregation’ wh ich is a ritual very much like the ‘Last Supper’ and the subsequent communion ceremony ; while other documents contain parallels with the Sermon on the Mount, and the concept of the battle between the darkness and the light. The Qumran texts contain references to what’s been identified as a messianic figure known as the “Teacher of Righteousness,” which some have tried to identify as being Jesus, however, there are no references as to the d ivinity of this person, so it couldn’t be Jesus. In addition, because of the age of the do cument, this person would have been living well before the time of Christ. However, rec ently released fragments do allude to Jesus. An unpublished Aramaic scroll fragment out o f Cave 4, mention the “Son of God” and the “Son of the Most High,” in a similar manner as Luke 1:32, 35. It is the first time these references have appeared in any outside text. Newly released fragments out of Cave 4 even prophecy the coming the coming of Jesus , as the Messiah. Fragment 4Q285 said that a “staff shall rise from the root o f Jesse ... the Branch of David ... and they will put to death the Leader of the Community. ” Fragment 4Q521 said: “The Heavens and the earth will obey his Messiah ... He will not turn aside from the Commandments of the Holy Ones ... For the Lord will visit the Pious Ones and the Righteous will call by name ... He shall release th e captives, make the blind to see, raise up the downtrodden ... He will heal the sick, resurrect the dead, and to the Meek announce glad tidings.” Much has been made about this small group of men, w ho for forty years had been silent about the contents of the Dead Sea Scrolls w hich were in their possession. With some being considered as emissaries of the Catholic Church, was it because the Scrolls are contrary to the Bible in respect to the origin of Christianity, or was it, as some maintain, because of the power it gave them; or, as Randall Price maintains (in his book Secrets of the Dead Sea Scrolls ), is all of this talk just an effort to prevent se rious consideration of the Scrolls as verification and co rroboration of the Bible. Price quotes Professor Tov who said: “I would compl etely brush aside any accusations of suppressed material. There is no evi dence whatsoever for this having been done by any Catholic source.” He also quotes J oseph A. Fitzmyer, a Catholic scholar, and member of the Scroll team who said: “T he whole idea of a Vatican conspiracy to suppress the Scrolls that it (the boo k The Dead Sea Scrolls Deception by"},{"pageNumber":695,"pageContent":"Baigent and Leigh) portrays is ludicrous nonsense.” Randall Price then proceeds to completely unravel the whole conspiratorial argumen t behind the delays as being because of the “condition of the texts C accessibil ity of the materials C the political situation C the nature of the text assignments C sc holastic responsibilities C financial problems C (and) human problems.” His argument is j ust as convincing. My concern is that, where there is smoke, there may also be fire. Any kind of association with the Rockefeller name brings with i t the influence of the ecumenical movement; and any kind of connection to Catholicism brings with it the baggage of their pagan origins (see my on)line book Controlled by the Calendar ). Many eminent scholars have tried to make a connection between the Scrolls and the Essenes, even when the evidence for this is circumstantial at best. As I w ill discuss in the next chapter, those who have tried to prove that Jesus faked his crucif ixion have also tried to link him with the Essenes. Even though the Scrolls themselves ind icate that the inhabitants of Qumran engaged in the study of astrology and mystic ism, this group has been identified as the starting point for the philosophy which beca me Christianity. So, if we are to believe some of the interpretations of the Scrolls, that the teachings of Jesus were based on the philosophy of the Essenes; this seriou sly damages His image as being the father of a Religion that bears His name. Not only that, but it further diminishes His divinity, which has increasingly come under attack. When the last remnants of the Scrolls are published , those discovered so far, and those yet to be discovered, some scholars have expr essed a wish for new versions of the Bible to reflect the ‘new’ information gleaned from the Scrolls. If this happens, will the new material be used to buttress the scriptures as being Holy Spirit inspired) or will they take on the spin of a pre)Christ Christianity, and further contribute to the taking of Christ out of the Christianity of main)line churche s, so that the role of Jesus is reduced to that of just a teacher or a political visionary. Since I believe that Jesus taught only what was giv en unto Him through the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, what legitimacy sho uld be given to the Dead Sea Scrolls, if any. Beyond a shadow of a doubt, they are legitimate doc uments, and not the result of an incredible forgery, as far as being done shortly be fore their discovery. Therefore, we have to look in another direction. Now that other s cholars have access to them, I would think that any incorrect translations would be revi sed; which brings us to the reconstruction of the actual fragments themselves. We have been forced to rely on the accuracy of de Vaux’s team, and their ability to fi t the quagmire of pieces together into some sort of coherency. It would seem that gaps in the assembled fragments of text (especially in the case of the Essene documents) wo uld make it difficult to actually grasp its full meaning, especially since missing wo rds may have a bearing on how other words are translated. The complex techniques utiliz ed in this process have brought very little criticism in regard to its accuracy. Another point of contention is the procedure used t o date the Scrolls. Carbon)14 dating has long been criticized as being inaccurate . Originally only the wrapping around them were tested, because they didn’t want to destr oy any text in order to date them. However, new techniques need less material to achie ve the same results. But remember, what is being dated is the material that was written on. If a fragment was dated back to 200 BC, there is no way of knowing wh ether it was actually written on at"},{"pageNumber":696,"pageContent":"that time, or maybe 300 years later. This knowledge makes it difficult to assume the accuracy of any dating. We must also take into account, whether or not a do cument is describing actual events, or if it is just plain fiction. For example , it is commonly accepted that some apocryphal books such as Tobit , and Bel and the Dragon were works of fiction, and for that reason were not included in the Bible. Many ap ocryphal writings were found at Qumran. When it comes to analyzing the contents of a text, how do you decide that it is a historically accurate document, if you don’t know the intention of the writer, or even who the writer was. Just as the writers of the Gosp els have been accused of embellishment, do some of the Qumran texts contain embellishments. Because of the initial secrecy surrounding the Scro lls, how will we really know that all of the fragments found, will be released. It wa s said that some fragments had been taken to the Ecole Biblique. Were they ever returne d to the Rockefeller Museum? I guess, what I am thinking here, is that if they had discovered something that would have shaken the very foundation of the Christian Church, would the Scroll team have allowed it to remain, or would it have found its way into t he dark recesses of the Vatican, never again to see the light of day, or perhaps only lock ed away for a short time, to be released when the time is right. As Price maintains, there may very well be nothing to the negative slant that has been applied to the Scrolls; and yet, it is very ha rd not to think conspiratorially because of all the circumstances surrounding them. I believ e that the Scrolls are part of the ‘last days’ trigger, and as such, I believe that they are going to be used in some way to perpetuate an end)time deception. In addition, how about the existence of other scrol ls which haven’t made their way into official hands so they can scrutinized by scho lars. Strugnell revealed the existence of four other scrolls from Cave 11. Of the two he s aw, one was a complete copy of the Book of Enoch . On his deathbed, Lankester Harding, the director of Jordan’s Department of Antiquities, claimed to have seen two more scrolls that Strugnell had not seen. All four are located in Jordan. Stories have also circulated about Bedouin discoveries which were not given to de Vaux, and ha ve yet to surface. Plus there have been other optimistic forays into the area which co uld eventually turn up more scrolls or fragments. In one case, archaeologists Dr. Gary Col lett and Dr. Aubry L. Richardson, using sophisticated equipment developed by NASA (wh ich can sense non)visible elements of the electromagnetic spectrum and interp ret the type of molecules found in its makeup), claimed that there were still unexplor ed caves, including one which may contain up to 40 intact jars, of the kind used to store manuscripts, and evidence of another copper scroll. A dig was initiated, sanctio ned by the Israeli government, to reach this cave, which had not turned up anything. My feeling is that there hasn’t been enough substan tiation from the Scrolls to make the kind of claims that have been made. For example , various books in the Bible contain the same information, and are used to cross referen ce each other; and that wasn’t possible with the Scrolls, so, because of that, sho uld their scholarship be accepted, especially when some of the rituals that are simila r to the early Christian Church may be nothing more than natural progression– or theologic al evolution. Because of further archaeological excavation, we ma y continue to get a steady flow of information from Qumran for years to come, and h ow it will affect the perception of"},{"pageNumber":697,"pageContent":"Christianity is yet to be seen. All we can do is to evaluate what is available now, and how some of the questionable texts may be use to ma nipulate religion in this country.

SATANISM The underlying power to all occult practices, is Sa tanism– the worship of Satan (or Lucifer) in opposition to the worship of God. It is the worship of Satan which has been the driving force behind the handful of men who hav e perpetuated the I Iluminati conspiracy. It has been reported that the spread of the occult has been the job of an inner circle of the I Iluminati, which is known as the Council of 13, or the Grand Druid Council.

George Bush displays “horned” Satanic handsign The Druids The occult movement basically began with the Druids , who were found among the ancient Celts (the people of Gaul in France, Switze rland, Belgium, Bohemia, Galicia in Spain, as well as Galatia in what is now known as T urkey), and the forerunners of those living today in the British Isles, Scotland, and Ir eland. Their culture flourished for hundreds of years before the Christian era, peaking around 1200 BC, when they became caught up between the encroachment of the Ro man Empire and the invasions from barbaric Germanic tribes. "},{"pageNumber":699,"pageContent":" Druids worship at an oak tree The Druids were members of a priesthood who came fr om the upper class of Celtic society, and were exempt from taxes and manual labo r. Their name comes from the Celtic word ‘daur’ which means ‘oak tree,’ which wa s sacred to them; and in the Gaelic, it means “knowing the oak tree.” They performed the ir rituals and ceremonies in sacred oak groves, as well as river sources and lakes, bec ause they also considered water to be sacred. Around 98)180 AD, the Druid religion was outlawed, and they were forced to go underground, where it has been secretly active, in various forms, ever since. The earliest mention of these “men of the oak,” was in the 3rd century BC, from Julius Caesar, and what little information that is available, comes from 30 references in Greek and Roman writings from the second century BC to the fourth century AD, and ancient records found in Ireland. For the most part , their legacy has been passed down orally from generation to generation, because they considered it “profane” to write down their teachings. In the writings of an ancient Greek, he compared th e Druids to the Magi of Persia, who were the group from which the Wise Men came. Th ey could also be compared to the Medicine Man of the American Indians. In fact, I kind of thought they might have been a Satanic perversion of the Levite tribe of Is rael, from which came the priests. An aura of mystery surrounded the Druids, and they were considered evil. It was alleged that they possessed strange powers, such as being able to produce mists, storms, floods, and cast spells. As it turned out, there was reason to fear these men, because some of their rituals included both animal and human sacrifice. "},{"pageNumber":700,"pageContent":" Druids performing a ritual at Stonehenge The Druids worshipped the Sun God, Hu; the moon, an d the stars. Many of their rites centered around such astronomical occurrences as equinoxes and solstices. It is believed that Stonehenge, built in 2750 BC on the S alisbury Plain in southwest England, and transformed into a solar observatory by 1900 BC , was later used by the Druids as a temple for sacrifices. A similar structure in Avebu ry, 20 miles north, was also used. Their biggest night of the year, was the ceremony k nown as the ‘Vigil of Samhein,’ on October 31st, in honor of Samhein, the Horned Hu nter of the Night (Satan, as seen in the Pentagram), the Oak God of the Underworld, a nd the God of the Dead. It is this ritual that evolved into the annual tradition of Ha lloween. "},{"pageNumber":701,"pageContent":" Witchcraft is a pagan nature)worshipping religion Witchcraft The lineal successor to the religion of the Druids was British witchcraft, which became strong in the 1200’s, and considers itself t o be the world’s oldest religion. The word Witchcraft is derived from the Anglo)Saxon wor d ‘wiccecraeft’ (‘wicca)craft’) or “craft of the wise.” Witchcraft Pentagram Witches say that their religion is not anti)Christi an, because they worship deities that were in existence before the advent of the Christia n era. They worship nature and earth, and as polytheists, they believe this power to be m anifested in the form of various gods and goddesses. In this pluralistic system, there is a Mother (Moon) goddess, who controls fertility rites, and the process of birth and life; and also a horned god, who represents the masculine side of nature. Known as C ernunnos, the god of hunting, fertility, and wild animals, he is the god of the u nderworld who controls the gates of life and death. Even though witches say that they don’t believe in Satan, unknown to them, this ‘horned hunter of the night’ is a descendant of Nim rod, who became the sun god, and"},{"pageNumber":702,"pageContent":"was the symbolic representation of Satan. You must remember, that Nimrod, and his wife, Semiramis, were the prototypes for all gods a nd goddesses that permeated all subsequent cultures and societies. According to former witches and Satanists, the deit ies that witches worship are actually demons. One thing that a lot of people try to do, is to pig eonhole witchcraft into one single category, and you can’t do it. Within the realm of Christianity, you have many religions, such as Catholics, Lutherans, Methodists, Baptists, Presbyterians, etc. And within each of these, you have a further breakdown, which divid es the various churches according to their own variations in philosophies. Well, sinc e Witchcraft is a religion, the same divisions also exist. There are different denominat ions, so)to)speak. The terms most used are White and Black Witchcraft, Traditional (w ho believe power must be inherited through family lineage), Modernist, Gardnerian (rev ival of the ‘old religion’ established by anthropologist Gerald Gardner), and Alexandrian (offshoot of the Gardnerian tradition by Alexander Sanders). But there are many others. White Sorcery is practiced out of the La Clavicule de Solomon ( The Key of Solomon ), which was said to be written by King Solomon, bu t was actually written in the 14th or 15th century. The Lemegeton ( Lesser Key ) is known as the Book of Shadows . Black Magic comes from the 6th and 7th Book of Mose s, mistakenly alleged to have been written by Moses. There has been a connotation of evil given to witch craft as a whole, but it can’t be as easily defined as that, because there are some gray areas that require an understanding. I am not condoning any aspect of wit chcraft, but I do have to be fair. The most well)known of the witchcraft sects are the Wiccans, who represent what could be considered White Witchcraft. I have talked to some Wiccans, and they do not fit the stereotype that one expects to find when th ey meet a witch. They do not dress in all black, and in fact, do not dress any differentl y than anyone else. You have probably talked to a witch, and never even knew it. As serious as you may be about your religion, and f aith; they are just as serious about their religion. Besides their holy days, some covens even have weekly meetings, just like a traditional church. Wiccans have become more open in their religion in the past few years, as they try to dispel the myth, fear, and discrimination that s urround them. In August, 1995, our local paper had a front page a rticle about a couple local witches, and how their religious activities were ju st like anyone else’s. They have distanced themselves from Satanism, by emphasizing that they don’t believe in Satan or demons. They have tried to separate themselves from the dark side of the occult, by saying that it is against their religion to harm an yone, that they’re not out there trying to get people, by putting curses on them. In fact, the ir primary directive (known as the Witch’s Rede) is: “An it harm none– do what thou wi lt.” This gives them the freedom to do what they want, just as long as it doesn’t affec t the rights of others, or cause physical harm. And indeed, Wiccans have gone out of their way to h elp people. Out of their yearning to help, many enter helping professions, s uch as social workers, nurses, and counselors. They also do tarot card readings, and a re the driving force behind the onslaught of the psychic phone hot lines."},{"pageNumber":703,"pageContent":"Thousands have been drawn to the spiritualistic asp ects of witchcraft, and it is estimated that there could be as many as 800,000 Wi ccans in this country, and since 1987, they have “grown tremendously.” They are out there spreading their word through books in secular bookstores, occult bookstores, cla sses, and pagan festivals. They are filling what they see as a void, and are presenting a religion that is more accepting of women in leadership positions, gays, interracial co uples and unmarried couples. It is marked by solemn ritualistic ceremonies that makes one feel like they’re part of a family; and a religion that offers real power. We live in a time where the constitutional right of religious freedom has forced us to tolerate and accept any religion, no matter how for eign it is to our belief system, and how contrary it is to the Bible. But on the other h and, in a growing anti)Christian climate in this country, we are also being allowed to exerc ise our faith because of those same rights. So, we have a responsibility to treat someo ne else’s beliefs with respect, because they have the same rights we do. However, I don’t have to agree with them, or like it, and I don’t have to allow this false doctr ine to permeate our society unanswered. No matter how honorable Wiccans intentions are, as a Christian, I must abide by the tenets of the Holy Scriptures in my assessment of t heir religion and practices. Do I hate them. No. In fact, the witches that I talked to wer e very pleasant, very nice, and very respectful of my religious beliefs. Which is more t han I can say about some Jehovah Witnesses and Mormons that have come knocking on my door. It is very easy to forget a very fundamental Biblical teaching, that we must hate the sin, but love the sinner. God loves everyone, even a witch. So as a Christian, we need to let witches know, if ever given the opportunity, that they are living a lie. That the gods and goddesses they are worshipping do not exist, and that they have been d eceived by a very real Satan, who is the father of lies. As I said earlier, witches have a golden rule that prohibits them from hurting anyone. But, not all witches are ‘good’ witches. And not al l witches share that philosophy. Irene Park, a former witch, and author of the book The Witch Who Switched , said the worst thing she had ever done to someone was to “demolish them. To see them removed off the face of the earth.” She further elaborated: “Yo u can kill them, or else they will commit suicide ... you drive them to do that ... yo u can do it by thought ... or something like making a potion ... and chanting and doing an incantation, and it works, the spirits work.” Chapter Six of the book Mastering Witchcraft: A Practical Guide for Witches , Warlocks and Covens is called “Vengeance and Attack.” On page 196 it s ays: “With all the power of your imagination, and all the faith an d intent you can muster, you must actually try to see your spell working its mischief , visualizing your victim suffering all the pangs you wish on him. This type of spell is perhap s best employed for encouraging general misfortune rather than any specific disaste r...” It goes on to provide actual instructions and incantations for various curses. Now, this book was written by a well)known witch na med Paul Huson, a Traditionalist from San Francisco, who studied unde r Dr. Raymond Buckland, who, as I said, is probably the leading Wiccan authority in t his country. Compare that with this, from The Satanic Bible : “Be certain you do not care if the intended victi m lives or dies, before you throw your curse, and having caused thei r destruction, revel, rather than feel remorse.” So you can see, with their own writings, regardless of any moral code they"},{"pageNumber":704,"pageContent":"claim to have, the seduction of power and the abili ty of being able to use it, may be a more overriding determinant in regard to the action s of a witch. Observing the sacred Celtic calendar of the Druids, witches have eight special holy days through the year, which are known as ‘Sabbats. ’ The April 25, 1989 edition of USA Today reported that Patricia Hutchins, a self)proclaimed Wiccan serving in the U.S. Air Force, was granted religious leave by the military to observe the eight Sabbats of her ‘religion.’ Some researchers have purported that the Sabbat is the witches sabbath, a corruption of the Jewish day of rest, Others have s aid that the word ‘sabbath’ is taken from Shabbathai, or Saturn, the planet which govern s the seventh day; while ‘sabbat’ comes from Sabadius (or Sabazius), which was the ti tle of Dionysus, the god of ecstasy, who was worshipped with partying and orgie s. However, just like the Jewish calendar, the Sabbat mirrors the Celtic day, which began at sunset, and ended the next sunset. There are two great fire festivals, known as Grand Sabbats, which divide the Celtic year in half. October 31st, Halloween (also known a s the October Festival), which celebrates the beginning of winter, and is also the beginning of the witches New Year; and April 30th, Beltane (also known as Bealtaine), which celebrates the beginning of summer. Known as the day of Bel’s fire because of t he bonfires that accompanied their fertility rituals, the Druids held this feast in ho nor of Bel, a derivative of Baal (mentioned in the Old Testament) and can be associated with Ap ollo. This day has become connected to Walpurgis Night, a festival to honor W alburga (Walpurga), the daughter of King Richard the Lion)Hearted, a nun who moved to G ermany and became abbess of the monastery of Eichstatt. After she died in 779, she was canonized by the Church, and is recognized as the protector against magic. H owever, witches are actually honoring Waldborg, a fertility goddess. The spirits of the dead are said to be very active on this day.

Anton LaVey"},{"pageNumber":705,"pageContent":"There are two other minor feasts, which divide the half)year into quarters. February 2nd, Imbolg, the Winter festival (also known as Imb olc or Oimelc), which was a pagan celebration marked with a torchlight procession to honor the various deities associated with agriculture, which was to purify and fertilize the fields prior to the planting season. As the Catholic Church Christianized pagan celebrat ions, it became known as the Feast of Purification of the Blessed Virgin Mary which is celebrated by the Roman, Creek, and Anglican churches, It is supposedly held to observe the event described in the 2nd chapter of Luke, when Mary went to the Temple for p urification, which according to tradition iy happened forty days after the birth of Jesus. It was originally observed on February 14th, when J esus was thought to have been born on the day of Epiphany. But when the date of h is birth was changed to December 25th, the day was moved. It became known as Candlem as, because church candles are blessed that day, due to Simeon’s reference to the “light to lighten the Gentiles.” It was believed that these blessed candles, when put in a home, would protect it from evil. Pope Innocent XII (1691)1700) said: “Why do we in t his feast carry candles? Because the Gentiles dedicated the month of February to the infernal gods, and at the beginning of it Pluto stole Proserpine, and her mother Ceres sought her in the night with lighted candles, so they, at the beginning of the month, wa lked about the city with lighted candles. Because the holy fathers could not extirpa te the custom, they ordained that Christians should carry about candles in honor of t he Blessed Virgin; and thus what was done before in honor of Ceres is now done in honor of the Blessed Virgin.” The other day is August 1st (July 31st according to A Witches’ Bible ) the Summer festival, when the first corn was harvested. This w as the Druid festival of Lughnasadh, which was dedicated to Lugh, the Celtic sun god. It has become known as Lammas (‘loaf)mass’). Witches celebrate this day to honor the sacred union of the goddess and the horned god. Also celebrated, to a lesser extent, are the four s olar fire festivals: The vernal equinox of March 21st (Alban Eilir, or the spring f estival), and the autumnal equinox of September 23rd (September 21st according to A Witches’ Bible , Alban Elfrad, or the autumn festival); and the two solstices (a Latin wo rd which means “the sun stops”). June 22nd (Alban Hefin, or the mid)summer night fes tival) has become associated with the eve of St. John’s Day (June 24), which is when the Feast of Saint John the Baptist is held. This is the oldest Church observan ce, and is celebrated on the day of his birth. The exact day is unknown, but the Bible indicates that he was born six months before Jesus. It became part of the mid)summer cele brations because of the summer solstice, which is the beginning of summer (June 20 ), and the longest day of the year. December 22nd, known as Yule (Alban Arthan or the m id)winter festival), has become associated with the eve of St. Thomas Day (D ecember 21), which is when the Feast of Saint Thomas is held. The observance was i nitiated in the 12th century to honor the apostle Jesus appeared to and showed his wounds after the Resurrection, because of his doubts. He is known as the patron sa int of masons and architects. It became part of the winter celebrations because of t he winter solstice, which is the beginning of winter (December 21), and the longest night of the year. Whether you know it or not, the Church of Wicca, th e largest church in the country devoted to the practice of Witchcraft, is a federal ly recognized, tax exempt, non)profit, religious organization in the United States.

Some other well)known churches are the Wicca Church of America, Church of All Worlds, Universal Church of Wicca, Aquarian Taberna cle Church, The Church of the Iron Oak, and the Church of Universal Brotherhood. Witches are so organized that they hold seminars and conventions that are publicized b y the media. In 1970, the New York City Parks Department issued a permit for the Witch es International Craft Associates (WICA) to have a “Witch)In” in Sheep Meadow on Hall oween. Over 1,000 people attended. In 1980, Joyce Clemow, a director of the New York C enter for the Strange (a non) profit research group that investigates “the myriad aspects of prognostication, prophecy, and divination”) said that among America’s practici ng witches, were three Congressmen, a syndicated financial columnist, the President of one of the nation’s banks, a well)known television newscaster, and a ma n who held a top foreign affairs position in the Nixon Administration. Margot Adler, a reporter for National Public Radio, was a well)known witch, and author of a book on neo )Paganism called Drawing Down the Moon . The Bible is very clear concerning the occult. Exod us 22:18 says: “Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.” Witchcraft practitioners c laim that this verse doesn’t refer to witchcraft, because the word “witch” is translated from the Hebrew word “chasaph” which actually means “a poisoner.” However, Strong’s Exhaustive Concordance of the Bible identifies the original word out of the Massoretic text to be “kashaph” (#3784), a root word which means to “whisper a spell, i.e. to inchant (sic) or practise (sic) ma gic.” The word “kesheph” (#3785) is magic or witchcraft, as used in 2 Kings 9:22, Micah 5:12, and Nahum 3:4; and “kashshaph” (#3786) is a magician or sorcerer. The Hebrew word “chemah” (#2534) means “poison.” Another verse that corresponds to t his sentiment can be found in Leviticus 20:27, which says: “A man also or woman t hat hath a familiar spirit, or that is a wizard, shall surely be put to death: they shall st one them with stones: their blood shall be upon them.” Jeremiah 10:2 says: “...Learn not the way of the he athen...” Deuteronomy 18:10)12 says: “There shall not be found among you anyone th at maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, or that useth divination, or an observer of times, or an enchanter, or a witch, or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard, or a neocromancer. For all that do these things are an a bomination unto the Lord...” 1 Peter 5:8 charges us to “be vigilant; because your advers ary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour.” Ephesia ns 5:11 says that we are to “have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of da rkness, but rather reprove them.” And 2 Corinthians 6:11, says: “Be not unequally yoked t ogether with unbelievers: for what fellowship has righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion has light with darkness?” In 1980, Skip Tarrant, a head witch in the Church o f Wicca, said: “Being a witch makes one feel more alive.” According to the testim ony of former witches and Satanists, the ancient religion of Witchcraft and its ‘white m agic’ is nothing more than a “little white lie.” The deities they worship are actually demons, and the ‘horned hunter of the night’ is actually Satan.

Only a few souls found enough favor with th e spiritual hierarchy of the reincarnated ancient Masters to be chosen to return to earth as an avatar. New Agers claim that Mohammed, Buddha, and Jesus were avatars , and therefore each was a ‘Christ.’ Alice Bailey has said: “The Christ who will return will not be like the Ch rist who (apparently) departed. He will not be a ‘man of sorrows’; He will not be a silent, pensive figure; He will be the enunciator of spiritual statements which wil l not necessitate interpretation (and give rise to misinterpretation) because He wil l be present to indicate the true meaning C He recognizes and loves those who are not Christian but who retain allegiance to their Founders– the Buddha, Mohammed, and others. He cares not what the faith is, if the objective is love of God and of humanity. If men look for the Christ who left his disciples centuries ago the y will fail to recognize the Christ who is in the process of returning.” Bailey said that her “hidden Masters” told her that 1975 was the time to begin open propagation of their plans.

It is nothing more than a revival o f the ancient Babylonian religion, a dressed)up version of witchcraft, a politically)cor rect form of witchcraft, which they hope to introduce to every aspect of society. The spirit guides they refer to are demons. They ar e working to integrate New Age teaching into religion, and in the process, they ar e trying to discredit Christianity. For instance, New Agers have latched onto the ‘lost yea rs’ of Jesus, the period between his boyhood and the beginning of his ministry, which ar e omitted from the Bible. Kevin Ryerson, the demon channeler for actress Shirley Ma claine, says that his spirit guides told him that “the man Jesus studied for 18 years i n India before he returned to Jerusalem. He was studying the teachings of Buddha and became an adept Yogi himself.” Elizabeth Clare Prophet in her book The Lost Years of Jesus , said that she discovered, through documents she found in the Hima layas, that when Jesus was a youth, he joined a caravan to the East, and studied under “wise men” who taught him"},{"pageNumber":714,"pageContent":"mysticism. Edgar Cayce’s demon guides also gave him similar revelations. He claimed that Jesus traveled through Egypt, India and Persia ; and it was in Persia that he learned from the Mystery Religion teachers.

A book c alled Jesus Lived in India by Holger Kerston, has gone as far as to say that after the “ resurrection” of Jesus, he returned to India, and that his tomb in Kashmir can still be se en today.   Elizabeth Clare Prophet  Edgar Cayce Ruth Montgomery was told by her spirit guides: “...

(he is) the great Initiator ... Lucifer works within each of us to bring us to whol eness, as we move into a new age ... each of us in some way is brought to that point whi ch I term the Luciferic Initiation, the particular doorway through which the individual mus t pass if he is to come ‘fully’ into the presence of his light and his wholeness ... It is o ne that many people now, and in the days ahead, will be facing, for it is an initiation into the new age.” He also made a connection to one world government when he wrote: “ No one will enter the New World Order unless he or she will make a pledge to worshi p Lucifer. No one will enter the New Age unless he will take a Luciferian initiation.” N ew Agers refer to the writings of a 14th century gnostic group, called Luciferians, who wors hiped him, believing him to be the brother of God, and taught that he was wrongly cast out of Heaven, and would someday be vindicated. He was praised as the “bright and mo rning star.”   Dav id Spangler  Benjamin Crème Lola Davis, author of Toward a World Religion for the New Age , identified the New Age ‘Christ’ as Lord Maitreya, who has been labeled as an avatar and a world teacher. She said “he will bring new revelations and further guidance for establishing the World Religion.” She also said that the “World Council of Churches ... has the potential to serve as a source of unity among the diversity of r eligions.” On April 25, 1982, the Tara Center (headquartered in London and N. Hollywood, C A), a New Age group led by Benjamin Crème, ran a full page ad in twenty major papers around the world proclaiming that the New Age Messiah, Lord Maitreya , was alive and ready to institute their plan, which included “the installation of a n ew world government and a new world religion under Maitreya.” The ad said: “Since July, 1977, the Christ has been emerging as a spokesman for a group or community in a well)k nown modern country.” It promised that the ‘Christ’ would appear “within the next two months” and that “his message will be heard inwardly, telepathically, by all people in th eir own language. From that time, with his help, we will build a new world.” A similar ad ran five years later, on January 12, 1 987, in USA Today , under the headline “The Christ is in the World,” describing L ord Maitreya as “a great world teacher"},{"pageNumber":716,"pageContent":"for people of every religion and no religion.” He n ever did appear, and according to Creme, Maitreya, was living in a Hindu)Pakistani co mmunity in southeast London, and attending Oxford University, where he is studying t he sacred writings of the world’s major religions. When Creme spoke in Detroit on November 4, 1981, he was asked if he had met Maitreya, and he said: “No, I’ve never met the Chri st, but I’ve met the human body he is inhabiting several times– but never as the Christ.” According to the Huntington House book New Age Messiah Identified by Troy Lawrence, this man was identified as Rahmat Ahmad, and is the great)great grandson of Mirza Ghu lam Ahmad, who was born in the 1800’s in India, and claimed that he was the Messia h, sent to unite the entire world in a New World Religion. It was revealed that he was bor n in February, 1962 in Rabwah, Pakistan, then went to England in July, 1977, in pr eparation for his role. Lord Maitreya never did appear, and as it turns out, in 1991, Law rence (real name, Darrick Evenson) was exposed as a fraud, and now his exposé has been pretty much ignored. Just as the birth of Jesus was prophesied by many O ld Testament prophets, New Agers believed that the birth of the new ‘Christ,’ was prophesied by Jeane Dixon. Shortly before sunrise on February 5, 1962, Dixon h ad an unusual experience. For several months, astrologers had predicted that an e arth)shaking event on that day, because of a rare conjunction of Jupiter, Saturn an d Venus in the constellation of Pisces. A similar conjunction which occurred nearly 2,000 years ago is believed by some to explain the “bright star in the east” at th e time of the birth of Jesus. Jeane Dixon As she looked outside, she didn’t see any trees, or the street, just a blue sky, above a barren desert. In the sky, the sun was shining br ighter than she had ever seen. Coming from the sun in every direction were brillia nt rays which seemed to be drawing the earth toward it like a magnet. Stepping out of the brightness of the sun’s rays, hand) in)hand was a Pharaoh (later identified as Pharaoh Amenhotep) and Queen Nefertiti. In her arms was a baby in ragged soiled clothing. The eyes of the child were “all)knowing” (the all)seeing eye on the I Iluminati seal?), full of wisdom and knowledge. To one side of the Queen, Dixon could see a pyramid (the I Iluminati?). The couple came before her, as if to offer the baby to the world. Within the sun, Joseph was guiding the tableau like a puppeteer pul ling strings (Bible teacher David Ebaugh has linked Genesis 41:14)36 , dealing with Joseph’s interpretations of the"},{"pageNumber":717,"pageContent":"Pharaoh’s dreams, with the Book of Revelation; in a ddition, Joseph was known as the “dreamer”). Rays of light burst forth from the baby , blending with those of the sun, obliterating the Pharaoh from her sight. Off to the left, Dixon saw Queen Nefertiti walking away, thousands of miles into the past. She paused beside a large brown water jug, and as she stooped to cup her hands and drink, she was stabbed in the back by a dagger. She died and vanished. The baby, meanwhile, had grown to manhood, and a small cross formed above him, expanding until it dr ipped over the earth in every direction. At the same time, people of every race, religion, and color, all knelt and lifted their arms in worship; and were all as one. Dixon interpreted this to mean that there was a chi ld born somewhere in the Middle East, shortly after February 5, 1962, of humble pea sant origin, possibly a direct descendent of Queen Nefertiti. Her husband, Pharaoh Amenhotep IV (known as the great “Heretic King”) had changed his name to Ikhna ton (which means, “He in whom Aton is satisfied”), and built a city, Tell)el)Amar na, protected by impregnable cliffs, to worship the sun god Aton (in 1375 BC). They had sev en daughters, but no sons. After his death, the priests of Amon took over. Tutankhat on, who married the third daughter, became Pharaoh at the age of twelve, and changed hi s name to Tutankhamon (the “image of Amon”), destroying all traces of Atonism, and returning to the worship of earlier gods. If the child isn’t a direct descenden t, the sun could be a symbol of the one world religion that is to come. When the I Iluminati was established, their secret code utilized the planetary symbol for the sun to signif y the Order. Dixon said: “There is no doubt in my mind that the ‘child’ is the actual per son of the Antichrist, the one who will deceive the world in Satan’s name.” Robert Mueller, a New Ager, is a former Assistant S ecretary)General of the UN, and a member of the board of Planetary Citizens. He sug gested that religions should “create common world religious institutions,” and “display the UN flag in all houses of worship.” He has even called for a universal Bible to be writ ten. He said: “We must move as quickly as possible to a one)world government; a on e)world religion; under a one)world leader.” He also said: “My great personal dream is to get a tremendous alliance between all major religions and the UN.” He said in 1982: “The human person and planetary citizenship must be given absolute priori ty over national citizenship.” Some of Mueller’s views were molded by the third UN Secretary)General U Thant, a Buddhist and a one)worlder. In Thant’s book The New Genesis , he calls for the New Age to be ushered in by the year 2000.

In the book Spiritual Politics: Changing the World From the Inside , New Agers Corinne McLaughlin and Gordon Davidson referred to it as a “place of quiet stilln ess and has been referred to as one of the holiest of holies on the planetC” The Meditation Room is shaped like a pyramid withou t a capstone, sometimes described as a trapezoid, which Satanists believe i s the shape that is the most conducive for the manifestation of demonic manifest ation. The room is illuminated only from a single beam of light from the ceiling upon a black stone altar. Hammarskjold said that the altar was “dedicated to the God whom man w orships under many names and in many forms.” On one of the walls is a mural which c ontains occult symbolism, and at it center is the ‘all)seeing eye’ of the I Iluminati. David Meyer, a former witch, said about the room: “I stood in the meditation room, which contains Sat an’s altar C The black stone block has a certain kind of magnetism about it, and when I walked into the room with my praying wife, I could sense the intense pre sence of an evil force beyond description. This is where the world leaders and I Iluminati masterminds go to meditate, which is why it is open to the public onl y in the mornings. Once the sun moves from ante meridian to post meridian only the adept in witchcraft are allowed into that room, for that is witchcraft doct rine regarding meditation.

THE WORLD CHURCH Just as there have been signs that the political po wers of this world are coming together in a New World Order, so it has been with the Church. The establishment of a World Church would seem to go hand)in)hand with a W orld Government. We will go back to the early history of man, and follow the hi story of the church, and what its relationship may be to the World Church. Tower of Babel In the Bible, according to the book of Genesis, Noa h had three sons, Ham, Shem,"},{"pageNumber":722,"pageContent":"and Japheth. Ham had a son by the name of Cush, and Cush’s son was called Nimrod, and was known as the “mighty hunter.” It was Nimrod who attempted to build a tower that would reach to Heaven. God confused their lang uage, so they couldn’t understand each other, and they were scattered over the face o f the Earth. Nimrod (purported to be the founder of Masonry) established a religious sys tem, with the help of his mother and father, to control the people through political met hods. This was the beginning of the occult, which became known as Baal (Satan) worship. A common practice was to sacrifice babies.    Nimrod  Baal Nimrod’s great)uncle Shem became so enraged over Ni mrod’s activities, and with the help of a group of Egyptians, killed him, chopp ed his body up into little pieces, and sent the pieces to different cities as a warning to those who dabbled in the occult. Nimrod’s mother, Semiramis (who had married her son Nimrod), took over the religion, and proclaimed Nimrod a god. She gathered all of Nimrod’s pieces, except for his penis, which she couldn’t find. She created the symbol of the obelisk and established phallus worship. She claimed that an Ev ergreen tree sprouted from a tree stump, which she said indicated the entry of new li fe into the deceased Nimrod. Every year on the anniversary of Nimrod’s birth, said to be on December 25th, she would leave gifts at this Evergreen tree, which was the o rigin of the Christmas tree. The religion was pushed underground. Those joining had to take oaths of secrecy, and had to tell their priests everything they did w rong. In this way, via the ‘confessional,’ they could blackmail anyone who didn’t yield to the ir will. Semiramis became known as the ‘Queen of Heaven’ and was symbolized by the fig ure of the Moon. Nimrod, her son/husband, was now called Baal, the Sun God, or t he ‘Divine Son of Heaven.’ Statues were produced showing Semiramis holding the baby Ni mrod. When Babylon fell, the religion grew in Egypt and P ergamos (in Asia Minor), where Semiramis became known as Isis, and Nimrod became k nown as Horus (or Osiris) the Sun God. In Deuteronomy 4:19, Moses warned against Sun worship. In other lands, forms of Baal worship became dominant among various religious practices. In China, Semiramis was called ‘Sing Moo’ (‘Holy Mother’); in ancient Phoenecia, she was called ‘Ashtoreth,’ and in Asia Minor, ‘Diana.’"},{"pageNumber":723,"pageContent":" Osiris So, God established a nation of Jews, called Israel , and gave them laws to live by. They were to be the light to a world ravaged with s in, but they too became caught up in idol worship. Even though prophets, anointed by God , warned them, they did not heed the warning. As a punishment, God allowed them to b ecome enslaved by other nations. When Attalus, King of Pergamos, died in 133 B.C., h e bequeathed the Babylonian priesthood to Rome. Thus, Julius Caesar became the Supreme Pontiff of the Babylonian Order. All Roman emperors served in this capacity until 376 A.D., when Emperor Gratian refused it, and Damascus, a Church Bishop, was appointed the Supreme Pontiff. Jesus Christ, whose birth was prophesied by Isaiah (Isa. 7:14), was sent by God to be the Saviour of the Jews. However, He wasn’t reco gnized as the awaited Messiah, and was despised by religious leaders who plotted a gainst Him. These Jewish leaders became His judges, presenting phony witnesses, and breaking eighteen Jewish laws in order to have Him sentenced to death. Satan, who th ree years before, had tempted Jesus in the wilderness, believed that through His crucifixion, he had defeated Christ. But, as you know, He rose from the dead three days later; and forty days later was transfigured into heaven. With the Great Commission , Jesus had instructed His disciples to go to all the world to spread the gosp el, and Satan tried his best to defeat the Christian movement. "},{"pageNumber":724,"pageContent":" Jesus the Christ Two years after the establishment of the true Chris tian Church, Satan raised up a man known as Simon Magus, a Babylonian priest, to d o his bidding. According to Acts 8:9)11, Simon “used sorcery, and bewitched the peop le ... giving out that himself was some great one.” Many people, “from the least to th e greatest” were impressed with him, thinking him to be “the great power of God.” W hen the apostle Philip began to preach the gospel, and perform miracles in Samaria, Satan saw the potential of being able to use Christianity for his own purpose, and S imon tried to buy his way into an apostleship, without the repenting his sins, in ord er to gain this mysterious new power. Simon adopted some of the Christian teachings inter weaving it with his own pagan religion, and called it Christianity. The Dictionary of Christian Biography (Vol. 4, page 682) says: “...when Justin Martyr wrote his ‘Apology’ (152 A.D.), the sect of the Sim onians appears to have been formidable, for he speaks four times of their found er, Simon ... and tells that he came to Rome in the days of Claudius Caesar (45 A.D.), and made such an impression by his magical powers, that he was honored as a god, a sta tue being erected to him on the Tiber, between the two bridges, bearing the inscrip tion ‘Simoni deo Sancto’ (‘the holy god Simon’).” Besides his attempt to dilute Christian teaching, S atan zeroed in on its leaders. Stephen, who was a deacon in the first Christian ch urch in Jerusalem, was stoned to death in 29 A.D.; James, the son of Zebedee, was be headed in Jerusalem in 45 A.D.; Philip was tied to a pillar at Phrygia in 54 A.D. a nd stoned; James, the son of Alpheus, was dragged from the Temple, stoned, and beaten to death with a club in 63 A.D.; in 64 A.D., Mark (author of one of the Gospels) was seize d by a mob of pagan priests and idol worshipers, who tied a rope around his neck, a nd dragged him through the streets of Alexandria till he died; Paul (Saul of Tarsus) w as persecuted, then beheaded in Rome, in 69 A.D.; Simon Peter was crucified upside) down in Rome in 69 A.D.; Andrew was tied to a cross, and left there three days befo re he died; Bartholomew was severely beaten in Armenia in 70 A.D., then beheaded; at Cal aminia in 70 A.D., Thomas was thrown into a furnace, then speared to death with j avelins; at Nad)davar in 70 A.D.,"},{"pageNumber":725,"pageContent":"Matthew was nailed to the ground, then beheaded; Si mon, the Canaanite, was crucified in Syria in 70 A.D.; Judas Thaddeus was beaten to d eath with sticks in 70 A.D.; Matthias (who replaced Judas Iscariot as a disciple /apostle after Judas committed suicide) was tied to a cross, stoned, and then behe aded in 70 A.D.; Luke (another writer of the Gospels) was hung from an olive tree in Gree ce in 93 A.D.; and Timothy was stoned to death by idol worshipers in 98 A.D. Being that Rome, who ruled the known world, was und er the influence of a form of Baal worship, Christians who refused to worship the Emperor were persecuted, beginning with Nero, in the middle of the first cen tury. They were arrested and put to death in various ways, such as crucifixion, being t ied inside animal skins and attacked by wild dogs, fed to lions, and tied to stakes to b e burned as human torches to light Nero’s gardens at night. These persecutions, which lasted until early in the fourth century, caused the Christians to literally go unde rground, to worship secretly. They took refuge in the subterranean catacombs of Rome, which extended for miles underneath the city. There are said to be over two million Christian graves in these caverns. This persecution of the Christians was Sat an’s attempt to get rid of the Biblical teaching. Various religions, cults, and sects, were established to alter the Holy Scriptures in order to change them, and confuse the world. Although the Christians were persecuted, their fait h in God stood fast. John, the brother of James, the last of the disciples, was ex iled to a penal colony on the island of Patmos in 97 A.D. He was instrumental in preserving our Holy Bible, by informing Christians which of the manuscripts were genuine. T hese manuscripts were then hidden by Christians in the cellars of the great monasteri es. The Roman Catholic Church In 305, the two Roman emperors, Diocletian and Maxi mian, stepped down, and were succeeded by their deputies, Galerius and Constanti us. Constantius was then replaced by Maximinus Daia in the east, and Severus in the w est, and he sent for his son Constantine to help him reclaim the throne. After C onstantius died, Constantine was proclaimed emperor by his father’s army, and he led them in a march against Rome. On the evening of October 27, 312, he came face to face with the legions of Maxentius at the Milvian Bridge on the Tiber River. As he prepared to pit his small army against the military might of Rome, so the legend g oes, he vowed that if God would help him conquer Rome, he would institute Christian rule . Eusebius wrote in The Life of Constantine , that above the setting sun, Constantine and his t roops saw a cross in the sky, and above it were the words: “Hoc signo victor eris,” which means: “In this sign you shall be victorious.” That night, Christ appeared t o him with the cross, and told him to use it as a guardian.

Lactantius, a Christian, a few years later, wrote t hat Constantine had a vision of Apollo at the temple in Gaul, who instructed him to place the “celestial sign of God” on their shields prior to going into battle. Labarum Constantine felt that Christ was a manifestation of the Sun God, Sol, or Apollo, even though Christians didn’t know it.

The next year, in 313, he issued the Edict of Milan (also known as the Edict of Toleration), which bestowed religious freedom, in o rder to show tolerance towards Christianity, and all other forms of monotheism wer e forbidden. He had his troops sprinkled in baptism, proclaiming them to be Christ ians, although spiritually they weren’t. Constantine made Christianity the official religion of Rome. A document discovered in the eighth century, called the ‘Donat ion of Constantine’ was said to have conferred some of his secular power upon the Pope, and it was used by the Church to gain some authority in the government, but it was l ater proved to be a forgery. In 325, he set up the Council of Nicaea, and ruled it as the ‘Summus Pontifex’ (which is the official title of the Pope). He considered h imself to be the head of the Church, although the Bishop of Rome was the recognized head , later to be known as the Pope (Italian for ‘father’). Constantine ordered all wri tings that challenged Church teaching to be gathered up and destroyed, and in 331 he commiss ioned a new Bible. In 303, pagan emperor Diocletian had already destroyed most of th e Christian writings around Rome, so of all the manuscripts of the New Testament avai lable, not one had been produced before the fourth century, which made it easy for t he Church to alter the Scriptures to fit the point of view they wanted to convey. Although all Romans were baptized into the Christia n faith, there were those who wanted to remain loyal to the Babylonian mysteries, and sought to retain some aspects of their religion in the new Christian religion. Th us, paganism was allowed to infiltrate the Church. Although Constantine claimed to have co nverted to Christianity, he secretly worshipped the Sun God. He made Sunday a day of res t, not because it was supposed to be the Lord’s day, but being that it was the fir st day of the week, it was to be a tribute to the Sun God. St. Peter was said to be the first Bishop (or Pope) of the Church, and each Pope is said to be his successor. The rationale being that Jesus said to Peter (originally known as Simeon, or Simon, Jesus called him Cephas, or ‘r ock,’ and the name Peter comes from the Latin ‘petrus,’ which means ‘rock’): “That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church...” This is a tradition that i s historically inaccurate, because Peter never professed that distinction. There is no evide nce that the Apostle Peter had ever been in Rome, at any time. In that verse, in the or iginal Greek, ‘Peter’ is translated from ‘petros’ (Strong’s #4074, a small rock) and ‘rock’ is translated from ‘petra’ (Strong’s # 4073, a mass of rock). What this means is that Jesu s is the rock, the foundation of the Church, while Peter was just going to help build it . However, secular history explains that there was a “Simon Peter” in Rome during the first century. The pagan gods of the Babylonians an d Greeks were identified by the name Peter (or Patres). The Romans referred to Nept une, Saturn, Mars, and Liber, as ‘gods’ of the Peter)rank. Going back as far as Nimr od, Deuteronomy 23:4 says that Balaam of Pethor was a sacred high place where ther e was an oracle temple. ‘Pethor’ meant “place of interpretation,” and ‘Balaam’ was t he chief Pantora (Peter) and successor to Nimrod. The Hebrew Lexicon indicates t hat the consonantal word P)T)R or Peter means “to interpret.” Thus, Simon Magus, who had become the interpreter of the Babylonian Mysteries, became known as Simon Peter. The Vaticano Illustrato II says that the Babylonian statue of Jupiter was renamed ‘ Peter.’ Eusebius (264)340), the Bishop of Caesarea, a Churc h historian (who was"},{"pageNumber":728,"pageContent":"imprisoned by the Romans as they searched for Bible s to destroy them), was Constantine’s chief religious advisor. He studied a t Origen’s (184)254) school of Religion and Philosophy in Alexandria, where many g nostic scholars lived and studied. The school became a center for ‘Christian’ learning and culture. Eusebius and his scribes were instructed by Constantine to prepare f ifty Bibles for the churches in Constantinople (Byzantium, or the ‘new Rome’). Eusebius wasn’t a true Christian, because he believ ed Jesus to be a lesser god, and was guided by that fact when he produced his versio n of the Scriptures. For instance, he eliminated the verse in 1 John 5:7, which says: “For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost : and these three are one.” These altered manuscripts were prepared into Bibles for t he newly formed Roman Catholic Church, and it was out of Eusebius’ translation, th at the Latin Vulgate Bible emerged (a revision of the old Latin version translated from t he Greek Septuagint), written by Jerome (382)404), which became the official Bible for all Roman Catho lics. All other versions were banned, discarded, and destroyed. Emperor Theodosius (378)398) made Christianity the official State religion, and church membership was mandatory. This forced conver sion brought many heathens, idol worshipers, and pagans into the Church. Soon t hese pagans succeeded in getting statues of Semiramis and Nimrod into the Church, as the Babylonian system of ‘mother and child’ worship eventually evolved into the Mado nna and child symbol (prominent at Christmas), and referred to them as the Virgin Mary and the baby Jesus. The halos around their heads were symbolic of the sun. Confes sionals were established, just as they were in Babylon, and soon the Church began to grow in power. Theodosius Several Christian sects and semi)Christian orders c riticized the Catholic Church, and taught from the original manuscripts, which they gu arded with their lives, in order to insure the survival of God’s word. The Waldenses were founded in 1170 by a rich mercha nt from Lyons, in southern France, called Peter Waldo. He separated from the C atholic Church, and sold all of his possessions.

The Christian mo vement spread to Spain, northern France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Hungary, and Switze rland. The Anabaptists and Lollards were two groups which sprang from the Wald enses. The Anabaptists was the name for various groups fro m the radical branch of the Protestant Reformation in the 16th century. They we re active in Germany, Holland, and Switzerland, and were nicknamed the ‘rebaptizers’ b ecause they rejected the idea of infant baptism, which was practiced by the Roman Ca tholic Church, as a means of saving souls, and demanded rebaptism. Severely pers ecuted, they eventually rallied behind Menno Simons (1496)1561) who started the gro up which eventually became known as the Mennonites. John Wycliffe, a professor of Divinity at Oxford Un iversity, linked the Pope with the Antichrist. He translated the Bible from Latin to E nglish, and produced the first English Bible in 1382, paving the way for the Reformation. He organized a group called the Order of Poor Preachers, and began distributing his new Bible. They were called ‘Lollards’ (or ‘idle babblers’). Eventually Wycliff e’s writings were banned, and the Pope ordered him to Rome to undergo trial. He died of a stroke in 1384 before he was able to go. By 1425, the Catholic Church was so upset with the increase in the number of Lollards, that they ordered Wycliffe’s bones to be exhumed, and they were burned together with the 200 books he had written.

As one speaker said: “An accursed heresy has recently arisen in th e neighborhood of Toulouse, and it is the duty of the bishops to put it down with all the rigor of the ecclesiastical law.” Anyone who didn’t profess Catholicism was sought out, and again, Satan attempted to destroy Christianity. In 1198, Pope Innocent III sent two Inquisitors to France with the following order: “The foxes called Waldenses, Cathari, and Patari, w ho, though they have different faces, yet all hang together by their tails, are se nt by Satan to devastate the vineyard of the Lord,” and they were “to be judged and killed.” In 1200, the Pope instructed a Spanish priest named Dominique de Guzman (1170)1221 ) to form an Order to vanquish"},{"pageNumber":730,"pageContent":"all opposing religious groups.

A missionary, Peter of Castelna u, was sent to preach against the Albigensians, who killed him, and in 1208, in respo nse to the murder, the Pope instigated a holy war against the Albigensians, and the Cathari of Toulouse, killing many. Innocent III At the Fourth Council of the Lateran in 1227, Pope Honorius III sanctioned the Inquisition, and said that all heretics should be t urned over to the government, and their property confiscated. Catholics sympathetic to the views of these groups were excommunicated. The Inquisition sought to eliminate anyone who wasn’t Catholic and refused to submit to the Pope. Christians were labe led as enemies of the State. Torture was used to obtain confessions and information, whi ch was authorized by Pope Innocent IV in 1252. Christians were tortured by ho isting them in the air to dislocate their shoulders, tearing their arms out of the sock ets. Other methods of torture included lacerating their backs with spikes, suffocation, po uring oil on them and setting them on fire. Female prisoners were often raped and beaten. Most, however, were killed by being burned at the stake. The Roman Catholic Church had become so powerful, t hat through their control of the royalty in Europe, the Church and State had com bined in an effort to make Catholicism the universal religion. In Spain, within an eighteen year period, the Chief Inquisitor, Torquemada (1420) 1498), imprisoned 97,000, and burned 10,200 to deat h. From Spain, the Inquisition spread to northern Italy, southern France, Germany, the Netherlands, Mexico, Latin America, Austria, and Poland.

To celebrate, the Pope ordered the Rosary said in every church to thank the Virgin Mary for victory, and had a medal struck to commemorate the occasion. In England, Jesuit priests translated Origen’s Alex andrian manuscripts into English in 1582, but the new Bible was rejected. Some resea rchers feel that this was the real reason behind the attack of the Spanish Armada in 1 588. Spain’s mighty fleet was defeated.

Well, by now, you should understand how they work, so what b etter person to use, then somebody who is admired and respected by millions, even though his impact for their cause is subtle and rather indirect. Throughout his life, Graham has established relationships with people and made alliances with o rganizations that seem to counteract the message of salvation that he has brought to the world. For instance, he considered his relationship with Henry Luce as an “enduring fr iendship.” Luce, the publisher of magazines like People , Life , Time , Fortune , and Money , was a Yale graduate, a member of the Skull and Bones and the Council on Fo reign Relations.

Through the Federa l Council of Churches, Dulles was chairman for their Commission on a Just and Dur able Peace who issued a report calling for a “world government.” In 1957, the Protestant Council of New York, affili ated with the NCC, invited Graham to speak at Madison Square Garden in New York.

In addition to his adulterous behavior, he denied the virgin birth and resurrection of Christ. In a 1961 interview for Ebony magazine he said: “I do not believe in hell as a pl ace of a literal burning fire.” In fact, Graham’s views in that regard also underwe nt a metamorphosis. In the July, 1978, issue of McCall’s magazine he said: “I used to think that pagans in far)off countries were lost– were going to hell– if they di d not have the Gospel of Jesus Christ preached to them. I no longer believe that C I beli eve there are other ways of recognizing the existence of God– through nature, f or instance– and plenty of other opportunities, therefore, of saying yes to God.” He elaborated in the book A Prophet With Honor by saying that he “did not automatically consign t o hell all who never heard the Christian gospel preached.” In an interview in the April 10, 1983 Orlando Sentinel , Graham said in response to why many Americans didn’t accept the concept of hel l: “I think that hell essentially is separation from God forever. And that is the worst hell that I can think of. But I think people have a hard time believing God is going to a llow people to burn in a literal fire forever.” In a July, 1983 book written by Graham fo r distribution at his International Conference for Itinerant Evangelists in Amsterdam, he said: “Hell is not the most popular of preaching topics.

Apparently Billy’s ‘bar’ was not raised too high, because he saw our country’s leaders (as well as other political leade rs) as Christians, yet their fruit did not bear that out. Even though he was a Democrat, in 19 60, he wrote an article for Life magazine to endorse Richard Nixon’s presidential ca ndidacy, who was his “closest friend in the political world.” Henry Luce refused to publish it because of pressure from the Kennedy camp.

Mao Tse)tung’s (China’s communist leader) e ight precepts are basically the same as the Ten Commandments. In fact, if we ca n’t have the Ten Commandments read in our schools, I’ll settle for M ao’s precepts.” In 1977, on a trip to Hungary, a Communist country, a deceived Graham talked about the “religious freedom” there. In May, 1982, Graham was invited to speak at the World Conference of Religious Workers for Saving th e Sacred Gift of Life from Nuclear Catastrophe (which was attended by 600 clergymen fr om around the world), which was sponsored by the Russian Orthodox Church. The Reaga n Administration tried to convince him not to go fearing that he would become a victim of communist propaganda. While he was there, he said that he did n’t see any evidence of religious repression, and said: “There are differences, of co urse, in religion as it is practiced here and, let’s say, in the U.S. But that doesn’t mean t here is no religious freedom.” That was hardly an accurate statement concerning the religio us status of the Soviet Union, an atheistic country, who at the time was still domina ted by Communism, and persecuted those who worshipped God. When he returned to America, Graham was asked if hi s views towards communism had changed, and he said: “I’ve changed a little at this point, but I am not a pro) Communist.” In Franklin Graham’s book Rebel With a Cause , he said that on one particular trip to Russia, Soviet government offici als completely controlled his schedule, “but never hindered his preaching C (because) Daddy never spoke against Communism in his sermons.” Franklin Graham"},{"pageNumber":757,"pageContent":" In 1957, Graham was quoted as saying that Catholic ism was “a stench in the nostrils of God,” yet leaders in his own organizati on, the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, have tried to assure supporters that B illy is not catering to the Catholic Church.

I have never known a religious crusade that was more effec tive than Dr. Graham’s. I have never heard the slightest criticism of anything he has ever said from a Catholic source.” In response, Graham said: “I feel much closer to Ro man Catholic tradition than to some of the more liberal ProtestantsC” In 1966, he said: “I find myself closer to Catholics than the radical Protestants.” In 1978, Billy said: “I f ound that my beliefs are essentially the same as those of orthodox Catholics.” Richard Cushing When Billy was in Poland in 1978, he praised the “g reatness” of Pope Paul VI, even though leaders of his own church criticized him for catering to Communists.

As a matter of fact, his subject in Boston was really an evangelical address in which he asked the people to come to Christ, to give thei r lives to Christ. I said, ‘Thank God I’ve got somebody to quote now with some real a uthority’.” Graham has called Pope John a “great evangelist,” t he “greatest religious leader of the modern world and one of the greatest moral and spiritual leaders of this century.” Another time, he said that the Pope was “God’s inst rument for revival in our generation.” In 1994 when Time magazine declared Pope John as its “Man of the Year ,” Graham said: “He’ll go down in history as the greatest of our modern popes C He’s been the strong conscience of the whole Christian world.” In an interview with Associated Press reporter Richard Ostling, he said he would choose P ope John as the ‘Man of the Century,’ because he admired “his courage, determin ation, intellectual abilities and his understanding of Catholic, Protestant and Orthodox differences, and the attempt at some form of reconciliation.” He even wrote the For eward to the book Pope John Paul II: A Tribute . The Pittsburgh Sun-Telegraph quoted an insider as saying: “Many of the people w ho reached a decision for Christ at our meetings (1952 Pittsburgh Crusade) have joined the Catholic Church C This happened both in Boston and Washington. After all, one of our prime purposes is to help the churches in the commu nityC” As early as 1956, Graham said that he was going to “send them to their own c hurches– Roman Catholic, Protestant or Jewish C The rest will be up to God.” He has said: “My goal, I always made clear, was not to preach against Catholic beli efs or to proselytize people who were already committed to Christ within the Catholi c Church.” When a Crusade is planned, a Committee is brought t ogether, made up of leaders from local churches.

You want to reconfirm the decision th at you made when you joined the church.” Nothing was ever said about the sacrificia l death of Jesus on the Cross, or about the repenting of their sins. He even reassure d them that his purpose was not to get them to leave the Church to join another denomi nation. In 1979, nearly 3,500 decision cards were given to the Catholic Church. The Florida Catholic indicated that in 1983, the decision cards for 600 people from the Orlando crusade were given to the Catholic Church. About 50 0 names from his 1987 Denver Crusade were given to the St. Thomas Moore Roman Ca tholic Church.

In one of his ‘My Answer’ columns, in response to a Roman Catholic who was writing in regard to some of the changes going on i n the Catholic Church, Graham responded by telling him not to “pull out of the ch urch! Stay in it, stay close to the Lord, and use these experiences as an opportunity to help your church be what God intendsC” Likewise, the counselors at his Crusades are warned not to criticize the church or religious affiliation of any of the peopl e who come forward for Salvation. Despite all of the evidence to the contrary, Graham ’s people have denied any sort of theological wrongdoing. In 1964, an assistant to Gr aham, George Edstrom, wrote: “Mr. Graham has never preached in a Catholic Church, and he does not agree with them in the joining of one church. If you heard this, it is nothing but false rumors.” However, in 1963, he did speak at the Roman Catholic Belmont Ab bey in North Carolina. Robert Ferm, a member of his team, on many occasions, has informed the faithful that Graham would “never compromise the gospel by consorting wi th Catholics,” yet Ferm was the one who spoke to the students and faculty before th e Crusade at Notre Dame (1977). In the early 1990’s, a retired missionary wrote the BG EA to find out why he was sending new converts to the Catholic Church. The response f rom T.W.

Graham had said that one of his best friends is Jes sie Bader, who was the Secretary of Evangelism for the National Council of Churches. In a speech to the NCC he said: “My wife is a Presbyterian. Her denomination is in the National Council so perhaps I am here by marriage.” In another speech on August 27, 1991 he said: “There’s no group of people in the world that I wou ld rather be with right now than you all.

We’re separated by theology and, in some ins tances, culture and race, but all of that means nothing to me any more.” Even though he is a Baptist, President Bush invited him to lead various prayers at the 1989 ina uguration. Graham wrote: “I protested at first, pointing out that it was customary to hav e clergy from other traditions participate also (often a Jewish rabbi, a Catholic priest, and perhaps an Orthodox leader). He remained adamant, however, saying he felt more comf ortable with me; besides, he added, he didn’t want people to think he was just t rying to play politics by having representatives of different faiths.” In 1992 The Oregonian quoted Graham in a Portland, Oregon press conference as calling for “o ne merged church.” As you can see, the Rev.

He was a very thoughtful, if lonely, man who was trying to make a difference for world peace, in large part because o f his Christian convictions.” If you remember, it was Dag, the Swedish Socialist (who openly advocated communist policies), who designed the Satanic Medit ation Room in the UN building. Dag was also a speaker at the 1954 World Council of Churches meeting. In 1990, Graham received the World Citizen Award fr om the World Affairs Council (which is associated with the Council on Foreign Re lations) for “promoting and fostering international understanding and world peace.” When President George H.

In the ensuing sermon, h e said: “Perhaps, out of this war will come a new peace and– as been stated by the Pr esident– a New World Order.” Rev.

On October 11, 1962, Pope John held the first Ecume nical Council at St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome to modernize the Church. Over 2,70 0 gathered, including the entire Roman Catholic hierarchy, 28 non)Catholic prelates, representatives from most major Protestant denominations, and dignitaries from East ern Orthodox Churches in the Middle East. A few months after the initial meeting , the Council reconvened with 2,500 ecclesiastical dignitaries, and 50 observers from n on)Catholic denominations. After Pope John died, Billy Graham said at a press confer ence in Bonn, Germany: “Pope John brought an entirely new era to the world.

He wrote: “The restoration of unity among all Christians is o ne of the principal concerns of the Second Vatican Council.

He wrote a Papal Encyclical that “calle d on the nations to abandon sovereignty to form a world government.” From October 24 to 28, 1999, Pope John Paul II (197 8) ) held an interfaith meeting at the Vatican that included Jews, Hindus, Muslims, Buddhists, Shintoists, as well as representatives from Orthodox, Anglican, Lutheran, and evangelical churches.

John Paul II On September 5, 2000, the Catholic Church issued a document called Dominus Iesus which declared “the Roman Catholic Church to be th e only ‘instrument for the salvation of all humanity’.” Pope John Paul II said that “Rome must always be the center of all Christianity and the pope must be the head.” For two years, a group of eight Protestants, led by Charles Colson, the former Nixon aide (echoing sentiments expressed in his book The Body ), and seven Roman Catholics, led by Father Richard John Neuhaus (form er Lutheran, who denies the virgin birth of Christ, his miracles, and his resurrection ), worked on an 25)page, 8000)word document known as “Evangelicals and Catholics Toget her: The Christian Mission in the Third Millennium.” (or ECT) It calls for Protestant s and Catholics to discontinue their opposition in order to unite against enemies which are common to both of their religious philosophies. In the November, 1994, issue of Christianity Today (the magazine started by Billy Graham), an editorial by Colson was titled “Why Catholics Are Our Allies.” This seems to be part of a campaign to bring the two rel igions closer together in ideology.

One night, I caught Jack van Impe on his show, sayi ng that he agreed with the Pope on almost every issue. Now here is a man who has do ne a tremendous amount of prophetic research, and yet by condoning the Cathol ic Church, he is contributing to the ecumenical movement. Paul Crouch of the Trinity Bro adcasting Network has said: “I’m eradicating the word Protestant even out of my voca bulary ... I (am) not protesting anything ... (it’s) time for Catholics and non)Cath olics to come together as one in the Spirit and one in the Lord.” Robert Schuller (calle d the Norman Vincent Peale of the West Coast), who is known to be accepting of Islam, New Age and other cult groups, and has met with the Pope four times, has said: “It ’s time for Protestants to go to the shepherd (or the Pope) and say, What do we have to do to come home?”   Ja ck van Impe  Robert Sc huller It seems inevitable that sometime in the near futur e, the last remaining obstacles to a merger between the Roman Catholic Church and the World Council of Churches, into a World Church, will take place, and will contribut e to the influence exercised by the New World Order.

And he exerc iseth all the power of the first beast before him, and causeth the earth and t hem which dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was hea led. And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from heav en on the earth in the sight of men, And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth, by the means of those miracles he had power to do in the sight of the bea st; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live. And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both spea k, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed.” (Revelation 13:11)15) The identity of this individual, who has been label ed– the False Prophet, has been the subject of much speculation. However, I think t here are some clues as to who this person may be. Matthew 24:26 says: “Wherefore if th ey shall say unto you, Behold, he is in the desert (Mohammedanism); go not forth: beh old, he is in the secret chambers (the Vatican); believe it not.” The Catholic Eccles iastical Dictionary states: “The Pope is not simply a man, but, as it were, God.” In light o f what has been discussed earlier about the development of a World Church, there seem s to be quite a few things which point to the Pope being the leader of this World Ch urch, and perhaps the one who will be known as the False Prophet. A resolution passed at a Vatican Council, called fo r the placing of the Pope “on the throne of the world.” The Pope is known as the ‘Sup reme Pontiff of the Universal Church,’ as well as a host of other titles mentione d earlier; and in Revelation 17:9, it mentions that the seat of the Antichrist will be in the ‘seven mountains’; and Rome, which was built on seven mountains, is known as the ‘seven)hilled city.’ Rome, the seat of world power in the ancient world, is also the ho me of the Vatican, which is recognized as an independent government apart from the Italian government. The Pope is literally a god to the Catholic Church, having the authority to forgive sins. Dave Hunt, in his exposé, A Woman Rides the Beast , analyzed the title, ‘Vicar of Christ,’ and he fou nd that the word ‘Vicar’ comes from the Latin ‘vicariu s’ which means ‘anti’ (or to be more precise, ‘alternate’ or ‘substitute,’ which is in l ine with what was discussed earlier), which leads to the literal translation of ‘Vicar of Christ, as ‘Antichrist.’ "},{"pageNumber":771,"pageContent":" The 7 hills of Rome: Palatine, Capitoline, Esquilin e, Aventine, Celian, Viminal, Quirinal According to Revelation 17:3)4, the color of the Fa lse Prophet will be “scarlet” (red).

In 1130, A nacletus II was elected as the Pope. His great)grandfather was Baruch, a successful Jewi sh businessman who served as an advisor to Pope Benedict IX. Benedict requested tha t he convert to Catholicism, which Baruch did, changing his name to that of the Pope. The name ‘Benedict’ is Latin for ‘blessed,’ while the name ‘Baruch’ is Hebrew for th e same thing. The conversion was in name only, because Baruch still financed a synagogu e in the Jewish quarter of Rome. Baruch’s son, an aide to Pope Leo IX (1049)55), als o converted, changing his name to Lee. Lee’s son, Petrus Leonis, was the first to use the name Pierleone. His family became an established financial power in the late 1 1th century, and became active in the affairs of the Catholic Church. His son, Pietro , was sent to a monastery where he worked his way up, attaining the position of cardin al. When Pope Honorius II (1124)30) was on his deathbed , preparations were made to elect a new Pope. The Pierleone family offered thei r son, the cardinal; while the Frangipani family, a traditional Catholic family, o ffered its own candidate. The Frangipani hid the Pope, and after he died in 1130, convened a portion of the cardinals to elect their choice, who adopted the name Innocen t II (1130)43). The Pierleone family held an election the same day, with a greater numbe r of cardinals present, and elected Pietro, who took the name Anacletus II (1130)38). R ome sided with Anacletus, and Innocent II fled to France, then later traveled aro und Europe, accusing Anacletus of being an ‘anti)pope.’ Despite efforts to remove him , Anacletus remained Pope till he died in 1138. A year later, Innocent II returned, a nd after Victor IV resigned (also considered to be an anti)pope), was elected, and se rved till his death in 1143. The Vatican now refers to Anacletus II as an ‘anti)pope ’ (“one who uncanonically claims or exercises the office of the Roman Pontiff”), and ha s eliminated him from papal history. Two other Popes were also members of the Jewish Pie rleone family: Gregory VI (1045)46) and Gregory VII (1073)86, known as ‘Hilde brand,’ who was a descendant of a daughter of Lee, and was later made a saint).

If these two things were done, the wrath of God would not fall upon the Earth. It wasn’t done, therefore the count ry of Russia was to become the instrument of God’s punishment upon the nations. In 1957, Cardinal Ottaviani, in referring to the pr ophecy, said it had to be buried “in the most hidden, the deepest, the most obscure and inaccessible place on earth.” In 1978, John Paul II said that his predecessors “pref erred to postpone publication so as not to encourage the world power of Communism to ma ke certain moves.” In 1980, while speaking to a group of German Catholics, John Paul II admitted that the “Third Secret” did indeed refer to impending punishment fr om God and that because Pope John XXIII, for diplomatic reasons, failed to honor the stipulations, the prophecy had been set into motion, and couldn’t be stopped. The following is the “Third Secret” (as given on Ju ly 13, 1917)– “After the two parts which I have already explained , at the left of Our Lady and a little above, we saw an Angel with a flaming sword in his left hand; flashing, it gave out flames that looked as though they would se t the world on fire; but they died out in contact with the splendour that Our Lad y radiated towards him from her right hand: pointing to the earth with his righ t hand, the Angel cried out in a loud voice: ‘Penance, Penance, Penance!’ And we saw in an immense light that is God: ‘something similar to how people appear in a mirror when they pass in front of it’ a Bishop dressed in White ‘we had the impression that it was the Holy Father.’ Other Bishops, Priests, men and women Reli gious going up a steep mountain, at the top of which there was a big Cross of rough)hewn trunks as of a cork)tree with the bark; before reaching there the Holy Father passed through a big city half in ruins and half trembling with halt ing step, afflicted with pain and sorrow, he prayed for the souls of the corpses he m et on his way; having reached the top of the mountain, on his knees at th e foot of the big Cross he was"},{"pageNumber":776,"pageContent":"killed by a group of soldiers who fired bullets and arrows at him, and in the same way there died one after another the other Bishops, Priests, men and women Religious, and various lay people of different rank s and positions.

She saw the throne of the Pope, but it was empty. Off to one side, she saw a Pope, with blood running down his face, dripp ing over his left shoulder. She interpreted this vision to mean, that within this c entury, a Pope will be bodily harmed. She saw hands reaching out for the throne. She said that the new head of the Church would have a different insignia than that of the Po pe. Because of the unearthly light, she knew that the power would still be there, but not i n the person of the Pope.

It was linked, on the telephone, to a parallel ceremony which took place in South Carol ina. The book ends up with the Pope, before dying, leaving a written account about it on his desk for the next Pope (a thinly)veiled description of John Paul II) to find. Malachi Martin and his book Windswept House According to The New American , Martin reiterated that the Satanic rite took plac e: “Oh yes, it is true; very much so, but the only way I could put that down into print is in novelistic form.” He also confirmed it to John Loef fler, host of the Steel on Steel radio show, where he was a frequent guest, and said that the Pope did not even know about it. On January 24, 1979, at the Vatican, the Pope met f or two hours with the Soviet foreign minister, Andrei Gromyko. Afterward, Gromyk o referred to him as “a man with a worldview.” John Paul said that the meeting was to talk about “the prospects for world peace.” "},{"pageNumber":780,"pageContent":" Andrei Gromyko On Sunday, April 3, 1994, the Parade magazine featured a front page picture of Pope John, with the quote: “We trust that, with the approach of the year 2000, Jerusalem will become the city of peace for the ent ire world and that all the people will be able to meet there, in particular the believers in the religions that find their birthright in the faith of Abraham.” Note the global implicati on. The interview inside by Tad Szulc focused on the Vatican’s establishment of diplomati c relations with Israel on December 30, 1993, which came during a time when Israel was also trying to work out their own peace accord in the Middle East. This agreement will allow the Vatican to have a sea t at the negotiations on the final determination of Jerusalem. The Vatican embassy wil l be in Tel Aviv, where most other embassies are located, because Jerusalem is not rec ognized as Israel’s capital. In March, 1994, the Vatican also established relations with the Moslem country of Jordan, on Israel’s eastern border, and it indicated the be ginnings of a move by the Vatican to become more involved in the Middle East situation. Pope John said: “It must be understood that Jews, who for 2000 years were dispe rsed among the nations of the world, had decided to return to the land of their a ncestors. That is their right.” Vatican hardliners have criticized the Pope’s growing role as the “protector of Jews,” but maybe this is just a fulfillment of prophecy. There does not appear to be any other figure on the world scene that could be considered as a candidate for the False Prophet oth er than the Pope, with the Roman Catholic Church being the World Church. However, do not misconstrue this as anti) Catholic rhetoric. The real history of the Catholic Church is not known to a large majority of its membership, and therefore, even though they have been deceived, it is wrong to indict those who have sincerely tried to live their lives according to the basic Christian tenets as they know them. It is probable that the C atholic Church, as well as the Protestant churches which make up the World Council of Churches, in the coming years, will be radically different, as liberalism a nd New Age become more pervasive in Religion– transforming these churches into shadows of their former selves.

The northern kingdom of Israel was conquered by the Assyrians around 722 BC, and the threat of captivity and slaughter forced th em to flee. Those people became known as the “ten lost tribes.” The other two tribe s, Benjamin and Judah (where the word “Jew” came from), remained in the south. Throu gh the years, Jerusalem and Palestine became one of the most overrun areas in t he world: Babylonian (587 BC)536 BC), Medo)Persian (536 BC)533 BC), Greek (331 BC)30 1 BC), Egyptian (301 BC)198 BC), Syrian (198 BC)63 BC), and Roman (63 BC)395 AD ). Most of the Jews had fled from the land, and only a small group remained in J erusalem until 70 AD, when the Romans burned the city. By 135, all of the Jews had been driven out. Still the area continued to be the subject of contention as it was conquered by the Byzantine (396) 638), Mohammedan (639)1099), Crusader (1100)1291), Moslem (1292), Egyptian) Mamaluke (1292)1917), and Turks (1917). "},{"pageNumber":782,"pageContent":" Map of Israel In 1895, Theodor Herzl, an Austrian Jew, wrote a bo ok called The Jewish State ( Der Judenstadt ) that began the movement towards the establishment of an independent Jewish state. In 1897, he arranged the first World Zionist Congress in Basle, Switzerland. Now known as ‘Zionists’ (for Mount Zio n in Palestine), a fund was started to raise money to buy land, and a blue and white fl ag was chosen, the colors of the tallith prayer shawl. Herzl traveled around the wor ld, especially in Europe, to lobby for his group. In 1903, a year before he died, England offered the Jews the African country of Uganda, which they rejected, because they knew t hat Palestine was their country. According to the Bible (Gen. 15:18), Israel’s promi sed land stretches from the Nile River in Egypt to the Euphrates in Syria, and includes th e countries of Syria and Lebanon."},{"pageNumber":783,"pageContent":" Theodor Herzl Israeli flag In 1904, Dr. Chaim Weizmann (who would become Israe l’s first President), was made Assistant Professor of Biological Chemistry at the University of Manchester in England.

During World War I, German y was producing 250,000 shells a day, while England was only producing 2,500, due to a shortage of acetone because of the lack of wood alcohol. Weizmann isolated an o rganism capable of transforming the starch of cereals, most notably that of maize, and later chestnuts, into acetone butyl alcohol. Because of these advanced experimentations and the contribution of explosives (TNT) to the allied cause, Weizmann was credited with saving the British Army. The only thanks he wanted, was for Palestine to be established as a national homeland for the Jews. "},{"pageNumber":784,"pageContent":" Chaim Weizmann The Sykes)Picat Agreement was a secret wartime agre ement between England and France to divide between them the lands of the Otto man Empire once World War 1 ended. Among the terms was the establishment of an Arab state in ‘southern Palestine.’ However, the Arabs became upset that Britain decide d to instead engineer its own rule over all Palestine through the League of Nations. E ngland essentially ruled Palestine as a colony until 1948. On November 2, 1917, the British Foreign Secretary Lord Arthur James Balfour sent this declaration to Lord Lionel Walter Rothschild: “His Majesty’s Government views with favor the esta blishment in Palestine of a national home land for the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavors to facilitate the achievement of this object, it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and rel igious rights of existing non) Jewish communities in Palestine or the rights and p olitical status enjoyed by Jews in any other country.” Arthur James Balfour On December 9, 1917, Gen. Edmund Allenby marched in to Jerusalem, and when the Turks heard that he was on his way, they interp reted ‘Allenby’ to mean ‘Allah Nebi’ (‘Prophet of God’), and took it as a sign that God was against them. They were also worried about the accompanying airplanes (from the 14th Bomber Squadron of the"},{"pageNumber":785,"pageContent":"Royal Flying Corp), which they had never seen befor e. They were thinking about the promise in Isaiah 31:5: “As birds flying, so will t he Lord of Hosts defend Jerusalem; defending also he will deliver it; and passing over he will preserve it.” The Turks left the city. Edmund Allenby An interesting fact to add to this narrative can be found in Daniel 12:12. Some believe that the 1335 ‘days’ may refer to the actua l date that Palestine was delivered from Moslem rule. Since the land in Daniel’s day wa s under Moslem rule, the date given would most likely be in Moslem terms, not in Jewish or Gregorian. A coin minted in Turkey showed the Gregorian date of 1917 on one sid e, and the Moslem date of 1335 on the other side. Is this a fulfillment of prophec y? After the War, the 1919 Paris Peace Conference at V ersailles established the League of Nations, who approved the Balfour Declara tion and granted a mandate for Great Britain to govern the Palestine area. Within a couple of years, a Select Committee on Estimates, of the British House of Commons, repo rted that “large numbers of Jews, almost amounting to a second Exodus, have been migr ating from Eastern Europe to the American zones of Germany and Austria with the inte ntion in the majority of cases of finally making their way to Palestine. It is clear that it is a highly organized movement, with ample funds and great influence behind it, but the Subcommittee was unable to obtain any real evidence who are the real instigato rs.” A U.S. Senate War Investigating Committee report said that a “heavy migration of Je ws from Eastern Europe into the American Zone of Germany is part of a carefully org anized plan financed by special groups in the United States.” Even though nobody wa s to leave the Soviet Union without government permission, many Jews were allow ed to leave, so they could return to their homeland. In 1937, a Royal Commission was established by Engl and which divided the country of Palestine into three sections: Jewish, Arab and English. With the increased tension, the UN Security Council later went soft, and the Tr uman Administration reversed their earlier support, urging that the partition proposal be suspended, in lieu of a ‘trusteeship.’ Jewish terrorist groups, such as the Stern gang, an d the Irgun Zvai Leumi (led by Menachem Begin), worried that a Jewish State would not materialize, began attacking Arabs. Time magazine reported that they “stormed the village o f Deir Yasin and"},{"pageNumber":786,"pageContent":"butchered everyone in sight. The corpses of 250 Ara bs, mostly women and small children, were tossed into wells.” Rather than risk ing the possibility of further massacres, the Arab settlers fled the country to li ve in neighboring countries. Menachem Begin On April 29, 1947, the UN took on the responsibilit y of settling the Palestinian situation. Facing a Jewish refugee crisis because o f mass emigration into Palestine that they could no longer control, England acceded to Re solution 181 of the newly)founded United Nations which called for a partition of the British)ruled area into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem as a separate entit y administered by the UN. Palestinian Jews approved the plan, but Palestinian Arabs and neighboring Arab countries rejected it. On May 14, 1948, the British Union Jack in Jerusale m was lowered, and at 4 p.m., David Ben)Gurion (the first Prime Minister) read th e Declaration of Independence over the airwaves in a radio broadcast from the Tel Aviv Museum. At 6:10 p.m. President Truman made an official statement of recognition, m aking the United States one of the first countries to extend diplomatic recognition to the new independent state of Israel.   Da vid Ben)Gurion Andrei Gromyko "},{"pageNumber":787,"pageContent":"In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Andrei Grom yko, the Russian Ambassador, announced his support for an independen t Jewish State in Palestine, and urged the Arabs to accommodate them. The entire Com munist bloc voted to support Israel. They followed their show of support with a strong program which included financial support and military equipment. The Sovie t Union was hoping that Israel would become another communist satellite. When it became apparent that Israel would not go communist, Russia discontinued diplomatic relations with them on February 23, 1953, and the Cominform denounced Zionism as an “agency o f American imperialism.” Another variation of one of the numerical theories given earlier purports to indicate the foretelling of the establishment of Israel as a n independent Jewish State, and the end of the dispersal of the Jewish people throughou t the world. The calculation goes like this: 2,520 biblical years X 360 biblical days = 907,200 days, divided by our calendar year of 365.25 days = 2,483.8 calendar years, which added to the end of the Babylonian captivity in 536 BC, leads us to the yea r of 1948. When British troops left the area, they said it wou ld be a matter of weeks before the Arabs would take over the new country. On May 15th, the official date of statehood, when Ben)Gurion was broadcasting Israel’s appreciat ion to the U.S. for their recognition, an explosion sounded, after which he s aid: “A bomb has just fallen on this city from an enemy aircraft flying overhead.” An Ar ab alliance of Egypt, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Yemen, Lebanon, and Jordan had attac ked Israel. Even though the newly formed nation was poorly armed, they survived, and actually increased their territory by 600 miles. The 1949 Armistice gave them 21% more la nd than they had originally been given by the United Nations. Prior to 1948, the Jewish people were known as ‘Pal estinians.’ There was a Palestinian Post newspaper, a Palestinian Brigade of Jewish volunte ers in the British Army during World War II, and an all)Jewish Palesti nian Symphony Orchestra. Arab inhabitants living in the new country of Israel wan ted to differentiate themselves from the Jews, and began called themselves Palestinians. However, the underlying purpose for this was to generate the misconception that it was a distinct nationality, and that ‘Palestine’ was their ancestral homeland, when in f act, they are actually similar in language and customs to the Arabs of Syria and Jord an, where their ancestors probably came from. On July 26, 1956, Gamal Abdel Nasser, President of Egypt, seized control of the Suez Canal, and announced that the profits would go towards building the Aswan Dam. Egypt moved into a close alliance with Russia as bi llions of dollars worth of military equipment, along with Soviet advisors, poured into the country. On October 29th, Israeli forces overran the Gaza Strip, and had it not been for the UN Resolution that ordered a cease fire, Egypt would have fallen to Israel."},{"pageNumber":788,"pageContent":"   Gamal Abdel Nasser  Moshe Daya n Many years ago I came across this unsubstantiated r eport. On November 7, 1957, the Jerusalem Post reported that at 6:03 a.m., Moshe Dayan radioed to twenty of his soldiers stationed in the Sinai Desert, that three Egyptian divisions, 18,000 men, were on their way. They men bowed down, and prayed to th e ‘God of their Fathers’ to have the strength to die, rather than face being capture d. When they got up, they saw the Egyptian strike force engaged in retreat. Behind th ese lines was a car, which the Israelis captured. Inside the car was one of Nasser’s comman ding generals, who said that they were retreating because they had been surrounded by an army dressed in white. Israel had no such army there. The 18,000 soldiers were ne ver heard from again. A six)week search in Israel, the Sinai Desert, and Egypt faile d to turn up any clues. Since it was already established that Israel did not have the re sources to capture such a large number of men, what could have happened? National Geographic reported that on November 7, 1957, at 6:33 a.m. there was an earthqu ake of substantial proportions on the Sinai peninsula, which lead to the speculation that the army could have been swallowed up by the earth. If this report was true, it most certainly was a sign that the Jews were indeed God’s chosen people. The Soviet Union began sending equipment to Iraq an d Syria, while they continued to interfere in the internal affairs of other Arab nations through military coups and political assassinations. Only U.S. and British int ervention prevented Communist takeovers in the Middle East, as in July 1958, when the Marines landed in Lebanon; and British forces, supporting King Hussein, landed in Jordan. On March 16, 1965, Nasser promised the Arabs an all )out offensive effort against Israel, if they would unite under him, as he hoped to become the President of the United States of Africa. He said: “We must arm 5,000,000 m en and overwhelm the Israelis by sheer military might.” In 1967, Russia sent exaggerated reports to Egypt a nd Syria that Israel was preparing for war against Syria. This was a move by Syria to unify the Arab bloc countries. In a book written by Nasser, he revealed that his chief goal was to eliminate Israel as a nation, and to push them into the sea. On May 26th he said: “The Arab people want to fight. We have been waiting for the right time when we will be completely ready.” On May 28th he said: “We will not accept an y co)existence with Israel.” On June 4th he said, concerning Israel: “We are facing you in battle and are burning with desire"},{"pageNumber":789,"pageContent":"for it to start to obtain revenge.” The source of N asser’s hatred for Israel can be traced back to a statement he made in December, 1962: “We feel the soil of Palestine is the soil of Egypt, and the whole Arab world. Why do we mobilize? Because we feel that the land of Palestine is part of our land, and we are r eady to sacrifice ourselves for it.” Nasser ordered the UN to remove their troops, which they did; and he closed the crucial port of Eliat, on the Gulf of Aquaba, and b lockaded the Tiran Straits. He then taunted Israel’s Chief of Staff Yitzhak Rabin by sa ying: “Let him come, I’m waiting.” The armies of Egypt, Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon surroun ded Israel on all sides. Joining them were Iraq, Algeria, Kuwait, Sudan, and other A rab nations, which represented 25 times more manpower than Israel could field. On the evening of June 4, 1967, Nasser moved his Russian)made tanks and artillery into pos ition. He knew that with America caught up in the Vietnam War, there would be no hel p for Israel. Yitzhak Rabin As daylight broke on June 5th, Israeli jets flew lo w from the north and began bombing the Egyptian Air Force. Israeli ships trade d fire with Egypt’s naval power, and Israeli tanks rolled into the Sinai. As the events unfolded, Russia warned the major countries of the world to back)off, so the world sa t back and waited, expecting a swift Arab victory. The victory never came. By the second day, Arab leaders watched their military being ground to bits. After six days, the Arab alliance was in retreat as Israeli soldiers captured the Sinai peninsula up to the Sue z Canal, the Golan Heights including Mount Hermon (which would then become the “eyes and ears of Israel,” the entire West Bank of the River Jordan, and reclaimed the city of Jerusalem. Schlomo Goren, Ashkenazic (of Eastern European origin) Chief Rabbi of Israel, carried the Scrolls of the Law, and sounded the ram’s horn of repentance. In H ebrew, ‘shofar’ (ram’s horn) is the word that ‘jubilee’ is derived from. In Leviticus 2 5:8)9, a ‘jubilee’ is represented as 49 years. There was a 49 year difference between 1917, when Gen. Allenby entered Jerusalem, and 1967, when the Jews took complete co ntrol. Gen. Moshe Dayan said: “We have returned to our holiest of holy places, ne ver to be parted from it again ... No power on earth will remove us from this spot again. ” "},{"pageNumber":790,"pageContent":" Schlomo Goren Seeing that their plan was failing, Russia called f or a ceasefire. In those six short days, the Arabs lost three billion dollars of milit ary equipment, and the Israelis captured $700 million in new Soviet military hardware. Over 15,000 Arab lives were lost, but only 776 Israelis. Israel increased their territory from 8,000 to 34,000 square miles. Moshe Dayan, Israel’s Minister of Defense, said afterward s: “Our next war will be with Russia.” After the Israeli victory over the Arabs in 1948, J ordan maintained possession of Judea, Samaria, and the eastern part of Jerusalem, and expelled all the Jews and destroyed their synagogues. They renamed the area t he ‘West Bank.’ Their purpose was to convince the world that these territories we re the ancestral lands of the Jordanian Kingdom, when in fact it is well document ed that the land belonged to the Jews. Even after the Arabs were driven out of this area during the 1967 war, they still referred to this territory as the West Bank in an e ffort to continue swaying public opinion. In the years that followed, Russia continued to arm Egypt, Syria, and other Arab countries. However, by 1972, Anwar Sadat, the Presi dent of Egypt, felt that Russia was trying to control the Middle East, and he ended his country’s alliance with them. Egypt and Saudi Arabia joined forces so they wouldn’t hav e to rely on Russia. Syria then became the main recipient of Soviet arms.

On October 6, 1973, which was Yom Kippur, the Jewish Day of Atonement, Egypt, Syria, Jordan and eight ot her Arab nations joined together in a surprise attack against Israel. Much of the Israe li air force was destroyed by Soviet SAM ground)to)air missiles, and only 100 of 265 Isr aeli tanks survived the first wave, giving the Arabs a 5 to 1 edge in armor superiority . Nixon was very adamant about the U.S. position when he said: “If Russia disturbs the balance of power in the Middle East, the United States will move to assure Israel’s secu rity.” With reports that the Soviets were airlifting supplies to Egypt, and Iraqi troops were on their way to support Syria, Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir began considering the nuclear option, and made an urgent plea to the U.S. Israel no longer had the military hardware to wage an effective war. They needed missiles, ammunition, tanks, and planes. An amazing story that came out of this war had to do with Tzvika Greengold, who was the leader of a group of three Israeli tanks on the Golan Heights, where they were to hold off onco ming Syrian tanks. Somehow he got separated from the other two, so he drove up a hill and destroyed three enemy tanks. He repositioned himself only to see a column of thirty Syrian tanks heading his way. He shot the first, changed positions, and kept shooting. By the time he was done, he had destroyed ten of the tanks, and the Syrians began to retreat because they thought they were being attacked by a larger Israel i force. Nixon responded to Meir’s appeal by saying: “Send e verything that can fly.” In a commitment to stand by them in their darkest hour, he also sent in two carrier battle groups to the eastern Mediterranean Sea, and when t he Soviets threatened to intervene by dropping paratroopers into the Sinai, our milita ry alert level was raised to DEFCON 3. In a 31)day airlift, a $2.2 billion emergency ai d shipment code)named Operation Nickel Grass, the U.S. sent in shipments of ammunit ion, fighter)bombers, and tanks.

With the tide turned, Israel again prevailed, taking even more territory. Again Russia urged the UN to order a ceasefire. Sadat’s terms for a ceasefire was for Israel to wit hdraw from all territory it took during the 1967 war. American and Soviet pressure turned t his Israeli victory into a negotiated compromise. The Arabs punished the world for their support of Israel by initiating an oil embargo against all the nations, such us the United States, who were partial to Israel. This move created worldwide economic chaos. In 1977, Israeli Chief of Staff Mordechai Gur said publicly that Egypt was again preparing for war, basing his assumption on an unpr ecedented military buildup that was part of a two)year $6 billion arms modernization pl an. Jimmy Carter, said in a 1978 meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin: “I can say, without reservation, as President of the United States of America, that we will continue to do so (remain committed to Israel’s security), not just for thirt y years, but forever.” However, in 1978, President Carter was able to get Prime Minister Men achem Begin (Israel) and Anwar Sadat (Egypt) together to sign the Camp David Peace Accord, which led to the return of the Sinai to Egypt, and full recognition of Israel by Egypt, including the establishment of embassies and trade relations. Begin, Carter and Sadat On November 5, 1978, the 21)nation Arab League met in Baghdad and established a $3.5 billion war fund “to continue the armed conf rontation with the Jewish State”; and in 1980, a 37)nation Islamic Summit called for a ‘H oly War’ to liberate all Arab land, including Jerusalem, to establish an independent Pa lestinian state, with an Arab Jerusalem as its capital. The proposal was rejected by Egypt because of their commitment to the Peace Accord. During 1980)81, Israel passed two key laws that cha nged the nature of the Middle East conflict: they named Jerusalem, including East Jerusalem and the Old City (captured from Jordan in 1967) as Israel’s Eternal Capital (although most of the world still maintains embassies in Tel Aviv); and annexed the Golan Heights (captured from Syria in 1967).

They were part of a six)machine shipment to Austria by a U.S. manufacturer. The whereabouts of the other four were not known. The s hocking implication of that discovery, was that the shelf life of the K)rations (meal packets) were only six months, which led many to believe the Israel thwarted a Rus sian invasion of Israel that was planned for the fall of 1982. After an eight)year long war with Iran, in 1988, Sa ddam Hussein, in a bid to become the preeminent leader of the Arab world, offered to put his military at the disposal of the Palestinian effort. Iraq had been a partner in most of Arab attacks on Israel, and during the Persian Gulf War, Hussein threatened to “burn h alf of Israel.” However, in 1989, Yasser Arafat showed his willingness to seek a solu tion to the Mid)East situation by acknowledging Israel’s right to exist, and expressi ng a desire to begin negotiations to establish a Palestinian political authority that co uld coexist with Israel. Saddam Hussein Salah Khalaf Abu lyad, Yasir Arafat’s chief deputy, said on January 1, 1991: “Now we accept the formation of the Palestinian state in part of Palestine, in the Gaza Strip and West Bank. We will start from that part and we will liberate Palestine, inch by inch.” In August 20, 1993, in the Norwegian capital of Osl o, Yitzhak Rabin (Israel) and Yasser Arafat (head of the Palestinian Liberation O rganization) reached an agreement, known as the Declaration of Principles (or Oslo Acc ords), in an attempt to end its armed struggle in exchange for gradual Palestinian autono my (through the creation of the Palestinian Authority) over parts of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, which was later extended to Nablus, Jenin, Bethlehem, Ramallah, Qal qilya, Tulkarm, and Hebron in 1995. The two leaders also signed Letters of Mutual Recognition, in which the Israeli government recognized the PLO as the legitimate rep resentative of the Palestinian people; and the PLO recognized Israel’s right to ex ist, and also renounced terrorism, violence, and their desire for the destruction of t he State of Israel.

The Dead Sea, located between Israel and Jordan, wh ich is 1,296 feet below sea level, is the lowest spot on the surface of the Ear th. It is fifty miles long and eleven miles wide (about 500 square miles), and has a depth of 1 ,200 feet at its deepest point. Known as the ‘Sea of Salt,’ because it is ten times saltier than ocean water, it is fed by the Jordan River, and has no outlet. Its waters hav e evaporated for hundreds of years in the extreme heat, at a rate of 280 million cubic fe et per day, leaving behind a variety of minerals. With a concentration of 32% of dissolved ingredients, in a “unique composition” of mostly sodium chloride (salt), whil e regular ocean water has only 3.5% to 4%; it is the richest mineral source in the worl d.

The sun hea ts the shallow salt water, and the heat is trapped in the dense salt layer on the bottom, and becomes hot enough to turn a turbine, thus producing electricity. Scientists have also discovered an algae, known as Dunaliella, which can survive in, and has adapted to, the extremely salty conditions.

It seems there are plenty of resources in this smal l country that could be garnished for the benefit of an attacking nation. THE ARK OF THE COVENANT The purpose of building the Temple was to house the Ark of the Covenant, so the discovery of the most sacred item in Jewish history may be all that is needed to initiate the rebuilding of the Temple. However, Jeremiah 27: 22 seems to indicate a connection between the Temple treasures, and the existence of the Temple. According to Ezra, after the first Temple was destroyed, the Temple ve ssels had to be returned or refabricated before the Temple could be rebuilt. Th us, only the existence of the Temple vessels may be all that is needed to rebuild the Te mple, since it is believed that the Ark was not in the second Temple. The Ark was a rectangular box four feet long, and t wo feet high, made of acacia wood (distinguished as a type of wood that does not decay), and covered with gold; with two cherubs (a rank of angels) looking down and fac ing each other on its lid with outstretched wings, which was known as the mercy se at. It was constructed at Mount Sinai by Bezalel, according to the instructions Mos es received from God. Inside was"},{"pageNumber":800,"pageContent":"placed the rod of Aaron, a pot of manna (which had been sent by God to feed the Israelites during their time of wandering in the wi lderness), and the two tablets of the Law given to Moses (known as the Ten Commandments). Some sources also claim that it contains the original Books of Moses. It represe nted the divine presence of God, and was the point where the literal manifestation of Go d on this Earth took place. Just looking at it was known to cause death. The Bible t ells us of the power it possessed. It caused the Jordan River to part (Joshua 3:8 ) 4:11) , aided in the destruction of Jericho (Joshua 6:4)21 ), and brought about numerous military victories when it was present. Needless to say, it developed quite a mystique. Ark of the Covenant Inside the Temple, the Ark was placed in a dark, wi ndowless room known as the Holy of Holies. A vale was placed around the Ark, a nd only once a year, on the Day of Atonement, the high priest was allowed to enter. Ev en then, he was to carry a container of burning incense, which filled the room with smok e, thus obscuring his view of the Ark. He would sprinkle the blood of a bullock on the gro und in front of the Ark, and on the mercy seat, as atonement for the sins of the priest s; and then the blood of a goat, as a symbolic atonement for the sins of the people. A ro pe would be tied around his waist, so if for some reason he accidentally touched the Ark and was killed, he could be pulled out without risk by the other priests. In the Bible, there are 200 references to the Ark o f the Covenant up to the time of Jeremiah, but nothing afterward. It has since disap peared, and nobody is really sure where it’s at. The common belief is that the Temple will not be rebuilt unless the Ark is found. The Ark had not been removed from the Temple during or after the reign of King Josiah, which had begun in 640 BC, and it was in pl ace in the Holy of Holies in 701 BC, which leaves 61 years in which it could have disapp eared. It is unlikely that Hezekiah (716)687 BC) would have allowed the Ark to be taken away. Between the time of his death, and Josiah’s reign, there were two other rul ers, Manasseh (687)642 BC) and Amon (642)640 BC). Amon discovered that Manasseh ha d been involved in a form of Baal worship, and had erected an image of Astarte ( Asherah) in the Temple (2 Kings 21:4)7, 2 Chronicles 33:7), and it is believed that he would have ordered the Levites to remove the Ark. The Ark reappeared in 622 BC (2 Kin gs 22:1)7, 2 Chronicles 34:8)33, 2"},{"pageNumber":801,"pageContent":"Chronicles 35:3), during the reign of Manasseh’s gr andson, King Josiah, who vanquished idolatry, repaired and purified the Temp le. However, idolatry took root again, and the actions of Rehoboam, Solomon’s son, caused the kingdom to be divided, with Judah (Judea ) in the south, and Israel to the north. Judgment came upon the Northern Kingdom in 7 21 BC when the Assyrians attacked them; and the Southern Kingdom paid the pr ice for they idolatry when the armies of Nebuchadnezzar, the Babylonian king, swep t through the land in 606 BC, and then again in 597 BC. During the second invasion, 2 Kings 24:13 says that “all the treasures of the house of the Lord, and the treasur e of the king’s house” were taken, and “all the vessels of gold which Solomon king of Israel had made in the temple of the Lord” had been cut in pieces. The original Temple w as destroyed in 586 BC by the Babylonian commander, Nebuzaradan (2 Kings 25:8)9), and the rest of the treasures were plundered and taken to a Babylonian temple at Shinar (Daniel 1:2), which has led some to theorize that what was taken previously cam e from the Temple treasury, since Nubuchadnezzar’s initial action against Judah was i n response to them not paying tribute to him. Through all of this, the Ark was not mentioned. Lis ts of Temple items (2 Kings 25:13) 17, Jeremiah 52:17)23) do not refer to any Temple t reasures from the Holy of Holies, and it is this silence that could indicate that it wasn’t captured, since there is a Biblical record of the time when the Philistines captured th e Ark. In addition, Ezra 1:7)11 states that all the captured items were later returned by the Persians, but the Ark was not discussed. So, either the Ark was destroyed along w ith the Temple (possibly indicated by the destruction of the “goodly vessels” in 2 Chr onicles 36:19), or the Ark was hidden before it could be found. When Rome invaded Judea in 63 BC, and the Roman Gen eral Pompey swept through Jerusalem, entering the Temple, and the Hol y of Holies, it was empty. Jewish history records the high priest making his offering upon the foundation stone of the Holy of Holies, and not the Ark. After Titus returned to Rome with some of the Temple treasure, the Arch of Triumph (or Arch of Titus) wa s built in 81 AD at the entrance to the Forum, in the Palatine section of Rome, to commemor ate his victory. It depicted the seven)branched candelabra known as the menorah (wit h an octagonal base, rather than a three)legged stand, which it actually has; w hich could indicate that it was a duplicate kept in the Treasury), the golden table o f the showbread, and the seven trumpets of the Jubilee. The Ark is not pictured, t hus adding to the evidence that the Ark was not in the second Temple, and has been hidden. According to the Mishnah (Sotah 9a), after the Temp le was built, the Tabernacle was stored under the “crypts of the Temple.” It is believed that King Solomon constructed a secret chamber in the recesses of the Temple Mount to hide the Ark, which is where it was placed during the reign of Ma nasseh. Jewish tradition has held that the Ark and the Altar of Incense were hidden i n a secret location under a woodshed on the western side of the Temple, near the Holy of Holies. This is not such a far)fetched idea when you realiz e that under the city of Jerusalem there is an underground city consisting of a number of tunnels, chambers, and cisterns; which were created to establish a water storage sys tem, as quarters for guards, chambers to hold sacrificial animals, rooms contain ing ritual bathing areas, prison cells, and storage areas for Temple treasures. The best kn own of these subterranean areas is"},{"pageNumber":802,"pageContent":"Hezekiah’s Tunnel, which was constructed to make su re Jerusalem would have fresh water in case the city was attacked. It started at Gihon Spring, and ran for a third of a mile, through solid rock, spilling into the Pool of Siloam.

The nine original members of the Knights Templar we re received by King Baldwin I (Baudouin) in Jerusalem in 1119, and they establish ed their headquarters in a wing of the al)Aqsa Mosque, which had been converted to a p alace. They were given complete access to the palace and various outbuildings which were on the site where Solomon’s Temple originally stood, which was adjacent to the Dome of the Rock. Although their goal was “to keep the road from the coast to Jerusa lem free from bandits,” for nine years they rarely left the palace grounds. It was a n unrealistic pledge, because it would have been difficult for the nine to patrol this fif ty mile road; besides, a military order known as the Knights of Saint John were already per forming that task before the Templars showed up. It is now known that they had s ome knowledge about the Temple treasures, because there is evidence which indicate s that they were engaged in a massive excavation project. A Knight Templar Vast arched subterranean rooms were used by Knights during the Crusades to keep horses, and were known as “Solomon’s Stables.” The Templars were aware of these hidden areas underneath the Temple grounds, and bel ieved that the Ark would be found there. They mounted an operation to plunder whateve r treasurers they could find. Although it is questionable that they found the Ark , it is believed that they discovered treasure, relics and ancient manuscripts dating bac k to the time of Moses. Israeli archaeologists, engaged in excavations on the south ern side of the Mount, found the exit point of a tunnel which had been dug by the Te mplars. It lead inward about 30 yards, where it was blocked by stone and debris. There has been many stories concerning the location of the Ark of the Covenant.

Jewish"},{"pageNumber":803,"pageContent":"historian Eupolemus wrote that many of the Temple t reasures had been plundered by Babylon, “except for the Ark and the tablets in it. This Jeremiah preserved.” According to the apocryphal Second Book of Maccabees 2:4)8, w hich has been dated to 163 BC, the prophet Jeremiah had concealed the Ark (as well as the Tabernacle, and the Altar of Incense) in a cave on “the mountain where Moses wen t up and beheld the heritage of God.” Some researchers believe that this could refe r to either Mount Sinai or Mount Nebo, which is located in what is now the country o f Jordan, and is the traditional burial place of Moses. The contention was made, that since these articles were made under the leadership of Moses, they may have been deposit ed at the site of his burial. Various archaeological expeditions had failed to turn up an ything there. During the 1920’s, American explorer, Antonio Frede rick Futterer, searched various locations in Jordan for the Ark, based on the clues in 2 Maccabees, and believed the location to be on Mount Pisgah, the highest peak on the Mount Nebo range. He claimed to have found an inscription on the sealed entrance of a tunnel which said: “Herein lies the golden Ark of the Covenant.” In 1981, while fol lowing Futterer’s map of Mount Pisgah, a gully was discovered by Tom Crotser, an A merican explorer, which led to a 4’ X 7’ tunnel that plunged 600 feet into the ground, ending at a wall, which when broken down, revealed a 10’ X 12’ crypt which held a recta ngular chest 62” long, 37” high and 37” wide, wrapped in a blue cloth, which he believe d to be the Ark. Beside it was another bundle, which he thought contained the carr ying poles, the cherubim which had been mounted on the top, and the legs. The cave is located near the Church of the Franciscan Fathers of Terra Santa, and is under a b uilding which contains the remains of an old Byzantine church. He didn’t disturb the f ind, thus he doesn’t know for sure what he saw. He reported it to the media, and he cl aimed that God told him to send the photographs he took to London banker David Rothschi ld, who some people have claimed is a direct descendant of Jesus, and has be en chosen to build the third Temple. Rothschild refused to accept the pictures, and they were returned to Crotser. Noted archaeologist Siegfried Horn visited his home in Wi nfield, Kansas to see the pictures. Only two had any images at all– one is fuzzy, but d oes show a chamber with a yellow box in the center. His opinion was that it was “not an ancient artifact but of modern fabrication... ” In January, 1979, archaeologist Ronald Wyatt, while sightseeing near the Damascus Gate, felt that the location of Jeremiah’s Grotto w as near an ancient stone quarry on the northern extension of Mt. Moriah, that is sometimes referred to as the ‘Calvary Escarpment’ (because it contains the skull face con figuration that has been connected to the Golgotha). He believed that during the Babyl onian siege of Jerusalem from 587) 586 BC, when the city was surrounded, it would have been impossible to remove the Ark, so it had to be there. With the permission of the landowner, and a permit from Israeli officials, he excavated the area. On Januar y 6, 1982, he entered a chamber that contained the Ark, and other artifacts from the fir st Temple, which had been hidden there by Jeremiah. The 22)foot long cave is actuall y located directly beneath the area where Christ was crucified. According to Wyatt’s re search, when Jesus was crucified, his blood flowed down to the ground, through a spli t in the rock, and onto the Ark. "},{"pageNumber":804,"pageContent":" Ronald Wyatt Most serious researchers doubt his claim, saying th at, as far back as the first Temple, the area of Mt. Calvary was used as burial grounds, so it is highly unlikely that the Ark would have been placed on defiled ground. S cholars have questioned his lack of archaeological training, and his techniques; yet Wyatt’s work gained more acceptance because of other discoveries, such as th e true Mt. Sinai, the location on the Red Sea crossing, Noah’s Ark, the 12 altars erected by Moses, Sodom and Gomorrah, and Abraham’s family tomb in Hebron. Plus, his work has produced the most information on the Ark, all of which seems to be co mpatible with Scripture. Dr. Gary Collett believes that Maccabees actually r efers to Qumran, and says that the layout of Cave IV is similar to the Temple, and that its lower level may have been the containment room used by Jeremiah to temporaril y protect the Ark. In 1992, two scientists from the Department of Geophysics and Pl anetary Science at Tel)Aviv University used a ground)breaking radar known as a molecular frequency analyzer and a seismic)reflection device near two caves at the W adi la)Chippah (‘the dome of the bridge’) which indicated the presence of a room con taining the same sort of pottery known to contain scrolls. Preliminary trenches dug in 1993 failed to turn up anything substantial. Once Christianity became the official religion of R ome, the treasures plundered by its legions fell into the possession of the Catholi c Church. Nelson Canode, of Amarillo, Texas, a former Benedictine monk at a monastery at Subiaco, Italy, about 30 miles from Rome, said that he was taken to a cave, four levels below the monastery, where ancient artifacts were being shuttled from there to the und erground vaults of the Vatican, and included the Ark and the disassembled Tabernacle. T here are many who believe that once Jerusalem becomes an international city, the V atican will return any Temple items in their possession. Because of the research done by Graham Hancock for his book The Sign and the Seal , some people think the Ark may be in Ethiopia. Men elik I, the royal son of King Solomon, returned to Ethiopia, after his mother, th e Queen of Sheba, died. When he was twenty years old, he returned to Israel, and So lomon treated him with so much favor, that the elders were jealous and wanted him to return home. Solomon agreed to send him home, on the condition that the first born sons of all the elders would go with him. Solomon wanted to give him a replica of the Ar k to take with him. However, Azarius, the son of Zadok, the High Priest, worried about the idol worship which was"},{"pageNumber":805,"pageContent":"flourishing, switched the Arks, and took the real o ne. Graham Hancock The Ark was taken to Egypt, on the island of Elepha ntine in the middle of the Nile, near Aswan, where a temple was built to protect it. It remained there for 200 years, until the temple was destroyed. The Ark was carried along the Nile, and the Takazze tributary into Ethiopia. They arrived at Lake Tana, which was considered a holy place. The Ark stayed on the island of Tana Kirkos for 800 years, where it was taken to the Church of St. Mary of Zion, which had been built in 372 to hold the Ark. During the 1530’s, when the Muslims attacked, it was moved to safety, but returned a hundred years later to a rebuilt St. Mary’s, which had been constructed on the ruins of the first. It remained there until 1965, when Emperor Haile Selas sie (who called himself the “Conquering Lion of Judah” and claimed to be a dire ct descendent of King Solomon) moved it to the Church of Zion near the center of A ksum (Axum), in northern Ethiopia. Though the communists overthrew the monarchy in 197 4, killed Selassie, and imprisoned much of the Royal family, the Ark remain ed safe because of its reputation for possessing an awesome amount of power, which ha s generated enough superstition to prevent people from trying to get to it. During all these years, the Ark has been guarded by Menelik’s descendents, and the descenden ts of those who accompanied him, who became known as ‘Falasha’ (exile) Jews, or the ‘Black Jews’ This area became part of the independent nation of Eritrea in 1993. It was alleged, that when Israel became a nation, a n appeal was made to Emperor Salassie to return the Ark. He said: “In principle, I agree that the Ark should be returned to the Temple, but the correct time has not yet com e.” Many researchers believe that the Ark is at the chapel at Aksum, although it has never been seen. "},{"pageNumber":806,"pageContent":" Haile Salassie Is Israel waiting for the discovery of the Ark, so they can rebuild the Temple; or are they waiting for the time when they can freely rebu ild their Temple, so they can retrieve the Ark and place it in the Holy of Holies? There a re some who share the suspicion, that Israel already knows where the Ark is, but also kno w that the political climate of their homeland is too volatile to take a chance on reveal ing its location until the right time. Unlike the Temple, the Ark is not mentioned in Bibl ical prophecy. As we have discovered, the Ark was not in the second Temple, s o the existence of the Ark is not necessary for the Temple to be rebuilt. However, if you turn on the 6 o’clock news, and you see that Israel is announcing the discovery of the Ark of the Covenant, this certainly will have a bearing on the prophetic timetable. REBUILDING THE JEWISH TEMPLE There is a school of thought that believes that onl y the Messiah can rebuild the Temple, because He would be the only one who knows the actual location of its foundation. This sentiment is the official position of the Israeli government. However, there is some evidence that seems to indicate that the Temple will be rebuilt prior to the return of Jesus. The Antichrist will sign a seven)year protectionary treaty with Israel (and perhaps other nations), but will break it halfway through w hen he causes the sacrifices to be discontinued (Dan. 9:27, Dan. 12:11), so that he wi ll be able to take “his seat in the Temple of God, displaying himself as being God (2 T hessalonians 2 :4, see also Rev. 11:1).” Matthew 24:15 refers to this area as the ‘h oly place.’ This seems to indicate that the Temple will already be in existence by this tim e. Moses prophesied that Israel would be punished twic e. The first was 430 years of captivity in Egypt, and the second was 70 years of slavery under the Babylonians. After that, three things were foretold: the Jewish nation would be reborn in Palestine, they would repossess old Jerusalem, and they would rebui ld their ancient Temple on its original site. In 1948, the nation of Israel was es tablished; in 1967, they took complete control of the city of Jerusalem; which leaves only one prophecy unfulfilled, and that is"},{"pageNumber":807,"pageContent":"the rebuilding of the Jewish Temple. Amos 9:11 says : “In that day will I raise up the tabernacle of David that is fallen, and close up th e breaches thereof; and I will raise up his ruins, and I will build it as in the days of ol d...” Prior to the construction of the Temple, God made H is divine presence known in a miqdash (‘holy place’), which was a temporary struc ture known as the Tabernacle, that was erected in various locations around Israel, suc h as Shiloh, Bethel, Dan, Gilgal, Mizpah, and Hebron. This continued until the Israel ites became united, both politically and spiritually, which took place when David conque red Jerusalem, thus creating a central location for their civil government and rel igious worship. When David realized the big difference between his own house, and the f act that the Ark was protected only by a tent (2 Sam. 7:12), he knew that he had to bui ld a house of God, which according to the Davidic Covenant (2 Sam. 7:4)17), seems to i ndicate that the site chosen would be a permanent location. In the 24th chapter of 2 Samuel, it is recorded how David counted his men to see if his army was going to be of sufficient military str ength. Because he didn’t trust God for his victory, so the Lord sent a destroying angel th at brought a plague against the people of Jerusalem. David built an altar and made peace o fferings to the Lord. This area on Mount Moriah (Mount Zion), was the site where God t ested Abraham’s faith by commanding him to sacrifice his son Isaac, and was known as the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite. David purchased the land in 9 90 BC, and in 960 BC, King Solomon began construction of the sacred Temple, wh ich was to provide a shelter for the Ark of the Covenant, the most sacred object in Israel. It took a workforce of 200,000 men seven years to complete this magnificent edific e, with funds gathered by David in a royal treasury. It was destroyed in 586 BC by Babyl onian invaders. King Solomon and the Temple The Persians conquered the Babylonians, and Cyrus, the Persian king, allowed 50,000 Jews to return to Jerusalem in 538 BC. In 53 7 BC, under the direction of King Cyrus, Zerubabbel (a descendant of King David), sup ervised a contingent of Phoenician workers who laid the foundation stones for the seco nd Temple. All the Temple vessels had been returned, the altar built, and the sacrifi ces resumed. Opposition by the Samaritans (descendants of Israelite and Assyrian i ntermarriage) in the north, who had a temple at Mount Gerizim, caused construction to b e discontinued until 520 BC, when Darius, the Persian king, instituted taxes to pay f or its construction. The Temple was"},{"pageNumber":808,"pageContent":"dedicated sometime between 516)514 BC. Another Pers ian king, Artaxerxes, appointed a Jew named Nehemiah as governor of Jerusalem, and he repaired the walls to protect the Temple, and began rebuilding the city. Judea soon came under the control of the Greeks (Al exander the Great); and the Egyptian Greeks (or Ptolemies), who allowed governo rship by the high priests. A third ruler, a Syrian Greek (Seleucid) known as Antiochus IV (Epiphanes), who sided with the Jewish faction known as the Hellenists, appointed a high priest who initiated pagan worship in opposition to the Orthodox faction. An a ttack in 170 BC killed many Jews, and again Temple treasures were taken. Antiochus de secrated the Temple by sacrificing a pig on the altar, placing a pagan ido l in the Holy of Holies, and burning copies of the Torah. An Orthodox priest named Matta thias Maccabee (“the hammerer”) began a revolt, which ended in 164 BC when his thir d son, Judas took control of Jerusalem, purified the Temple, and resumed the dai ly offerings. However, their control ended in 63 BC when Rome invaded. Over the years, the condition of the building decli ned, and around 20)19 BC, Herod the Great undertook the restoration of the Temple i n order to win the favor of the Jews. Most of the construction was completed within ten y ears, although minor restoration work continued until 64 AD. The rebuilt Temple, known as the Temple of Hero d, was twice as high, and much wider. During this period o f Roman rule, an imperial sacrifice had to be offered to the emperor, in addition to th e traditional Jewish sacrifice. This came to an end in 66 AD, when Eleazar, the son of a captain of the Temple, initiated an uprising of Jewish zealots, which brought the Tenth Legion from Rome. They failed to defeat the Jewish freedom fighters and a massive re volt ensued, which resulted in Judea being returned to the control of the Jews. Em peror Nero then sent Vespasian, Rome’s best military leader, and his army, to end t he rebellion. By 69 AD, Rome regained control of all Judea, except for Jerusalem . Vespasian, who became the new emperor, gave his son Titus the task of securing Je rusalem. A military operation was launched which ended in 70 AD, when the Temple was set on fire by the Roman Tenth Legion (consisting of 80,000 men) under Titus, who pried the Temple apart stone by stone, and threw them into the valley southeast of Jerusalem. A portion of the Western Wall (Kotel Maarabi), known as the Wailing Wall, wa s left standing by the Romans as a symbol of how powerful they were.

Although he had grown up under the teachings of Eusebius, Bishop of Cesarea, he turned away from those teachi ngs, and pushed for religious tolerance. His hatred of Christianity drove him to return Jerusalem back to the Jews, to restore Jewish law, and to advocate the rebuilding of the Jewish Temple. He freed them from taxes, and gave his support for the reestablis hment of animal sacrifices, but he was told that the Jews no longer practiced the ritu al because they had no Temple. Julian appointed Alypius of Antioch to oversee its building, while the governors of Syria and Palestine were instructed to assist. Workmen cl eared the debris, and work was begun in 363. When they tried to dig into the found ation, an earthquake occurred, which ignited pockets of natural gas underground, causing fires and explosions, destroying all the stones, wood and metal which were being stored on the site. A number of workers were killed. This was taken as a divine sign that t he Temple was not to be rebuilt at that time, and construction was halted after Julian died in the battle against the Persians. After the return to power by the Christian Roman Em perors, the idea was forgotten. The Church of the Holy Sepulcher was built on highe r ground in 326 by Byzantine Christians during Constantine’s rule, on the tradit ional site (according to Catholics) of Jesus’ crucifixion, burial and resurrection. Across from the Temple Mount, it was actually intended to symbolically replace the Templ e, which is why its layout is reminiscent of the Temple. As a way of offending Je ws, the condition of the Temple area was allowed to deteriorate and was even used a s a repository for human waste and other refuse. Church of the Holy Sepulcher In 614, the Persians broke through Byzantine defens es, and with the help of the Jews, defeated Heraclius. Chosroes II, the Persian King, placed a Jew named, ironically, Nehemiah, as the governor of the city, and gave them permission to rebuild the Temple. Although it is believed that the sacrif ices were resumed, no construction was initiated. About fifteen years later, Heraclius returned to take over the city, building an octagonal church on the site.

No Islamic tradition was connected to the site. Even the Quran (Surah V, v. 21), the Islamic holy scripture, states that the Jews have a historic claim on the land. Ho wever, the event known as the ‘Night Journey of Muhammad’ (or ‘hijrah’), when he fled fr om Mecca to Medina, was connected to Jerusalem, because it mentioned al)Aqs a, which is the name of the Mosque south of the Dome of the Rock. LinguisticaIl y, ‘al)aqsa,’ when it is translated, means ‘far corner,’ and could very well refer to Me cca. Therefore, the Temple Mount is said to be the rock where Muhammed received his ins tructions from God, and ascended into Heaven.

The I sraeli Antiquities Authority, and"},{"pageNumber":813,"pageContent":"most Israeli archaeologists agree that this traditi onal location was the site of the Temple. In 1967, even though Israel captured East J erusalem during the Six)Day War, a month later, as a gesture of peace and cooperatio n, Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Dayan returned control of the Temple Mount back to the Wakf (Islamic authority). It was later reported that he had an underlying fear that the ground would be razed to make way for the rebuilding of the Temple. Only the tip of the huge rock, on the summit of Mt. Moriah, juts up into the center of the Dome of the Rock. It is unclear whether the roc k was the sacrificial altar, or the Holy of Holies where the Ark was placed, but the presenc e of drain holes bored into the surface, which leads to a cave below the Mosque, ma y indicate that it was the area of the Temple used for sacrifices. The purpose of the holes was for the blood from animal sacrifices to runoff into a canal which carried the fluids out of the complex. This would place the Holy of Holies in an area which slopes do wnward, and creates a conflict with archaeological evidence and historical tradition. There is some support for the idea that the rock wa s the foundation stone for the Holy of Holies. The argument for this is based on t he assumption that one of the Temple gates, known as Warren’s Gate (which was beneath th e Gate Babel)Mat’hara, and up to 1967 was the location of an Arab latrine), opened d irectly in front of the Holy of Holies. In 1867, Charles Warren found an ancient gate to th e Temple Mount, and since then, the entire Western Wall, and a tunnel running along it, called the Rabbinic Tunnel, was discovered and excavated by 1986; along with four o ther entrances, by Israel’s Ministry of Religious Affairs and the Western Wall Heritage Foundation. The Western Wall of the Temple, left standing by Rome as a symbol of their authority, was part of the retaining wall which was erected to support the immense platf orm which held the Temple. In March, 1979, where excavations were being done a t the Western Wall, an unsubstantiated report was circulated, that a workm an, digging with his fingers, 80 feet below the existing floor, discovered the Arch of Ki ng Solomon from the original Temple, which led to the Holy of Holies. The archway of sto ne was constructed with a special mortar containing broken glass, as per God’s instru ctions. Tests taken of the glistening mortar indicated that it was produced during that p eriod. They would not break through the Wall, because according to the Law, only a Jew from the tribe of Levi, and the family of Aaron, can enter the Holy of Holies. In July, 1981, Rabbi Meir Yehuda Getz, chief rabbi of the Western Wall, while building a new synagogue behind the Western Wall, i nvestigated water emanating from the Wall, and discovered a great hall (26’ wide X 9 8’ high x 82’ long) behind a former cistern which contained an arch, believed to be one of the entrances to the Temple. It turned out to be the gate discovered by Warren, whi ch led to the Temple court, and was the closest gate to the Holy of Holies. A group of ten men, some from the Ateret Cohanim Yeshiva, began clearing the hall, working t heir way toward the Holy of Holies. If the Rock was the foundation stone of the Holy of Holies, then tradition holds that beneath this stone there is a chamber created by So lomon which was later used to hide the Ark. Getz believes that this secret chamber con tains the Ark, the table, and the menorah. After breaking down another wall, the Musl im authorities were made aware of what was going on, and the Arabs instigated a riot which led to the excavation site being shut down. A wall was placed over the entrance to t he tunnel, and was later reinforced with another wall of steel and plaster, which in 19 92 was redone to give it an"},{"pageNumber":814,"pageContent":"appearance of natural rock. Rabbi Schlomo Goren bel ieves that they came within 300 feet of this room, and rumors have circulated that Getz saw the Ark, which he denied, saying that the area is under water. Getz said: “Th e treasures of the First Temple are under the Mount, and we know exactly where they are ...” Schlomo Goren There was an unsubstantiated report that there is a lower cave, blocked by a slab, which was discovered in 1911. It had been alleged t hat the Crown of David, the Sword of Solomon, the Ark of the Covenant, the Tables of the Law, and a large amount of gold was discovered there, having been hidden by the pri ests when the Temple was destroyed. It is believed that these articles were removed, and their whereabouts are unknown. The Israelis have been kept from rebuilding, or eve n doing much archaeological excavation because of their strained relationship w ith the Arabs, and because the Moslems fear that such excavations would weaken the structure of the Mosque. Others would argue that it’s because any significant archa eological discoveries on the site would prove Israel’s ancient claim to the Mount. Be cause of the lack of any substantial information, there is even a lot of doubt as to whe re on the Temple Mount the sanctuary was actually located. Father Bellarmino Bagatti, A Franciscan researcher, published a report in 1979, that, based on measurements and information in ancient do cuments, the Temple was located on the southern end of the Mount between th e Dome of the Rock, and the al) Aqsa Mosque, and seems to be supported by the exist ence of underground reservoirs and tunnels. The Holy of Holies is believed to be l ocated over the Al Kas Foundation. "},{"pageNumber":815,"pageContent":" Bellarmino Bagatti Dr. Ze’ev Yeiven, and Dr. Asher Kaufman believe tha t Arab construction on the northern end exposed an ancient wall near the Dome of the Rock, which is believed to be the eastern wall of the Temple’s Court of Women. Of particular interest is an exposed area of rock in an open area of the Mount, about 330 feet north of the Dome of the Rock, which is covered by a small building (cup ola), known as the Qubbat el)Arwah (Dome of the Spirits), which is on an east)west ali gnment with the Eastern Gate and the Mount of Olives. It is also called the Qubbat el)Al ouah (Dome of the Tablets), because it is believed that this was the location of the Holy of Holies in the original Temple, where the Ark of the Covenant was placed. If this is true , that means that the Temple can be rebuilt without disturbing the Arab site, because t he Mosque, which takes up an area of 34 acres, would actually be separated from most of the Temple foundation by many feet of rubble. Proponents of this theory claim they hav e identified the area on the Mount of Olives which was used for the sacrifice of the Red Heifer, which further indicates that the Temple was not on the site of the Dome of the R ock. Ernest Martin, a scholar, and author of many books, said that the Temple was built over the Gihon Spring. Some Orthodox Jews believe that before the Temple c an be rebuilt, both the Dome of the Rock and the al)Aqsa Mosque would have to be removed, because their presence defiles the sacred ground. Before the Six)Day War, a quarter)page ad appeared in the Washington Post , seeking aid for the rebuilding of the Temple. They have been selling bonds to finance its building since 1948. The document known as the ‘Tem ple Scroll,’ which was part of the Dead Sea Scrolls found at Qumran, give distinct ins tructions concerning the construction of the Temple, and a group known as th e Ne’emanei Har Habayit (Faithful of the Temple Mount) commissioned a model of the Te mple to be built. It has been reported that the cornerstones are already cut and ready. Harvey A. Smith, a Jewish Assemblies of God minister, wrote in his book, that they have the biggest and heaviest stones cut, and secretly placed under the Temple Mo unt behind Warren Gate. The Temple music has even been deciphered. After the Six)Day War, Israel Eldad, a noted histor ian who was interviewed by Time"},{"pageNumber":816,"pageContent":"magazine, said: “We are at the stage where David wa s when he liberated Jerusalem. From that time until the construction of the Temple by Solomon, only one generation passed. So it will be with us.” In December, 1970, a special school called “Yeshiva Avodas Hakodesh” founded by Rabbi Hirsh Ha)Cohen (Cohens have been identified a s the descendants of the priests in the original Jewish temple), was established to train students from the tribe of Levi in the ancient ritual of animal sacrifice. It was dedi cated during the Feast of Dedication (Chanuka). Only students who can trace their lineag e back to Aaron can be admitted. Motti Dan (Ha)Cohen), who is said to be a descenden t of the priestly line, studied all the rules in regard to the Temple service, and establis hed the “Ateret Cohanim Yeshiva” in the 1970’s as a religious school to educate and tra in others, of similar descent, for the priesthood. In 1978, Hebrew University began offering a two)yea r course in the restoration of animal sacrifice, including all methods and Old Tes tament requirements. The first class graduated on June 1, 1980, and among their graduati on exercises, was to perform the ancient rite of animal sacrifice. An episode of “60 Minutes” in March, 1985, in a segment called “One Step in Heaven,” indicated that rabbini cal students in Jerusalem were studying the Jewish rites of animal sacrifice under Rabbi Shlomo Goren, the former Chief Rabbi of the Israeli Defense Forces, who had said in a November, 1981 Newsweek interview that the secret of the location of the A rk would be revealed just prior to the third Temple being built. The animal s acrifices will resume when the Temple is rebuilt. The Institute for Talmudic Commentaries, run by Rab bi Nahman Kahane (a descendent of the priestly line), which is located in the Young Israel Synagogue, is involved in the study of the Temple rituals and cer emonies, and have been involved in research to catalog all known cohanim (priests) in Israel. The Atara L’yoshna (“restoring the crown to its original form”), a branch of Kahan e’s group, has established a Study and Tourist Center near the Western Wall, where the y have models of the Tabernacle, the two original Temples, the new Temple, the Ark o f the Covenant, a menorah, as well as other Temple implements. A group called the Temple Mount Faithful (or the Te mple Mount and Eretz Yisrael Faithful Movement), started by Gershon Salomon, a p rofessor of Oriental Studies at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, sought to take sole control of the Temple Mount to rebuild the Temple. It was a reactionary movement t o protest the move by Moshe Dayan, the Israeli Defense Minister, who allowed th e Muslims to maintain control of the Temple Mount area in 1967. He went to court in 1987 with claims by physicist Dr. Asher Kaufman, and archaeologist Dan Bahat, that the Arab s were destroying valuable archaeological evidence from the first and second T emples. The group has also made attempts to lay a special 4)ton cornerstone on the Mount. The Temple Institute was esablished in Israel, in 1 988, by Rabbi Israel Ariel, who in 1967, was the first paratrooper to reach the Wester n Wall. Time magazine printed a two)page article on the group in October, 1989, and ABC)TV’s news show “20/20” televised a segment on them. On October 18, 1989, t he first bi)annual Conference on Temple Research was held.

Many of the 103 items which were used in the original Temple have been produced , or are in various stages of fabrication, including the gold crown of the high p riest, the Temple garments, a copper washbasin to be used for purification purposes, inc ense utensils, and silver trumpets to beckon worshippers to the Temple.

Moshe Katzav Before Temple services can be legally reinstated ac cording to Biblical Law, a ritual cleansing must be performed which involves the sacr ifice of the Red Heifer (Numbers 19:1)22). The ceremony has only been performed seve n times. The priest would sacrifice an unblemished, unbroken Red Heifer, afte r which the remaining ashes were collected and added to the ashes of the next sacrif ice. It took place on the western slope of the Mount of Olives, within sight of the H oly of Holies. The ashes were then sprinkled upon the waters of a large cistern under the Temple to prepare them to be used as the water of purification to cleanse sin an d defilement. The last sacrifice occurred in 70 AD, prior to the destruction of the Temple, after which the ashes were secretly buried. This ritual cleansing would have t o be performed on the Temple Mount in order to reinstate Temple worship as commanded b y the Laws of God. Originally kept in a containment building near the Eastern Gate, archaeological excavations have been initiated to find the ashes, which according to the ‘Copper Scroll’ found at Qumran, were buried in a container made of clay, and dung from the Red Heifer.

Copper Scroll  Vendyl Jones Vendyl Jones, a former Baptist minister turned arch aeologist in 1977, said to be the inspiration for the creation of the fictional movie character Indiana Jones (though producers Steven Spielberg and George Lucas deny it ), while searching in Jericho area caves for the Ark of the Covenant, found a clay jar containing a unique incense oil which dated back to the time of the second Jewish Temple, and contained the five ingredients the Bible identified as being part of the oil used to anoint kings. One of these ingredients was an oil called afars’mon, which was taken from t he sap of the rare balsam tree that grew near Jericho at a wadi known as Ein Gedi, near the area of Qumran. The oil was very rare, and when Rome invaded the Qumran communi ty before 70 AD, the Essenes burned the only known grove of these balsam trees, which are now considered extinct. This special anointing oil is listed in the Copper Scroll, and in 1988, using the clues given there, a worker, Benny Ayers, who was with a group of Christian archaeologists and volunteers (including Dr. Gary Collett and Dr. Nathan Meyers), under the direction of Dr. Joseph Patrich from the Hebrew University’s Institute of Archaeology, found an ancient clay container wrapped in palm leaves, in a hole three feet deep, on the floor of a cave adjacent to the one where Vendyl Jones would later discover some incense. Professor Ze’ev Aizenshtat and Dorit Aschengrau at the laboratory of Hebrew University’s Casali Institute of Applied Chemistry, used Carbon)14 dating and said that the oil was put in the container during the first c entury, and is believed to be the anointing oil that was used in the Temple.

There has been much speculation about what this treasure coul d have been. Some talk had centered around the Holy Grail. The G rail was believed to be a chalice made of gold, which was first used by Melch izedek as he offered bread and wine to Abraham on Mount Moriah. It was guarded in a Phoenician temple in Tyre, the city of Hiram, the king who designed and built Solo mon’s Temple. It fell into the hands of the Queen of Sheba, who gave it to King Solomon, and it was last used by Jesus and the disciples during the Last Supper. Other traditi ons have said that it was used by Mary Magdalene or Joseph of Arimathea to catch the blood of Jesus as it dripped off of His body while He hung on the cross. It was believed th at Joseph took the cup to Glastonbury in England; while others claim that Mar y took it with her to Marseilles in France. The Cathars, who descended from the Bogomils in Bul garia, and existed around the 10th and the 11th centuries, were perceived to be a wealthy people, and were said to possess a treasure beyond material wealth. In Janua ry, 1244, three months before the fall of their fortress in Montsegur, two men got ou t with the gold, silver, and money. As their defeat seemed eminent, the northern invaders served them with terms of surrender in March, and gave the Cathars two weeks to make a decision. One of the terms of this ‘cease)fire,’ was that if anyone tried to escape, t hey would be killed. A day before the surrender, when they would have been released, four men escaped on a rope, down the sheer western face of the fortress. According t o legend, the risk was made to protect their treasure. But if all their gold and silver ha d been smuggled out three months before, what did they risk their lives to protect. Was it the Holy Grail? The Knights of King Arthur’s Round Table searched f or the Grail, and legend has it that three of them seen it– Galahad, Percival, and Bors. Later stories revealed that the Grail was kept at the Church of St. Mary Magdalene in Rennes)le)Chateau, which is where she made her home. Others believe that the treasure Sauniere found may have been the Temple treasure. In 70 AD when Rome ransacked Jerusalem, c arrying its treasure back to Rome, it was believed that they may have gotten all of the Temple wealth, including the Ark of the Covenant. In 410, when the Visigoths inv aded Rome, they carried away, “the treasures of Solomon, the King of the Hebrews, a si ght most worthy to be seen, for they were adorned in the most part with emerald’s and in the olden time they had been taken from Jerusalem by the Romans.” Or, could the treasure discovered by Sauniere been the treasure plundered from the Temple grounds by the Knights Templar. Many of the Crusaders who went to Palestine to figh t against the Moslem invaders were French Catholics, and by 1061, they had conque red Jerusalem, and put Godfroi de Bouillon (1061)1100), Duke of Lower Lorraine, on the throne of Jerusalem. Known as the ‘Guardian of the Holy Sepulcher,’ he claimed to be of the lineage of David, and between 1090 and 1099, organized a secret society c alled the Prieuré de Sion (Order of Sion). His aims were to possess the wealth of the w orld, including the Temple treasure, and to establish world government which would be co ntrolled by a Merovingian king in Jerusalem.

It was Godfroi’s younger brother, Baudouin I, who became the first king of Jerusalem; it was the Prieuré de Sion that created the Knights Templar as its military arm.

They also t ook vows of chastity and poverty, and promised not to join any other organization. They p ledged to “keep the roads and highways safe ... for the protection of pilgrims” a nd not to surrender any wall, or foot of land. They offered their services to Baudouin I, th e King of Jerusalem, and an entire wing of the royal palace on the Temple Mount (the s ite of Solomon’s Temple) was given to them to be used as a living quarters. In 1139, P ope Innocent II decreed that these Knights of Christ owed their allegiance to no one b ut the Pope (thus becoming a military arm of the Catholic Church), and they began to wear white robes with a red cross on the front. They carried a black and white striped banne r which displayed the cross, and the words: “Non nobis, Domine, sed nomini tuo da gloria m,” which became their battle cry. Their meetings were carried out in secret. It is known, that for nine years, the Knights were searching for something beneath the Temple grounds, and evidence points to the fact that they might have found something. In March, 1952, a copper scroll found in cave III at Qumran, near the Dead Sea, revealed that more than 138 tons of gold and s ilver were buried in 64 locations, before the Romans destroyed the Temple.

When King Philip’s men broke int o the Templar castle in Paris, they discovered a silver bust of a woman’s head, with a hinged top, which when opened, contained two head bones wrapped in a white cloth, with a red cloth around that. They were believed to be part of the skeletal remains of Mary Magdalene. "},{"pageNumber":826,"pageContent":" Clement V It was revealed, that part of the initiation, requi red the initiate to deny, curse, and spit at the cross, as part of a gesture symbolizing St. Peter’s denial of Christ, thus introducing the candidate to the Order as a sinner, so they could teach him the ways of Christianity. In actuality, the Knights had actuall y become opposed to the Pope, when they realized the Vatican’s pagan relationship to s un worship; and since the Catholic Church had become so identified with St. Peter, the Knights had renounced Peter, and became followers of John. In 1312, Pope Clement ordered that the Knights Temp lar were to be suppressed. On March 18, 1314, Jacques de Molay, the 22nd Grand Master of the Knig hts, Geoffrey de Charney (who possessed the Shroud of Turin, which w as stolen from Constantinople), and two of their highest officers were burned at th e stake for trying to overthrow the government. In England, Edward II joined in the den unciation by arresting and torturing 140 knights, 54 of whom were burned at the stake. Edward II Some of the remaining Templars fled to Portugal, wh ere there were protected by King Dinis II. Most however took refuge in Scotland , where they stayed for 400 years, developing the Scottish Rite branch of Masonry. In England, where the Templars established the first modern Masonic lodge at York, it was identified as the York Rite; while in France, it became known as the Scottish Ri te. To signify the accomplishments of the Order, it was made the highest attainable de gree in Masonry. It is said that “every true Mason is a Knight Templar...”"},{"pageNumber":827,"pageContent":"Meanwhile, the Prieuré de Sion existed for another 300 years, until 1619, when the historical record dried up. According to recent information, it is believed tha t Sauniere’s ‘treasure’ was actually the knowledge gleaned from the parchments, that the crucifixion of Jesus was a set)up, and that He was alive as of 45 AD. Sauniere’s niece , Madame James of Montazels, inherited the parchments in 1917, and kept them unt il 1965 when she sold them to Capt. Roland Stanmore and Sir Thomas Frazier, who k eep them in a safe deposit box in Lloyds Bank Europe Limited of London. Only two o f the parchments have been released, the contents of the other two have not be en revealed. In the original sources concerning the Holy Grail, references are not to a cup, but to a mystery. In the 1180’s, “Le Roman de Perceval” (or “Le Conte du Graal”), a poem by Chretien de Troyes, chronicles one, Perceval, who seeks his knighthood. At the castle of the “Fisher King” he sees the Grail, which is golden an d is studded with jewels. It is not linked to Jesus. Perceval discovers that he is a me mber of the “Grail family” because the custodian of the Grail is his uncle. Chretian d ied before completing his work, and no copies exist. However, the story lived on, becoming closely aligned with King Arthur. “Roman de l ́Estoire dou Saint Graal” by Robert de B aron in the 1190’s was the version that Christianized the story, claiming that Joseph of Arimathea filled the cup with Christ’s blood, and that his family became the keep er of the Grail. Galahad was purported to be Joseph’s son, and the Grail was pas sed onto his brother)in)law, Brons, who took it with him to England, becoming the “Fish er King.” In this version, Perceval is the grandson. The most noted version is “Parzival,” which was wri tten between 1195 and 1216 by Wolfram von Eschenbach, a Bavarian Knight who claim ed that Chretien’s version was inaccurate because Wolfram received his information from a more reliable source. He said that the Grail is some sort of stone. But more important, is his preoccupation with the Grail family, the genealogy, or bloodline. In early stories, the Grail is called the Sangraal and Sangreal, which was divided to read ‘San Graal’ or ‘San Greal,’ when in fact, it s hould have read ‘Sang Raal’ or ‘Sang Real,’ meaning ‘Royal Blood.’ So therefore, the Gra il actually had more to do with blood, and not a cup which held blood. The “Queste del Saint Graal” written between 1215 a nd 1230, indicated that the Grail was brought to France by Mary Magdalene, and that the Grail story occurred about 456 years after the resurrection of Jesus, or about 487, which was about the time of the rise in Merovingian power. In 1964, according to the book The Jesus Scroll (1972) by Donovan Joyce, an ancient parchment scroll was excavated on the weste rn shore of the Dead Sea, at the ruins of the fortress of Masada. It was there that 965 Jewish men, women, and children, burned the complex, killed each other, and committe d suicide, rather than be captured by the Romans. The Jewish rebellion against Roman rule and their o ccupancy force came to a head in 66 AD when several thousand zealots stormed Masa da and seized King Herod’s fortress. From there, the movement spread, as loyal ists hoped to restore the throne of the Maccabean kings, which has been usurped a centu ry earlier. One part of the rebel army stayed at Masada, while the other marched on J erusalem. The attempt to"},{"pageNumber":828,"pageContent":"recapture the city failed, and the survivors retrea ted back to Masada. Rome struck back, and four years later, with nearly a million dead, a nd many enslaved, Jerusalem was firmly in their grasp, the Temple was destroyed, an d the entire country was overrun. The Roman Tenth Legion, under the command of Flavius Si lva, spent three years with a legion of 6,000 men, and 15,000 Jewish slaves, to b uild an assault tower in order to destroy the last vestiges of Jewish resistance at M asada. When the Roman soldiers breached the walls of the f ortress, they found only corpses, as the occupants preferred death to being captured and enslaved. In 1963, Masada was excavated by the Israeli Dept. of Antiquities in a massive archaeological operation led by Israeli scholar and soldier, Gen. Yigael Yadin. They discovered coins, tools, weapons, catapult ammuniti on, wine jars, beads, rings, buckles, jewelry, cosmetics, ovens, pots, pans, lamps, dishe s, baskets, and remnants of woven fabric clothing, as well as 14 parchment scrolls co ntaining Biblical text (Leviticus, Deuteronomy, Psalms, Ezekiel), the apocryphal Wisdo m of Ben)Sira, and Book of Jubilees, and a sectarian scroll which provided a l ink between the zealots and the Essenes of Qumran, 30 miles north of Masada.   Yi gael Yadin  Masad a "},{"pageNumber":829,"pageContent":" Another view of Masada from the other side In a cave on the upper face of the southern)most cl iff below the plateau, reached by descending to it with a rope, 25 skeletons were fou nd: 14 males, ages 22)60; a man between 70 and 80; six females between 15)22; four children from 8)12; and a fetus. It had been believed that all of the bodies had been t hrown over the side; so either the Roman centurions were unaware of this group which w ere separated from the main complex, or they were allowed to remain where they had fallen, just as the three skeletons found in Herod’s palace at the northern e nd of the complex, which were believed to be that of Eleazar ben Yáir, the Jewish commander, his wife and child, and left there as a tribute to his valor. The three wer e formally buried in July, 1969, at the foot of Masada in a common grave, with full militar y honors. It seems likely that there was an easier access to the cave, back at that time, which had since eroded away, the face of which was clearl y visible from at least two nearby camps, so it had to have been searched. Which means Silva may have known that this was a special group, and also left them untouched. If the purpose of the rebel’s presence at Masada wa s to restore the Hasmonean throne, then why did the war continue another six y ears after the death of their leader Mennahem at the battle in Jerusalem. The prevailin g evidence suggested that there was someone at Masada more senior than either Eleaz ar or Mennahem. Because of the discovery of this document, it is now believed that the Zealots on Masada were actually a bodyguard contingent for the Hasmonean R oyal Family, headed by Jesus, their king and Messiah, who they swore to defend ti ll the death. Another document which was discovered, had been wri tten on the evening of April 15, 73 AD, just after the Roman battering ram had c ompromised the fortress gate, and was pulled back, to await the Roman attack which wo uld come at first light. The document was signed by Yeshua ben Yákob ben Gennesa reth, who described himself as a “son of eighty years” (this would have placed his birth at 7 BC) and the last heir of"},{"pageNumber":830,"pageContent":"the Hasmonean (Maccabean) King of Israel. Translate d, the name was ‘Jesus of Gennesareth, son of Jacob.’ This document was the 1 5th parchment to be discovered on Masada, and it is believed that it was smuggled out of Israel by a rogue archaeologist, and taken to Russia. Because it can not be located, the details given about it were only hearsay. The contents were alleg edly revealed to the Vatican in February, 1967, because after a meeting between Pod gorny of the U.S.R.R. and Pope Paul, the Vatican did an about face, and began supp orting the Moslems in their quest for a homeland in Palestine. Let me interject, that Yadin, in his book Masada: Herod’s Fortress and the Zealots’ Last Stand says of the 25 bodies, that the “only feasible ass umption is that they were flung here irreverently by the Roman troops when th ey cleared the bodies after their victory.” Plus, he never mentions the discovery of a 15th scroll. So, how could the veracity of this story even be co nsidered? There is a developing trend that purports that Jesus was not the product of a virgin birth, that He was a normal man with a messianic complex, who was part of a con spiracy to fake his own death in order to fulfill Old Testament prophecy. It is beli eved that the Last Supper was actually a meeting to plan a way for Jesus to cheat death. Dr. Hugh J. Schonfield, in his book The Passover Plot (1965), theorized that the vinegar)soaked sponge given to Jesus during the cru cifixion, actually contained a drug that made Jesus appear as though He were dead, when he really wasn’t. This insured the prophetic fulfillment that his legs would not b e broken (which was done to bring death quicker). Joseph of Arimathea (a member of th e Sanhedrin) then went to Pilate to ask for permission to claim the body, so that it co uld be interred in a tomb owned by Joseph. Pilate sent a centurion to confirm that Jes us was dead. When Joseph asked for the body, he referred to it as ‘soma,’ (living); wh ile Pilate referred to the body as ‘ptoma’ (dead). To substantiate these facts, it is pointed out that the place of the crucifixion had to be near the tomb. While the other gospels state that H e was crucified at Golgotha, “the place of the skull,” John 19:41 says that he was cr ucified in a garden, where a new sepulcher had been hewn by Joseph. This garden was actually ‘Golgeth,’ the ‘wheel press,’ where olives were pressed into oil, which w as the Garden of Gethsemane. Some have even theorized that Joseph was actually the fo rmer husband of Mary, who had left Nazareth, and established himself at Jerusalem. Aft er the story about Jesus in the Temple, Joseph is not mentioned again. The ‘angels’ seen at the tomb were said to be Essene physicians who were sent to revive Jesus, th us creating the illusion of a resurrection. The apocryphal Gospel of Peter, discovered in an up per Nile valley in 1886, had existed as early as 180 AD, and reveals that Joseph of Arimathea was a friend of Pontius Pilate, and that Jesus was buried in the “g arden of Joseph.” Basilides, an Alexandrian scholar, who wrote various commentaries on the Gospels between 120 and 130 AD, believed that Jesus did not die on the cros s. In December, 1945, an Egyptian peasant discovered a pot near the village of Nag Ha mmadi in northern Egypt, which contained 13 scrolls, which consisted of copies of Biblical texts, which dated to about 400 AD, and were based on writings that were no old er than 150 AD, and provides a good historical reference because they were not alt ered by the Roman Catholic Church. In one, the Second Treatise of the Great Seth, it t alks about Jesus escaping His"},{"pageNumber":831,"pageContent":"death on the cross through substitution, who was id entified as Simon of Cyrene. An ancient document, found in the 4th century, in the library of a building used by Greek monks, said that Nicodemus and Joseph conspired to retrieve the body of Jesus so that it could be revived by Essene physicians. A document found in the 19th century by a member of the Societe Francaise Commerciale in Abyssinia, in the library of an old building formerly occupied by Greek monks, said that Jesus was born in Nazareth, was an Essene, and that after the crucifixion, Nicodemus told Joseph that he was goin g to resuscitate Jesus, but that John was not to know it. Inside the tomb, using Essene m edical knowledge, stimulative substances were burned, and strips of ointment)cove red linen were applied to the body. After the treatment, the stone put over the tomb op ening held the vapors in. Three days later, an Essene brother, in festive garments, went to the tomb, and the soldiers, thinking him to be an angel, ran away. Then 24 Esse nes showed up, and spirited Jesus away to their commune. However, Jesus insisted on l eaving and went to his disciples, and they believed him to have risen from the dead. A document known as The Crucifixion by an Eye Witness , was a Latin manuscript in the possession of a Masonic library in Germany, whi ch surfaced near the end of the 1800’s, and was said to have been copied from a let ter written by a member of the Essene Order, to another in Alexandria, only seven years after the crucifixion. It revealed that Jesus was the son of Mary and an Esse ne teacher who was not identified. It talked about the crucifixion, Jesus’ removal fro m the cross, and the Essene medical intervention which enabled him to survive the cruci fixion; and by appearing to His disciples afterwards, made it seem as though He had risen from the dead. It was first published in 1873, but was withdrawn from circulati on, its plates destroyed, as well as most copies. One copy did find its way into the pos session of a Mason in Massachusetts, and in 1907, it was republished in C hicago. The letter says of the birth of Jesus: “I will tell you of the parentage of this man, who loved all men and for whom we feel the highest esteem. He was from his infancy br ought up for our brotherhood. Indeed, he was predicted by an Essene, whom the wom an thought to be an angel. This woman was given to many imaginings, del ving into the supernatural and into the mysteries of life. Our brother the Ess ene has acknowledged his part in these things and has persuaded the brotherhood t o search for and protect the child secretly.” “Joseph, who was a man of great experience is life and of deep devotion to the immortal truth, was influenced, through a messenger of our Order, not to leave the woman nor disturb her faith in the sacredness o f her experience. He was told to be a father to the child until our brotherhood s hould admit him as a novice. Thus, during their flight to Egypt, Joseph, his wif e and the child were secretly protected and guided by our brotherhood.” Apocryphal writings indicate that while in Egypt, J oseph and Mary stayed at the monasteries of Wadi)el)Natrun, Mataria, and al)Moha rraq, which were run by the Essenes."},{"pageNumber":832,"pageContent":"According to Josephus, the Essenes were “the most p erfect of all sects in Palestine.” He wrote that “they despise riches and worldly gain s and live in communes,” and “are the most honest people in the world C exercise just ice and equality C never marry, and they keep no servants. They all live the same simpl e, industrious and frugal life.” He described them as a secret brotherhood that were ag ainst the Pharisees and Sadducees, abhorred violence, wore white robes, wer e vegetarians, did not believe in animal sacrifice, studied the healing properties of herbs, possessed a high moral standard, and observed celibacy. In 1963, scrolls known as the Talmud of Jmmanuel, w ere discovered by Greek Catholic priest, Isa Rashid, in a cave he claimed w as the burial cave of Jesus. Written in old Aramaic, sealed in protective resin, and buried under a flat rock, it is believed to have been written by Judas Iscariot. Pieces of the scrolls were missing, some unreadable, some deteriorating, yet, what had survi ved, was completely contrary to the story of Jesus as related in the Bible. The document claims that Joseph of Arimathea realiz ed that Jesus was still alive, and quickly went to Pilate to request the body, tak ing it back to his own tomb. There was a secret second entrance, and it was through he re that his friends were able to bring the herbs and salves necessary to provide med ical treatment. In three days he was strong enough to walk. After a few appearances to his disciples, he went to Syria, then to India, and the area now known as West Pakis tan, Afghanistan, and the Himalayas, where he continued to teach. He married and had children, and it was believed that he died at the age of, between 110)11 5 years old, in Anzimar in Khanyar Srinagar, which is located in Kashmir, India. These scrolls were in the possession of his first born son, who returned to Jerusalem, and hid them in the burial cave of Joseph of Arimathea where Jesus had been taken. The ‘sacred tomb in Kashmir’ is the burial site of a man known as Yazu Asaph (also written as Yuz Asaf), who was known as a prophet. H e came to this valley about 2000 years ago from Egypt, teaching the same things as J esus. Located in a small, rectangular brick and wood structure, he is buried in a wooden sepulcher which contains an inner wooden sarcophagus that is covere d with a sacred shroud, and a rectangular stone slab. The structure seems to be built over an ancient sto ne structure which actually contains the remains of Asaph. A tiny opening allow s you to see into the crypt below the floor, and into the burial chamber. Inside the shrine is a smaller tombstone, which is that of an Islamic saint Syed Nasir) ud Din, who was buried there in the 15th century. B oth tombstones are aligned north)to) south, following Islamic custom, but the sarcophagu s in the crypt below containing Asaph’s remains are aligned east)to)west, which is a Jewish custom. Chiseled on a stone slab are the impressions of his two feet which bear the traces of crucifixion wounds, conceivably of the man who is b uried there. The nature of the wounds indicate that the man was crucified with the left foot over the right, with one nail going through both feet– which matches the pattern of the figure on the Shroud of Turin, which is purported to be the burial cloth of Jesus. It is also believed that Mary, the mother of Jesus, accompanied Jesus and Mary Magdalene to India. She died when she was 70 years old, trying to escape when the Kushans attacked the region of Taxila. The place sh e was buried in Pakistan (45 miles"},{"pageNumber":833,"pageContent":"east of Taxila) was called ‘Mari’ until 1875, when the spelling was changed to ‘Murree.’ The tomb is called ‘Mai)Mari)de)Asthan’ or ‘resting place of mother Mary.’ No other tombs in the world are purported to be that of Mary . Mary Magdalene is reported to have died at Kashgar, in central Asia, and it was a ctually Martha, that took her son, along with some other followers of Jesus, to France , where she lived till her death. Then came the story of St. Hazrat Issa. Around 1887 , Nicolas Notovitch, a Russian journalist, while traveling in Ladakh in Tibet, had fallen from his horse and broke his right leg, below the knee, and was taken to the mon astery at Hemis (Himis), 25 miles from Leh, the capital of Ladakh (400 miles north of Delhi), located in a hidden valley of the Himalayas, some 11,000 feet above sea level. T here, the chief lama read him the story of Issa, the man he knew as Jesus, which said that during the 17 years in which he is not mentioned in the scriptures, Jesus was in India. Nicolas Notovitch He was told that they had many scrolls describing t he “life and acts of the Buddha Issa, who preached the holy doctrine in India and a mong the children of Israel.” He visited the monastery at Mulbekh, and was told that at the archives at Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, there were several thousand ancient scrol ls detailing the life of Issa, and that some of the principal monasteries also had copies. The documents, which had been brought from India, t o Nepal, and then to Tibet, were originally written in Pali, the religious lang uage of the Buddhists, and then translated into Tibetan. Notovitch believed that th e verses “may have been actually been spoken by St. Thomas– historical sketches trac ed by his own hand or under his direction.” There are various references to the apostle Thomas (also known as Didymus, Judas, and “twin brother of Christ, apostle of the Highest who shares in the knowledge of the hidden words of ChristC”), who, according to religious tradition, introduced Christianity to India in 52 AD. The apocryphal Acta Thomae ( The Acts of St. Thomas ) written in the early 3rd century, said: “When the Apostles had been for a ti me in Jerusalem, they divided the countries among them in order that each might preac h in the region which fell to him; and India (Parthia, northwest region of India, from the Euphrates to Indus and India proper), fell to the lot of Thomas.” He went to Ind ia as a carpenter, and preached the gospel to the Parthians, Medes, Persians, Bactrians , Indians, and Hyrecaneans."},{"pageNumber":834,"pageContent":"One story said that he arrived at the coast of Mala bar in 52, and established his first church there. Another story said that after spendin g some time in the North, he went south, along the coast of the Arabian Sea. And yet another story said he arrived in the state of Kerala in 52, where it is believed that Th omas established seven churches: Cranganore, Palur, Kottakavu, Kokkamangalam, Niram, Chayal, and Quilon. After a couple years he went to South Tamil, and Tamil Najd . According to a 2nd century Syrian manuscript called The Doctrine of the Apostles , it says: “After the death of the Apostles, there were Guides and Rulers in the Churches; and whatever the Apostles communicated to them, and they had received from them, they taught to the multitudes. They, again, a t their deaths also committed and delivered to their disciples after them everyth ing which they had received from the Apostles; also what James had written from Jerusalem and Simon from the City of Rome, and John from Ephesus and Mark fr om the great Alexandria, and Andrew from Phrygia and Luke from Macedonia and Thomas from India, that the epistles of an Apostle might be received and re ad in the churches in every place ... India and all its own countries and those bordering on it even to the farthest sea, received the Apostles’ Hand of Priest hood from Thomas, who was Guide and Ruler in the Church which he built there and ministered there.” His writings speak of the conversion of a king name d Gundaphar, and in the 19th century, some coins were discovered in Afghanistan, near the capital city of Kabul, and in the western and southern regions on the Indian P unjab, which bear the name Godophares, and date back to 20 and 40 AD. He went from the west coast to the east, to Mylapor e (near Madras in southern India, now called St. Thomas Mount), on the Bay of Bengal, where in 72, he was killed by an assassin sent by the ministers of the king, w hile he was kneeling in prayer. After being pierced by the spear, he fell on a hand)carve d stone cross. This cross was rediscovered by some Portuguese workers on March 22 , 1547, as they were digging the foundation for the church that was built on the sit e. His relics were preserved in a cathedral dedicated to him. The Roman Catholic Chur ch considers the Cathedral of St. Thomas a Basilica, because it was erected over his tomb. However, another source said he was buried six miles away at the church he built, near Fort St. George in Tamil Nadj in India. Notovich published his findings in New York in 1890 as The Life of Saint Issa , and in London in 1894, as The Unknown Life of Christ . He said that the Roman Catholic Church was aware of the existence of these manuscri pts, and in fact have 63 complete, or partial copies of similar manuscripts in various languages. Notovich was treated by Dr. Karl Marx (not the Russ ian Revolutionary), who recorded the information in his diary that is in th e possession of the Moravian Christian Mission at Leh. However, the New York Times published a story about J. Archibald Douglas who visited the same monastery, and they to ld him they never saw Notovich, and knew nothing of a Saint Issa. They labeled Noto vich’s book a forgery. In 1921, a tourist named Henrietta Merrick visited the monastery at Hemis, was told about Issa, and that there were documents that had been in their possession for 1500"},{"pageNumber":835,"pageContent":"years that talked about him. In 1922, Swami Abhedananda, a scholar, Hindu monk, and a disciple of Ramakrishna, went to India, visited the same monast ery at Hemis, and was also told about St. Issa from their copy of the scroll; and h e was shown an original copy of the scroll at the monastery in Lhasa, Tibet, which vind icated the incredible claims of Notovitch. He translated it into English, and then in 1929 to Bengali. In 1928, Professor Nikolai Roerich also traveled to Ladakh and Kashmir, where he visited the Hemis monastery, saw many scrolls, and found out that the writings concerning Issa were kept in the most isolated part of the subterranean storage areas. Nikolai Roerich Roerich said that the Tibetan scroll he found indic ated that Issa was 13 years old when he secretly left his father’s house left for I ndia, and Notovich records in his book that he was 14 when he went to India, as does the N atha Namavali (or Sutra). He didn’t want to marry, which pushed him into leaving home. He traveled east with a caravan of merchants to Pakistan. The apocryphal Gospel of the Hebrews (also known as the Gospel According to the Hebrews ) said that Jesus traveled to India by way of Assyr ia and Chaldea with a group of merchants. His first stop was Sindh, where the I ndus River and its tributaries flow into the Arabian Sea. He then went to Punjab and Rajputa na, and then to Orissa. The evidence suggested that Issa stayed at the Temple o f Jagannath in Puri for 6 years. He also visited Rajagriha, Varanasi (Benares) and othe r holy cities. Issa then left the temple so he could visit the bir thplace of Buddha, and lived in the Buddhist monastery there, where he was educated in the teachings of Buddha. Sakyamuni Buddha (563 ) 483 BC) was a well)educated prince who renounced his royalty (his father was the Chief of the Shakya Cla in in Kapilavastu, in Nepal), because of his disillusionment with the ravages of illness and old age. At Gaya, while meditating under a Bodhi tree, he had a vision, and became ‘en lightened.’ He taught about “non) violence, peace, and compassion.” About 300 years l ater, Ashoka Maurya (269)232 BC), emperor of northern India, converted to Buddhi sm, and sent missionaries to many countries. In fact, it has been suggested that the Pythagoreans in Greece, and Essene community in Judea, was the result of missionary wo rk by Buddhists. The man known"},{"pageNumber":836,"pageContent":"as Issa was considered to be the incarnate of the s pirit of Buddha, and was revered as a great prophet and teacher. After 6 years in the foothills of the Himalayas in southern Nepal, he was recognized as a Master, and “had become a perfect expositor of the sacred writings.” He left, traveling westward. He passed through Punjab, and m et up with a caravan of merchants from Kashmir, and he performed miracles a mong them, including the healing of the sick. He returned to Egypt where he appeared before the E ssene brotherhood, where he passed 7 tests, after which he was proclaimed the C hrist. In a meeting before the 7 ‘Sages’ Issa said: “The history of life is well condensed in these imm ortal postulates: ‘There are seven hills on which the holy city shall be built; there are seven sure foundation stones on which the universal church shall stand.’ The words I speak are not my own; they are the words of him whose will I do.” “And from men of low estate I will select twelve me n, who represent twelve immortal thoughts, and these will be the model of t he church. And when a better age shall come, the universal church will stand upo n the seven postulates. And in the name of God, our Father God, the kingdom of the soul shall be established on the seven hills. And all the peoples, tribes, an d tongues of the earth shall enter in. The prince of peace will take his seat up on the throne of power; the triune God will then be All in All.” He returned to Palestine when he was 29 years old, and the remainder of the narrative pretty much parallels the New Testament, except that the Jewish priests and elders are portrayed as supporting him, and Pilate is the one working behind the scenes to bring about his death. The text then ends with t he persecution of his followers, and the disciples being sent forth to preach. According to tradition, Issa died when he was 125 y ears old. In 367, Bishop Athanasius of Alexandria made a list of writings which were to become what we now know as the New Testament. His s elections were ratified by the Church Council of Hippo in 393, and again four year s later, by the Council of Carthage. Therefore certain ‘books’ were left out, and were ‘ lost’ even though some may have been historically accurate. One of the primary duti es of the Church fathers between the 7th and 12th centuries was to obtain manuscripts fr om collections in Eastern countries, which contained information that differed from the version accepted and taught by the Church. These original documents may still be in th e Vatican archives. The first mention of the resurrection of Jesus appe ars in 1 Corinthians 15:3) 8, because it is believed that this was actually writt en about ten years before Mark was written. Therefore the stories concerning the resur rection of Jesus were unknown to Paul. In 1 Corinthians 9:1, Paul says: “...have I n ot seen Jesus Christ our Lord?” yet there is no historical reference that he knew Jesus . The word “seen” was translated from the Greek word ‘ophthe,’ which means to have o ne’s eyes opened to realms beyond this physical world, which refers to visions . It is the same verb which is used by Isaiah (Isa. 6:1) when he said: “I saw the Lord sit ting upon a throne...” It was also used"},{"pageNumber":837,"pageContent":"in Luke 24:34 to say that Jesus “appeared to Simon” and in the Book of Acts to describe the resurrection. Paul never spoke of a physical re surrection, because in light of the proper translation, it was only in a spiritual resu rrection, where Jesus now “sitteth on the right hand of God.” (Col. 3:10) Nearly a hundred “gospels” appeared during the firs t three centuries, and to preserve continuity and protect the new Christian r eligion, the four gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John were chosen. Despite some gaps and contradictions, they were very similar. These books were not written during J esus’ lifetime, but date from a time of major revolution in Judea, 66)74 and 132)135, and t he earlier writings that they had been based upon have since been lost. The argument has been made, that though some apocry phal gospels are derived from some sects that are doctrinely different from Christianity, their appearance, some in the early 2nd century, suggest that they were cl oser to the actual events than the four gospels, and possibly more historically accurate. What all the writers of the Gospels had, concerning Jesus, was just an outline of the man. There were no eyewitnesses to consult, so wher e there was a void in detail, they just referred to the Hebrew Scriptures to fill in t he blanks. For example, the removal of Jesus to Egypt by His earthly father Joseph, hearke ns back to the patriarch Joseph in the Book of Genesis; the story about the young Jesu s in the Temple, was modeled after Samuel’s Temple experiences; the Sermon on the Moun t was an attempt to paint Him as another Moses; the story of Jesus’ raising of th e widow’s son at Nain, was taken from Elijah’s raising of the widow’s son in 1 Kings 17:17; Jesus’ feeding of the 5,000 was just a retelling of God’s providing for Moses’ people as they wondered in the wilderness; the story of Jesus walking on the water , was a misunderstanding of the Greek preposition which could mean ‘on’ or ‘alongsi de of’; and the ascension of Jesus was taken from the story of Elijah being taken up i nto Heaven. The earliest Gospel was considered to be Mark, whic h was compiled between 66)74 in Rome, and was believed to address a Greco)Roman readership, and if he wanted it to survive, he could not make it appear as though t he Romans were responsible for the death of Jesus. It actually ends without the discip les’ assertion that Jesus rose from the dead, and only says that the women were told that H e had risen. Mark never mentions whether He was ever seen after the crucifixion. In 1958, in a monastery near Jerusalem, Professor M orton Smith of Columbia University, discovered a letter that contained a mi ssing fragment of the Gospel of Mark, which through the years had been suppressed by Bish op Clement of Alexandria, who was informed that a gnostic sect known as the Carpo cratians were interpreting various passages in the Gospel of Mark for their own purpos es, which did not coincide with Church doctrine. The passage was part of the story about Lazarus being raised from the dead, and hinted that he wasn’t actually dead. Alon g with the exclusion, there was also an addition, because the original manuscript ended with the death and burial of Christ, and the discovery of an empty tomb. Yet, the versio n that exists today, includes the Resurrection, which was added in the 2nd century, m aking the last twelve verses of Mark fraudulent. However, research by Ivan Panin (o utlined in a booklet called The Last Twelve Verses of Mark ), utilizing analysis of numeric design, has done a lot to reaffirm its authenticity. "},{"pageNumber":838,"pageContent":" Morton Smith The gospels of Luke and Matthew used Mark as a sour ce for their writings. Luke (who also wrote the Book of Acts) dates to about 80 , and was composed for a Roman official at Caesarea, and therefore was not anti)Ro man. While Matthew’s genealogy of Jesus only goes back to Abraham, Luke’s goes back t o Adam. Where Mark mentions only an empty tomb, in Luke, the women actually go in and see for themselves that it is empty. They encounter not one, but two angelic bein gs. Luke goes more into depth regarding the subsequent physical appearances of Je sus. Matthew was put together about 85, and allegedly no t by the disciple Matthew. It was intended to be a revision of Mark, in order to put more emphasis on the divine nature of Jesus, and borrowed references from the B ook of Joshua who referred to placing guards at a cave in which he had five captu red kings imprisoned, and having the cave sealed with a huge stone. It also alluded to D aniel in the lion’s den, and how he came out alive, when he applied the story to Jesus in regard to him surviving the tomb. In Mark, Peter is quoted to have said to Jesus, “Th ou art the Christ,” and in Matthew, he is quoted to have said, “Thou art the Christ, the S on of the living God.” The disciples were told to baptize “in the name of the Father, an d of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost,” which it is alleged that Jesus could not have said, because it actually represented a theological premise that didn’t occur till much lat er. Barnabas, a follower of Jesus, uncle of Mark, and a companion of Paul, who traveled around Palestine preaching the good news, wrote an apocryphal book, known as the Gospel of Barnabas . It was accepted as a canonical gospel in the Alex andrian churches until 325 AD, when the Nicene Council orde red all copies of it to be destroyed, and anyone who had it in there possession was to be put to death. In the 5th century, a copy, written in his own hand , was found lying on his chest, in his tomb in Cyprus, which made its way into the lib rary of Pope Sixtus V (1585)1590) and was made available by a monk named Frater Marin o. Though there is no major deviation from the authori zed gospels, one subtle difference appeared in the Sermon on the Mount, whi ch seems to indicate that the account which in written in Matthew may have been e mbellished, to make it sound better. Barnabas writes: ““Blessed are they that mo urn this earthly life, for they shall be comforted. Blessed are the poor who truly hate the delights of the world, for they shall abound in the delights of the Kingdom of God. Bless ed are they that eat at the table of God, for the angels shall minister unto them.”"},{"pageNumber":839,"pageContent":"Polycarp, author of a letter to the Philippians, wr ote about the first three Gospels, but not the fourth, because it didn’t exist, and it was n’t mentioned until 180 by Theophilus of Antioch. John has come to be regarded as the most a ccurate of the Gospels, even though it is believed to have been written over a p eriod of years by theologians, at the Greek city of Ephesus, who in 100 AD, sought to fil l the void in the contents of the other three. John has the risen Jesus being seen by only Mary Magdalene, where in other books, other women accompanied her; and also single s her out as being a primary mourner. This hint at a more intimate relationship has given rise to a theory as to the actual role that Mary had in the life of Jesus. In the other three gospels, the Last Supper is portrayed as a Passover meal, after which Jesus was crucified; however in John, the crucifixion occurred before the Passover, whereby J ohn puts more emphasis on the foot washing that occurred. This discrepancy had been ex plained by saying that John was using the lunar calendar, while the others were usi ng the solar calendar, however, it is now believed that John’s purpose was to present Jes us as the Passover Lamb of the Jews, who is killed as their sacrifice. Where in Lu ke, only Peter goes to inspect the tomb; in John, it was Peter and John. Critics claim that the story of Doubting Thomas (John 20:19)31) wasn’t true, based on the premise t hat Jesus was tied to the cross, rather than nailed. Some have even claimed that the re was “no historical proof that he (John) ever existed.” Polycarp Simon Peter, the “Rock” upon whom Jesus said He wou ld build His church, was believed to be the first to ‘see’ Jesus after the r esurrection, and it was through his efforts that the philosophy of Christianity was perpetuated . The primary contention is that the New Testament was doctored to present Jesus as bein g divine. Because Jesus was not of the priestly tribe of the Levites, it was necess ary to validate His claims so that He would be accepted by the early Christians. In the B ook of Hebrews, completed before the fall of Rome around 68, Jesus was described as being a perfect priest after the order of Melchizedek, who in Genesis was referred t o as a priest of the most high God, yet neither was he a Levite. The Book of Hebrews, s aid to be written by Paul, also refers to the presence of Jesus in Heaven, but neve r refers to a physical resurrection.

In a 1977 book, called The Myth of God Incarnate , 7 scholars and professors from prominent American seminaries seriously questi oned whether Jesus was Lord, and said that the Bible should be updated by having all traces of the deity of Jesus removed. They said that Jesus didn’t claim to be di vine, but was promoted to that status by early Christians who were under pagan influences . Another book, The Five Gospels: What Did Jesus Really Say? , a report by 77 Biblical scholars, which were part of the Jesus Seminar, said that Jesus did not say about 80 % of the words which are attributed to him in the four gospels. They claim that the wor ds were inserted by Christians after His death. In October, 1994, the Seminar convened a nd decided that the virgin birth of Jesus was fabricated. One participant called it “th eological fiction.” This group began working on a new Bible commentary to reflect all of its findings. John Shelby Spong and his book questioning the Resu rrection of Christ The Gospel of John doesn’t mention the birth of Jes us, but it covers the conclusion of his ministry. The incident of the wedding at Can a is only mentioned in John, and is unusual in that the bride and groom are not identif ied, yet Jesus, His disciples, and His mother were there. When they ran out of wine, it wa s Jesus who performed the miracle of turning water into wine. The question was asked– why would Jesus use His divine powers for such an insignificant purpose– unless it was His own wedding. Researchers have analyzed John 2:9)10, and feel that where the head of the feast is speaking to the bridegroom, it is actually Jesus that he is address ing. It is argued that this marriage was Jesus being married to Mary Magdalene, who it is be lieved was the woman whom Jesus cast the demons out of, who washed and anoint ed the feet of Jesus, and who is"},{"pageNumber":841,"pageContent":"identified as Mary of Bethany (sister of Lazarus an d Martha). She figures heavily in the gospels, and it was to her that Jesus first reveale d Himself after the Resurrection. Since the Essene law forbade marriage, Jesus may ha ve been forced to withdraw from his relationship with her, because it would in terfere with His work. The Gospel of the Ebionites (‘ebionim’ Hebrew for ‘the humble’ or ‘poor’ were purists that believed only the poor could receive Salvation , observed the Law of Moses, and considered Jesus to only be a prophet) or Gospel of the Hebrews , supposedly shed so much light on Jesus, that it was suppressed by Chur ch leaders. In fact, all books of the Ebionite sect have mysteriously disappeared. In the Gospel of Mary , Peter says: “Sister, we know that the Saviour loved you more than the re st of women. Tell us the words of the Saviour which you remember– which you know but we do not, nor have we heard them.” The apocryphal Gospel of Philip refers to Mary as his “spouse,” and says: “There were three who always walked with the Lord; Mary hi s mother and her sister (Salome) and Magdalen, the one who is called His companion ( partner) ... the spouse (companion) of the Saviour is Mary Magdalen ... (He ) loved her more than all the disciples and used to kiss her often on the mouth.” Near the end of the book, it says: “There is the Son of Man and there is the son of th e Son of Man. The Lord is the Son of Man, and the son of the Son of Man is he who is cre ated through the Son of Man.” It was Mary Magdalene, who carried the Grail, Sangraal , or ‘Royal Blood’ to France. Around 70 AD, Mary, the wife of Jesus, took his chi ldren, and fled the Holy Land to escape the Roman destruction of Jerusalem. They mad e their way to a Jewish community in Provence, in southern France, where th e lineage of Jesus, through marriage, was joined with the royal family of the F ranks (during the 5th century, the Sicambrians, a Germanic tribe called the Franks, cr ossed the Rhine River into Gaul into what is now Belgium and northern France), thus crea ting the royal Merovingian dynasty. Within the Merovingian royal family, there were man y Judaic names. It is believed that she later died at Saint Baume. It could be that the Holy Grail, ‘Sang Raal,’ or ‘R oyal Blood,’ could actually represent the womb of Mary Magdalene, which produced the bloo dline. It is even conjectured that French cathedrals like Notre Dame, were built in ho nor of Mary Magdalene, and not the mother of Jesus. In 2003, according to a novel by Dan Brown called The Da Vinci Code , the Prieuré de Sion deliberately manipulated the record of Mary ’s role in the life of Jesus to spare her family from Roman Catholic leaders who sought t o maintain the Biblical depiction. They used a code and symbols to represent and prese rve her story, which evolved into the Holy Grail. In a ABC television documentary exp loring the possibility of Jesus being married, Brown uses Da Vinci’s (a Prieuré de Sion m ember) painting of The Last Supper (c. 1495) as an example. A close examination of the figure on Jesus’ right, long believed to be John, actually looks like a woman, a nd he believes that it is actually a representation of Mary.

There is a legend that during one of his tri ps to Britain, Jesus was with him, and they stayed at a small house at Glastonbury. St. Au gustine later wrote to Pope Gregory that Jesus had established a church there. Gildas ( 516)570), an early British historian, said that “Jesus afforded His light to this island during the height of the reign of Tiberius (who ruled 14)37 AD, with the ‘height’ being around 25)27).” It is explained that Jesus may have possibly been i n the area to learn about the Druids. It is a long)held tradition that after the crucifixion, around 37 AD, Joseph led a group of people who settled in Glastonbury; and a w attle church was built on what became the location of the Abbey, which existed unt il the 1100’s. It is from this group which came the Culdees (quidam advanae) or Christia nized Druids, who lived on the islands off the west coast of Britain. Merovee was the first king of the Merovingian blood line, and he is surrounded in legend. He was said to have been fathered by two. W hen his mother was already pregnant by King Clodio, she went swimming in the o cean, where she was raped by a sea creature “similar to a Quinotaur,” so that when Merovee was born, the blood that coursed through his veins was a combination of both , which gave him superhuman powers. Merovee claimed he descended from Odin, a N orse God (which is where we get Wednesday, Woden’s Day, or Odin’s Day), which s ome researchers believe actually referred to Dan, one of the twelve tribes of Israel , because the Merovingian kings claimed to be the descendants of the Spartans and T rojans. The tribe of Dan declined to accept their land when Joshua divided it up, and they marched up the Jordan valley to the city of Laish, conquered it, and called it the city of Dan. They immigrated to what is now known as Greece , where they dominated the people who were living there, the Pelasgians. They became known as the Danaoi. They established the settlement of Ionia on the Ionian I sles. A branch migrated to Ireland and"},{"pageNumber":845,"pageContent":"were known as the “Tuatha de Danaan,” then went to Denmark as the Danes, and another branch eventually made their way to Britain . The Celts claim they came from the tribe of Dan, and that the name Denmark, and th e Danube River, give evidence of their migration. The Spartans lived in the southern Greek peninsula of Arcadia, later migrating across the Aegean Sea to build the city of Troy. Ac cording to the Iliad, by the Greek poet Homer, the founder of Troy was Dar)dan)us. Ove r the centuries the Spartans made their way into southern France, while the Troj ans moved north and west into Germany, Belgium and northern France, following the Danube River, eventually settling in the province of Lorraine. In the apocryphal book of 1 Maccabees, it was written that the Spartans were related to the Jews and were of t he stock of Abraham, and for various reasons, were believed to have been from th e tribe of Dan. When the tomb of Childeric I, son of Merovee, was o pened in 1653, 300 miniature bees of gold were found, which Napoleon had sewn in to his coronation robe. In the Bible, the Danites were represented by a serpent, a n eagle, a lion, and bees. The eagle’s wings on the back of the lion in the 7th ch apter of Dan may symbolize Dan breaking away from the tribe of Judah. The tribe of Dan lived in the territory west of Jerusalem, near the coast of the Mediterranean, and after the death of Samson, lost their lands, and went north into the area now known as Lebanon, where they lived for 600 years. In 721 BC, when the Assyrians took ten o f the tribes captive, there was no mention of Dan, thus they soon lost their identity. In Genesis 49:17, Jacob gave a prophetic statement in regard to his sons in that “last days,” and said that, “Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that biteth the horse heels, so that his rider shall fal l backward.” In the Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs , an apocryphal book written about 150 BC, which is said to represent the final words of Jacob’s twelve sons to their fam ilies, attributes this statement to Dan, made when he was 125 years old: “I read in the Book of Enoch, the Righteous, that your prince is Satan ... I know that in the last da ys you will defect from the Lord, you will be offended at Levi, and revolt against Judah (the bloodline of Jesus), but you will not prevail over them.” When Moses built the Tabernacle, he chose two men t o head up the project, Bezaleel, of the tribe of Judah, and Aholiab of the tribe of Dan; and after it was completed, the tribes were positioned around it, an d instructed to display their standard. Dan was in the north, and given the symbol of Scorp io, which according to the Egyptian Zodiac was a snake; and yet, Ahiezer, captain of th e tribe, chose an eagle, considered a hunter of snakes. The symbol of ancient Spartan G reece was an eagle, as was the symbol of ancient Trojan Rome. In recent history, t he symbol of the Hapsburg dynasty was an eagle. The offspring of Merovee were noted for a birthmark , a small red cross, above their heart or between their shoulder blades, which becam e their symbol. The Merovingians were known as sorcerer)kings, who could heal, had c lairvoyant powers, and could telepathically communicate with animals. They wore powerful amulets, and were called the ‘long)haired Kings’ because they didn’t cut the ir hair. Merovee (447)58) was a practitioner of the religious cult of Diana. His so n, Childeric I (458)96) practiced witchcraft.

However, they continued to work for a United Europe as a protection against the Soviets, and as a neutr al power to serve as a balance between Russia and the United States.

With this type of research, which purports to give you ‘evidence’ of their claims, it can be rather unsettling. All of these theories and revelations seem so incredible, that they border on the impossible, because they are com pletely contrary to everything we have been taught to believe. The arguments are so s trong and persuasive, but one thing you must always remember about what is going on, is that it is a Satanic conspiracy– planned from the very beginning. With t hat said, bear in mind what it says in John 8:44– “Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh o f his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.” The three main things that Satan doe s, is that he kills, steals, and destroys; so if any new information seeks to deviate from wha t is found in the Word of God, then it must be considered highly suspect. You must use spi ritual discernment to separate fact from Satanic lies and deceit. When I found out about the Prieuré de Sion there se emed to be something here, but"},{"pageNumber":853,"pageContent":"for the longest time I just couldn’t put my finger on it. But soon, the deeper I got, certain things stood out. By approaching these theories as being untruths, which they are; and isolating certain aspects of the premise, I think t hat the Prieuré de Sion becomes an important piece of the puzzle which I have been try ing to assemble. My theological beliefs are based on the fact that J esus Christ was, and is the Messiah, the son of God; that He was crucified, and died on the cross for the sins of the world; and that after three days, He rose from the dead, and commissioned His disciples to preach the gospel to all people. I was raised to believe that, and as I have gotten older, it continues to be an undeniable fact . Since I consider this to be the truth, there must be a reason why people would go to such lengths to disprove the resurrection of Jesus, and develop a fraudulent bac kground story. There seems to be a poison that is slowly spreading in Religion. For years, the story has been building that Jesus planned the crucifixio n to fake his death in order to fulfill Old Testament prophecies. This basically says that the concept of Christianity is based on a lie, and that Christ was only a man, who was t ransformed into the Son of God by early Church leaders. There weren’t that many peopl e that held to this belief. However, with knowledge gleaned from archaeological excavati ons, the discovery and translation of new apocryphal and biblical texts, and new inter pretations of Scripture, the liberals have been successful in spreading this propaganda. Even though Jesus has been accepted as a great man, a great teacher, and credi ted for the establishment of the largest religious group in the world, this movement has sought to strip away his divinity by saying that the Resurrection was concocted to dr aw people into the Church. When the revelation of the Prieuré de Sion began to surface amidst talk that not only was the Crucifixion planned, but that Jesus was mar ried to Mary Magdalene, and had children whose descendants became part of the Merov ingian Royal Family– there had to be a reason. Although not a lot is known about t his group, there seems to be evidence that they may have found much of the Templ e treasure, and used this wealth to establish themselves as a financial power in the world. The Merovingians ruled in Europe, and the Prieuré de Sion has been working be hind the scenes to unite Europe under a single form of government. With the advent of the European Union, their efforts have been realized. Their goal has been to establis h a World Government that would be ruled by the Merovingian bloodline. After all these years, why does this group continue to work towards this goal? The implication has been made that the group represents the Merovingian bloodline, and by extension, are the li ving descendants of Jesus Christ. Biblical references in Daniel and Revelation strong ly suggest the rise of a future leader out of the reestablished Holy Roman Empire, which is actually Europe. This leader will have to be a man capable of gaining the political support of all the European states. He will be a military genius who will be ab le to give Europe a sense of security, and a brilliant statesman whose words and deeds wil l make him a champion of justice. He will understand the problems of Europe, who will be able to bring peace and prosperity to the land. As time goes on, and more propaganda is spread conc erning this bloodline of Jesus, more people will begin to believe it. Remember what Joseph Goebbels (1897)1945, Nazi Minister of Propaganda) said: “The great masse s of people will more easily fall victims to a ‘big lie’ than a small one, if it is r epeated often enough.” And remember, only two of the four documents discovered by Saunie re have been revealed; plus, it is"},{"pageNumber":854,"pageContent":"believed that the Prieuré de Sion is also in posses sion of documentation that will prove their contention.

Some of you have probably heard of the British)Isra el theory in regard to the migrations of the Jews. Proponents of this theory c laim that those populating the country of Israel now are not actually Jews, that t he Jewish race actually migrated west to the area of Europe and became the progenitors of the European nations. The patriarch Jacob produced twelve sons, each of w hom became the father of one of the tribes of Israel: Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Juda h, Issachar, Zebulun, Joseph, Benjamin, Dan, Naphtali, Gad, and Asher. They each settled in a different part of the land of Canaan on each side of the Jordan River. Af ter the death of King Solomon, Israel was split into two Kingdoms, along territori al and political lines. Judah and Benjamin in the South remained loyal to the House o f David; while the rest of the tribes to the North were ruled by a succession of monarchi es. The Assyrian conquest of Israel mentioned earlier w as a bit more complex than what is generally known. The downfall of the country beg an in 734 BC, and ended with the defeat of their capital at Samaria in 722 BC. Plus there was another incursion into Samaria in 720 BC. The actual deportation of Israel ites which began with the initial Assyrian attacks from 734)732 BC, actually continue d until 715 BC. Three different Assyrian kings were responsible for the forced depo rtation of Israelites to Assyria: Tiglath)pileser III (745)727 BC), Shalmaneser V (72 7)722 BC) and Sargon II (722)705 BC). The result was that the Israelite population i n northern Israel was virtually wiped out. In 722)721 BC, Shalmanser V, the King of Assyria co nquered the Northern Kingdom"},{"pageNumber":855,"pageContent":"of Israel, captured Samaria, and took these ten tri bes to Assyria where they were imprisoned in Halah, Habor, Hara, and the river of Gozan. For all intents and purposes, these tribes seemingly disappeared, and they became known as the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel. It is believed, for the most part, that the southern tribes of Judah and Benjamin make up what is known as the Jewish people of today . However, Biblical evidence points to the fact that it was known where these tr ibes were. In 2 Chronicles 30:1)10, recorded many years after the exile of the Northern tribes, you’ll find this passage: “And (King) Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, to keep the passover unto the LORD God o f Israel ... So they established a decree to make proclamation throughou t all Israel, from Beersheba even to Dan, that they should come to keep the pass over unto the LORD God of Israel at Jerusalem: for they had not done it of a long time in such sort as it was written. So the posts went with the letters from th e king and his princes throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to t he commandment of the king, saying, Ye children of Israel, turn again unto the LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, and he will return to the remnant of yo u, that are escaped out of the hand of the kings of Assyria ... So the posts passe d from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh even unto Zebulun: but they laughed them to scorn, and mocked them.” This indicates that the King knew where the tribes were and was able to send them correspondence, so they were never really lost at a ll. Genesis relates that Cain made his way to a land wh ere he built “a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son Eno ch.” (Genesis 4:17) Although there has been extensive archeological research around th e area where Eden was believed to have been located, no remains of such a city has been found. But there is a city that bears the name– Tenochtitlan. However, this was the capital of the Aztec empire, which later became known as Mexico City. In 1 Chronicles 1:19 it says: “And unto Eber were b orn two sons: the name of the one was Peleg; because in his days the earth was di vided: and his brother’s name was Joktan.” Peleg was born around 2248 BC and the con founding of speech took place at the Tower of Babel around 2234 BC. The text in Chro nicles could be referring to people dividing up into various groups– according to langu age similarity. However, some researchers believe that this passage reflects the fact that prior to Peleg, all the continents were connected. This confirms the scient ific concept known as the Continental Drift Theory (even though it happened m uch later), and illustrates that the descendants of Noah were able to migrate to lands a ll around the world on natural land bridges. In Genesis 35:11, Israel is referred to as a “natio n and a company of nations,” and is a veiled prophetic reference to what would later oc cur. Undoubtedly the ten ‘lost’ tribes were assimilated into local populations, and branch es also eventually migrated west. In 1165, Benjamin of Tudela (son of Jonah), in Spai n, set out to explore the world, recording his adventures in his Book of Travels . In the mountains of Persia, he ran"},{"pageNumber":856,"pageContent":"across Jewish tribesmen who he believed were descen dants of the tribes of Dan, Zebulun, Asher, and Naphtali. In Arabia, he discove red the largest Jewish settlement in the region– the Jews of Kheibar, who he identified as being from the tribes of Reuben and Gad. In the early 16th century, Bartholeme de Las Casas, wrote of the Indians in the West Indies, Peru, and Guatemala: “Indeed, I can bring p roofs from the Bible that they are of the Lost Tribes.” A report 120 years later by Portu guese traveler Antonio Montezinos indicated that there was an Indian tribe living bey ond the mountain passes of the Andes that represented a remnant of a Jewish tribe. He wr ote: “I myself heard them recite the Shéma (the expression of Jewish faith) and saw them observe the Jewish rituals.” There is also evidence of Israelites in this countr y before the Assyrian deportation, such as the unusual custom of the American Indian t ribes referring to themselves as nations. In North Carolina, the Machapunga Indians circumcis e their babies and have some traditions that are similar to the Jews, as do the Savanna Indians from the banks of the Mississippi River. The Yuchi Indians in Oklahoma have a custom which i s unique among other American Indian tribes, which proves that they are racially and linguistically different from their neighbors. In True Discoverers of America William Dankenbring, wrote: “Every year on the fifteenth day of the sacred mont h of harvest, in the fall, they make a pilgrimage. For eight days they live in ‘booths’ wi th roofs open to the sky, covered with branches and leaves and foliage. During this festiv al, they dance around the sacred fire, and called upon the name of God.” This ritual is si milar to the Israelite Feast of Tabernacles (details of which are found in Leviticu s 23). Dr. Cyrus B. Gordon (professor of Mediterranean Studies at Brandeis University in Boston Massachusetts), an expert in Hebrew, Minoan, and many other Middle Eastern langu ages, was allowed to witness one of their fall harvest festivals, and said to hi s companion, “They are speaking the Hebrew names for God!” So, what we have is documented proof that the Jews did indeed migrate to other countries. In the course of this migration, they pr oduced many branches which assimilated themselves into the local populations o f these various countries. With the establishment of the nation of Israel, and in fulfi llment of prophecy, many Jews from many lands have returned to their home. The seventh chapter of Revelation speaks of a ‘sealing’ of 144,000 Jews from the following tribes : Judah, Reuben, Gad, Asher, Naphtali, Simeon, Levi, Issachar, Zebulon, Joseph, Benjamin, and Manasses (substituted for Dan). It is assumed that they will be from within the population of the nation of Israel. Is it possible that there is stil l pure)blood descendents of these tribes? One would assume that if they are not, can they sti ll be considered members of the tribe? If so, and with their Jewish roots lost, are the various branches that migrated to other countries, where they still continue to live, able to consider themselves as representative of their respective tribes? Following this course of speculative thinking, can we use this as another confirmation to prove that the ten ‘lost’ tribes, w hich migrated westward into the area now known as Europe, is actually the “ten horns” or “ten kings,” which is believed to be Europe. I mentioned earlier that Leonardo Da Vinci was a me mber of the Prieuré de Sion. As"},{"pageNumber":857,"pageContent":"a matter of fact, from 1510)1519, he was the Nauton nier (‘helmsman’) or Grand Master of the group. One interesting piece of information I found out was that da Vinci was alleged to have been the one who forged and painted the Shroud of Turin, which is purported to be the burial cloth of Jesus, which is now in possession of the Catholic Church. The authenticity of this cloth has been deb ated for many years. After it was carbon dated and determined that it is not old enou gh to have been the burial cloth, then came testing which proved that there was an or ganic bacterial coating over it which distorts carbon dating results.  Leonardo Da Vinci  Figure on Shroud  Face on Shroud It was Dr. Leoncio A. Garza)Valdes, a microbiologis t who reached that determination. In a quest to once and for all prove its authenticity, he went a bit farther. There were ‘sticky tape’ samples taken from areas o f the shroud that appeared to be blood. Garza)Valdes had these remnants from the lef t hand (by the STURP group in 1978), and from the occipital region (by Riggi in 1 988). Not only was he able to determine that it was actually blood, but that it w as the blood (AB group) of a human male. Since the secret of the Holy Grail centers on the ‘ blood’ or to be more precise, the ‘bloodline,’ is the shroud a piece of the puzzle. D r. Garza)Valdes has allayed any fears of the possibility that someone could try to extrac t DNA from it in an attempt to clone the man on the shroud, because he said that any blood s amples which could be retrieved from it would be so degraded that it would be insuf ficient to allow the possibility of cloning. However, is the quality of it good enough to prove a bloodline? The story that has been outlined up to now refers t o Jesus and Mary Magdalene being married and having a child. As Christians we know that not to be true. However, it is no secret that Jesus had brothers (James, Joses, Simon, Judas or Juda) and sisters (Mathew 13:55), and their bloodline could have very well survived through their descendents. Eusebius states that “Cthere still survived of the Lord’s family the grandsons of Jude (James and Jude), who was said to be His brother, h umanly speaking. These were"},{"pageNumber":858,"pageContent":"informed against as being of David’s line and broug ht C before Domitian Caesar C (who) asked them whether they were descended from D avid, and they admitted itC” Eusebius said that the descendents of Jesus’ family became leaders of various Christian churches, and traced them to the time of the Emperor Trajan (98)117 AD). A Roman Catholic account documents a fourth century i ncident in 318, when the Bishop of Rome, now referred to as Pope Sylvester I, met w ith eight Desposyni (descendents of Jesus’ family) leaders. Each of them was a leade r of a branch of the Church at the Lateran Palace. They demanded that the confirmation of the bishops of Jerusalem, Antioch, Ephesus and Alexandria be revoked, and tha t the titles be conferred on members of their family, and that their Church in J erusalem be considered the Mother Church. Sylvester refused, and there was no subsequ ent contact reported. The New Testament (Galatians 2:9) bears out the fact that “ James, Cephas (Peter), and John” were the leaders of the Church in Jerusalem, and by virtue of the order they were mentioned, and bloodline, James was probably the he ad of it.   Eusebius  Sy lvester I As far as the Shroud of Turin– it could very well b e the actual burial cloth of Christ. But if it is a forgery, to believe that Leonardo da Vinci (1452)1519) fabricated it may be a stretch, since the earliest report of its existence was in 1357. Of course, if anybody could have done it, da Vinci is probably the most l ikely suspect in that he had trained to be an engineer, and was a scientific genius, as wel l as an artist. So, we must consider the fact, that if the shroud is a fake, either some body else did it, or da Vinci did it and substituted it for the real one. Just for kicks and giggles, let’s assume that at so me point, it will be determined that the Shroud is the authentic burial shroud of Christ (even if it may not be). When some international leader rises to power, and it appears that he embodies every quality that the world is looking for in a leader, and even seem s to fulfill the Biblical prophecies of a coming Messiah, what would happen if the DNA of his blood would match the DNA of the blood on the shroud? Who better to lead a unite d Europe, then a living descendant of Jesus Christ, who could also use New Age philoso phy to claim that he is a reincarnation of the Son of God.

Once this leader takes his place as the head of the revived H oly Roman Empire, it will not be long before he is revealed to be the antagonist referred to in the Bible as the Antichrist. After wading through all of the information and spe culation I have presented to you, finally you have reached the point where you can un derstand the whole premise upon which this book was based. It is my belief that the purpose of the movement towards a New World Order, is to establish a one)world govern ment, and to set the stage for the rise of the Antichrist. THE ANTICHRIST Waiting For a Man Paul)Henri Spaak (1888)1972), the socialist leader, President of the Consultive Assembly of the Council of Europe from 1949)51, and former Secretary)General of NATO, who was one of the three major proponents of a united Europe said: “We do not want another committee. We have too many already. W hat we want is a man of sufficient stature to hold the allegiance of all pe ople, and to lift us out of the economic morass into which we are sinking. Send us such a ma n and, be he God, or the devil, we will receive him.” Paul)Henri Spaak Such a man will arise, and his ascent to power is d iscussed in various places in the Bible. This chapter is the culmination of everythin g you have read up to now. I believe that the I Iluminati has been working behind the scenes to cre ate an environment that will enable one man to gain enough power to finally pull the countries of Europe together into one political entity. “And four great beasts came up from the sea, divers e one from another.

And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, which have received no kingdom yet; but receive power as kings one hour with the beast. These have one mind, and shall give their power and strength unto the beast.” (Revelation 17:10)13) The Scriptures have given us an excellent indicatio n of the origin of the man who will be known as the Antichrist. The term “Antichrist” i s first used in 1 John 2:18, and an indirect reference in 2 Thessalonians 2:4, refers t o his opposition to God, which has given rise to the prevalent thought that Antichrist meant “against” Christ, when in fact, as Pastor Milt Maiman (formerly of the Messianic He brew Christian Fellowship in Harrisburg, PA) pointed out to me, the prefix ‘anti ’ doesn’t refer to the Latin which means ‘against’; but it is actually derived from th e Greek ‘ante’ which was used to indicate a contrast or substitution, and means ‘to take the place of,’ or ‘in front of,’ or ‘before or prior to.’ Daniel 8:8 refers to the four powers who are Greece , Turkey, Syria, and Egypt; and Daniel 7:7)8 speaks of the seventh world empire, co nsisting of ten kingdoms, and the rise of another. The second chapter of Daniel, whic h refers to the dream of Nebuchadnezzar, clearly points out that the ten toe s (kingdoms) are an extension of the previous world empire, or Rome, which would then en compass all of the countries that fell within the boundaries of the Holy Roman Empire : parts of Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya; Egypt; part of Saudi Arabia; Jordan, Isr ael, Syria, and Turkey; Portugal, Spain, France, Belgium, Luxembourg, part of the Net herlands, England, part of Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Italy, Greece, part of Hungary, part of Yugoslavia, part of Romania, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Albania, Slovenia, Croatia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina."},{"pageNumber":862,"pageContent":"Let’s look at the ten horns or kingdoms, which many initially thought was represented by the original Common Market countries of France, West Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, England, Denm ark, Ireland, and Greece. The impact of the theory was lessened upon the later ad dition of Spain, Portugal, and Austria, which made a total of thirteen nations in what is now called the European Union. However, some still tried to make the argume nt, because Denmark and Ireland were not part of the Roman Empire. Another fact that supports the theory that the ten kings symbolically represent the area of western Europe is that there are only ten k ingdoms, or monarchies now in western Europe: Belgium, Denmark, Liechtenstein, Lu xembourg, Monaco, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom (Nort hern Ireland; Great Britain– England, Wales, Scotland). Another confirming theory emanates from Daniel 9:26 which says: “...the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city a nd the sanctuary...” The people that destroyed Jerusalem and the Temple in 70 AD were th e Romans. Revelation 14:8 says: “Babylon (sometimes perceived as a symbolic name fo r Rome) is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of t he wrath of her fornication.” According to Daniel 7:20, this leader of the eleven th country, will go against three of these nations, and defeat them. Yet, Revelation spe aks of the ten kings pledging their allegiance to the Antichrist. Do these ten include the eleventh nation of the Antichrist? Will he defeat the three nations, and replace them in the federation with his, and two others? Or will the three defeated nations remain, under the leadership of the eleventh? What is the purpose for the Antichrist to go agains t these three nations? Is it because they were not originally part of the revived Holy R oman Empire; or if they were, what else could prompt him to attack these countries? This beckons the theory about the ten tribes that l ived in the area of Rome. Three were defeated because they were Aryans who opposed the papacy– Herulians, Vandals, and Ostrogoths; while the other seven beca me the nations of western Europe– Visigoths, Franks, Anglo)Saxons, Sueves, Burgundian s, Alamanni, and Alans. One possible clue is that these nations may be apprehen sive about uniting behind the political leadership of the Antichrist. For example , when the European Community met in Maastricht, the Netherlands, in 1991, Great Brit ain and Denmark voted against the initiation of a common currency. Another theory tha t somebody e)mailed me, was that the three nations are Afghanistan (Media), Iraq (Ba bylon), and Iran (Persia), by virtue of the fact that the U.S. has occupied Afghanistan and Iraq. There are other theories concerning the origin of t he Antichrist. Some researchers believe that he has to come from Greece, Turkey, Sy ria, or Egypt; but not one of the countries which make up the ten nation federation. That would eliminate Greece. Could this country be Syria. In Isaiah 10:5, 10:24, 14:25 , 30:31, he is referred to as the “Assyrian.” In Micah 5:5 it says: “And this man sha ll be the peace, when the Assyrian shall come into our land: and when he shall tread i n our palaces, then we shall raise against him...” The Aramaeans, a semi)nomadic peopl e who migrated from the Arabian desert around the third century BC, into Syria and Mesopotamia, have also been called Syrians. Let’s also look at Habakkuk 1:6– “For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty nation, which shall march through the bre adth of the land, to possess dwelling)places that are not theirs.” The land of t he Chaldeans was in southern"},{"pageNumber":863,"pageContent":"Babylonia, in what is now southern Iraq. These refe rences seem to point to an Arabic background, and are given credence because they con sider themselves the enemies of Israel. A reference in Daniel 11:37 says: “Neither shall he regard the God of his fathers...” This may be an indication of Jewish ancestry, and s ome researchers believe that the Antichrist will be a Jew from the tribe of Dan. In Genesis 49:17, when the patriarch Jacob is speaking to his sons, he said: “Dan shall be a serpent by the way...” and Jeremiah 8:16 refers to the armies of Dan devouring the land. In the seventh chapter of Revelation, John omitted the name of Dan when he li sted the tribes of Israel. Dan and Ephraim were the first to lead Israel into adultery . Dan was replaced by the tribe of Manasseh (Joseph’s oldest son). Though we can’t be sure of the area of his origin, in the end, the Antichrist will succeed in doing what no man has been able to do si nce the fall of the Roman Empire in 476 AD. Charlemagne, Charles V, Louis XIV, Napol eon, Kaiser Wilhelm, Benito Mussolini, and Hitler all tried to take over Europe to unify it, but failed. The Antichrist will be a strong political leader, who will gain strengt h through statesmanship and promises of peace. On December 6, 1961, McGeorge Bundy (of t he CFR), Special Assistant to President Kennedy, told the Economic Club of Europe , that if Western Europe would unite as one power to have economic, military and p olitical unity, they would be a truly great power. Time magazine even wrote that the real aim of the Commo n Market was to become a single country. The political policies of the Antichrist will bring strength, stability and unity to Europe, while his economic policies will bring prosperity t o industry, agriculture, and commerce.

Boutros Boutros)Ghali  Kofi Annan THE MARK OF THE BEAST The Number of His Name The Antichrist will use economic terrorism to force the people of the world to follow him. “And he (the False Prophet) causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: And that no man might buy and sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name. Here is wisdom. Let him tha t hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six.” (Revelation 13:16)18) “...If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, The same shall drink of t he wine of the wrath of God ... And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for eve r and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and hi s image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.” (Revelation 14:9)1 1) Many people believe that the number 666 will be his mark, but the Bible doesn’t make itself clear on that point. Six is the number of man, because he was created on the sixth day, and given six ‘days’ to live. The nu mber 666 is the Satanic trinity, and will be the manner in which the Antichrist will be recog nized. Iranaeus (140)202), Bishop of Lyons, a pupil of Pol ycarp (who was a student of the"},{"pageNumber":868,"pageContent":"Apostle John), thought the number 666 was the Greek word “Lateinos”: L (30), A (1), T (300), E (5), I (10), N (50), 0 (70), S (200), whic h adds up to 666. The word means “Latin kingdom,” and it was later believed that thi s referred to the religion of the Vatican, because Latin is their official language, which is used in their canons, missals, prayers, and blessings. Rev. Jerry R. Church, founder and director of Proph ecy in the News ministry in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, reported that the Sumerian s of Noah’s time, who lived in what is now southern Iraq, used a sexagesimal syste m of numerics, which means that their numerical system was based on the number six, instead of ten. He theorized that since all language had a common base, and civilizat ion’s first numbering system was based on six, then a code could be devised to “coun t the number of the beast.” The English alphabet is based on the root value of six: 6” X 2= 1 foot, 6” X 6= 1 yard, 6 ‘forties’ = 1 section, 6 sections X 6= 1 township, 1 township = a 6 square mile area, etc. What he came up with was an alphanumeric code: A = 6, B = 12, C = 18, D = 24 , E = 30, F = 36, etc. Using this code, he discovered tha t various words and sequences or words, such as ‘Mark of the Beast,’ ‘Computer,’ and ‘New York’ were equivalent to the numerical value of 666. The number 666 became quite prominent in order to g et people familiar with it, and to eliminate the evil connotations that the number has. Listed below are only some of the areas where the number 666 has been used: 1) Koehring and Clark equipment companies used 666 as part of the product identification number on certain models. 2) Stickers distributed at DuPont Co. plants said: “To be in the know, call ‘Mom’ (666).” 3) Products of the Bliss)Hastings Co. contained the number 666. 4) The 85th Annual Frontiers Days Festival, held in Cheyenne, Wyoming, promoted July 23, 1981 as “666 Rodeo Day.” 5) The logo of Australia’s National Bank card conta ined a configuration of the number 666. 6) In August, 1980, the Chesapeake and Potomac Tele phone Co. of Virginia notified their customers that the telephone number of the U.S. Weather Service was being changed from 936)1212, to 666)1212. 7) Men’s dress shirts produced in China, and sold i n the U.S., had the number 666 on the label, forming the trademark of Kerman S cott Ltd. 8) At the official reopening of the Suez Canal on J une 5, 1975, the first Egyptian warship entering it, which was carrying Egyptian Pr esident Anwar Sadat, had the number 666 on its bow. 9) The World Bank code number was 666. 10) Some credit cards in the U.S. had the numerical prefix of 666. 11) The Olivetti Computer System P6060, used proces sing numbers which began with 666. 12) Sears, Belk, J. C. Penney, and Montgomery Ward computers were prefixing their transactions with the number 666, as mandated by its computer programming. 13) Shoes made in Italy had 666 stamped on the insi de label. It consisted of a"},{"pageNumber":869,"pageContent":"circle, divided in half; with a horned lamb (see Re v. 13:11) on top, and the number 666 on the bottom. It was later put on all C ommon Market products. 14) IBM computer equipment in supermarkets had the number 3X666 on them. 15) Visa credit cards represent the number 666: the Roman numeral for 6 is “VI”; the number 6 in ancient Greek was taken from the si xth letter of their alphabet, the letter “stigma,” which looks like the English “ S”; and in the Babylonian sexagesimal system, and “A” represented 6. Thus the word VISA forms the number 666. 16) Computers manufactured by Lear Siegler, Inc. in the U.S. and shipped to Israel, had a seal on the side stamped with the num ber 666, which was later discontinued. 17) The Federal Government Medicaid Service Employe es Division number was 666. 18) The Internal Revenue Service’s ATF (Alcohol, To bacco and Firearms) Division had the number 666 on their employeés badg es. 19) In 1977, the IRS began requiring the number 666 as a prefix on forms for tax payments on Individual Retirement Accounts (form W) 2P): Disability is 666.3, death is 666.4, etc. After a lot of protest, it was omitted in 1978)79, but resumed in 1980)81. 20) IRS instructions for the 1979 non)profit Corpor ation Employee W)2 form, required the prefix 666. 21) Some states had the number 666 on their requisi tion paperwork. 22) President Carter’s secret security force had pa tches with the number 666 on them. 23) Chrysler Corporation manufactured tanks for Pre sident Carter’s secret security force that had the number 666 on the side. 24) A contest sponsored by the Israeli Dept. of Educati on in 1980, featured a tic) tac)toe game, that allowed you to win money if you scratched off the numbers 666. 25) The McGregor Clothing Co. had introduced a “666 Collection” of menswear. 26) A telephone company in the mid)west had its cre dit cards encoded with the number 666. 27) Identification tags on Japanese)made parts for the Caterpillar Co. in Peoria, Illinois, had the number 666 on them as part of the product code. 28) FLXO Mens Chore Gloves made by the Boss Clove C o., were stamped with the number 666 as a style number, 29) The Crow’s Hybrid Corn Co. of Iowa offered a ‘6 66’ seed as its top yielding hybrid. 30) Scotty had offered a new improved 666 fertilize r. 31) South Central Bell’s Telco Credit Union cards h ad the prefix 666, and then the person’s Social Security number. 32) Metric rulers which were distributed in 1979 th roughout the country had the number 666 on them. 33) I.D. tags on 1979 General Motor cars manufactur ed in Flint, Michigan, had the number 666 on them. 34) U.S. Selective Service cards had the number 666 as part of its code."},{"pageNumber":870,"pageContent":"35) The overseas telephone operator number from Isr ael was 666. 36) After 1973, Arab)owned vehicles in Jerusalem ha d the prefix of 666 on their license plates, for the purpose of being able to id entify the enemy in case of war. 37) An album by the heavy metal band Black Sabbath was called 666 . 38) There was an elementary grade algebra book publishe d by the Thomas Corwell Co. in New York, titled 666 Jellybeans . 39) Mastercard had started to use the number ‘66’ o n their statements in August, 1980. 40) The formula for the NCR model 304 Supermarket C omputer was 6 60 6(which is six, three score, and six). 41) The ‘Sundial’ style floor tile manufactured by Armstrong, were prefixed with the number 666)13. 42) The cutter boom governing heads on coal mining equipment in Beckley, West Virginia, produced by the Lee Morse Co., were coded with the number 666. 43) Financial institutions in Florida were using th e number 666. 44) Parent and Teacher Training books from the Chan ning L.

The mark may be some sort of identification number, such as your Social Security number, which will serve to identify everyone. In None Dare Call It Conspiracy , author Gary Allen wrote (pg. 13): “...his (the individual’ s) freedom and choice will be controlled within very narrow alternatives by the fact that he will be numbered from birth and followed, as a number ... (until) his final retirem ent and death benefits.” It could be that your Social Security number could be used for such a system, since U.S. law requires every citizen to have such a number by the time the y enter the first grade. The move is on for everyone in the United States to have an identification card. A Special Presidential Commission on Immigration and Refugees had recommended a national identification card in an attempt to keep illegal aliens in check. The U.S. News and World Report , in their September 15, 1980 issue, ran an article called “A National Identity Card?” It reported that the Federal Govern ment was planning an identification card that would prevent anyone without one from wor king or transacting any sort of business. This computerized system would keep track of every citizen, According to a 1994 proposal by the Congressional Commission on Im migration Reform, all American citizens and legal immigrants would be given a nati onal identification card. The project was later shelved, but elsewhere the move is on. In 1995, the European Union was to begin issuing identification cards to all the citiz ens of western Europe. In California, driver’s licenses were to be issued that would contain a microchip with personal information, motor vehicle records, crimin al records, a photograph, and fingerprints. The Department of Defense at the Pent agon issued the MARC (Multi) Technology Automatic Reader) card to their soldiers . It contained a bar code, a magnetic strip, a digitized photograph, and an inte grated circuit computer chip. An internal Pentagon memo stated that the card would e ncode all of a soldier’s records. This 6.6 megabyte Laser Card from Drexler Technolog y Corporation can store nearly"},{"pageNumber":871,"pageContent":"2,000 pages of information, which is more than enou gh for identification numbers, biographical information, school records, photograp hs, signature, voice print, fingerprints, medical and health care records, cred it and banking information, job information and activities. It is believed that thi s card will be the prototype for any national identification card that will be issued to U.S. citizens. With all of this computerization going on, it’s obv ious that there needs to be a data base to store it all this information so that it ca n be accessed and used. Starting back in 1973 it was being reported (most n otably in the August, 1976 issue of Christian Life magazine) that three floors of the thirteen)floor headquarters of the European Common Market in Brussels, Belgium was occ upied by a massive computer. Dr. Hanrick Eldeman, Chief Analyst for the Common M arket, said in a 1974 meeting of Common Market leaders during the unveiling of the h uge, self)programming computer known as ‘The Beast,’ that a computerized revitaliz ation project is being prepared to “straighten out world chaos,” and that the computer has the potential of “numbering every human on earth.” In 1977 (according to a 1990 Moody magazine article), this same Dr. Eldeman is reported to have said that he w as preparing to assign a number to everyone in the world. By using three entries of si x digits each, he said it would be possible for everyone in the world to be given a di stinctive number. As it turns out, the information was actually taken from the novel Beyond a Pale Horse by Joe Musser, who later adapted it as a screenpla y for a David Wilkerson film called The Rapture . It is believed that the confusion between fact an d fiction came because there were mock newspapers produced to prom ote the movie which contained things having to do with the end times, and the ‘Be ast’ computer was part of it. And then came the report that the ‘Beast’ computer had taken a backseat to the computer in the Jean Monnet Building (rue Alcide de Gasperi) in Luxembourg, which has been called the largest in the world. Paul Pete rson wrote in his book Sinister World Computerization : “I saw the center in Luxembourg that can compute facts and figures on everyone in the world.” I suspect that this is also a rumor since I have no t been able to find out anything about this book, nor can I connect this author with this type of research. You can see why the association was made when you look at some of the occupants of this building: Commission of European Communities (the European Un ion’s executive arm), European Bank of Investments, European Court of Jus tice, and the Secretariat of the European Parliament (who also work out of Strasbour g and Luxembourg). Well, enough with the fiction. The fact is, there i s a worldwide communications network already in place. Established in 1973, with only 239 banks from 15 countries, SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Te lecommunication, headquartered at Avenue Adèle 1, La Hulpe, Belgium– a southern su berb of Brussels) now has 7,500 members in 200 countries. This system links member banks across the globe in a manner designed to accommodate any type of computer system. The Burroughs Corporation (who acquired Sperry Corp. in 1986 and is now known as Unisys Corp.) developed the data processing and communications sy stem equipment that is used as a private communications system for the transmissio n of payment and other international banking transactions. Tata Consultanc y Services, Asia’s largest global software and services company provided the on)site support. It is made up of switching centers in Brussels (Belgium) and Amsterdam (Nether lands), which have been linked to"},{"pageNumber":872,"pageContent":"Burroughs data concentrators in Amsterdam, Brussels , Copenhagen, Frankfurt, Helsinki, London, Milan, Lux, Montreal, New York, O slo, Paris, Stockholm, Vienna, and Zurich. These data concentrators are linked to term inals in all the member banks of those countries. According to the book SWIFT: Banking and Business , Dr. T. Hugh Moreton said: “In early 1982 we are ready to believe every country in the world will be connected in one way or another to SWIFT.” The United States SWIFT B ank, built at a cost of $15 million, is located near the Federal Reserve Office in Culpe pper, Virginia. The biggest concentration of super computers in the world can be found at Fort Meade, Maryland, between Washington and Baltimore, at the headquarters of the National Security Agency, which is the most secret intelligence agency in our government. Occupying an area of a thousand acres, the NSA contains a $47,000,000 subterranean computer facility that stretches for b locks and has ten acres of Cray supercomputers. The supercomputers are tied into ea ch other with 52 separate computer systems from around the world. NSA Building It’s just a matter of time before everyone living i n the major industrial nations are tied into an international computer system through Socia l Security numbers, Driver’s License numbers, Credit Card numbers, Checking and Savings Account numbers, Birth Certificates, and Passports. All of your personal a nd financial information will be on record, including your employment and medical recor d, taxes paid, banking transactions, and property acquisitions. Basically, any type of information on you that has to be entered into a computer, will ultimately find its way into a database that can be accessed by the government. In 1798, Adam Clarke, a Methodist minister, said: “ The Mark of the Beast will be an 18 digit number, 6 + 6 + 6.” In this digital age, i t seems possible that a universal number could be used to identify people, rather than all d ifferent kinds of numbers. All other numbers, such as driver’s license numbers, banking account numbers, and credit card numbers would be phased out in lieu of your Social Security number, since it is already tied into your banking transactions, tax returns, a nd medical history. If any type of personal identification is every issued for the cit izens of the United States, it will most likely adapt your Social Security number so that it can be used to accomplish personal and financial transactions electronically."},{"pageNumber":873,"pageContent":"In the course of research for her books When Your Money Fails ... The “666 System” Is Here , and The New Money System , Mary Stewart Relfe, Ph.D., found out that Christians who sent back credit cards with a ‘666’ prefix were told that by 1982, the number would be on all cards. If that is the case, it must be encoded into the magnetic strip, which can only be read with a scanner. Relfe came to believe that if a Personal Identification Card (PIT) was issued, it would cont ain a magnetic strip, bar code, photograph, signature, and an 18)digit identificati on number that would look something like this: 666)110)202)123)45)6789 666) (International Code to Activate the World Comp uter) 110) (National Code to Activate Central U.S. Comput er) 202) (Telephone Area Code) 123)45)6789 (Social Security Number) The Cashless Society In 1974, Gary Allen wrote in A Decade Left- Has Orwell’s 1984 Come Early? : “Federal planners forsee the day when every citizen will have a money card instead of money to spend. The cards will be placed in a machi ne at each point of purchase, and the charge would be electronically subtracted from the customer’s Federal Reserve Account.” The November, 1975 issue of Progressive Grocer reported: “The day will come when one card will be good at any terminal, in any state...” In the September 21, 1976 issue of the Daily Oklahoman , was an article titled, “The Cashless Society Expected to Become Reality Soon,” which said: “The long)talked about cashless society is almost here. Bank debit cards are expected to go into nationwide use soon.” In the December 27, 1979 issue of Electronic Fund Transfer Report , there was an article titled “Electronic Money” which revealed: “A sophisticated point of sale system is quietly operated by the Chase Manhattan Bank in one of the banking industry’s best kept secrets. Chase is now directly linked to hundreds o f electronic cash registers or P.O.S. terminals in department and specialty stores ... by offering this service to merchants on a nationwide basis, a network will be created that will allow the Chase Manhattan Bank to have a national E.F.T. present.” On May 29, 1980, during ABC)TV’s Good Morning Ameri ca show, a Federal Reserve official talked about the existence of a ne w Federal debit card: “A thin piece of plastic which is to be inserted in automatic machin es. One must then punch in his own secret code number ... You are not to write your nu mber down, tell it to anyone, or record it anywhere. It must be memorized.” Giant Fo od, Inc. and the Safeway Stores were the first to install the Point)of)Sale compute rized Electronic Fund Transfer checkout machines in their supermarkets to take ban k debit cards. They were later joined by Mobil Oil who installed the system in all of its gas stations throughout the country. Since then, debit cards have quickly assim ilated themselves into all aspects of the retail industry. The plan was to combine the credit card and the deb it card into a single multi)use card which could be used to make deposits, pay bill s, transfer money, make"},{"pageNumber":874,"pageContent":"withdrawals, make purchases, and borrow money. On M arch 3, 1979, the Knight News Service in Miami, Florida reported: “By 1980, many bankers predict, most shoppers will exchange the wallet full of credit cards they now c arry for a single, all)purpose card and number.” In the September 17, 1979 issue of the Electronic Fund Transfer Report , in an article called “MasterCard,” it said: “In a speech, John J. Reynolds, President of Interb ank Card Association, said that ‘the newly named MasterCard (formerly known as Master Charge) will be a full transaction card, rather than just a credit ca rd C In significant ways, Interbank now had brought its EFT strategy in line with Visa’s. The debit card will bear the familiar red and ochre logo, in the same w ay that all Visa cards are blue, white and gold. Even the magnetic stripe specificat ion adopted for the new MasterCard now embraces an element introduced by Vi sa’s three digit service code in the discretionary datafield of track two. W ith this code, it will be possible to determine if a card from one country many be use d ... in another country. D. Sean Miller, Interbank Senior Vice)President, told EFT Report : ‘the real reason it’s there is that it would be very difficult to pu t it in later’.” According to the October 26, 1981 issue of Business Week , Russell E. Hogg, President of MasterCard International, Inc. predict ed: “Within five to seven years, there will be more debit cards in America than credit car ds.” An article in Time magazine, September 29, 1980 reported: “It looks and feels li ke a credit card, payment takes place instantly. A computer deducts funds from the shoppe r’s bank account and transfers them into that of the store or restaurant where pur chases have been made...” The cover of the January 18, 1982 issue of Business Week , depicted a single debit card for nationwide electronic banking. The accompanying art icle said: “One month ago key executives from a dozen of the largest U.S. and Can adian banks flew to a secret meeting at Chicago’s O’Hare Hilton Hotel to form a joint venture that would create the first National Retail)Banking Network ... the new n etworks should be far more powerful than Visa and MasterCard because they will operate with the debit card.” One of the reasons being given to move towards the cashless society, is the effect it would have on crime. An attorney wrote in the American Bar magazine: “Crime would be virtually eliminated if cash became obsolete. Ca sh is the only real motive for 90% of the robberies. Hence its liquidation would create m iracles in ridding earth’s citizens of muggings and holdups.” A cashless society would als o eliminate extortion and blackmail for money; and the purchase of illegal contraband, such as drugs and untaxed alcohol. However, it’s obvious that the real reason for goin g cashless is that the population can be monitored, controlled and manipulated. On the reverse side of all credit and debit cards i s a 1/2” X 3” magnetic stripe, which is called a ‘magstripe’ and contains three tracks ( each about one)tenth of an inch long): Track 1 is 210 bits per inch (bpi), and holds 79 6) bit plus parity bit read)only characters. The information is contained in two for mats– (A) Reserved for propriety use of the card issuer; (B) Start Sentine l (1 character), Format Code=”B” (1 alpha character), Primary Account Numbe r (up to 19), Separator (1), Country Code (3), Name (2)26), Separator (1), Expir ation Date or Separator (4 or"},{"pageNumber":875,"pageContent":"1), Discretionary Data (enough characters to fill o ut remaining maximum capacity of 79 character), End Sentinel (1), Longitudinal Re dundancy Check Character (1) Track 2 is 75 bpi, and holds 40 4)bit plus parity b it characters. The format was developed by the banking industry– Start Sentinel ( 1 character), Primary Account Number (up to 19), Separator (1), Country Code (3), Expiration Date or Separator (4 or 1), Discretionary Data (enough char acters to fill out remaining maximum capacity of 40 character), End Sentinel (1) , Longitudinal Redundancy Check Character (1) Track 3 is 210 bpi, and holds 107 4)bit plus parity bit characters. It is a read/write track which includes an encrypted PIN, country code , currency units, and amount authorized, but its use is not universal among bank s. However, technology is changing so rapidly, that th e magnetic strip has been rendered obsolete by the ‘Smart Card,’ which has a 2 line display screen, yet is only slightly larger than a credit card. Instead of a ma gnetic strip, it is imbedded with an integrated circuit chip for the storage of informat ion, and it can be updated each time the card is used. With this card, a person could shop, bank, and receive social services; and it could be used to store their medical history , Social Security records and other personal information. It eliminates credit card fra ud because there is no number on it. However, since the chip card costs between $20)$50 to produce, and the magnetic strip only costs 60¢ to produce; and most electronic syst ems have already been set up for the magnetic strip, it is unlikely that the industr y will convert. A Smart Card In the April, 1980 edition of Business Week , there was an advertisement for National Cash Register, for the financial (cashless) termina ls, which featured a card called the “Worldwide Money Card” which they said will replace all the world’s currencies. Another advertisement in the November 5, 1981 edition of th e Wall Street Journal read: “A new banking era has begun and Citibank invites you to b e in the forefront ... A global system linking every major city in America to a bank with a financial service network that circles the entire world.” Dr. Emil Gaverluk (who has a doc torate in Educational Technology and is an expert in Communications Science), of the Southwest Radio Church, said: “The next card beyond Visa’s stage will be a univer sal card, and will probably be issued out of Europe. It will be issued to all industriali zed nations and they’ll tell you this is the"},{"pageNumber":876,"pageContent":"best card you’ve ever had in your life ... the next stage after that is the number on the forehead or hand.” Paper currency and checks will be phased out in lie u of debit cards, and the plan seems to be for debit cards to be converted to the International Card, as all the nations do away with their monetary systems to do business through computers. But people will lose their card, or have it stolen, or accidentally mutilate it. You have probably noticed that the magnetic strip on your credit cards does n ot hold up well. The constant rubbing against each other, and against your wallet, causes scratches and drop outs on the strips which can not be read by scanners. These arg uments will result in numbers being lasered directly on the body. Professor B. A. Hodson, director of the Computer Ce nter at the University of Manitoba, had recommended an identifying mark to be put on the forehead of every person. The cover of the September 20, 1973 issue o f Senior Scholastics , a high school publication, showed a group of kids with numbers ta ttooed on their foreheads, and the feature article was titled, “Public Needs and Priva te Rights ) Who Is Watching You?” An advertisement by the First Tennessee Bank, showed a man with his bank number tattooed on his arm, implying that this was the onl y way to remember your number. Initially, a process had been developed to create a permanent non)toxic fluid that could be invisibly tattooed on human flesh, until a particular light, such as infrared or ultraviolet, shown on it. The process was tested by tattooing Social Security numbers on babies. In 1974, a Washington State University prof essor, Dr. R. Keith Farrell, invented a laser gun, which he used to number fish, which ac complished the task in less than a second. When asked if the gun could be used to put numbers on people, he said: “It could indeed be used for such a purpose.” The laser beam can not be felt, the number can not be seen with the naked eye, and it is as pe rmanent as your fingerprints. In the October, 1980 edition of Advertising Age magazine, TeleResearch Item Movement, Inc. (TRIM) had a full page advertisement for their supe rmarket computer scanner, which featured the picture of a man with a UPC symbol pri nted on his forehead. Dr. Ray Brubaker wrote in his book, Is the Antichrist Now Here? : “In Cincinnati, Ohio, an experiment was conducted in which there was affixed on the back of each hand a number that was read by a scanner in the supermarke t where these people did their shopping. As each item was checked out, the cash re gister simultaneously flashed it to the proper bank, where it was automatically deducte d from that person’s account.” A full)page illustration which appeared in a 1993 iss ue of the London Daily Mail , showed housewives in Europe making purchases by putting th eir hands on a computer screen at the cash register. Another alternative has to be considered here also. Note that in Revelation 13:16, it says that the “mark” will be placed “in” the right hand or forehead, not “on” it. An article in the October 2, 1980 edition of the Seattle Post-Intelligence r reported: “Race horses and house cats or other domestic anima ls may be injected with minute electronic wafers that will help owners trac e their animals. Vern Taylor, President of Identification Devices, Inc., said tha t the wafer is printed with a serial number and injected into the animal, When an electr onic wand is passed over the area, the serial number is displayed on a digit al readout. He said that the microchip will be sold to vetinarians. A computer d ata bank, known as the Animal"},{"pageNumber":877,"pageContent":"Bureau of Identification, will also help law enforc ement officials as well as animal control officers identify animals.” An article in the June 21, 1981 edition of the Denver Post reported that “a chip ... about the diameter of the lead in an automatic penc il ... can be injected with a simple insulin)type syringe into a human (or animal) ... o ne wafer is encoded with a 12)digit unique number.” It can also be placed on inanimate objects to electronically monitor the whereabouts of store merchandise and leased equipme nt. A Washington Times article (October 11, 1993) contained a report by Martin And erson, Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institute, concerning a solution for the problem of people losing their identification cards. He said: “You see, there is an identification syste m you can’t lose. It’s the Syringe Implantable Transponder, a permanent method of iden tification using radio waves. A tiny microchip, the size of a grain of rice, is sim ply injected under the skin.” With this microchip, satellites can identify your location wi thin 15 feet. I’ve read reports that suggested that the governmen t was using the mandatory infant immunization program to secretly implant these chip s. That was never proven. Besides, I believe that part of the end)time plan is for you to make a choice as to who you are going to serve. Now, ten years later, the system has been refined a nd perfected. The Palm Beach, Florida)based company, Applied Digital Solutions ha s made its VeriChip available for insertion into humans. The microchip, about the siz e of a tip of a ball point pen (12 mm X 2.1 mm), which contains a unique verification num ber, is implanted in the (right) arm or the hip, using a syringe)like device and a local anesthetic for the pain. The advantages being touted is that hospital officials and security personnel can access a person’s medical history and confirm identity. The company has said that they are also developing technology that will enable satellites t o track people who have been kidnapped. Details about their product is sketchy.

They ob viously have the capability of scanning your hand. For a time, a few years ago, I began to see upright scanners. With a flat scanner, the cashier only had to slide the item acr oss the scanning plate; but with the upright scanner, the cashier has to lift the item u p in front of the scanner. I was amazed the first time I seen one, because right away I kne w that its purpose wasn’t to make things easier for the cashier, it was to make it ea sier to scan your forehead and hand. Recent versions have placed them lower on the check out station. I haven’t seen a lot of them, so I don’t know if the retail industry as a w hole is going to upgrade to this version of the scanner. We have been talking about future developments, so let’s talk about the present. Do you realize that with the Universal Product Code (U PC), we are already buying and selling under the number 666."},{"pageNumber":879,"pageContent":"In 1970, the National Association of Food Chains, a nd five other major trade associations representing manufacturers, wholesaler s, and retailers, met, and formed an ad hoc committee to set up guidelines for an enc oding system that could be accepted by the entire industry. In 1971, a code ma nagement committee came up with the concept of a ten)digit numerical code: the firs t five to identify the manufacturer, and the last five to identify the specific item. In 197 2, the Uniform Grocery Product Code Council, Inc. and Distribution Codes, Inc. (in char ge of assigning numbers) was established, with thousands of companies invited to become members. On April 3, 1973, the ad hoc committee announced that they had selected a twelve)digit bar code that could be printed by conventional methods, and be scanned omni)directionally by an automated system. By the end of 1974, the Uniform G rocery Product Code Council had changed their name to the Uniform Product Code Coun cil, Inc., and had 21 representatives from manufacturers, distributors, a nd trade associations on their Board. Around 2,600 companies, representing a total of $70 .7 billion in annual sales, had become members of the Code Council, and were utiliz ing the bar coding on their products. The UPC system functions like this. The prices are marked on the shelf and not the item (although some chains continue to put prices o n the items). As the items are carried down the conveyer belt, the cashier pulls t he item, symbol downward, across the scanner, and bags the item. The scanner contains a laser beam which emits a beam of light. The white bars or spaces will reflect more l ight than the black bars, which is measured by a light detector. A time measurement of how long the beam takes to move across the bar and space, is also used for decoding . The scanner reads the symbol, no matter what direction it is passed over the scanner , from several inches, to a foot away, decoding the number and sending the number to a com puter. The computer transmits to the electronic cash register, the price of the p roduct, which is indicated on a display, and printed on the receipt tape. Checkout time is speeded up by 60)70% over the conv entional method, eliminating the need for as many employees. When the register t otals the purchase, the printed receipt tape usually indicates the store name, numb er, and location, item name, item price, whether it is taxable, and the total. It all ows for payment in cash, food stamps, check, debit card, or credit card; and deducts the coupons which are presented. It tells how much change is received, the date, time, and la ne number. Besides the quickness and efficiency, another feature of the system is th e ability to automatically keep track of inventory. Left Hand Guide Bar (101– 2 black bars and 1 white bar) represents the number 6, and tells the computer that information is comin g. Center Bar (01010– 3 white bars and 2 black bars) w hich represents the number 6, and separates the design. Right Hand Guide Bar (101– 2 black bars and 1 white bar) represents the number 6, and tells the computer that the informati on is complete.

It must appea r in a rectangular block on the bottom, side or back panel of a product, or anywher e it can be scanned. The bar code is a series of black and white parallel bars, 30 black and 31 white (for 10 digits), with white margins on each side. Each digi t of the code is represented by two black bars, and two white bars, which is compos ed of seven data elements or ‘modules.’ A module may be white or black. A whi te or black bar can be made up of 1, 2, 3, or 4 modules. Modules are all the same width, being that they are the foundation of the system, and create the bars w hich are visible to the naked eye. Design features of the UPC symbol actually represen t the number 666 If you look at the diagram of the UPC symbol, you w ill notice that the symbol is split into two sides, a left)hand side, using an odd numb er of modules; and a right)hand side, using an even number of modules, making them opposi te of each other. Thus, it doesn’t matter if the symbol is entered upside)down. For ea ch set of 7 modules is a number, and each number is represented by a field whose opt ical bars are broken down into the following binary codes, where 0 = a blank space, an d 1 = a black bar: Set 1 (left side) 0 ) 0001101 1 ) 0011001 2) 0010011 3 ) 0111101 4 ) 0100011 5 ) 0110001 6 ) 0101111 7 ) 0111011 8 ) 0110111 9 ) 0001011 "},{"pageNumber":881,"pageContent":"Set 2 (right side) 0 ) 1110010 1 ) 1100110 2 ) 1101100 3 ) 1000010 4 ) 1011100 5 ) 1001110 6 ) 1010000 7 ) 1000100 8 ) 1001000 9 ) 1110100 The UPS Code begins with a Number System Character (on the left of the symbol): 0 = Grocery 1 = Unknown 2 = Variable weight items such as fruit, meat and p roduce 3 = National Drug Code and Health Related Items 4 = Reserved for NDC and HRIC, if manufacturer iden tification code on left has to be expanded to 11 digits (1st five on the left s ide, 6th will be placed at the right of the symbol) 5 = Reserved for use on coupons 6 = Encodes a 12)digit code when the code must be e xpanded 7 = Unknown 8 = Unknown 9 = Encodes a 12)digit code in stores where more in formation is needed on symbol The first group of numbers (generally 5) is the Man ufacturer’s Code, and the second group of numbers (generally 5) is the Manufacturer Product Code (such as an item number). The Code ends with a Check Character (to t he right of the symbol) whose purpose is to check for errors, such as an unauthor ized addition of lines that could result in the computer reading the wrong number. There are various other UPC Code designs that have been utilized such as the Zero Suppression Method (Design #2, 2nd most commonly us ed design) which permits zeros to be eliminated from the ten digit code number, th ereby narrowing it to six numbers, which reduces the width of the symbol so it can fit on a product with a smaller package. Known as truncation, this method also reduces the h eight by shortening the length of the vertical lines; but it also reduces the compute r’s effectiveness in reading the symbol omni)directionally. It is the second most commonly used UPC design. Mary Stewart Relfe believed that the intention of this alternate design was to insure that the general public would not crack the UPC code. It actually re presents half of the regular symbol. The design incorporates bar codes from the first an d second sets, and from a third set created from the second set. There is an extended version of the main design (De sign #3) for use on magazines and books. While the main portion of the design wil l only use bar codes from the first"},{"pageNumber":882,"pageContent":"and second sets; the extended area on the right sid e of the symbol will use bar codes from all three sets. Going back to Revelation 13:17, it says: “And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.” Incredibly, as you have seen, through the use of the UPC system of encoding products, we are actually buying and selling with the number 666. Th e left and right)hand guides, and center bar patterns in Design #1, is designated by the following binary codes: left)hand guide: 101 center bar pattern: 01010 right)hand guide: 101 Just to verify, when you consider the number 6 when used as a Data Character, as in the second set, the number 6 is encoded as 10100 00. In other words, the only visible modules of the number 6, is the designation of 101, which is used in the left and right) hand guides, and the center bar pattern. Since the Data Characters use a seven module encodation, and the two guides and center pa ttern consist of three and five modules, it is obvious that the two numerical encod ations are different. While the numbers at the middle of the UPC symbol represent t he Manufacturer Code, and the Manufacturer Product Code; the numbers encoded in t he two guide bars and center bar pattern, represent the number “666.” This “666” cod e can be found in every UPC symbol. In Design #2, which is half of Design #1, i t incorporates a third bar code for the number six, which is represented by half of the cen ter bar pattern, or a module pattern of 010. The number 6 is a prominent part of the UPC, symbol . In Design #1, there are six numbers on the left side, and six numbers on the ri ght side. There are six numbers in Design #2. There are six different variations of th e UPC symbol. Six is the perfect computer number, a fact, which, according to the Wall Street Journal (November 11, 1981), led Apple Computer, Inc. to introduce their Apple I units at a price of $666.66. Richard J. Mindlin, Executive Vice)President of the Uniform Product Code Council had said: “There are no unidentified characters in the symbol, as each encodation serves either as data characters or for information to indicate to the scanner to start or stop reading. These start and stop characters are n ot the same as the encodation for the digit ‘6’.” George J. Laurer, who invented the UPC in 1973 has said: “There is nothing sinister about this nor does it have anything to do with the Bible’s ‘mark of the beast.’ It is simply a coincidence like the fact that my first, middle, and last name all have six letters. There is no connection with an international money code e ither.” As of November 2000, Mr. Laurer has stopped responding to questions about th is."},{"pageNumber":883,"pageContent":" George J. Laurer I can understand his contention that he is being ac cused of creating something that is inherently evil. We have been quick to attach a negative connotation to it, but the fact of the matter is, Bible prophecy has been fulfilled , we are buying and selling with the number 666. That is undeniable. The Apostle John ma de a prophetic observation– he gave us a sign to look for. So, regardless of all t he mechanics of how we got there, we are there. Those stores who already have electronic fund trans fer (EFT) capabilities, and are accepting debit cards, are pulling funds directly f rom a customer’s checking account, and transferring it to the store’s account at the b ank. At this point, it is not known if the system can accept an international debit card, howe ver it is reasonably safe to assume that the system was created to accommodate the fina l step, or the ‘mark of the beast.’ Besides the warning in Revelation 14:10 not to take this Mark; the Law of Moses in Leviticus 19:28 said: “Ye shall not ... print any m arks upon you...” Revelation 16:2 indicates that those who take the Mark will be stri cken with a “grievous sore.” Frank Forrester Church Sen. Frank Church said in August, 1975, that “the g overnment has the technological capacity to impose ‘total tyranny’ if ever a dictat or came to power. There would be no place to hide.” The Antichrist will be that dictato r. With the potential of money and debit cards being lost or stolen, the idea of a number be ing applied with a laser to your skin may also be going by the wayside because of it bein g exposed to external conditions.

When Revelation 14:17 says that you won’t be able to “buy or sell” without the “mark,” this is an obvious financial connection. Wh en the economic infrastructure of this country is totally converted to a system that is co mpletely cashless, everything will then be in place for the implantable identification tech nology. Your pay will be direct deposited, your bills will be automatically withdra wn from your checking account; and when you go to the grocery store, to the doctor, or to get gas, if you don’t have a chip, you will not be able to “buy or sell,” because you will not have a means to access your account. Those who do not take the Mark will be har assed by the government, and eventually be targeted for arrest and detention. Tr ue Christians, who refuse to take the Mark, will become fugitives when their rights are t aken away. THE INVASION OF ISRAEL Bible prophecy and Biblical interpretation have com e a long way in the past 40 years. I grew up reading the works and research of many great men of God, which certainly had an influence on how I viewed end)time events. At times, I would just take things for granted, or just assume that someone was right on how they saw things. But as I got older, and started my own research, and I began to put everything together, somehow things just were not meshing. If you are a student of Bible prophecy, like I am, you have probably heard a number of end)time theori es and scenarios. Many seem plausible. But again, they don’t always seem to tot ally fit into the scheme of things. As I said earlier, space just did not permit a deta iled examination, so I have been relegated to just providing an overview of things. Throughout this book, I have tried to give various alternatives for different aspects of prophetic events, rather than concretely saying that, ‘This is the way it is.’ The writings of Ezekiel, Daniel, and Revelation are a collection of very mysterious writings; and Daniel is specifically, because of its concept of using dual prophecy. In pooling the resources together that I have, I ha ve been slowly developing a picture to provide a sort of chronology of end)time events. As a child, when I would be in church listening to ministers talking about the Ant ichrist and the last days, I always wondered how all that could be possible– how the wo rld could ever be brought to the place where one man could exercise so much authorit y over it. When I found out about the I Iluminati that seemed to answer all my questions. H owever, the ensuing research actually created more questions, because the direct ion it seemed to take veered away from the traditionally held views of Bible prophecy . I actually considered stopping here, rather then taking the chance of compromising this entire body of research, but, being a writer, I have to bring everything to its logical c onclusion. So, here we goC The Antichrist is Revealed “I am Antichrist, I am Antichrist, I know what I wa nt, I know how to get it; I want to destroy.” (from a song by the Sex Pistols, a punk)r ock band) "},{"pageNumber":885,"pageContent":"Daniel 9:27 says that the Antichrist will “confirm the covenant with many for one week.” Obviously to do this, he would have to be in a position of authority to do it. As of this writing, although Europe is as united as it ha s ever been, talks aimed at drafting a Constitution have broken down. Therefore, Europe as a truly unified political entity does not yet exist. It is believed that the Antichrist’s rise to power will be through that government. Will he be the one that will actually m ake it happen? Revelation 17:12 says: “And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, which have received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings one hour with the beast.” So, with the resources of a united Europe behind him, he would d efinitely have a political base from which to operate from diplomatically. According to Daniel, “his power shall be mighty,” ( 8:24) and “he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand,” (8:25). The success he will a chieve in Europe will no doubt give him international recognition. In Daniel 11:7, it s ays: “...and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations.” This seems to imply a larger scope of authority. Is it possible that he will become the Secretary)Ge neral of a UN that has been transformed into a world government (due to the eff orts of the New World Order)? How else would he be in a position to exercise authorit y over such a large group of people? The Middle East has been a powder keg for many year s because the Arab nations (Esau’s descendants) feel they had their birthright taken away by Israel (Jacob’s descendants). A covenant is made with “many for a w eek,” or seven years. Because the second part of that verse talks about causing the s acrifices to stop, which is an obvious reference to the reinstitution of Temple sacrifice is Jerusalem, it has been assumed that the covenant was just made with Israel. How can jus t Israel be referred to as “many?” The terminology dictates that the covenant would ha ve to be made with “many” nations, and it would have to be nations somewhat associated with Israel. This would seem to be a covenant between the Antichrist (leader of the world government), Israel and the Arab nations, in order to seek a peaceful solution to the Middle East crisis. Somehow he will achieve a diplomatic solution that will give t he Arabs what they want, and give the Jews the security they want, which will enable them to build or erect a Temple, on its original foundation, so that Temple sacrifice can b e resumed. Even though there were 300 specific predictions concerning Jesus, the Jewi sh people didn’t accept Him because they were expecting a great conqueror to de liver them from the Romans. However, it won’t take long for this western Europe an leader to be heralded as the Messiah they have been waiting for. The aim of a world government will be to seek compl ete disarmament in order to maintain peace. Any country that does not willingly join in will be forced to comply, as it says that “he shall destroy wonderfullyC” Meanwhile, the individual who has emerged as the pr eeminent religious leader in the world will succeed in bringing together the major r eligions to form a new coalition of Christianity that will be bound together with New A ge philosophy. To legitimize his claim of being called by God to lead the Church, he will use his mastery of the occult to give the illusion of being able to perform “miracles.” ( Revelation 13:13)14) In the “midst” (or 3)1/2 years) of the covenant, it seems that diplomacy was not enough to bring lasting peace to this region. In Da niel 11:40, we find a conflict between the “king of the north” and the “king of the south. ” Chapter 11:42)43 and historical prospective (dual prophecy) leads us to believe tha t the “king of the south” will be Egypt."},{"pageNumber":886,"pageContent":"The “king of the north” has been identified as Syri a, and it is believed that this is the country that the Antichrist will come out of. This conflict is identified as the vehicle through which the Antichrist gains control of the n ations (10 horns) of the old Holy Roman Empire. Well, that’s one scenario. You have to ask yourself, why would Egypt attack Sy ria? Since signing a peace treaty with Israel, Egypt has been involved in any armed conflicts. If anything, I could see Syria (who has been very militant) attacking Eg ypt because of their treaty with Israel. More important, Syria is a small country, a nd does not have the military capability to do all that is being attributed to it. Anyway, I think that the “king of the north” is referencing western Europe. After the “ten kings” r eceived their power, they were as “one mind.” (Rev. 17:13) Therefore, as one unified nation, they could be referred to as a “king.” And the nations of the Roman Empire are n orth. Who is the “king of the south” actually attacking? Daniel 11:40 doesn’t really say that the “king of the south” is attacking Israel. As I s aid earlier, Egypt does have a treaty with them. Of course, that could be broken. However, the passage seems to indicate that the “king of the south” is attacking the “king of the n orth.” Apparently the European Federation will have a protectionary force (peace k eepers) in place in the Middle East, and this is who the attack will be directed at. The “king of the north” will then respond with a major ground and naval offensive. However, i n the process of putting down this rebellion, “many countries shall be overthrown.” (D an. 11:41). It is stated that Edom, Moab, and Ammon will not be affected. Ironically, t hey, along with the Israelites, Arabians, Ishmaelites, and Midianites were the desc endants of Arphaxad, the son of Shem, the middle son of Noah. Their land was on the eastern shore of the Dead Sea, in an area now occupied by the country of Jordan. It i s logical to assume that the countries involved will be Arab countries, especially in ligh t of the fact that he moves on the country of Egypt and takes spoils. (Dan. 11:42) At this point, Libya and Ethiopia come to the aid of Egypt. It is apparent by this time that since Egypt had br oken the covenant, all bets are off, as the European military force has responded with e xtreme prejudice. This upheaval in diplomacy now creates an unstable condition world)w ide as an aura of war is manifested. Daniel 11:44)45 says: “But tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him: therefore he shall go forth with great fury to destroy, and utterly to make away many. And he shall plant the tabernacles of hi s palace between the seas in the glorious holy mountainC” He will withdraw from Egy pt, killing as many people as he can, before doubling back to Jerusalem. This is the beginning of the end. Abomination of Desolation “When ye therefore shall see the abomination of des olation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place...” (Matthew 2 4:15) “Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be r evealed, the son of perdition; Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that"},{"pageNumber":887,"pageContent":"he is God,” (2 Thessalonians 2:3)4) “And from the time that the daily sacrifice shall b e taken away, and the abomination that maketh desolate set up, there shal l be a thousand two hundred and ninety days.

And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme hi s name, and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven. And it w as given unto him to make war with the saints and to overcome them...” (Revel ation 13:5)7) “I beheld, and the same horn made war with the sain ts, and prevailed against them...” (Daniel 7:21) “Then let them which be in Judea flee into the moun tains.” (Matthew 24:16) “But when ye shall see the abomination of desolatio n, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not, (let him that readeth understand,) then let them that be in Judea flee to the mountains.” (Mark 13:14) “And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days ... And when the dragon saw that he was cast u nto the earth, he persecuteth the woman which brought forth the man c hild. And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she mig ht fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and t imes, and half a time, from the face of the serpent ... And the dragon was wroth wi th the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep t he commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.” (Revelatio n 12:6, 13)17) When the Antichrist reveals himself by defiling the Jewish Temple with a statue of his image, and his demand that he be worshipped as the Messiah; the eyes of the Jewish people will be opened. He will become the mo st dreaded being that ever walked the earth. Revelation 13:2 indicates that “the drag on (Satan) gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority,” and once his Satani c agenda is realized, the Jews will flee Israel to escape his wrath. With the phrase “two wi ngs of a great eagle” it’s possible that an airlift will be mounted to aid the Jews in their escape into the “wilderness.” This area is believed to be the land of Edom, Moab, and Ammon, which will not be overrun by European forces. There in the southern J ordanian wilderness, 180 miles south of the Ammon, and 75 miles north of Aqaba (wh ich is on the Gulf of Aqaba), is a 20)square mile complex known as the ancient city of Petra (a Greek word meaning ‘Rock’). Located in a valley, and surrounded by imp assable sandstone cliffs, the only entrance is a narrow path known as El Ciq, which is about 6,000 feet long, and varies in width from 12 to 30 feet. The sides are part of nea rly perpendicular cliffs which range in"},{"pageNumber":888,"pageContent":"heights from 300 to 500 feet. At the end of the 1¼ mile El Ciq is the Treasury Bu ilding (tomb of Aretas II)  Dwellings in the city of Petra  Roman ruin s in Petra Known as Mount Seir in the Bible, this was the home of Esau, the father of the Edomites (ancestors of the Palestinian Arabs). Duri ng the Babylonian captivity of the Jews, the Edomites moved into Israel, and Petra was inhabited by an Arabic tribe known as the Nabataeans (said to be the descendants of Nebajoth, the oldest son of Ishmael) during the 6th century BC, and became an i mportant trade center. They were defeated by the Romans around 55 BC, and in 32 BC, Marc Antony gave Petra to Cleopatra of Egypt as a gift. Because he was marrie d to Octavia, the sister of Roman Emperor, the Senate stripped him of his rank and or dered him back to Rome. Antony committed suicide in 30 BC, as did Cleopatra later. With the decrease of Roman influence in the 5th century, and after the Islamic invasion during the 7th century, the area became part of the province of Arabia, and rem ained a ghost town until it was rediscovered in 1812 by Swiss explorer John L. Burc khardt. The last segment of the 1989 Paramount movie Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade was filmed at Petra. Believed to have originally been built inside an ex tinct volcano, this rock city contains many elaborate facades among its many structures, w hich include various tombs, monuments, and dwellings, which were carved into th e rock of the mountainside.

Even though it is located in a desert area, there are water cisterns there, and dozens of springs and wells, including the Ain Musa (‘Spring of Moses’), two miles from the entrance, which is traditionally identified as one of the two sites wh ere Moses produced water by striking a rock. At one time this spring had been channeled in to the city. It has been reported that Petra could hold up to a million people. In 1935, out of a $5 million trust fund, Dr. Willia m E. Blackstone sent a group of Christians there with Bibles, printed in Hebrew, wh ich were sealed in copper boxes and buried in hewn)out vaults in the mountain. The Bibl es are marked at the passages which deal with the Antichrist. In recent years, a construction firm out of Minneapolis, Minnesota, had been hired to restore the water syst em; and other international teams were schedules to carry out other restoration work. From this point on is the time referred to as the ‘ Great Tribulation.” Revelation 11:2 says: “...for it is given unto the Gentiles: and th e holy city shall they tread under foot forty and two months (or 3)1/2 years or 1,260 days) .” Although his influence will be worldwide, the Antichrist will have absolute power over 25% of the world (Rev. 6:8), with the main concentration being in the nations of the world controlled by the world government. He will seek out and destroy true Chris tians and all others who will not worship him or take his Mark. In Matthew 24:9, Jesu s said: “Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shal l be hated of all nations for my name’s sake.” Revelation 20:4 talks about those who were “ beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipp ed the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands...” It is at this time when “two witnesses” will emerge to “prophesy,” according to Revelation 11:3. It says, “I will give power unto m y two witnesses,” which could indicate that God intends to anoint a couple of ordinary men , who will become ‘super evangelists,’ possessing extraordinary powers like the prophets of old. However, just as angels have been sent to Earth in various capacitie s, the consensus seems to be that these two will be prophets sent by God. There have been two possibilities mentioned as to t he identities of the two. Matthew 17:3 and Mark 9:4, refer to Jesus being transfigured with Elijah and M oses. In 2 Kings 2:11, the prophet Elijah was taken to heaven in a f iery chariot; and in Malachi 4:5, this prophecy is given: “Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord.” Moses, unlike Elijah, had died, so it was his spiritual body which had appeared. So the identity of the sec ond witness perhaps points to Enoch, because he was the only other person in the Bible who never died. According to Genesis 5:24, he was taken by God. These two witnesses, who will preach for 1,260 days , will most likely have a ministry similar to John the Baptist. They will be latter)da y prophets, opposing the dictatorship and government of the Antichrist, and spreading the word that the Son of Man, Jesus, the true Messiah, is returning the reclaim the Eart h. After their ministry is complete, the Antichrist will succeed in having them killed, and as a warning to others, the Antichrist will demand that their bodies remain unburied, so t he world can see the extent of his power. However, God will show his power, and bring them back to life (3)1/2 days later), and they will be taken back to Heaven.

The line)up of combatants that appears in chapter 3 8 includes the descendents of Japheth (3rd chapter of Genesis), a son of Noah: Go mer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras, who repopulated the Earth after the Flood. Magog’s descendants settled in the area of Armenia, which is in southern Russia, after being driven north through the Caucasus mount ains by the Medes. This race came to be known as the Scythians, and were called ‘Mago gites’ by the Greeks. The Chinese name for the Caucasus mountains running through Rus sia mean ‘Fort of Gog,’ while the Russians call their peaks, the ‘Gogh.’ The Arabic t erm for the Great Wall of China is ‘the wall of Al Magog,’ because it was erected with the intention of keeping out the armies of Magog. Their descendants include the Tarters, Cossa cks, Kalmuks, and the Mongols. The Kesses HaSofer , a Jewish Commentary, indicates that the word ‘Mon gol,’ which identifies the Siberian)Russian people, comes from the word ‘Magog.’ In the Septuagint (Greek) translation of the Bible, it describes ‘Gog’ as the ‘prince of Rosh.’ Rosh was the name of a tribe living in the a rea of the Volga. In some languages, Rosh is the word for the country of Russia. The anc ient form of the name Russia, is ‘Ros.’ The Chinese had called the Scythians ‘Rosh.’ The King James Version translated ‘Rosh’ to mean ‘chief prince,’ because in Hebrew it means ‘head’; but in the Septuagint version, ‘Rosh’ is used as the proper name it is be lieved to be. An interesting fact from the Oxford Paperback Encyc lopedia (from Oxford University Press) is that there is a British legend that ident ifies Gog and Magog as the survivors of a race of giants destroyed by Brutus the Trojan, th e legendary founder of London. They were depicted in statues erected at London’s Guildh all during the reign of Henry V, but were destroyed by the Fire of London in 1666. Recon structed, they were again destroyed during the air raids of the Blitz in 1940 . The current statues were created in 1953. Models of these “gods” are carried through th e streets during the Lord Mayor’s annual procession. No doubt an offshoot of that is the fact that there are two hills called Gog and Magog near Cambridge, in England, where the re are huge drawings in the ground that can only see seen from the air. The descendants of Meshech (known to the Assyrians as ‘Mushku’), settled in western Russia, where they established a city calle d Meshech, later known as Mosach, then Moscovi (Muscovy or Moscow), which is the capi tal of Russia. Tubal’s descendants lived in the area of the Black Sea, then moved north, settling in the eastern part of Russia, establishing the city o f Tobolsk. Their descendants include the Iberians, Georgians, Cappadocians, as well as o ther Asiatic and European peoples. This attack will also include Persia (the descendan ts of Madai, which includes Iran and Iraq), Ethiopia (the descendants of Cush, the s on of Ham, another son of Noah), and Libya (the descendants of Phut, the son of Ham) . Ethiopia and Libya were the nations that came to Egypt’s aid. Since Egypt is no t mentioned, we have to assume that they suffered great destruction. In 1847, Sir Henry Layard discovered the Assyrian c apital city of Nineveh, and the"},{"pageNumber":891,"pageContent":"Royal Palace, which contained over 23,000 clay tabl ets describing all kinds of things. After defeating the Israelites, and taking them cap tive, they were exiled to an area below the Black and Caspian Seas. These reports gav e the names used by the Assyrians for the different groups of Israelites th at were planted as a buffer between them and their enemies (Medes). The “Royal Letters” date back to 707 BC, which is about 14 years after the defeat of Samaria. Letters #1079 (describes the defeat of the Urartians), and its follow)up #197 (which says it o ccurred in the land of Gamir) were written by Sennacherib to his father, King Sargon. Letter #112 talks about a people (Iskuza or Isaac) that “went forth” from the midst of the Mannai, into the “land of Urartu,” while another letter distinctly separates the Urart ians, the Mannai, and the Gamera (or Gimira), which means the people in Letter #112 are Gamerraan, or in English, the ‘Cimmerians.’ The Behistun Rock was found in the 1700)foot high Z argos mountains in northwestern Iran, 300 foot above the ground on a s heer face, The relief had been commissioned by Darius the Great in 515 BC, and lis ts the peoples and nations he defeated and ruled over as part of the Medo)Persian Empire. It is interesting to point out, that while he was putting down the Israelite i nsurrection, he was helping the Jews to rebuild the Temple. Behistun Rock The Rock (confirmed by Darius’ tomb, as well as a g olden tablet that talks about the ‘Sakka’) is inscribed in three languages, is 100 fe et high, and 150 feet wide. By 1840, it had been deciphered by Sir Henry C. Rawlinson. The name ‘Kana’ (Canaan) appears 28 times. ‘Saka’ or ‘Sakka’ in Mede, Persian, Elami te, and ‘Sacae’ in Greek, is ‘Gimri’ in Babylonian. The Assyrian and Babylonian renditions are nearly the same. ‘Sakka’ refers to a nomad or one who lives in a tent or ‘booth.’ T he word ‘booth’ in Hebrew is ‘succoth.’ ‘Sakka’ comes from ‘Isaac,’ (pronounced ‘e)sahk’ wi th emphasis on the last syllable) and became ‘Saxon.’ ‘Gimri’ comes from the Assyrian ‘Khumri’ (after Biblical House of"},{"pageNumber":892,"pageContent":"‘Omri,’ 6th King of Israel) and became Ghumri, Gimi ra, Gimmira, the Greek ‘Kimmeroii,’ or English ‘Cimmerian.’ Henry C. Rawlinson According to the apocryphal book of 2 Esdras 13:40) 44, they migrated to Europe. While the main body of prisoners remained in the ar ea about a hundred years, the Israelites slowly began moving to the east and the north. When the power of the Assyrians was broken, there were several migrations , with the two main groups moving west under the Black Sea, north through the Dariel Pass of the Caucasas Mountains into the steppes of southern Russia. A large group also migrated east. Between 650)500 BC, the Cimmerians in Europe moved up the Danube and became known as Celts, eventually migrating to Fran ce than England. Between 250) 100 BC, when southern Russia was invaded by the Sar matians from the east, the Scythians (Isaac is believed to be the foundation f or this name) were driven northwest through Poland into Germany. After 450 AD, the Roma ns called the Scythians ‘Germans,’ meaning ‘genuine,’ to distinguish them f rom the Sarmatians in Scythia. So, Gomer’s desecendants (known to the Assyrians as ‘Gimirrai’ or ‘Cimmerians’) settled in central Asia Minor, north of the Black S ea, in southern Russia, then moved west along the Danube River, to the area now known as Germany. He was the father of Eastern Europe. Old world maps identify this area a s Gomer, Gomerlunt, Gomeria. Their descendants include the Galatians, Phrygians, Gauls, Celts (Greek “Keltoi”), Germans, French, Welsh, Irish, Britons, and other A nglo)Saxon (means ‘Isaac’s son’) peoples. In addition, Togarmah (known to the Assyri ans as ‘Tilgarimmu’), a son of Gomer, is singled out. His descendants occupied Tur key and Asia Minor, and another branch settled in Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, w hich were later taken over by the Soviet Union. They were granted independence in Sep tember, 1991. Togarmah’s ‘bands’ could also refer to Armenia and Syia, whose ancestors claimed that Haik, the father of their race, was the son of Togarmah. The descendants of another son of Gomer, Ashkenaz, settled in Germany and Austria."},{"pageNumber":893,"pageContent":"In Ezekiel 38:13, “Sheba, Dedan, and the merchants of Tarshish, with all the young lions thereof,” seem to be questioning the motives of the Soviet Union, perhaps because they seem far removed from what appears to be a regional conflict. It is not clear whether they involve themselves in the milita ry action. Sheba (also Saba), was an ancient kingdom in the ar ea of the southwestern edge of Saudi Arabia which became known as the British colo ny of Aden, until achieving independence as South Yemen (who united with North Yemen in 1990). This was the traditional kingdom of the Queen of Sheba who ruled over the Sabaeans (who dominated all of southern Arabia), and was labeled in Matthew 12:42 as the ‘Queen of the South.’ The historian Josephus referred to her as the “Queen of Egypt and Ethiopia.” Dedan was the name of a Sabaean oasis in the northern part of Saudi Arabia, which was one of their many colonies in northern Ar abia. Another identifying indication again comes from Bib lical genealogy. Cush, the son of Ham, was the father of Ethiopia, and other tribes w ho settled south of Egypt, in Arabia, Babylonia and India. Cush’s sons are identified as Seba (who in Psalms 72:10 is associated with the kings of Sheba, and in Isaiah 4 3:3 are mentioned with Ethiopia, which indicates that he is the father of the Sabaea ns); Havilah (a name associated with the area of the Sinai and northwestern Arabia); Sab tah, Raamah, and Sabtechah (all three of which were associated with tribes in south ern Arabia). Sheba and Dedan are listed as sons of Raamah. Thus, the reference to Sh eba and Dedan actually identifies the country of Saudi Arabia (as well as the countri es of Oman, Yemen, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, and Bahrain). They were an ally of the Coalition against Iraq during the Gulf War. The “merchants of Tarshish, with all the young lion s thereof” are also named with them. According to Jeremiah 10:9, Tarshish is iden tified as a land rich with precious metals; and in other passages, such as Isaiah 2:16, are associated with possessing a prominent shipping empire which was used to export goods to places all over the Mediterranean. Some researchers have tried to conne ct Tarshish with Tartessus (located in the Guadalquivir Valley) in southwester n Spain, where the Phoenicians founded colonies to capitalize on the wealth of min erals found there. The Phoenicians established the city of Carthage on Africa’s northern coast (in what is now Tunisia), and it was these Carthaginians who began colonizing Spain in 654 BC (until they were driven out by the Romans in 206 BC ), and exploring the Atlantic coastline from western Africa to Britain. Recent ar chaeological evidence has shown that they possessed sailing capabilities far beyond what was originally known. An inscription discovered in 1780 on a cliff above Mount Hope Bay in Bristol, Rhode Island, which was written in Tartessian Punic, reads: “Voyagers from Tarshish this stone proclaims.” It is believed that this inscription was made about 533 B C. Howard University’s Dept. of Archaeology has found five other areas in the Unite d States where Tarshish had colonies 2500 years ago. Tarshish was a great)grandson of Noah, whose descen dants migrated to the areas which later became Spain and Great Britain. Ezekiel 27:12 indicates that Tarshish was a source of tin, and the word ‘Britain’ means “land of tin.” Both Spain, with their Armada, and England, became major naval powers. An analysis of these facts may indicate that Tarshish is referring to one (England) or two count ries of the western European alliance. The “young lions” (the lion is a symbol of England) could refer to the United States (who"},{"pageNumber":894,"pageContent":"came out of England), Canada, Australia, New Zealan d (all part of the English Empire), their possessions and allies. Again, we can’t be su re if these countries that are mentioned are participants in this massive assault. In Revelation 16:12, the 6th angel pours out his vi al, which causes the Euphrates River to dry up, so “that the way of the kings of t he east might be prepared,” and then in Rev. 9:16 we find that “the number of the army of t he horsemen were two hundred thousand thousandC” We can connect these two verse s together by virtue of numbers and geography. An estimate made in April, 1961, said that there “w ere 200 million armed and organized militiamen” in China. The Associated Pres s reported that one out of every five in China have had military training. Premier Mao Ts e)tung publicly boasted the fact that China could field an army of 200 million. A Chinese documentary called Voice of the Dragon revealed that China could produce a military force of 200 million. In an Associated Press article by John A. Hightower, on A pril 28, 1964, he said: “The documents (secret Chinese military plans) make clea r that the Red Chinese leaders believe that they cannot be defeated by long range nuclear missiles, such as U.S. missiles, and if they invaded, they could rely on t heir vast military manpower.” To comprehend a number this large, bear in mind that t he population of the United States is about to 295,000,000. Napoleon said: “Let China sleep, for when China awa kes, let the nations tremble.” In 1953, Premier Mao Tse)tung (who in 1921 founded Chi na’s Communist Party) said: “Members of the Chinese Communist Party do not take second place to the members of any Communist Party in the world.” China is the las t bastion of Communist domination, and they likewise will join the fray in a quest for world domination. Napoleon Bonaparte The government of Pakistan, with the help of 12,000 Chinese soldiers, constructed the 549 mile Karakoram superhighway, which had been nicknamed the “roof on top of the world.” Starting in Tibet, it weaves its way th rough the province of Singkiang; the mountains peaks of Manchuria, Mongolia, Nepal, the Himalayas, West Pakistan; and into Afghanistan, to where the Euphrates River rise s in Turkey, and runs across Syria.

It could be done through supernatural mea ns, as has happened with the Red Sea and the Jordan River (Exodus 14:13)22, Josh ua 3:4, 2 Kings 2:8, 14); or it could be the result of manipulation. There are two dams in the Turkish section of the Euphrates, Ataturk and Karakaya. In 1974, Soviet en gineers built the Keban dam, and in 1975, built another at Tabka, in Syria. In Janua ry, 1990, Turkey began the operation of a dam that caused the river to fall 75% in one d ay. So, it is quite possible that the river could be made to dry up at just the right tim e. Okay, take a deep breath. We have the armies of the Antichrist hunkering down in Israel, we have the Soviet Union and countries of E astern Europe (perhaps Albania, Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine, and Yugoslavia) coming down from the north, we have Iraq and Iran coming from the East, we have China coming from the Far East, and we have Ethiopia and Libya coming from the South.

There is a hint here that Satanic in spiration will be used to marshal the coming military forces into a cohesive unit that wi ll be arrayed against Christ himself. This place this will happen at is identified: “And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon.” Armageddon is a combination of the two Hebrew words ‘har’ and ‘magedon,’ which roughly tra nslated, means the ‘mount of Megiddo.’ It is located on a 300 square mile area o n the south side of the valley of Megiddo, or the Plain of Esdraelon (Jezreel), south east of Mt. Carmel, which extends to the Jordan Valley. Megiddo, which stood at the entr ance of a pass across the Carmel mountain range, was the capital of the area of Cana an when it was attacked by Joshua. The port city of Haifa is located at the Valley’s w estern entrance, and no doubt will be utilized as the drop)off point for troops who are t ransported by naval vessels. While this area is identified as the area where the armies of the world gather, Joel 3:2, 12, 14, pinpoints the battle area as the valley of Jehoshap hat, which was known as the “valley of decision” and according to tradition is believed to be located near Jerusalem, in the Kidron valley.

The heat from this blast was 127,200,000 degrees Fahren heit, or three times hotter than the center of the sun. Although the 20 kiloton explosio n affected only a four square mile area, its intensity killed 50,000 people, and wound ed another 55,000, On August 9, 1945, the second bomb, was dropped on Nagasaki, and people ten miles away were paralyzed, and even those with only slight wounds, eventually died. President Harry Truman said: “The force from which the sun draws it s power has been loosed against those who brought war to the Far East.” In 1953, a movie was produced which recorded the results of “Operation Ivy,” a military test of a hydrogen bomb detonation in the Pacific which took place in November, 1952.

Aftermath of Hiroshima explosion "},{"pageNumber":898,"pageContent":" Nagasaki explosion The concentration of the use of nuclear weapons in such a small area could possibly throw the Earth off of its axis– producing disastro us results. An article in the September, 1975 edition of Smithsonian magazine said: “Astronomical theories that attribu te climate changes to shifts in the Earth’s orbit or rotation on its axis; solar theories that propose that the Earth’s climate varies in response to chan ged in the activity of the sun; and geophysical theories that link climatic changes to events and interactions within the land)ocean)atmosphere...” These theories seem to be corroborated by events described in the book of Genesis. When the Earth was created, the weather was always clear and sunny. There was never any rain. The vegetation was watered by the m orning dew, which was why the people scoffed when Noah warned of an impending flo od– because they didn’t know what rain was. The pre)Flood calendar was a perfect year of 12 months, with 30 days in each month. Now we have 365 a days in a year. Accor ding to scientists, the reason for this is that the Earth has been moved away from the sun by a million miles, resulting in 2% less heat; and the tilt of the axis is now 23)1/ 2 degrees, which accounts for the harshness of the seasons. The magnetic field was al so changed. This upsetting of the delicate balances of nature has been blamed for the reduction of the human life span. Methuselah lived to be 969 years old, while Moses l ived only to be 120. The movement of the Earth off of its axis would ini tiate earthquakes, and volcanic activity; affecting the topography of the Earth, an d the poisoning of the waters. In addition, the volcanic activity, because its ash, s moke and dust tend to stay in the air for long periods of time, will screen out the light of the sun, as well as the moon and stars. Radioactive particles and the igniting of sulfur de posits (brimstone) will poison the air. Will God allow the possibility of such a devastatio n to take place– apparently not. It appears that there will be a preemptive first strik e.

For the g reat day of his wrath is come: and who shall be able to stand?” (Revelation 6:12)1 7) According to Revelation 11:13, within the hour afte r the two witnesses leave the earth, a massive earthquake will occur. This same e arthquake is referred to in Zechariah 14:4, as Jesus returns to this world at the same point he left it, on the Mount of Olives, a small range of four summits which over look Jerusalem from the east. The earthquake is again mentioned in Revelation 16:18)2 1: “And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there was a great ear thquake ... And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found. And there f ell upon men a great hail out of heaven, every stone about the weight of a talent (1 14 pounds)...” It is interesting to note, that when Jesus died on the cross, there was “darkness over all the land” and “the earth did quake, and the roc ks rent (Matthew 27:45, 51).” The 18th century scientist von Hoff wrote: “There have been strange colorings of the heavens and unusual fogs noticed as occurring at the same t ime of earthquakes; such as the unusual color of the sky at Lisbon on the first of November, 1755, and the dry fog"},{"pageNumber":900,"pageContent":"(Nebel), which was so thick as to produce total dar kness during the earthquake in Calabria in 1783.” In Revelation 19:11, John writes about this moment: “And I saw heaven open and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war.” The ride r is none other than Jesus, the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords. He is followed by an army of angels. Verse 19 describes the reception waiting below: “And I saw t he beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war aga inst him that sat on the horse, and against his army.” Ezekiel’s description of “the fire of my wrath,” (3 8:19) “a great shaking,” (38:19) “an overflowing rain, and great hailstones, fire, and b rimstone,” (38:22) “I will send a fire,” (39:6) certainly paints a picture that will be very similar to the destruction meted out by God at Sodom and Gomorrah. This event, which occurred about 1897 BC, and is di scussed in Genesis 19:24)29: “Then the Lord rained upon Sodom and Gomorrah brims tone and fire from the Lord out of heaven; And he overthrew those cities, and all t he plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground ... and , lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.” In 1924, a joint expedition of archaeologists W. F. Albright and Mervyn G. Kyle, from the American School and Xenia Seminary, discovered five oases, on a plain, 500 feet above the level of the southeast corner of the Dead Sea in the Moabite foothills. Evidence of a walled area was discovered at Bab)Edh Dra’a (Bab edh)Dhra) in 1965, part of a fortification built by the Canaanites dur ing the time of Abraham; and from 1975) 79, excavations of pots and other items were uneart hed, which dated back to 2500 to 2000 BC. Four other sites have been identified on t he east side of the Dead Sea as part of the ruins of the five plain cities involved in t he turn of events, including Numeira (discovered in 1973), Safi (identified as Zoar), Fe ifa, and Hanazir. Because of evidence which proves that the area was fertile and densely populated, all of these sites, along with Sodom and Gomorrah, are believed to be the fiv e cities of the plain. Excavations made since 1974 at the Tell Mardikh, site of the an cient Ebla, in northern Syria, have turned up tablets from their archives which refer t o all five cities of the plain, and on one, even names them in the same sequence as in Genesis 14:2. Nelson Glueck, while Director of the American Schoo l of Oriental Research in Jerusalem (1932)39), made a survey of the southern Transjordan area, east and south of the Dead Sea, and discovered that the area had b een settled before 2000 BC, but suddenly had been abandoned. These cities were loca ted at the Vale of Siddim, at the southern end of the Dead Sea in the Great Rift Vall ey, which extends from Mount Hermon and the Sea of Galilee in the north, as far south as the Gulf of Aquaba, and includes the Jordan Valley and the Dead Sea region. It is part of a huge fracture in the Earth’s crust that begins several hundred miles nor th at the foot of the Taurus Mountains in Asia Minor, and ends beyond the Red Se a in Africa. It is 1,320 feet below the level of the Mediterranean Sea. The Dead Sea, between Israel and Jordan, is the low est spot on the Earth’s surface, and is fed by the Jordan River. Without an outlet, the water has evaporated for hundreds of years, leaving behind a variety of mine rals, including sodium chloride, potassium chloride, magnesium bromine, magnesium ch loride and hydrogen sulfide. As"},{"pageNumber":901,"pageContent":"the name suggests, fish cannot live in its waters. Along the southern end of the Dead Sea is a ten mile mass of salt called Jebel Usdim ( Arabic for ‘mountains of Sodom’). The salt at its base is 150 feet deep in places, an d geologists have also indicated the presence of sulphur, natural gas, oil, and bitumen. The “slimepits” mentioned in Genesis 14:10, refer to the bitumen, asphalt or pitch, a lu strous black petroleum product which melts and burns. There are vast beds of it on both sides of the Sea, with heavier concentrations at the southern end. The Nabataeans collected the bitumen which floated to the surface for trade. The southern half of the Dead Sea seems relatively new, and is much shallower than the northern half, which is 1,296 feet deep. I t had been written that the ruins were still visible until the first century; and there we re even later reports that when the sun was shining in the right direction, the outline of trees were visible under the surface of the water, preserved by the high salt content of th e water. These stories were not confirmed by divers, who found no sign of human set tlements. However, regardless of any hard evidence, enough circumstantial evidence e xists which indicated that the southern end of the Dead Sea was the location of th e destruction. It has been theorized that an earthquake ignited th e natural gas deposits, which created a violent explosion, and propelled a mixtur e of salt, sulphur and bitumen into the air, literally raining fire and brimstone, as the o il basin beneath the cities burned. Some have even gone as far as saying that God leveled th e area with an atomic blast. It appears, that from all descriptions, hell will b e unleashed. The very power of the elements themselves will be turned upon the encroac hing army. During the U.S. hydrogen bomb tests on the Marshall Islands, an analysis of the results indicated, that there were also hailstones. The blast caused a tremendous air turbulence to develop, which in turn caused the for mation of hailstones large enough to dent the armor plating on surface ships.

The synthetic resin used to bond the layers of wood together unde r high pressure burns brightly with intense heat, thus making it easier for the weapons to be burned. This is another one of those pesky little end)time rumors that seem to be so pervasive. A little research bears out the fact tha t there is no military equipment produced with this material, only electrotechnical materials, sportsgear, industrial supplies, wooden mallets, furniture, and a few othe r things. Besides, if the stuff burns so easily, who would want to be on a battlefield in a vehicle which can be ignited so easily. The Millenial Kingdom Jesus will then establish his kingdom on this Earth (Joel 3:17), and restoration of this area will begin. The earthquake which caused the Mo unt of Olives to split (Zech. 14:4), will produce a waterway to issue forth from under t he Temple, which will split into two separate rivers south of Jerusalem (Ez. 47:1)12, Jo el 3:18, Zech. 14:8); one going to the Mediterranean, and the other to the Dead Sea. T his will cleanse the waters of the Dead Sea, and enable it to support life; and will c hange the desert on the eastern slope of Israel’s mountains into fertile land (Deut. 30:9 ). On July 11, 1927, there was an earthquake that shoo k Palestine from the Sea of Galilee to the border of Egypt. Afterward, geologis ts discovered a fault line at the Mount of Olives running east to west. Professor Bailey Wi llis, of Stanford University, said that because of the fault, the area around Jerusalem cou ld expect to experience seismic disturbances because of the slippage that would occ ur on the fault the runs under the Mount. Israel will take possession of the land promised t o them in Genesis 15:18. The country of Israel will extend from the Nile to the Euphrates River, and include parts of Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, and Jordan; and from the Red Sea, to almost the Black Sea. “And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and jud gment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the b east, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.” (R evelation 20:4) "},{"pageNumber":904,"pageContent":"AFTERWORD When I began this odyssey in 1978, I never really u nderstood the fervency that was put within me. To be quite frank, although I had be en taken to church from a young age, at that time I was not even living for the Lord. Ye t, I found myself totally consumed and driven in my search for knowledge about an organiza tion through which Bible prophecy was being fulfilled. Most people who don’t consider themselves a Christian, generally don’t spend all of their free time working on a man uscript about a group whose is paving the way for the coming of the Antichrist. But I gue ss because of the years that I did spend in Church, God had instilled something in me, which I didn’t know was there. When I was 2)1/2 years old, I was hit by a car, and suffered a fractured skull. When I was 29 years old, my appendix ruptured, but because of a misdiagnosis, I was not operated on till the next day. Afterward, someone s aid to me that people have sometimes died within the hour of an appendix burst ing. Without a doubt, God had His hand on me. He had spared me for some reason– for s ome purpose. I began to realize that I had a destiny to fulfill. After Final Warning was initially published in 1994, God really began working on me. With all the doors that opened, it wasn’t hard to s ee His hand at work. On April 14, 1996, I got down on my knees and gave my heart to t he Lord. My wife was always trying to get me to go to Church , but I was always too busy doing things. One day she said that the Church was having a special service that Saturday, that there was going to be a prophetess t here. Whoa, Nelly! A prophetess? Listen, I grew up in a spirit)filled church, and I was accustomed to God speaking to the Church through the gift of tongues. But a prophetes s– c’mon. That’s Old Testament stuff. God doesn’t speak through people anymore. We ll, I agreed to go anyway. But I was going as a skeptic. After the prophetess was finished ministering to th e church, she began to have people stand up, and she was saying things to them. To be quite honest, being that I was skeptical; I wasn’t even paying attention to wh at was going on. But then all of a sudden, she asked my wife and I to stand up. Uh oh. In part, this is what she said to me: “There’s a day of rebuilding the wall that has been broken down C We’re rebuilding the wall like Nehemiah rebuilt the wall C the rebuilding of some things that were torn down, that you might know that my pl an still lives and that my vision still remains C There’s a rebuilding of the wall, for once it’s built, I’m going to show you how to be a watchman upon that wall C S on, that you might stand tall, knowing that I have appointed you, and I have called you; let me recommission youC” Now, you have to realize that this lady did not kno w me, neither did the pastors. When I you a young boy, I was told on two occasions (that I can remember), that I was going to grow up to be a preacher. The only one who knew that was my mother. As I stood there weeping, I knew that I had truly receiv ed a Word from the Lord. To say that this moment was a turning point in my life, is an u nderstatement. My destiny had been revealed to me in a very powerful way."},{"pageNumber":905,"pageContent":"I started to become very frustrated in my efforts t o get Final Warning printed by a larger publisher who would have the distribution ca pabilities to market it to a much wider audience. One Sunday morning (March 1, 1998) I got up early to pray, and I said to the Lord that if there was a work He wanted me to do, H e would have to give me the tools to do it. Two days later, a brother walked up to me after the Church service and said: “God told me to give you my computer.” Earlier, tha t same night, the guest minister gave me this Word from the Lord: “You accurately discerned that the call of God is upon your life. You accurately discerned that there was a future with me. You accu rately discerned that the time would come that you would have to serve me, and tha t you would have to step outC” My friend from church brought the computer to my ho use that Saturday and set it up. The night before, our guest minister gave me the fo llowing Word from the Lord: “There’s going to be a day, a time, an hour, that y ou will have to walk out of where you now stand. You will have to take a step o f faith and you will enter into the land. For I will touch your tongue with heaven’ s fire, and you will preach with a holy desire C Is this not what you’ve asked of me to do for you this day C Now therefore, hear the word of the Lord, I am going to grant to you the sword. For you have had it in your sheath too longC” The Lord equipped me, anointed me, and gave me marc hing orders. Oh yes, and He gave me a lot of grace too, because now I had a com puter, and I didn’t even know how to use a mouse. For the next eight months I read bo oks, studied manuals, and made many mistakes; but on November 24, 1998, my website went online for the first time, featuring the online version of my book Final Warning – for the entire world to read. I am honored and I am humbled to be able to use my talents, skills and abilities to serve my God, and I have taken my role as a ‘watchm an of the wall’ very seriously. Ezekiel 33:2)9 tells us what our responsibility is as a watchman: “Son of man, speak to the children of thy people, a nd say unto them, When I bring the sword upon a land, if the people of the l and take a man of their coasts, and set him for their watchman: If when he seeth th e sword come upon the land, he blow the trumpet, and warn the people; Then whos oever heareth the sound of the trumpet, and taketh not warning; if the sword c ome, and take him away, his blood shall be upon his own head. He heard the sou nd of the trumpet, and took not warning; his blood shall be upon him. But he th at taketh warning shall deliver his soul. But if the watchman see the sword come, a nd blow not the trumpet, and the people be not warned; if the sword come, and ta ke any person from among them, he is taken away in his iniquity; but his blo od will I require at the watchman's hand. So thou, O son of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel; therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth, and warn them from me. When I say unto the wicked, O wicked man, thou shalt surely die; if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way , that wicked man shall die in"},{"pageNumber":906,"pageContent":"his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand. Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it; if he do not turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.” This has been such an incredible year of getting wo rk done on my house, getting rid of stuff, and reorganizing things. Through it all, the word “positioning” continued to come to me. This year, I began to have more people visit ing my website, and all of a sudden, in June, many people wanted copies of Final Warning . Four months later, God opened up a door for it to get published. Our God is an aw esome God! I am determined to walk in the destiny that God has planned and purposed for my life. Right now, I don’t know where that destiny ma y lead, but I have committed to go where He leads. Because I have gotten my book publ ished, some people where I work have joked about me becoming famous. Well, I don’t know if God has destined me for greatness, but I do know that He has destined to us e me greatly.

Death will come to he who speaks. We will keep their lifespan short and their minds w eak while pretending to do the opposite.

The poisons will be absorbed through their skin and mouths, and they will destroy their minds and reproductive systems. From all this, their children will be born dead, an d we will conceal this information. The poisons will be hidden in everything that surro unds them, in what they drink, eat, breathe and wear.

I have no fear in what man can do to me, because through Christ, I am more tha n a conqueror. I am an overcomer and I can do all things through Christ who strength ens me. It is not important that I be the best, only that I do my best. Without Him I am nothing, with Him I am everything. Champions are not men who never fail, they are men who never quit. Remember, it's hard to beat a person wh o never gives up. Expect to win. I am a winner and I will walk in victory, because I h ave put my trust in God. He is my Deliverance and my Salvation.
