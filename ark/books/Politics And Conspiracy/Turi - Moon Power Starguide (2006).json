A special thanks to George Noory Coat To Coast radio Host and the numerous open-minded people I known, friends, journalists and worldwide hosts of radio and television programs.

I appreciate all those souls who have guided and supported my work. In their common efforts to fur - ther the truth they all are vital participants in the understanding of the human ex - perience. All of you have been invaluable in furthering the truth, and I am infinitely grateful for allowing me to pass on my celestial message to the world."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"My Story Dreamer, Slacker, Head in the Clouds, Stargazer, I am sure that we have all heard those terms, but none rang so clear in my head as “Stargazer.” I am not in the strictest sense of the word a Stargazer but I do read the messages that they have left indelibly across men’s souls. Now, I did not start out in life with this in - tent. No way, I was going to be a big rock-and-roll star. That’s right. I went to the Royal School of Music and began the long process of mastering the piano. My teacher said that I would be great but you never believe that kind of thing un - til it actually happens. I still had to work to pay for my studies and I worked hard as a barman for a prestigious hotel. This job suited me well; I was young and full of life and I got to meet new people all the time and make just enough money to pay for my studies and a pint of lager at the end of the day. But when I wasn’t working, I practiced my piano until my fingers bled. All the while wishing I still had my guitar, but a gang that hung out in the Victoria Station metro after dark had stolen it from me. These days in 1974 were very hard and surviving was my full time job then. In my new book “You Are God” all my peripheries and incred- ible experiences are divulged and I am sure, barely believable for some of my readers. This book is in the process of being turned into a movie. Please join my newsletter to find out all about my life and busy career. Before I was able to get a job and a piano teacher, I had to survive in a new coun- try I did not speak the language, and being a Frenchman, English was a real twist. So I started out in the tubes singing French songs and making a few pence a day to able to eat. Incidentally, my first English words came to me as I went shopping for my first dinner. I scanned the shelves in the store until I found the cheapest thing that I could. It came out of a can and was cold and crunchy but it filled my belly. After eating, I got out my little French-to-English dictionary and looked up to words, “Dog” and “Food.” You can imagine my disgust when I found out what this meant, but I was lucky I got to eat that day. When there was a lull in the metro I would run up the steps and be right at Victoria Station, a huge and busy place with a whole bank of telephones. I would run up and down, listening for someone who spoke my native tongue. I finally found a Swiss man who spoke both English and French who gave me a job in the hotel. I started out as a janitor and moved up to dishwasher and finally to barman after much work. I was to stay in England for almost ten years as I worked and studied my music. Finally, I graduated at the top of my class ahead of four hundreds stu - dents earning the prized “Distinction Cup” and commendation from some far - away Royal family members. This led me to a deal, not a good deal but still a"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"deal with Phillips Phonogram records in my own country in France. I produced several records and then went back to home to promote them for a while, glad to leave the harsh English weather behind. Incredible experiences breed incred - ible people and for many years I was reluctant to even mention the following; not knowing more was to happen to me later on in my life. But I am the truth and all that I promote is the future and why shouldn’t I share the incredible with others? In the name of fear, ignorance or jealousy, I also quickly realized that the world was not exactly ready for my incredible experiences and me. After all a magnet will not attract a piece of wood, I deal with the future, promote and explore the future, thus things from the future are a part of my life and my incredible experi - ences with UFO are very real. In those days, my older brother Georges owned a discotheque at the time called L’Interdit or The Forbidden. It was quite the hot spot, and he asked me to come and do my songs there. I gladly accepted the invitation and we left his farmhouse about forty-five minutes from his place about 9:00 p.m. While driving through the deserted roads by the vineyards in a cold November night in 1981, I saw lights flashing out in the vineyards and remarked to my brother that there were people in the vineyards harvesting. He looked at like I had lost my mind, “Louis,” he said, “its November, all the grapes have been picked a long time ago!” I then watched the lights come closer and closer until our car was bathed in light so bright that we could not see, and my brother’s brand-new Mercedes stalled right there in the middle of the road and would not restart. We both had our noses to the windscreen trying to see this thing in the air. It was showering us in light, but it was still too bright. I got out of the car, and then the lights dimmed down in the car, with my brother still in it. This left him scared to death, and me outside swathed in a reddish pink light with a pleasing glow, that came from none other than a Spaceship or UFO suspended about thirty feet above our heads It stayed there for at least five minutes, and it made a slight humming sound. It was beautiful, with multi-colored lights all around it that couldn’t be seen, while its two main bright white headlights were on. It just hung there in the sky for our viewing pleasure just out of reach. We stared in awe, me banging on the car, yelling and cursing for all I was worth for my brother to get out of the car, but he wouldn’t. So much for being a big bad guy is he? Big brothers, what do you expect! Finally, it just flew away, careless as you please and we watched as it picked up speed and disappeared. When I got back into the car, my brother swore me to secrecy that “We would never tell anyone about this ever!” When we arrived at the disco that night everything was in full swing. This is very strange because we should have arrived with the crew who was opening; looking back I would say that we had a missing-in-time thing hap - pen, but we didn’t know anything about that back then, just that it was really strange. 6 Moonpower Stargate 2006"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"The next day, my mother called me and asked if my brother was okay. I laughed, remembering the secrecy deal and assured my mom everything was fine. Which it was, but my soul had somehow changed and I began to think that there was more to life than singing and making records. Maybe I could make a greater con - tribution, I didn’t know what yet, but I wanted something. It didn’t take me long to get the wanderlust again, and I was off to America. With a dream in my heart just a few short years before, I had written a song about this great land. Now I was going. I didn’t know anybody and didn’t have any money, because it turns out my contract had my music playing everywhere in Europe except my own country, and I couldn’t collect my share. Oh, the trials of youth! But I had high hopes and a business card from a man I met in London who said, “Come to America, I will help you start a new life!” I arrived in Los Angeles, the City of Angels, smoggy and yucky, caught a Grey - hound bus to San Diego, gorgeous and green got out my little wallet with fifty dollars and the business card searching for the business on Garnet Avenue in Pacific Beach, California. I am still looking for this man and his business. Dis- heartened, I took thirty of my precious dollars and paid for a motel for the night, and then went to a bar up the street. I ordered a drink and then went to the ciga- rette machine. Weird thing never saw one of those before, I couldn’t figure out how to work it. So I asked a man at the end of the bar if he could help me out. He looked at me funny for a minute or two and then showed me how it worked. Later he told me why the odd gaze; he thought I was gay and that this was a come-on! This man’s name is John Steward and he became one of my best friends. We got drunk and found two beautiful girls soon after, what a start! I thought I might as well, didn’t know what the future would hold, but I still held a shiny bit of enthusiasm in my soul. Sadly enough, years later after an accident, fate turned him from a very wealthy attorney, into a homeless. I had predicted this for him in Hawaii, upon one of his numerous visits. Life’s experiences are dramatic in nature and when the moon resides in a water sign, usually the past, guilt and depression follow. That’s why I decided to write this book annually to help those in need to face their challenges. I had begun to learn the ways of the great Cosmic Clock then and knew that I ar - rived on American soil during a great trend! When I awoke the next morning, I went up the street with my suitcase in one hand and a purse in the other. In France it is customary for men to carry purses. This may be another reason why John looked at me funny, as that is definitely not the custom here. I smelt the ocean and took off in that direction; the waves crashing against the shore were soothing to my nerves, but seeing the girls wearing tops was more culture shock for me. I spent another dollar or two of my precious money getting a cup of cof - fee and then grabbed a newspaper, The La Jolla Light. I needed a place to stay and found a section called “Roommates.” There was a great ad for a beautiful My Story 7"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"house on the ocean in La Jolla with a telephone number and an address. I called the lady up and told her that I was on my way. When I arrived with my suitcase, she remarked how fast and eager I was, with a worried look on her face. She then explained that with two more guys like me, we would all be able to af - ford a beautiful home on the sea. Wow, new word for me, roommate. I explained my situation and she felt sorry for me, and said I could stay with her and tutor her daughter in French. Housing settled for the moment, I went to find a job. Up the street, I ran into a little restaurant called, “The French Gourmet.” Soon I had my first job in America, washing dishes, not glamorous, but a job. Nice guy, my boss then, Michel Malecot. I worked for him for four years, laboring my way to general manager. I also soon moved into my very own apartment and in every spare minute I read and studied my new obsession: Astrology. I inhaled books and knowledge everywhere from the bible to heavy metaphysics. I even painted the apartment that Michel gave me to oversee his catering de - partment with my own astrological chart, the human body and which sign rules each part, as well as other pictures with UFOs prevalent in the bringing of knowledge. As I read, I continually went back to the books about Nostradamus and his works, as well as the books that the great man himself had written. He had a particular way of interpreting the stars that echoed down the valleys of my soul, totally free of mathematical jargon. His methods made much more sense than the other mathematical processes in every way, especially when the great Prophet did not have the luxury of a computer or even a watch then. I dedicated myself to his method for many years, and learned and learned, and then seemed to channel knowledge from the universe itself. When Michel came to collect his rent the first month and found his beautiful apartment all painted, you can imag- ine his shock, but I sat him down and said, “I want to give you a reading.” He was my first client! He is still a client today and one of my best friends in the US. I began to tell people about my passion and people began to come for read - ings. I had stopped working for Michel; I couldn’t take the stress any longer. I went back to working in engineering, welding and heavy equipment, skills I had learned as a young boy from my stepfather. I worked on San Diego US base then Pearl Harbor in Hawaii then in 1991 my entire life changed following the ulti - mate UFO encounter with my ex-wife Brigitte. I painted my entire house with UFO drawings and astrological symbols and I could not stop reading and re-kindly the great Nostradamus’ Divine Astrology methodology. Years later with thousands of satisfied clients in all walks of life and hundreds of successful predictions I am still trying hard to further man’s cosmic conscious - ness and sharpen his intuition by making obvious statements and premonitions in predictive astrology. Some of these were the destruction of the WTC in New York, the fall of Saddam Hussein, SARS break out, the Washington sniper, earth - quakes, disasters, NASA failures and the Asia tsunami etc. Note also that the printing process in all my previous books make those premonitions totally unarguable. 8 Moonpower Stargate 2006"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Letter From the Author 2006: Happy New Year to all 6/25/2005 Dear Clients and Friends: One more year has gone and 2006 is already here. The loss of my great friend and student Dave from Las Vegas was a terrible blow but surely it has been an in- credibly difficult year for many other people. After a terrible heartache and two years to recuperate love entered my life again but for only a short period of time. Everything was against us in this relationship and while traveling in the UK she simply decided to move on. Well its was her decision to let me go and I collected my shattered heart again as to pay some old karma for the emotional pain I in- flicted the many pretty girls of my past. The war is still raging and as predicted in previous Starguide many young people lost their lives. Most of the world’s population is undergoing a reevaluation of its religious, philosophical and spiritual values; especially following the July 7 th sur - prise attack in the London and the September 11th WTC destruction by reli - gious fanatics from the Middle East and Saddam Hussein regime as predicted a two year earlier is now completely dead. The tsunami disaster in Asia also made us aware how powerful Mother Nature really is and how vulnerable we all are. America is a great country but also a very young religious country going through metamorphosis where rules of the past do not apply any longer for the populations of the future. Back home in France we had our one hundred year religious war where Protes - tants and Catholics alike in the name of ignorance, made it a full time job killing one another. Blame it all on deadly Pluto ruler of Scorpio (death/terrorism) go - ing through the sign of Sagittarius (foreigners/religions) forcing the world to rise to a higher level of awareness."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"“Only two things are infinite, the universe and human stupidity, and I’m not sure about the former.” — Albert Einstein Many God fearing people were forced to realize that a bunch of religious luna - tics from abroad, in the name of their own respective religion would cross the ocean and blew up trains in Spain, buses in London and fly planes into the twin towers in New York. Many are quick to judge the Muslims and their fanatic reli - gious views but can the gullible Christians of this country auto analyze them - selves and finally realize that any and all religions is a cancer to mankind spiritual growth. Allah, Buddha and Jesus are the leaders of the youngest and deadliest religions mankind’s folly created by turning centuries of myths into a deceiving reality. None of those deities brought peace and harmony to this unsafe world but differences leading to continuous deadly religious wars. Love and most of all education of man’s relationships with the Universal Mind will change this world, not religion. As long as one is committed to the idea that the stars are something above the head, they will lack the eye of knowledge. (Fredrick Nietzsche) In some ways, all those dramatic predicaments with religion and terrorism we all suffer are a form of wake up call to humankind, in respect to the promotion of any and all archaic beliefs. But the world is still young and the war is also taking place above in the haven as Uranus (the future, the US, technology, New Age) confronts Neptune (Middle-East, the past, religions, imagination, oil). More shocking news are ahead of us and are produced by the explosive, surpris- ing planet Uranus (shocking news, nuclear devices, the future) passage into the sign of Pisces (religion, Arabia, deception) and will slowly expose and transform the church from what it is today. Have the people of this country and other parts of the world finally realized that confining God to a multitude of churches, tem - ples, synagogues destructive doctrines and deities is wrong? But how long will it take to disentangle over 2000 years of Neptune’s deceiving powers and its reli - gious jurisdiction upon this world? Ignorance is evil and for all its purposes, positive and negative, religions ignore and avoid the teachings of the true manifestation of the creator through its own creation, the stars! And yes, astrology is against my religion I heard, what about those 3 Kings (astrologers?) following a bright Star? And how did the sailors promoting the good words of the Lord in the “Dark Ages” sail the ocean? By and with the help of the stars I presume. Too many people do not have enough com - mon sense and many of them are simply religiously poisoned with doctrines to the point of spiritual numbness since childhood. Their true spirit sank into fears and ignorance as planned by a politically oriented and the extremely wealthy and well-organized church of your choice. 10 Moonpower Stargate 2006"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Back in 1991 on the Art Bell radio show I had made that awful prediction and said the words, “religious war in the US.” But he and his audience did not hear me then. He didn’t even believe me with a copy of my book sent to him certified with his name and my predictions printed (Art Bell - OFF THE AIR!) and an up - coming US religious war. It all unfolded as predicted and printed in the book but no acknowledgement of the facts came from this very scared and devout man! Many people have had to endure drastic psychological and physical changes losing a loved one or a posi - tion. I must admit that the Dragon passage through any sign and house, or its location at birth, will always bring an incredible positive or negative energy to that area and will induce the badly needed changes.

The firmament of the new millennium is already upon us and with this New Year, various opportunities and new tasks are ahead of us. Whatever you had to go through last year, learn to promote only positive thoughts. There is no room for the sorrows of the past in your future, and whatever you had to go Letter From the Author 11"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"through, the job of building a new life must be done. For every action, positive or negative, physical or spiritual, there will be an equal reaction. So, be aware of your thoughts, as your future starts right there. The reincarnation of your own very thoughts will sooner or later become your reality. No matter what you’ve been through, you must let go of the past, refine your thoughts, purify your spirit and keep working towards your goals. Whether you realize it or not, progress was made towards some of your objec - tives. If, after all the hard work you completed, things got messed up, the uni - verse may be trying to tell you something. Either you did not try hard enough, or the people you are working with do not have the same ethical aims as you. Possibly some of your wishes cannot be granted because of your limited working environment, lack of respect for the Universal Law, a limitation from your Astro-Carto Graphy location, or an inappropriate emotional relationship. Therefore, you were first fired or dismissed, allowing the universe to grant you the freedom and opportunity you needed to go in the right direction. Now, knowing it was a blessing that you’ve lost your job, someone you loved, etc., you must accept the challenge to start all over again with a positive attitude. It might sound strange at first to accept my theory, but subconsciously you actu- ally did set the stage over the years. Look back with an objective mind; after all, those experiences were needed so that you ultimately could do the right thing for yourself. You may also need to educate or trust yourself a bit more, or take more chances. Keep in mind the principle “for every action there will be a reaction,” and that’s called (good or bad) Karma. Are you willing to initiate the changes? If you do, the upcoming year will be a formidable year of accomplishment for you. Offensive people may have mistreated you emotionally or financially and left you in a distressed situation. No matter what you experienced, you must go on with your life. This world is a teaching ground, and sometimes we learn lessons that may be harsh to deal with where we must feel the result of all our negative words and actions through pain and suffering. Exacting experiences seem to be the only way for humankind to burn karma and gain real knowledge. It is an inferno of passions and stress, well designed by God, to refine us from ignorance and destruction to the purest form of love and knowledge. Before reincarnating yourself in this dense physical world, you have chosen a specific time in space. You also picked a set of stars (your natal chart), the coun - try and city of your birth, as well as the souls who ultimately became your par - ents. You may not be aware of it just yet, but your karmic plan on this “hell” plane was chosen by you. Your soul’s aim is to free itself from this low dimension and reach perfection to further its eternal purpose. What you are actually doing is furthering your cosmic consciousness, rising above all earthy vices and be - coming a CO-creator with God. 12 Moonpower Stargate 2006"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Over the years, the experiences you suffered will consume some of that karmic debt and further the awareness of your purpose of immortality. Some precious people whom you loved have left you and moved on while others have been called to the great beyond and are now performing in another reality much closer to God. They will act as Guardian Angels and will always watch over you. By interacting with the Dynamics of our universe and conforming to the dia - logue of God’s will through the stars, man’s karmic journey could be easier. My book, Moon Power Starguide was created for the purpose of assisting you to live your life in harmony with the cosmic will. This book will provide you with a day-to-day celestial guidance and genuine spiritual support. Its content is healing, informative, entertaining and useful. In times of trouble, this work will touch you directly and give you solid direction and a means of di - vine support. The daily message of the stars will prepare you for your day and beyond. With patience and investigation, you will notice how much the planets affect you, others and your life in general. In this work, you will find cautionary and specific guidance for certain days. Just be aware of the dates and, most of all, listen and watch those around you. Like robots, your friends, parents, chil- dren, loved ones will respond to the tremendous pull of the stars. To the learned man, the daily celestial energy released upon the earth is obvious, and it shapes our thoughts and actions, vices and virtues. Teaching anyone to recog- nize and respect God’s subtle tools is a large task. However, with education, time and observations, those who “ask, shall receive” cosmic knowledge. The stars do not pick favorites, not you, me or anyone else, but, much as with everything in nature, and they simply do their jobs. As imposed by the Creator in its sublime celestial design, their task is to affect us to make us discover. Learning to interpret the universal mind will be beneficial to us all. Curiosity will bring the golden key to wisdom and further more cosmic consciousness upon the world. This fact changes lives, mostly because knowledge means power. The possibility of achieving the best, in promoting education, peace of mind, faith, love - a chance to experience genuine happiness. Over the years, Starguide’s essence will help you to control the outcome of your destiny. Do not hesitate to offer Starguide to a loved one or a friend in need. You are not just giving a book; you become a contributor of hope and enlighten - ment. You are empowering someone with a genuine piece of the Divine.

The Greek mythology teaches that the moon was the focus point between Earth and Heaven. The ancients believed that spirits going to and from Heaven would stop upon the moon. Before entering the afterlife, the spir- its would have their souls purified. On the way back to Mother Earth, through reincarnation, the spirits would go right to the face of the moon to receive their new physical bodies. The Hindu texts “Upanishads” also states the advanced souls went to the moon after passing away to await reincarnation. Also stated is that the progressive souls who are untied from chain of reincarnation, will go straight to the sun. Many cultures associated the gods and goddesses with the moon and are represented with horns (Moses was a Lunar cult Leader fighting a Sun Stellar group, religious wars started in antiquity.) Changes and growth is associated with the moon, due to its waxing and waning every 28 days...the moon expire and then is reborn for a new cycle. The Greek philosopher Plutarch alleged that we have two ends. The first would take place on this world when our physical body expires. The physi - cal body will then turned into dust, while the soul and the mind will jour - ney into the spiritual world. There, the second death takes place, separating the mind and soul. The spirit would then return to the Moon, retaining all of that person life’s memories. The mind would then journey to the Sun where it was absorbed into the light and then reborn. Lastly, the mind would return to the Moon, rejoin with the soul and then journey back to Earth for the eternal reincarnation process."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"“There is a tide in the affairs of men which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune; omitted, all the voyage of their life is bound in shal - lows and in miseries.” — Julius Caesar, Act IV, Scene iii Every day that God has created, sees the procession of stars across the vault of the sky. They have followed the same regular path through the heavens, tracing the immutability of the cosmos and its constellations, which have spoken to the wise since the beginning of time. This work will explain in detail the subtle en- ergy produced by the Moon’s passage through the twelve houses and signs of the Zodiac. These houses govern the twelve facets of our life, and the rhythms of our life’s cycle, our emotions, finances, consciousness, home, children, ca- reer, friends, wishes, fears, love, personality and all that goes to make our sor- rows and joys. Depending on the mystical rhythm of the Moon and her relationship—-harmonious or discordant—-to the constellation and houses of the sky over which they rule, she will govern our human activity and give birth to our vices and virtues. The infinite and concealed dance of the Moon through the Zodiac is far from affecting only you, but all of us. You are a “microcosm” or a child of the Universe and there is reason for you to be. You are a part of this incredible physical and spiritual structure called a “macrocosm.” Sir Isaac Newton wrote “for every action there is an equal and opposite reac - tion”. We are what we think, having become what we thought. This statement emphasizes that for every thought or action there will be an effect. This is what I call the “Universal Law,” the causes and effects of the yin and yang recognized as the law of karma. The Moon is by herself quite responsible for some of the world and people’s fate. By tracking the Universal Law and using the Moon Power’s information, you will be allowed to see this lunar impact and reaction every day of your life. Obviously, the waxing and waning periods of our closest satellite will produce the daily process of tides. Thus, women will have spiritual 18 Moonpower Stargate 2006"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"and physical manifestations (menstruation), and all of us will be responding sub - consciously to the word “lunatic.” Without a form of opposition such as the Moon’s fluctuations, there would be no reaction and thus no life possible on both the spiritual and physical planes. “Our so-called “dead” satellite is very much alive; she is the beating heart of the earth. Vigilantly observing her whereabouts will aid un - derstanding of the psychology of man.” — Dr. Turi The Changing face of the Moon was revered and understood by the ancients as an aspect of the feminine and idolized as the Lady of the Night who ruled over fertility and magic. Your awareness of the Moon’s passage through the Zodiac will enable you to discover a basic structure of energy patterns that underlies the changes and circumstances of your life. This is, indeed, the purpose of a good astrologer, and his main objective is to reveal an order or meaning beneath or within what often appears to be a random or chaotic situation. The Moon’s pas- sage through the housing system is one expression of the archetypal structure we call a cycle. While many of the formally educated scientists have lost their cosmic conscious- ness, it has remained hidden within astrological values and basic astrological foundations. All of the signs of the Zodiac, the twelve houses, and the numer- ous astrological aspects are based upon God’s higher order in the established, interstellar cycle. Their subtle meanings are derived from a particular place or negative affliction or function to each other’s, and all operate within the ordered cycle as a whole. Our lives unfold according to our specific cyclic pattern, inter - acting with the Universal cycle. Discerning the Universal Mind at work is diffi - cult; those gifted at birth will naturally understand the cosmic mind, using their inborn, intuitional and objective mental tools. However, when properly edu - cated, anyone can learn to further his cosmic consciousness and realize his close relationship with God and the Universe. It often starts with a willingness to ex - pand the consciousness and the simple realization: that which may be invisible to our senses nevertheless still exists. That’s what makes a real scientist, investi - gation! Sadly enough, the majority of these souls fear ridicule or abandonment by their peers or churches. The obvious structure of the Moon’s cycle is derived from the fact that it con - sists of a beginning, middle and an end. Thus, the monthly lunar cycle suggests by observation that it is divided into two halves. During the first half, the move - ment is outward, as our close satellite travels away from the area of space occu - pied by the Sun. As this happens, the powerful light of the Sun increases, “waxing” (positive) on the white face of the Moon. The Full Moon symbolizes Moon Power – The Universal Law 19"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"the turning point in it reverses motion. The Moon begins to approach the Sun as the reflected light on its surface “wanes” (negative), until they meet again at the New Moon (new start). Halfway between the New Moon and the Full Moon, we notice another important division point where light and darkness are equal on the moon’s surface. At the first waxing quarter, the light is increasing, while at the last waning quarter, it is decreasing. These simple astronomical observa - tions can only provide the scientist’s mind with knowledge for interpreting the physical lunar cycle’s phase. Now if the positive cannot be with the negative, and knowing that it takes “Two to Tango” for anything to be, then the scientist should be able to “investigate” the intuitional domain of this work. There was hidden truth beyond to this “lunar manifestation,” and I then began to nurture my own critical observations. Later in life I realized that there was so much more beyond traditional star study (Astronomy). As a child, I always thought of the moon to be something more than a dead sat - ellite orbiting the earth. Many times in the darkness of the night, I found myself staring at her, wondering about her hidden power. She is the swiftest of the planets, passing through the 12 signs of the zodiac in about 28 days. I knew that eventually, I was to uncover her subtle ways and find the answers. To me, all those stars in the sky, shining above my head, were more than bright dead rocks in the darkest night. It does however; take more than our five senses to tap into her subtle manifestation upon our psyches and life in general. Nothing happens randomly in the universe, and the timely return in full each month surely indi- cates an ultimate order. Month after month, I patiently watched her becoming New and Full, and I learned my first, and one of the most important lesson in metaphysics, “The undiluted truth is not to be found inside man’s limited world, but in other worlds and the Universal mind.” Being so close to the earth, the Moon’s magnetic pull is so great, that she is solely responsible for the daily process of the tides. Curiosity, observation and comparison become the essential elements to promote anyone’s cosmic con - sciousness. As I met her, becoming full and new, month after month, I slowly began to understand her powers. By constantly watching my environment, friends and family members, she began to speak about her clearly visible impact and control over man’s psyche. As the years went by, I realized her uncompro - mising pull over the sea, and I became more aware of her powerful impact on our daily affairs. I made notes day after day, week after week and month after month, realizing the heavy consequences of either ignoring or adapting to her passage through the twelve signs of the Zodiac. I learned that the farmers of the past followed her fluctuations for the betterment of their crops. Then I carefully put my observations to test in my life and the lives of those around me. I did not take long to realize that by respecting the Universal Law, my life became much more productive. Her positive and negative affect on man’s emotions, actions 20 Moonpower Stargate 2006"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"and reactions became so obvious to me that I decided to make it my full time job to tell others about her. As I watched the news in times of a full Moon, I under - stood why people became destructive, “lunatic,” eccentric, moody and psycho - pathic. I then named it the Uncompromising Universal Law. Since then, as a professional Divine Astrologer, wherever I am needed, I am teaching the value of this simple and valuable knowledge. When you first learned how to drive a car, you were carefully introduced to the rules of the road. You learned that you must stop at a red light or follow a road sign, as your very life depends on your doing so. These are the codes that you have learned, and they must be respected anywhere you happen to be in the world. Following established rules will take you safely wherever you have to go. Sadly enough, too many people do not respect these rules, and innocent people have died accidentally. Awareness, knowledge and respect of these rules are desperately needed. However, the spiritual rules established by God, written in the constellations, have been misplaced. Only a minority is aware of the impact produced by the moon, and the rest, the majority of us are completely ignorant of God’s Divine rules. The result is seen during a Full Moon and each time the moon is crossing a destructive sign. This lack of awareness turns into formida- ble chaos, which produces despair, psychopaths, drug addicts, depression, vio- lence, criminals ... and the list goes on. Know that by ignoring either the physical or spiritual rules leads to a very heavy penalty. So-called “holy wars” have plagued man all through the ages. Ignorance and fear cast aside God’s true Universal message. To my mind, the millions of deaths produced by continuous religious wars all around the world were a good exam- ple of the destructive power of fanaticism. I realized that everyone’s relation- ship to God or many gods was deeply personal and that no two people feel the same way about it. My great mother taught me that God is love, beauty, educa - tion, responsibility and knowledge, beliefs I have steadfastly clung to. I have no - ticed the dualistic nature of life, man/woman, front/back, up/down, black/white, yin/yang, positive/negative, the ultimate law of opposition. I soon began to real - ize that nothing would exist without its counterpart, and this Law of opposition was much too obvious to be challenged or ignored. I began to wonder if God would exist without the Devil. One month is made up of two 2-week cycles, one year of two 6-month periods. From the New Moon (black dot on your calendar) to the Full moon (a circle on your calendar), the light is green Those two weeks are called “the waxing time.” Then when you see her full, white and round, the light is red. Those two weeks are called “the waning time.” As she starts her positive waxing time, you should plant your seeds for life. Go out, meet new people, socialize, get engaged, get married, buy a new car, go shopping, sign important contracts, travel, visit family members and generally promote all you can during this positive trend. My Starguide has all the New Moon Power – The Universal Law 21"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"and full moons available for entire year. Also, Starguide tells you when and in which sign the New Moon or the Full Moon will mature. You can use this knowl - edge to master the outcomes of all your endeavors. Initiate ideas or projects as she climbs happily through the heavens. When she finally becomes full, beware of the approaching “yellow light,” as this signals a time to slow down and reflect. During the day you must work hard and perform your tasks, while nature re - quires you to rest and sleep during the night. The same rules apply with the Moon. As she is ascending (waxes) you must dwell with the future, the dense physical world and, as the ancients did, put your seeds in the ground. Again, af - ter the full Moon (and for two weeks) as the Moon descends (wanes), you will deal better with metaphysical endeavors, feel like cleaning up, and possibly suf - fer psychically, as the moon is the regulator of your inner emotions. Use your will to fight depression, clean your house, prepare your next move, and write letters but don’t send them just yet. Observe and listen to all the peo - ple around you. Many will suffer the waning Moon’s power and will become negative, moody and lunatic. Watch the news and see for yourself the dramatic differences in the two periods. However, good things can happen then. This means, officially, that somehow you started “that” situation during her waxing, positive time, and you are now being paid-off. Bad things can also happen to you when the Moon is supposedly positive. It might only be a tap on your hand, compared to what could have happened. Keep in mind you have been going through your life not knowing nor using the Universal Law. You did not interact with the Moon’s fluctuations (the gearbox of our solar system), and many gears (your experiences) have broken down. Apply your knowledge immediately, and take the time to invest in your understanding of Astrology (the dynamics of our Universe). I often use this sample in reference to the respects of the physical and spiritual laws. If you were to travel in China and you could not read, under - stand or follow the road signs, chances are that you would get hurt. Those laws, even if you are not aware of them, are solid and practical. There is no room for ignorance in this dense physical world, and a heavy penalty awaits those ignorant and skeptical souls. The Moon also commands women’s menstrual periods, and both the Moon and women share the same twenty-eight-day time period. Work non-stop around the Moon’s passage, every sign of the Zodiac, and then her deepest secret will by yours. As she travels through the belt of the Zodiac, she will be residing be - tween two to three days in one sign; she will melt your emotions with the ener - gies (positive or negative) found in that specific astrological sign. Never forget that an ultimate higher order has been established, and the essence of our emo - tional life is within.

For good or for worse, the people and leaders of this Era were born with this affliction. Hitler was born on April 20, 1889 and Pluto (power) was located in the sign of Gemini (communication) from 1883 until 1913. Wherever the planet Pluto is located by sign and house in your chart, a sense of power and regeneration will be offered to you. Thus, using his well-known, in - born “hypnotic sound power,” it was easy for Hitler, in his numerous “Plutonic” speeches, to persuade the wise German population to go to war against the rest of the world. Pluto in Cancer: “The Wasted Baby Generation” the immediate generations to suffer Hitler’s manipulation were the young German soldiers and everybody else around the world born between 1913 and 1937 with Pluto (death) in Cancer (family). Thus, the “invaders” and all of the war’s victims were the result of an awful Pluto disturbing the basic security principle, homes, families and indeed can be associated with the First and Second World Wars, into the sad historically “Wasted Baby Generation.” The entire world and its security (Cancer) were shattered between both deadly (Pluto) World Wars, and millions of children from many different ethnic groups met with their fate. Pluto in Leo: “The Baby Boom Generation” When Pluto moved from Cancer (security/home) to Leo (love/life) from 1938 to 1957, the world experienced a re-birth of its population. Responding subconsciously to the power of the stars, the unaware masses called the phenomenon “The Baby Boom Generation.” Leo (Sun) rules love, the arts, freedom, and the 50’s and 60’s were good examples of the love and freedom-oriented attitudes with hippie music and drugs (Wood stock) that plagued this generation. Pluto rules sex, and Leo children became a free, sexually oriented generation. Jimmy Hendrix’s fate (sex, drugs, rock-and-roll), is a good example of a personal Pluto in Leo that ultimately got the best of him. Pluto in Virgo: “The Baby Buster Generation” Pluto then moved to the puritani - cal sign of Virgo (health) from 1957 to 1976, and this generation is next to take governmental power. This generation is fanatic about nature, perfection, work and health. Smokers have already suffered the impact of this “Baby Buster Gen - eration,” as this generation must upgrade health and perfection in our society."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Unlike Leo (life) Virgo is dry and sterile, thus fewer babies were produced during this era. Since Pluto entered the sign of Virgo, facilities for health programs and exercising boomed to satisfy a generation that craves fitness. The health busi - nesses (body/ mind/tools) have started and are still booming with Pluto in Virgo. This generation is banning smokers from restaurants and public places (and they voted the 40-cent tobacco tax increase), and more rigid health oriented regula - tions are ahead of us. Note-This section and its predictions were written and published in the 1995 Moon Power edition. On a more positive note, this age group will fight hard to preserve nature, animals and the remainder of the rain forest. Many powerful computers and microchips developed by this generation as experienced in Operation Desert Storm, are deadly accurate. Their ideal is very pure in thought and action, but this generation must guard against Pluto’s (fanaticism) subtle power for “perfection.” If the power of Pluto in Virgo is exag - gerated, it becomes as deadly as the poison they try so hard to avoid. Many of these souls will lose their lives by being too concerned with health (an - orexia, hypochondria), turning rapidly to vegetarian diets, thus upsetting their naturally weak digestive tracts. They must understand that cats and dogs were born with strong claws and long, sharp teeth to tear apart raw flesh as intended by nature, while cows, horses, lambs, etc. are herbivores and were designed by God with flat teeth and three stomachs to eat only “salad.” They are none of those. They are omnivorous and must eat meat as a vigilant balance for their sensitive metabolism. Some souls who are overwhelmed by Pluto are overly crazy for carbohydrates. They are also protein paranoid. Some starve them- selves after 6:00 p.m. Others take their heart rates much too seriously, some have a penchant for pain, and more are victims of the fat-burning syndrome. Worst of all for women is the weight lifting dilemma. It is, genetically speaking, impossible for a woman to take on a man’s physical power, and no matter how hard they try; they will never look like Arnold Schwarzenegger. Because of the inborn critical attitude and a strong desire for health and perfection, those natu - ral “puritans” will not find someone good enough for them and many will end up alone in the game of love.

Please take the time to visit my site and read “SOS To The World” Pluto in Libra: “The Gang Generation.” From October 5, 1971 until November 6, 1983, dramatic Pluto (death) moved into the sign of Libra (partnerships). Traditionally Libra rules the 7th house, associations, open enemies, partners and the day-to-day people entering your life. This nefarious combination cre - ated a form of regular open-death manifestations as shown by the infamous, daily drive-by shootings. Born with Pluto (death) in Libra (others), those children are willing to die for their inner Plutonic sense of justice (scales) imposed by their partners (gang members). Constantly influenced (bullied) by Pluto or more ferocious souls, they must give in to their high sense of justice for the group. This righteous “die for you/die for me” attitude is now in full operation in our present society and has created “The unbalanced Aggressive Gang Genera- tion.” If not for survival or money, then respect, power and justice belong to the group (no matter what), and Pluto is the subtle force behind gang activity. The Plutonic rough initiation principle (beating) is a form of love/hate/submission, a participation and respect found within the sign of Libra in the declaration of peace or war. Then, the ruthless test for security, love, hate, respect and deadly commitment to others (Libra) in the group (gang) has been established. Con- trary to what is commonly believed, and to the amazement of psychologists, many children of the gang generation have had perfect upbringings and many are from middle and upper class families. Early environment plays an important part in how these souls will react to others. If the upbringing happens to be rough and difficult, these Plutonic souls may be - come the imposing bullies. Negative members of this generation are in constant need of a dramatic regeneration principle-taking place within a group constantly involved in war with others. To those born with Pluto in Libra, it is also a sure in - dication of a strong inner sense of justice owed to the group for good or for bad. This Pluto (death) generation in Libra (the law) will savagely fight their enemy (authority figures) and other gangs without any fear or regard for the deadly con - sequences. This problem with the police force has already started and will keep dangerously growing, making some parts of the cities unsafe for the common citizen. This sad situation will continue swelling to a dangerous size and will force the government to take drastic measures. The year 1998 will be a memo - rable year, as strong efforts will be made to avoid the breaking down of our soci - ety. In the process, many youths and numerous police officers’ lives will be wasted.

Those very young and wild children have already made dramatic news by executing each other and murder - ing adults for any reason. Such as in Rachula, Missouri on December 28, 1994, an off-duty police officer had been shot to death by his girlfriend’s 9-year-old grandson. The child was born with Pluto in Scorpio on his Dragon’s Tail (nega - tive). Many of those “kids” have been reported killing adults for money to buy drugs and guns at the tender age of 10 years. Again in May 1997 a brutal slay - ing follows a beer drinking in Central Park, New York. Two teenagers stabbed a real estate agent at least 30 times and tried to chop off his hands so police couldn’t use fingerprints to identify him before dumping him in a lake in Central Park. Perpetrators, Daphne Abdela, 15, and her boyfriend, 15-year-old Chris - topher Vasquez, “gutted the body so it would sink.” Both of those young souls are from the dramatic Pluto generation, “The Death Wish Generation.” More than previous degrading generations, these children need constant spiritual re - generation and a good reason to be alive. Note - So far this drugged US generation produced over 800 murderers age 15 or younger in 1995, many of them raised in environments that included abuse, neglect and violence. However, youth violence is neither new nor confined to the United States. Well, governor. Mike Huckabee you can offer all the sympathy of the world for the victims of the school shooting, and like millions of others lament on a culture that would breed such a tragedy. That is NOT the answer, as you already know that it will happen over again. You, including the educational, psychological, police and governmental system are loosing the battle and will soon watch the breaking down of our young society. Scientists from all levels out there are mes - merized and baffled by the awful events that took place on March 25 th , 1998 in JONESBORO, Arkansas. Unless you cast aside your fear of the ridicule fueling your academically oriented ignorance and your mental snobiness, you will not be able to even get closer to the golden key of true knowledge. You might have to challenge your precious books, pass the limitation of your rational mind and realize that the higher truths were never been printed by your kind. It’s time to look above your head; into the Universal Mind, with a different attitude. If you have any hope what so ever, to provide serious help to this “Death Wish Gener - ation.” Thus, our society is already witnessing “The Dramatic Death Wish Generation” in action. They are strong-willed, unwavering in thought and action, immensely emotional and totally fearless in front of death. Pluto (sex) is making them very active sexually at an early age, and they will look for a mixture of sex, crime and drugs to survive their harsh young lives. At the tender age of 12 years many of those children have already experienced the use of drugs and sex and some oth - 28 Moonpower Stargate 2006"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"ers have committed repellent murders.

They will not react to dogma and common religious teachings as they parents do. Those kids subcon - sciously understand the principle of life and death and the motivation behind all manifestation. They simply lack the regenerative forces produced by the mysti - cal knowledge to deal with their passionate and rebellious nature.

Let’s just hope that the worst elements of this “Death Wish” generation get spir- itual guidance quickly, or imperatively auto-destroy themselves, for the sake of all of us. If God’s implacable Universal Rules have been broken and ignored for too long, a serious penalty is awaiting mankind. There is no room for ignorance at any level of consciousness or any other worlds above or below us. Slowly but surely, mankind is witnessing the slow and painful suffocating end of another young generation. Hopefully, our scientists will cast the “ridicule” aside and a solid investigation of “Divine Astrology” will bring it back into the tradi- tional educational system.

Note: Regardless of Dr. Turi’s expectations posted on his website for the second time and his desperate attempts over the years to make NASA officials aware of dangerous Super Nova Windows, the Columbia was also launched during this window and re-entered the last night of it producing the death of all courageous astronauts.

Be well, my friend. “All I have asked for is a fair scientific investigation of my work for the sole purpose of promoting mans cosmic consciousness, saving time, money and the lives of many people.” — Dr. Turi Predictions For The Century Approximately every two thousand years, our planet comes under the influence of a new zodiacal sign. January twelve, 1996 marks the entrance of Uranus (the future) into his own sign of Aquarius (new age). We slowly begin to explore the possibility of a new consciousness and uncover both the strength and danger of this incredible upcoming age. This liberal sign follows nebulous Pisces. Over the last twenty years, Uranus (the awakener) has advocated more discoveries than have been made during the last 2000 years spent under the illusive power of Neptune (ruler of Pisces). Pisces is the last sign of the Zodiac, and traditionally, it rules the twelfth house. This area governs restriction, sorrow, imprisonment, psychological trouble and secret enemies as well as creativity, dance, high forms of music and works of art. Enclosed and confined places such as asylums, hospi- tals, churches, prisons, movie theaters, concert halls and theme parks are Nep- tune’s legacy. It is also a mute energy; it has no voice of its own. Submissive by nature, Neptune tends to make those born under its heavy influence pessimists and fatalists prone to addictions and fanaticism. It is a deceiving energy prone to suffering and acceptance. Nuns, evangelists, drug addicts are particularly loaded, for good or for bad, with Neptune’s illusive power. Interestingly, the two thousand years that has elapsed during the rule of Pisces started around the time of the beginning of Christianity. For nearly 2000 years, the world has been largely under the influence of Judeo-Christian theol - ogy, whose first early chosen symbol was the sign of the fish. Oriental and near-Oriental minds delight in fairy stories, and they are continually spinning such beautiful myths about the lives of religious and political heroes. In the ab - sence of printing, when most human knowledge was passed by word of mouth, from one generation to the next, the illusive power of Pisces opened the doors for myths to become tradition and those traditions to eventually be accepted as fact. Unmistakably, under the sign of Pisces, Jesus Christ suffered sorrow, imprison - ment, restrictions and tortures at the hands of secret political enemies. Also, Christianity has been preaching the blind acceptance of suffering, repentance and sacrifice, if you are to proceed to the paradise of God. According to astrol - 34 Moonpower Stargate 2006"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"ogy, Neptune’s energy (Pisces) forces the soul towards its opposite sign (Virgo) or the Virgin Mary and its purity principle. This indicates why Christians have subconsciously chosen the symbol of the fish to represent their religion and be - liefs. The last 2000 years of Neptunian influence have produced over 875 dif - ferent religions worldwide, and in the process, millions of people have died and still die in devastating holy wars. It is well documented that many former civilizations simply worshipped God or gods with the stars, the moon and the sun. The Creator’s Divine Manifestation throughout the Universe (Astrology) was well used and understood by the an - cients. Whereas Pisces is mute and accepting, Aquarius has a voice. Aquarius rules curiosity, invention, electronics, the UFO phenomena and astrological in - vestigation. Uranus rules the future, electronics, electricity, radio, television, airships and aeronautics. Among its metals are uranium, radium and all the other radioactive elements. Thus, we can look upon the Aquarian age as a bringer of hope, universal love, and as a promoter of great technological advances and vast increases in man’s mental exploration. Uranus rules cosmic consciousness, psychic awareness and the genius quality of man. Uranus is also classified as the “sudden release of en- ergy” and is responsible for nature’s devastating forces such as earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes and typhoons. Wrongly used, Uranus can be the potential destroyer of the human race through the use of atomic weaponry and as yet un- discovered powers. We must learn to understand the true message of Aquarius and the awesome power of Uranus. We must overcome the negative forces of this planet, for that is the lesson of the age of Aquarius, to enjoy an age of great spiritual awakening. We must learn to accept the values and workings of Uranus upon our thought processes, thus creating our own amazing future reality complete with ETs and UFOs. We must create a universal brotherhood, where love, progress and re - sponsibility become the ultimate goals. If we fail to recognize the awesome power of Uranus, the Aquarius age may be the last age man will live on this planet. We have twelve months, 12 hours, 12 apostles. The twelve apostles are a hid - den representation of the 12 gods of the zodiac. Symbols have survived to this day from very ancient times. In the Catholic church today, the staff the bishops carry is a carry-over of the staff held by the Egyptian God Osiris. The symbol of the Christian cross was taken from the Egyptian ankh which represented life and fertility. The high pointed hat worn by the Pope, was derived from Osiris’ tall crown. And even the traditional birthday of Jesus, celebrated on the 25 th of De - cember, is taken from the birthday of the Egyptian God, Horus."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"36 Moonpower Stargate 2006"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"2006 Slow-Moving Planets Predictions The great planet Jupiter entered the sign of Scorpio on October 26 th , 2005 and will enter Sagittarius on December 24 th 2006.

This formula does not reflect the modern astrology disciplines you may use, study or practice. Realize that over 500 years ago the famous Prophet did not use a watch or any sophisticated computers. Thus like the great Seer, I investigate outer space and the Universal mind with my inborn spiritual telescope. A “mi - croscopic attitude” will not help anyone gain the Golden key to spiritual knowl - edge. This limited exploitive attitude is for “astronomers” who have long lost their cosmic consciousness with their rigid mathematics and scientifically ori- ented minds. We have all heard of missing the forest looking at a tree. Every one of them is aware of the twelve constellations of the Zodiac; somehow it is still impossible for them to pass the limitation of their five rational senses. To penetrate the intuitive domain of those stars is the only way for them to enter the archetypal realm of consciousness and decode the subtle meaning behind each symbol. Realize that Divine Astrology is an extremely old celestial art and a very complex science and must be practiced as such. Not everyone is blessed with the “gift” needed to assimilate, understand and translate correctly the heavenly dexterity of the Creator. That’s why a section of the bible clearly mentions, “I will talk to you; but you won’t hear me! I will present myself to you; but you won’t see me!” God speaks to us within his own manifestation and through his Divine light. Only those willing to expand their cosmic consciousness will be able to “perceive and receive” the real manifestation of God. For those born on the cusp of any zodiacal sign, simply refer to the month of your birth, which re - flects the exact constellation of your nativity. Divine Astrology, as practiced by Nostradamus, is the creation of Dr. Turi and a more accurate and simplistic way of looking at the stars. All students have found it to be incredibly accurate.

Because of your strong desire to communicate, you are classified in Greek mythology as “The Messengers of the Gods.” You inherited a gift of youth, a double personality and a quicksilver mind enabling you to adapt easily to any situation. On a negative note, Mercury, the “Lord of the Thieves” breeds volatile and unreliable people due to their dual characteristics. You are a gifted communicator and radio, language, photography, sales, movies and any type of public relations work appeals to you. Your natural speed for life’s experiences makes you impatient and nervous. You must learn to focus and crystallize your powerful mind. You have the potential to become an efficient speaker and pro- duce interesting books. Due to your strong desire for security, many of you will be attracted to the real estate and food industries. Your financial potential is un - limited if you learn and make a good use of the Universal Law in charge of your Second House of income.

What they do not know is that the soul is simply programmed to naturally reject traditional educa - tion (because of a surplus amount of nervous energy produced by a strong Mer - cury they can not stay still for long or listen) thus opening the rare door to genius and with it the potential for new discovery.

Characteristics For Those Born In October The month of October is ruled by the planet Venus and by the charming sign of Libra. You are strongly motivated by a desire for justice and you must create harmony in all areas of life. You are classified as the “Peacemaker” in Astro- psychology. You will succeed in your career because of your gentle personality, your sense of diplomacy and your natural “savoir faire.” You rarely learn by mis- take, but you must avoid prolonged indecision. Those born in October must es- tablish Libra’s soul’s purpose of achieving balance, emotional, financial, and spiritual stability during the course of their lifetimes. You must stand for yourself and learn decision making by following not only your rational mind but also your accurate intuitions. You possess a strong psychological aptitude and do well in the real estate and the food industries, the stock market, interior design, mar - riage counseling and the arts in general. You must focus on what you need first by using inner stamina and both your practical and intuitive minds. These gentle personalities will be attracted to competitive people and one can expect many challenges from them. Rough behavior or the abrupt and assertive manner of a business partner easily offends Libras. The same desire for diplo - macy is expected from a friend or a lover. You should also avoid taking remarks too personally. You love a good home and you enjoy the company of busi - ness-oriented partners. Your downfall comes from traditional scientific or reli - gious teachings and your inability to challenge your way of life. Casting aside self-discovery and real spirituality will slow down or eliminate your chances to develop your cosmic consciousness. This produces mental snobs, librarians, ministers and religious leaders. As indicated by Libra’s scale, you must look at both sides of the dilemma.

Memo - On January 29th, 1998 Neptune entered the sign of Aquarius: This dreamy and deceiving planet will cruise through the genius-like sign of Aquarius until April 5, 2011. In the incredible sign of Aquarius (UFOs/microchips), Nep- tune’s creative energy will be used to the maximum. A wave of new electronic devices will be used within the cinematography industry (Titanic/Matrix and many other movies were produced since then!). The communion of Uranus (electronics) and Neptune (imagination) can only create incredible effects and super movies. Some will or did involve UFOs and/or Apocalyptic messages. Neptune (movie industry/make believe) in Aquarius (ingenuity) will promote a serious increase in creativity and a solid progressive restructure within the cine - matography industry. The Neptunian world of creativity and imagination fused with the futuristic sign of Aquarius has a lot to offer to cinemagoers. On a higher level, the spiritual essence of mankind’s religious belief systems is undergoing a rebirth, where the dogmatic religious views of the past will be replaced by more practical awareness of god divine celestial order and will bring forth more cos - mic consciousness to society at large. From that day on the true Universal face of God and his celestial manifestation will be revealed to mankind. 114 Moonpower Stargate 2006"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"Welcome to Your Day - to - Day Guidance For February 2006 February 1, 2006 — Venus enters Capricorn: The great planet of love and wealth is in the practical sign of Capricorn.

Once more realize that I do not use traditional dates found in popular ephem- era. Years of practical observation lead me to extend the Mercury retrograde motion and period of time. July / August: Second SUPERNOVA window - From Saturday July 1 st through Wednesday August 2 nd 2006. October / November: Third SUPERNOVA window - From Saturday October 21 st through Tuesday October 21 st 2006 . EXPLANATION OF A SUPERNOVA WINDOW There is a celestial concentration of negative celestial energy bombarding the earth for a few weeks. Be extremely prudent in driving, and expect chain-reac - tion accidents. Be prepared for delays, strikes, and nature producing awful weather, including hurricanes and tornadoes. The same energy that produced the Titanic disaster, the Northridge, Los Angeles, and Kobe, Japan, earthquakes is approaching again. Double-check all your appointments, and if you can, post - pone traveling and flying during this Supernova “window”. Communication and electricity will be cut off, and a general loss of power is to be expected. Appliances, computers, telephones, planes, trains, cars, all of these “tools” will be affected by this energy. They will be stopped in one way or another. The people of the past will make the news and will reenter your life. Ex - pect trouble with the post office, education, students, strikes, prisoners’ escape, newspapers, broadcasting industries and computer viruses may bother us again. 126 Moonpower Stargate 2006"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"Many a failed mission and expensive electronic equipment (Mars probe etc.) and our tax dollars have been wasted because of the scientist’s lack of knowledge of the stars. As usual NASA, which is not aware of the science of astrology, will waste our tax money with failed missions due to bad weather and electronic mal - functions. In the name of ignorance a few years ago, in the Challenger explosion seven astronauts lost their lives when NASA launched the shuttle under a “Su - pernova Window”. Note: Regardless of Dr. Turi’s expectations posted on his website for the second time and his desperate attempts over the years to make NASA officials aware of dangerous Super Nova Windows, the Columbia was also launched during this window and re-entered the last night of it producing the death of all courageous astronauts. Again in July 2005 NASA repeated the same error regardless of many failed at - tempts to launch the space vehicle. As expect foam from the fuel tanker damager the shuttle forcing astronauts to take an historic unplanned space walk costing millions of dollars for the tax payers once more and risking another disaster. When will NASA learn? Marine life sharks, whales etc may also beach themselves due to Mercury retro- grade affecting their natural inborn navigational systems. All these malevolent predictions and waste of lives and equipment do not have to occur. Those pre- dictions do not have to affect you directly as they unfold. Instead, they are printed to prepare you for setbacks and frustrations, thus advising you to be pa- tient and prudent during this trend. There is no room for ignorance, and those who are not aware of the celestial order, including the NASA space-program management team, will continue to pay a heavy price. In all mankind’s affairs, ig- norance is true evil. Why any scientists who are against my research do not honor the word science, which is based upon solid investigation, is solid proof of mental snobbery. By omitting any physical or spiritual laws can only bring pen - alty; for science’s purpose is to explore all possibilities, even those laws written in light via the stars.

Some lucky souls will be given the op - portunities to enjoy electrifying love experiences; they may end up with memorable moments to cherish for the rest of their lives. If your natal Venus is in a hard aspect to Uranus, your desire for freedom and experience will take over the real feeling and need for true love.

Souls born now will be given the opportunity to experience love on an intellectual level and will have to learn to show more emotion and compassion.

This position makes for one of the most original and magnetic partners. Usually artistic talent in writing, talking, photography, acting, and mental medicine is present with this position.

You are at the time of the month when you must wait for the green light; keep a low pro- file and all will be fine. Watch the dramatic news during this trend and realize the importance of having your Moon Power close by. As always, if Starguide works for you, it also works for others, so don’t be afraid to tell others to “cool” down. We are all under the incredible will of the cosmos, and Pluto will punish some unlucky souls for their ignorance of God’s universal rules. Partnerships : Be courteous with everyone as your true motives, feelings and de - sires are sure to be heard and felt. This is the time to use your will and apply your knowledge of the stars.

Work, Career and Business: As usual with Mars’ aggressive personality, expect all sorts of trouble with business partnerships. You are strongly advised to use diplomacy to avoid serious complications, especially during a waning Moon. If you are experiencing some trouble in your career, a serious change may be ahead of you. Neptune will make you absent-minded; try to concentrate. A lit - tle walk by the water would do your spirit good. Be patient, we are getting closer to the next New Moon.

Don’t let yourself into a deceiving business deal or worthless situation; learn to love with your head first and give your heart later. Your intuition will be sharp; use it to your advantage. A secret love affair may start for some earth signs and might last a while. Travel and Communication: Remember, Neptune is also part of this trend and if you have to drive, you MUST stay clear of any alcohol. Neptune leads many un - aware people to jail, left with DUIs to deal with. If you were born under a water sign stay clear of trouble if you feel depressed, don’t drink tonight. Environment : Venus will try to stop her violent brother from stirring the earth’s innards, as Mars loves earthquakes, explosions, volcanoes and mass disasters. Sad news may come from the ocean, the Middle East and oil spills. Mother earth is alive, resourceful, and must heal. Famous Personalities: Some prominent people may be caught in secret sexual or love affairs. Their dependency on chemicals, drugs or alcohol will be made pub- lic. The lucky ones will promote new movies. Under Neptune’s power — WEST HOLLYWOOD, California — Sheriff’s deputies pulled over Eddie Murphy early Friday and arrested a transsexual prostitute who was riding in his car, authorities said. A spokesman for the actor maintained Murphy was just being a “good Sa- maritan” by offering the transsexual a ride.

The storm comes a day after the worst sandstorm in 30 years blasted across the country. With Mars’ aggressive nature, expect this type of news again. Villains will be active during this trend; do not trust strangers and do not put yourself in any situation that could make you a potential victim. Avoid dark streets and keep your personal alarm (intuition) on all the time. Shopping : Try to participate in volunteer work to provide love and help to the needy.

Work, Career and Business: The Moon is still waning for a few days; forget about making any progress until then. This is a time where you should clean up the past and make new plans. Maybe you should try to relax while you can; you will feel better for the new challenges and you would enjoy the break. Keep your head out of the swarm of stress, let go for now and put a big smile on your face. People tend to react positively to a smiling face and a happy heart. Better times are on the way; the new Moon is not too far, just be patient. Partnerships : Someone close to you is upset.

Don’t let the waning moon sap your faith; stand strong, tomorrow is always better. Life is changing around you and you know it. Love Affairs: Just before the New Moon the energy is quite low. This trend may induce stress and may require both of you to control destructive emotions such as jealousy and suspicion. Love Affairs started now could be stressful and un - productive in the long run; use your head, use Starguide’s knowledge. This en - ergy will also force many unsuited couples to get out of their unhealthy relationships. The worst of both of these planets is to be expected mainly due to the fast dying Moon. Now is the time to use all the diplomacy you were born with to save your relationship before it’s too late. If you are a Libra, don’t be too critical about an older or younger person born in February or June who may be attracted to you. Travel and Communication: Many police officers will meet with trouble in speedy chases and dangerous confrontations, while trying hard to stop lunatics. Venus will help those who are willing to use her gentle touch of love in all they do. If you were born with a passionate Venus in a water sign, you will be chal- lenged by this celestial trend. A very high level of depressing energy will be im- posed upon many souls these days. Stay clear of chemicals, drugs and alcohol if you decide to take a trip. Environment : The police will be needed in some situation where nature will get out of hand. Let’s hope Venus will slow down Mercury’s windy nature and stop him from producing hard weather or tornadoes. Famous Personalities: Nothing good will come before the New Moon pertaining to the rich and famous. Scandals, sex, drugs and all the tools used by the “devil” will be made public. A very famous but unlucky person may also be assassinated or found dead. Events : Be aware, use Moon Power Starguide wisely and if you know someone involved in Law Enforcement, let them read this book. With Pluto (death) still cruising through the sign of Sagittarius, different religious agendas and destruc - tive passions will run high. A nasty confrontation with foreigners could be the outcome.

Others famous political figures or CEO’s have been brought down from their high positions of fame to disgrace, and thrown back to the bottom. Children born with this plac - ing will gain positions of power in all affairs involving the arts, teaching children and political fame. In times of stress they will experience problems with their heart and should avoid eating rich food or drink heavily when upset. With Sat - urn in Leo a general insecurity about raising children will plague the world. Par - ents should not overload their children with work and /or they own expectations for greatness and fame. With karmic Saturn in Leo the entire spectrum of Leo (*children/art/education) will be restructured. Thus expect tremendous changes wherever Leo or the sun resides in your chart. A 90-mn Full Life or progressive reading will be a must for many experiencing a strong urge to change career and deal with stress with love, romance and children. You are also strongly advised to order a 90 MN Children Character logy/Astropsychology tape to find the true potential of your child before forcing him or her into a career or study that may not fit the purpose and fate of that child.

Invest in your business now. Partnerships : Either the beginning or ending of an important part of your life, or a business partnership is a strong possibility within the next few days.

Be patient with someone responding to the Sun’s desire for power. It’s a good time to meditate by the ocean or the river about the high purpose of your joined fate, your relationship and how it fits in your life. The Sun will make these days particularly romantic and beautiful for some. Family and Friends: The Sun rules the children and love. Take the kids out to the park, but keep your eyes on them as, sadly enough, combined with other nega - tive stars, some have disappeared under this energy. Unspecified vampires out there regenerate only by dealing with children and they will do all it takes to sat - isfy their unhealthy hunger. Accept the upcoming transformation with faith, as the changes will promote a better life. You may want to plan a special gathering with someone you are close to. A friend will have to move away soon and this could bring tears. The family circle will also be active these days and mother will be requesting your presence. Enjoy Mom’s food at home in the security and safety of your own family if you are in a new area and do not know many people. Expect an element of surprise from friends. Love Affairs: Romance is on your mind more than ever and a meeting with some playmate can lead to an exciting love affair.

This position makes for one of the most mentally and physically domineering signs of the Zodiac. As with Venus in Leo, this Mercury position will lead the soul towards success in many artistic endeavors. An opportunity to experience mental fame is also offered to the soul. The downfall is the misuse of the creative forces of the Sun, producing egocentrics. Those young souls would do anything to attract attention to themselves, by behaving and dressing eccentrically in public, body piercing, hair coloring, over tattooing etc. This need for attention reflects a subconscious fear of inferiority and turns them into ridiculous dis - guised shining puppets of the stars.

Nothing comes easily; one must strive and plan if he is to succeed. With the Full Moon upon us, you might have to let go of someone or a portion of your business life soon. Let go. Family and Friends: You may receive or give presents to the deserving family member or dear friend. Take the time to enjoy the week and the good food of - fered to you and if you decide to socialize during the night, you should be aware of the waning Moon. A foreigner could make you happy and further an impor - tant wish. An older person has something to share with you, listen to the advice. Love Affairs: Someone you have known for a while, much older or much youn - ger, could surprise you — Don’t be shy with life; take a chance with someone you care for; there is plenty to gain in the long run if this person came into your life in a waxing Moon. This endeavor may lead to an opportunity to further your career. If you were born under any of the earth signs, avoid the Full Moon’s de- pressing power. If you are a Gemini, a Libra or an Aquarius will be getting closer to you. Listen to a friend born in April. Travel and Communication: Expect your telephone to be busy but the messages won’t be too good. Don’t try to be in so many places at the same time. If you have to drive, take extra time to get there; don’t rush, as the police could spoil your day. A brother or a sister needs to talk to you. Keep a positive attitude; positive people attract positive experiences. Remember a magnet won’t attract a piece of wood. Environment : In a Full Moon time, Mother Nature may decide to stretch herself and surprise some. Environmental groups will become active and will receive support from the media to save the earth from uncaring corporations. The earth will be active soon; stay clear of bridges as much as you can. Don’t take any chances for a while. Famous Personalities: The great loss of an old and eminent political, religious or entertainment figure will trouble the media soon. A group of people will work hard to help those starving in an area affected negatively by nature. Life goes on. Events : Under this energy 80 people were killed in a fire that gutted a shopping center in the West Java town of Bogor and in south-central Alaska a fire engulfed 7,000 acres and destroyed as many as 100 homes.

THU., FRI., SAT., SUN. — JUNE 15, 16, 17, 18: RULERS — Uranus (Explosions/Surprises) and Neptune (Oil/Middle East): Work, Career and Business: Combined with the Full Moon, Uranus may make you feel erratic and Neptune may make you feel depressed and overemotional at work; this could lead you to think about a new job. Keep your eyes and ears open; with Neptune’s “dreamy” nature, you are prone to making serious errors or forgetting something important. Do not sign any contracts now; in the long run, you will be sorry if you do. Be patient and wait until the next New Moon. Partnerships: Crazy things may happen now; do not make a fool of yourself in public. Things done or words said without forethought might bring trouble later. Use your will; be positive in all you say. Expect disturbing news by mail or telephone but avoid fears, as insecurity could take over your common sense; all will be fine, there is a Divine plan for you. This timing is ideal for meditation and renewing your faith in each other and the universe. You must control negative thoughts, even if many things around you do not seem positive. Have faith in yourself and those you care for during these days. Family and Friends: Spend some valuable time with your family. Do not expect the affairs of the heart to progress or get better for a while, and teenagers may get themselves in trouble. Watch for the use of drugs, as Neptune will lead them towards wrong friends. Give them solid direction and be ready for some fric- tion. Depressed friends may call you asking for spiritual support or direction. With Neptune, confusion and deception is in the air. If you socialize during the night hours, keep your eyes on your possessions as they may disappear. Don’t misplace your keys. Avoid complaining about life’s problems to those who care about you. Love Affairs: Love and romance may suffer as during a waning Moon, Uranus’ erratic emotions may preside and disturb your relationship. Be patient with the partner and use diplomacy to save trouble. However don’t let someone else’s problem get to you and affect your feelings. If you were born in August expect a Gemini friend to give you disturbing news soon. A friend from a foreign land may bring better but surprising news soon. All fire signs will suffer this lunation emotionally, so try not to let it happen to you, use you will. If you are a Leo, Sag - ittarius or Aries remember the waning Moon and be patient.

Nature will start to go berserk and may throw a cluster of negative weather patterns such as tornadoes or earthquakes in the near future. Remember the Florida tornadoes in 1998? Uranus was in charge then. Famous Personalities: Under Uranus power the British Artist John Michael made weird news in Los Angeles in a public bathroom, again surprising Uranus (weird) and Neptune (kinky sex) was in charge. Remember another British singer O’Connor? She cut up a picture Pope’s face on national TV in one of her per - formances, right in front of the entire audience. Again Uranus (freedom) and Neptune (religion) were in charge. Many unaware famous daredevils will lose their lives because they have no knowledge of the stars’ impact on human affairs. Do not take chances after the Full Moon, ever, and all will be fine. Events : Under Uranus’ powers expect anything weird and explosive to take place. Stay clear of strangers and any suspicious packages, especially in airports or dams. Let’s hope for the best! Many eruptions have taken place under this energy - 3/8/05 - CNN Mount St. Helens coughs up ash - 3/8/05 - Severe cy- clone hits Australia Shopping : Provide spiritual guidance and support to all in need.

A powerful hunch might save you trouble if you are unsure about a person or a business scheme. Don’t let Mars affect your judgment; be patient with everyone around.

Family and Friends: A difficult trend is taking place; do not let it get to you. Use your will and look for happy people. Starguide is preparing you for this type of celestial affliction; take a passive attitude and all will go your way. Use Venus’ loving touches with practical advice to provide spiritual help to those you care for, but realize your limits. You need your own spiritual strength to face those tough stars and you can do it. Love Affairs: Expect some secrets to be divulged, especially the ones related to sex or financial scandals. Venus’ gentle nature will reward you if you use her dip - lomatic, loving powers to smooth things out. Better stay home and enjoy good food during the late hours. A great movie with the one you care about this weekend is your best shot. Many will fall prey to con artists and weird sexual en- deavors. If you are a Virgo someone born in March, a Taurus or a Capricorn could be looking for you. A Cancer friend will give you good advice, but do not complain too much if you want to save your friendship. Stay clear of alcohol consumption. Travel and Communication: The people of your past will soon show up. After the Full Moon always stay clear of suspicious deals. Deal with the people you know and avoid dangerous dark alleys. Keep your eyes open and your personal alarm (intuition) on all the time. Mars rules man’s animal instincts and he could stimulate one of his aggressive children (Mars in bad aspect) to hurt you, given the occasion. With any trouble on the highway, stay inside your car with the doors secured. Many violent crimes have been reported during this type of en - ergy, especially when drugs or alcohol are involved; take no chances. Environment : Soft Venus will try to stop her violent brother Mars and Pluto from stirring the earth’s entrails and producing earthquakes, explosions, volcanoes and disasters. In time of a waning Moon and with a Supernova window in action she might not have much influence. Be ready for destruction from both Pluto and the red planet, Mars, “The Lord of War.” Famous Personalities: This same type of energy has taken the lives of many fa - mous people, sometimes dramatically. Drama, sex, and scandals of all sorts will go public and may induce suicidal tendencies in some prominent people. Stay clear of any chemicals and be aware around the water.

Work, Career and Business: The worse of both of these planets is to be expected mainly due to the waning Moon (negative) and the pessimistic trend of the Dragon’s Tail in Scorpio. Do not fall for depression or self-defeating attitudes. You may communicate your feelings but avoid uncontrolled imagination. The stars have a specific role to play in your life and you are the actor. Go with the trend, do not force issue, be patient and further your business life after the next New Moon. At work keep a low profile, your co-workers or your boss may not be aware of the work of the Moon on their psyches, and may become “lunatic” towards you. Keep busy and rearrange your desk or your paper work. Partnerships: If you want to save a difficult business relationship, now is the time to use full diplomacy and understanding. And with affairs of the heart, use Ve- nus’ loving touch; you could apologize with some flowers or a romantic dinner. Take serious precautions if you happen to be in the road as Mercury could mean impatience and speed. Family and Friends: Expect disturbing news involving friends, brothers or sisters and take the time to reply to the mail. If you get caught on the telephone, steer the discussion towards a positive tone. Mercury rules communication and will help you pass on your thoughts deeply and correctly.

Improve your cosmic consciousness and do some “deep” reading concerning life and death or metaphysics. Finish your book if you are into writing. Drive slowly and be ready for obstacles on the road. Be ready for the approaching Supernova window. Environment: Tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, and chain-reaction accidents due to bad weather are high on the list. Stay safe and be aware of Mother Na - ture’s destructive forces. She is alive and she needs to stretch herself now and then. Famous personalities: A famous individual from a foreign country will see the end of his life. Many will miss his message and his great spirit. Events: With the Tail of the Dragon in Libra at home in the US, acts of terrorism could produce devastating explosions. Stay clear of crowds, and listen to your intuition at all times. Avoid crowded places and beware of suspicious foreign- ers. Shopping: Electronic equipment, cars, telephones, computers, etc., may decide to give you trouble. The purpose behind this disturbing energy is to re-evaluate your existence and life’s mission and restructure your opportunities to make progress. Fix it or rent it but do not buy anything new now. Take care of your car as the machine may decide to let you down at the wrong time and in the wrong place. Be cautious and be patient. There will be three major negative SUPERNOVA windows in the year 2006. Each destructive “window\" is operational for three to four weeks, thus caution is strongly advised during this period. Heavy loss of lives due to nature’s devas - tating forces, aeronautical disasters and structural damage is to be expected. Once more realize that I do not use traditional dates found in popular ephem - era. Years of practical observation lead me to extend the Mercury retrograde motion and period of time. July / August: Second SUPERNOVA window - From Saturday July 1 st through Wednesday August 2 nd 2006. October / November: Third SUPERNOVA window - From Saturday October 21 st through Tuesday October 21 st 2006. EXPLANATION OF A SUPERNOVA WINDOW There is a celestial concentration of negative celestial energy bombarding the earth for a few weeks. Be extremely prudent in driving, and expect chain-reac - tion accidents. Be prepared for delays, strikes, and nature producing awful 190 Moonpower Stargate 2006"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"weather, including hurricanes and tornadoes. The same energy that produced the Titanic disaster, the Northridge, Los Angeles, and Kobe, Japan, earthquakes is approaching again. Double-check all your appointments, and if you can, post - pone traveling and flying during this Supernova “window”. Communication and electricity will be cut off, and a general loss of power is to be expected. Appliances, computers, telephones, planes, trains, cars, all of these “tools” will be affected by this energy. They will be stopped in one way or another. The people of the past will make the news and will reenter your life. Ex - pect trouble with the post office, education, students, strikes, prisoners’ escape, newspapers, broadcasting industries and computer viruses may bother us again. Many a failed mission and expensive electronic equipment (Mars probe etc.) and our tax dollars have been wasted because of the scientist’s lack of knowledge of the stars. As usual NASA, which is not aware of the science of astrology, will waste our tax money with failed missions due to bad weather and electronic mal - functions. In the name of ignorance a few years ago, in the Challenger explosion seven astronauts lost their lives when NASA launched the shuttle under a “Su- pernova Window”. Note: Regardless of Dr. Turi’s expectations posted on his website for the second time and his desperate attempts over the years to make NASA officials aware of dangerous Super Nova Windows, the Columbia was also launched during this window and re-entered the last night of it producing the death of all courageous astronauts. Again in July 2005 NASA repeated the same error regardless of many failed at- tempts to launch the space vehicle. As expect foam from the fuel tanker damager the shuttle forcing astronauts to take an historic unplanned space walk costing millions of dollars for the tax payers once more and risking another disaster. When will NASA learn? Marine life sharks, whales etc may also beach themselves due to Mercury retro - grade affecting their natural inborn navigational systems. All these malevolent predictions and waste of lives and equipment do not have to occur. Those pre - dictions do not have to affect you directly as they unfold. Instead, they are printed to prepare you for setbacks and frustrations, thus advising you to be pa - tient and prudent during this trend. There is no room for ignorance, and those who are not aware of the celestial order, including the NASA space-program management team, will continue to pay a heavy price. In all mankind’s affairs, ig - norance is true evil. Why any scientists who are against my research do not honor the word science, which is based upon solid investigation, is solid proof of mental snobbery. By omitting any physical or spiritual laws can only bring pen - alty; for science’s purpose is to explore all possibilities, even those laws written in light via the stars.

Family and Friends: Friends will be active and many will be requesting your pres - ence. Do not refuse invitations. The waxing Moon through your great friends can still grant many of your wishes. You may plan to throw your own party with some good friends this weekend. Keep your eyes open for an older person with good deals or kind words to offer.

Don’t let other people’s trouble upset you, and all will be fine. Love Affairs: Socialize with friends and have faith in the stars. You will feel posi- tive away from home with the people around you. They will enjoy your company and one of your wishes may come true. Avoid impulsive actions where romance is concerned and drive carefully on your way back home during the late hours.

Progressive changes are ahead; be patient and participate in life. If you were born in August, someone born in April, or an Aquarius or Gemini could be strongly attracted to you.

Neptune the planet of illusion is presently cruising through the futuristic sign of Aquarius. This ad - vanced sign will help man free him from fears and deceiving religiously doctrines and help him to refuse to advocate or expect apocalyptic disasters. We are the masters of our destiny, and the positive trend of your thoughts will further your and others’ lives. The future is nothing other than the reincarnation of your thoughts and we are all responsible for your own reality. Do not join or pro- mote the thought poisoning processes generated by many unaware young souls. Responding to Pluto’s position in religious Sagittarius, another wave of re-born evangelists will take to the bullhorn, using the “last days” of the Apocalypse to make fortunes by deceiving the uninformed, God-fearing religious masses. On the positive and artistic side, combined with Uranus’ electronic ingeniousness in Aquarius, Neptune (movies) in Aquarius (the future) will promote a serious in- crease in creativity, involving more electronic sub-realities within the cinematog- raphy industry. The “Titanic” and “Jurassic Park” movies are good examples, and represent some incredible electronic advances. On a higher note, real spiri- tual leaders will begin to transform Neptune’s illusive/pious vibrations into a more and rational advanced Uranian oriented generation.

A friend born in June might fall for you. Travel and Communication: A business trip or an invitation may lead you to many good contacts from the past. However, you might have problems getting to the given address and may get lost a few times. Be patient, as you will still have plenty of time to play and enjoy yourself with various unusual people. For paranormal investigators, now is the time to look for UFOs in secluded places. Don’t forget your video camera; you may be sorry if you are not ready when Uranus is willing to display the secret of extraterrestrial intelligence. Stay clear from tall trees and posts to avoid lightning; many people met with their deaths in stormy Uranus trends. Environment: General electronic failures or viruses could produce aeronautic disasters soon.

Work, Career and Business : The worst of both of these planets is to be expected mainly due to the waning Moon (negative) and the negative Supernova window in action. Do not fall for depression or self-defeating attitudes. You may com- municate your feelings but avoid uncontrolled imagination. The stars have a specific role to play in your life and you are the actor. Go with the trend, do not force issue, be patient and further your business life after the next New Moon. At work keep a low profile, your co-workers or your boss may not be aware of the work of the Moon on their psyches, and may become “lunatic” towards you. Keep busy and rearrange your desk or your paper work. Partnerships: If you want to save a difficult business relationship, now is the time to use full diplomacy and understanding. And with affairs of the heart, use Ve- nus’ loving touch; you could apologize with some flowers or a romantic dinner. Take serious precautions if you happen to be in the road as Mercury could mean impatience and speed. Family and Friends: Expect disturbing news involving friends, brothers or sisters and take the time to reply to the mail. If you get caught on the telephone, steer the discussion towards a positive tone. Mercury rules communication and will help you pass on your thoughts deeply and correctly. Again, provide a helping hand, but do not let abusive or depressing friends take the best of your own spirit. Love Affairs: Many will feel the disheartening energy of the waning moon. Se - cret love affairs may be started. However, do not expect this undercover rela - tionship to stay a secret for long. A love affair started now could have a dramatic impact in your life.

J uly 23, 2006 — Mars enters Virgo: Virgo rules health, paperwork, details and general organization. Mars in Virgo produces a strong desire towards perfection in all areas of the subject’s life. Mars in the sign of Virgo breed’s workaholics, due to the ‘service principle’ found in this sign. The strong desire for perfection and accuracy can also bring stress and disagreement with co-workers. On a more positive note, Mars in Virgo will gear the soul towards health and organi- zational endeavors. Remember Mars is the desire principle. On the medical as- pect of Astropsychology Virgo rules the cleansing process and the digestive tract. Virgo rules anything to do with elimination and cleansing. Mars also rules sharp instruments used in surgical procedures. This position produces de- tail-oriented and precise surgeons. On a negative note Mars in Virgo generates problems on the lower abdomen or intestines, which could require surgery. The digestive tract might be sensitive to changes in diet, especially by becoming a vegetarian or when certain foods are omitted such as red meat. In some ex - treme cases Mars accentuates a strong desire for virginity (Virgo is the Virgin Mary). The desire for sexual abstinence brings about chastity and translates into the idea of a nun marrying a deity such as Jesus. By doing so the subconscious Martian desire for purity is then established. SAT., SUN., MON., TUE., WED. — JULY 22, 23, 24, 25, 26.

News pertaining to the police force will always appear during his ruling days. I can hear Police Executives of the future, in the training Academy warning their officers of the impact of the power of Pluto and how vulnerable they all are under his destructive jurisdiction. Once the system catches up to my advanced perception of the human psyche outside of the limited field of today’s research, I can foresee the use of Astrology in the police force. They so desperately need this knowledge to pinpoint suspects by using the natal profiles. The impact of Pluto to a sensitive house may predispose the suspect for murder. Most of all, in the name of ignorance, many brave public servants won’t have to waste their precious lives. Time will tell. Environment: Keep in mind that Pluto does not care much about the New Moon and could disturb the earth’s belly, producing a bad earthquake. On my newsgroup weeks before the following events, I had posted this note and qua- train. “Please make a note and save this post and explore my predictions on the given dates: May 11 th ,18 th ,24 th , and 30 th , 1998. ‘The tenth day and when the moon will shine in her fullest, in the month of the Bull.

In this case the sheer will for life did the horrible trick. The Moon was New when the plane crashed and is the only reason why a few “lucky” people survived Pluto’s deadly will. Do NOT TRUST any strangers now, as Pluto stirs man’s ani - mal tendencies. Pluto rules the crooks and the cops, or the infinite forces of good and evil constantly teasing each other. Thus the villains will become more active and the police will be busy trying to stop them. Of course if you are a Po - lice officer and on duty now, don’t take chances and let your fellow officers know about Pluto’s jurisdiction of the police force.

Listen to intangible impulses from a different plane than the physical before making important deci - sions. Avoid insecurity and imagination blurring your vision or your faith during this trend. Neurotic tendencies and depression come from a heavy Neptune in anyone’s chart; use your will and see the bright side of your business life.

Keep emotions in control; use plenty of patience and diplomacy with co-workers or the boss at work. Try to concentrate on the future. Partnerships: Mars is called the “Lord of war” for good reasons. Do not let him aggravate a situation, as this could hurt a friend or a loved one. The purpose of Starguide is to teach you firm control over the stars and to manage positively the outcome of any situation. If you know someone who needs help, offer this book as a birthday present.

You should be confident no matter what, as your will (the part of God in you) is still stronger than the Moon.

Mention my work to your friend by suggesting www.drturi.com and let them learn about real as- trology. You may also offer him a copy of the current Starguide Moon Power for his birthday. Environment: We are still in a waxing moon period, but let’s hope that Pluto won’t stir a tragedy with nature’s devastating forces like an earthquake or a series of floods. Anything dramatic can happen now; let’s pray for the victims of the planet of death. If you are a law enforcement officer or a security guard, be ex- tremely cautious, as violent and dangerous karmic souls will roam the streets. Remember, the Rodney King beating also took place under Pluto, and those who lost control over their emotions will have forever to pay the ultimate price. The legacy of this action that took place on that night transformed later on into the Los Angeles riots where disorder and fires ruled the nights. Be ready for news such as Sept.14, 1999 - - Hurricane Floyd tore through the Bahamas on Tues - day, uprooting trees, shearing off roofs and hurling debris into buildings as frightened tourists and residents hunkered down in shelters or barricaded houses to wait out the monstrous storm. Famous Personalities: Lots of people die under Pluto’s rule and those who had a significant life will also have a significant departure from this world. The same energy may also remove a famous public figure in a secret way where drugs, sex, and rock and roll are never far away. Eldridge Cleaver, the 1960s Black Panther activist and fugitive who later swung to the other side of the political spectrum to become a Republican, died at the age of 62 under a Plutonic trend. Pluto rules the police force and brings the hidden facts to life. There can be a form of re - birth, a new part of life for the parties involved and for some, million-dollar law - suits! 218 Moonpower Stargate 2006"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"Events: This is a particularly destructive time, even in a good Moon, and I want you to be aware of everything around you and your loved ones. Under Pluto’s power, May 1997, a brutal slaying follows a beer drinking in Central Park, New York. Two teenagers stabbed a real estate agent at least 30 times and tried to chop off his hands so police couldn’t use fingerprints to identify him before dumping him in a lake in Central Park. The perpetrators, Daphne Abdela, 15, and her boyfriend, 15-year-old Christopher Vasquez, “gutted the body so it would sink.” Both of those young souls were born in the dramatic Pluto “Death Wish Generation.” See Pluto’s impact upon generations or order any of my two new books “And God Created the Stars” and “The Power of the Dragon” to learn more about this phenomenon. On 12/26/05 Pluto was stopped just in time. Some unlucky souls will have to undergo sorrow and loss such as those 3 kids mentioned above. Be ready to help those in need as the favor may hit close to home. Expect the weather to be harsh and crime to be high such as ‘Calm’ gun - man walks into church, kills 7 before committing suicide on September 16, 1999 - — Police on Thursday sought a motive for the nation’s latest killing rampage, a shooting spree that began when a man spewing anti-Baptist rhetoric burst into a church service for teen-agers and opened fire.

Giving and receiving plants or flowers are on the agenda for some. You may also decide to invest in some good deals with clothing. Souls born now will be quite critical in matters related to love. They will concentrate and achieve perfection in many of their artistic endeavors. Many of them will strive to find a “perfect” and hard working partner willing to exchange a love/career relationship in their lives. Some will have to learn to be less critical of the world around them in order to avoid loneli- ness. This position makes for one of the most practical and enjoyable business or emotional partners. Usually a gift in dealing with details and an interest in health matters are present with this position. These souls are born to experi- ence love on a practical level.

Be ready for anything to happen these days and accept the challenges with a sunny disposition. A beginning and ending of an important phase of your life is about to take place. Many ingenious ideas of rebuilding or investing will come to fruition during this trend. Partnerships: Like Pluto, Uranus is a rebel and he likes to destroy relationships, so caution is also advised in all you do or say to others. Be patient or suffer the consequences of impetuosity.

A chance to find love or reach a dream will be given to you if you try hard enough. You may encounter funny people or be involved in strange situations; make the most of it. If you were born in June, a Li - bra or a Sagittarius will want to know you. Travel and Communication: Your desire to travel will become intense. Some will plan a very long trip by airplane. As always, make your plans and try to travel af - ter the New Moon. Be gentle with words and realize your inner mental power; promote your future. Remember, the future is the reincarnation of all your thoughts and you may use the universal mind to influence your fate. Knowledge is power. Environment: I have noticed also that the sudden release of Uranus’ energy has in the past produced serious explosions and terrible accidents such as the US shuttle explosion, so be aware of his discharging power. Both US attacks on Iraq happened under his command and I wonder if our Presidents were just lucky or if they follow the advice of wise astrologers! Remember, Uranus rules the future; computers, avionics, atomic and aeronautics, and both wars were very much “electronics-oriented with the introduction of the Patriot missiles.” Keep in mind that Uranus also rules earthquakes and volcanoes; many surprising things take place on these particular days. Be ready for the ending of important phases of your life and expect the government to make serious decisions pertaining to other countries. Japan, France and China will be on the news soon. Expect news such as September 20, 1999 - 6:01 p.m. ET when a powerful earthquake rock - eted Taiwan, toppling buildings and knocking out power across the island. The U.S. Geological Survey measured this quake at a preliminary magnitude of 7.6. A series of aftershocks added to the chaos. Famous Personalities: Many “crazy” souls will fall for Uranus’ desire for original - ity and some will do all they can to make weird news. Famous people will be caught doing silly things, such as a movie star slapping a police officer, or a well-known actor caught having sex in a car with a prostitute, not to mention a famed British singer caught doing weird things in a public restroom. Japanese and French personalities may also make the news. Some scientists will gain fame for their accomplishments. 222 Moonpower Stargate 2006"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"Events: During a Saturn (traditions) and Uranus (changes) trend, Iranian voters stunned the experts and their country’s conservative rulers by choosing as pres - ident a man who is considered open-minded, intellectual and tolerant.

Don’t let them waste too much of your time talking or complaining over the telephone. If you feel blue yourself, know that it is Neptune’s deceiving power and use your will to fight him. At home, stimulate love and attention to the ones around you and be careful of fire (Mars) or water (Neptune). As always, don’t overindulge in alcohol, as it will only make things worse. Narcotics will only further those gloomy thoughts of your past and promote accidents. A trip to the local playhouse or a Movie The- ater may be just what your soul needs for inspiration. For those with a laid-back attitude, some good tunes and a walk by the ocean will do the trick. Get close to God and meditate about your life in general; Neptune may reward you magically. Love Affairs: Under Neptune’s auspices, secret love affairs flourish. Whatever you choose to do, make a solid decision about your own relationship and be aware of deception. Aggressive Mars may stimulate your desire for action; dancing and music would be a good outlet. Mars is far from being diplomatic; use gentleness if you intend to have a smooth evening. If you were born under the sign of Virgo, a Pisces or a Taurus needs your help. Travel and Communication: Use Neptune’s dreamy nature, and consider spend - ing time by the water away from the city’s stressful activities. If you have to drive a long way, remember to take plenty of rest beforehand, because dreamy Nep - tune could make you sleepy. Some will have to take a trip to the hospital to visit a person. Others may hear deceiving news about a legal decision pertaining to arrest and imprisonment. Come clear with what you mean these days and con - trol your imagination. Watch your possessions.

October / November: Third SUPERNOVA window - From Saturday October 21 st through Tuesday October 21 st 2006. EXPLANATION OF A SUPERNOVA WINDOW There is a celestial concentration of negative celestial energy bombarding the earth for a few weeks. Be extremely prudent in driving, and expect chain-reac- tion accidents. Be prepared for delays, strikes, and nature producing awful weather, including hurricanes and tornadoes. The same energy that produced the Titanic disaster, the Northridge, Los Angeles, and Kobe, Japan, earthquakes is approaching again. Double-check all your appointments, and if you can, post - pone traveling and flying during this Supernova “window”. Communication and electricity will be cut off, and a general loss of power is to be expected. Appliances, computers, telephones, planes, trains, cars, all of these “tools” will be affected by this energy. They will be stopped in one way or another. The people of the past will make the news and will reenter your life. Ex - pect trouble with the post office, education, students, strikes, prisoners’ escape, newspapers, broadcasting industries and computer viruses may bother us again. Many a failed mission and expensive electronic equipment (Mars probe etc.) and our tax dollars have been wasted because of the scientist’s lack of knowledge of the stars. As usual NASA, which is not aware of the science of astrology, will waste our tax money with failed missions due to bad weather and electronic mal - functions.

Again in July 2005 NASA repeated the same error regardless of many failed at - tempts to launch the space vehicle. As expect foam from the fuel tanker damager the shuttle forcing astronauts to take an historic unplanned space walk costing millions of dollars for the tax payers once more and risking another disaster.

There is no room for ignorance, and those who are not aware of the celestial order, including the NASA space-program management team, will continue to pay a heavy price. In all mankind’s affairs, ig- norance is true evil. Why any scientists who are against my research do not honor the word science, which is based upon solid investigation, is solid proof of mental snobbery. By omitting any physical or spiritual laws can only bring pen- alty; for science’s purpose is to explore all possibilities, even those laws written in light via the stars.

Travel and Communication : As you know, Pluto rules passion, the crooks and the police force. News pertaining to the police will always appear during his rul - ing days. It is my aspiration with my students and my books, to communicate this knowledge in the future to the police academies. Pluto’s impact upon our courageous police officers is lethal; and in the name of ignorance from their su- periors, many suffer early and wasteful deaths. In the future, when “ridicule” is cast aside, Police Executives will be forewarning their officers to the influence of the Plutonic impact upon their dangerous careers. Locating the destructive power of Pluto transpiring in the natal profile of a potential murderer can be identified with Astropsychology. Knowledge is power and there is no room for ignorance especially with the police force. Environment: Pluto will induce drama and could disturb the earth’s belly, pro- ducing a bad earthquake.

CNN 03/29/05 - In - donesian officials report 330 people are dead on the islands of Nias and Simeulue off Sumatra from Monday’s quake. Famous Personalities: A famous personality will be called to God and many will miss the soul.

November 24, 2006 — Jupiter enters Sagittarius: Pluto moved from Scorpio to Sagittarius on November 11 th , 1995 and will stay in this sign until January 26, 2008. Constrained to face the horrible consequences of his own destructive power, and pay the heavy consequences of mass destruction, man turns to reli- gion for comfort. In Sagittarius (religion) Pluto (regeneration) did promote a se- rious disturbing wave of religious fanaticism that plagued the world with many terrorists’ attacks. In the US, the impact of Pluto in Sagittarius has already spo - ken with some religious fanatics, committing serious crimes and many will have to pay the ultimate price for their destructive behavior.

Some will be attracted to the professions offering intellectual abilities such as the min- istry, teaching and writing, and some will be investing in education for the well being of animals. Spiritual talents involving the new age will lead these souls to- wards positions of authority and respect. This position makes for either one of the most intellectually advanced or religious dogmatic signs of the Zodiac. The soul must avoid being righteous to others and must often endure the poisoning of an overly religious upbringing.

Love Affairs: Secret affairs of sex and passion may be divulged to the public, forcing people to take a stand in destroying and rebuilding relationships. This might happen to you too. In any case use tons of diplomacy to save unwanted trouble in your love life. If you are a water sign or have any planet in Scorpio, be ready for a wake-up call of some form. Stay clear of any new relationship and stick with the old one or refrain from social interaction until the New Moon and you will be safe. Travel and Communication: Expect news pertaining to secrets, sex, the police force, and medical discoveries. Be careful of what you do or say during this trend. Drive carefully; stay clear of strangers and strange places. Be ready for dramatic news to disturb the media. Environment: Pluto will have fun destroying it all, remember he belongs to the divine celestial family and has a specific work to do. His dramatic impact on earth (and people) is needed. What Pluto demolishes he also gives the opportu- nity to rebuild even stronger and better. Be ready for dramatic news with the po - lice and nature’s forces soon. From: Thu, 1 May1997 23:43:29-0500(CDT)- To: drturi@inetworld.net - Subject: Earthquakes Dear Dr. Turi, I posted a note on alt.astrology that cited the 6.7 quake off the coast of Mexico in the Pacific Ocean. I included it under the rather “nasty” piece of mail that someone sent indicating that they believed your window of probability for April 30 to be invalid. Not that I think you need defending, as I have found your work very compel - ling. I just thought I’d let you know — in case you didn’t — that you were “right again.” On the late night of April 30, the 6.7 quakes took place. — Mary.

Jupiter, the planet of codifi - cation of thought, rules this sign. Affairs of religions, foreigners and the forma - tion of new laws will be on the rise. Expect news coming from foreign powers, forcing many governments to take secret drastic actions. This trend will play an important part on the religious front and could directly affect the Pope. Many people and countries may be forced to realize the hard lessons of religious free - dom as dramatic changes are taking place. The emphasis is on abortion rights, foreigners, and religious values. The potential for rebirth is from newfound wis - dom to perform and live accordingly with the rest of the world. Don’t fall for the apocalyptic preachers’ religious poisoning.

Family and Friends: An opportunity to meet with some family members or friends you have not seen for a while will be given to you by this lunation. The past will come alive again and a great time is offered to all. The children will have a blast on Xmas day enjoying their new toys.

Love Affairs: Be ready for the incredible to happen; if you are in a karmic rela- tionship changes may be forced upon you and are needed. Friends may fall in love with other friends or mistake love for friendship. An old love or a past friend will reappear in your life soon and with him the option to start fresh again. If you were born under one of the earth signs, expect good surprises and great changes. If you are a Sagittarius, a Leo friend needs to talk to you and someone born in April or February needs to go places with you. A friend born in June might fall for you. Travel and Communication: A business trip or an invitation may lead you to many good contacts from the past. However, you might have problems getting to the given address and may get lost a few times due to the Supernova window afflicting the world. Be patient, as you will still have plenty of time to play and enjoy yourself with various and unusual people. For UFO investigators, now is the time to look for UFO’s in secluded places. Don’t forget your video camera; you may be sorry if you are not ready, as Uranus is now willing to display secrets of extraterrestrial intelligence. Expect things in the sky or NASA to make the news. Environment: A nasty virus could produce an aeronautic disaster soon. Expect this type of news to happen: Australian wildlife officials made repeated attempts to prevent up to 300 long-finned pilot whales from beaching themselves on a remote part of Australia’s west coast.

MON., TUE, WED. — DECEMBER 25, 26, 27: RULERS — Neptune (Christmas), Mars (Religious Wars) and Venus (Affection) Work, Career and Business: This trio will make life quite interesting for the last few days of the year. Neptune’s blurring nature may affect your judgment. Be practical in all of your expectations. If a business is not doing well, you might be going the wrong way. Use all those above-mentioned planets to look for the right one for help. With the good Moon around, the opportunity might be in your local newspaper; take the time to cruise through it. Communicate your de- sires to whoever can help. Partnerships: As always with Neptune, come clear with what you mean. Some people could be deceiving; ask pertinent questions and watch their reactions. Be ready to support depressed partners, but don’t let their problems affect your judgment and feelings. A trip to Hawaii or an exotic place is in store for the lucky souls. A contract may be offered; sign it before the Full Moon. Family and Friends: Pisces rules deception, religions and will support the Christ- mas spirit all over the world. The world id still very young and the God fearing uneducated mass need all sorts of dogmas to face the hard facts of life. Many Christians and Muslims all over the world have died and will continue to die be - cause of their religions but the world is slow to learn. The age of Aquarius is slowly changing mankind consciousness where the realization of Universal love and universal awareness is the only way to bring security peace and respect to this young world and its inhabitants.

This trend will be an interesting one where friends and family members will try to get in touch with you all at the same time. This trio may drive you crazy with many projects.

You may use this lunation to perhaps resolve con- flicts in a difficult situation with a person of authority or a co-worker. Control Mars’ opposing tendencies; don’t let him affect your words, your attitude or your emotions. Practice patience during this Martian trend and use diplomacy; if you do so you’ll make serious progress. You may also use the tough energy of Mars to do some needed tasks around the office such as removing furniture; in any case, don’t get hurt. Partnerships : Even with the Waxing Moon, learn to keep Mars’ impatience un - der control and use Venus’ diplomatic gifts to save difficult situations. Everyone is so intent on having his or her own way and there could be little cooperation around you. It’s time to practice tact with the same dedication as a diplomat. Impatience could be detrimental to you and others, so use the knowledge found in this publication accordingly.

Expect much from Christmas night out on Friday or Saturday if you take a chance on someone. Enjoy social life but don’t drink and drive.

If you are a Gemini, then Aquarius, Sagittarius and Libra will be strongly attracted to you. A friend born in April has a surprise for you. Travel and Communication: Be vigilant if you must drive, and don’t take chances on the road, as Mars’ energy could make you careless. Don’t let his aggressive nature make you complain about a person, and use your words cautiously. Venus has much more to offer, and it’s your choice; so use your will and your knowl- edge. Many people from your past will be there, have fun make the most of the holiday season. Environment : Some people will learn about fire the hard way. However, many thoughtful people will use Mars’ power to further environmental knowledge on preventing fires in nature. As usual, Mars, the red and violent planet, doesn’t seem to care much for the waxing moon or Christmas. He may decide to pull a nasty trick with nature’s devastating forces, where all the elements could be in- vited for a destructive dance. Explosions and fires are common during his reign, be aware. Famous Personalities: The oblivious rich and famous may be Mar’s victims or make sad news involving accidents, drugs or alcohol. On a positive note, Venus will shine and induce love to those often-lonely famous souls. The poor kids will benefit for the season. Events : The Martian energy is tough and has in the past produced explosions and accidents of all sorts; be prudent. Venus will put up a serious fight against her destructive brother and may save many souls. Violent and dangerous sports will attract many people challenging their respective sides. Some unsuspecting souls may fall victim to Mars, and suffer head injuries. Shopping: It’s your last chance to do late shopping for the festivities. Invest in anything involving love, creativity or the arts. Show for whom you someone you care, the depth of your love.

Well let’s be practical and in the process you will save precious time and a lot of money. There are many good reasons why you should take the course by mail, mostly because you do not need to be present for me to bring forth your cosmic consciousness. Taking the live course means taking off from work and flying to where I will be teaching. This is not only time consuming but very costly and often impossible for many of you. Thus I came up with the simple idea to always record my very last advanced class and make it available to students living far away or outside the US. Many of you may think, but I would rather be present at the class and I am sure I could learn faster and better. Wrong! Again many of the questions you may have for me have al - ready been asked by some of my smart students. Any student of the stars received my answers and you will learn much more by listening to the twelve ninety minute audio tapes in your own time. For those of you who are visual; the simple but elaborate astrological symbols 290 Moonpower Stargate 2006"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"in the printed material, books and videos are designed to help you to assimilate my teachings to the highest level. Taking the physical course is also much more expensive than the significant deal by mail and time is the essence for all of us. Also, if your natal Mercury (as - similation of information/learning process) is in a slow sign, you will need much more time to assimilate the information and you can al - ways play the tape back as many times as needed. Other advanced students are also there to give you a hand by email if needed. In the physical course, you will be left behind if you can not grasp some - thing right away as time is the essence and mastering the Universal Mind in a few days could be stressing because it is quite a lot of study. You can do all that in the privacy and security of your home and take all the time you need to learn at your own pace. Your exam question - naire requires also a specific time and after a few hours that’s it; you must remit the paper work for grading. At home you can take all the time you need and no one will rush you, you can also review your tapes if you are not sure of a question. The best part is that; I am constantly learning more and more as the months go by and with your help, you may be able to assist me to come to you. Note also that many of my best students want to keep up with my latest astro- logical information. Then in time, and with your assistance, I will be teaching in your area and you can still take the course again for a fraction of the price. Thus you would get the famous two for one deal and you do not waste precious time. If you are serious about mastering the secret of the Universal time you do not want to waste away your inner drive and make a commitment to learn all about the divine as soon as pos - sible. The stars naturally will induce a strong urge to do so and this is when the same stars will assist you to master the secret of the Uni - versal clock. The quicker you start your study, the faster your new life and inner mission will take shape. Be a promoter of the future and help the children of tomorrow to live a more secure and pro - ductive life. Your contribution as a light worker will also bring an in - credible karma for your next reincarnation. It an honor for me to teach you all that I know about the universal mind and point out the marvel of the stars’ impact upon mankind on earth. I will also thank you for electing me to do so and lead the way to your new life and consciousness.

Even though I am an astrologer myself, I found the course useful for talking to people from an astrological point of view by just knowing their month of birth. Cheers, — Gerald Do this course and stop wasting your time, energy and money! Dr Turi has created a great, accurate, affordable new experience for any student of astrology whether you are a proficient or novice student of the ancient cosmology school. The course is audio, very clear and revelent. You are placed in the first day of a class where you are learning with those of simular interests, while being in the comfort of your own home, office or other enviornment. This is discussion of griot teaching, where ASTROLOGY is freely spoken. Dr. Turi a native of France discusses the divine astrology used by ancient seers to counsel the aristocracy and nobility of those times. Nostradamus the great prophet used a particular sys- tem of which Dr. Turi is the expert for our times, (he is also a son of Provence, France the birth place of Nostradamus.) Learning by hearing, remembering, speaking the spiritual science of Divine Astrology, Astro Psychology, and the balance of the mystical path of the major and minor arcane known as tarot, Dr. Turi’s stu - dents are being equipped with all the tools they will need to under - stand mysteries transformed into useful powers and practice.Sign by sign, house by house, relationship by relationship until the process of life, death and rebirth are well communicated, received and un - derstood. You will find Dr. Turi ripping past the norm and opening your eyes to the reality that once looked only like a possibility. Reincarnation is discussed and Dr. Louis Turi discusses what prog - ress is all about how the soul journeys and how karmic debt is col - lected or repaid. Fascinating lectures, additionally speak of the beastly powers of organized crime, government, media, religion, military, education and medicine and what you and I can do to bring enlightenemt, balance and harmony in spite of the chaos so many are living through to our lives.There is follow up by email, newletters, forum that help support your studies.

C’est magnifique! — Dr. Cheryl Golden. What I liked best about this course is Dr. Turi’s eagerness to share his knowledge. He has a generosity of spirit to get this information out into the world. To do that, he has had to develop a method using metaphor and symbolism that would enable ordinary folks to grasp the message quickly so as to be able to apply it accurately in a way to improve life. I suspect this has cost him more than people realize in terms of time, commitment, energy and perhaps even ridicule and danger. For that, I thank him.

I was very fortunate in finding your book “The Power of the Dragon”! You have taught me so much, and I just wanted to write to say I am so grateful to you. I have been studying astrology for 18 years and have been toying with the idea of using the solar chart as well as the Placidus system and you confirmed my thoughts that it is correct but to use the zero point instead of the sun degree. I have seen it work with many charts correctly. I also am thankful for your teachings of the nodes as most astrolo - gers do not really understand them well and some do not even focus on them much going so far as not even putting the south node in the chart which I have never understood. You have given me so much and I am eternally thankful to you. — Mary Kanz Cedar Rapids, IA 298 Moonpower Stargate 2006"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"Hello Dr. Turi, Hi, this is Veronica (aka january) how are you, and your girls do - ing??? hope fine, Ihad to write to you, because your class was one of the most intense and exiting experiences I ever had!!! Also, some - thing amazing happened. after graduating, Laurent and I went to a restaurant to have lunch, and to celebrate our accomplishment. And you won’t believe what happened. There was a lady talking on the phone (she seemed to know the people who work there, or maybe she was one of the owner’s, because she was on the bussiness phone). She was yelling like a crazy woman, and crying. Curiously, Laurent and I were the only two clients there at the time, and couldn’t help but to get a bit irritated by that screaming crazy lady. I kept on looking back at her to see what the hell was going on. And suddenly, she was in front of us, calling us names for even doing eye contact. She asked if she could sit and I moved over offering her a seat right next to me. She sat, I could see without a doubt that she was in such pain, it hurt, I could feel it too!!! I was just about to talk to her, when Laurent, who was afraid of her and what she could do, told her to get up and leave us alone. She did. Then Laurent and I guessed she must be a Pisces, and have some strong planets such as Mars and Mercury in her sun sign and first house. After a couple of minutes, she came back, and apologized for being rude. She ex- plained that her husband was filing for divorce, and that he is getting the kids. she loves her kids and that she needed them in her life. I moved over once again and looked at Laurent. He offered her a seat, and we both decided to do her chart to help her out with her situation. Well, I just happened to have my ephemeris with me (we just picked it up after class- before going to the restaurant). So we pulled out her planets, and guess what??? She was a Pisces with Ve - nus and Mercury in her 1st house, in addition to that she had Sat - urn!!! WOW!! I asked her if her ex-husband was a foreigner (because the tail of her dragon was in Sagittarius) and she said yes. We tried to explain to her that she shouldn’t drink ( she was soooooooooooooo drunk ) because she had Neptune (deception) in her 9th house of foreigneers in Scorpio!!! She also had Libra in her 8th house of life and death!!! She also had Pluto (danger), Mars(agressiveness), and Uranus (unusual way of expressing one - self) in her 7th house of marriage in Virgo. But unfortunately she be - ing drunk, and having Taurus in her 3rd house of the mind didn’t help us much because she would interrupt us constantly, and was soooo stuborn about letting go of her relationship, keeping sober, and fighting for her kids. Interesting enough the moon was in Libra Ordering Courses or Services 299"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"(contracts and relationships), the moon will be in Scorpio today, which means her Neptune planet will keep her drinking her prob - lems away, and Sunday the full moon will be in Sagittarius (her tail of the dragon). Laurent and I are completely sure she won’t make it past this sunday. She will probably kill herself. What a shame, she was a pretty girl, and looked pretty smart too (when sober). The amazing part is : 1-the universe asked us to get the ephemeris be - cause this was going to happen, 2-we saw her problems as clear as water, 3-this was such a test of our abilities and our passion for help - ing people and bringing the light.

THANKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! — WITH LOVE VERONICA (JANUARY) Hi Veronica, Dr. Turi sent me your email. I want to add that this is the beauty of his work. It opens the intuitional domain. I have done that many times—guessed some planet in a sign, by the way a person be- haved. When you think about how remarkable that is, to know what planet was in which constellation in the sky at the moment of a per- son’s birth, is truely a signal that Astropsychology is absolutely real, and works. When Dr. Turi says this class will “open your third eye” and give you “cosmic consciousness”, he is NOT KIDDING!!! What a great story — Madeline Dear Dr. Turi, I cannot express in enough words how I enjoyed your class. I did not want it to end. I could have gone on another week. I was not ready to leave. I had to leave right after the test to catch my plane at the airport. I looked for you to say good bye, but you had gone. The only thing I regret is that I missed the Jordan Maxwell lecture Friday, because I got lost and could not find the conference hall. I learned more about astrology from your class, than I have learned over the last 35 years. I will never go back to conventional astrology. You are an excellent teacher.

Love & light — Alice Brooks To all prospective Astropsychology students; It has now been one week since I have completed Dr. Turi’s ad - vanced astrology course in Phoenix AZ. It has been about five months since I passed his basic astrology class by mail. I am here to state that I absorbed so much more information and reflex in five days of hands on schooling, than I could ever imagine getting in months of home study. Don’t get me wrong, the home course I hold very dearly, and It was an excellent prerequisite, and I highly recom - mend it, but it only put me on the runway, where as traveling to AZ. to get hands on schooling, placed me in the air. I guess it depends on what you want to do with the knowledge, and how fast you want to do it. Myself I planned to make a career out of it, and I knew that the home course would eventually produce those results. Now hav- ing completed the advanced course, I now face that reality. My new career has now sprouted, and I owe it all to one incredible man, Dr. Louis Turi. There are not enough kind words to describe this incred- ibly gifted, spiritual pioneer. To be taught by him is a great honor, and pure enlightenment. There is no doubt that you will notice that he has a little something different to offer, something you won’t find anywhere else. With that I leave it up to you, the prospective student to find that answer. Thank You, — Charles Hi Dr. Turi, There is a driving force of energy that moves and propels us in our quest for the truth, and the truth does not lie in any one area. This truth that the seeker seeks, lays scattered through out our planet. So we as we seek must be patient and discerning when we come across the path of others speaking the truth. And from my discernment and the trust of my heart, I feel very fortunate and blessed to have crossed paths with Dr. Turi in this time of life. Dr. Turi’s wisdom and understanding is a vast as the stars he speaks of. I am thankful that 304 Moonpower Stargate 2006"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"we taped the seminar!

My birthday is ///, I have the stars to teach astrology and that is what I want to do, I do it all day long for everyone around me I can’t help myself, I see it in the news, the weather, everything everywhere, my cats and dogs, it’s wonderful. It is nice to know who you are dealing with, where is Nept? What will you lie about. Where is Pl. what part of your life do you rearrange all of the time. Where is Jupt. What do you want to learn and teach, where will you expand and be lucky. I have Jupt in the 1st house I want to teach. It is all so wonderful. One of these days I am going to call Jeff Rense when you are on the air and ask some general questions, so people can see how powerful it is. Wind heat and fires for the next two years. With the DT in Sag. and Pl. in Sag the list is long for what this will bring. Thank you so much Dr. Turi. — Barbara Dear Dr. Turi, After finishing your Advanced Astropsychology class, my dream state has been enhanced. I’ve always journeyed my dreams, and I can see a change of consciousness in myself. The Universal Mind has certainly come to new life. It’s exciting to meet new people and see the qualities that the stars have influenced in their lives. It helps one to have a more open mind to personality traits that would nor - mally be unpleasant, to understanding what makes people tick. For me, it has made me a more compassionate, understanding person. With the help of your teachings, I’ve learned the future is the rein - carnation of thoughts today. I’m thinking and planning my future with light and love for a beautiful new life. It is just the beginning of great things to come. Thank you for all you’ve done for me. Thank you for being such a beautiful channel of light in this world.
