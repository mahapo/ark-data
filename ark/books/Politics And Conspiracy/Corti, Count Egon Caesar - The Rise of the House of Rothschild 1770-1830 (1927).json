On the other hand, cer tain special features of the period under consideration have been, for various reasons, entirely neglected. An example of such neglect is the ignoring by histo - rians of the role played by the Rothschild family i n the history of the nineteenth century, and the object o f this work is to appraise the important influence of this family on the politics of the period, not only in Europe b ut throughout the world. For, strangely enough, the in flu- ence of the Rothschilds is barely mentioned, or at the most casually referred to, in otherwise comprehensive an d painstaking historical treatises. Special literature dealing with the House of Roths- child usually falls into one of two groups, either fulsome paeans of praise commissioned by the House itself, or scurrilous pamphlets inspired by hatred—both equall y unpleasant. There are, however, two works of seriou s value in existence, which are partially compiled fr om legal documents, but they are of small scope. One i s by an employee of the Rothschilds, Christian Wilhelm Berg - hoeffer, and the other is the impartial work of Dr. Rich- ard Ehrenberg; but these treat only of isolated inc idents in the history of the House, and throw no light on its pan-European importance. The object of the present work, which deals with th e period 1770-1830, is to trace the rise of the House of Rothschild from its small beginnings to the great p osition it attained, culminating in the year of its great c risis.

I made a point of collectin g all available data until my drawers were literally cram med with letters, deeds, and documents containing the n ame of Rothschild, and bearing dates of almost every ye ar of the nineteenth century. My next step was to visit t he various European capitals which had been the scene of the family activities, in order to enrich my store of refer- ences with all the relevant literature. The subject is in- deed inexhaustible, but the material I had amassed en- couraged me to essay a complete picture. The subject required the most delicate treatment, b ut my determination to undertake the work was accom- panied by the definite intention of according it co mplete impartiality, for I was convinced from the beginnin g that a prejudiced outlook would render the work utterly value- less. The House of Rothschild, as will be readily under- stood, did not throw open its archives to my inspec tion, for it is particularly careful in guarding its more important business secrets. But this was not entire ly with- out its advantage, for it left me completely free f rom political considerations and uninfluenced by racial , na- tional, and religious predilections or antipathies. I was thus enabled, in accordance with my wish, to begin an independent historical research into the part playe d by this House in the nineteenth century, which I knew to be far more important than is commonly thought. The general scheme of this work will be built upon facts alone, in a practical way such as will help u s to form our own judgment on individuals and the part t hey played in world events.

Now began a period of harsh oppression for the Jewish inhabitants. In order that they might be rem oved from the neighborhood of the most important church in the town, they were ordered by a law passed in the year 1462 to leave the houses they had been living in an d to settle in a quarter set aside for the purpose—the s o-called Jewish City. 1 This, however, consisted only of a single dark alley, about twelve feet broad, and lay, as de scribed by Goethe, between the city wall and a trench. For more than three hundred years this continued to be the sole residence of the Frankfort Jews, whose continu ance in the city became more and more unpopular with the other inhabitants. As early as the second decade of the seventeenth century a rising broke out under one Fe tt- milch, one of the objects of which was to drive the Jews out of Frankfort. This object was indeed achieved through murder and pillage. Although the Jews soon returned to the city, they had to submit to innumer able restrictions and regulations embodied in a special law dealing with the so-called \"Status of Jews.\" They w ere made subject to a poll-tax, and were compelled, as being a foreign element in the town, to purchase the \"pro tec- tion\" of their persons and property. Hence they cam e to be called \"protected Jews.\" The number of their fam - ilies was to be limited to five hundred and only tw elve marriages a year were allowed, although this number might be increased if a family died out. The Jews w ere not allowed to acquire land, or to practice farming or handicrafts. They were also forbidden to trade in v ari- ous commodities, such as fruit, weapons and silk.

If a Je w crossed a bridge he had to pay a fee for doing so. They were not allowed to visit public taverns and were e x- cluded from the more attractive walks in the city. The Jews accordingly did not stand high in public estee m. When they appeared in public, they were often greet ed with shouts of contempt and stones were sometimes thrown at them. Boerne has stated that any street u rchin could say to a passing Jew, \"Jew, do your duty,\" an d the Jew then had to step aside and take off his hat. Ho wever that may be, the oppressed condition of the Jews an d the bent of many of them to usury, combined with the na tural hostility of the Christians and their feeling that they were not as sharp in business, created an atmosphere of mutual hatred that can scarcely have been more painful any - where than in Frankfort. The progenitors of the House of Rothschild lived un - der conditions such as those in the ghetto of Frank fort. The earlier ancestors of Meyer Amschel Rothschild, who laid the foundations of the future greatness of the house, existed in the middle of the sixteenth century; we know their names, and their tombs have been preserved in the old Jewish cemetery at Frankfort. Formerly the hous es in the Jewish quarter were not numbered, each house being distinguished by a shield of a particular col or or by a sign. The house in which the members of the Roths - child family lived bore a small red shield. There i s no doubt that it is to this fact that they owe their f amily name; it is first mentioned in 1585 in the name \"Is aak Elchanan 2 at the Red Shield,\" his father's tombstone simply bearing the name Elchanan. About a century later Naftali Hirz at the Red Shield left the ruino us old building from which the family had derived its name , and occupied the so-called Haus zur Hinterpfann, in which the Rothschilds were now domiciled as protect ed Jews. Until the time when Meyer Amschel Rothschild—who"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"4 The Rise of the House of Rothschild was born in the year 1743, six years before Goethe— reached manhood, the family were principally engage d in various kinds of retail trade. At the beginning of the eighteenth century they had become money-changers i n a small way. From the occasional records of their t ax payments which have been preserved, it would appear that they were not a poor Jewish family, but that t hey were only reasonably well off. In any case it is clear that Meyer Amschel came int o some small inheritance when, in 1755, in his twelft h year, he lost his father and mother, of whom he was the e ldest son; this gave him the incentive to throw himself i nto the battle of life with that vigor and industry which h is parents had implanted in him in his early childhood . In the conditions of those times the struggle was cert ainly much more severe for a young Jew than for his more for- tunate Christian neighbors. When he was a boy of ten Meyer Amschel had been employed by his father in changing coins of every k ind, that is, in exchanging gold and silver for the appr opriate amount of copper known as coarse money. In the chao tic conditions prevailing in Germany—divided as the cou n- try was into innumerable small principalities, citi es and spiritual jurisdictions, all of which had their own cur- rency systems—the business of money-changing offere d magnificent opportunities of profit, since everybod y was compelled, before undertaking even the shortest jou rney, to call for the assistance of the exchange merchant . As the boy grew up, an important side interest develop ed out of this occupation, as he occasionally became p os- sessed of rare and historically valuable coins, whi ch awoke in him the instincts of the coin collector. After leaving the school at Furth, where he was edu - cated in the Jewish faith, Meyer Amschel entered th e firm of Oppenheim at Hanover.

As the general was connected with the ruling house in Hesse, this acquaintance was to have fruitful results. In his spare time Meyer Amschel now devoted himself more and more to numismatics. He got hold of any papers about the subject that he could, and in course of t ime became an expert in his subject, although his gener al education left a very great deal to be desired. At a com- paratively early age he returned to his native city of Frankfort, in order to take possession of his inher itance, and having done so, to lay the foundations of a bus iness of Ins own. For this he had received a practical educa tion from his earliest youth, both at home and at Hanove r. About the same time General von Estorff left Hanove r for the court of Prince William of Hesse, the grand son of the old Landgrave William VIII, who resided at Hesse; he proceeded to the small town of Hanau, whi ch lies quite close to Frankfort. The prince's father Fred- erick II of Hesse had married a daughter of King George III of England of the House of Hanover, and the two rulers used their family relationships to c onsoli- date their dynastic and political interests. The sa le of soldiers for service under foreign governments, pra cticed by so many German princes at this time, was an impo r- tant part of their activities; England, being parti cularly accustomed to carrying on wars with foreign mercena ries, was an exceedingly good customer. Unfortunately Frederick II fell out with his wife, his father, and his father-in-law, because he changed o ver from the Protestant to the Catholic faith. In order to protect his grandson from his father's influence th e old landgrave decided that William was to be kept away from Cassel, and allotted the county of Hanau to hi m.

The relations of the ruling House of Hesse with Eng - land and Denmark were to be fraught with the most important consequences for the rise of the House of Rothschild, which was enabled to make use of the cl ose business connection that it succeeded in establishi ng with the ruling House of Hesse, to get into touch with t he courts and the leading statesmen of Denmark and Eng - land. The old Landgrave William VIII died in 1760. Fred- erick assumed the government at Cassel, and William became crown prince; and as the bridegroom of the Danish princess he became, in accordance with the w ill of his grandfather, independent ruler of the small county of Hanau with its 50,000 inhabitants, to whose inte rests he devoted himself with the greatest zeal. William was a thoroughly active person, and was never idle for a mo- ment. He read a great deal, and actually wrote some essays on matters of local historical interest. He also tried his hand, though without any great success, a t etching, modeling and carpentering, and he had a ve ry definite flair for collecting. It would appear that General von Estorff aroused hi s ruler's interest in coin-collecting; in 1763 Willia m adopted this hobby with great enthusiasm, and it af - forded him much pleasure and satisfaction. Estorff spoke to him about Meyer Amschel Rothschild, who ha d bought coins for him in Hanover in former days, as being a great expert in that line. 3 On the strength of this intro- d u c t i o n Rothschild selected some of his finest meda ls and rarest coins, and went to Hanau to offer them t o the young prince. He did not succeed in seeing him per- s o n a l l y , but he managed to hand them to someone in the prince's immediate entourage. This offer proved to be the starting-point of a lasting business connection , even"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"The Origins of the Rothschilds 7 though at first it was of a quite loose and imperso nal nature. At that time a large number of foreigners used to v isit Frankfort every spring. The town fairs were widely famous, The latest products of the whole world were on view there, and young William of Hanau, who had a talent for business, took a special interest in the se fairs and constantly attended them. Meyer Amschel always managed to get advance information about these jour neys from the prince's servants, and profited by these o cca- sions to offer William while he was in Frankfort no t only rare coins but also precious stones and antiqu es. Although this was principally done through the prin ce's retinue, he sometimes managed to conduct these tran sac- t i o n s personally, and in any case he managed to est ablish a regular business relationship. He was fortunate i n that the prince did not share the general aversion to Jews, and appreciated anyone who seemed intelligent and g ood at business, and whom he thought he could use in hi s own interests. At that time titles and honors were of far greater prac- tical importance than they are today; unless a pers on had some kind of prefix or suffix all doors were closed to him, and everyone who did not have a title of nobility b y the accident of birth would endeavor to obtain an offic e, or at any rate an official title, from some one of the innu- merable counts or princelings who in that day still en- joyed sovereign rights. Meyer Amschel Rothschild, being a shrewd man with an astonishing knowledge of human nature for his years—he was only twenty-five— concentrated on using his connection with the Princ e of Hanau to obtain a court title. He hoped thereby not merely to raise his prestige generally, but more pa rticu- larly to advance his relations with other princes i nterested in coins. In 1769 he wrote a most humble petition 4 to the Prince of Hanau, in which, after referring to various good s"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"8 The Rise of the House of Rothschild delivered to the prince to his Highness's most grac ious satisfaction, he begged that he might \"most graciou sly be granted the advantage of being appointed court a gent.\" Meyer Amschel promised always to devote all his ene rgy and property to the prince's service, and he conclu ded his letter with a perfectly sincere statement that if he received the designation in question he hoped there by to gain business esteem, and that it would otherwise e nable him to make his fortune in the city of Frankfort. This letter, which was written in a style expressiv e of extreme humility, was the first of an almost endles s series of petitions which the various members of the House of Rothschild were to address in the course of the nin eteenth century to those occupying the seats of the mighty. Many of these were favorably considered, and assist ed no little in establishing the fortunes of that Hous e. This, the first of the series, was granted, and the nomin ation was duly carried into effect on September 21, 1769. Henceforth to the name of Rothschild was attached t he decorative suffix \"Crown Agent to the Principality of Hesse-Hanau.\" This more or less corresponded with the present-day practice under which a tradesman may display the ro yal coat-of-arms with the legend \"By special appointmen t,\" etc. It was a mere designation carrying no obligati on, and although it gave expression to the fact that a busi- ness man enjoyed the patronage of a customer in the highest circles, it did not imply any official stat us what- ever. Nevertheless this first success gave much joy to Meyer Amschel, since it not only enabled him to mak e great profits in his old coin business, but gave hi s firm a s p e c i a l prestige with the world at large, as even t he smallest prince shed a certain glamour upon all who came anywhere near his magic circle; and the Prince of H anau was grandson of the King of England, husband of the daughter of the King of Denmark, and destined to be the ruler of Hesse-Cassel."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"The Origins of the Rothschilds 9 At the age of twenty-five Meyer Amschel was a tall, impressive-looking man of pronounced Hebraic type; his expression, if rather sly, was good-natured. In acc ord- ance with the custom of those times he wore a wig, al- though, as he was a Jew, he was not allowed to have it powdered, and in accordance with the customs of his race he wore a small, pointed black beard. When he took stock of his business and his little property, he could say to himself with justice that he had not m erely administered his inheritance intelligently, but sub stan- tially increased it. Although he could certainly no t be classed amongst the wealthy men of Frankfort, or even amongst the wealthy Jews of that city, he coul d assuredly be described as well off, and was in a po sition to think of founding a family. He had been attracted for some time by the youthful daughter of a tradesman called Wolf Solomon Schnapp er, who lived not far from the Rothschilds' house in th e Jewish quarter. She was seventeen years old when Meyer Amschel courted her, had been brought up in a ll the domestic virtues, was simple and modest, and ex - ceedingly industrious, and brought a dowry with her which, though small, was in solid cash. Meyer Ams chel's marriage was celebrated on August 29, 1770. After his marriage he would have liked to move from the house zur Hinterpfann, which he rented, into a house of h is own, but he could not yet afford to do so. The youn g couple's first child, a daughter, was born as early as 1771, after which followed three boys in the years 1773, 1774, 1775, who were given the names Amschel, Solomon, an d Nathan. While his wife was fully occupied in bringing up th e children and running the house, Meyer Amschel devel - oped his business, in which his invalid brother Kal man was a partner until he died in 1782.

He sent such catalogues to Goethe's patron Duke Kar l August of Weimar, to Duke Karl Theodore of the Pala t- inate, and of course always to his own benefactor a t Hanau, 5 Prince William. The prince's mother still kept him away from his father, Landgrave Frederick, who was ruling at Cas- sel, and who made several unsuccessful attempts to get into touch with his son. William had married Prince ss Caroline of Denmark six years before Meyer Amschel' s marriage; but from the first moment of their union they had realized that they were not suited 6 to one another. Indeed so little physical or spiritual harmony was there between the young couple that their marriage might be regarded as an absolute affliction. It finally led to Wil- liam's entirely neglecting his wife and living with nu- merous favorites, who bore him children. The famili es Haynau, Heimrod, and Hessenstein are the descendant s of such unions, it being William's practice to obta in titles for his illegitimate children from the Emperor of A ustria, in return for the moneys he lent to him. It is diff icult to verify the fantastic figures 7 given as to the total num- ber of his illegitimate children; but there is no d oubt they were very numerous. When he assumed the government of his small terri- tory, William of Hanau was in a position to play th e role of absolute ruler, and his highly marked indiv idu- ality immediately made itself felt. He was insolent even with the nobility, and often observed that he did n ot like them to take advantage of any marks of familiar \"co n- descension\" 8 that he showed them. On the other hand he did not show any p r i d e in d e a l i n g with persons who he thought would serve his interests.

Under his rule the Jews enjoyed all ki nds of liberties; they did not, for instance, have to disp lay in the market signs to distinguish them from Christian tradespeople. Indeed William took pleasure in th eir marked talent for business, for in this matter he f elt him- self to be a kindred spirit. Business considerati ons gov- erned him even when he was specifically considering the welfare of his soldiers. He would concern himself with the smallest details of their equipment; would pass the new recruits, and would give precise instructions a s to the length of the pigtail to be worn. He was part icularly fond of parades, and tortured his men with drill an d but- ton-polishing. One reason he was particularly an xious that his troops should look smart was that he could make a great deal of money by following the example of h is father and grandfather in selling his men to Englan d. His father Landgrave Frederick had in this w ay gradually transferred to England 12,000 Hessians, a nd amassed an enormous fortune in the process. In th e same way William sold to England in 1776 the small Hanau regiment, which he had just formed. The condition s of such \"subsidy-contracts\" were exceedingly oppressiv e to the customer, as he had to pay substantial compensa tion for any man who was killed or wounded. The crown prince also increased his property considerably by this means. After deducting all expenses he realized a net profit of about 3,500,000 marks from this business, and there being no distinction between the public and t he private purse of a prince, this money was at his ab solute personal disposal.

As it was he found such out- let as he could for his commercial instincts within the sphere of his princely dignity. Father and son cont inued to accumulate large capital sums, and they refraine d from bringing over to the Continent substantial pro por- tions of the subsidy moneys, which they invested in Eng- land itself. The management of these funds was entr usted to the Amsterdam financial house Van der Notten. En g- land did not always pay in cash, but often in bills of exchange that had to be discounted. For this purpos e the prince and his officials had to employ suitable middle- men in large commercial centers like Frankfort; alt hough the middlemen had to get their profit out of the bu si- ness they could not be dispensed with in view of th e re- stricted means of transport and communication at th at time. Purchases and sales had to be carefully regul ated to prevent the market from being suddenly flooded w ith bills, the rate of exchange being consequently depr essed. This work fell to the various crown agents and fact ors; of these the Jew Veidel David was the principal one attached to the landgrave at Cassel, Rothschild bei ng employed only by the crown prince at Hanau, and onl y in exchange business and to a limited extent in con junc- tion with several others. His personal relation wit h the prince was at first exceedingly slender, for, howev er en- lightened he might be, a ruling prince did not easi ly asso- ciate with a Jew, and only long years of useful ser vice, acting upon a temperament such as William's, could break down such natural obstacles. In the first ins tance men of business had to deal with the crown prince's offi- cials ; to get on good terms with them was a primar y essen- tial for anybody who wanted to do business with the prince. One of the most influential members of the crown prince's civil service was an official at the treas ury called Carl Frederick Buderus. 9 He was the son of a Hanau schoolmaster, and had shown a special aptitud e"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"The Origins of the Rothschilds 13 for the duties of a careful and accurate treasury c lerk. His father had been writing- and music-master to th e children of the crown prince's mistress Frau von Ri tter- Lindenthal, ancestress of the Haynaus, and this had given him the opportunity of bringing to the crown prince 's attention a plan of his son's for increasing the mi lk profits from one of the prince's dairies by the sim ple ex- pedient of forbidding the practice, adopted by the office concerned, of omitting fractions of a heller in the ac- counts. Young Buderus showed that this would increa se the revenue by 120 thalers. This discovery appealed so strongly to the avaricious prince, who counted ever y half- penny, that he entrusted Buderus with the accounts of his private purse, in addition to his normal duties . Buderus henceforth displayed the greatest zeal in l ook- ing after the financial interests of the crown prin ce. He is generally credited with having been responsible for the introduction of the Salt Tax when the problem o f providing for the prince's innumerable natural chil dren became pressing. The resulting increase in the co st of this important article of diet was heavily felt, es pecially by the poorest inhabitants of Hesse-Cassel. There being no distinction between the public treasury and the private purse we can readily imagine how great this man's i nflu- ence as. Moreover, the officials of that period w ere al- ways personally interested on a percentage basis in the financial dealings which they carried through in th eir official capacity.

They, however, had not as yet sufficient confidence in the financial resources of the Frankfort Jew Rothschild to entrust to him anything except the smaller transact ions. Through the death of Landgrave Frederick, the crown prince suddenly succeeded to the throne of He sse- Cassel, and to the most extensive property of any G er- man prince of that period. On October 31, 1785, his father Frederick II had suddenly had a stroke durin g his midday meal and had fallen off his chair, dying a few minutes later. This news came as a complete sur - prise to the crown prince, as his father had latter ly scarcely ever been ill. William of Hanau accordingl y succeeded to the throne of Hesse-Cassel as Landgrav e William IX. On reading his father's will he learned with pleasure that the country was free of debt, an d that he had come into an enormous property. The subsidie s received for the sale of mercenaries had been most profit- ably invested, and estimates the value of the inher itance varied between twenty 10 and sixty 11 million thalers—un- paralleled sums for those times. The new landgrave united his private property at Hanau with his inherited posssessions, and now foun d himself disposing of an amount of money which con- ferred far greater power on him than his new dignit y.

But two years passed without his services being ask ed for. He stood by enviously, seeing other agents getting bills to discount, and being asked to pay interest only afte r six or eight months, or else to pay over the money in inst al- ments, an arrangement equivalent to allowing the fi rms concerned substantial free credits. Rothschild had closely followed the business dealings of these fir ms, and had thought out a very useful way of transacting su ch matters if he should be entrusted with them. He decided to pay another call at Cassel. During the summer of 1789 he wrote a letter to the landgrave 12 in which he referred to the services that he had rende red during a long course of years as Hesse-Hanau crown agent, and asked to be considered in connection wit h the bills-of-exchange business on a credit basis. In order to put himself on a level with his rivals he promised always to do business at a price at least as high as that offered by any banker in Gassel. T h e p e t i t i o n —which shows that Rothschild already had control of considerable sums of money—was sub- mitted to the landgrave by Buderus, but William dec ided that he must f i r s t obtain further information about Roths- child's business.

Nevertheless, Rothschild rec eived only a comparatively small credit transaction to ca rry out, whilst simultaneously a transaction thirty tim es as great was entrusted to Veidel David; but, though mo dest, it was a beginning. Buderus, whose position in the mean- time had been steadily increasing in importance, of ten had occassion to travel between Cassel and Frankfor t on business matters. We have evidence of the fact that as early as 1790 he had business dealings with Rothsch ild's father-in-law Wolf Solomon Schnapper, and it was Schnapper who brought him and Meyer Amschel together. Rothschild would often get advance information of Buderus's journeys to Frankfort so that he could go and see him when he came. The Hessian official heard fr om other sources in Frankfort of the clever Jew's risi ng reputation, and of how he always met his obligation s punctually. Buderus was also gradually influenced b y Rothschild's own persuasive powers. As early as Nov em- ber, 1790, Buderus's accounts contain an entry rega rding a \"draft of 2,000 Laubtaler to the order of the cro wn agent Meyer Amschel Rothschild.\" 13 Rothschild now urged Buderus, if occasion should arise, to recommend him to the landgrave for substa ntial dealings also. In 1794 an opportunity for this occu rred. The capital sums invested by Hesse in England had grown to a very considerable amount, and the landgr ave gave instructions that a portion of them should be brought over to Cassel. In addition to the Christian bankin g firm of Simon Moritz von Bethmann, which had been established in Frankfort for centuries, and four ot her firms, Buderus put forward the name of the crown agent Rothschild as suitable for carrying through t his transaction.

But it did not oc cur again. In the end Buderus's efforts were successful in overcoming the landgrave's aversion, and henceforwa rd Rothschild also was employed to an increasing exten t in discounting bills and in other business. His dealings with the court at Cassel soon became v ery active, and as Meyer Amschel carried through the ma t- ters entrusted to him, not merely conscientiously b ut with a shrewd eye to gain, the profits which he derived from them increased considerably. It was necessary fo r the young household that business should be brisk, for in 1788 another son, Carl Meyer, was born, and in 1792 a fi fth son Jacob, called James, and Meyer Amschel's marria ge had also been blessed with five daughters. There was the large family of twelve persons to feed; however , Meyer Amschel's flourishing business was not merely adequate to support his family, but there was a con sider- able and constantly increasing surplus available for increasing his business capital. In 1785, as an o utward and visible sign of his increasing prosperity, he b ought a handsome residence, the house known as zum grunen Schild, while he transferred to a relative the hous e zur Hinterpfann in which he had lived hitherto, and whi ch he had partially purchased since being nominated cr own agend. The house into which the Rothschild family now moved is still standing almost as it was then; it i s the right half of a building comprising two quite small fam- ily dwellings, typical of the straitened circumstan ces of the Jewish quarter. Only the three left windows o f the house front belonged to the Rothschilds, and above the first door was a small, scarcely noticeable five-si ded con- vex green shield. 14 The right half of the building, known as the house zur Arche, belonged to the Jewish fami ly Schiffe, who kept a second-hand shop in it; over th e door was a small carved ship representing the boat of Columbus. 15 "},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"18 The Rise of the House of Rothschild As the door of the Rothschild house was opened, an ancient bell was set ringing, sending its warning n otes right through the house. Every step one took reveal ed the painful congestion in which the Jews of that pe riod were compelled to e x i s t , the only quarters where th ey were allowed to live being comprised within the sma ll and narrow Jews' street. Everything in the house wa s very narrow, and each particle of space was turned to account. A creaking wooden staircase, underneath wh ich cupboards had been built in, led to the upper floor , and to the little \"green room\" of Gudula, the mistress of the house, so called because the modest furniture in it was upholstered in green. In a glass case on the table was the withered bridal wreath of Meyer Amschel's wife. Let into the left wall was a small secret cupboard, con- cealed by a mirror hanging in front of it. In this matter, too, space was carefully utilized, there being cupb oards built into the wall wherever possible, such as are now coming into use again. On the ground floor was the parents' small bedroom, while the numerous children had to share one other little room. A narrow passage led to a kind of roof terrac e— a tiny roof garden with a few plants. As the Jews w ere not allowed in the public gardens this roof garden furnished a modest substitute, and served as the fa mily recreation ground. As it is laid down that the Feas t of the Tabernacle must be celebrated in the open air, and there was no other place available, the little roof garden was used for this purpose. Behind the house, and overlooking the narrow court- yard, was a room about nine feet square, which was actually the first banking house of the Rothschilds . Its most important article of furniture was a large iro n chest with an enormous padlock.

The kitchen of the house was very modest, the room being about twelve feet long and only about five feet broad; a tiny hearth, which co uld accommodate only one cooking pot, a chest, and a be nch were about all that it contained. There was one f ixture that constituted a great luxury for those times, a primitive pump which conveyed drinking water direct to the kitchen. Such was the scene of the early activities of Meyer Amschel and his sons, whose energy and enterprise l aid the foundations for the future development of t heir House. Berghoeffer's researches indicate that the annual income of the House of Rothschild, before the war period of the 1790's, may be estimated at between 2,000 an d 3,000 gulden. 16 We are better able to realize what this meant when we consider that the expenditure of Goet he's family, who were people of position, was about 2,40 0 gulden a year. On such an income it was possible to live quite comfortably at Frankfort at that time, althou gh the political disturbances which were developing soon b egan to produce their effect. Events profoundly affect ing the course of all future history had taken place. The repercussions of the French Revolution were fel t throughout Europe.

The impression gained from the sufferers themselves, the news regarding the threatened execu tion of the king and his consort, and the reports of the cruel treatment meted out to all who enjoyed princely or noble privileges caused him to tremble for his crown, as all the princes of Europe were trembling. He was also concerned about his enormous wealth, a special sour ce of danger at such a time; and he therefore did not require much pressing to join the great coalition of prince s against revolutionary France. At the head of this coalition was Francis of Austri a, who was shortly to be elected emperor, and who had been the first to ally himself with Prussia against Fran ce. Landgrave William attached particular importance to his relations with the man who was shortly to be em peror, and in a letter 17 to the \"Most Excellent, Most Puissant King and highly honored cousin\" he hastened to prom ise his military help as a proof of his \"most special d evotion to your high wishes.\" Francis of Austria expressed his gratitude and observed that this should serve as an exam- ple to others, especially as \"not only every territ orial prince and government of whatever kind they may be, but also every private person possessed of any prop erty, or who has been blessed by God with any possessions or rights acquired by inheritance or otherwise must re alize with ever growing conviction . . . that the war is a uni- versal war declared upon all states, all forms of g overn- ment, and even upon all forms of private property, and any orderly regulation of human society, as is clea rly proved by the chaotic condition and internal desola tion of France and her raging determination to spread si milar conditions throughout the world.\" 18 "},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"The Origins of the Rothschilds 21 But the union of princes had much underrated the offensive of revolutionary France. Under the handic ap of bad leadership and lack of unity the Allies were unable to prevail against the revolutionary armies, inspir ed by the ideals of liberty and nationalism. Prussia and Hesse were forced to retire; and the French General de Cu stine actually succeeded in crossing the Rhine in 1792 an d reaching Frankfort, with the result that William re tired in a panic to Cassel, greatly concerned about his c rown treasures. With rage and indignation he read the Fr ench manifesto to the Hessian soldiers which urged them to forsake the \"tyrant and tiger who sold their blood in order to fill his chest.\" The landgrave finally suc ceeded in driving the small French force out of Frankfort. This cost him a considerable sum of money but his loss w as made good by a new subsidy contract under which he delivered 8,000 Hessian soldiers to England, which had j o i n e d the Coalition against France. Meyer Amschel Rothschild and his rivals were kept fully occupied in dis- counting the bills received from England in connect ion with this transaction. When, in 1795, Prussia withdrew from the war agains t the French Republic, the Landgrave of Hesse followe d her example.

In spite, however, of the secession of Prussia and Hesse, Eng land and Austria continued to carry on the war of the co alition with varying success.

The Rothschild house, which was one of the best-con - structed buildings in the street, suffered only sli ght damage. In view of the time required to rebuild the se houses a departure had to be made from the ghetto p re- cinct, and the Jews had to be allowed to reside and trade outside the strictly defined boundary. The Rothschi lds were among those who took advantage of this favorab le opportunity, and transferred their merchandise busi ness —they were dealing increasingly in war requirements such as cloth, foodstuffs, and wine—to the Schnur G asse which lay near the center of the town, renting acco mmo- dation at a leather dealer's. The military developments of the first coalition wa r, in which Meyer Amschel's princely customer at Cassel w as actively engaged with varying fortunes, entailed co n- siderably increased activity on the part of the var ious crown agents in the landgrave's service. Although t he war had caused not a little damage to Frankfort 19 it had brought the town certain indirect advantages. T he Frankfort Bourse benefited by the decline of the Am ster- dam Bourse, which had hitherto held a dominating po - sition, and which almost completely collapsed when the French conquered Holland in 1795. The result was that much more business came the way of the Frankfo rt bankers, and Meyer Amschel Rothschild's financial a nd trading business, which was closely associated with war requirements, increased by leaps and bounds. The war profits realized at that time formed the re al foundation of the enormous fortune that was later b uilt up by the House of Rothschild. It was of course im- possible any longer completely to conceal such larg e profits. Until 1794 the family property had for twe nty years been assessed at the constant figure of only 2,000 gulden, and they had paid taxes in accordance with this"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"The Origins of the Rothschilds 23 \"assessment,\" amounting to about thirteen gulden an nu- ally. Suddenly in the year 1795 this amount was dou bled, and in the year after that Rothschild was included amongst those whose property was worth 15,000 gulde n or more, that being the highest figure adopted for assess- ment purposes. Meanwhile the three eldest sons had grown up, and after the age of twenty were associated with their father in the business to an increasing extent. Like th eir two eldest sisters they were placed in responsible posi tions and rendered active assistance to their father. A large family, which to so many people is a cause of worry and anxiety, was in this case a positive blessing as th ere was abundance of work for everybody. It made it unnec es- sary for Meyer Amschel to take strangers into his b usi- ness and let them into the various secret and subtl e moves of the game. Since the number of available child ren increased in proportion as the business expanded, i t was possible to keep all the confidential positions in the family. The strong traditional community and family sense of the Jews, reenforced by persecution from o ut- side, compelling them to unite in their own defense , did wonders. The two eldest sons had been zealously eng aged in the business from boyhood, and their father wise ly en- couraged them by letting them share personally in t he business, apart from the general family interest in its prosperity. When the eldest daughter married, in 1795, the son- in-law Moses Worms was not employed in the business , but when the eldest son Amschel Meyer married in 17 96, the daughte r - i n- l aw Eva Hanau was given a post. In spite of the growing number of available members of the family, Meyer Amschel found it necessary als o to engage bookkeepers with a knowledge of languages , as the Rothschild family at that time were all quit e un- educated, speaking and writing only a bad kin d of Frankfort Yiddish German, apart from Hebrew; and"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"24 The Rise of the House of Rothschild in view of their expanding connections with persons in the highest circles they had to pay particular atte ntion to matters of epistolary style. As the only person he could find capable of carrying out this work, was a Chris tian girl, Rothschild did not hesitate to take her into the busi- ness. It was at this period that Meyer Amschel entered in to a highly elaborate deed of partnership with his two eldest sons, which provided that profits and losses should be divided between the three partners according to a definite scheme. The growing demands upon the treasury arising out of the war served to develop the relations with the Land- grave of Hesse. After the separate Peace of Basel William of Hesse adopted the attitude of an imparti al observer of the warlike activities in Europe, and o ccu- pied himself principally in the profitable administ ration of his extensive possessions. He was no stranger to the authentic delights of avarice. Great though his wea lth was, his appetite for increasing it remained keen. He showed the greatest ingenuity in effecting savings of every kind, and spent all his spare time thinking o ut schemes for the profitable investment of the large cash resources which were accumulating in his treasury. The ruling landgrave gradually became a banker to the whole world, advancing his money not only to pr inces and nobles, but also to small shopkeepers and Jews, and even to artizans, where he could get good interest. The amounts lent ranged from hundreds of thousands to a few thalers, according to the financial repute of h is cus- tomers. Cobblers and tailors paid the same rate of interest for small advances as princes for heavy on es. The debts were all accurately registered in account books, making up an enormous number of volumes.

The withdrawal in 1795 of Prussia and Hesse from the war against France had resulted in the tempora ry estrangement of the Austrian Emperor Francis; but h e and the landgrave soon reestablished cordial relati ons, for each of them had need of the other. William d esired support in the acquisition of territory, and in his efforts to attain the dignity of elector, while the emperor was sadly in lack of funds owing to the long war with F rance. The landgrave therefore asked the emperor's support in his aims; the emperor wrote on September 8, 1797, 20 to say that he appreciated the efforts which his cousi n was making on his behalf, and was grateful to learn tha t the landgrave was sympathetic to his need for a loan. \"I also believe,\" he wrote, \"as it is my duty to do, i n your sentiments of loyalty to me and to my house, of whi ch I have received special proof in the matter of the loan that is being negotiated by Herr Kornrumpf. I fl atter myself that your Highness will carry this through t o my complete satisfaction. Your Highness may rest ass ured that for my part I sincerely wish to be of service to you also.\" The details of such transactions were generally neg o- tiated by Jewish agents, and although Meyer Amschel was not employed on this occasion, he was soon to s erve as the middleman between the landgrave and the em- peror. This was made possible by the fact that Rothschild' s wealth had increased rapidly during the last years of the war. Towards the end of the eighteenth centur y it cannot have been far short of a million gulden. The transfer of bills of exchange, cash payments, and t he consignments of merchandise from England, the prin- cipal supply of the Frankfurter Platz, which in its turn, supplied the whole of Germany, made it necessary to appoint a representative on the other side of the C han-"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"26 The Rise of the House of Rothschild nel. As it was essential that any such representati ve should be a trustworthy person, the obvious thing w as to appoint one of the live sons. The two eldest, Amschel 21 and Solomon, who, in 1798, were twenty-five and twenty-four years old respecti vely, were thoroughly initiated into the Frankfort busine ss. The third son, Nathan, a highly gifted young man of twenty-one, intensely industrious and with a very i nde- pendent spirit, felt that his elder brothers did no t give him sufficient scope. In spite of his youth, he too bene- fited by the wise arrangements of his father, and h ad his own personal share in the business and in the famil y property. As the continental states, owing to war and revolut ion, produced much less, but consumed a great deal more than in normal times, English commercial travelers swarmed over the Continent of Europe and in 1798, o ne of them called at the Rothschilds' house of busines s, and was received by Nathan. English commercial trav- elers of that period were exceedingly conscious of the commercial and political supremacy of their country , and they were wont to adopt an arrogant manner, as they felt that the Continent was dependent upon their go ods. The Englishman's manner annoyed Nathan Rothschild; and he met his arrogance with brusqueness, whereupo n the foreigner took his departure. This incident was the immediate cause that decided Nathan to propose to his father that he should go t o England himself, in order to become a merchant ther e on his own account and also to represent the firm o f Rothschild generally. His father and brothers did n ot show any opposition to the enterprising young man a nd supported his decision in every way.

Their confidence was to be justified, for Nathan wa s destined to become the outstanding figure in the Ro ths- childd business. This first branch establishment of the House of Rothschild resulted from the family relationships a nd the requirements of the trade with England, withou t any preconceived plan, and without the remotest ide a of the importance of this step for the future of th e business.

The Peace of Luneville, con- cluded in 1801, had set the seal on the brilliant B ona- parte's territorial victories, thereby giving Franc e the leadership on land, while, however, England's preem i- nence at sea was confirmed. Although Bonaparte had overcome all his other enemies, he was bound to adm it that sea-girt England had maintained its position. The Treaty of Amiens, which followed upon that of Lune- ville, merely marked a transition stage, and was bo und to lead to a resumption of the struggle, until one of the two great opponents should lie bleeding on the grou nd.

The result wa s that innumerable substantial firms, banks, and priv ate persons lost their property, while on the other han d per- sons possessing industry, energy, and resource, wit h a flair for turning opportunity to account, were enabled to gain riches and power. At any rate within their own caste, the Rothschild fam- ily had at that time achieved a position in which t heir future was bound to be profoundly affected by polit ical developments.

The Rothschilds, on t he other hand, had the advantage of a chief who was in dus- trious, energetic, and reliable, and a man of intel ligence. He had to help him four hard-working sons who were developing into first-rate business men under the g uid- ance of their father. One of these, Solomon, had just married Caroline Stern, herself the prosperous daug hter of a Frankfort tradesman, and had thus been enabled to found a home of his own. The third son Nathan was liv- ing in the camp of Napoleon's great enemy England. In hat country with its sea-power and its world-wid e commerce, his undertakings were far better protecte d against Napoleonic interference than those of his f ather and brothers on the Continent. He was able to for m a much more dispassionate judgment of the great event s which followed so rapidly upon one another during t hose years, and was in a better position to turn them to account, Moreover, Nathan was the most enterprising of the f ive sons, of which fact his decision to go to England w as it- self an indication. The commercial activities of the House of Rothschil d in Frankfort itself were not limited to one branch of busi- ness. It took any chance of earning a profit, wheth er as commission or forwarding agents, or in the trade of wine and textiles, which had recently been declared free , and in silk and muslin, not to mention coins and antiqu ities. The wine business in particular expanded greatly; a nd Meyer Amschel did not fail to use every opportunity for extending his connections with princes and potenta tes even beyond the sphere of the Duke of Hesse. One of the most important connections established a t Frankfort was that with the princely House of Thurn and Taxis, the head of which, Prince Karl Anselm, h eld the important position of hereditary postmaster in the Holy Roman Empire."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"30 The Rise of the House of Rothschild This family was of Milanese extraction; in Italy it was known as della Torre, in France as de la Tour. It h ad invented the idea of a post, and had introduced a p ostal system in the Tyrol, toward the end of the fifteent h cen- tury. In 1516 it was commissioned by the Emperor Ma x- imilian I to inaugurate a mounted postal service be tween Vienna and Brussels. Even at that early date the di gni- fied rank of postmaster general was conferred upon one of its members. That was the starting point of the impressive devel op- ment of the Thurn and Taxis postal system, which ca me to embrace the whole of Central Europe. The head of - fices of the system were at Frankfort, but the fami ly were not satisfied with the normal development of their under- taking. They turned the information obtainable from the letters entrusted to their charge to profit. The end of the eighteenth and the beginning of the nineteenth centuries saw the development of the pra ctice of opening letters, noting the contents and then se nding them on to their destinations. In order to retain t he postal monopoly, the House of Thurn and Taxis offer ed to place the emperor in possession of the informati on derived from the so-called secret manipulation of l etters. If, therefore, one were on good terms with the Hous e one could easily and swiftly obtain news, and also disp atch it. In the course of time Meyer Amschel had come to realize that it is of the greatest importance to th e banker and merchant to have early and accurate information of important events, especially in time of war. As his native town was the headquarters of the postal and informa tion service, he had had the foresight to get into touch with the House of Thurn and Taxis, and had transacted va ri- ous financial matters to their great satisfaction. It was on this fact that he relied when he appealed to the foun- tainhead of the Imperial Postal Service at Frankfor t, his Imperial Majesty himself. In a petition to his Majesty that he and his sons s hould"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"The Napoleonic Era 31 be granted the title of crown agent, Meyer Amschel brought forward precisely those matters from which he had derived the greatest profit, namely, his financ ial and commercial transactions in the war against France, and the services which he had rendered to the House of Thurn and Taxis. He had been honest and punctual in his busi- ness dealings, as those witnesses would testify who in- dorsed his petition. The Roman-German Emperor, whose power at this time was practically limited to the granting of hon ors, did actually consent to grant Meyer Amschel the tit le of imperial crown agent by a patent dated January 29, 1800. Not only was this a passport to him throughout the whole of the Roman Empire in Germany; it also carried the right to bear arms, and liberated him from several of the taxes and obligations laid upon the Jews of that pe riod, The patent and the title were signed and granted by Francis II, simply as Roman-German Emperor, and had nothing to do with Austria or Austrian Government d e- partments. It was not until much later that the b rothers Rothschild entered into actual relations with Austr ia and her statesmen. Even as late as 1795, when the Lan dgrave of Hesse lent the Emperor Francis a million gulden, and in 1798 when he lent him an additional half-million , other bankers conducted the transaction, the Rothsc hilds having nothing whatever to do with it. The dispensations enumerated in the imperial patent were more or less paper ones, since most of the sma ller or greater territorial princes, of whom there was s uch a plenitude in Germany in 1800, applied their own law s and regulations.

In 1804 Roths- child requested the Prince of Thurn and Taxis to be stow a similar favor upon one of his sons, in view of th e fact that he himself bore the title of imperial crown ag ent. It was characteristic that when asking the emperor for a title he should mention the services rendered to the House of Taxis, and that when he applied for a favo r to that house he should have based his claim on the fa ct that his services had been recognized by the empero r. Such promotions were necessarily of service to him, too, in his relations with his old patron the Landgrave of Hesse, who in spite of everything was still incline d to be suspicious. William of Hesse was in every way a most important person to Meyer Amschel, for he was colossally rich , richer than the emperor himself, and—a much more im - portant point in those days than now—he was close a t hand. Moreover, he had family ties with England., where Nathan was living, and with chronically penur ious Denmark, by lending money to which the firm of Riip - pell and Harnier, as well as that of Bethmann, had made great profits. Meyer Amschel advised the landgrave to participate in this loan by buying stock. He did purchase a sma ll amount, Rothschild being commissioned to carry thro ugh the transaction. This was done to the landgrave's s atis- faction; but Meyer Amschel required a considerable sum of ready money in order to take advantage of a favo rable opportunity for purchasing goods and bills of excha nge. Knowing that the landgrave, whose investments in En g- land as well as in Germany brought in very good ret urns, had spare cash available, he asked, and obtained fr om him on two occasions—in November, 1801, and July, 1802—160,000 thalers and 200,000 gulden as a guaran - teed loan, the securities being Danish and Frankfor t de- bentures.

The transaction certainly mark ed a distinct advance in Rothschild's confidential relations with the landgrave. The second amount was wanted, not merely for Meyer Amschel himself, but also to assist his two eldest sons, who were already beginning to acquire the titles of court appointments wherever they could. As early as 180 1 they were appointed official agents for making war payme nts on behalf of the State of Hesse. Meyer Amschel had been enviously observing Ruppell and Harnier's financial transactions with Denmark. It was his ambition to do similar business with Denmar k, with landgraviate moneys, on his own account, indep end- ently of any other firm. He still lacked any larg e capital sum, such as others had available, but he was accur ately informed by Buderus of the large amount of ready mo ney in the possession of the ruler of Hesse, which was seeking investment.

They did actually succee d in securing William of Hesse's consent to granting suc h a loan; and no sooner were the conditions agreed than Lawaetz showed his hand to the extent of making the interest payable to Meyer Amschel Rothschild at Fra nk- fort. \"The lender,\" the Hamburg banker wrote to Denmark, \"is an exceedingly rich capitalist, and exceptional ly friendly to the Danish Court.

The profit realized from this transact ion served to key up still further the hatred and enmit y of the rival firms and of Lennep, and led to awkward d e- velopments. Rothschild had shown the greatest energy in these u n- dertakings. He did not even spare himself the journ ey to Hamburg, an exceedingly difficult one at that ti me, in order to get into personal touch with the banker, L awaetz, and to see that the Danish business was carried on as ener- getically as possible.

The sums invested in England called for parti cu- lar attention. Since the Peace of Basel, relations between Hesse and England had been rather strained, althoug h they were not likely to become critical, as the lan dgrave had cleverly succeeded in enlisting the interests o f respon- sible people on his side. He had lent the Prince of Wales, afterwards King George IV, about £200,000 in two instalments. The dukes of York and Clarence wer e guarantors of this loan, but they also borrowed mon ey from the landgrave. In addition to this, William of Hesse had put out £640,000 at interest in London in va- rious ways, a fact which was to prove exceedingly u seful to him. The example of their patron was a lesson to the Hou se of Rothschild, and they soon learned to copy his wi se practice of lending money by preference to persons in the highest position. Even though William of Hesse re- mained neutral in the second War of the Coalition, he secretly wished success to the enemies of Prance fo r he eagerly hoped for the resumption of his profitable sub- sidy contracts with England. The Peace of Luneville, which extended France's boundaries to the Rhine, also conferred on William the dignity of elector, which he had so much desired, a nd which was duly proclaimed in 1803; but the meteoric rise of Bonaparte and revolutionary France's positi on in the world seemed to him to be unnatural and menacin g. His friendship with Prussia was rather shattered, b ecause that state had succeeded in annexing considerable t erri- tory, but had left the Hessian prince in the cold.

His fear of offending England caused him to re- fuse this offer, and thus the elector first gave of fense to the Corsican. Ge had no true idea at the time how dangerous the Cors i c a n might be. The quiet times for Frankfort and Hesse were now at an end. Stirred up by Napoleon 's powerful genius Europe passed from one crisis to an - other, and in such circumstances it was exceedingly dif- ficult for William of Hesse to administer his enorm ous property with foresight and wisdom. He felt the need more and more of Meyer Amschel's advice, so that Ro ths- child's journeys to Cassel became more and more fre - quent. His eldest son had for some months been resi d- ing permanently in that town. The preference shown to the Frankfort family arouse d the envy and hatred of the Cassel Jews against this out- sider. They complained that not merely did he steal their best business, but he was not even subject to the n ight- rate and poll-tax which other Jews had to pay. Me yer Amschel did his utmost to evade such payments as fa r as possible, but in the end he was forced to pay so me of these taxes. In August, 1803, he found it necessary to apply to the elector for a letter of protection in Cassel for hi mself and his sons, so that, although resident in Frankfort, he should enjoy the same rights as the protected Jews of Cass el. This would certainly entail obligations as well. His re- quest was granted on payment of 400 reichsthaler, b ut the document was not completed, possibly in accordance with Meyer Amschel's own wishes, for he would then have been liable to pay taxes in Cassel also. The Cassel Jews, however, soon got wind of thi s maneuver, and in the end Meyer Amschel was required to state in whose name he wished the letter of protect ion made out, whereupon he wrote the following letter t o the elector: 4 "},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"38 The Rise of the House of Rothschild Most gracious Elector, most excellent Prince and Lord!

This was made manifest in various ways. When shops were put up to auction in the electoral courtyard, to which Jews, even resident J ews, were not admitted, an exception was made in favor o f Meyer Amschel. One of the shops was definitely ex- cluded from the auction and reserved for Rothschild . It is possible that ready money was a factor, as well as his prestige in this matter. This period saw the conclusion of the two last, and by far the most substantial Danish loans, of 700,000 a nd 600,000 thalers. In these transactions too, Lawaetz played a part of some importance. In spite of ve ry friendly business relations, he was still somewhat reserved in his attitude toward the Rothschild family. Whils t in talking to his friends he often declared that he ha d found 5 \"Herr Rothschild always to be exceedingly prompt an d businesslike and worthy of the most complete co nfi- dence,\" yet he felt that where such large amounts w ere at stake, one ought to be very cautious, even in de aling with Rothschild. The atmosphere then was full of sus- picion, all the more so because the political barom eter in Europe pointed to stormy times, and the capitali sts were exceedingly uneasy as to the possible fate of their wealth. Bonaparte had already cast aside his mask and was boldly grasping at the imperial purple; toward the end of the summer of 1804 the whole of France was echoi ng with the shout \"Vive l'Empereur!\" The prestige of the German imperial system was suffering a correspondin g decline, an obvious symptom of which was the procla ma- tion on August 10, 1804, of Francis II as Emperor o f Austria.

The elector pleaded a sudden attack, of gout. Napoleon replied coldly; he was still polite, but he swore that William should pay for having failed immediately to adhere to the confeder ation which was being formed under Napoleon's protection. The French ambassador at Cassel had uttered the men ac- ing words, when he heard that the prince was not go ing to Mainz, \"On n'oublie pas, on n'oublie rien!\" 6 The Elector of Hesse was left feeling rather uncom- fortable, and he secretly threw out cautious feeler s toward England and Austria—Austria was already showing a marked inclination to side against France. The occa sion of the Emperor Francis' assuming the imperial title con- nected with his Austrian hereditary territories, af forded him an opportunity of expressing his most sincere a nd devoted good wishes to the \"most excellent, puissan t, and invincible Roman Emperor and most gracious Lord 7 for the continuous welfare of the sacred person of his Imperial Majesty and for the ever-increasing glory of the all-highest Imperial House.\" His pen was jogged by the need he felt for powerful support, and incidentally the letter was to serve t he pur- pose of reminding the emperor of a request which th e writer had made on November 22, 1804, and which so far had not been granted.

In May, 1805, Austria finally joined the coali tion against Napoleon. Napoleon gave up his idea of la nding in the British Isles, and concentrated on Austria. This resulted in great shortage of money, for the Austri an Treasury had heavy burdens to bear from former wars ; coin was scarce and paper money much depreciated. It was herefore decided that the interest on loans sho uld not, as had hitherto been the practice, be payable in hard cash in all the principal exchanges in Europe, but should be payable in paper in Vienna only. This was har d for the elector personally, as he had advanced a mi llion and a half gulden to the Emperor Francis; and he at once begged that an exception might be made in h is favor since \"ill-disposed persons had suggested to him that the Austrian state was going to go bankrupt, as far as all external debts were concerned.\" 8 The imperial ambassador Baron von Wessenberg, nat- urally wishing to turn the general situation to acc ount, sent this request forward under cover of a private dis- patch of his own in which he wrote: \"Since avarice is the elector's great weakness, it might be possible, should you wish to do so, to obtain a still greater loan from him if you agreed that interest i n future should be payable in cash.

During the war, England sent financial assistance t o Austria in the shape of a monthly payment of a thir d of a million pounds in cash, which was sent to Aust ria by the most difficult and circuitous routes. The Ro ths- child method of transferring large sums of money wa s as yet unknown, and the only method in use was the dan - gerous one of sending actual bullion by road. A con sign- ment of money was actually on the way when Austerli tz was being fought, and, in fear of a defeat, orders were issued from imperial headquarters instructing this con- signment to be diverted in a wide circuit through G alicia and the Carpathians. The war complications in which Europe was involved forced almost all states, whether they wished to or not, to take sides. The Elector of Hesse characteristica lly wished to attach himself to that party out of which he could make the greatest profit. As Prussia was now also being drawn into conflict with Napoleon, she a t- tempted to draw the elector in on her side. On the other hand, the French Court gave him to understand that sub- stantial advantages would be gained by the electora te if he kept himself completely free from Prussian influ ence.

As a counterblast to this, Prussia attempted to bri ng ahout a union of the princes of Northern Germany, a nd to gain the support of the Elector of Hesse by offe ring him the prospect of an accession of territory and t he dig- nity of kingship which he so much desired. These moves were followed by threats and promises on the side o f France. The attitude of the elector remained unde fined. He now thought it best to preserve the appearance o f neutrality until the actual outbreak of war, and th en simply to join the side which was winning, although a signed, if not ratified, treaty with Prussia was in ex- istence. He had, however, not reckoned sufficiently with the forceful personality of Napoleon. It was impossib le to conduct a nebulous diplomacy with such a man.

Business had just been going so exceedin gly well. The firm of Bethmann, which had felt that it was being driven into the background, and had just been making strenuous efforts to get a share in the elec tor's loan business with Denmark, was forced to withdraw from the contest, on account of the political condi tions and the resulting shortage of money, and thereby le ft the way open to Rothschild, who still had resources ava ilable. In the meantime Lawaetz in Hamburg had definitely decided in Rothschild's favor. On July 2, 1806, he wrote himself to Buderus 11 to say that he would s t a n d by their good friend Rothschild as far as he could, saying: \"I hope that in the end people will realize that he is a good fellow who deserves to be respected; the envious ma y say what they like against him.\" In spite of all that Rothschild had hitherto done i n the service of the elector, he had not won his conf idence to the extent of being called in in a matter which had become pressing on account of the developing milita ry situation; for although the elector continued to ho pe that the notices naively posted on the roads leading to Hesse, bearing the words \"Pays Neutre\" would be respected, he was sufficiently concerned for the safety of his tr easures to send away and conceal his more valuable possessi ons.

There being no distinction between the treasury and"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"The Napoleonic Era 45 the prince's private purse, it was necessary to get out of the way, not only his own valuables, but also the c abinet, war and chancery cash records, for a period coverin g several decades; for so the books of his financial admin- istration were called, in order to make it impossib le to examine into the state of his affairs. There were l arge volumes of these records, representing vast sums; i n the war chest alone there was over twenty-one million t halers, sixteen millions of which were out on loan in vario us places, and bringing in interest to the tune of man y thou- sands of thalers. All this had to be concealed as f ar as possible, and this business was done by trusty offi cials, under the guidance of Buderus. But there is nothing to show that any of the Rothschilds were employed in t he long-continued work of transport and concealment. Time was pressing; some of the things were sent to Denmark; but it was impossible to get everything ou t of the country, and to have done so would have attract ed too much attention. So the elector, who gave the closest personal attention to the plans for insuring the sa fety of his possessions, decided that the most precious art icles should be buried within the walls of three of his c astles. Under the stairs of the castle of Wilhelmshohe were hidden twenty-four chests, containing silver and mo rt- gage documents to the value of one and a half milli on gulden, amongst which were certain Rothschild deben - tures, while twenty-four chests with cash vouchers and certain valuable volumes from the library were conc ealed in the walls under the roof. A similar number of chests were concealed in the picturesque castle of Lowenbu rg, built in the Wilhelmshohe park, while further treas ures were conveyed in forty-seven chests to the Sababurg , sit- uated in a remote forest.

The elector gazed anxiously fro m the windows of his castle at the enemy's camp-fires , and sent adjutant after adjutant to Mortier, the French mar- shal. In due course the French envoy was announced, and brought an ultimatum from Napoleon, significant ly addressed: \"To the Elector of Hesse-Cassel, Field- Marshal in the service of Prussia.\" In short, biting sentences William's double game wa s exposed, and the occupation of the country and the dis- armament of its inhabitants was proclaimed. The ele ctor immediately decided to throw in his lot with Napole on and to join the Confederation of the Rhine. But it was too late; Marshal Mortier would no longer listen to the elector's messengers. The elector realized that the re was nothing for him but flight. In the few hours before the French entered the coun try he would have to move as many of his remaining poss es- sions as he could, and make the more urgent disposi tions regarding outstanding accounts. William gave Buderu s power of attorney to receive the interest payments due from the Emperor Francis in Vienna; and Buderus tra ns- ferred this power of attorney to Rothschild, who pr o- ceeded to collect these payments for the elector, t hrough a business friend in Vienna, the banker Frank. Besides this, Buderus that night brought two chests con- taining securities and statements of accounts to th e house of the Austrian ambassador at Cassel, Baron von Wes sen- berg, and begged him to take charge of them.

In his heart Meyer Amschel remained loyal to the elector, and saw that the position arising out of t he French invasion and the flight of the elector was o ne in which he could still be of great service to him. He pre- sumably came quite rightly to the conclusion, that it was in the elector's own interest that he should stay a way at this critical period, so that he might, if possible , carry on the elector's business behind the backs of the Fren ch. In following his natural inclinations, and not comprom ising himself in the eyes of the French, and in keeping o ut of the way of these dangerous companions as far as pos sible, he was also following the course of the greatest pr actical utility.

Four of these chests, containing papers of the Privy Council, found their way to Meyer A mschel Rothschild's house with the green shield in the Jew ish quarter, during the Spring Fair of 1807. This was the only part played by the House of Rothschild in the actual saving of the electoral treasures. Meyer Amschel Rothschild hid these chests, having left one of them for a time with his son-in-law Mos es Worms, in the cellar of his house. In case of eme rgency he could have recourse to a separate cellar behind the house and under the courtyard, the approach to this cellar from the house cellar being very easy to con ceal. The courtyard cellar, too, was connected by a secre t pas- sage with the neighboring house. The persecution of the Frankfort Jews in earlier times, had led to man y such s e c r e t r e f u g e s being constructed. In this case i t was therefore reasonable to assume that if the house we re searched by foreigners like the French, the cellar under the courtyard would not be discovered at all, and t hat even if it were discovered there was a good chance of getting its contents into the next house. In the meantime political changes had occurred whic h put and end to the political independence of Frankf ort. Karl von Dalberg, who had collaborated with Talley- rand in the creation of the Confederation of the Rh ine, was nominated Primate of the Confederation on June 12, 1806, and by a decree of Napoleon was granted t he city of Frankfort and the surrounding territory as his residence. This was a fact of much importance, both to the ele ctor and to his devoted servants the Rothschild family, for Dalberg was particularly well-disposed to the elect or and to his administrator Buderus, on account of his busi- ness dealings with them in earlier times; and, alth ough he was an archbishop and a strict Catholic, he was known to be tolerant in his religious views. The incorp oration of Frankfort in the Confederation of the Rhine put an"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"52 The Rise of the House of Rothschild end to its constitution as a state of the empire; a nd the Jews, who had hitherto been subjected to oppression by the hostile patrician families who had controlled t he senate, now hoped for the abolition of all those re stric- tions, prohibitions and special laws under which th ey had suffered for centuries. Under the new regime life in the great commercial city took on an entirely different complexion. It h ad to be ordered in accordance with the wishes, or rather the commands, of the French. This was especially the ca se when Napoleon, in order to deal a deadly blow at th e arch enemy England, declared the continental blocka de whereby all commerce and communication by letter or otherwise with England was prohibited. As that coun - try was practically the only emporium for such indi s- pensable colonial produce as coffee, sugar, and tob acco. the prices of these articles rose enormously, and a clever merchant could make large profits through timely pu r- chases or by smuggling goods through Holland and th e harbors of North Germany. In spite of the control exercised by France over th e trade of Frankfort, Meyer Amschel and his son con- trived, with the assistance of Nathan in England, t o make a good deal of money in this way. There were certai nly risks attached to this form of commerce, for under Article 5 of the continental blockade, all goods of English ori- gin were declared lawful prize. With the passage of time this kind of business became more restricted, for as Napoleon's power increased he was able to make the con- trol more effective. Meyer Amschel well knew that in spite of his flight and the loss of property which he had suffered at t he hands of the French, the elector was still in posse ssion of very considerable resources. There was, moreover , always the possibility of a sudden change in Napole on's fantastic career, and such an event would immediate ly alter the whole situation. He therefore adhered to his"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"The Napoleonic Era 53 policy of ingratiating himself to the best of his a bility with Napoleon's nominee, the new lord of Frankfort, whil he continued faithfully to serve the elector i n secret. For his purpose it was necessary that he should rem ain in constant communication with him. On the 15th of December, 1806, Meyer Amschel sent an account 17 to Schleswig of his earlier sales of London bills of exchange, and reported that the other bill s which he held were unsalable at the moment. Although t he \"servile script\" was full of protestations of grove ling humility, and was composed in the illiterate style and full of the spelling mistakes of the old Meyer Amsc hel, it revealed a certain pride, for Father Rothschild made considerable play with the good relations which he had established with Dalberg. Rothschild reported with pride that he had influenc ed Dalberg in favor of the elector, and had induced th e new lord of Frankfort to intercede with the Emperor and Empress of France on the elector's behalf. He beg ged to state, however, that Dalberg advised that the el ector should not stand so much upon his rights, but shoul d adopt towards Napoleon the attitude of a \"humble pe ti- tioner.\" Meyer Amschel concluded by assuring t he elector of his unswerving loyalty and devotion, and de- clared that he hoped, through his influence with Da l- berg, substantially to reduce the war contribution of one million, three hundred thousand thalers imposed by Na- poleon upon the elector personally. He also asse rted that Dalberg had commended him to all the French ma r- shals and ministers. Although this letter of Meyer Amschel's was written in a boastful vein, and although he exaggerated his in- fluence, as in point of fact he did not succeed in getting the levy reduced (incidentally, the elector got the levy transferred to the estates of the realm of Hesse), yet the report contained an element of truth.

There appear to have been financial reason s for this relationship, and it no doubt originated i n loans granted by Rothschild. When the elector had come to feel reasonably secure in his new place of refuge in Schleswig, he devoted him- self again to his favorite hobby, and tried to set in order his chaotic possessions. Buderus had control of t his work at every point. He had left Schleswig some time b efore and returned to Hanau, where he was occupied in cal ling in debts due to the elector, before they could accr ue to the French. There was, for instance, the claim on Prince von Zeil-Wurzach, which was in great danger of bein g lost. Buderus, however, succeeded in saving this item, and in his report he referred with emphasis to the as- sistance granted by Rothschild, mentioning his name re- peatedly. \"I owe it entirely to the efforts of the Crown Agen t Rothschild,\" he wrote to his master on March 8, 180 7, \"that I am still not entirely without hope; and he has undertaken to arrange an interview between myself a nd the Wurzach chancellor in a place which he will select.\" 18 The eldest son of the princely debtor attended this con- ference himself, and it resulted in the repayment t o Buderus of the outstanding amount, which Buderus as - scribed to the fact that Rothschild had used his in fluence to such good effect with the advisers and officials of the prince.

In accordance with Napoleon's instructio ns, the French attempted, as they had already done in t he case of Prince von Zeil-Wurzach, to divert the mone ys lent by the elector in his own country to the Frenc h Treas- ury, by offering substantial discounts on the amoun t due. It is true that Lagrange had valued these amounts a t only four million thalers, the equivalent of sixtee n million francs, but actually they amounted to about sixteen mil- lion thalers. One can therefore readily imagine the dis- may which the action of the French occasioned the elector. A large number of princes belonging to the Con- federation of the Rhine, who owed him money, took a d- vantage of the opportunity of settling their debts at a reduction. On Rothschild's advice, the elector impl ored the Emperor Francis at Vienna on no account to pay to the French either the capital sum or the interest d ue in respect of the million and a half gulden which he h ad borrowed from the elector. All the efforts to cause Napoleon to change his att itude failed; and meanwhile the situation at Gottorp had be- come impossible. The elector had arranged for his f a- vorite mistress Schlotheim to join him, and his hos t's wife, who was a sister of the elector's consort, wa s afraid of causing pain to the latter if she associated wit h the Schlotheim. Also the collapse of a rising in Hesse de- prived him of a last hope. \"Fools!\" exclaimed Lagrange in a proclamation to th e Hessians on the 18th of February, 1807. \"Count no longer upon your prince; he and his house have ceas ed to rule.

Rothschild had latterly bee n col- lecting and accounting for the interest on the Engl ish and Danish loans due to the elector. As this had no t been settled by the e l e c t o r personally, he complained of the arrangement. He again became suspicious, and sudden ly required that Buderus should not allow this money t o pass through Rothschild's hands, but that it should be paid direct into the reserve treasury at Itzehoe, a n ar- rangement which was more difficult to carry out. Th is was galling, both for Buderus and for Meyer Amschel Rothschild, who was just endeavoring through Dalber g's good offices to buy back the elector's coin collect ion, con- taining so many gold and silver specimens of pricel ess value, which had been carried off to Paris. The fol low- ing events did not improve the elector's temper. By offering the tsar the prospect of sharing the wo rk dominion with himself, Napoleon had in the Treaty o f Tilsit reaped the fruits of his campaign against Pr ussia. The result was that Hesse was allotted to the newly cre- ated kingdom of Westphalia, and Napoleon's brother Jerome pitched his tent in William's residence at C assel. The exiled elector was filled with rage and indigna tion, and his tendency to behave unjustly to those about him became more marked. When Buderus was again staying with his master at Itzehoe, and spoke of Rothschild and the services that he had rendered, the elector indi cated that he noted the special favor shown to Rothschild with surprise, as after all, he was a Jew of very obscur e ante- cedents, and expressed his concern to find Buderus em- ploying him, as he had lately been doing, to the ex clusion of almost everybody else, in the most important fin ancial transactions.

Buderus pointed out that Bethmann, in view of his standing as a Frankfort patrician, and as the head of a firm that was centuries old, could not so suitably be em- ployed in transactions which in the difficult polit ical con- ditions of the time could not bear the light of day . He added that Bethmann's financial resources had given out in connection with the Danish loan in 1806, and tha t Rothschild far surpassed him in determination and e n- ergy.

Buderus's representations succeeded finally in alla ying this bout of suspicion against the Rothschild famil y, with whom he had now established very close personal rel a- tions.

Up to this time the elector had turned down the various proposals regarding the collection of inter est and the investment of capital that Nathan had made to h im from London. As late as June, 1807, he actuall y in- structcd his charge d'affaires in London to vouchsa fe no reply whatever if Nathan should venture again to in quire as to the elector's financial affairs. 26 In this matter too, he was slowly and completely to change his attitude , without any disadvantage to himself.

There was still Austria. In his last letter 27 the Em- peror Francis had expressed his \"most heartfelt sym pathy in these sad circumstances,\" with the hope that he might be of assistance to him. The elector accordingly asked for asylum in Austrian territory, and decided to co ntinue his flight to Bohemia, stopping first at Carlsbad.

All kinds of Gon- fidential persons and secret agents of the police, some of them disguised under titles of nobility and wearing of- ficers' uniforms, were sent to Prague.

This movement could not as yet come into the open, but in Konigsberg, where the king and the gov- ernment of Prussia were residing, the \"Tugendbund\" was formed, a league which ostensibly pursued moral-sci en- tific aims, but the ultimate object of which was de liver- ance of Germany.

These supposi- tions are based on the following fact: whenever I enter the elector's quarters, I always find Rotschi ld there, and g e n e r a l l y in the company of Army Coun- cilor Schminke and War Secretary Knatz, and they go into their own rooms, and Rotschild generally ha s papers with him.

Owing to his extensive business connections it is probable that he can ascertain this more easily tha n anybody else, and can also conceal his machinations under the cloak of business. This report was more or less in accordance with the facts; for Rothschild was the connecting link betwe en Buderus, who lived in Hesse and could never come to fragile, and the elector. Rothschild was also const antly busy with the elector's financial affairs, and thes e were of a p a r t i c u l a r l y wide scope at the beginning of 1809, since with the passage of time the accumulations of money in England, by way of interest and otherwise, had grow n so large that t h e i r supervision required particular care. Buderus proposed that his master should acquire Bri tish securities at t h r e e per cent, 40 and suggested that Meyer Amschel should he commissioned to effect the purcha se of them. Rothschild had naturally made this proposa l to Buderus in the first instance, and Buderus had d uly put it forward as his own suggestion."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"The Napoleonic Era 69 The close relations between Buderus and Rothschild had at that time actually been embodied in a writte n agreement between them which virtually made the ele c- toral official a secret partner in the firm of Roth schild, This highly important document runs as follows: \"The following confidential agreement has today bee n c o n c l u d e d between the Privy War Councilor Buderus v on Carlshausen, and the business house of Meyer Amsche l R o t s c h i l d at Frankfort: Whereas Buderus has handed over to the banking firm of Meyer Amschel Roths- child the capital sum of 20,000 gulden, 24 florins, and has promised to advise that firm in all business matter s to the best of his ability and to advance its interest s as far as he may find practicable, the firm of Meyer Amschel Rothschild promises to render Buderus a true accoun t of the profits made in respect of the above-mentioned capital sum of 20,000 gulden, and to allow him access to al l books at any time so that he may satisfy himself with reg ard to this provision.\" 41 The agreement contained a provision for its termina - tion on either side by giving six months' notice. Buderus now had a personal interest in securing for Meyer Amschel Rothschild a monopoly in the conduct of the elector's business. What he had done had b een in the best interests of all concerned. His exper ience of a period of years had proved to him the reliability a nd the skill of the House of Rothschild; he harbored no pr eju- dices against the Jews; and he was firmly convinced that the elector, his master, was bound to gain by placi ng his financial affairs in the hands of one firm, especia lly of such an able firm as the House of Rothschild. The Rothschilds on the other hand needed the suppor t of a man who could gain for them the confidence of the suspicious and avaricious elector, who was an excee dingly difficult person to handle.

Finally Buderus himself profited by this arrangemen t as he fully deserved to do after the persevering and s elf- sacrificing efforts that he had made; and he could never hope that he would be regarded in accordance with h is deserts by the rapacious elector. Moreover, he was far too scrupulous and honorable spontaneously to appropria te money in the course of his administration of the el ector's property; but he had a very large family, and by be com- ing a secret partner in the firm of Rothschild he w as enabled to meet its requirements. Buderus's efforts with his master were successful. The elector acted upon Rothschild's recommendations reg ard- ing British stocks, and he then actually ordered th at £150,000 of the stocks should be purchased on his a c- count, which in fact exceeded the amount that Buder us had suggested. The investment itself was entrusted to Rothschild. Up to this time the financial transactions in Engla nd had been the most reliable as far as interest payme nts were concerned; but the payments in respect of inte rest due from members of the English royal house came in at most irregular intervals and were often outstand ing for very long periods. The elector, however, did not ag itate to get these payments in, for he regarded the money laid out in this direction less as an investment than as a means of putting the members of the ruling house under an obligation to himself. The brothers Rothschild noted this practice of the elec- tor with important personages; they had practical e vi- dence, from the experience of their princely client , of the fact that transactions involving temporary loss may ulti- mately result in very good business.

At this time the bond between the House of Rothschi ld and the elector had become a very close one; and th is was not due to Buderus only, but also to their loyalty; al- though this quality resulted to their advantage, th ey in- curred the risks that loyalty involved. The only really unpleasant circumstance in this connection was the fact that the frivolous heir to the elector, who was alw ays in need of money, exploited the situation and at every pos- sible opportunity borrowed from his father's fa ithful Jewish servant. In any case that could not be a very serious matter, as Rothschild was morally certain t o get his money back, the prince being the heir to the en ormous fortune which his father had amassed. These large financial transactions did not put an e nd to the dealings in small antiques between the elect or and Rothschild, which had been the starting-point of th eir business relations. However, there was a differe nce: their roles were reversed; the elector now sold to Roths- child vases, jewels and antique boxes, etc. more of ten than he bought them. These dealings constituted a pecu liar bond of sympathy between the elector and his Jewish crown agent, and the elector enjoyed showing his ta lent in this field, as far as was consistent with his hi gh birth. Meanwhile the relations between Austria and France had become more acute. The Emperor Napoleon had r e- turned from Spain, and a new war between Napoleon and the Emperor Francis was imminent. The electo r offered the emperor a legion of four thousand men, this offer being coupled with a touching appeal that the em- peror should secure his reinstatement in the rulers hip of his territories. 42 The offer was thankfully accepted.

The electo r, however, put only one half of the promised forces i n the field. That cost him 600,000 gulden; and it was Rot hs- child who saw to the collection and distribution of this sum. This work was full of danger for the Rothschilds as they were at the mercy of the French in Frankfort. In spite of the great s c a r c i t y of money at the time it was Rothschild who from his own resources advanced to t he e l e c t o r the cash amount of several hundred thousand gulden required on short loan. The elector already saw himself in possession of his states. \"I come,\" he w rote somewhat prematurely in a proclamation of April, 18 09, \"to loose your bonds; Austria's exalted monarch pro tects me and protects you. Let us hail the brave Austrian s; they are our true friends, and it is in their midst and with their assistance that I come to you.\" It was with eloquence rather than with cash that he called upon his Hessians to rise.

Notwithstanding that Buderus and R o t h s c h i l d were on such exceedingly good terms with the Primate of the Confederation at Frankfort, the fact that King Jerome's position in Westphalia had been seriously threatened caused the police at Cassel to watch the movements of Buderus and Rothschild with renewe d"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"The Napoleonic Era 73 assiduity, as they suspected them, not unjustly, of having financed the rising. This favorable opportunity was exploited by jealous rivals at Cassel, who supplied the police and their noto- rious chief, Savagner, with information. Moreover, Baron Bacher, the accredited Westphalian ambassador to Dalberg at Frankfort, was a bitter enemy of Roth s- child, and felt particular displeasure at the favor shown by Dalberg to the Jew, since he had long been convi nced that Rothschild was in the elector's confidence in all the activi t i e s undertaken against the French. Savagne r, who thought that a prosecution of the rich Jew might ac crue to the benefit of his own pocket, concentrated all his ef- forts on inducing King Jerome of Westphalia to auth or- ize the issue of a warrant against Meyer Amschel Ro ths- child on the ground that he had been a channel thro ugh whom the elector's money had passed to the rebels. In this dangerous situation Rothschild appealed to Dalberg to intervene on his behalf; Dalberg did wha t he could, and it was only with great difficulty tha t the French police in Cassel managed to obtain the warra nt. A Certain Levy, the son-in-law of a rival of Rothsc hild, informed Savagner as to the lines on which Rothschi ld should be examined regarding his business dealings with the elector. On May 9, 1809, Buderus was again arrested at Hanau , submitted to searching cross-examinations, and was let out onsubstantial bail only after an interval of se veral days. On May 10 Savagner set out for Frankfort with the warrant which he had at last succeeded in obtai ning, but which authorized only a domiciliary search and a close examination of all members of the House of Ro ths- child.

He was particular ly concerned about the elector's four chests containin g ac- count books which were under his care; they were in his house cellar, and he did not even know what the y contained. As the cellar would naturally be searche d, he would have to do his host to rescue the elector' s prop- erty as speedily as possible in the general excitem ent arising out of the sudden menace. Old Meyer Amschel and his wife, Solomon and James, and the wives of the two eldest sons were at home. Am- schel, the eldest son, was staying with the elector at Prague, and Carl was traveling on other business. T hose members of the f a m i l y who were at home now tried to get the compromising chests through the connecting passage to the yard cellar at the back, but they fo und that the passage was too narrow for the chests. The se were therefore emptied, and their contents placed i n other cases, together with some coupons representin g un- realized obligations due to the firm itself. The fa mily then set about the work of hiding the compromising account books and the secret records of the elector 's in- timate affairs, as well as certain embarrassing cor re- spondence. When the Westphalian commissioner of police arrived on the 10th of May, 1809, furnished with his exceed - ingly limited warrant for summoning the Rothschild family and searching their house at Frankfort, the most important documents had already been well concealed , and the i n d i v i d u a l members of the family had arrang ed between themselves what they would say when they we re examined, so that they would not get involved in co ntra- dictory statements.

At the same time, for finan cial reasons it was only with reluctance that the King o f West- phalia himself had consented to the issue of the wa rrant. It was therefore a foregone conclusion that the Rot hs- child family would not suffer any serious harm. Dal - berg also gave orders that one of his own police of ficials should accompany Savagner. The two commissioners accordingly betook themselves to Rothschild's busin ess house in the Jewish quarter where the whole family were expecting them. Old Meyer Amschel, who on this occasion too was unwell, was placed under arrest in his own room, wh ile Solomon and James were placed under arrest in the o f- fice below, under the guard of police constables. In the meantime all cupboards containing papers and busine ss correspondence were sealed, and a systematic search of the whole house was instituted. Simultaneous ly the home of Solomon, who also lived in the town, was su b- mitted to a similar search. Thanks to the advance warn- ings and to the well-concealed duplicate books, not much incriminating matter was discovered. The next step was to investigate the individual mem - bers of the family. Meyer Amschel had to answer the questions drafted by the Jew Levy on the instructio ns of his rival, the banker Simon, at Cassel—questions af fect- ing the details of Rothschild's financial dealings with the elector. In many cases he replied that he ha d no recollection of the matters referred to, pointing o ut that he had suffered a severe illness and undergone an o per- ation in 1808; he stated that this had had serious after- effects, and more particularly, that it had affecte d his memory.

The two sons made the statements which th ey had previously arranged with their father, and in g en- eral said as little as possible. The e x a m i n a t i o n of such books as were discovered yielded very slight result, as the incriminating do cu- ments had been removed. Meyer Amschel cleverly used an opportunity which proffered itself, of lending S avag- ner three hundred thalers, and this helped consider ably to expedite the conclusion of the official investig ation. In any case, Savagner's authority was of a limited kind, and Dalberg's commissioner, who was himself a Jew, was well-disposed toward Rothschild, and used his i n- fluence to bring the examination to an end. As suff icient material had been collected to show that the action which had been taken was justified and necessary in the c ircum- stances, the authorities at Cassel, too, were satis fied. For- tunately for the accused, Rothschild's enemy, Ambas sa- dor Bacher, was not in Frankfort at this time; so t hat the whole painful business passed off well for the fam- ily of Rothschild.

The only positive result of the in quiry was to establish the fact that Amschel Rothschild w as staying at Prague and was directing the financial s pecu- lations of the Elector of Hesse; and that the firm of Rothschild had made small payments to individual le ad- ers of the insurrection.

These facts in themselves furnished sufficient mate rial for dealing ruthlessly with the family—if that had been seriously desired; but the Rothschilds benefited by the i n h i b i t i o n s of the rulers of Frankfort and Cassel, who at heart were pleased to have remained faithful to the elector, although they had maintained practical rel ations with the new French powers. Everything had result ed h a p p i l y , and the Rothschilds could breathe freely, but it had been a warning to act with even greater prec aution in the future. The most important thing was to ge t the chests belonging to the elector out of the house at once, for in the course of another search the yard cellar might perhaps be discovered. The chests were therefore sent successively through the mediation of a Jewish frie nd to a business acquaintance of the Rothschilds at Darms tadt - a certain Abraham Mayer—and they stayed with him until the elector returned to his country.

The elector at Prague had been anxiously watching the changing vicissitudes of the campaign.

The boxes had to come back, and the elector set out for Berlin, a s the king had already offered to shelter him there. But the king now rather regretted having made this offer; N a- poleon was too powerful and might resent the electo r's being granted asylum in Berlin. The king therefore wrote on J a n u a r y 29, 1810, to put him off, on the g round of \"managements delicats\" obtaining between himself and Napoleon at the time. Meanwhile peace was signe d at Schonbrunn, no mention whatever of the elector b eing made in the treaty. Napoleon returned to Paris, whe re- upon W i l l i a m decided to remain at Prague. The unsuccessful campaign of 1809 had resulted in the retirement of Count Stadion, the Austrian Minis ter for Foreign Affairs, and this brilliant man and bit ter op- ponent of Napoleon withdrew for some years into pri - vate life. On October 8, 1809, he was succeeded by Prince Clemens Metternich, who was to play such a decisive role in the destinies of Europe during the fol- lowing half-century. Metternich had only just entered upon his duties wh en he received a letter from the Elector of Hesse, req uesting the minister to support him, and \"to restore to his or- phaned subjects their native prince, whose presence they so ardently desired.\" He had great hopes that Mette r- nich would use his influence with the emperor, and he was b i t t e r l y disappointed when he learned that he h ad not even been mentioned during the peace negotiatio ns.

The money motive was always the principal one with the elector, and in this matter he had a perfect unders tand- ing with his crown agent Rothschild. Rothschild a lways advised the elector to ask concessions at every pos sible oppurtunity—as, for instance, that claims on him in re- spect of the troops should be waived, etc.—and the elec- tor got more and more accustomed to following Roths - child's advice, and scarcely took any important fin ancial step without consulting him. A sum of £150,000 had been invested as recently as December 18, 1809, in three per cent British Consol s from interest received on behalf of the \"poor\" elec tor. The business in connection with this transaction na turally entailed voluminous correspondence, for the conveya nce of which between Frankfort and Prague Meyer Amschel made himself personally responsible. He traveled in a private post-chaise which contained a secret drawer . The French were anxious to intercept if possible th e correspondence between the elector and his Frankfor t agents; once they did actually succeed in seizing a letter destined for England which clearly revealed the fa ct that the Rothschilds were responsible for the manag e- ment of the elector's funds in that country. 46 In the meantime an important change had taken place in general European politics.

Nothing could be achieved against Napoleon by the u se of force, and therefore Metternich tried other mean s. Napoleon's marriage with Josephine was childless. His union with an imperial princess would increase his prestige and might produce the heir he so much de- sired. The hitherto hostile states were thus reconc iled by the prospect of a marriage, and in January, 1810 , the imperial house of Austria gave Napoleon to understa nd that if he asked for the hand of Marie Louise, the eigh- teen-year-old daughter of the emperor, he would not be refused. The contract of marriage was signed as ear ly as the 7th of February. One of the first to be informed of this complete ch ange in the situation was the Elector of Hesse. He immed i- ately wrote again to Metternich to the following ef fect: \"I am writing to your Excellency trusting to enlist your sympathy for my most cherished desires. The marriag e which is to unite the two greatest monarchies cause s me to hope that I may regain the Emperor Napoleon's go od- will, if our emperor . . . will but intercede in my favor.

The minister had great difficulty in dissua ding him from traveling to Vienna.

The financial affairs of the court and of the public departments were getting steadily worse, and the new friendship with France had done but little to l ighten the burdens of debt incurred under the recent peace treaty. In the negotiations between France and Au stria the Austrian Treasury official Nikolaus Barbier had been so vehement in his advocacy of Austria's interests that the French plenipotentiary on one occasion actually pro- tested against his being present. This clever fi nancial expert had played a considerable part in all the va rious loan operations which Austria had had to carry out dur- ing these wars. At that time the imperial state had no business rel a- tions with the Rothschild banking firm. There wer e four more or less official discount houses at Vienna, th rough which the Austrian government arranged its loans an d other monetary business. They were the banking fi rms, Geymuller and Company, Arnstein and Eskeles and Company, Graf Fries and Company, and Steiner and Company. The Austrian government also dealt with the banking firm of Parish at Hamburg in 1809, in m at- ters relating to remittances and realizations—such were the technical terms used at the time—of English sub sidy moneys. The condition of the Austrian state finances was la m- entable.

The banker Eskeles made a journey to Paris and Hol- land in order to r a i s e this money. It was also suggested that the state lottery monopo ly should he mortgaged, hut the four banking firms had not great resources themselves, and were not particular ly successful in their attempts to raise credits. Eske les was forced to report from Frankfort that he had no hope of success, \" e i t h e r in r a i s i n g money or in mortgaging the state lottery.\" In these depressing circumstances Vienna remembered the wealthy Elector of Hesse whom it had been treat - ing so shabbily, and it was suggested that he might be persuaded through Rothschild to grant a loan to Aus - tria. Barbier was entrusted with this mission, and dis- cussed it personally with the elector, and also inf ormed Rothschild of the matter. The elector replied evasi vely. He said that he must first discuss it with his advi sers; and Buderus had pointed out to his master that so m uch money was already on loan with private persons that it was not desirable to make further investments. Rothschild also advised against producing capital sums of the amount required by the Austrian court, al- though he felt \"that it was not desirable to give t he em- peror a rebuff.

He stated that he was not in a position to grant a loan in an y other way than that suggested, as eighteen months earlier he had purchased Austrian government stock of the valu e of over a million gulden, and funds in England had been sequestrated. If he recovered from his financial di fficul- ties he would be delighted to be of service to his Majesty. He enclosed a list of thirty-three different client s who owed him sums in varying amounts, ranging from 784, - 848 reichsthalers down to 6,951 reichsthalers. Apar t from several princely houses, the names of privy co un- cilors and counselors of embassies figured in these lists, as well as ministers such as Hardenberg, who owed t he elector 140,000 thalers. The total value of all the claims amounted to the sum of 5,832,532 reichsthalers. This proposal, however, came to nothing. The scheme put forward by Rothschild, and approved by the elec tor, had been too subtle and complicated, and on the ins truc- tions of Emperor Francis a reply was sent to the el ec- tor 49 declining the offer, on the ground that the collec - tion of the money would be a process too difficult and uncertain, and not consonant with the dignity of th e Aus- trian state.

Buderus had been continually molested by the French police, and Rothschild decided to put an end to thi s by persuading Dalberg to recognize the electoral offic ial as a deputy of the estates of the Grand Duchy of Frank fort on the occasion of the handing over of Hanau, and a lso to appoint him director of the finance committee of the diet. He hoped that when Buderus held this official po- sition he would be left in peace. Dalberg acceded to Rothschild's request. He steered his course very cleverly between the former powers who were now in exile and the new masters at Frankfort. It was very necessary that he should do so, for he cou ld not uproot himself from the city of his birth. All his pos- sessions were there, and the city was the principal com- mercial and financial center of the Continent. The Aus- trian ambassador Baron von Hugel reported enthusias - tically regarding the increasing prosperity of Fran kfort, which had conserved its wealth through all the diff icul- ties of the war period, and had actually grown rich er. \"Luxury,\" he wrote, 50 \"has increased incredibly.

The volume of goods passing through th e city is inconceivably great. Plutocratic standards obtain at Frankfort, and persons are judged by the magnifi cence of their establishments or by the appearances that they manage to keep up.\" Hugel pointed out that Frankfort was a focus for trade between northern and southern Germany, and th e gateway to France and Austria; and that no less tha n eight hundred of its citizens had admitted to posse ssing unencumbered cash to the sum of 50,000 gulden or mo re, while some hundreds enjoyed annual incomes of this amount and upwards. Although this description may have been paint ed rather rosily, it was, in essentials, in accordance with the facts. There were many people at Frankfort who had grown rich, and the rapidity of the rise of the Hou se of Rothschild to wealth and influence had been particu larly marked. In view of the progress of his business, Meyer Amschel now decided to define more clearly its inte rnal constitution; and more particularly to regulate his sons' share with greater accuracy than had been done with in the framework of the existing concern. On September 27, 1810, a new deed of partnership wa s accordingly drawn up between the father and his son s. 51 The main principle of this contract was that Meyer Am- schel gave all his sons a substantial share in the business in order to stimulate their industry. They became , not merely indirectly, but directly interested in its c ontinued prosperity.

The contract assessed the capital value of the busi ness at a total of 800,000 gulden, 370,000 gulden being al- lotted to the father, 185,000 gulden each to the so ns Amschel and Solomon, and 30,000 each to Carl and Ja mes, who had not yet conic of age. These shares were all otted to them as t h e i r absolute property, and it is notew orthy that Jacob (James) Rothschild, who was barely eight een years old, was allotted shares to the capital value of 30,000 gulden, as duly earned through the \"conscien tious carrying out of the business entrusted to him by th e old concern.\" For the purpose of dividing profit or loss, the bus iness was divided into fifty shares; a multiple of five, having the convenience of facilitating the future division of the business equally between the five brothers, while t he smaller fractions made it possible in the meantime to allot shares with due regard to the varying ages an d ca- pacities of the five sons. When the time came to di vide up the inheritance, each son could acquire an equal fifth share. On perusing the document, one is struck by the fact that Nathan, who was living in England, is not men- tioned in the partnership deed and seems to have be en left entirely to his own resources, although he was in close business association with the parent concern, and on the best terms with his family. Under the contra ct, twenty-four of the fifty shares were for the next t en years to belong to the father, twelve each to Amschel and Solo- mon, and one each to Carl and James. In point of fa ct, however, Meyer Amschel was holding the twelve-fif- tieths destined for Nathan; but for the sake of pub lic opinion, on account of the French domination, the c on- nection with Nathan, who was living in England, had to be kept secret.

Moreover, he expressly retained for himself alone t he right to withdraw money from the capital of the bus i- ness as he might think fit, whereas the other partn ers could take out only their annual profits and what w as necessary for their households. It was also laid down that no daughters or children - in-law should have any right to see the company's b ooks.

Meyer Amschel was careful to nurse the old connec- tions which the elector had facilitated for him thr ough his relations in high quarters, and to exploit them for the benefit of his house. Whereas previously he had acted as the middleman between the electoral lender and Denmark, he offered as early as December, 1810, 52 a loan of 400,000 thalers to Count Schimmelmann, the Danis h finance minister, which loan was to be advanced, no t by the elector, but by Meyer Amschel Rothschild and hi s sons. It was another step towards his gradual finan cial emancipation from the elector, although, having now ar- rived at the point of doing business on his own acc ount, he continued to apply in his own interests the busi ness principles so well proved by William of Hesse. Rothschild carefully watched the general political sit- uation. Though by reason of his personality and ori gin, and his ignorance of language, he could not possess those qualities which are normally required in a diplomat , he had a sagacious understanding of human nature, enti rely free of any preconceived ideas or prejudices. This was of particular advantage in a world which, at the ti me, was politically topsy-turvy. One really had to be a con- summate diplomatist in order to carry on one's busi ness without causing offense, either to the French or to the powers which they were oppressing. As long as Napoleon's star was in the ascendant, th e Rothschilds acted as if they were well disposed to France and her ruler; they lent money both to the French a nd to the native authorities, delivered flour to frien d and foe alike, and hoped to be left entirely unmolested by Napoleon. They felt, as we know today, more secure than they really were. They were running great risk s, for instance, in their commerce, or rather illicit trade, in merchandise with England.

He accordi ngly issued various decrees modifying the strict provisi ons of the continental blockade, so as to permit of a kind of official smuggling under departmental supervision, and also to allow the import of colonial goods on the p ay- ment of a very heavy duty approximating fifty per c ent of their value. In spite of these alleviations, smu ggling was carried on on a large scale, and its direction was naturally concentrated in the commercial city of Fr ank- fort. Napoleon had sent his own spies there, and on receiving their reports he decided to take more act ive measures against Frankfort. Buderus had just decided to give to the young crown agent, Carl Rothschild, who was about to attempt to bring to Prague the property which the elector had left in Schleswig, the final account for the year 1807, which the elector required. The official stated 53 that he was not inclined to venture on the journey himself, bec ause he was too closely watched, and feared a further ar rest, and the possible confiscation of all his property. His letter also contained news that would be welcom e to his avaricious master. \"After long arguments, and as the result of great efforts,\" he stated, \"I have per- suaded the crown agent, Rothschild, in effectin g the third investment of £150,000 sterling, to charge on e-quar- ter per cent less commission, so that he will deliv er the stock for 73 3/4, involving a saving of £4,521. . . .

The city which had just been described in such glowing colors by Hugel was now i n a panic. Naturally the business House of Rothschild was also affected by this measure.

Altogether the French col- lected a total of nine and a quarter millions on th e co- lonial stores discovered at Frankfort. Half the amo unt payable by Rothschild was for indigo. In view of Me yer Amschel's relations with the grand ducal government and his cleverness at concealment, we may assume th at his actual stores of colonial goods were much great er, and that through his connections he substantially r educed the amount which he ought to have paid. Nevertheles s this sudden incursion, personally ordered by Napole on, had distinctly alarmed him. Meanwhile the elector at Prague had received Bu- derus's letters, and sent the following reply to hi s trusty official: 56 \"It is a special satisfaction to me that you have induced the firm of Rothschild, in view of the pros pect of the further investment of £150,000, to reduce th eir commission by one-quarter per cent. \"In view of further representations made by the cro wn agent Rothschild, and having regard to the favorabl e price, I have decided to increase this investment b y a further £100,000 . . . but on the understanding tha t I shall pay this amount in instalments, and that I am not to be worried about it in any way.

The Grand Duke Dalberg, in Frankfort, also desired to go to Paris to do obeisance, but there was a for midable obstacle in the way of his doing so. The journey wa s very expensive, and Dalberg could not visit Paris e xcept with a retinue such as befitted his rank. But he ha d no retinue, and in the first instance he turned for as sistance to the association of Frankfort merchants, requesti ng them to lend him eighty thousand gulden for the jou r- ney to Paris. The merchants, who disliked the Napoleonic regime, and could not agree as to the proportions in which the money should be subscribed, declined the request.

Apart from their own business, al l the members of the family who were capable of trave l- ing were constantly on the road, in order to transa ct per- sonally the important business of the elector at va rious places. This is most clearly revealed in the corres pon- dence between Buderus and the elector. \"Young Rothschild,\" he wrote from Hanau to his master on April 7, 1811, 58 \"is actually on his way to Lon- don to fetch the certificates of title regarding yo ur in- vestment of capital.

In an y case there is no reason to expect anything untoward from that quarter.\" Buderus was unceasing in his efforts to exalt the R oths- child family in the opinion of the elector, and to repre- sent all other business houses as unreliable or les s accom- modating. This was shown in the case of a transacti on of earlier origin. The elector had transferred to M eyer Amschel Rothschild and two other Jewish bankers fro m Cassel an amount of a million Dutch gulden due to h im in Holland. In accomplishing this various technical difficulties arose which delayed the payment of the sum in Holland, while the transferees of the debt had a lready paid out the greater part of the sum involved. Befo re making further payments, they naturally asked the e lec- tor for a guarantee. In righteous indignation Buderus reported this to h is master: 60 \"The worst of this business is that it was not entrusted to one single business firm. . . . The ag ents Stuben Hesse Goldschmidt and the heirs of Michel Si mon are most ill-disposed toward your Electoral Highnes s. Levy, Simon's son-in-law, who manages the business, has gone to such extremes that, as I know for certain, he caused the recent arrest of myself and Rothschild, and furnished the police commissary with the questions on which we were cross-examined with extreme severity. \" Buderus how proposed that the Cassel Jews should be made to retire from the business, and that the matt er should be entrusted to Meyer Amschel Rothschild alo ne.

In general, however, the elector was again in an ex - ceedingly bad mood, first, because Rothschild had s till not succeeded in bringing his property from Holstei n to Prague, and secondly, because he had received a re- port from Buderus regarding an electoral loan which had been made to a family called Plettenberg throug h the intermediary of Prince Wittgenstein, the recove ry of which seemed highly doubtful. He was also anno yed by a suggestion made by Buderus that he should agai n take part in Frankfort loans, of which he had had s uch an unfortunate experience. It was in a highly ne rvous condition that he awaited the documents regarding h is investment in English stocks, which had not yet com e to hand. This mood found expression in an exceedi ngly angry letter, in which the elector notified the ces sation of payments to Rothschild in respect to the En glish stocks, thereby causing a positive panic in the Rot hschild- Buderus firm.

This question had indeed become the crucial problem in general European politics. A t Erfurt the opinion had obtained for a time in 1808 that Napoleon and Alexander of Russia would be able to share the dominion of Europe between them. The Em- peror of France had particularly in view that he mi ght finally be enabled to subdue England with the assis tance of Russia. For this purpose it was essential that Russia shoul d unconditionally adopt the continental blockade; but the tsar never contemplated sacrificing all his trade w ith England for the sake of Napoleon. On the contrary, he facilitated the import of goods by sea, and goods o f Eng- lish origin could now easily find their way to othe r con- tinental states via Russia. Thus the effectiveness of Na- poleon's measures was endangered, and as early as t he summer of 1811 it was obvious to the whole of Europ e that a complete breach between the two most powerfu l continental states was inevitable, and that war was now only a question of time. The Napoleonic police consequently applied a much more rigid censorship to all correspondence and sec ret agreements in territories subject to French rule. A ny- thing addressed tb the ruling family of Hesse was s ub- jected to a particularly close scrutiny. A letter d ated Frankfort, November 1, 1811, 68 which carelessly men- tioned Meyer Amschel's name in two places, and was ad- dressed to the elector's brother, Landgrave Karl, f ell into the hands of the French. In one passage the unknown writer acknowledged the receipt of a letter from th e landgrave, through the good offices of Meyer Amsche l, while another passage read as follows: 69 "},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"The Napoleonic Era ior \"I deliberately read to Rothschild, in his sons' pr es- ence, the passage in which your Highness speaks of them so kindly and graciously.

This letter was immediately forwarded from Hamburg, where it had been intercepted, to General Savary, the commission er of police at Paris, who instructed Baron Bacher, th e French ambassador at Frankfort, to furnish any ligh t he could as to the implication of the letter and the p arts played by the persons mentioned in it. Baron Bacher suggested 70 that they should not proceed against the family Rothschild by domiciliary search and arrest as in 1809, but should act with greater cunn ing. The House of Rothschild and the other agents of the elector should be lulled into a complete sense of s ecurity; their letters should be skilfully opened, copied, a nd then forwarded. In this way Bacher hoped in a very short lime to familiarize himself with their network of i ntrigue in all its complicated ramifications. The chief commissioner of police also asked for a r e- port from his commissioner at Mainz, and the letter in- formed him 71 that the House of Rothschild had formerly been exceedingly active in the trade of colonial go ods and English manufactures. But since they had been s ub- jected to a domiciliary search and had had their En glish goods sequestrated, they had occupied themselves pr inci- pally with banking business, and commerce in goods con- fined to the Continent.

Dalberg's police commis- sioner, von Itzstein, who although a Jew, was direc tor of the police of the grand duchy, was a particular patron of Meyer Amschel and of all the Frankfort Jews. Meyer Amschel Rothschild had long cherished the idea of exploiting Dalberg's friendly feelings for the Jews in the interests of the fellow members of his faith who had formerly been so oppressed, and incidentall y of his own family. It is true that a new \"status\" p ro- claimed by Dalberg had somewhat improved their con- dition, but it involved no essential change. For ex am- ple, the number of Jewish families tolerated remain ed at five hundred. \"Five hundred, only five,\" indigna ntly wrote a certain Israel Jakobsohn. \"Why not more, an d why not less?\" 72 Dalberg, seeing that he could exploit this situatio n and do a good business deal, allowed Meyer Amschel and his partner Gumprecht to persuade him to commute the annual amount of 22,000 gulden payable by the Jews, into a lump sum, and to grant them the rights of ci tizen- ship in Frankfort, thereby making them the politica l equals of the Christians.

Jewish circles awaited wit h considerable suspense, the conclusion of these arra nge- ments, which were so important for their future. If the proposal went through, Meyer Amschel wanted to be the first to bring the good news to the fellow memb ers of his faith. As he was constantly being begged for information by members of the Jewish community, he requested a recorder of the province, who was friendly to him, to let him have the earliest possible information: \"I shou ld be most pleased,\" he wrote to him in his peculiar G er- man, 73 \"if I could be the first messenger of the good new s, as soon as it has been signed by his Royal Highness , our most excellent Lord and great Duke, in our favor an d that I can inform my nation of their great joy, wil l you graciously inform me of it through the post, I conf ess I abuse your goodness and grace, but I do not doubt that your Highness and your honored family have to await great heavenly rewards and will receive much happin ess and blessing . . . because in truth our whole Jewry , if they have the happiness to obtain equal rights, wil l gladly pay with great pleasure all dues that the citizens have to pay.\" After some time the matter was put through, and aroused as much enthusiasm amongst the Jews as indi g- nation in the senate and amongst the patrician fami lies, who were hostile to them.

T he debentures, to the value of 290,000 gulden, were im me- diately brought into circulation. One of them, of t he value of fifty thousand, was acquired by Dalberg's fi- nance minister, Count Christian von Benzel-Sternau; eight debentures of ten thousand gulden each were t aken over by Herr von Bethmann, while the greater part o f the amount paid by the Jews in cash went direct to Paris as a payment on account of the electoral domains in Fulda and Hanau, which had been seized by the French, and which Dalberg had repurchased on taking over these two principalities. The grand duke immediately sold the domains again to private persons for earnest money of three and o ne- half million francs, payable by instalments, a tran saction which, when concluded, would yield 190,000 francs m ore than France had received for the domains.

Meyer Amschel's conduct had made him by no means popular with the former authorities of the city; but for the time be ing they had to look on in impotence, and allow him and his protector Dalberg to have their way. It was with the greatest suspense that they watched the course of general European politics. The poin ts at i ss u e between Napoleon and Russia had already almos t resulted in war.

But all that Europe saw was the vic- torious advance. Owing to the prevailing conditions it was weeks, even months, before further news reached Frankfort. The merchants of that time could not adj ust their affairs to events as speedily as scientific d iscoveries have now enabled them to do. Meyer Amschel Rothschild's attitude was entirely de - termined by his sense of the overwhelming power of the Corsican, who was now at Moscow, when the reopening of his old wound quite unexpectedly brought him bac k to his sick-bed. He did not live to see Napoleon's com- plete failure in Russia, to be followed a year late r by his defeat in Germany, which was followed by the return to his Hessian domains of Rothschild's lord and master the elector. On September 16, 1812, a high Jewish Feast Day, the so-called \"long day\" which is set apart for the par don- ing of the penitent sinner, Meyer Amschel had been fast- ing, in accordance with his strict religious princi ples, and spent many hours standing in the synagogue, sun k in prayer. The same evening he felt severe pains in th e re- gion of his wound. He was immediately put to bed, b ut his condition grew worse. He had violent attacks of fever, and he felt that death was approaching. Ther e- upon he determined, while he still had the strength in him, to order his affairs, and to make a new will a dapted to the most recent developments, to take the place of the earlier will which he had made. In doing so he was giving effect to an agreement wh ich he had made with all his children, and in accordanc e with which he sold to his five sons all his shares in the business, his securities and other possessions, as well as his large stocks of wine, for the sum of 190,000 gu lden, which of course was far below their real value. His sons were henceforth to be the exclusive owners of the business, and it was clear, although not definitely stated,"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"The Napoleonic Era 107 that after their father's death any inequality in t heir shares ceased, and each of the five sons henceforth pos- sessed ten-fiftieths, that is, a fifth share, in th e business. The will completely excluded the daughters and thei r husbands and heirs from the business, and even from all knowledge of it. Meyer Amschel applied the purchase price of 190,000 gulden as follows: he granted his wife Gutle a life interest in 70,000 gulden; the remaind er he divided amongst his five daughters. This arrangemen t served a double object. First, it made it unnecessa ry on his death to declare to the officials the enormous value, for those times, of the business that was divided b etween the five sons, and to put the capital bequeathed at the modest figure of 190,000 gulden. Secondly, the busi ness was secured absolutely to the five sons, safe from the pos- sibility of any interference from the sisters and t heir rela- tions. The will concluded 77 by enjoining unity, love and friendship upon the children, and any undutiful chi ld that showed an intention of rebelling was threatene d with the penalty of inheriting no more than the legal mi ni- mum, which was only to be reckoned on the basis of the 190,000 gulden, from which would have to be deducte d anything that the child in question had received du ring his life.

When Meyer Amschel had thus done everything that lay in his power to secure the future prosperity of his House—which, it is true, he considered in terms onl y of financial gain—and by clear and simple provision to maintain unity and peace amongst his numerous famil y, he could look death calmly in the face. Two days af ter he had completed his will, on the evening of Septem ber 19, 1812, his old complaint took a marked turn for the worse. The alpha and omega of medical practice of t he time was to let blood, a procedure which simply ser ved to weaken old people who were very ill, instead of giv- ing them relief. At a quarter past eight on the eve ning of the same day, Meyer Amschel Rothschild, the tire less, cunning, simple, and religious Jew, and founder of the banking firm M. A.

In his last hours he was fully aware that he was le av- ing a fine inheritance to his sons, but he certainl y could not have guessed that he had laid the foundation of a world power which during the first half of the nine - teenth century was to exercise an unparalleled infl uence throughout Europe, and was to maintain this influen ce almost unimpaired throughout the changing condition s of the second half of the century."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"CHAPTER III The Great Napoleonic Crisis and Its Exploitation by the House of Rothschild INCE the French Revolution, the Continent of Eu- rope had been continuously suffering from the tur- moil of war, while large territories were subjected to the horrors of the actual battles between the opposing armies. On the other hand, sea-girt England, although she e x- erted a powerful political influence upon the conti nental groups, was able to devote her principal attention, prac- t i c a l l y undisturbed, to the development of her comm erce and the prosperity of her citizens. Through his financial reforms which had assisted th e capitalistic development of the state, the younger Pitt had brought order into Britain's internal affairs a nd thereby made it possible for England, out of her gr owing wealth, to advance very considerable sums of money to her allies, who were waging war on the Continent wi th the wealth and the blood of their citizens. Towards the close of the eighteenth century England was indispu ta- bly the most important commercial power in Europe, and the House of Rothschild had made an exceedingly clever move in arranging that one of its sons, and the most talented one at that, should take up his resid ence in that kingdom. Nathan had first settled in Manchester, the center for the manufacture of all kinds of cloth, as he had lo ng had business connections with that city.

Nathan , therefore, came to Manchester, not as a small trade sman, but as a fairly important representative of an esta blished commercial firm on the Continent, with money at his command. He entered upon his commercial activities with all the enthusiasm of youth, at the same time showing a bus i- ness acumen remarkable in one so young. He first ca re- fully studied his environment, and his neighbor's m eth- ods of making money, and ascertained that profits w ere made on the purchase of the raw materials necessary for the manufacture of cloth and on the issue of these mate- rials for dyeing purposes, as well as on the sale o f the finished article, each of these activities in Engla nd be- ing the province of a separate merchant. Nathan determined to secured for himself the profit at each stage in the process. 1 He bought the raw materials on his own account, had them dyed, and then gave th em out to undergo the further processes of manufacture , and finally himself handed them over to the trade. Nath an did not confine himself exclusively to cloth. He bo ught everywhere, and anything that he thought was good a nd cheap. Thus he bought all kinds of fancy goods, as well as colonial produce such as indigo, wine, sugar, an d cof- fee. He was not troubled about finding a market, as the parent firm at home required all these things. The capital which he brought with him was soon dou- bled and trebled, while his father and brothers der ived the greatest benefit from Nathan's presence in Engl and. He enjoyed the life in that country, which struck h im as extraordinarily free and unfettered, compared wi th the oppressive conditions in Frankfort. As his business grew, Nathan naturally began to est ab- lish contact with the capital, which is the heart o f Great Britain, and in which all the financial interests o f an"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"The Great Napoleonic Crisis 111 extensive empire are concentrated. Determined to se ttle in England for good, he left Manchester in 1804 for London, where he would be in closer touch with thos e political developments which were producing such pr o- found effect upon commercial life. He realized at o nce that the fact that he was a foreigner was a great h andi- cap in business, and therefore, as early as the sum mer of the year 1806, he applied for naturalization as a Brit- ish subject. His wish was readily granted, as the a ppli- cant had resided for six years in the country, and even if he had not yet attained a very prominent positio n in the business world, he was already honored and resp ected. Favored by the keen demand for goods on the Conti- nent, Nathan carried on his business in London with great success, until the year 1806. His intimate ex peri- ence of English life and character, and his sympath y with the spirit of resistance to Napoleon's plans of wor ld domi- nation which inspired the whole country, soon cause d him to adhere completely to English modes of though t. But he avoided publicly identifying himself with an y political cause which might have damaged his family Frankfort, and all his actions were guided first an d foremost by business considerations. Nathan was now twenty-nine years old, and was con- templating marriage. He had made the acquaintanc e of the daughter of a rich Jewish family. Her fat her, who had emigrated from Amsterdam, had several small business dealings with Nathan, but their relations had not been sufficiently intimate to enable him to for m an accurate estimate regarding the suitor's financial posi- tion and general business qualities. The fact tha t Na- than was living abroad made investigations of this nature more difficult.

Moreover, his wife's sister Judith Cohen shortly af ter- wards married the rich and well-known Moses Monte- fiore, who was thus brought into close association with Nathan, and whose energy, foresight, and sound busi - ness sense in regard to all the vicissitudes of the conti- nental wars, which so intimately affected financial opera- tions, Nathan had constant occasion to admire. Nathan had as yet nothing to do with the elector's in- vestments in England, although his father at Frankf ort was endeavoring to get him this business, and had r e- peatedly urged him to cultivate relations with the elec- tor's plenipotentiary in London. The intimations of the elector's wishes, hitherto received by Count Lorent z, had not been favorable to such an arrangement, but this in no way discouraged Meyer Amschel at Frankfort, or Nathan in London, from continuing their efforts. As has already been stated, the elector soon changed h is opin- ion, and we are now entering upon the period of the in- vestment of large sums in English stocks, as recomm ended by Nathan. In view of his intimate relations with M eyer Amschel, the elector could not continue to object t o the employment of his son Nathan in transacting the bus i- ness in London. Another factor in Nathan's favor was the difficulty of getting possession of the documents certifying t he pur- chases of stock, this being not so difficult for Na than to arrange, in view of his numerous Jewish and non-Jew - ish connections. Thus Nathan came to be interested in the enormous financial operations of the elector, a nd as considerable periods of time could be made to inter vene between the purchase and the payment of the securit ies, he sometimes had temporary control of very substant ial"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"The Great Napoleonic Crisis 113 sums of money, which he could employ in safe, short - term transactions, such as, for instance, the purch ase of bullion, which was constantly rising in value at th at time. It was not known in England how Nathan came to have such sums of money temporarily at his disposal, for the purchases of English stocks on the elector's accoun t were officially made in the name of Rothschild, and appa rently for the benefit of that firm, as the elector's fund s in Eng- land had already been sequestered once. The credit of the House of Rothschild and of Nathan cer t a i n l y gained greatly from these enormous purcha ses, and he came to be entrusted with transactions which , even if he could not immediately meet his obligations in cash, he did not like to lose, as they offered good prosp ects for the future. Nathan was particularly skilful at ex ploit- ing the abnormal conditions of the period, conditi ons such as always give those with a gift for speculati on an opportunity of enriching themselves, while those wh o stand by passively are reduced to poverty.

But it soon became apparent that it was essential to have an absolutely reliable man at Paris too, to deal with this busi- ness. Nathan had written to Frankfort to this effec t, and old Meyer Amschel had decided to profit by his good relations with Dalberg's French regime at Frankfort to obtain a Paris passport vise from the French offici als for one of his sons, to whom alone he was prepared to e ntrust so important a position, and also to obtain a lette r of rec- ommendation for him to one of the higher French Tre as- ury officials. A particularly favorable opportunity for this occur red when Dalberg set out for Paris in March, 1811, with the money advanced by Rothschild. It is certainly no me re coincidence that, according to the French police re cords, 2 James, who was then nineteen years old, started to Paris via Antwerp, and took up his residence in a private house there. It is particularly worthy of note that Count Mollien, Napoleon's finance minister at the time, h ad been informed of young Rothschild's arrival, and kn ew of his intention to receive and forward large sums of ready money that were expected from England. \"A Frankforter,\" the minister wrote to Napoleon on March 26, 1811, \"who is now staying in Paris with a Frankfort passport, and goes by the name of Rothsch ild, is principally occupied in bringing British ready m oney from the English coast to Dunkirk, and has in this way brought over 100,000 guineas in one month.

S uch op- erations would be on a par with the practices of th e Aus- trians or the Russians. I sincerely hope that the F rank- forter Rothschild is well informed of these matters , and that ministers in London will be sufficiently fooli sh to act in this way.\" 3 This letter reveals much; it shows that while James Rothschild may have been in Paris before the 24th o f March, 1811, without the permission of the police, as soon as he officially arrived, that is, as soon as he re ported to the Paris police, he must have had an interview wit h the minister or with one of the officials of the treasu ry, this being no doubt due to Dalberg's introduction. Alt hough in sending the guineas to Frankfort Nathan was gene rally acting in accordance with quite definite plans that suited the British government, James, in order to gain the sup- port of the French departments for these operations , pre- tended to the ministry at Paris that the English au thori- ties viewed the export of cash with extreme displea sure, and did everything possible to prevent it. He suc ceeded only too well in hoodwinking Mollien, and through h im, Napoleon. \"The French government,\" says Marion, 4 \"viewed with satisfaction the arrival of English guineas at the Channel ports, because they regarded this both as a proof a nd as a cause of the progressive decay of England.\" It i s true that in his memoirs Mollien afterward tried to sugg est that he did not share this view, and that Napoleon de- rived it from others, but the letter quoted above c learly shows that the finance minister also believed Roths child. Nathan wanted just at this time to send exceptional ly large sums of ready money to France, having the sec ret intention that these should ultimately be destined for Wellington's armies, who were fighting the French i n Spain.

It was not only that the blocka de made it difficult to transport large sums by sea, b ut the devastating storms in the Bay of Biscay were a seri ous menace to the cumbrous sailing ships of those times . Such consignments were therefore liable to grave risks, and the insurance charges were exceedingly heavy. As early as 1809 Wellington had had occasion to wri te to his government in the following terms: \"We are t er- ribly in need of funds. . . . The army pay is two m onths in arrears. I feel that the Ministry in England is utterly indifferent to our operations here. 5 ... It would be much better for the Governments,\" he added some tim e later, 6 \"entirely to give up our operations in Portugal and Spain if the country cannot afford to continue them.\" This state of affairs continued for two years, and Well- ington had to have recourse to highly dubious banke rs and money-lenders in Malta, Sicily, and Spain, from whom he had to borrow money at the most usurious rates, giving them bills of exchange which had to be cashed by th e British Treasury at great loss. The measures taken by the treasury for satisfying the requirements of Welling ton's army were always quite inadequate; finally the Brit ish commander wrote indignantly to London 7 that if matters continued thus, his army would have to leave the Pe nin- sula, which would relieve France of important milit ary commitments on the Continent, and expose England to the danger of having a hostile force landed on the island itself. Then his exalted monarch and his subjects w ould experience in their own country something of the ho rrors of war, from which they had hitherto had the good f or- tune to be spared. A year later things were not much better, and on be ing reproached for having too casually drawn bills on t he English government, Wellington replied with some he at, writing that he was sorry to have to state that sic k and wounded British officers at Salamanca had been forc ed to sell their clothes in order to keep body and soul t ogether. 8 "},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"The Great Napoleonic Crisis 117 Such were the conditions under which the British ar my was fighting in Spain, when an energetic movement i n its support was started in London, which at first w as directed by Nathan Rothschild on his own account. He had acquired very cheaply a large proportion of the bills issued by Wellington, and proceeded to cash them at the British Treasury. The cash which he thus received — generally in the form of guineas—he sent across t he Channel to France, where it was received by one of his brothers, generally by James, but in 1812 sometimes by Carl or Solomon, and then paid in to various Paris bank- ing firms. The brothers obtained from the Paris b ankers bills on Spanish, Sicilian, or Maltese bankers, and they contrived, through their business connections, to g et these papers to Wellington, who duly received the cash fr om the bankers. Thus the cash sent from London actua lly only had to make the short journey from London to P aris, and thence through the intricate network of busines s firms, who were mostly Jewish, it finally reached t he English commander in Spain, through the heart of th e enemy's country. As time passed, however, the supply of cash a nd precious metal began to be scarce, even in England. Nathan, who had concentrated his attention principa lly upon business in specie and bills of exchange since the blockade had made ordinary commerce so d ifficult, closely watched 4 for favorable opportunities of acquir- ing any consignments of specie that might be availa ble.

A sailing ship carrying money had again been held up somewher e for weeks, and another consignment which had arrive d safely at Lisbon encountered extraordinary difficul ties in its further transportation. The British government, and especially Herries, were in the greatest distress. They then heard of Nathan Rothschild's purchase of gold from the East India Company, and the almost un - known man who had acquired it was sent for by the t reas- ury. Nathan sold the gold to the government at a he avy profit, and, at the same time requested that he sho uld be commissioned to convey the money through France to Wellington in Spain, as he had already been doing t o a limited extent at his own expense, asking that he s hould now do it on a large scale on account of the Britis h gov- ernment. Very substantial sums of money indeed were involved , which were sent across the Channel from England to France, as is shown by a letter from James in Paris to Nathan in London, dated April 6, 1812, which was in ter- cepted by the Paris police. Nathan had at that time sent 27,300 English guineas and 2,002 Portuguese gold ou nces in six separate instalments through six different f irms, to James at Gravelines. James acknowledged the receipt of these amounts, and of bills on the firms of Hott inguer, Davillier, Morel and Faber, to the amount of £65,79 8. He added that he was glad that it had been possible to send him this money without affecting the rate of e x- change, and urged his brother to let him have any c om- mercial news at the earliest possible moment.

Meanwhile gold pieces were trickl ing through in complete security, under the eyes and in deed under the protection of the French government, acro ss France itself, into the pockets of France's arch-en emy, Wellington. But though Mollien was deceived, the activities of the Jewish emigrants from Frankfort were being watched with great suspicion in other quarters. Letters from a local merchant to one of the Rothschilds at Dunkirk , which were intercepted by the French police, reveal ed the nature of their activities.

However, things had not yet reached this point. Through his enormous energy, Napoleon succeeded in rapidly improvising a new army, with which he meant to turn the tide of events.

In the public streets of Hesse the cry was heard, \"Long live the elector, long live Ru ssia!\" Napoleon's so-called allies in the Russian campaign fell away, one after the other.

The bond between these became closer as time went o n. England again offered Prussia and Russia her all-po wer- ful financial support. In the Treaty of Reichenbach of June 14, 1813, she offered Prussia £666,666 as a su bsidy, if that kingdom would put eighty thousand men in th e field.

At this critical time the most important services w ere rendered to the Frankfort firm, not by its new chie f, but by his incomparably more talented brother Natha n, in England, whose flair for finance amounted to pos itive genius. He now enjoyed the elector's full confidenc e. When in 1812 the Prince Regent of England seemed to be inclined to repay £100,000, Nathan was instructe d to receive this amount, and to invest it in consols. T his transaction brought him into immediate touch with t he private finances of the royal family. As Great Britain was the financier of the powers wh ich were fighting on the Continent, and was also mainta ining armies of her own abroad, enormous demands were mad e on the British Treasury in 1813. The officials were not equal to the task of raising the money or of sendin g it to the Continent. It had already been necessary for a nat- uralized foreigner to demonstrate that there were o ther ways of raising and sending money than for Englishm en abr o a d to draw bills on England. That method had a very bad effect on the English rate of exchange, wh ich at the end of 1813 had already fallen by one-third. Herries, who was charged with the sole responsibili ty for sending money to the Continent, again called in Na- than Rothschild to his assistance. While his princi pal problem was to supply the enormous sums that Englan d had to provide under the subsidy contracts that she had just concluded, it was even more urgent and more im por- tant for the final overthrow of Napoleon to afford every possible support to Wellington, who was still press ing for money, but who was now free to advance into Fre nch territory, as Napoleon had transferred his best tro ops and generals to Germany.

The technical problem wa s now somewhat different, since Wellington attached m ost importance to being supplied with French currency. In the interests of England, as well as of his own pocket, Nathan had hitherto worked almost consistently agai nst Napoleon; but he had done it as inconspicuously as pos- sible for fear of compromising his brothers on the Con- tinent. Even now that Napoleon was retreating, and was soon to be fighting within the former frontiers of France itself, he still kept well in the background, altho ugh he adopted the anti-Napoleonic cause with all the more en- thusiasm, since the Russian disaster and the defeat at Leipzig seemed to imply the end of Napoleon's power . Lord Liverpool, first lord of the treasury and prim e min- ister, and Vansittart, chancellor of the exchequer, ap- proved the scheme submitted by Herries, and in a se cret letter entrusted its execution to Nathan's experien ce and discretion. Nathan Rothschild thereupon proceeded personally to Holland and collected, in close cooperation with hi s brothers, the French metal currency with which the Con- tinent was flooded, but which, owing to the blockad e, was naturally unobtainable in England. 19 James also ac- quired French cash on the spot in Paris, and manage d to smuggle it across to his brothers in Holland. Th e sums thus collected were then shipped from the Dutch coa st to Wellington's headquarters, this transaction beco ming easier as his troops advanced from the west coast o f France.

In later years Nathan himself stated that this was the best business he had ever done. 20 Meanwhile the victorious allies had advanced beyond Frankfort, and had established their general headqu arters in that city. The Emperor Alexander of Russia, the King of Prussia, and the Emperor Francis met in the anci ent city where the Holy Roman Emperors were crowned. Metternich came with them, rejoicing in the triumph of his policy. The outward signs of the great change i n the political situation were therefore particularly app arent at Frankfort, the home of the Rothschilds. It is not surprising that the family regulated thei r fu- ture conduct accordingly. As yet they had had no re la- tions with Austrian statesmen, but the brothers Rot hschild now proceeded to sound members of the imperial ento ur- age with a view to getting an opening. Accompanying Metternich was a previous acquaintance of theirs, B ar- bier, vice-president of the Austrian Treasury, who was responsible for the financial arrangements of the A ustrian army.

As far as can be ascertained, he had had neither offic ial nor personal relations with the Rothschild family befor e the year 1813. Metternich was conscious of his own uncertainty in financial matters, and therefore relied largely on the ad- vice of his indispensable secretary and counselor, the brilliant publicist Frederick von Gentz. This man h ad got to know the count intimately during the years 1 802- 1803, while he was still in the Prussian civil serv ice and Metternich, who recognized his distinguished litera ry talent, was ambassador at Dresden; and it was Mette rnich who induced him to transfer to the Austrian civil s ervice. Gentz was even worse than Metternich at managing his private affairs, and unlike the count, was comp letely unscrupulous in getting money from anybody he could , from his own or from foreign states, from persons w ho desired orders or titles, and wherever opportunity offered. In spite of this, and of the fact that he often man aged to earn considerable sums of money with his pen, he wa s in a constant state of financial embarrassment owing t o his extravagant manner of life, and was repeatedly on t he verge of complete ruin. This, however, did not prev ent him from being always on the most intimate terms wi th all the great men of his day, with poets and states men, with princes and the higher nobility, as well as wi th Jew- ish bankers and merchants.

It is weakness , and not extravagance that has brought him to this p ass.\" Later events were to give the lie to this statement of Hum- boldt's; it would scarcely have been possible for a nyone to dissipate money more thoughtlessly and extravagantl y than Gentz. In spite of these personal characteristics, Gentz h ad a bent for political economy, and had taken a very go od course in that subject in England, where he stayed for some time. While studying in that country he had ma de the personal acquaintance of Herries, who translate d sev- eral of his writings into English, and maintained a cor- respondence with him. He also told him of the firm of Rothschild. Gentz did not stay with Metternich at g en- eral headquarters, but he corresponded with him con - stantly on financial matters. The Austrian state was again urgently in need of fu nds for continuing hostilities, as it had been decided to carry the war into the enemy's country across the Rhine. The immediate problem was to convert into cash the rema in- ing instalments of the subsidies from England. This had been done hitherto by the four Viennese banking fir ms, but the government was not very satisfied with thei r services, and Gentz, for personal reasons apparentl y, was not on good terms with them. He therefore wrote to Metternich to say that as far as he was aware, the four Viennese firms had no exclusive right to conduct th e financial affairs of the state, and recommended the Frank- fort banker von Herz. But he too proved to be very dis- appointing; he succeeded in making several hundred thousand for himself, but got rid of the bills at a bsurdly low rates, thereby also damaging English credit. Th e problem as to who should carry through these transa ctions still remained to be solved. A letter from Count Ugarte to Metternich indicated how much they were exercised as to the best means o f getting the English money over. 24 Ugarte observed that"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"132 The Rise of the House of Rothschild in the past the English government had generally se nt the subsidies in cash, and in gold and silver bars, whi le only a small portion of them had been realized through \"me r- cantile\" channels.

Now there were several cogent reasons for the emplo y- ment of Frankfort firms. They naturally did what th ey could to bring influence to bear in this direction, on Met- ternich and his advisers, and Ambassador Baron von Hugel pleaded the cause of the Frankfort bankers. H e had already on a previous occasion written to Count Stadion to say that of all the cities in Germany, F rank- fort ought to be specially considered in connection with the financial measures of the imperial court. He sa id that there was no commercial center in Europe that would collaborate as readily as Frankfort in efforts to i mprove Austria's credit. To crown all, Metternich simultaneously received a dispatch from the ambassador in London, Baron von Wessenberg, stating that the four Vienna firms had hope- lessly mismanaged the realization of the English bi lls of exchange. 25 They had made the mistake of instructing no less than four firms on the same day and in the same market, to obtain bills on Paris and Amsterdam, so that their joint action naturally forced up the rate of exchange."},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"The Great Napoleonic Crisis 133 The imperial treasury had thereby incurred a loss o f thousands of pounds, which would have been avoided if the business had been carried through by a single f irm which would not have feared the competition of its rivals.

He also co m- manded that careful investigations were to be made as to the most advantageous method of procedure, adding t hat since he understood from a trustworthy source that the four firms had not handled the matter in a practica l way, and the business could be carried through much more profitably from Frankfort, no further contracts sho uld be made with those firms unless it could be shown that that was the best and most certain method of achieving t he desired object. Ugarte had requested the four banking firms to send in a written reply to the statement contained in Wesse nberg's report, since he himself was inclined to support th em, as they charged a commission of only one-quarter per c ent; and he instructed Barbier at Frankfort to report as to whether the bills could really have been cashed at a much higher figure in that city. At this point Me tter- nich intervened, also urging that Frankfort should be con- sidered. Thereupon Ugarte summoned a secret commi s- sion at Vienna, and this commission naturally prono unced in favor of the four well-established local banking firms, whose credit stood high and who could be controlled more effectively, as they were on the spot. 27 Meanwhile imperial headquarters had been shifted to F r e i b u r g in Switzerland, where Gentz joined Metter- nich.

That was at any rate a start. Meantime the shortage of money at army headquarters in Freiburg had become acute.

Austria was to receive £1,666,666 2/3 or a mo nthly payment of £138,888 2/3. In point of fact there was never occasion to pay out this sum, for the allies soon g ained a decisive victory over Napoleon, and entered Paris o n March 31; whereupon, after Napoleon's abdication, t he first Peace of Paris was signed. The elector immediately sent his sincerest congratu la- tions to the emperor as the liberator of Europe, as usual accompanying this expression of feeling with a requ est that he should be compensated for his losses. 29 The elector had been a profitable example to the Rothsc hild family. He was always importuning the authorities t o protect his interests, but he did so in rather an a ggressive manner, whereas the Rothschild brothers, though no less persevering, always contrived so to frame their req uests that they seemed to be concerned only for the inter ests of the state or the person with whom the decision lay."},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"The Great Napoleonic Crisis 135 Austria had already received the English payments d ue to her for the first three months of the year.

The firm of Rothschild put in for this busi ness, and in order to support it, Herries had proposed to Vienna that Austria should arrange for the money to be sent through Frankfort. In agreement with Nathan Rothschild, the Englishman, who regarded Frankfort as the most important financial center in Germany, had ap- pointed his own plenipotentiary in that city, a cer tain Chevalier von Limburger, who was to conduct any neg o- tiations regarding subsidies.

On August 5 he had an - other interview with Barbier, and gave it as his op inion that the English rate of exchange was then very fav or- able. He stated that he had received a communicatio n from Limburger on the previous day and, in accordan ce therewith, he desired to make a definite and advant ageous offer in writing regarding the realization of the f urther subsidies due to Austria. Barbier reported this offer to Vienna, adding that he had taken no steps to conclude the arrangement, and ended by saying: \"The House of Rothschild now does more business in English paper than all other firms put together, and this may be largely due to the fact t hat one member of the firm is established in London and ano ther in Paris, and that the firm has to carry through se veral substantial remittances of money on account of the Eng- lish government itself.\" 34 The fundamental idea at the back of Herries's mind, a plan that Nathan had inspired, was that in view of the English government's unfortunate experience of the methods of middlemen, it should itself control the reali- zation of the subsidies, and thereby prevent the fr ustra- tion of its efforts for improving the English rate of exchange. Whilst Nathan supported Herries in thes e ef- forts, he profited by the occasion to get his firm estab- lished with the continental powers, and to induce H erries to entrust him with the remittance of the English s ub- sidies to the three greatest powers, mindful that t he con- nections thereby resulting would enable the firm in the course of time to secure other important business w ith the financial administrations of those powers.

The offer w as duly sent in and forwarded to Vienna by Barbier. At the same time he observed to Rothschild that it was too vagu e to be accepted, and that this was not an ordinary bank ing transaction subject to the usual business risks, bu t was based on the proposal of the English commissary-gen - eral, and was therefore of an official nature. Rothschild replied that Limburger was shortly comin g to Paris, and that he had therefore not been able t o frame his proposals more definitely.

It was further indicated that if the two states req uired the money at an earlier date, bankers could tempora rily advance the amount. Knowing of this term in the con - tract, Nathan had told his brothers at Frankfort im me- diately to advance money to Prussia and Russia. The se advances were actually made, so that at his intervi ew with Barbier, Rothschild was able proudly to inform him that his firm had advanced to the Russian court four mil lion gulden in cash and that his elder brother Solomon h ad gone to Berlin to carry through this important busi ness. A few days later Rothschild further informed Bar- bier, 36 with the object of impressing him, that his firm had received payments of the value of 750,000 franc s in English crowns, and that this amount could also be ap- plied to a settlement of the subsidies. In the meantime, Count Ugarte's reply to Barbier's communications of July 28 and August 1, in which Ba r- bier had first informed him of Rothschild's offers, was re- ceived. \"As your Excellency . . . quite rightly ob- serves,\" wrote the count, \"it will be more profitab le and safe for Austria in realizing the English subsidies to use native firms that enjoy the protection of her gover nment, than to have recourse to foreign firms, over which her government has no control, and in which one cannot have the confidence . . . necessary for such extensive o pera- tions, as one would have no control over their acti vities, and they would not be able to offer security for th e very considerable sums entrusted to them.\" Ugarte also e x- pressed the view that in any case it would appear m ore advantageous to discount the English bills at Vienn a, as the pound in that city was dealt in at nine gulden, three kreutzers, whereas, according to the latest report, it was only worth nine gulden at Frankfort. \"There can t here- fore be no question,\" he continued, \"of accepting t he firm"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"140 The Rise of the House of Rothschild of Rothschild's offer to take over twenty thousand pounds sterling at the price they have suggested, of 8.48 gulden.\" 37 The Rothschild proposal was therefore declined for the time being. Ugarte had failed to be convinced, and even Barbier had not been won over by the Brothers Roths - child. However, they did not lie down under this re - fusal. As they knew that the English government was working through Commissary-General Herries, on whom Nathan was bringing all his influence to bear, to get these financial transactions entrusted to them, they never thought of relaxing their efforts in that dir ection. Limburger had just arrived at Frankfort with new in - structions from England, and Amschel thereupon wrot e personally to Barbier: Most honored sir, gracious vice-president!

It merely provoked understanding smiles from the diplomats and highly placed persons with whom they had to deal. As Austria was not inclined to accept the Rothschil d offers, greater pressure had to be brought to bear by England, and it was decided accordingly to send Lim - burger to Vienna. 39 The statement that Carl Rothschild had made to Barbier, regarding his firm's financial deal- ings with Prussia and Russia, was in accordance wit h the facts. Herries had gone to Paris to carry through t he subsidy negotiations with the representatives of th e powers personally, and to convert them to Nathan's sys- tem under which the subsidy payments would not be e f- fected by drawing bills on London at considerable l oss to both parties, but through payments quietly carri ed through by the brothers Rothschild on the Continent .

He was careful to mention that he h ad already been entrusted with a similar transaction b y Rus- sia, and that 250,000 new Dutch Rand ducats which w ere destined for Russia had already been deposited with his firm. He brought a written application in support of his sug- gestion, and submitted to Barbier letters from the most important business firms in Paris, 40 from which it ap- peared that monetary conditions were so easy that t he bonds could be negotiated at a very desirable rate at that time. \"If you should be graciously pleased,\" the letter r an, \"to take advantage of these favorable circumstances , and to entrust us with the discounting of the bons roya ux belonging to the royal and imperial government, you shall have no cause to complain of the industry and care with which our brother who is living in Paris will carry through this business.

Rothschild imme- diately pledged himself to pay out any amount which he received in Brussels in francs, in thalers or good bills of exchange at Frankfort, after deducting one-half per cent commission. Barbier was entirely dependent on Vienna in such ma t- ters; he had first to report to Count Ugarte, and w ait for his decision. At that time, quite an interval had t o elapse before a reply could be received to a letter, and g overn- ment departments were also exceedingly slow in deal ing with correspondence.

This principle had paid, fo r by 1814 the Rothschilds were doing business that ran i nto millions. Barbier faithfully transmitted to Vienna all the of fers that were made to him, and received Ugarte's reply a month later. 44 This was not favorable to the foreign Jews, and showed a preference for relying on native bankers. He could not, however, entirely ignore Bar - bier's suggestion regarding the transfer of the mon ey from Brussels. He therefore wrote to say that he co n- sidered Rothschild's offer to be generally acceptab le, but limited the amount which they were to handle to abo ut one-half of the total; and in order to avoid all ri sk he instructed Barbier to arrange with the firm of Roth schild that the receipt for payment at the treasury in Bru ssels should not be handed to them until the sum had been paid in cash or in good Augsburg bills, or appropriate s ecur- ity had been furnished. Barbier hastened to arrange an interview with the f irm of Rothschild, and with the firm of Gontard, who we re collaborating with them, but he could not persuade them to agree to carry through the business on such term s. In spite of their desire to enter into relations with Austria, they wanted at least to have the advantage of being able to dispose of such a large sum for a short space of time, during which they could have employed it very profi tably within the scope of their numerous activities.

In spite of this new offensive in favor of the Hous e of Rothschild, the business was entrusted to Bethmann, on the ground that the property of that house was \"wel l known to be so great as to require no other securit y than a duly binding contract or a debenture.\" This was a triumph of Bethmann over Rothschild, and it was due to the fact that the importance and financial great ness of the firm of Rothschild, which at that time was s till of very recent date, was not appreciated at Vienna, an d even Barbier had more faith in the old Christian firm of Beth- mann than in the upstart Jewish firm.

Baron von Hugel's elaborate report 45 as to the way in which a sum of 8,353 gulden and 74 kreutzers could most safely and cheaply be sent from Frankfort to Vienna , makes strange reading today. At first he wanted to en- trust the amount to a non-commissioned officer who was leaving for the imperial city with a consignment of of- ficial documents; but on reflection he thought it w as too dangerous to entrust such a large sum to a soldier, as one could never tell what chance accidents might befall him on the way, and endanger the property confided to h im. After such pondering Hugel finally had recourse to the Rothschilds, and asked them whether they could not issue a bill on Vienna for the amount. The firm replied t hat they were prepared to issue such a document, and to make it a bill payable at sight, but that they would hav e to charge a commission of one per cent, a sum of 83.30 gulden, which sum was certainly less than the cost of sending the remittance by post-chaise. Such special cir- cumstances yielded opportunities of profit which th e Rothschild family most skilfully exploited by estab lish- ing a kind of clearing-house between the three brot hers in London, Paris, and Frankfort; and this system wa s soon extended to Vienna. Nathan was the father of this idea. Although the th ird son, he was more and more tending to become the dir ect- ing brain of the firm. His association with Herries , who relied upon him to an increasing extent, although c on- cealed from the public became increasingly intimate and more profitable both politically and financially. The services rendered by Nathan, not only covered an ex - tensive field, but were also most varied in their n ature.

When the Allies invaded France in 1814, he appealed to his divine right to the throne, and decided to go to Paris immediately after the fall of Napole on. However, he lacked the money necessary to undertake the journey and make his appearance in France with the magnificence proper to a king. The king applied to the English Treasury, requesting it to advance the nece s- sary capital. As French currency and bills on Paris were required, the application was sent to Herries to de al with, and he called in Nathan. Nathan was delighted to have such an early oppor- tunity of proving himself useful to Louis XVIII, an d with the assistance of his brother James in Paris h e ac- quired bills payable in that city, to the value of 200,000 English pounds. 46 He placed them speedily at the dis- posal of the new king, and thus made it possible fo r him to land at Calais on April 26, 1814, and to enter P aris on May 3.

His appearan ce, it is true, was not exactly prepossessing. He looke d very Jewish; he had red hair and deep-set eyes, and a go od complexion, but he had a wide mouth, a prominent hooked nose, and pursed-up lips. During his earlier years in Paris, he showed an almost servile politen ess to everyone. He had obviously acquired the habit at Fr ank- fort, where the status of the Jews was very low, bu t as he grew more successful and his position improved he g rad- ually lost it. Moreover, James was an exceedingly a cute, honorable, and clever banker, whose talents can be rated only a little below those of his brother Nathan. Ab ove all, he had a fair share of the other's abundant en ergy. In the life of feverish activity which developed in Paris after the conquest of that city, when officers, dip lomats, bankers, and business men flocked to it from all si des, James was absolutely in his element. He was seen every- where, in government offices as well as on the Bour se and in diplomatic circles, 47 and made great efforts to establish himself in society. He actively support ed Her- ries and his brother Nathan in their efforts to cas h the English subsidies without depressing the rate of ex change, and Nathan was able to show in a report to the Engl ish Treasury that hundreds of thousands were saved by t he new method. 48 Under the Paris Treaty of May 10, 1814, the French government had undertaken to meet certain obligatio ns incurred by responsible officials, either in France itself or in the conquered territories.

He had already decided ultimately to settle in Paris, just as Nathan had taken up permanent residence in England. He was, however, not in such a hurry as his brother to get naturalized, partly because he wanted to watch the course of developments in France after the stormy time of the revolution and the Napoleonic period; and since Fra nce could not at that time place any obstacles in the w ay of a subject of the victorious powers, he wanted to regi ster his own firm in Paris. If occasion should arise the pow ers were always ready to exert diplomatic pressure in f avor of their subjects. James did in fact register his b usiness without getting naturalized, his name appearing in the Paris trade almanac for 1814 as resident in the rue de Pelletier. Whilst the House of Rothschild was getting well est ab- lished in Western Europe through the activities of the two brothers, in its native town it had to fight fo r recogni- tion, owing to the aversion of the citizens to the Jews. The growing wealth of the Rothschild family at the ex- pense of Christian firms was viewed with displeasur e at Frankfort. Buderus had completely succeeded in eliminating their rivals. The firm of Van Notten at Am- sterdam had put up a fight longest, but that firm, also. failed to survive Buderus's systematic propaganda w ith the elector. In a letter dated May 13, 1814, Buderus had written to the electoral plenipotentiary Lorentz, at London , ex- pressing his dislike of that firm in the following words: 49 \"The worthy bankers Van Notten must be small-minded people.

The Frankfort Jews had nothing to fear from Austria and Prussia. When Grand Duke Dalberg left Frank- fort, the firm of Rothschild was a creditor of his for con- siderable sums, including the following items: 22,9 00 gulden for supplying flour to France; 71,181 gulden ad- vanced in connection with the transactions affectin g the Fulda property; and 50,000 gulden advanced to Dalbe rg On account of the Jewish tax commutation payment, which was not yet due. 50 Baron von Hugel, who after the occupation of Frankfort took part in its civil admin- istration, charged all these claims to the city bud get, on Amschel's application, to the great indignation of the senate. The city finances were in a state of confus ion, but the claims of the House of Rothschild seem to have been satisfied. The inhabitants of Frankfort particularly grudged t he Jews the equal political rights, which they had obt ained, it was held, by methods of indirect bribery. The threat- ened attitude of their native town caused the broth ers Rothschild to be seriously concerned about the futu re of the parent company on which their power was founded .

Moreover, the Rothschilds well knew the strict police control to which foreign Jews were subjected at Vienna, and how grea tly all Jews were restricted in their freedom to do bus iness in Austria. As they were determined, however, to se cure the desired business connections with the Austrian state, they were not tempted to make the realization of th eir plan more difficult through possible conflicts with the police authorities at Vienna. Such considerations caused the House of Rothschild to refrain from sending a member of the family ther e. The Frankfort Israelites sent old Bornes, Jacob Bar uch, and J. J. Gumprecht, as their representatives. They were closely watched by the Viennese police; indeed thei r ex- pulsion was ordered and sanctioned by the emperor h im- self; but Metternich intervened, and prevented this from being carried out. Metternich's intervention was pr ob- ably due to the fact that he had known Baruch when he was ambassador at Frankfort. There is no proof that Rothschild had any particular influence with the mi nis- ter at that time. The Jewish representatives at Vienna adopted the method of giving presents; thus they offered Humbol dt three magnificent emerald rings, or four thousand d ucats. —presents which he refused, whereas Gentz gladly al - lowed himself to be bribed. The brothers Rothschild had of course contributed to these funds; but they still kept quite in the background.

It was therefore again necessary to arrange to tran sfer the subsidy payments from England to the various co n- tinental powers, and substantial sums would have to be paid to Prussia and Austria. Prussia particularly w as again in great financial embarrassment, and unless this were immediately relieved, her future military acti on would suffer. Herries and Nathan now redoubled thei r feverish activities. Toward the end of April, Natha n sent in one instalment the sum of £200,000 to the P russian government. It was conveyed by Solomon, who travele d to Berlin for this purpose. When this amount proved inadequate, Solomon without previously consulting N a- than, granted a further advance of £150,000 on the secur- ity of the English subsidy, at a rate which was cer tainly very profitable to himself. Herries retrospectively sanctioned this operation. Not only did he make no objection, but he also allowed Eng- land to assume the considerable loss on exchange wh ich Solomon's high rate of profit had meant for the Pru ssian government. 52 His profit was not Solomon's only gain on this transaction; in return for his ready willin gness to advance such a heavy sum on his own responsibili ty, the Prussian government conferred on him the title of commercial adviser, a distinction that raised him a bove the majority of his rivals. Meanwhile in Austria a change had taken place in th e direction of the government's finances. Count Ugart e had retired, his place being taken by Count Stadion , the gifted and eminent statesman who was such a bitter op- ponent of Napoleon. Having hitherto been engaged ex - clusively in diplomatic matters, he had not as yet made himself familiar with finance. He therefore entered upon his new office with some misgivings.

In view of the change of atmosphere at Vi enna and the added prospect of new English subsidies, th e brothers Rothschild immediately made themselves fel t again, both indirectly through Herries and Limburge r, and by direct applications to the Austrian governme nt. However, Stadion as yet knew little about them, and as Nathan's heavy transactions were still purposely kept in the background, he had no information about thes e either, so that his whole knowledge regarding the o rigin and business of the House of Rothschild was exceedi ngly vague. He suddenly noticed that Meyer Amschel an d Sons described themselves as \"I. and R. Crown Agent s\" in a letter, and signed themselves as such. Stad ion in- quired at the Foreign Office about this from Metter nich - who had been advanced to the rank of prince after the battle of Leipzig—stating that he could not underst and their signing in this way, since the treasury had n o knowl- edge as to when and in what connection the Rothschi lds had acquired this title from the Austrian court.

In Frankfort, also, they met with every kind of opp o- sition. In order to hinder them in the development of their constantly increasing business, an attempt wa s made to force the two brothers who were living at Frankf ort into the army, in view of the special efforts being made to raise men to resist the return of Napoleon. They turned anxiously to Nathan for help, and he determi ned to use this opportunity of intervention for address ing a homily to Austria, as he realized that very definit e pres- sure would have to be brought to bear from England, if Austria were at last to be roped in as a customer. The House of Rothschild had already established a virtu al monopoly in carrying out the subsidy arrangements o f the Island Kingdom. Nathan went to Herries and acquainted him with the situation; and Herries induced the Foreign Office t o make representations to Herr von Neumann, Austrian counselor of embassy in London, in accordance with which Neumann commended the House of Rothschild to Baron von Hugel, the Austrian plenipotentiary at Frankfort. His letter ran as follows: 59 Sir: The English Government has requested me most particularly to commend to your Excellency's con- sideration the House of Rothschild at Frankfort, which carries out the transfer of our subsidies.

As the English government ap- pears to be most anxious that this firm should not be annoyed in any way, and as this appears to be a matter that directly concerns our service, I felt t hat I ought not to fail to transmit this request. I the re- fore ask your Excellency to grant that firm every help and protection that lies in your power. Baron von Hugel immediately forwarded this letter t o Vienna, where it was submitted to Metternich and St a- dion, and it did not fail of its effect. No further opposi- tion was offered to the Rothschild brothers' undert aking the transfer of the subsidies; and in general the i nterstate financial transactions were all carried through mor e eas- ily, since Stadion allowed his officials abroad muc h greater scope than had Ugarte. The new finance mini s- ter was inclined to leave more to their personal in itiative and judgment, as he realized that they being on the spot were in a better position to know what conditions w ere, and as the cumbrous methods of communication made i t impracticable to correspond on matters requiring an ini- media t e decision. At this time Hemes himself visited Frankfort, where his commissioner, Limburger, was negotiating with t he treasury commissioner Schwinner in regard to the amounts to be paid to Austria, which Stadion would have liked to receive in coin or bullion. Herries emph atically demanded that in this matter the House of Rothschil d should be granted as free a hand as possible, Napoleon's return had suddenly upset their plans an d made new measures necessary, and the commi ssary- general and Nathan were kept exceedingly busy.

As they could not obtain French coins anywhe re, Herries on Nathan's advice had gold louis minted, i n order to supply the armies. In the middle of June, Napoleon resumed the cam- paign. France was supporting him only half-heartedl y, for after all these wars everyone was longing for p eace, and was willing even to put up with foreign invasio n. Now, however, the French were faced again with a de - mand for new sacrifices and blood and treasure, and with a struggle against superior forces. For a short tim e the fortune of war seemed again to smile upon Napoleon, but as early as June 18, 1815, the Emperor of Franc e met his fate at Waterloo. He was completely and decisiv ely beaten—abdication, captivity, and banishment to St. Helena were the result. On the resumption of hostilities in France, Herries and Nathan had returned to London, and were anxiously awaiting news of the result of the conflict. Nathan and his brothers had always made a particular point of let- ting one another have news as speedily as possible, either directly or through their business friends, of any impor- tant event that might influence their business, or be a determining factor in new undertakings. Nathan had promised prizes for the most speedy supply of news to boats sailing between England and the Continent. He also instructed his agents throughout the world to give him the earliest possible report regarding the outc ome of the expected conflict. Such measures were of par tic- ular importance at that time, because none of the m odern methods of conveying news had been invented—the sta ge post, that is a series of messengers, being the usu al way of obtaining it quickly. Nathan's arrangements worked perfectly for the batt le of Waterloo. One of his agents, whose name was Roth - worth, waited at Ostend for news of the result. He suc- ceeded in obtaining the first newspaper account of the successful issue of the battle, and with a copy of the"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"The Great Napoleonic Crisis 159 Dutch Gazette fresh from the printers, he caught a boat just sailing for London. He entered the British cap ital very early in the morning of June 20, and immediate ly reported to Nathan, who conveyed the news of victor y to Herries, and through him to the British government. The government were at first skeptical, as they had not received any direct information, and Wellington's e n- voy Major Henry Percy did not arrive with the field - marshal's report until the 21st of June. 60 The members of the British government were tremendously impress ed by Nathan's advance knowledge of such an important event; and when this became generally known, the pu b- lic, who were just beginning to learn of the extent to which Nathan was employed by the English Treasury, began to invent all manner of legends regarding the method by which Nathan had acquired this knowledge and the manner in which he had exploited it. Some said that he had a private service of carrier- pigeons; others that he had been personally present at the battle of Waterloo and had ridden to the coast at t op speed. In order to make the story more romantic, he was said to have found heavy storms raging when he reac hed the Channel and to have crossed at the risk of his life. Nathan was also alleged to have exploited the news on the stock exchange, thus at one stroke creating the enor- mous fortunes of the Rothschilds. Nathan naturally applied the early information that he had obtained to his own profit in his business d eal- ings; but the substantial part of the fortune of th e Roths- childs had been amassed through the profits realize d in the financial transactions which have already been de- scribed; the successful issue of the battle of Wate rloo merely served to increase it, and to open up wider fields for profitable business in the future. This was a ll the more so as England had been victorious and Nathan h ad t r a n s f e r r e d the center of gravity of the Rothschild busi- ness to her side."},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"l6o The Rise of the House of Rothschild In spite of the fortunate issue of the campaign, wh ich had lasted barely six days, England continued to pa y the subsidies to the continental powers. The House of Rothschild was, for instance, instructed by the Eng lish Treasury—that is, by Hemes and Nathan—to pay Austria £277,777 on demand, for the months of Augus t and September, this amount not to be subject to any dis- count, so that Austria should receive it in full. 61 The commission due to the brothers Rothschild was paid by England herself. The payments were continued up to and including December. Stadion had expressed the wish that as much coin as pos- sible be sent. This made the transfer more difficul t and produced a fall in the exchange; it was due to the con- tinuing distrust, which even Schwinner, Austria's r epre- sentative at Frankfort, was not able to dissipate. The English alone emphatically countered this attitude, and the resulting correspondence clearly shows how high ly the wealth and position of the young firm of Rothsc hild were already rated in England, or at any rate in th e au- thoritative circles of Commissary-General Herries, as compared to their standing in Austria. \"The . . . exchange value [of the pound],\" wrote Schwinner to the Austrian embassy in London in Nove m- ber, 1815, \"was constantly rising during the early part of November; after the 9th it weakened because Roth s- child, having reason to believe that Austria would insist on receiving her considerable payments in cash, ref rained from purchasing bills offered by foreigners.

I con- sidered that this condition was met when Baron von Limburger gave a written undertaking on behalf of t he English government that that government would in an y case indemnify the imperial and royal treasury if a ny loss whatever were suffered in realizing the bills accep ted by Rothschild.\" 62 Schwinner had on a previous occasion expressed his misgivings to Limburger regarding his responsibilit y for any loss \"resulting from the lack of solidity of th e firm of Rothschild.\" Limburger had on that occasion repl ied to him in the following terms: \"I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of you r v a l u e d communication of even date.

As they were both hearin g such completely satisfactory accounts of the firm o f Roths- child from all quarters, and more particularly were learning of the enormous credit which that firm enj oyed, confidence was completely established at Vienna. Fr om now onwards the firm of Rothschild was most extensi vely employed by Austria, even in business which had not h- ing whatever to do with the English subsidy. Thus Nathan had succeeded, while remaining behind the scenes himself, in establishing his brothers on the Continent in the confidence of the Austrian Treasur y. This was to be the starting-point of an even more i nti- mate association with governing circles in the impe rial state, which was to develop within the next few yea rs. While the position of the Rothschild family abroad became more and more important and their wealth at- tained prodigious dimensions by reason of the great in- terstate financial transactions which were entruste d to them, they had to fight in their native town of Fra nkfort to secure the equal political rights of the Jews wh ich had been granted during the period of French dominion. In spite of the decisions of the Congress of Vienna an d in spite of Metternich and Hardenberg, this equality w as threatened by a hostile senate. Now, however, embol d- ened by the position which they had won with the gr eat powers, the brothers Rothschild felt in a position to make more definite efforts on behalf of their fellows. The newly created Federal Diet which met at Frank- fort had an important voice in this matter, and the Roths- childs determined to gain the responsible represent atives of the powers for their cause.

On October 17, 1816, he had nominated, as his envoy to the German Federal Diet, the administrator of hi s financial affairs, the old supporter of the Rothsch ild fam- ily, Buderus von Carlshausen—who in the meantime ha d advanced to the dignity of privy councilor and pres ident of the Chamber. Von Carlshausen had recently been i n Paris, on business in connection with his master's claims for compensation, and had specially commended the e lec- tor's interests to James. He was now to serve as a kind of liaison officer between the elector and the Hous e of Rothschild, as indeed he had always been. Only posi - tions were now somewhat changed; hitherto it had be en the Rothschilds who had asked favors; now it was th e elector and Buderus who tried to maintain a close c on- nection.

The Jews did not wish to pay the money until it was certain that the rights which they were thus purchasing would be sec ured to them.

Both the persons appealed to agreed; a nd Hardenberg wrote to Metternich that he considered t he request to be right and just, that the city of Fran kfort could not legally raise any objection, and that it would be advisable for the two courts jointly and emphati cally to enjoin Frankfort to recognize the agreement as b ind- ing and to fulfil it. 66 Count Buol-Schauenstein, Austria's plenipotent iary, and therefore president of the Federal Diet, was, i n con- trast to his superior Metternich, no friend of the Jews, and had reported his views to Metternich at Vienna. He held that Grand Duke Dalberg had sold the rights of citizenship to a crowd of Jewish families for a son g. \"Trade,\" wrote the ambassador from Frankfort, \"is still the only means of livelihood which the Jews a dopt. This nation, which never amalgamates with any other , but always hangs together to pursue its own ends, w ill soon overshadow Christian firms; and with their ter ribly rapid increase of population they will soon spread over the whole city, so that a Jewish trading city will gradu- ally arise beside our venerable cathedral.\" 67 "},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"166 The Rise of the House of Rothschild Buol's attitude was bound eventually to result in a con- flict of opinion with Metternich, but for the time being no decision was made in the Jewish question, and th e question of the status at Frankfort remained in the balance. Paris offered opportunities of important new busine ss, and all the members of the Rothschild family were k ept fully occupied exploiting them as far as possible. The victorious powers inflicted a heavy war indem- nity on France, appointing four commissioners of th e principal powers to settle the precise terms and re ceive the money. They met at Paris under the presidency o f the Austrian, Baron von Barbier. The amount of the indemnity was fixed at seven hundred million francs , to be paid within five years in fifteen instalments of 46,666,- 666 francs, commencing on December 1, 1815. At once the difficulty arose of arranging for these pay- ments to be transmitted to the powers. James, perce iving the great possibilities of profit that the situatio n offered, advised his brothers and urged them to do everythin g pos- sible to get the order for remitting this French tr ibute. The brothers had to meet heavy competition. Austria still employed her four banking firms, which were r epre- sented in Paris; while Baring and other big firms i n England endeavored, in connection with the Paris ba nk- ing firm of Ouvrard, to get the business. All the f irms were eager to exploit the opportunity to the utmost , and all the financial and banking world was considering the methods by which the great indemnity could be settl ed.

The four Vien nese"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"The Great Napoleonic Crisis 167 firms had very poor connections in Germany, and it was not practicable to make use of them. The question therefore was whether the Messageries —the overland postal services—could be entrusted wi th this task, or whether recourse should be had to ban kers as an intermediary. Barbier felt anxious about the first method, the roads being exceedingly unsafe so soon after the confusion of the war. This was indicated by the fact that the postal company refused to accept liability for \"les vols a main armee,\" after a mail-bag had been rifled on another journey. Barbier reported as follows to Stadion: 69 \"I am in- formed that the Frankfort bankers Rothschild and Go n- tard have undertaken entirely at their own risk to trans- fer certain sums of money required for the Wurttemb erg regiments that are remaining in France, and that th ey have been granted a commission of one and a half pe r cent for their services. This amounts to exactly doubl e the transport costs demanded by the Messageries. I h ave also heard that they have demanded one and a quarte r per cent for sending money to the Russian regiments . I suggested to them that they should remit our money at their own risk for a commission of one per cent, to cover all expenses; but they definitely stated that the e xpense and the danger were too great for this commission t o cover them. I had therefore no alternative, after lengthy negotiations with them, except either to grant the colli- mission they asked or to adopt the cheaper but some what unsafe method of sending the money by the Messageri es.\" The Messageries were certainly cheaper, but an acci - dent to a single remittance might make this manner of transport exceedingly expensive. Barbier therefore closed with the firms of Rothschild and Gontard, an d on Janua r y 6, 1816, they dispatched the final letter r egard- ing the transfer of the first amount of 2,200,000 f rancs to Colmar. \"Allow us,\" they wrote, 70 \"to add the assurance that"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"168 The Rise of the House of Rothschild we shall apply our united efforts to carrying out t his to your complete satisfaction. . . . We could not offe r a lower commission because we cannot yet accurately e sti- mate the expenses involved. We shall, however, make it our duty to reduce this commission in the case o f future remittances if circumstances permit. We venture to trust that your Excellency will be disposed to let us kno w when future payments have to be made, in order that we may be able to quote you the cheapest terms.\" Accepting responsibility for all risks of carriage, the two firms undertook the transfer of these moneys fr om Paris to Colmar for a commission of one and a quart er per cent on the payments made. This was not so seri ous for them as it might appear, since they did not rea lly transfer any money at all, but through their extens ive connections acquired the equivalent sum at the plac e of payment itself. Thus without incurring any risk, th ey were able to book the high commission as pure profi t. After this system had been in force for some time, the general commanding at Colmar, Baron Frimont, who re - garded the commission as excessive, intervened, and at- tempted to get the money over by military couriers. How- ever, after trying to do this for two months, he ad mitted himself beaten, and himself requested 71 that these remit- tances and the issue of officers' pay should again be car- ried out by the firms of Rothschild and Gontard, \"a s has already been found to be the most reliable method i n con- nection with military payments at Frankfort.\" They did not confine themselves to this business.

Competition was ex- ceedingly keen. At last the brothers Rothschild succeeded in winnin g over Barbier, Austria's financial representative in Paris, whose attitude toward them had hitherto been neutra l. As time went on he became an ardent supporter of th e Rothschild family and of the Frankfort bankers who were working in conjunction with them. This is revealed by the correspondence which passed between him and Cou nt Stadion, who dealt with the matter in a thoroughly busi- nesslike and impartial manner. Stadion recognized the conscientious services rende red by the Rothschilds in remitting the subsidies; and Na- than saw that the minister was fully informed from Eng- land of the part which they had played. With Napole on a captive at St. Helena, the period of subsidy paym ents was completely at an end, so it was no longer neces sary to keep this business a strict secret. Nor did Nath an consider it desirable to do so, since their credit and repu- t a t i o n would gain if it were widely known that thos e enormous sums had been handled by the House of Roth s- child. We must bear in mind that during the period between October, 1811, and October, 1816, no less than £42, 500,- 000 73 had passed through Herries's hands. Almost half. of this had been forwarded to the various continent al recipients through the intermediary of Nathan and h is brothers. In Herries's memoirs, published by his so n, are extracts from a memorandum 74 prepared for compe- tent authorities, which speaks of Rothschild in the high- est terms. Of course in praising Rothschild, Herrie s was indirectly taking credit for himself, since he afte r all was responsible, and would have had to bear the bla me for any mistakes. Herries wrote that it was possibly solely due to th e banking firm of Mr. Rothschild and his brothers tha t he had been enabled to carry through the exchange oper a-"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"170 The Rise of the House of Rothschild tions so successfully. He said that the greatest gr ati- tude was owing to these gentlemen, who had devoted themselves entirely to the public service, and that the re- ward which they would receive would have been fairl y and honorably won. Herries certainly emphasized 75 the fact that he had al- ways kept Nathan strictly under his control, had ne ver allowed him to take any steps without his express c on- sent, and had had him almost constantly with him in his room; but he also stated in a private letter to the chancel- lor of the exchequer that he owed it to Mr. Rothsch ild not to miss this opportunity of bearing witness to the skill and energy with which he had carried out this servi ce, quite unobtrusively and in such a manner that the r ate of exchange had not been unfavorably affected. Even if we regard Herries's testimony as biased, there c an be no doubt that Nathan rendered magnificent financial services, from which, it is true, he personally rea ped sub- stantial profits. The Austrian finance minister Count Stadion was jus t about to undertake the task of putting his country' s finances thoroughly in order, reducing the amount o f paper money in circulation, and as far as possible reduc- ing Austria's public debt. He required a large amou nt of ready money for these purposes. This he had the pros- pect of obtaining through the Austrian share of the French indemnity, but as the payments were distribu ted in instalments over a period of years, and as he re quired money urgently, he decided that he would try to obt ain an advance on the amount due. He therefore wrote from Milan 76 to Barbier in Paris: \"If your Excellency should receive any offers of an ad- vance on the security of the contributions due in t he next few years, I am of opinion that they should be cons idered, for they would assure us the advantage of obtaining a certain sum for the treasury at an early date.\" Barbier replied to his minister as follows:"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"The Great Napoleonic Crisis 171 As such an offer could be expected to be made only by a very substantial banking company, I con- trived to introduce the subject in the course of co nver- sation with the firm of Rothschild.

I asked him to put his suggestio n in writing; but he replied that he was unable to do so until a commissioner had been definitely in- structed by Austria to enter into such negotiations . This is as far as matters have gone at present; and I am led to infer that the proposal is at present merely a tentative suggestion on the part of Roths- child, who would try to find partners for the schem e if our court would express an opinion in favor of i t. . . . Rothschild spoke of the enormous discount of forty per cent. Barbier emphasized the fact that the entrepreneurs were speculating on an enormous profit and that Rot hs- child was paving the way thereto by mentioning this heavy discount. Barbier estimated the loss involved through such advance payments at \"only\" about twent y percent. He stated that it would require special con- siderations to make it desirable to incur a loss ex ceeding twenty percent. It is true that the demands put forward by the Roth s- childs were extremely high, and the benefit to be d erived from such a transaction was positively enormous. But the very offer, implying as it did that the brother s Roths- child and their business friends were in a position imme- diately to supply cash to the tune of countless mil lions of fran cs, shows how strong the financial position of the Rothschilds had now become.

Austria's urgent need of money, and the hope of get ting better terms for the advances from the brothers Rot hs- child inspired Stadion to a clever move. He would p ut the family, who, handicapped by their origin, were mak- ing every effort to improve their social position, under a special obligation. After the conclusion of the sub sidy transactions, the Rothschilds had repeatedly appeal ed to Baron von Handel and to Schwinner at Frankfort to r ec- ommend to the emperor recognition of their services ; and Schwinner had forwarded this request to Count Stadion, the minister of finance. Stadion gladly av ailed himself of the opportunity thus offered. Of the subsidies amounting to approximately £1,800, 000 (15,000,000 gulden) 77 which were made available in the year 1815, the four Viennese discount houses first dis- counted an amount of about 2,750,000 gulden, for wh ich the Austrian government paid a commission of one pe r- cent. The money, however, was not forthcoming as speedily as had been hoped, and the Austrian govern ment was compelled to ask the four banking firms for adv ances on the payments. On these they had to pay interest at the rate of six percent. They were therefore exceedingl y pleased when the English government consented to ma ke the moneys payable in large amounts and even to pay sev- eral months' instalments in advance through the fir m of Rothschild. Thus Austria no longer had to pay any commission, and thereby saved one percent in that r e- spect, as well as saving six percent on any advance s. In the finance minister's report to Emperor Francis the following passage occurred: 78 Count Stadion flatters himself that his Majesty will approve of the manner in which this business was carried through. In this connection he feels it to be his duty to recommend that the services of th e Frankfort banking firm Meyer Amschel Rothschild"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"The Great Napoleonic Crisis 173 and Sons should be recognized, since the efforts of that firm contributed in a special degree to securi ng the prompt payment of the English subsidy moneys, and in the present circumstances it may be necessar y to have further recourse to the good offices of tha t firm. . . . The firm has very large resources and e n- joys an even larger credit. It can carry through transactions that appear vast to a private person o n the Continent, because the British government em- ploys it in the most extensive operations and there - fore supports it with the necessary funds. An examination of the subsidy transactions reveals the fact that the House of Rothschild alone paid ou t 12,203,822.43 florins with respect to £1,442,000. T he report of the former high commissioner, who was in charge of the subsidy payments at Frankfort at the time, shows that Rothschild always paid most punc- tually, and that on various occasions, such as in changing foreign coin and bills, he showed the greatest desire to help without taking any undue advantage. After the subsidy transactions had been carried through, the head of the firm expressed a wish that the services which he rendered might be publicly recognized by your Majesty. High Commissioner Schwinner was asked for his opinion as to the form which such recognition should take. He discussed the matter with the director of the Gratz police, Gohausen, who was then at Frankfort. . . . Gohau- sen suggested that the head of the house should be granted the honorary title of imperial and royal councilor, a like title having been granted for sim - ilar reasons to the brothers Kaula, in Hanau and Stuttgart, and to other Israelites.

He favors the granting of an imperial title of nobility, believing the apprehen- sions of the director of police to be unfounded. Since then Rothschild has repeatedly asked for some recognition as an encouragement both to himself and to others. Count Stadion begs to state by way of recapitula- tion: The services rendered by Rothschild are not o f a kind that may be suitably rewarded by conferring an order; but the civilian medal would hardly come up to his expectations. In view of his own wealth, a reward in money or money's worth would be even less appropriate. And such in any case would have to bear some relation to the high dignity of the do nor and would therefore have to be very considerable. In the opinion of Count Stadion orders are more sui t- able as a reward for officials, but as Rothschild h as already many officials under his direction, an orde r is not likely to impress him. Count Stadion there- fore requests that as a public mark of your Majesty 's satisfaction with the services rendered by the Fran k- fort firm Meyer Amschel Rothschild and Sons, your Majesty will graciously confer on the two brothers of this firm resident here, the German hereditary title of nobility, free of all dues, and will autho rize him, Count Stadion, to convey to the firm in a spec ial letter your Majesty's satisfaction.

He regarded them simply as a ca l- culating family of money-makers who were only con- cerned with their own interests, and he accordingly sent in a detailed report in which he argued against gra nting them a title of nobility. At the beginning of his s tate- ment Lederer gave a short synopsis 79 of the movements of the pound sterling before and after the battle of W ater- loo, based upon the payments actually made by the R oths- childs.

In this connection two questions hav e to be considered: 1. In this business, have they co n- ferred a benefit on the Austrian Treasury, and wherein does this benefit lie? 2. How can this ben- efit be suitably recognized? As to the first, it was not until June, 1815, that the firm of Rothschild was employed as the business agent of the English government, in connection with the realization of the subsidies. It looked after t he payments for that government, for which service it no doubt received a liberal commission, its duty being to maintain the rate of exchange between Eng- land and the Continent in favor of England and to"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"176 The Rise of the House of Rothschild improve it. The firm of Rothschild never had any right to ask Austria for a commission on the pay- ments which it was effecting on behalf of the Engli sh government. In acting wisely in this matter, it de- served the compliments of the English government, whose intentions it was carrying out. The rate of exchange at which funds were transmitted before and after the battle of Waterloo indicates how far its success was due to fortunate circumstances and how far to its efforts. In effecting the payments accu- rately and punctually, the firm of Rothschild was b ut doing its duty. Even the fact brought forward by Schwinner, that they made the payments to the gov- ernor-general at Frankfort and to his military de- partments—payments for which the Austrian Treas- ury was responsible—out of the subsidy moneys, without charging any special commission for these transactions, cannot in my opinion be counted very much to its credit. It was paid a commission on the whole amount by England, and it cannot have been any more trouble to the firm to divide the payments among the various departments than to pay the whole amount into the central treasury at Frankfort. In any case I cannot conceive of a business firm doing business except in its own interest. The business m an undertakes transactions in order to make a profit, and he should not pretend to having conferred an obligation where he has not done so. Count Stadion thinks it desirable to secure the good-will of a firm of such extensive credit with a view to the future. I must confess that I cannot se e how this is to be obtained by conferring any distin c- tion whatever on the House of Rothschild. They will carry through transactions for the Austrian financial administration again in the future.

However, since the firm of Rothschild has carried through such considerable financial transactions fo r the Austrian Treasury, whereby the payment of com- mission was saved, I consider that it would be prop er and consonant with your Majesty's dignity to give both brothers Rothschild a proof of your favor. In this connection I cannot agree with the sug- gestion that a hereditary title should be conferred . Such titles should be the reward of service only. In this case there is the special consideration tha t the brothers Rothschild are Israelites. It is true that there have been cases in which your Majesty has decided to raise Israelites to the ranks of Austria n nobility, e.g., Baron Arnsteiner and Ritter von Eskeles. On the other hand the claims of the Frankfort Jews to full rights of citizenship are now the subj ect of discussion, and although I would not venture to express an opinion as to whether honors should be conferred upon Jewish business men when the result of the negotiations in the diet is pending, I sugge st that if your Majesty is inclined to act upon Count Stadion's proposal, the views of the minister for foreign affairs should first be ascertained. Person - ally I consider that the most suitable thing would be that your Majesty should make a gift to each of the two brothers Rothschild of a gold snuff-box bear- ing your Majesty's monogram in diamonds. Count Stadion might be consulted as to the monetary value of such a gift. Count Zichy, to whom this memorandum was sub- mitted for his observations, sent it on to the empe ror with the comment that he considered Baron von Lederer's ar- gument to be sound but that he could not immediatel y agree that the proposal should be rejected.

Metternich reported verbally t o Emperor Francis in favor of ennobling the Rothschil d family. Mindful of the important financial and political co n- siderations on which Stadion's proposal was based, and which were further emphasized by Metternich, the em - peror agreed, although he felt that the minor nobil ity would view the ennoblement of foreign Jews with ver y mixed feelings. The patent conferring the title of no- bility on Amschel and Solomon, in recognition of th eir services in realizing the English subsidies, was is sued from Schonbrunn on September 25, 1816. 82 Meanwhile, it had been pointed out to Stadion that the two other brothers, Carl and James, whose services were also required for the operations that were being pl anned, might feel slighted, and a few days later Stadion r ecom- mended that these two brothers should also be ennob led. Emperor Francis issued an order in council to this ef- fect, dated October 21, 1816. 83 No sooner had the document been signed than Ugarte had the fact recorded in the official Vienna papers . Stadion expressly thanked the chancellor for doing so; a fact indicating the importance which he attached to the whole matter. At the same time he informed Ugarte t hat he had asked both the brothers Rothschild to submit a de-"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"The Great Napoleonic Crisis 179 sign for a coat-of-arms, and to state whether they wished to adopt a prefix of nobility. 84 Stadion had informed Ugarte of the reasons for con- ferring a title of nobility, as set out in his repo rt to the emperor, and added: \"I do not consider, however, th at the patent should enter into any details as to the services rendered, but that there should be merely a general state- ment to the effect that since the two brothers Meye r Am- schel [sic] Rothschild and Solomon Meyer Rothschild have carried through a loan most meticulously and p unc- tually—the English subsidy transactions during the year 1815—and have also shown an exceptional readiness t o render services outside their actual duties, his Ma jesty has been most graciously moved, etc., etc.\" In accordance with Stadion's request, the brothers Rothschild submitted a design for a coat-of-arms. T his was enclosed with a letter written by Solomon Roths - child's own hand, 85 explaining the design, and reading as follows: \"First quarter, or, an eagle sable surchar ged in dexter by a field gules (having reference to the Im perial and Royal Austrian Coat-of-Arms) ; second quarter, gules, a leopard passant proper (a reference to the Eng- lish Royal Coat-of-Arms) ; third quarter, a lion ra mpant (with reference to the Hessian Electoral Coat) ; fo urth quarter, azure, an arm bearing five arrows (a symbo l of the unity of the five brothers). \"In the center of the coat a shield gules.

We must remember that at that period the higher nobility were dominant in almost all the sta tes of Europe. They occupied all the highest positions in the state and were in a most favored position finan cially as compared with other citizens. For a Jewish famil y who had to fight hard for their position in their n ative city, the Rothschilds' imperial patent was a partic ularly rare distinction, and involved an important step fo rward in their fight for social recognition. As soon as t he no- bi l i t y had recovered somewhat from their annoyance, it became much easier for the brothers Rothschild to m ake their way socially. The event was naturally very helpful to the relatio ns of the House of Rothschild with Austrian statesmen.

Simi lar advances on account of the French contribution appe ar to have been suggested to Prussia and Russia, and i n February, 1817, a loan of several millions was made to Prussia in the name of Rothschild. The Elector of Hesse, it is true, had a large share in this. 92 The brothers Rothschild still carried out really big transaction s in conjunction with their patron or with other firms, but the time was soon to come when the five brothers would act alone, and one great firm after another would fall before them.

In Austria their per- sistence had met with the greatest measure of succe ss, and accordingly they redoubled their efforts in tha t coun- try to secure new honors and titles. It did not tak e them long to realize that friendly social relations were of the greatest use to them in their business in each coun try; but it was just in this matter that they often met with great difficulties in London and Paris. It was exceedingly hard for poorly educated German emigrant Jews to get into the higher social circles , even though they were rich. James had so far been most s uc- cessful; at the excellent dinners which he gave he was already entertaining diplomats such as the Austrian am- bassador Baron Vincent, and once even a prince of t he blood royal, Paul von Wurttemberg.

The convulsions through which all the states of Europe had passed, and the enormous military eff orts made during the preceding quarter of a century, had pro- duced general confusion in their finances, which co uld be straightened out only by hard work in peace cond itions. Every state had been spending money lavishly for a long time, and the resulting shortage of money was very acute. The poverty-struck states had to acquire the cash necessary for their recovery from those who had suc - ceeded in profiting by war conditions to accumulate riches as contractors or through financial operations. For e- most among these was the House of Rothschild, and i t gladly lent money to princes and states, as the rep ayment of such loans through their subjects was secured. Thus it advanced moneys to numerous small princely famil ies, especially to those of the neighborhood, while its relations with the Elector of Hesse remained outwardly unchan ged.

Nathan was not in the least inclined to rest upon his laurels, or to limi t him- self to the preservation and enjoyment of the famil y's great fortune. His aim was to increase the power of his House; and he held the view that in order to win a vic- tory, ducats, like soldiers, had to be concentrated in mass suddenly and unexpectedly upon a wisely selected po int. 1 This was the dominant note in the policy of his Hou se during the following period. In order to apply this policy it was necessary, now that his firm enjoyed the high regard of the business co m- munity, that he should secure his position in socie ty as well. The Austrian patent of nobility had given him a good start in this direction; but his native city a nd the senate of Frankfort continued to adopt an unfriendl y at- titude toward the Jews, including the Rothschild fa mily. Amschel at Frankfort, who had been placed in charge of the campaign against the senate, used every oppo rtu- nity for exerting external pressure upon the author ities of the city, especially through Prussia and Austria . At the beginning of the year 1818 a favorable opportun ity occurred for again enlisting the support of the Pru ssian Chancellor Prince Hardenberg, who was well disposed toward the Jews. The state finances of Prussia were, like those of A ustria, in great confusion. The deficit was large, and it s eemed not improbable that the pay of civil servants and o f the army would have to be suspended. The treasury lived , from hand to mouth, and the king himself was being dunned by small tradesmen. In these circumstances, Barandon, the London representative of the Prussian Mercantile Marine, had recommended that a loan shou ld be raised in England, and that for this purpose rec ourse should be had to Nathan Rothschild.

The monarch told him the measures he coul d apply if action were taken by the magistracy of Fra nk- fort, but at the same time expressed the desire tha t the wishes of the magistracy should be met as far as po s- sible. \"In any case,\" the resolution concluded, \"I do not wish Prussia to support the Jews in the diet.\" 3 On this Hardenberg angrily commented: \"First ad acta. We have at any rate the decisions of the Cong ress of Vienna to go upon.\" 4 However, the king came off his high horse, for Hard en- berg had made him realize that the Prussian state w ould need the brothers Rothschild for a loan, and that i t would not be good policy for Prussia to alienate them by an at- titude unfriendly to the Jews in the Diet of Frankf ort.

Amschel regarded the head of the House of Bethmann, which was being more and more overshadowed by the Rothschilds, as a natural enemy of the Jews; but Be th- mann refused to admit that this was so. \"If Herr Ja mes,\" he wrote at the time to David Parish, \"will but vis it me at Frankfort, he will soon realize that I am not in fluenced by any nonsense about Christians and that I have no prejudice against a reputable Jew. I have often at- tempted in vain to disabuse Amschel of the stupid i llusion that I am opposed to the demands of the Jewish comm u- nity at Frankfort in so far as they are reasonable. The fact that I am suspected by my fellow Christians of tak- ing the Jewish side should convince him, if nothing else will, that he has no ground for his attitude.\" 5 Amschel Meyer certainly was greatly interested in keeping on good terms with Prussia and Austria. Pru ssia's acute financial distress seemed to provide a furthe r ex- cellent opportunity of earning a large amount of mo ney, and he did all he could, in close collaboration wit h his brother Nathan in London, to induce Prussia to come to the Rothschilds for refuge. That kingdom had very good reason to look around fo r money, for in 1817 the state was carrying a burden of twenty millions of floating debt, interest being ch arged on part of this amount at the extravagant rate of t wenty percent per annum, the payments being met by furthe r borrowings each year. 6 Apart from this, the annual budget showed a deficit of several million thalers.

As Prussian commissioner of finance he had already com e into contact with the House of Rothschild in Paris, and he now succeeded in getting on exceedingly good ter ms with Amschel Meyer. Amschel referred him to his brother Nathan in Lon- don, as the most likely person to make the loan a s uccess. Hitherto, Barandon had conducted the negotiations i n England, but he was not liked by the House of Roths - child. Rother, on the other hand, the brothers had known in Paris, and they regarded him as a more pleas- ant person to deal with. Indeed they preferred him in every way, and were exceedingly gratified when he c ame; to London and Barandon was left out in the cold. They were now dealing only with two friends of thei r House, Rother and the Prussian ambassador in London , William von Humboldt, the brother of the great expl orer Alexander. He himself was not only a diplomat, but also a distinguished scholar and philosopher. Humbo ldt understood little of money matters, and he left his pri- vate estate to be managed by Rothschild, whereas Ro ther was regarded as a financial genius in his own count ry. Humboldt was certainly a complete believer in Natha n Rothschild's indisputably superior talent for finan ce. He reported in this sense to Berlin, using words which are especially remarkable coming from such a man. \"If the loan is to succeed here,\" his report ran, \" this can be managed in my opinion only through Rothschil d."},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"192 The Rise of the House of Rothschild . . .

He is also, as far as I know , just, exceedingly honest, and intelligent. But I must add that if business is given to him to carry out, it will b e neces- sary to fall in with his ideas. For he has acquired the independent habit of mind developed by riches and a fairly long sojourn in this country, and he is now en- gaged in such a constant number of financial transa ctions that it will not greatly affect him if one of them fails to come his way. He wants to take over the whole loan himself; on this point he is likely to be exceeding ly firm, and he has asked in advance that the Prussian consu l here, against whom he is prejudiced, shall not be a llowed to interfere in the matter in any way.\" 8 Humboldt's report is all the more valuable as an ex - pression of opinion, since he proved his independen ce in concluding it by advising against the acceptance of the loan, this being of course quite contrary to Nathan 's wishes. Rother, on the other hand, speedily came to terms with Nathan regarding a loan of five million pounds. This he considered advantageous for Prussia , as other important states were able to obtain money by loan only in small amounts. 9 In spite of the ups and downs of the negotiations, exceedingly cordial rela tions seem to have been maintained throughout between Rother and Rothschild. At any rate this is indicate d by their correspondence at this time. Rother wrote to Solomon Rothschild, 10 who was also in London at the time, that he had been glad to make the closer acqu ain- tance of his brother Nathan, whose character and in telli- gence he felt compelled the greatest admiration.

Rother was delighted that he had carried the business through and that on the day on which the agreement was conclude d Nathan sent a ship to Hamburg with a million thaler s as a payment on account. Rother had, if possible, been even more strongly im - pressed than William von Humboldt by Nathan's influ - ence. \"The Rothschild in this country,\" he reported to Berlin, 10 \"is a most estimable person and has an incredible influence upon all financial affairs here in London . It is widely stated, and is indeed almost a fact that he en- tirely regulates the rate of exchange in the city. His power as a banker is enormous.\" The loan, which was issued at an average price of 7 2 per cent, turned out to be \"a splendid piece of bus iness\" for Rothschild, as it never fell below the price of issue, and in 1824 actually reached par. The House of Roth s- child therefore had every occasion to be pleased wi th this, the first big state loan which they handled, and they were encouraged to develop this line of business on a large scale. This loan was the first of several. The brothers had formed valuable friendships throug h these negotiations, and William von Humboldt intro- duced them to his famous brother Alexander. It was not long before he was seen dining at Rothschild's house in London. Nathan was more frequently the guest of William von Humboldt, whose wide education and ex- tensive knowledge certainly provided a contrast to the Frankforter who had risen so rapidly. Humboldt ex- pressed himself candidly about him in a letter to h is wife. \"Yesterday,\" the letter runs, \"Rothschild dined wit h me.

'Well,' said Rothschild, 'if they had not all died, major, you would presumably still be a su bal- tern.' You ought to have seen Martins's face.\" The Rothschilds were anxious to maintain their friendly relations with the Humboldt brothers. Solo mon also did his best to be agreeable to them whenever pos- sible. Meeting Caroline von Humboldt at Carlsbad on one occasion, he overwhelmed her with attentions. S he wrote to her husband: \"I have had several callers, and among others Herr von Rothschild, the brother of th e one who is looking after your affairs at Frankfort. He made some exceedingly comic remarks to me. He thanked me, in the course of his conversation, for receiv- ing him, and said, 'Your Excellency ought to come t o Frankfort again. We could do with a lady like you there.' It sounded extraordinarily funny. He also a sked me whether he could be of use to me in the matter o f money and said that his purse was at my disposal.\" 11 The Prussian loan, which the brothers Humboldt ar- ranged with the Rothschilds, furnished another exce llent illustration of the way in which the three brothers worked together. While Solomon and Nathan were dealing with that business in London, Amschel Meyer was meeting an aw k- ward situation at Frankfort. In the case of proposi tions which the firm did not like, they could excuse them - selves by pointing out the difficulty of obtaining the agree- ment of all the brothers—that is, of five persons w ho usually were widely separated from one another—this agreement being necessary for any substantial trans - action.

In contrast to his parsimon ious father, the crown prince had made himself popular b y a manner of life from which many persons profited. This involved very heavy expenditure, and the heir's nee d of money was all the greater since the appanage allott ed to him by his father was—according to his ideas at any rate —ludicrously inadequate. The consequence was that t he prince found his way to the firm which owed its ris e and prosperity to his father. He applied to Rothschild for a loan. Naturally, this was done quite in secret, without t he knowledge or consent of the elector. At the beginni ng of 1818 the prince requested a loan of 200,000 reichst halers, which the House of Rothschild granted; but before s ix months had expired he asked for a further advance o f 300,000 reichsthalers. On this occasion he remarked that the House of Rothschild had the fullest information re- garding the elector's affairs, and could therefore easily provide for the subsequent repayment of the loan. Carl Rothschild happened to be in Cassel at the tim e. The prince immediately summoned him, and informed him that he had again applied to his firm for money , making the same remark to him as he had made to the firm. Carl Rothschild left the audience chamber in re- flective mood. He thought it exceedingly strange th at the prince should already have incurred further deb ts, and he was somewhat annoyed at the remark which he had made in asking for the loan. There was a risk t hat the old. elector might come to hear of his son's bo rrow- ings, and they would arouse his indignation not onl y with his son but also with the firm of Rothschild. Car l Roths- child met a chamberlain in the anteroom, and made some remark which may have sounded ill-tempered abo ut the request for a further loan. A f t e r returning to Frankfort Carl took counsel with Amschel, who was there alone; the result was embodi ed in the following letter: 12 "},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"196 The Rise of the House of Rothschild M OST E XCELLENT P RINCE !

Your Highness will be graciously aware that we can act only in agreement with our absent brothers, and we shall therefore not fail to communicate to them your Highness's letter, asking them for their views. In the meantime we would most submissively beg for a gracious explana- tion of the following passage in your Highness's letter, in which your Highness is pleased to state: \"You have the best possible knowledge of the elec- tor's business here, and it is therefore particular ly easy for you to reimburse yourselves through dis- counting bills.\" Our knowledge of the elector's affairs extends only to such business as we are entrusted to carry out. It is impossible for us to retain a single farthing an d to apply it in the interest of your Highness, for we f ur- nish the fullest accounts of the smallest transacti on and send them to Cassel. This letter was to fulfil a double object: it would stave off the prince for the time being, and it would als o be a protection against any reproaches from the elector if the matter leaked out. The letter displeased the prince exceedingly; he pe r- ceived the rebuke and would have liked to reply ind ig- nantly. But he restrained his feelings as he still hoped to get money from the Rothschilds. However, he felt that in these circumstances it was difficult for hi m to carry on the negotiations personally. He accordingl y selected Buderus as a go-between, requesting him to keep the matter strictly secret from the elector. \"Having learned of the chance arrival of Baron Carl von Rothschild,\" the prince wrote to Buderus, 13 antici-"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"The Period of Congresses 197 pating the future title of the family, \"I felt that I should inform him of the application I had made to his fir m, and did so most politely.

He immediately informed Buderus that he was not going to be fobbed off with a few thousand friedrichdors, an d added a remark which savored strongly of a threat. \"I know,\" 15 he wrote, \"that these gentlemen will be entirely guided by what you say, and my gratitude i n future to Privy Councilor von Carlshausen will be c om- mensurate with his readiness to do me a service now .\" The letter went on to make proposals as to how the 300,000"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"198 The Rise of the House of Rothschild reichsthalers might in spite of everything be obtai ned from Rothschild.

The young prince would have gladly paid the firm of Rothschild ten percent interest if only he could ha ve got the money. Von Carlshausen was instructed by th e Rothschilds to inform him that the firm never accep ted interest at ten percent as this would be a usurious rate. Thereupon the prince wrote as follows to his father 's loyal servant: \"I am well aware that the House of Rothschild can loan no capital sums in cash at five percent withou t loss, and at the same time that the prestige of the firm is too great to allow them to take a higher rate of intere st— a fact which is entirely to their credit, although in these times no objection could be made to the higher rate .

A far-reaching political development now diverted the firm's attention from such minor loan transacti ons, concentrating it exclusively upon the higher politi cs of Europe. The victorious powers had decided to meet i n a congress at Aix-la-Chapelle, there to establish n ew rela- tions with the France of the Restoration, as well a s to dis- cuss the question whether the armies of occupation should be withdrawn, and alleviation granted for the indem ni- ties to be paid. England and the eastern powers wer e still suspicious of France; and the interest aroused by t his congress was so great that the monarchs of the Holy Alli- ance attended it in person, while England was repre - sented by the two foremost men of the day, Lord Cas tle- reagh and Wellington. Metternich meant to use this opportunity to secure the support of the tsar and the King of Prussia for his schemes by playing on their fears of revolution and gen- eral upheaval. Besides the numerous statesmen, the most prominent bankers and merchants of Europe flocked t o Aix-la-Chapelle, scenting prey. Most of them travel ed through Frankfort and availed themselves of the opp or- tunity of getting into touch with the financial wir e-pullers in the commercial center of Germany. Metternich too had come to Frankfort on September 3, 1818, accom- panied by Gentz. Gentz was his secretary and adviser in money matter s; but he was interested not only in his country's but also in his own personal advantage. With rare candor he not es in his diary that in 1815 he received a purse with three hundred ducats and one with eight hundred ducats from Russia, and that Prussia had given him—an Austrian civil servant—eight hundred ducats and two hundred gold napoleons as a gratuity. 21 He was also quite open about the fact that the Jewish banker La mel"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"The Period of Congresses 201 had given him money and that Parish had given him a share of the Austrian loan of May, 1818. Gentz call ed such transactions \"pleasant financial dealings.\" 22 His way of referring to them is so candid that one gets the impression that the circumstances of those times pr e- vented his being in the least conscious of anything im- proper in such gifts. Prince Metternich came into contact with all the lo cal magnates at Frankfort, including Bethmann. He seems not yet to have met Rothschild personally at this t ime, hut this defect was more than made good by his righ t- hand man Frederick von Gentz. The brothers Roths- child were well aware of the great influence that G entz exerted upon Metternich in matters concerning the s tate finances, and through him upon the minister of fina nce, Count Stadion. They knew also that Gentz was bribab le, whereas they naturally did not venture to approach Met- ternich in such a way. Amschel Meyer and Carl Rothschild therefore called on Gentz immediately after his arrival. This visit re- sulted in verbal agreements of a financial nature; and they also requested him to use his influence with t he prince toward securing his support in the question of the Frankfort Jews; for at that time the senate 23 was attempt- ing to dispute the competence of the diet to deal w ith the Jewish problem, arguing that it was a purely local matter. The pressure brought to bear by the Rothschilds upo n Gentz, and through him upon Metternich, resulted in the senate's objection being disallowed, and a commissi on of the diet being appointed to mediate between the two parties. This decision, taken on September 10, 1818, moved t he brothers to call on Gentz again on September 12, an d to \"engage his interest\" by a further detailed expo sition of the whole matter.

Amsc hel made no slight effort to have distinguished people at his table; but, as Johann Smidt, Mayor of Bremen, state d, 25 it was not in accordance with contemporary customs and manners to admit a Jew to so-called good society. N o Christian banker or merchant of Frankfort had yet i n- vited a Jew, not even one of the Rothschild brother s, to dine, and the delegates to the diet did not do so e ither. However, several people were beginning to depart fr om this tradition, and accepted invitations from the R oths- childs, either from an absence of prejudice, or fro m mo- tives of personal interest.

Besides monarchs and statesm en, it included financial magnates such as Baring and H ope, who were negotiating the French loans in connection with the payment of the war indemnity. The firm of Roths - child had sent two brothers to Aix-la-Chapelle, Sol omon and Carl. The latter was accompanied by his bride, the beautiful and intelligent Adelheid Herz, whom he ha d married on September 16, so that his business journ ey to the congress coincided with his honeymoon. In the c ase of the House of Rothschild even the most important per- sonal considerations had to yield to important busi ness, and to such a unique opportunity for forming extens ive new connections. Through Gentz, Metternich was brought into actual touch with the two brothers at Aix-la-Chapelle. Gen tz fell completely under their influence, and his diar y con- stantly records their visits. On October 27 Solomon handed him eight hundred ducats, which he stated he had won by speculating for him in British funds. 28 On November 2, Gentz again records 27 \"pleasant finan- cial dealings\" with Solomon, and on November 12 the brothers, together with Gentz and Parish, lunched w ith Metternich. In spite of his heavy work in keeping t he minutes of the congress, Gentz spent the whole of t he next day working on a memorandum stating the case for th e Jews of Frankfort, no doubt in return for financial con- siderations. He called upon Carl's young wife, who was highly flattered to be waited upon by the secretary and confidant of the man who was playing the leading ro le in the illustrious assembly. At the Rothschilds' reque st, Gentz supported Dr. Buchholz, whom the Jews had sen t to Aix-la-Chapelle to secure a favorable decision.

This business does not itself appear to have brough t much profit to the firm of Rothschild, but it secured it s prestige in the eyes of the British Treasury, and demonstrat ed to the whole world that in the face of native competit ion it had maintained its position as the banker of Englan d— a nation which now, after Napoleon's overthrow, was re- joicing in its undisputed political power and wealt h. James in Paris was in constant close association wi th Barbier, the chairman of the Austrian Liquidation C om- mittee in that city. He continued his efforts in ri valry with other firms, to secure the handling of the war in- demnity, and so extended his business. While the House was thus prospering throughout the world, its existence was suddenly most seriously th reat- ened in the home town of Frankfort. The family had just lost one of its best friends there—the man to whom must properly be ascribed the important part of hav ing first held the ladder on which the House of Rothsch ild had climbed to such heights. On August 3, 1819, whi le sitting at his desk in Hanau, Buderus had a stroke. A short glance at the papers which he left shows th at he had spent his whole life in meticulous devotion to the exacting work of accountancy. The son of a poor sch ool- master, he had risen to the rank of privy councilor and head of the treasury. He had acquired a fine estate and was possessed of about one and a half million gulde n. 30 "},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"The Period of Congresses 207 All this was, however, a trifling reward, when one con- siders the services he rendered to the elector duri ng the Napoleonic period, and the enormous portions of the elector's possessions he rescued.

Ac- cording to the story, much property is supposed to have been stolen by them. In general, any opportunity fo r showing envy and ill-will is welcomed, all sense of jus- tice being forgotten, although many rich Jews are a source of substantial income to Christians. Any right-thin king person will condemn the fact, for instance, that a carica- ture ridiculing his ennoblement 33 was recently pinned to the door of the Jewish banker Rothschild at Fran kfort. \"Rothschild, although he indulges somewhat in dis- play, provides many people with an opportunity of e arn- ing money thereby, and is exceedingly benevolent to the poor whether they be Christians or Jews.

A farce called \"Unser Verkehr\" (\"Our Neighbors\") was played throughout Germany, which, to the uproar i- ous applause of the spectators, ridiculed the manne rs and customs of the Jews. 34 The author was unknown, and everybody said that the House of Rothschild had off ered a reward for his discovery. In August, 1819, the Conferences of Ministers, over which Metternich presided, met at Carlsbad to decid e upon the notorious measures against any movement of liberation; the resulting excitement found an outle t in a violent outbreak of popular passion against the Jew s. Wiirzburg was the first town in which acts of viole nce were perpetrated. The populace gathered together in groups which marched past the Jews' houses, smashin g windows and breaking down doors. They began to loot . \"Hepp! Hepp! Down with the Jews!\" 35 resounded through the streets. Similar scenes occurred in Bam berg and other towns. The Jews of Frankfort were all the more dismayed by these occurrences, as there had been menacing signs of a similar movement developing in that city. Amschel Meyer Rothschild and his two brothers, who on accou nt of their wealth were likely to be the principal obj ect of any attack, began to feel that their lives were ser iously threatened, and to consider the question of flight. One of the brothers seems to have spoken of their i n- tentions to an Austrian official, for, writing on A ugust 6, a secretary of legation at Frankfort reports as follo ws: 36 \"I have the honor tentatively to inform you that I have learned from a reliable source that the Jewish bank ing firm of Rothschild here intends to leave Frankfort for good ; they are going to apply, through the imperia l min- ister of finance Count von Stadion for permission t o settle in Vienna.

They w ere all the more likely to culminate in deeds of violen ce in that city since the populace knew that in its hatre d of the Jews it enjoyed the sympathy of the highest authori ties in the town. The occasion for the outbreak was a trifl ing one. On the evening of August 10, 1819, some youths walked through the Jewish quarter provocatively sho ut- ing \"Hepp, Hepp!\" Several Jews who happened to be standing at their doors joined to drive the youths out of their street, and beat one of the brawlers who had fallen into their hands. Thereupon the rumor spread throug h Frankfort like lightning that a Christian had been killed by the Jews. Crowds collected instantaneously and moved shouting through the Jewish quarter, breaking up windows and shops with stones. The house of the Rothschilds was also attacked, and all their window-panes lay scattered about the streets. The family had had to take refuge in t he back room, where they listened trembling to the threaten ing shouts of the mob.

In any case, the report of the department revealed that it desired the House of Rothschild to emigrate to Vienna. This was all the more remarkable as the position of the Jews in Austria was far from being an enviable one. They had not the right of owning land in any part o f the imperial dominions; law and custom excluded them fr om administration and the courts, from the practice of the law and from the teaching profession, from all high er posts in the army, and from any political functions and offices.

Also s ums to the value of about three million francs, payable in sat- isfaction of Austria's claims upon France, were tra ns- mitted to Vienna, the firm of Rothschild receiving one percent of the payments effected. 46 Finally, the brothers had heard from a confidential source in Milan that there was an amount of money in the state treasury there 47 which the government wished to transfer to Vienna. They immediately offered to carry this out. It involved a transmission of two million lira in g old Coins, and Solomon, who was again staying at Vienna , quickly got into personal touch with the treasury i n order to discuss the best means of sending this sum from Milan to Vienna through exchange operations. The firm of Rothschild stated that they would undertake the tra nsfer of any sum whatever at the cheapest rate possible, and that they could arrange the business to the greates t advan- tage of the imperial interests. 48 For this service they and the firm of Gontard received one-half percent commi s- sion and one-eighth percent brokerage, so that for the simple transmission of the money from Milan to Vien na they received 12,933 lira in gold. Their extensive transactions necessitated a volumin ous correspondence, the rapid transmission of which was a difficult problem under the primitive conditions of those times.

Sometimes the couriers themselves intercepted letters in transit. \"Such inspection,\" Bethmann wrote on the occasion of a visit to Vienna, 51 \"is inevitable, and Rothschild and Parish are as little able to avoid it as Herr von G ey- miiller, although the latter enjoys the full confid ence of Prince Metternich.

As they had a great deal to say to one another that they did not wish anyone else to hear and also attached great importance to the speedy receip t of news in advance of normal methods, they decided to have their own system of couriers. They would be reimbur sed for the heavy expense of this arrangement at one st roke if their firm thereby received early news of any po litical event that might affect the exchange. An example of this occurred when the Duke of Berry was murdered. The duke was the nephew of the King of France, and as Louis XVIII had no children, the hopes of the Bourbons were centered upon him. As he was leaving the opera on February 13, 1820, he was assas- sinated by a political fanatic who thought to save France by exterminating the Bourbons. According to Handel' s statement 52 the Rothschilds heard of this long before anyone else; they made appropriate arrangements for themselves, and then made the event known.

This certainly cannot be proved, but it is highly probable, for on one occasion, when the b rothers entrusted a letter to an ambassador, the letter was imme- diately \"perused.\" Proof of this is furnished by the fol- lowing two letters: on November 28, 1819, 53 Handel re- ported as follows to Metternich: \"The banker Carl v on Rothschild, who left for Vienna today, asked us to put several letters to various German ministers meeting at Vienna, which he had been asked to take with him, i n a packet and seal it with the embassy seal, so that h e could bring them over the frontier without risk.

On April 7 the first 20,00 0,000 gulden were, in accordance with Solomon's suggestio n, issued to the firms of Rothschild and Parish in the form of a lottery loan, a method which was still unusual at that time, and which never failed of its effect upo n the general public. Nothing was said at the time of the negotiations th at were already in progress for the issue of a further 35,000- gulden loan; and everyone subscribed to this loan i n the confident belief that it would be the only lottery loan for the time being.

I personally regard all these statements as slanders without any foundation . The feeling about the loan was so bitter at first that a pro- posal was made among all ranks of society to form leagues, the members of which should pledge themsel ves not to take bonds exceeding the value of 100 gulden from the Rothschilds.\" There were other critics who did not deny that Sta- dion's intentions were honest, but gave him to unde rstand that they believed the minister of finance had been hope- lessly done.

The ter ms were such that the state would have to repay 76,821 ,515 gulden as capital and interest in return for the 35 ,000,000 gulden which it had received. In addition the state paid a commission of 4%, amounting to 1,400,000 gulden. These conditions which were approved by Emperor Francis made the loan one of the most lucrative tra nsac- tions of the time. For the firm not merely exploite d the public's gambling instincts to sell the bonds at a good price, it also influenced the rate of exchange thro ugh its connections with the principal bourses. It was obvi ous that the Rothschilds would have to reckon with the fall In the price of the twenty-million issue as soon as it be- came known that a further loan of thirty-five milli ons was to be made so soon afterwards. But before this was made public they had placed the original issue at a price well above par, so that when the second loan was is sued the earlier bonds were almost all in other people's hands. There was naturally at once a storm of indignation against the enterprising bankers; but the first iss ue soon recovered, and the bonds of both issues were eagerl y sought.

The firm did not yet contemplate establi shing a branch similar to those in London and Paris, alth ough this was done eventually as the result of its intim ate asso- ciation with the finance and policy of Austria. Solomon Rothschild had taken up his quarters in one of the leading hostelries of Vienna, known as the H otel of the Roman Emperor, No. 1 Renngasse. It had some of the most distinguished visitors at that time, in cluding the King of Wurttemberg in the year 1820. This was the only hotel with a large concert room, 61 and its acoustic properties were excellent. Beethoven often gave rec itals there, and occasionally he stayed, it is supposed, at the Roman Emperor. Solomon lived at the hotel until he was given the f ree- dom of the city of Vienna. Eventually, it is true, he was the only guest in the hotel, for he occupied all th e rooms. In the end he bought the building, as well as the h ouse next it, No. 3 Renngasse. This is still in the poss ession of the family, while an insurance company acquired what was once the Roman Emperor Hotel. Meanwhile Metternich's confidence in the firm of Rothschild had increased. The family perceived this , and when they saw any signs of big business they wo uld let him know through Gentz that they would like to carry it out. James had learned in Paris that the allies had de- cided in 1815 to put aside twenty million francs of the Paris war indemnity for the erection of a fourth co n- federate fortress on the Rhine. 62 James in Paris and Solomon in Vienna immediately offered to send this money to Frankfort so that the diet might have it available in current coin at their he adquar- ters.

The two brothers, by a concerted arrangement, each made an offer that, if the money were left in their hands, the one in Paris would pay 3 1/2% and the one in Vi enna would pay 3% until the building work on the fortres s actually commenced. That might be a long time yet, as indeed events proved. Barbier observed in this c on- nection (in a letter to Buol) 63 that in carrying out Met- ternich's instructions he had arranged that the die t should retain the right to demand security for the twenty mil- lions from the House of Rothschild if this sum were de- posited with them. \"The House of Rothschild,\" he wrote, \"is undoubtedl y one of the richest and best-established firms in Eu rope, but we thought it wiser to take this precaution as over twenty million francs are involved, which may be on deposit with them for quite a long period if the co n- struction of the new fortress should be still furth er de- layed.\" Thus while the government itself paid 5% for ready money it left this large sum on deposit with the fi rm of Rothschild at 3 1/2% interest for an indefinite tim e. The banking firm got the advantage of this unexpectedly cheap money just when important political events in the South of Europe threatened to disturb the peaceful at- mosphere that had been prevailing since the Congres s of Vienna.

Now, how- ever, that he was threatened by popular rising, he yielded all along the line and made the ringleader, General Pepe, commander-in-chief, and pledged himself to a consti tu- tion on the Spanish model. A similar movement was making progress in the islan d of Sicily, where the king's ministers had to make w ay for new men who were popular with the Carbonari. One of these ministers was the brilliant Luigi Cavaliere d e Med- ici, who managed to maintain order in the finances in spite of the extravagances of the ruling family, an d the privileges of the nobility and priesthood. Metternich, who was watching over Europe like a guardian angel, resented any signs of resistance to his \"principle of legitimacy.\" He had been deeply distu rbed by the news from Italy, which was within Austria's sphere of interest. If the revolutionary spirit should spr ead from Naples to the North and infect the territories that were under Austrian dominion, there was no saying w hat the results might be. He saw that his political sys tem, his influence, which already extended through the w hole of Europe, and the very existence of all the old le gitimist monarchies were endangered. He felt that every effo rt must be made to meet this peril, and summoned anoth er conference of monarchs to consider the point. The c on- ference met at Troppau in October, 1820, to discuss the principles to be applied if revolutionaries tried t o impose changes in the form of government anywhere in Europ e.

Metter- nich had succeeded in a masterly manner in gaining over the tsar to his point of view. \"It is a matter of indifference,\" he stated to that mon- arch, 64 \"whether the word be Bonaparte or the sover- eignty of the people; they are equally dangerous an d must therefore both be resisted. The Neapolitan revolt, and everything connected with it, must be completely st amped out, or else the powers themselves will be destroye d.\" Metternich concentrated absolutely on his one great political object, the overthrow of revolution. The troops and money necessary for this purpose had to be fort h- coming, and it was up to generals and financiers to see to the ways and means. The news of Metternich's plans, involving as they d id heavy additional expenditure, came as a severe shoc k to Stadion, who had done so much to put Austria's fina nces on a sound basis. He saw the edifice which he had s pent rears to erect shaken to its foundations. The revol utions had also affected the bourses, and state securities were fa l l i n g in price. Metternich, however, succeeded in be- ing so convincing through his influence with the pr ess, and the passionate communications sent by him from Laibach, that even those who had reason to be alarm ed about their property became adherents of Metternich 's plans of armed intervention in Naples. The chancell or had inquired of Stadion as to how the money could b e found, and whether Naples would subscribe to a loan . Stadion sent the following confidential letter in r eply: 65 \"Even our financiers, led by Rothschild and Parish, are anxious to see our troops across the Po at the earliest possible moment, and marching on Naples. I have wri t- ten to Count von Mercy regarding the Neapolitan loa n."},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"230 The Rise of the House of Rothschild I suppose you have spoken only to Rothschild about it?

In any c ase it is essential to lay our plans carefully so that the money does not merely come in at one door to go out of th e other.\" As Stadion considered the matter more closely, he b e- gan to feel distinctly uneasy. In normal circumstan ces the deficit for the year 1821 would have amounted t o eight million gulden; but very heavy additional sums of m oney were now required for the expeditionary force to It aly, and the greater part of this cash would have to be found immediately. As Stadion came to consider the heavy demands made upon the treasury by Metternich's poli cy, he felt a growing sense of bitterness. Metternich, the chancellor whose financial ideas did not extend muc h be- yond a general realization that a state no less tha n a pri- vate individual must have money, carried out his po licy without any consideration of the cost. Stadion was ex- pected to produce the necessary funds as if by magi c, and he really was at a loss how to do it. The chancellor advised Stadion to see the Rothschil ds, and urged him to discuss with the brothers the mean s for raising the amount necessary for the campaign. The emigrant Jews from Frankfort had suddenly become th e sheet-anchor for Austria's two leading statesmen, o ne of whom exercised an influence upon the destinies of E urope extending far beyond the boundaries of the imperial dominions. While at Laibach, Metternich had asked Count Nes- selrode, the Russian minister for foreign affairs, who was just about to leave for Vienna, to urge Stadion to ask Solomon Rothschild to come himself to Laibach and e x- press his personal opinion there regarding the issu e of loans to Russia and Austria.

He therefore wrote the following l etter to Count Nesselrode: 66 Y OUR E XCELLENCY : With reference to the business matter under con- sideration, I venture most respectfully to observe that a discussion on this matter at Laibach, and my pres - ence there, might give rise to numerous and probabl y highly inaccurate newspaper reports.

My con- tinued presence here would dissipate all rumors, while everything would be carried on under the strictest seal of secrecy, and the business could b e transacted in peace and quietness. Solomon Rothschild sent a similar communication to Count Stadion at the same time, and the count immed i- ately wrote 67 to Metternich to say that in his opinion Solo- mon's contention that neither he nor any other bank er should'go to the congress at Laibach was absolutely sound. \"In addition to the arguments which he has brought forward,\" he wrote, \"I submit that the following po ints have to be taken into consideration.

Carl had, since his youngest days, been accustomed to making long journeys on his father's business. Now at the age of thirty-three a promising field for his a ctivi- ties was offered him, although it was in a country that he had only once casually visited, and the language of which he did not know. This, however, did not affec t the matter, for it seemed to be a merely provisiona l arrangement, and Carl little guessed that Naples wo uld come to be his permanent place of abode. On March 1 , Carl Rothschild arrived at Vienna from Frankfort an d immediately called on Stadion. \"Un petit frere Rothschild,\" Stadion reported to Me t- ternich, 72 \"has just arrived here on his way to Naples.

Its march was somewhat delayed through the insufficiency of provi sions and of money. Count Ficquelmont, who was accompany- ing the army on his way to take up his duties as am bas- sador at Naples, wrote: \"We are all suffering acute ly from the disastrous shortage of money.\" Application was made at Rome to Torlonia and other banking firms, b ut in vain. A stirring appeal was made by Metternich w ith a view to remedying these evils. On receiving a rep ort from Vienna, Metternich had published a statement regarding the whole expedition, in order to pacify the Viennese public, who did not understand what busine ss Austria had in Naples. Count Sedlnitzky welcomed th is step, wishing the chancellor luck in carrying on hi s policy on the grand scale, and reported: 74 \"Through an arrangement made in the nick of time by the thoroughly worthy House of Rothschild and ot her firms, regarding Wertheimer's failure, the market h ere has been saved from being flooded with Metalliques bonds, and a gradual rise in their value as well as in that of other state securities has been effected.

Carl replied as follows: \"I have the honor to reply to your Princely Highness's gracious inquiry of today that I am prepared to undertake the journey at once to a ny place where your Princely Highness may bid me go, a nd to do everything in my power to see that the paymen ts which you have graciously commissioned me to make t o the army are carried out with the greatest possible speed and precision.

When the Austrian troops started for the South, a r is- ing broke out in Alessandria too, the object of whi ch was to secure a constitution, and the abdication of the autocratic king. The news of these events caused di smay at Laibach. The assembled diplomats were like a swa rm of bees that has been disturbed.

The impression m ade at Vienna was no less profound. Stadion completely lost his nerve. \"The situation is terrifying,\" he wrote to Metternich. 81 \"Never, not even in the darkest hours of the revolutionary wars, has an event produced such an effect on the Vienna bourse as the latest news from Italy. ... If the enemy were at the gates there could not be more unreasoning panic. The whole of the population of Vienna is rushing to the bourse to get rid of ou r public securities. . . . Our credit (which has only just b een established) is on the eve of vanishing completely. I shall be forced to suspend the conversion of paper money into cash or banknotes on demand.

The panic reached its height on March 22. On that day Stadion wrote again to Metternich, describing t he complications in Naples and Piedmont as amounting t o the destruction of Austria. 82 He wrote: \"If all the misfortunes that appear imminent today come upon us at once, I must confess I see no hope of salvation. Never- theless we must try to put an end to the Naples adv enture as speedily as possible, and thus at least save the army's honor. All troops should be withdrawn to within our frontiers and kept in readiness to meet attacks fro m abroad and from the revolutionary spirit at home.\" Metternich said nothing, but proceeded to set troop s in motion for quelling the revolt. It was Stadion's busi- ness and not his to raise the necessary money. The for- mer had already spent money which was earmarked for the year 1822, and his pronounced sense of responsi bility caused him to take a darker view of recent events t han was strictly justified. Metternich, however, infect ed his imperial master, who was staying with him at Laibac h, with his own spirit of resolute calm, and the emper or wrote a reassuring letter to the King of Naples. Th e king had just left Laibach, having borrowed the mon ey for the journey to Florence from the Emperor Franci s, as he had no funds himself. While assuring the king that his interests were identical with his own, the emperor did not forget about the repayment of the journey m oney, and issued instructions that the cash should immedi ately be provided out of the Rothschild loan which was be ing planned in Naples. 83 On March 24 the expeditionary force had entered Naples without encountering serious resistance. The news of this event put an end to the rising in Pied mont; Lombardy remained quiet; and the general informatio n received at Laibach gave reason to hope that the wh ole movement would die down.

It was now possible completely to r eas- sure Carl, and to persuade him that the journey to Flor- ence, where the King of Naples was still staying wi th his retinue, was absolutely safe. Before he started on the further journey to the capital at the foot of Vesuv ius, the Austrian troops there would have reestablished comp lete order and security. It was on March 23 that Gentz had made these reas- suring observations to Carl Rothschild, using the o ppor- tunity to ask for a small personal loan. Carl, who was not so quick at appreciating Gentz's influence as h is brothers had been, made difficulties, with the resu lt that, to use his own words, \"an unpleasant discussion\" en sued. When he got back home Rothschild learned that Met- ternich wished him to leave for Florence on the fol lowing day. He felt some misgivings regarding the disoblig ing at t i t u d e he had adopted toward the right-hand man o f the all-powerful chancellor; and he thought that his br other Solomon would be annoyed with him if he had parted from Gentz in ill-will. He accordingly called on Ge ntz late that evening in order, as the latter put it, \" to make good his error.\" Metternich had given Carl Rothschild a letter of in tro- duction to the Austrian general, Baron Vincent, who was stayi n g at Florence with the King of Naples. The gen- eral had long known of the Austrian government's fi nan- cial intentions regarding a loan to be issued in Na ples. He knew that the Allies had agreed with the king at Laibach that the costs of the expedition should be borne by the kingdom of Naples from the moment when the army crossed the Po, and that the cost of maintaini ng the army in Naples should also be borne by that kingdom . Mettern i c h had sent Vincent the following instructi ons on the matter as early as March 1, 1821: \"The point regarding the loan is of great importanc e for our finances.

He is the more concerned about this since, if the monarchy we re to incur such a heavy loss, the resulting financial em barrass- ment might produce results which nobody can foresee .\" 84 Shortly before Carl Rothschild's departure Metterni ch followed up these instructions with a letter 85 stating that Rothschild was coming only in order to negotiate fo r the Neapolitan loan. Although this firm had not yet put for- ward definite terms, Metternich wrote, it was desir able that the Neapolitan government should hand over to the House of Rothschild bonds coming within the scheme of their general system of credit at a fixed price, an d leave it to the firm to reimburse itself by issuing these bonds at its own risk at a price which would yield it a p rofit. Should the House of Rothschild demand a guarantee from Austria for the due carrying out of the obliga tions of the Neapolitan government, Vincent was authorize d to accept such a condition if it was necessary. He was urged, however, to ask Rothschild to put his propos als into writing, and to press for a speedy conclusion of the agreement. This was urgent in the interests of Aust ria's finances.

Metternich concluded by saying: \"We must naturally take no direct part in these bus i- ness negotiations, but we are very much interested in their success. The loan is destined to cover a part of th e costs of the expedition, as well as to meet the expenses of main- taining and paying our army. You are invited, there fore, if Herr von Rothschild's first proposals are accept ed by the Neapolitan minister, to facilitate the conclusi on of t h e i r business through your good offices.\" Carl Rothschild arrived in Florence on March 31. On Vincent's introduction he had a short interview with Prince Ruffo, 86 but he was coolly received and was not given any explanation as to the minister's intentio ns. He had to wait for news from James, who had been reque sted by Solomon to express his views regarding the Neapo litan business. Vincent advised Rothschild to go to Na ples and inform himself as to the prospect on the spot, for Ruffo had been absent so long that he was completel y uninformed as to the financial situation. The Amb assa- dor took the opportunity of borrowing 1,000 ducats 87 on the government's account, the advance for his offic ial expenses having long been exhausted. Rothschild g ladly lent the desired amount. Although the agreements were kept secret, and nobod y knew that that firm had been granted absolute prior ity, the news of a loan to be issued by Naples became kn own in other banking circles. A Milanese, by name Bar baia, approached Vincent, and in agreement with certain French firms offered 88 to advance thirty millions to the N e a p o l i t a n government at an issue price of 60%. \" My fear is,\" Vincent replied, \"that this may conflict with our arragements with the House of Rothschild and co n- fuse them.\" Barbaia was not a negligible rival.

On April 6 he proceeded to Naples. Vincent gave him a letter to Ambassador Count Ficquelmont, informing the count of the offer being made by Barbaia, and o f Austria's anxiety that the loan should be intrusted to the firm of Rothschild. The king himself did not yet da re to return to Naples. In accordance with Metternich' s instructions the general commanding at Naples mean- while restrained the newly installed government fro m considering loans proposed by various Italian banki ng firms before Rothschild should have arrived. When h e arrived on April 12, Count Ficquelmont immediately introduced him to the government, who informed him that they wished to take up a loan of twelve millio n ducats—about twenty million gulden. Under pressure from the Austrian general the govern - ment had ignored Barbaia's offers, although the Mil anese had brought a letter from the King of Naples recomm end- ing him. The king had instinctively felt that the H ouse of Rothschild would act in Austria's interests rath er than his own; but he was king only by the grace of Austr ia, and that country could call the tune. The House of Rothschild stated that they were pre- pared to grant a loan of ten million ducats. 90 They added that they would at first make only six millions ava ilable, the balance to be paid when they had placed the six mil- lion. The bonds were to be issued at 54; 3% commiss ion was to be paid; and an undertaking was to be given that during the continuance of the agreement no new loan should be issued. Moreover, in any future loans t he firm"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"The Period of Congresses 247 was to be given the preference before any other. Fo r sinking-fund purposes and for greater security they de- manded that the state domains should be pledged. These were hard conditions. Public securities then stood at 60%, so that the issue price was very low, and all the more favorable to the Rothschilds, as they inte nded to issue the state bonds (which had hitherto been d ealt with only on the Naples bourse) and, through their London and Paris houses, to put them on the market in those cities. The Neapolitan finance minister, Marc hese d'Andrea, considered the proposals to be far less a dvan- tageous than those of certain Neapolitan firms, and there- fore entirely unacceptable. The minister was of opi nion that instead of helping the state the conditions wo uld be a serious blow to its credit, since it was impossib le to place any confidence in a government that sold its securi- ties at such a low rate. He held that there was no reason for selling bonds at 54 when the ruling price was 6 0. The government was not so pressed for money as those ap - peared to believe who put such proposals forward. 91 Meanwhile, news had been received that the revoluti on at Naples had collapsed. Ficquelmont summoned Carl Rothschild and told him that Austria was desirous that the House of Rothsch ild sh o u l d handle the loan. The ambassador requested hi m not to make it too difficult for Austria to bring t he nec- essary pressure to bear upon the Neapolitan governm ent, but to moderate his terms somewhat. Rothschild replied that his first proposals were no t his last word in the matter; he had been asked to make an offer, and he had done so by way of opening negotia tions. The good news received from Piedmont made it possib le for him now to offer better conditions.

That government owed its very existence to the Austrians, and it was obvious that it would have. to conclude the agreement with those whom the Austr ians wished. The ambassador at Naples had completely understood what was in the minds of the leading men at Vienna. \"If the House of Rothschild carries through a loan of any kind,\" he wrote to Metternich, 92 \"that fact will pro- vide us with the necessary security. As we have not yet made any direct or positive demand for reimbursemen t of our expenses, I did not feel that it was possibl e to include in the terms of the loan any explicit condi tion regarding direct payments to Austria [by the House of Rothschild]. Herr Rothschild, who always keeps our interests in view in the negotiations, has therefor e in- serted the words in his draft terms, 'payable to th ose who shall be authorized to receive the money.' This con dition will become applicable when our direct negotiations have settled the amount to be paid to us.\" The ambassador was anxious that the Neapolitan finances should be spared as much as possible so th at there should not be any doubt as to Naples' ability to pay the expenses of Austria's expeditionary force. \"If the current expenses for the maintenance of our arm y,\" Ficquelmont wrote to Metternich, \"can be met out of the ordinary revenue of the state, the whole amount of the loan could be paid into our treasury, except perhap s the first two or three instalments, which the governmen t will require ... in order to put the taxing system in or der.\" Shortly afterwards the loan was issued, 16,000,000 ducats being taken up at 60 ducats for the 100 duca t bond. Rothschild allowed other Italian banking firms to t ake some small part in it in order to keep active oppos ition down.

Th is was not done from motives of disinterested friendsh ip, and the brothers Rothschild paid for the privilege— with Neapolitan money. Meanwhile the forces of reac - tion were playing havoc at Naples. People were arre sted in thousands, the death penalty and long terms of i mpris- onment were meted out to the Carbonari and the revo lu- tionary officers. A strict censorship was also inst ituted. These conditions continued after the return of the king, and as all these things were being done under the p rotec- tion of Austrian bayonets, the foreign troops did n ot gain any sympathy in the country. All classes, excepting the conservative upper class, regarded them as undesira ble guests; and resentment against the Austrians was he ight- ened by the fact that they were using a clever fore igner to force the country itself to pay for their occupa tion.

The result was that soon after their issu e they rose considerably in price. Nathan was clever at securing people's support, and at getting publicity for himself. A young clerk from t he commercial department of the treasury at Vienna, by name Anton Laurin, had been sent to study in Englan d for some months during the summer of 1820, and was naturally referred to the Austrian consul in London , Nathan Rothschild. Nathan showed a great deal of kindness to Laurin, as he naturally assumed that he would send a report home. He acted as his mentor, and inv ited him frequently to dinner and supper. He was so successful in securing the young man's af - fection that Laurin gave the most ecstatic not to s ay ex- travagant and almost tedious accounts of him when h e returned home. He sent in such an enthusiastic repo rt to his chief that the latter decided to convey the essential points in it to the emperor, with the request that Nathan should be specially commended.

As he knew that James in Paris desired the dignity of an Austrian c onsul- general, for the same reasons as his brother in Lon don, he suggested, on March 30, that James should be ap- pointed. The highest quarters did not give any immediate de- cision in this matter, but the Neapolitan revolutio n oc- curred shortly afterwards, involving the close coop eration between Metternich and the House of Rothschild. It was no longer thought either desirable or possible to re- fuse the brothers anything, as it depended upon the ir attitude whether or not Austria should recover the money spent on the expeditionary force. Solomon gave his brother James at Paris to understand that he should renew his application to be appointed consul-general, for now was the critical moment, as the Austrian government was more or less in a cleft stick. As it was under an o bliga- tion to the House and closely associated with it, i t could not turn the request down. James asked Solomon, as he stood so well in Vienna, to put forward the request himself. Solomon drafted a petition to the emperor, and handed it to Stadion, who, in consideration of the indispensability of Solomon and his family, conveyed it to the emperor with the fol lowing memorandum: 98 \"I venture to support this petition, which your Maj esty was previously not pleased to entertain, for the fo llowing reasons, which relate particularly to present circu m- stances, and to conditions obtaining during the las t few years.

In the precarious state of Aust ria's finances resulting from recent events, it was only thus that popular feeling and the government's credit could b e maintained at the point where they now stand. Throu gh the Rothschilds' clever management, the cost of the ex- tensive monetary movements during the military oper a- tions was low compared with any other method of rem it- ting money. \"Through the great services which the Rothschild firms have rendered to us during a most eventful pe riod, their existence has become most intimately bound up with that of the Austrian monarchy.

The Roths - childs had in fact made themselves unpopular with t he more Liberal section of the public abroad, through the contracts which they had made everywhere with the r e- established reactionary governments.

James frequently advis ed him in money matters, and was very often a guest in his house. Emperor Francis referred James Rothschild's applica - tion to be appointed consul-general to the commerci al department of the treasury, with the instruction th at they should let him have their observations upon it. Rit ter von Stahl did not need to be asked twice to do this . He immediately transmitted the application to Stadion with the following observations: 100 \"England and France are by far the most cultivated states in Europe; in them agriculture, industry, an d com- merce flourish in the greatest harmony, and it is t here- fore most important for us to have in their capital s com- mercial agents who are experienced men, and enjoy a n extensive credit. ...

Thus another of the five brothers had climbed a rung in the ladder of s ocial position. Immediate payment for his Majesty's favor was re- quired. Since the Austrian army had entered Naples, the Neapolitan government had met all its expenses, inc lud- ing pay; but ten days after so whole-heartedly supp orting the petition, Metternich instructed Count Ficquelmo nt in Naples to get from that government the money that h ad been expended from the moment when the army crossed the Po. The finance minister had already pressed im - patiently to be indemnified for these expenses. 102 The advances already made were estimated at 4,650,000 gulden, and the money was to be repaid in Vienna in six monthly instalments, commencing on August 1, 1821. 103 Metternich sent a private letter to the count, toge ther with these instructions. 104 \"The ministry of finance,\" wrote the chancellor, \"a t- t a c h e s very great importance to the punctual and re liable repayment of the moneys which you are hereby instru cted to demand from the Neapolitan government, and it wi ll not tolerate any further excuses for delay.

It had been possible to make this payment out of existing funds, but further payments were to be met out of the loan of the House of Rothschild. 106 Thus part of the money sub- scribed for the loan never reached the Neapolitan T reas- ury at all, but was made over to Austria direct by the House of Rothschild, although Naples bore the whole burden of the loan. The government of that kingdom at this time made th e request of Carl Rothschild that in consideration of certain additional advantages he would, if possible, make h is loan payments to them earlier than was provided for under the agreement. Rothschild agreed, on conditio n that he was allowed to deduct the first two instalm ents of 700,000 gulden, and transmit them direct to Austria . Carl reported the conclusion of this agreement to Count Fic- quelmont, stating: \"I am accordingly glad to be in a position ... to g ive your Excellency the assurance that the first two pa yments are secured, and that I shall be making payments to your Excellency, instead of my brother making them in Vi enna."},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"The Period of Congresses 261 Your Excellency will no doubt realize that this was the principal reason which led me to fall in with the s ugges- tion—at some sacrifice to myself.

He made it easier for the Aus- trians to recover their expenses, and he paid the i nstal- ment on the loan to the Neapolitans before the agre ed dates. He himself did not do badly, for in June, 18 21, the bonds he had underwritten at 60, already stood at 76 1/2! The court of Naples had been in such urgent need of the advance payments on account of the loan that when Carl agreed to make them, he received a special let ter from the finance minister. 107 \"His Majesty,\" the letter ran, \"has instructed me t o communicate to you in his royal name, his full and gra- cious satisfaction with the consideration you have shown in the matters affecting the treasury.\" The king's debts to the emperor were also settled through the House of Rothschild by making a deducti on from the loan. The balance, so far as it was not used in the maintenance of the Austrian army, was not spent either carefully or usefully. In spite of all th e loans, therefore, the country continued to be oppressed by finan- cial stringency; and the Neapolitan ministers were con- stantly complaining of the annual charges (amountin g to nine m i l l i o n ducats) for maintaining the Austrian a rmy, which made any reasoned finance impossible.

The finance minister demanded immediate pay - ment in cash, as Naples was required to pay the mon ey free of all charges in Vienna. Carl took the stand that without his intervention and willingness, the Neapo litan government would have been absolutely unable to car ry out the obligation it had incurred to the Austrian court to pay four m i l l i o n gulden, so that he had felt him self justified in adopting this method of remitting the money. 108 Henceforward, however, he paid in cash, and simply debited the expense of remitting the money a nd the loss on exchange to the Neapolitan treasury. In such circumstances the first loan was naturally soon exhausted, and the Neapolitan finance minister foun d it necessary to apply to Carl Rothschild for a second loan. After lengthy negotiations a loan of the nominal am ount of 16,800,000 ducats was arranged at the end of Nov em- ber, 1821, which in view of a wider market and the re- sulting improvement in price was underwritten at 67 .3 in spite of the fact that the state's indebtedness had in- creased. When the amount of 1,400,000 gulden fell due on the last day of January, 1822, the finance minister him self asked Rothschild to make the payment out of the loa n, 109 as Naples was not able to find the money; for the s upport of the Austrian troops was a constant heavy burden on the treasury.

In this way they often acquir ed items of news that they could turn to account in business . \"Since arriving here,\" the Bremen burgomaster Smidt wrote from Frankfort, 110 \"I have found to my great aston- ishment that people like the Bethmanns, Gontards, B ren- tanos eat and drink with prominent Jews, invite the m to their houses and are invited back.

Buol, however, was inclin ed to follow out his own predilections, so that there was no immediate change in the situation; indeed the senat e showed a tendency to revert to increased harshness in dealing with the Jews. Thereupon Metternich firmly admonished Buol to put an end to this state of affa irs, with the result that the diet sent a kind of ultimatum t o the senate. The chancellor went even further; he traveled to Frankfort himself, and decided publicly to honor th e Rothschilds there by accepting an invitation to din e with them. He had let Amschel Meyer know this through Solomon at Vienna, who had just come into prominenc e again through an action which had won sympathetic r ec- ognition in high quarters. The I. and R.

The Austrian gentlemen here have assured me that they will also be present in such a case. If y our Highness wishes to come at another time, please com - mand me, for any man feels himself happy to be in your Highness's company. Metternich accepted the invitation and, accompanied by his intimate friend Countess Lieven, came to lun ch with Amschel Meyer, an event which did not fail of its effect upon the diet and upon society in Frankfort The two burgomasters of Frankfort, although invited, di d not come. The senate, however, was prepared to make all the concessions asked for, except to agree to the desig nation, \"Israelite citizens.\" Metternich had seriously to e mpha- size his \"definite wishes\" to the obstinate Buol, i nstructing him to act \"in strict accordance with them.\" But th e senate remained obdurate, Buol practiced passive re sis- tance, and the Jewish problem remained unresolved. While making these social and diplomatic efforts on behalf of the Jews in general and of the Rothschild s in particular, Metternich instructed Gentz to see that the House of Rothschild did not suffer in the press.

The zeal Gentz had shown in this matter was not attribu t a b l e entirely to Metternich's instructions. Since his return from Laibach to Vienna he had grown more and more intimate with Solomon Rothschild. He of ten had occasion to confer with him on behalf of his ch ief regarding the Neapolitan loan, and on one occasion Met- ternich made a very friendly remark to Gentz, regar ding the atti t u d e of the House of Rothschild in this mat ter. 116 It happened that on the following day Gentz met R o t h s c h i l d at a dinner given by the banker Eskeles at Hietzing; and he hastened to inform him of the \"rem ark- ably flatt e r i n g remarks made by the prince.\" This pro- duced, as Gentz himself records in his diary, resul ts most favorable able to himself. \"This morning,\" he notes, 117 on June 24, 1821, \"Roths-"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"263 The Rise of the House of Rothschild child paid me a very long visit; he told me the sam e re- markable story about his money and family affairs a s I had recently heard from the prince.

On New Year's Day Rothschild waited at Gentz's house until he came back from Metternich in order t o tell him that a courier was leaving for Naples next day, and that Gentz might send an urgent reminder regard ing the gratuity promised him by the court of Naples.

All the other foreign representatives were also of this opinion, but the king feared Medici as a ma n whose intellectual gifts would not accord well with his own autocratic temper.

Later on he raised a fourth loan of 2 1/2 million pounds sterling at the rate of 89 4/5, in order to acquire the necessary funds for paying the Austrian army for a further period, and for cov ering the deficit in the budget. Through arranging for the loan to be issued in ster ling instead of in ducats Nathan expected especially to interest English investors, 123 and in this he was successful. By February 26, 1824, the loan was already quoted at 9 6.75. The public debt of Naples, which before the revolut ion had stood at 28 million ducats, had risen by the ye ar 1824 to no less than 104 million ducats nominal, yet the bonds appreciated so considerably in value that some Neap oli- tan public securities stood at 108 in April, 1824. It might have been expected that as the amount of the debt i n- creased these quotations would fall, since, the inc ome having remained comparatively stationary, the secur ity for repayment of the debt diminished as the debt in - creased in amount.

Carl Rothschild had originally gone to Naples with the intention of rem aining there only for a short time, as its occupation by A ustrian troops was intended to be a temporary measure; but local conditions made it necessary that these troops shou ld re- main in the country for a much longer period, unles s by withdrawing them Metternich was prepared to risk ha v- ing the king and his reactionary supporters driven out of Naples. While the Austrians remained, the presence of Carl was an urgent necessity; and his wife, who had emba rked on the journey to Naples as a pleasure trip, made a r- rangements for a prolonged stay. Carl extended his busi- ness, and finally contrived to make himself indispe nsable to the Neapolitan court in financial matters. He struck roots in that beautiful city of southern Italy, and what had ar first seemed likely to be a brief business sojou rn was destined to develop into permanent residence.

Moritz von Bethmann, who was staying in Vienna in February, 1822, expres sed the following opinion regarding the House of Roths- child: 126 \"I can understand that the Rothschilds prove exceed - ingly useful instruments to governments, and am far from wishing to cast aspersions on them or from envying them their good fortune. Solomon especially is a man of the most estimable character, and I am exceedingly fond of him.

This is certainly a case where t he English proverb applies: 'Money makes money.' \"Observing their industry and judgment, we may ex- pect their business to continue to flourish; indeed one hopes so, since the overthrow of this Colossus woul d be terrible.

They tried again to induce the finance minister immediately to issue the loan on a larger scale, as they stated, 129 \"principally in order that the credulous and uninstructed public should have no occasion to be- lieve that a similar operation would be repeated at an early date.\" The letter concluded: \"In the full con vic- tion, that none, not even the smallest circumstance of any significance escapes the profound insight and busin ess acumen of your Excellency, we are confining ourselv es briefly to indicating the above consideration and a re con- tent to leave the appreciation of it entirely to yo ur Ex- cellency's wisdom and judgment.\" When the Austrian Treasury did not accept this offe r, Solomon Rothschild felt personally aggrieved.

Concurrently there were a large nu m- ber of small loans arranged in Germany and Austria, with the higher nobility, who were short of money in bot h countries. The loan, amounting to nine hundred thousand gulden , w h i c h Prince Metternich himself obtained from the House of Rothschild on September 23, is of particul ar interest. It was a perfectly straightforward busine ss; the loan bore jive per cent interest, and was to be rep aid by 1834; in fact the prince repaid it in full in 1827. There was nothing in the least suggestive of bribery abou t the transaction—Metternich was no Gentz—but it was boun d to make the chancellor, who thus became Solomon's debtor, feel not entirely free in his dealings with him. At all events it had the result that Metternich was mo re in- clined to be sympathetic to the personal wishes and re- quests of Solomon Rothschild and his brother.

The motto, \"Concor - dia, integritas, industria,\" was intended to expres s the harmony between the brothers, as well as their hone sty and tireless industry. In view of the enormous value attaching to any titl e of nobility in those times, the promotion to the rank of baron signified for the Jewish House, which only twenty y ears ago had been almost entirely unknown outside its na tive town, an almost immeasurable increase of prestige. The private life of the brothers also changed from this time. They occupied luxurious dwellings in Frankfort, Par is, and London. Only the aged Gudula stuck faithfully t o the family house in the Jewish quarter until her de ath in 1849 at the age of ninety-six.

When the fires had been quenche d at one spot they burst out at another on the broad con tinent of Europe. Attention was now directed to the Gre ek rising, and to the civil war in Spain, which had be en continuing since 1820. In this country, which had wrung a constitution fro m the king, the opposing forces of the Right and Left were still in conflict. During the summer of 1820 the radical members of the Cortes treated the king practically as a prisoner, and on June 22 of that year Ferdinand VII wrote to the King of France requesting him to send forces to his assistance, and also endeavored to induce th e other great powers to assist him against his own subjects . The idea of intervention did not appeal particularl y either to the King of France or to his chief minist er Count de Villele, although one party, that to which Chate aubri- and belonged, was very much in favor of it. The mat ter had come to be one that concerned the whole of Euro pe, and Metternich had grown accustomed to intervene de ci- sively in any important European crisis.

Metternich and Gentz accompanied th e emperor to Verona as they had to Laibach, and profi ting by their previous experience they took Solomon Roth s- child with them. For it was obvious that if it were decided at Verona to apply measures of compulsion t o Spain, the resources for this would have to be fort h- coming immediately. As the House of Rothschild had proved so useful in the case of Naples, it was desi red to make use of it if necessary on this occasion too . In the case of the congress at Laibach, Solomon had fe lt misgivings about leaving Vienna; but he made no dif fi- culties now. When Solomon arrived at Verona he learned from several representatives of the powers there of a ru mor abroad that the House of Rothschild had offered a l oan to the government which had come into power through the revolution, and which was threatening its own k ing, or that the Rothschilds had at any rate entered int o nego- tiations with this government. Such conferences may actually have taken place; but it was of the utmost importance to the Rothschilds that Metternich shoul d be reassured. He must not be left in any doubt as t o the fact that their House was lending its support only to the legitimists and the conservative regime. Solomon th ere- fore two days after his arrival at Verona hastened to write a letter to the chancellor refuting these rum ors: 1 \"Most gracious Chancellor,\" the letter ran. \"On my arrival at Verona I was amazed to learn that men of standing here believe that our House has contracted or intends to contract a loan with the Spanish governm ent.

He had had nothing whatever to do with any arrangements with Spain; hi s brothers certainly, especially Nathan who lived in lib- eral England, often did things which they did not i mme- diately communicate to the other brothers, and whic h these learned of only after the fait accompli; but on this occasion there had actually been no agreement concl uded with Spain. After handing his letter to Metternic h, Sol- omon called on Gentz. Alexander von Humboldt had just left him. Humboldt was attached to the King of Prussia's suite, and he had been discussing problem s of high philosophy with the \"Pen of Europe.\" In orde r to assure himself of Gentz's support during the congre ss, Rothschild held out to him the prospect of further profit- able transactions, and Gentz noted with satisfactio n in his diary that Rothschild had discussed with him \"matte rs which although not so high were far more pleasant.\" 2 During the whole period of the congress Solomon and Gentz had been inseparable, and both had derived th e greatest advantage from their association. Gentz intro- duced Solomon to the representatives of Russia, and the delegates of the tsar's dominions soon concluded a loan of £6,000,000. Apart from the business profit rea lized on this transaction, Solomon contrived to increase his per- sonal prestige. \"Rothschild and his Paris brother had the Order of Vladimir conferred on them yesterday,\" Gentz wrote 3 to Pilat the editor of the Oesterreichischer Beobac hter, which was the most widely read Viennese newspaper a t that time.

Even M et- ternich was not entirely in favor of it, and as war with Spain was therefore not expected 4 French securities kept rising in value. Suddenly, on the arrival of a cour ier from Verona, James Rothschild sold French bonds to the n om- inal value of five million francs. The following da y it became known that the banker Ouvrard, who was also staying at Verona, had concluded a loan with the Re gency Government, which had been set up by the supporters of absolute monarchy in Spain for the duration of Ferd i- n a n d ' s captivity. It was certainly natural to draw the inference that the congress was taking the side of the king, and a sha rp fall in brench bonds resulted. The capital of Franc e re- echoed with reproaches against ministers who had co n- stant l y averred that they were determined to avoid war with Spain. The slump became more and more acute, until, a few days later, the British ambassador got news from Vienna. It then became generally known that no decision had yet been taken, and Wellington was con - tinuing, on behalf of England, to oppose the propos al for intervention. The securities now began to go up, and the good news was confirmed by Rothschild. On November 18, Villele wrote to his representative at Verona to say: \"The Rothschilds' courier is causi ng our securities to rise again. He is spreading the new s that there will be no intervention. I do not believe in these deceptive booms, which entail fresh variations in t he rate of exchange and heavy losses to many persons, 5 especially when there may be a risk of war later.\" The House of Rothschild was thus using the general political situation for the purpose of doing profit able business because it was able to get news early.

A few days later, on November 26, Solomon planned to take adva n- tage of his brother James's presence in Verona, and go himself to Vienna. Gentz had just given him a secre t re- port on the congress, and several letters which he wanted taken to Vienna. But a post from Rome informed him that their brother Carl was shortly to arrive from Naples. Solomon postponed his journey for two days. The thr ee Rothschilds had thus an opportunity thoroughly to d is- cuss Neapolitan and Spanish affairs, and the probab le result of the congress. After this Solomon and Jame s returned home. At the beginning of the congress, Solomon had been sending so much news from Verona to Vienna that the bulky Rothschild postal-packets attracted the notic e of the postmaster at Scharding.

The relations between Austria and that House were constantly growing closer, and her leading statesme n were scarcely able to refuse any request put forward by one of its members. On September 30 the commercial department of the treasury received an application from Nathan, askin g to be appointed Austrian consul-general in London. He pointed out not only that he had punctiliously perf ormed the duties enumerated in his official instructions, especially in the matter of rendering assistance to Aus- trian seamen—doing so without asking for any compen - sation—but that he was the sole consular representa tive of a foreign power in London who had not the rank o f consul-general. 7 He promised not to relax his watch on Austrian commercial interests in the future, and al so most conscientiously to carry out any instructions which he should receive. The commercial department of the treasury strongly supported this application, and M etter- nich sent it forward to the emperor with the follow ing memorandum: \"The said Rothschild has for a considerable period occupied the office of Austrian consul in London, t o the general satisfaction of his chiefs, and in a disint erested spirit has carried out his duties often involving p ersonal sacrifices, from which he never shrank where the pr estige and the interests of your Majesty's service were in volved.

So Nathan now he ld the same position in London as his brother in Paris . That city was the center now of Rothschild enterprise. T he question of intervention in Spain was still the dom inating issue, and as in this matter England was sharply op posed to the conservative groups in Russia, Austria, and France, it was inevitable that there should be a correspond ing conflict of opinion within the House of Rothschild. Metternich, with his legitimist policy, had Solomon completely in tow; Amschel was not so prominent, bu | owing to the Jewish problem at Frankfort, he had to follow the direction indicated by his protector Met ter- nich, while James in Paris was so closely bound up with the leader of the ministry, Count de Villele, and a ntici- pated such advantages from this connection that he too was compelled to fall in with the conservative grou p, who were all-powerful on the Continent.

He had often been able to o blige influential persons in matters of finance, a fact w hich a s s i s t e d him in his efforts to consolidate his posi tion. Soon after his appointment as consul-general James had t aken the magnificent Palais Fouche formerly occupied by Napoleon's commissioner of police, and the magnific ent style in which he lived served to enhance his prest ige. He was still a bachelor, a fact that somewhat limited his social activities, but also made it easier for him to make his way into exclusive circles, some of which still showed great reluctance to admit the Jewish parvenu, and o nly did so when personal interests made it appear desir able. Conditions, however, gradually improved in this res pect as his wealth increased. James also benefited by th e fact that the great Paris bankers of that period such as Laffitte and Casimir Perier were either liberal, or indeed a lmost revolutionary, in their views, while others such as Del- essert, Mallet, and Hottinguer were too nervous to undertake risky ventures on a large scale. In 1823 James offered to place funds at the disposa l of Villele, and informed him that he was prepared t o come to his assistance in alleviating the financial embar- rassments of the treasury. James's first importan t trans- action with the French Treasury consisted in undert aking the sale of 6% Royal Bonds.

If the fall of the ministry could be brought about in some, other way, France might perhaps be induced to regar d this as indicating an improvement in the position a nd abstain from taking action.

On June 23, 1823, the duke had reached Cad iz and was prepared to launch his attack. The forts su r- rounding the city were speedily captured. The neces sity actually to take the town by storm did not arise. I n accordance with Villele's advice the duke made free with the Rothschilds' money; bills were drawn on Nathan Rothschild to the amount of nearly two million fran cs in favor of various members of the courts, and of the per- sons who held the king captive. When the military position at Cadiz had become hope - less, and those who had accepted bribes promoted mu tinies in the garrisons, the Cortes finally broke up, and released the king. It is true that he was first forced to si gn a document containing all kinds of promises for a mod erate form of government, in accordance with the constitu tion; but everybody knew perfectly well that he would not keep them. Thus the King of Spain was not in the en d required to feel under an obligation to the powerfu l sup- port of the House of Rothschild for his release fro m his own subjects of the liberal party. Neither was the duke forced to feel that he owed it to the banking firm that, after speedily overcoming all difficulties, he was enabled to return to Paris as a conquering hero.

Ferdinand's new absolute government had money troubles no less than its predecessor; and the king ap- pealed to the monarch of France, pointing out that his work was not yet completed, and that he lacked such a financial foundation as would be provided by a lo an. Villele applied to James Rothschild, who, in conjun ction with Nathan and the British bankers Baring and John Irving, offered a loan of 120,000,000 piasters 19 to be sub- scribed for at 60%. The bankers demanded, however, that the whole of Spain's Colonial revenue should b e mortgaged, this being the only revenue that had suf fered little through the civil war, and in addition they required that France should give a formal guarantee. An agreement was not concluded at the time, since V il- lele replied to the bankers 20 that his first consideration must be his duty toward France. He could not agree to a guarantee by France without endangering its polit ical and financial interests. He would, however, gladly advise the Spanish government to regularize its administra tion and to apply moderation in its general policy, in o rder to create the confidence necessary for such agreeme nts. These were fine words, but they offered no tangible secu- rity for calculating business men, and accordingly the bankers withdrew their offer. Metternich and Gentz had attentively watched the course of events. Rothschild's relations with Gentz had become, if possible, still more intimate, and the s incerity of Gentz's diary is attested by nothing more than b y the entries of the 6th and 9th of January, 1823: \"Roths child called on me in Vienna.

The brothers may have learned that the Austrian finance min- ister once more had occasion to think of them. Engl and had recently demanded the repayment of some old deb ts owing by Vienna, and it appeared that Solomon's and Nathan's services would be required again. Metterni ch and Gentz were therefore anxious to be obliging at this time, especially in matters that did not cost the s tate anything. They did not have to rack their brains to find an opportunity of showing their good-will, for to- gether with Borne, Solomon had been \"hammering at [Gentz] about this wretched question of the Frankfo rt Jews.\" 21 The growing power of the House of Rothschild, which had originated in Frankfort and now had dealings wi th most of the more important states, caused the Frank fort Jews to stiffen in their attitude. They now demande d as a right what they had formerly begged as a favor.

It is true that many restrictions were still maintained. Thus only fifteen Jewish marriages were allowed in each year; 23 no Jew was allowed to possess more than one house, and Jew- ish trade too was not free from all restrictions. T he Jews, however, were henceforth counted as \"Israelite citi zens\"; the ghetto was done away with, and they had full li berty of movement within the town. They regarded these concessions as a victory, and Rothschild gave a dinner to celebrate them Septembe r 3, to which he invited both burgomasters, as well as t he delegates to the diet. The former, however, again s tayed away because, as Schwemer said, they did not feel i n a mood for celebrations. 24 The debentures issued in 1811 under Dalberg's agreement for the liberation of the Jews were now fully redeemed. This fact also indicated t hat the Jews were satisfied. Thus the matters in disput e in the Jewish question, which had been pending for eight years, were finally settled by the diet acting in a judicial capacity. The principal credit for this was due to Rothschild.

Count Stadion had been nego- tiating with Rothschild and Parish, the underwriter s of the last Austrian loan, since the spring of 1822 fo r a loan to cover the estimated deficit of 20 million gulden . They had stated that they were willing to underwrite 20 mil- lions at 67, and then at 68.5%, but Count Stadion, whose recent experience in such matters had made him more cautious and critical, thought that these terms wer e not sufficiently favorable, or were, as he expressed it , \"oppres- sive.\" 25 He therefore looked around for other offers, and for the first time in the experience of the Aus trian government these were forthcoming. Stadion wanted to borrow only 12,000,000 gulden at first; he fixed the final date for submitting tende rs at April 14, 1822. The Paris banker Fould, representing a gr oup of Paris firms at the head of which was Laffitte, o ffered to underwrite the 12,000,000 at 69%. Parish and Rothsc hild made a second offer to take over the loan at 69 1/2 , while the Viennese banking firm of Geymuller offered 72 3 /4. A conference of ministers was summoned for April 13, to consider the tenders. Solomon Rothschild was particularly anxious to secu re the loan, if necessary without the cooperation of P arish— with whom he had recently had several differences—a s this would provide him with a further opportunity f or exploiting the advantages enjoyed by his firm for t he sale of securities through their branches in the most im portant markets in Europe. He learned through Gentz that ot her firms were not merely in the field but had actually offered better terms than his, and he therefore decided to write to Stadion. When the finance minister went to attend the confer ence on April 13, he was handed a letter from the firm o f Rothschild just before entering the conference room .

The conference first decided that 20 million gulden should be issued at once instead of the smaller amo unt that Stadion desired. It was then considered whethe r or not any attention should be paid to Rothschild's la te offer. The conference was agreed that Rothschild's letter was manifestly irregular. Applicants had been required to submit tenders under seal by April 12. Rothschild h ad done so jointly with Parish, but their offer had be en less favorable than that of Geymuller. The second letter , al- though dated April 12, had not been given to Stadio n until the following day. The minutes of the conference po inted out that \"the irregularity of this procedure consis ts in having failed to observe the final date imposed upo n all applicants for submitting their tenders—a fact whic h Rothschild is obviously trying to conceal by anteda ting his offer—and also in the lack of precision in the offer itself.\" Metternich and Count Zichy expressed the opinion th at Rothschild's offer should not be accepted, but that it should not be rejected either, and proposed that th e whole matter should be negotiated afresh. With regard to the French banker Laffitte, whom he suspected of libera l sympathies, Prince Metternich stated that he feared the banker might be actuated by other than purely busin ess motives. He added that he felt similar misgivings r egard - ing Geymuller's offer, since it was possible that h e was acting in concert with Laffitte. While Metternich used his influence in favor of the House of Rothschild, Stadion took the opposite line , ad- hering to his view that Rothschild's retrospective tender should be ignored, and that the offer of the firm o f Gey- muller should be accepted as the best offer sent in by the time fixed.

If in the present instance we act otherwise, it may be assumed that henceforth we shall have no possibilit y of securing genuine competition, and we may therefore pay dearly in time to come, for any immediate advantage .\" Finally, with reference to the objection made to La ffitte on personal grounds, Count Stadion observed that it would be quite impossible in any case to prevent hi m from being an unrevealed participator in a loan, an d that even if Rothschild's offer were accepted this conti ngency would still have to be reckoned with. As there was no way of bridging these differences o f opinion the conference broke up without result. It was therefore necessary for the emperor to give the fin al deci- sion, with the result that Metternich's views preva iled. The emperor issued the following decisions in counc il : 26 \"On the question whether 12 or 20 millions should b e issued, the general political situation should be r egarded as the determining factor, and Metternich should ac cord- ingly be consulted.

In April, 1823, the deficit up t o the end of the financial year 1824 was estimated at no less than 35,000,000 gulden. It was now decided to issue a lo an of 30,000,000.

The Opposition in t he British Parliament had for some time been reproachi ng the ministry for failing to demand payment of debts which had been incurred by Austria even before the revolu tion- ary war. Before the system of the English subsidies had come into effect, Austria had been granted two loans by Eng- land, to the value of £6,220,000 for financing its cam- paigns, and in the excitement of the Napoleonic war s, this fact had fallen into the background. With the addi- tion of compound interest the debt had, by the time of the Congress of Verona in 1822, risen to an amount exceed- ing £23,500,000. Austria had already been approache d at Aix-la-Chapelle regarding the repayment of the l oan, but Metternich had refused to pay, and all the nego tia- tions since had proved fruitless. 28 For Stadion definitely stated that if England insisted upon its demands it would mean the collapse of Austria's finances, which had been so laboriously resuscitated. 29 When Metternich adopted a policy at Verona which was opposed to that of England, Wellington again re - minded the chancellor that his government was press ing for the payment of this debt.

He then had recourse to Solomon Rothschild, asking him to t ry to influence the British government through his bro ther Nathan.

Emperor Francis drew his pen heavily through Zichy' s \"frill,\" and took \"cognizance with satisfaction\" of the fact that the matter had been settled. 34 The whole trans- action proved to be one of the most profitable piec es of business in which the House of Rothschild had ever engaged.

Villele thought out his scheme and then made a detailed proposal to James Rothschild in Paris. 40 The minister showed that in spite of the expense of the Spanish war, he could make his budget balance witho ut a further loan or additional taxation. \"In these ci rcum- stances,\" he wrote, \"it appears to me to be possibl e to take advantage of the conditions that have caused public securities in England and throughout Europe to appr e- ciate in value, for the purpose of carrying through the conversion of our 5% bonds into 4 or 3% bonds.\" Villele asked James to cooperate in this plan, whic h was not to affect French credit. He meant in this w ay to convert no less than 150 million bearing 5% inte rest, and to issue to the underwriters a corresponding am ount of 3% bonds at 75. The minister hoped that the 3% b onds would also soon rise in value; and he offered to al low the underwriters to keep the saving in interest during the first year after the conversion of the bonds bearing 150 million in annual interest had been effected. James immediately informed his brother Nathan in London of the French finance minister's proposal fo r this gigantic transaction.

His connection with the British governm ent also made him the most influential of all the broth ers. The finance minister not only had sent his proposal to James in writing, but also had repeatedly discussed it with him personally, and immediately after such dis cus- sions, on the 2nd, 3rd and 4th of March, 1824, Jame s sent a private courier to his brother Nathan in London. On March 6, Nathan, after consulting with the banker B ar- ing, sent James the following reply: 41 \"M Y DEAR BROTHER : ... the brothers Baring, as well as I myself, will be pleased to be of use to the Frenc h gov- ernment in their plans for reducing the interest pa yments; and as the scheme seems to have been well thought o ut, there should not be much cause to fear for the resu lt. At the same time, it is absolutely essential that the finance minister should be in complete agreement with us, and that no difficulties should arise in carrying o ut his intentions. \"It is quite clear that the present price of the bo nds is maintained by speculators who have been exceedingly lucky for some time, and will no doubt continue to de- velop their success by further speculating on a ris e. Such persons, however, have not the power to assist the finance minister in a scheme embracing such far-reaching po ssi- bilities, unless it be supported by such eminent ca pitalists as Messrs. Baring and Rothschild. I am sending you the draft of a scheme which I should like to have submi tted to the minister, and the success of which would und oubt- edly be of enormous importance to the country and t o the government.\" In this drafted scheme Nathan explained that the finance minister would have first of all to secure the chamber's consent to the operation, the government being allowed a completely free hand to carry through in the most advantageous way possible, as was done in simi lar cases by the British Parliament.

The minister must persuade the ban k to discount at 3%, and also to lend money on the bonds . \"His Majesty will thus be in a position when the ch am- ber reassembles, to inform his subjects and the who le world of the flourishing condition of French financ es, and that, too, directly after a war which has restored the Spanish Bourbons to their throne and to the hearts of their people. . . .\" If the whole operation were to go through successfu lly, and if 150 million of annual interest charges were really to be cut down from 5% to 3%, the saving effected b y the French government would run into many millions, and the House of Rothschild was to receive the benefit of the first annual saving thus made. Villele and the two firms soon arrived at an agreem ent Nathan had applied his experience in British transa ctions of a similar nature, and the whole matter had now t o be submitted to the public.

Meanwhile the bonds had been driven up to a still higher figure, reaching 104 and 106. Each man fel t him- self threatened in the possession of this valuable paper, and a storm artificially raised by Villele's enemie s broke out. This was increased by making enormous play o f the government's statement that the former emigres shou ld be compensated out of these savings. Vincent, the Aus- trian ambassador in Paris, reported that these oper ations would furnish the banking powers with fresh fields of gain, and that their avarice would lead them to sug gest similar plans to all other governments. The scheme met with harsh criticism in all quarters , the most devastating being contained in a report fr om Par i s to Metternich, which concluded with the words : \"The rentiers are wild with indignation, but Villel e will attempt nevertheless to carry the thing through, fo r he is a minister quand meme.\" 42 The king was so upset that he did not dare to show himself in the streets of Paris, fearing demonstrat ions by the small bondholders. Nevertheless, at the expense of his popularity he consistently supported the plans and intentions of his prime minister. There were exceedingly severe critics of the role which the House of Rothschild played on this oc ca- sion. Ouvrard attacked them with special severity in his memoirs. 43 As, however, he belonged to the party which was hostile to the Rothschilds, his statements can be accepted only with reservations. There was no imm edi- ate prospect of the House of Rothschild making eith er profit or loss, for the proposals were carried in t he lower house by a very small majority, while the members o f the upper house, most of whom had strong personal inter est as bondholders, rejected the proposal on July 3, at the instigation of Chateaubriand.

His constant busine ss dealings with the finance minister, Medici, resulte d in their getting on very good terms in spite of the pa yments to Austria. While on the one hand the Rothschilds assured Austria of their anxiety to see the state p aid by Naples, Carl protested to Medici that he would do everything he possibly could to lessen the burden t hat Naples had to bear. The results soon became appar- ent; Medici began to examine and criticize the acco unts sent in by Austria for the maintenance of the troop s.

He suggested that in that cas e Medici would not have had time to examine Austria's disbursements so closely. \"The real reason,\" he stated in a report to Vienna, \"that he is induced to increase his demands, and to make diffi- culties, lies in the fact that he obviously knows o f the savings that we are effecting; as Rothschild is tra nsmit- ting them to Vienna, we may practically assume that Medici is bound to know of them, for Rothschild's s taff is in too close touch with Medici's for this to be avoided. \"It would have been better to leave this business t o the quartermaster's department of the army, as was done in the case of the first occupation of Naples; in t hat case nobody would have known the amounts that we transmi t to Vienna, and we would also have saved the charges which we pay to the House of Rothschild.

But the ki ng feared the outbreak of another revolution; and as h e did not trust his own soldiers, he attempted to recruit Swiss regiments. These negotiations came to nothing becau se of the expense of raising the troops. The king then proceeded to recruit in Ireland. The brothers Rothschild had very skilfully introduced t his idea to him. Great disturbances had broken out in t hat country as a result of the wretched conditions unde r which the poor peasantry, oppressed by their landlords, w ere living. Nathan had come into contact with an Irishm an, the Irish London banker Callaghan, who thought that the British government would also be in favor of such r ecruit- ing, as it would draw off dissatisfied and poverty- stricken elements of the population. Nathan saw the opportun ity of killing three birds with one stone: he would be render- ing a service to the English government by divertin g a troublesome element; to the Ring of Naples by provi d- ing the neutral troops that he so much wanted; and, in addition, he would do good business for himself.

Callaghan stated emphatically that the overpopulation of Ireland, where it was scarcel y pos- sible to keep body and soul together, was at the ro ot of all the trouble, and that it was positively desirab le that some of the population should emigrate. Carl Rothschild handed the letter to the minister Medici, telling him of Nathan's proposal. Medici ha s- tened to inform the king of both these facts, the k ing's one wish being to have at last some sense of securi ty. Shortly afterwards King Ferdinand fell ill, and die d on January 4, 1825. He was succeeded by Francis I, who was personally no less frivolous and extravagan t than his predecessor, and was far from possessing a strong character. Under his rule the state of the kingdom tended to get worse rather than to improve. He too had rea son to feel anxious about his personal safety, and in 1 825 it was decided to recruit four Swiss regiments for Nap les, and the Irish project was discarded.

Meanwhile James was actively engaged in negotiation s in Paris for a new Spanish loan, which the Madrid g ov- ernment wanted to put through at any price.

For - going his honeymoon, immediately after the marriage , James had to return to Paris as his brothers Carl a nd Solomon were there, carrying on discussions with th e Spanish negotiators. The three brothers decided that one of them should go to Nathan in London with a Spanish plenipotentiary, and ask him to try to persuade the House of Baring to p ar- ticipate in the loan. The Rothschilds, however, de- manded that the seventy-two millions which Spain ow ed to France for her intervention should be included i n the loan; to this proposal the Spanish government raise d ob- jections. As the Rothschilds in any case had little confi- dence in Spanish conditions, and tried in vain to s ecure a guarantee from other powers, the negotiations on this occasion also came to nothing. On September 16, 1824, King Louis XVIII died. His brother, the former leader of the conservatives, su cceeded to the throne as Charles X. He was already sixty-se ven years old, and firmly convinced of the necessity of still more definite reactionary measures, as well as bein g full of religious intolerance.

In this connection the suggestion made by a Milan p ost- master is illuminating. \"I have often noticed,\" he re- ported to Vienna, 48 \"that the Rothschild clerks who travel as couriers from Naples to Paris about once or twic e a month take with them all the dispatches of the Fren ch, English, and Spanish ministers, accredited in Naple s, Rome, and Florence.

He was thoroughly familiar with the manner in which correspondence wa s tampered with, and used this knowledge for making a violent attack upon Metternich and Solomon Rothschi ld. He even went so far as to state 50 that Metternich had, in agreement with Solomon, waited at Fischamend, tw o stages from Vienna, for a post bearing important ne ws from Constantinople, and held it up for two days. \"This was done to gain time in order to have two or three days to rig the market, and to make some hund reds of thousands for the chancellor, Zichy, and the res t of the pack of thieves, with the German fortress caret aker 50a Rothschild, the King of the Jews and the Jew of Kin gs, at their head.\" As far as Metternich's relations with Rothschild we re concerned, these exceedingly offensive allegations were far from the facts; but it certainly was possible, through holding back news received by courier, to gain time for profitable deals on the exchange, and this was no d oubt done."},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"The Rothschild Business Throughout the World 319 The firm of Rothschild, which had now literally at- tained world-wide dimensions, was to enter upon a d iffi- cult period. The long years of peace which England was enjoying led that country to seek profitable invest ment for the enormously increased wealth which it had acquir ed since the successful termination of the Napoleonic wars. There was also an increasing tendency to unsound sp ecu- lation, and a flood of new flotations. As the Centr al and South American republics freed themselves of Spanis h dominion, they seemed to offer desirable opportunit ies for doing business in agricultural produce and mines. At the end of 1824. there was feverish activity in the City. Companies sprang up like mushrooms, and mil- lions of pounds in cash were subscribed. Almost all the principal London firms took part in this movement; 51 but the Barings and Rothschild, who regarded it as unna tural and artificial, held aloof. The year 1825 proved th at they were right. The South American mining ventures collapsed, and numerous undertakings apparently on a solid foundation experienced the same fate, in a cr isis that was becoming more and more general, and was spreading from London to the whole of Europe.

In spite of the cha nge in the general situation, the French minister Villele had adhered to his conversion scheme, and although the Rothschilds were much less enthusiastic about it th an they had been a year ago, James was so closely bound up with the French minister that when Villele took the sche me up again in May, 1825, he could not stand entirely aloof. He certainly did not conceal his misgivings. While Metternich was in Paris, James openly said to him t hat it was wrong of Villele to resume the operation at that time. 53 James was more explicit in the following state-"},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"The Rothschild Business Throughout the World 321 ment to the Austrian ambassador, Baron von Vincent: \"There are times when such an operation may be oppo r- tune. Last year the finance minister was assured of the success of his scheme; he was supported by powerful firms, and a large volume of English money was avai lable for investment in France, but now it is flowing int o other channels. The return of the capital sums that find their way to America is only partial, and much slower. Mo st of the banking operations in Europe are not carried through on a cash basis, but this is not the case i n America. The . . . operations of Mr. Huchinson in England ar e moreover exactly contrary to those of M. de Villele . When one also considers the constant complaints in the press which bring the measures proposed by the mini stry into bad odor, one cannot but fear that it will fin d itself deprived of the necessary resources.\" 54 Villele, however, was not to be restrained. He suc- ceeded this time in carrying his proposals in the u pper chamber as well, and he proceeded to put his long-c her- ished plans into operation. The Rothschilds could n ot exclude themselves from the scheme, but they went i nto it very cautiously. The Paris market was reacting t o the fall in prices in England, and as success was l argely dependent upon a boom in French securities, the pro s- pects were far from propitious. James remarked to Vincent on July 7, that it was a long time since he had seen the Paris market so dull. He shared the antagonism of a certain party toward M. de Villele, and he said it was certainly not his fault that the House of Rothschild was regarded as seriously c om- promised in having supported the government. 55 This was a dig at Nathan, because James was a little jea lous of Nathan's outstanding reputation. The difficulties of the whole undertaking were in- creased through the public opposition of the author ities at the Bank of France.

James wa s, however, not altogether confident that he was right in taking up an attitude opposed to the operation. The matter might succeed in the end, and in that case J ames would have suffered a humiliating reverse. He accor d- ingly thought it advisable to say 56 to Vincent as early as June 8, that in spite of the bank's hostility to Villele and to the House of Rothschild, matters could still be arranged, and Villele's plan would yet succeed. Somewhat later, after the chambers had accepted the draft bills, James for a time saw everything in glo wing colors, and wrote a letter to Metternich expressing his changed views : 57 ''You may now be assured that Villele has won his case. The bonds will be a great success , and he will defeat all his opponents because he is righ t.\" On June 18, Solomon, who was also staying in Paris, made the following statement: \"I am now able to say that notwithstanding all the vigorous attacks to wh ich M. de Villele has been subjected hitherto, and is stil l being subjected, in my view, his financial scheme will go through; and the count, who enjoys his Majesty's co nfi- dence to an exceptional degree, will be strengthene d in his position; while the enemies of peace and of the minis- try will be deprived for a long time yet of the ple asure of seeing it fall.\" 58 Metternich condemned this remarkable change of opinion with the remark: \"In Paris Rothschild said to me that Villele was wrong. It is often so with the world's judgment.\" 59 James's first view had really been the right one. T he general financial situation throughout the world di d not in fact admit of such an operation's being carried through at that time. The government succeeded only in con- verting 30 millions to 3% bonds, and these quickly fell from 75 to 62 and 63.

They admitted 60 that they had not reckoned with the possibility of such an unexpectedly sudden fall. The four brothers finally went to consult the family oracle Nathan, in London, wit h a view to taking energetic measures to save the situa tion. Villele's conversion scheme, however, could not be im- proved in any essential now. Even the 5% bonds were quoted some points under par at the end of the year . All they could hope to do was to limit their losses , and in this they succeeded to a certain extent; but the wh ole affair was an unfortunate piece of business. In other, more distant fields also, the Rothschilds had not been over-lucky in their investments during tha t year. After several fruitless attempts at reconquer ing Haiti, the second largest island of the Antilles, i t had to be surrendered by France, on the payment of an indemnity of 150,000,000 francs by the new republic an government. This government borrowed the necessary money, the loans being taken up by a French syndica te, including Rothschild and Laffitte. The Republic of Haiti was never able to meet its obligations; and e ven though the French government eventually indemnified the two firms for their losses, the transaction had to be put down as unprofitable. Whether the brothers Rothschild were fortunate or unfortunate in their dealings, their names were on every- body's lips; legends gathered around their activiti es and their wealth, and they were accredited with the mos t fabulous schemes by the general public. Thus the st ory gained currency in Austria that Rothschild had one day demanded the immediate repayment in convention coin - age, of no less than 40 million gulden which he had lent the state. On being told that it was impossible to repay this sum, Rothschild was alleged to have proposed t hat he should either be handed over the whole customs r ev- enue throughout the imperial dominion for a certain"},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"324 The Rise of the House of Rothschild period, or be granted the monopoly of the purchase of fleece in the Austrian dominions, whereby he would have been able to dictate the price of textiles. Althoug h these rumors were obviously untrue, they indicated the es tima- tion of the power of the House held by the public, whether it was well or ill disposed. The Rothschilds were becoming the central figures i n the jokes and caricatures of comic papers. In 1825 a caricature making fun of their versatility was circ ulated in Frankfort and South Germany. The drawing showed a Rothschild on horseback, with samples of all his busi- nesses; wine-casks, seeds, buttons, etchings, state securi- ties, umbrellas, pens, magic lanterns, etc., on his way from the north to the south of Europe. The easily interp reted legend ran: \"Blueshield, commercial traveler, does business in all branches of trade.\" 61 The brothers did in fact engage in every conceivabl e kind of venture, and they were approached with all sorts of schemes. Persons in high places especially had r e- course to them for loans. Among them was Marshal de Marmont, Duke of Ragusa, formerly governor in Illyria under Napoleon I. He had joined the Bourbon s after Napoleon's fall, and got on good terms with M et- ternich. As a reward for his change of allegiance a nd various political services, he was granted an annui ty of fifty thousand francs by the Austrian government, i n alleged compensation for a donation allotted to him by Napoleon I. The marshal had again got into serious financial difficulties, and the French government, which did not wish him to be publicly compromised, advise d him to mortgage his Austrian annuity to Rothschild if the banker would put his affairs in order. The duke did apply to Solomon Rothschild, but Sol- omon wanted first to make sure that the Austrian go vern- ment would actually pay Marmont the annuity until h e died. He therefore wrote to Metternich: \"I would no t have entered into any negotiations in this matter w ithout"},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"The Rothschild Business Throughout the World 325 having previously asked your Highness's consent, ha d I not done so at the suggestion of Count de Villele. ...

Everything would be simple, \"as long as the respect ive positions of the persons concerned remained the sam e.\" This was rather a dangerous reply, and Solomon wanted to have various, and, as Marmont called them , \"ridiculous\" guarantees. 65 Rothschild, however, firmly adhered to the position that the Austrian governmen t must give her full expressed consent to the arrange ment, if he entered into it. \"I am fully aware,\" Marmont wrote, \"that this re- quirement is not flattering to me, and that the onl y motive for making it is to obtain guarantees against the p ossi- bility of my mauvaise foi.\" But for fear of endange r- ing the arrangement, he had to agree. In November, 1825, the contract was submitted, con- stituting a speculation on the part of Rothschild t hat the marshal, who was fifty years old, would live a long time. Metternich, however, would not agree that Emperor Francis should give his express consent, as contemp lated under the contract, because it was impossible to kn ow in the case of a former marshal of Napoleon whether hi s political opinions would not undergo changes such a s"},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"326 The Rise of the House of Rothschild might cause Austria to cease her payments. If, howe ver, these payments were mortgaged to Rothschild for the full term of the marshal's life, it would not be possibl e to discontinue them. The contract was therefore not co n- cluded, and in order not to rebuff Villele, James l ent the marshal a small sum on the security of the next instal- ment of his pension. On April 30, 1827, Solomon wrote the following lett er to Metternich 66 : \"Your Highness will perceive from the enclosed statement that Marshal de Marmont's af fairs are in a state of the greatest confusion, and he is hard pressed by his creditors. He is bound to go bank rupt sooner or later, and in such a case our Paris branc h would be a creditor to the extent of fifteen thousand fra ncs, ad- vanced to the marshal on the security of the person al annuity payable to him by the imperial government. There is only one way in which my firm can be secur ed against possible loss, and that is by impounding th e two next instalments of this annuity. I therefore ve nture most humbly to request your Highness to issue the n eces- sary authorization for the I. and R.

B ut Solomon was in a position to take this liberty, sin ce Metternich himself was again negotiating a personal loan with the firm; and in fact on June 1, 1827, the pri nce received a loan of half a million gulden from the R oths- childs.

It seems to me that M. Renevier, the manager of the Madrid branch, has gone rather too far in what he h as said to the Spanish government.

Nathan had advised against it because for political reasons he did not wish the reactionary Spanish government to be supported. Metternich on the other hand would have been please d by the granting of a loan, and desired it to go thr ough. \"So far as I have been able to ascertain,\" Vincent re- ported to the chancellor, 68 \"the House of Rothschild is not much inclined to have anything to do with a finan- cial venture in Spain.

Offers of business from governing circles flowed in on them from all quarters. Carl Rothschild had met C ount Louis Philippe de Bombelles in connection with some payments which he was instructed by the Austrian go v- ernment to make on the Neapolitan account for the p as- sage of Austrian troops through Tuscany. Althoug h large sums were involved the matter was p romptly settled, and the Tuscan government gave him to unde r- stand that it would take the opportunity of demonst rating its satisfaction. Grand Duke Leopold II, who had been ruler of Tuscany since 1824, was at that time considering a scheme of great benefit to his subjects, namely, to drain the Maremme, an area of marsh land in Tuscany embracing thousands of square miles. The grand duke propose d to Carl Rothschild through Bombelles that he should undertake a part of the drainage operation on his o wn account, subject to a suitable arrangement with the state of Tuscany. Such was the esteem in which the Hou se was then held for its versatility and financial res ources. Carl Rothschild did not feel that he could undertak e such a far-reaching scheme. \"Would it not be bett er,'' he replied to Bombelles, 69 \"if the Tuscan government which has conceived such benevolent plans for their sub- jects, would itself supervise the carrying out of the scheme with the assistance of a loan to be taken up grad- ually as the work progressed? Such a method of pr oce- dure seems to me to be more advantageous than to en trust the work to foreigners who do not know the country, and who would be compelled at great expense first to fi nd and engage workmen.\" These discussions took place in August, 1825, a mos t unfavorable time for persuading the Rothschilds, wh o"},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"The Rothschild Business Throughout the World 329 were uneasy at their losses, to agree to such a ser ious undertaking. The scheme nevertheless was carried through, and the firm took some part in financing i t, al- though it had nothing to do with the work itself.

The relations of the House of Rothschild with Met- ternich had remained untroubled throughout the year 1825; and the Rothschilds actually ventured to inte rcede with the chancellor regarding the affairs of certai n mem- bers of Napoleon's family. Toward these Metternich was in general anything but well disposed, and was alwa ys inclined to put the greatest difficulties in their way. Napoleon's mother, the aged Laetitia, who was then sev- enty-five years old, lived at Rome, and dearly wish ed to see again her eldest son Joseph, the former King of Spain, who was living in North America under the pseudonym of Count de Survilliers. Mother and son had not see n one another for ten years. Joseph had repeatedly at - tempted to get a passport, but the Austrian and Fre nch governments would not permit him to return to Europ e. All entreaties had hitherto been in vain, and a fri end of the family, Count Villeneuve, approached Solomon Rothschild, asking him to use his influence with Me tter- nich, because the old lady was ill, and Joseph prom ised to return to America immediately after his visit. T he world had indeed passed through great changes durin g the previous ten years when the son of a despised F rank- fort tradesman was asked to intercede on behalf of the man who was once deemed all-powerful. 70 Metternich, however, remained obdurate. To yield would not have been in accordance with the general prin- cipies of his policy.

Althoug h when interference with his policy was involved Meti er- nich might remain absolutely firm, he often gave th e House of Rothschild much too much rope in matters o f finance; and in such instances he relied upon the f inance minister and the treasury. An accident has revealed the details of a transacti on which clearly shows that Metternich and his assista nts sometimes went too far in their reliance on the Rot hs- childs; and an examination of this incident offers an opportunity of noting the treasury's own comments o n its mistakes and on the loss involved, which, it sh ould be pointed out, was incurred under Count Stadion's suc - cessor. Since the first Austrian occupation of Naples in 18 15, the kingdom had had to pay a war indemnity. Since t he end of 1818, it had been the duty of the Austrian a mbas- sador at Naples, Prince Ludwig de Jablonovski, to receive the instalments as they were paid in each m onth, and, in connection with a banking syndicate control led by the Neapolitan firm Dollfuss, to arrange for the ir transmission to Vienna. Everything went well at the start, but the bill for the second instalment was p rotested in Vienna, because the firm of Dollfuss was in diff iculties a Dollfuss reported this fact to Jablonovski in Janua ry, 1819, but the ambassador had already received the orders on the Neapolitan Treasury for the following in- stalments up to March and drawn these sums in advan ce. Jablonovski was now in danger of losing this money, and was forced to accept a very unfavorable settlement offered by the firm of Dollfuss, under which they handed hi m public securities, for the sum they held, at 87, th e price at which they had bought them, although these securiti es had by then fallen to 78. Jablonovski hoped that th ey would appreciate again, so that he would avoid any loss. \"The power,\" Jablonovski remarked later, \"whi ch"},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"The Rothschild Business Throughout the World 331 autocratically governs quotations throughout Europe , so that the most careful calculations go astray, the a uto- cratic power of the House of Rothschild was a facto r of which I was not then aware.\" 71 Jablonovski had miscalculated. The bonds continued to fall, and the prince was unable to make the paym ents to Vienna on the due dates, because he felt he coul d not sell the bonds at such a loss. He therefore mortgag ed them at 60% in order to be able to send at any rate part of the money, and still hoped that they would apprecia te. Later on, however, the remittances to Vienna ceased alto- gether. This greatly annoyed and worried Stadion, w ho needed the money. As an imperial ambassador, who wa s under Metternich's orders, was affected, Stadion co m- plained to the chancellor, and Metternich had to tr y to think of a way out. Again he had recourse to the br others Rothschild, a constant refuge in distress. It was i n the summer of 1819, and James and Carl had just come to Vienna from Naples. They had informed themselves as to conditions there, reported to Prince Metternich and been commissioned by him 72 to undertake the transmis- sion of Austria's outstanding claims in Naples. Rothschild stated that he would be delighted to car ry the matter through in collaboration with Gontard at the \"most favorable possible rates,\" and asked for 1/2% com- mission and 1/2% brokerage. \"You may be assured,\" his offer concluded, 73 \"that we shall do everything in our power to carry out your commands with all the d ili- gence and economy of which we are capable, so that we shall continue to justify the confidence which you place in us.\" The matter was accordingly entrusted to t hem. Prince Jablonovski had not yet been told anything about the negotiations with Rothschild, and he was ex- ceedingly upset when he was suddenly instructed to hand the business over. He expressed his astonishment, especially in view of the fact that he had meanwhil e arranged a solution of the matter with the finance min-"},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"332 The Rise of the House of Rothschild ister Medici by direct shipments of gold to Trieste . 74 \"But,\" he wrote, \"Herr James Rothschild was in Napl es, and presumably heard of my unfortunate dealings wit h the firm of Dollfuss, and determined to turn them t o his own advantage. Nothing else can explain how the Hou se of Rothschild should have taken over such an unimpo rt- ant business in a center with which they are not fa miliar, where the rate of exchange is constantly varying an d unfavorable, or how they could have persuaded the I. and R. Treasury to renounce the advantages of tr ans- porting gold, and to bear the considerable loss of exchange.\" In any case the matter was taken out of Jablonovski 's hands, and his suggestion that further payments sho uld be deferred until the Neapolitan bonds rose again w as ignored. In January, 1820, Jablonovski received i nstruc- tions to hand over all documents regarding the matt er to a controller specially sent to Naples for this purp ose. In July, 1820, the revolution broke out, and in the sp ring of 1821 the Austrian troops entered Naples. The immed iate effect of these events upon the bonds was unfavorab le, and they fell continuously until May, 1821. The resul t was that Stadion, who was always liable to sudden panic s, hastily gave instructions that the bonds which had been mortgaged at 60% should be sold to Rothschild, and this was done in May, 1821, at the lowest point which th ey touched, namely 58 1/8. The following year saw an extraordinary rise in Nea - politan securities, so that it may be readily imagi ned that the House of Rothschild made an enormous profit out of this purchase. This became particularly apparent when in August, 1827, the new finance minister Count Nad asdy, after going through these accounts, declared that P rince Jablonovski was liable to make good an amount of 58 4,- 354.54 florins, and created a charge over his prope rty at Rogozno for this amount. The prince protested strongly with the result that an"},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"The Rothschild Business Throughout the World 333 imperial commission was appointed to investigate th e matter. This investigation led to some lamentable r eve- lations as far as Austrian public finances were con cerned. The \"most obedient loyal servant Count von Taaffe,\" president of the treasury, had some utterly devasta ting statements to make in his most submissive report 75 re- garding the treasury's claims on the prince. He rev ealed that the transaction had been most unprofitable in every way, and declared that Prince Jablonovski's stateme nt that it would have been better for him and for the treas ury to have burned the certificates of the mortgage bon ds, and rid himself of them completely, was correct, ha rsh though it sounded. For as the bonds 76 had been mort- gaged for 60, and had later been transferred to Rot hschild at 58 1/8, the Austrian state had not merely failed to re- ceive anything further, but had actually had to mak e up the difference. Jablonovski's proposal to hold the bonds, and wait until they improved in value before realiz ing them, had been a sound business speculation. Instea d of this they had been handed over to the House of Roth s- child, together with the interest payments for the first half of the year 1828. On this memorandum an imperial instruction was issued, ordering the finance minister to examine th e ac- counts again in collaboration with Prince Jablonovs ki, and if the results showed that any added compensati on had to be paid, to take the necessary steps to coll ect the amount as speedily as possible. The fianance minist er carried out these instructions; and the report on t he matter concluded with the following words: \"The assessor appointed for the investigation is of the opinion t hat, although there is in a general way ... an obligatio n on the prince to make good the amount, the claim could be effectively resisted in the courts or otherwise. Fo r we are not at all likely to succeed in replying to an orde r to show cause, such as will necessarily be granted if the c harge created [on the prince's property] is not canceled. \""},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"334 The Rise of the House of Rothschild The result of the further examination was that inst ead of being held liable for the amount of more than ha lf a million florins, the prince was finally required to pay only 10,694 florins 34 kronen, in order that the co mplete failure of the treasury might be somewhat concealed from the outside world. The facts which had thus been brought to light also gave the chancellor food for thought, and he afterw ards observed a certain amount of caution in his relatio ns with the House of Rothschild. They availed themselves of every occasion to make the sovereign and the leadin g statesmen forget such untoward occurrences, and end eav- ored to obliterate the bad impression by giving pro of of their deepest devotion. This was especially the cas e when Emperor Francis fell ill in the spring of 1826 , re- covering only after many weeks of sickness. The who le of Europe had been in suspense, for the decease of the em- peror would have involved profound political change s; and the news of his recovery offered an opportunity for the brothers Rothschild to send their congratulatio ns to Metternich. It is true that they little guessed how clev- erly he had provided for the continuance of his con trol of affairs, even in the event of Emperor Francis's death. It will suffice to quote the letter which Amschel w rote from Frankfort: I have by today's post received the news of the fortunate recovery of his Majesty our universally beloved emperor.

And may it ever be my fortune in deepest reverence to call myself your Highness's most humble and most obedient servant, A MSCHEL M EYER VON R OTHSCHILD . 77 Now that the emperor had recovered, the fear that his death would deal a blow to Metternich's regime, and therefore also to the position which the brothers R oths- child had established in the I. and R. chancellor's office, was again remote. Solomon, who through Metternich and Gentz was constantly winning his way in Viennes e court circles, was frequently invited to the chance llor's and also often entertained him in his own house. One after another, families of the high aristocracy , re- quiring financial assistance, procured loans from t he Frankfort banker who had settled at Vienna. In this way he placed many aristocrats under an obligation to h imself, and whether they liked it or not they had to admit Solo- mon and his family to their exclusive salons. Thus both socially and in business Solomon climbed to dizzy heights at Vienna, and his commercial rivals began to become painfully aware of this, especially during t he years of financial crisis of 1825 and 1826. The firm Fries & Co., one of the four \"monopolistic state bankers\" which had come into prominence durin g the reign of Maria Theresa, had got into difficulti es dur- ing the crisis of 1825.

Being unable to meet his liabilities he had no othe r course open but to require his most powerful patron s such as Metternich and Gentz, who were at the same time his debtors, to repay their loans. He thus for feited their favor, though he could not save his firm from ruin. When he saw that the crash was inevitable Parish pu t an end to his life by jumping into the Danube; but before doing so he wrote two bitter letters expressing his resent- ment at the fact that the House of Rothschild had e l- bowed him out of many transactions. He blamed Mette r- nich for having sacrificed him to the cupidity of a family who had succeeded better than he had in securing th e chancellor's interest. He described the brothers Ro ths- child in a letter to Metternich as \"heartless perso ns, only interested in their money-bags, who, standing under the special protection of Metternich, have behaved in a most ungrateful manner to him.\" 78 Just before his death, Parish also wrote to Solomon Rothschild, reproaching him for having squeezed him out, although he had in 1817 introduced him to the big French and Austrian financial business. Now it has been ascertained that the Rothschilds would have succeed ed in establishing this connection even without Parish, a nd that he invited them to join in several transactions sim ply be- cause he was not sufficiently rich and powerful to carry through these great state financial operations alon e. On the other hand there is no doubt that the brothe rs Rothschild were entirely ruthless in competing with the firm of Fries and Parish, and that they succeeded a s no one else did in consolidating their position with t he public departments.

He spen t many hours discussing the tragedy with Metternich and Ge ntz, in its various aspects. Two rivals had been disposed of, but life went on i ts course, and it appeared desirable to wipe out their mem- ory, and to anticipate evil tongues by cleverly giv ing pub- licity to news regarding the fame, the business dea lings, and the prestige of the House of Rothschild. The br oth- ers had long recognized that good advertisement, wh ich owing to the limitations of the time had to be of a literary nature, could be of the greatest value. Through the ir influence with the authorities, who were able to us e the power of the censorship in order more or less to re strain press activities in all countries, they had little to fear from violent attacks in the press; and if any such oc- curred, they were almost always able to take effect ive countermeasures. Moreover, they had ample means at their disposal for influencing cowardly papers, and pressing the cleverest pens into their service. First and foremost there was Gentz, the \"Secretary of Europe.\" He had for a long time been writing propa- ganda articles for the Rothschilds in various paper s, and exerting his influence—backed as it was by the powe rful figure of Metternich looming behind him—upon the co n- temporary press in their favor. Gentz's growing int i- macy with the House of Rothschild, which was marked by constant invitations to dinners and theatres, as well as by \"highly welcome financial transactions with the excel- lent Rothschild,\" as faithfully recorded by Gentz, 79 gave a chance for carrying out a master-stroke of public ity. In 1826 the Brockhaus publishing firm was just abou t to publish a new edition of its Conversational Ency clope- dia, which had a very wide circulation at that time , and was regarded as an absolute gospel. The Rothschilds had not yet been featured in it, and it seemed to offer a con- venient opportunity for describing the origin and p rog- ress of their House."},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"338 The Rise of the House of Rothschild There was nobody better qualified to execute this, as re- garded both manner and matter, than Gentz. Solomon Rothschild accordingly requested him in return for a princely fee, to undertake the task, explaining to him the points he wished to have emphasized. He was particu - larly anxious that the relationship with the Electo r of Hesse should be described in such a way as to conve y the impression that the whole of his enormous fortune h ad been entrusted to the management of the House of Ro ths- child; and that they had succeeded in saving it by risking all their possessions. Special emphasis was to be l aid upon their integrity and disinterestedness, and the firm was to be described as more powerful than any conte m- porary firm, all the titles and dignities that the five broth- ers had acquired in the course of time being enumer ated. During the first week of April, 1826, Gentz wrote a n essay entitled \"Biographical Notes about the House of Rothschild,\" which was to serve as the basis of his article in the encyclopedia. The following extracts will gi ve an idea of the way in which Gentz carried out his task . The essay was accepted at its face value by very large numbers of people, and after appearing in the Brockhaus pub lica- tion was incorporated into similar foreign works, a s for instance Encyclopedic des gens du monde. The articl e ran: The Rothschilds, at the present time the greatest of all business firms, are among those who have achieved greatness and prosperity simply through intelligently taking advantage of opportunities which were available for thousands of others, through a spirit of enterprise seasoned by calm jud g- ment, and through their understanding of men and affairs, and their capacity to adjust themselves to the conditions of the time.

The rel a- tionship which Rothschild established with the Land - grave, afterwards Elector, of Hesse was a deci- sive factor in the enormous subsequent development of his business. The elector appointed him crown agent in 1801, having come to realize that he was a s reliable as he was useful. When in 1806 the French occupied the elector's territories, and he himself was compelled to flee, he left the rescue of his privat e possessions to Rothschild, their value amounting to many million gulden. It was only by sacrificing the whole of his own property, and at considerable per- sonal risk, that Rothschild contrived to save the p rop- erty that had been entrusted to him. The well-known fact that all Rothschild's posses- sions had been confiscated by the French led the exiled elector to believe that his own property had been lost too. In fact he does not appear to have thought it even worth while to make inquiries about it. When matters had settled down again Rothschild immediately proceeded to do business with the prop- erty he had saved. . . . The brothers are most scrupulous in observing the injunction that their father laid upon them when he was dying, which was to collaborate in absolute brotherly harmony in ail business matters. Indeed they treat the memory of their father with such pie ty that they refer to him in all important business ma t- ters, and Nathan generally applies to doubtful case s a rule his father recommended. When the elector returned to his states in 1813, the House of Rothschild not merely offered immedi- ately to return to him the capital sums with which it had been entrusted, it also undertook to pay the customary rate of interest from the day when it had received them.

Students of economics and politics have no doubt frequently wondered how the House of Rothschild has been able to achieve so much in so short a time . Leaving the effects of chance out of account, its s uc- cess is attributable principally to the strictest o bserv- ance of certain fundamental maxims, together with wise business management, and the exploitation of favorable opportunities. The principal maxim is harmonious collaboration in all business matters, t o which reference has already been made. After their father's death every offer, whatsoever its origin might be, was made the subject of joint discussion between the brothers; any transaction of any importance at all was carried through according to a concerted plan by their joint endeavors, and a ll the brothers had an equal share in the result. They continued to act in close agreement, in spite of th e fact that they gradually settled in places far remo ved from one another. This circumstance, indeed, in- stead of interfering with their collaboration, has proved an actual advantage; it has enabled them to obtain the fullest information as to the state of a ffairs in the principal markets, so that each of them can from his own center the more effectively take the preliminary steps in any business. The firm as a whole then takes it over and carries it through. Another of the principles which the Rothschilds have adopted is to keep moving, and not allow them- selves to become enmeshed by circumstances. . . ."},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"The Rothschild Business Throughout the World 341 Finally it should be noted that, apart from the rea son- ableness of their demands, the punctiliousness with which they carry out their duties, the simplicity a nd clarity of their schemes, and the intelligent way i n which they are put into operation, the personal mor al character of each of the five brothers has been a d e- termining factor in the success of their undertakin gs. It is not difficult for those whose power enables them to attach large numbers to their interests, to secure the backing of a powerful party; but to unit e the support of all parties and, in the popular phra se, to win the esteem of gentle and simple, implies the possession not merely of material resources, but al so of spiritual qualities not always found in associat ion with wealth and power.

They have rendered the most important services in such a man- ner as to make them most acceptable, for they have been actuated not by considerations of policy but b y natural benevolence and kindness. 80 This eulogy of the Rothschilds was a masterpiece ex e- cuted by a clever stylist; it was bound to raise th e prestige of the House enormously, especially in the opinion of those who did not know how it came to be written.

One passage in particular, although not included in the Conversational Encyclopedia, may be worth quoting. \"There is a truth,\" Gentz remarks, \"which, although not quite new, is generally not properly understood. Th e word luck as commonly used in the history of famous in- dividuals or eminent families is bereft of all mean ing, when we endeavor to dissociate it entirely from the personal and individual factors in each case. There are circumstances and events in life in which good or i ll luck may be a determining although not an exclusive fact or in human destiny. Lasting success, however, and con - stant failure are always, and to a much greater deg ree than is generally supposed, attributable to the per sonal deserts or the personal failings and shortcomings o f those who are blessed by the one or damned by the other. Nevertheless the most outstanding personal qualitie s may sometimes require exceptional circumstances and wor ld- shattering events to come to fruition.

It is true that Natha n quietly exerted an influence that tended to harmoni ze the often conflicting aims of the various branches; but on account of the primitive nature of the communica tion at that time, and the inadequate postal arrangement s, it was impossible, in spite of all the efforts he made , for him to supervise everything. The result was that each brother had a fairly wide scope within his own center, it being left entirely to his own judgment within certain limits to do what he co n- sidered best in the interests of the firm as a whol e. Be- tween Vienna, Frankfort, Paris, and London, these p laces being linked up on the main European routes, commun i- cation was easier. It was just the least gifted of the brothers, Carl, who was practically isolated from t he others at Naples, and therefore often had to travel per- sonally to Paris and London in order to get into to uch with his brothers. A final solution of the problem of the Austrian tro ops at Naples had become urgently necessary.

The greater part of Naples public securities was he ld abroad. Of the annual interest, only about two mill ion ducats remained in the country itself, while the ba lance constituted a tribute that Naples had to pay to for eign capitalists. The budget suffered from the malady of a constantly growing deficit, which rose to 3,800,000 ducats in 1825. This meant that the interest on foreign de bt was only slightly less than the state's annual defi cit. Count Apponyi, afterwards ambassador in Paris, had been sent to Naples by Metternich to examine the si tua- tion on the spot. \"Cavaliere de' Medici,\" he report ed, 4 \"regards the presence of our troops as nothing but an intolerable burden. As finance minister he trembles at the idea that the foreign occupation may last until after 1826, and by compelling him to take refuge in an- other loan, still more increase the state's terrify ing deficit. This caused him to say to Rothschild a few days ago : 'If the Austrian troops remain here after the limit of time fixed by the convention, I am determined to hand in my resignation.'\" Fundamentally Carl Rothschild was absolutely on the side of the finance minister.

He began, therefore, no- ticeably to adopt the Neapolitan point of view, and grad- ually to forget to consider the interests of Austri a, although he owed his position in Naples to that cou ntry. He too favored speedy evacuation, especially as the new king, who had succeeded to the throne in Januar y, 1825, and on whom he wanted to make a good impressi on, cherished the same wish. At Vienna he was actually suspected of supporting the Neapolitan finance mini ster in his obstinate efforts to recover part of the mon eys paid out to the Austrian troops on the ground that they were excessive. The Neapolitan government was claiming the repayment of 1,013,398 ducats as excess payment s made only up to November, 1821, and proposed to re- tain 100,000 ducats each month from the moneys paya ble to the Austrian war account until the adjustment sh ould have been fully effected. Austria offered only 650, 000 gulden in satisfaction, and was contemplating makin g deductions even from this amount. However, she was afraid of any public dispute in the matter. The qua rter- master-general himself admitted in a letter to Coun t Nadasdy that the estimate of 650,000 florins was to o low. He said that in his view it would be better to agre e to the amount demanded by the Neapolitan government as a lump sum, rather than to allow the matter to be dis - cussed in detail, as that would be too damaging to Austria. 5 Ficquelmont also expressed his fears 6 that innumer- able claims might arise, the airing of which would be unpleasant for Austria. He offered to arrange for t he settlement of the matter, \"without publicity and wi thout compromising the dignity of our government,\" asking only that the repayments should not be made out of the resources of the I. and R. war-chest at Naples, but through the House of Rothschild.

Medici urgently needed the money, and would not wait any longer. He therefore applied to Carl Rothschild, in- forming him that the royal treasury required 1,500, 000 ducats in excess of its normal revenue. He asked Rothschild to advance this sum, offering as partial se- curity the claim exceeding a million ducats which h ad been recognized by Austria. 7 Carl Rothschild immediately sent Medici's letter to Vienna in order to ascertain the imperial governmen t's attitude in the matter. As, however, it was not yet in- clined to give way, in spite of Ficquelmont's repre senta- tions, it simply put the letter by. Nevertheless, i n re- turn for special securities in the event of Austria failing to pay, Carl Rothschild advanced 1,200,000 ducats, be- cause he attached great value to being on good term s with Medici and the new king. This brought him into great favor in high quarters, a fact which Carl exploited to create a position for himself in society in Naples, as his brothers had done else where. During the winter of 1826 many distinguished foreig ners flocked to the beautiful city of the south; amongst them were Leopold of Saxe-Coburg—afterwards King Leo- pold I of Belgium 8 —the Duke of Lucca, and other princes, as well as several wealthy English familie s. \"This greatly enlivens our social gatherings,\" Carl said in a private letter. 9 \"Amateur companies perform French plays; there are balls and soirees—in a word, in sp ite of everything, life is very gay. . . .\""},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"The House of Rothschild Rides the Storm 347 Meanwhile, as the result of representations made by Solomon to Metternich, 10 the House of Rothschild had been informed that there was no objection to credit ing to the House of Rothschild the moneys which Austria wo uld finally refund to Naples. Their total, however, re- mained undefined, and as it went very much against the grain to pay these amounts at all, Metternich was s ome- what annoyed that the House of Rothschild should in - tervene in the matter. At the end of December, 1826, Emperor Francis and Metternich decided finally to evacuate the Two Sici lies,, although not without emphatically warning the king never to think of changing the form of government. On the occasion of the Austrians' leaving, General Fri mont, the officer in command, had recommended various per - sons for decorations, including the finance ministe r Medici and Carl Rothschild. In view of the attitude adopted by both of these in the matter of the rebat es, Vienna was not prepared to consider the suggestion, Metternich minuted on the proposal that Medici ough t not to receive any distinction, 11 since he already possessed the Grand Cross of the Order of St. Stephen, and th at Baron Rothschild should not receive one \"because he is not qualified to receive the distinction suggested. \" This was, in effect, a reply to the new attitude which C arl Rothschild had assumed. People in Vienna were almos t inclined to call him a traitor or a deserter.

Austria maintained her resist ance against paying in full the amount demanded, until t he King of Naples finally yielded, in order not to ups et the, agreement arrived at.

This appeal, however, met with little success; Austria finally paid only 338, 564 gul- den, which Rothschild took over on account of his c laim against Naples, and at the end of 1829 this settlem ent was accepted for the sake of peace. Although, as in Carl's case, Metternich was some- times not entirely in agreement with the attitude o f the brothers Rothschild, he always came back to them ag ain, in both public and personal matters. There was no o ther financier who controlled such large sums of money a nd such important international connections. Moreover, it had been the chancellor's experience that the st rictest secrecy was observed and maintained by the Rothschi lds in all transactions of a delicate nature. In that r espect they were in marked contrast to most other bankers; and this was of special importance to a man in such a p ublic position as Metternich. Transactions constantly arose in which the financia l interests of the imperial house, to which Metternic h naturally always wished to prove his devotion, had to be made to harmonize with those of the state in such a way as to avoid any public criticism. The Rothschilds w ere particularly skilful in handling such cases, and th ey thereby made themselves indispensable to Austria's lead- ing statesmen, in spite of any disagreements. A striking example of this was furnished when Mette r- nich had recourse to the services of the Rothschild s in connection with the financial affairs of Marie Loui se, wife of Napoleon I and daughter of Emperor Francis.

Notwithstanding Napoleon's entreaties, she never on ce expressed the wish to visit him at Elba, to say not hing of St. Helena, although it is true that if she had so wished, her father and, still more, Metternich woul d have opposed her. The chancellor wished Napoleon's memory to be completely obliterated, and he was par - ticularly skilful in the case of Marie Louise in ex ploit- ing her weaknesses to that end. She was callous and pleasure-loving, and used to visit fashionable spas ; she lived only for her own amusement and did not even trouble to answer Napoleon's letters. In 1814, while the ex-empress was staying at Aix-le s- Bains, Metternich allotted to her as courtier a man who not only played the part of courtier, but also had an im- portant political role in Metternich's service. Ada m Albert, Count von Neipperg, was a handsome man of thirty-nine; he had lost his eye through a sword-th rust in the war and wore a black eye-patch. He was a sma rt and elegant officer, and had the reputation of poss ess- ing unusual courage and exceptional intellectual an d diplomatic gifts. It was his duty to obliterate all thoughts of Napoleon and the empire in Marie Louise's mind, and to keep her from all contact with any member of Na- poleon's family or his supporters. He was to be onl y too successful. The Congress of Vienna had decided that the duke- doms of Parma, Piacenza and Guastalla should belong to Marie Louise \"en toute souverainete et propriete .\" As long as she ruled in accordance with the principles of an absolute monarchy, without constitution or represen ta- tive bodies, she thereby acquired a kind of private prop- erty in these territories, by the act of the congre ss, this being quite in accordance with the contemporary att i- tude of regarding a state as a patrimony. It had, h ow- ever, been laid down by the Treaty of Paris of 1817 that"},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"350 The Rise of the House of Rothschild these possessions should not be hereditary, but sho uld pass to another prince on Marie Louise's death. Yet no provision had been made as to how the transfer shou ld be effected, nor as to how the duchess's private pr operty should be determined. Marie Louise had entered Parma in 1816, Count Neip- perg sitting with her in her carriage. He had in th e meantime not merely obtained complete control over the duchess's actions, as Metternich had wanted—he had also won her heart. The man in gold-braided uniform, sit ting next her in her carriage, as Marie Louise entered P arma, was already her lover, and Napoleon, the great em- peror and general, her husband and the father of he r child, had been completely forgotten. The affair was no secret at Parma, and it proved us e- less to try to hush it up; it soon became publicly known that on May 1, 1817, a daughter had been born to Ma rie Louise and her courtier in the palace of the ruler of Parma. This child received the name Albertine at he r christening. Two years later on August 8, 1819, 13 Marie Louise gave birth to a son, who received the names William Albert, Count of Montenuovo—this being the Italian equivalent to the name Neipperg (Neuberg). Both children were therefore illegitimate, for Mari e Louise's husband, from whom she never obtained a di - vorce, did not die until May 5, 1821, in his distan t island prison at St. Helena, while the marriage between Ne ip- perg and Marie Louise, who had been living constant ly together for some years, was celebrated in secret i n Sep- tember, 1821. As the Duke of Reichstadt was still alive, Neipperg feared that on the death of their parents, his chil dren might be left unprovided for. He therefore begged Marie Louise, while there was still time, to extrac t from her small dominions some money that could be declar ed to be her private property so the children could be given portions out of it. Marie Louise too realized tha t some-"},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"The House of Rothschild Rides the Storm 351 thing must be done for their future, since on her d eath her lands would pass to another prince. She knew th at there was an intention to construct a dukedom out o f some Bohemian estates for the son by her marriage w ith Napoleon, but nobody at Vienna knew anything about the Montenuovos. Up to 1826 the annual income from the territories r uled by Marie Louise had never been completely absorbed in administration, and it had been possible to allo t large sums to the building of castles and bridges, and to im- provements in the ducal gardens, etc. The Castle of Piacenza had been built, and the palaces at Parma a nd Colorno had been magnificently refurnished; bridges had been constructed over the Taro and the Trebbia; a t hea- ter had also been built; and a survey had been made of the whole country. Neipperg argued that these out- lays had been a drain on Marie Louise's personal in come, since it could not be disputed that any balance lef t over in administering the state belonged to the ruler. 14 The expenditure in question amounted to 10,435,000 fran cs, 15 and he said that she should ask that at any rate a part of this sum should be refunded in cash and applied to forming a private estate for the duchess. Neipperg fully realized how far his understanding with Metternich went, and that the chancellor would not be able to refuse his request. The general decided with Marie Louise that the matter should at first be dea lt with without mentioning the Montenuovo children, but onl y the Duke of Reichstadt when necessary. The general then wrote to Metternich to say 16 that after all the sacri- fices which Marie Louise had made for the peace and welfare of Europe, and in view of the enormous bene fits which she had conferred on her subjects, the questi on of her personal and private property ought to be clear ed up.

Neipperg proposed that either all the powers should conclude a supplementary convention, or a loan shou ld be issued whereby what was due to the duchess could be made immediately available. Neipperg pointed out in a memorandum 17 written in support of his contention that \"nobody can protest that, according to the law of t he land, the whole direct and indirect income of the s tate, of whatever kind it may be, is absolutely at the so ver- eign's disposal; and she may, after the expenses of the administration in all its branches have been met ou t of the annual budget, dispose of any sums saved or bal - ances left over, entirely as she thinks fit.\" Metternich wanted to keep the other powers out of the matter as far as possible, and advised as a \"le ss com- promising procedure\" that a direct agreement should be reached 18 with the Duke of Lucca, Marie Louise's desig- nated successor. He too was in favor of \"the applic a- tion of carefully designed measures in order to pla ce her Majesty's property beyond the reach of foreign claims and, in so far as it cannot actually be take n out of the country, to secure its separation from the p roperty of the state.\" The issue of an \"appropriate loan\" seemed to him to furnish an easier way out. \"In considering a loan,\" he wrote, \"we have, it is true, to keep in mind the fa ct that her Majesty is herself the beneficiary of the duked oms; but this does not constitute a reason for denying h er power to contract loans on the country's security by virt ue of her recognized sovereign rights.\" The justification for such a loan was to be found in the fact that Marie Louise \"has made notable and extraordinary sacrifices in c arry- ing through important works for the benefit of her sub- jects and the country; and in order to a certain ex tent"},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"The House of Rothschild Rides the Storm 353 to indemnify herself for these sacrifices without i mposing new burdens upon her beloved subjects or exacting t he taxes due with excessive severity, she has decided to have recourse to a loan.\" Metternich stated emphatically that the questions o f the Duke of Reichstadt's inheritance, of a civil li st for Marie Louise, or of the distinction between private prop- erty and the public treasury should not be brought before the public. The only result of this would be to dra w undue attention to the matter and to compromise one - self. Neither did he consider it necessary to go in to any question of accounts with the public, excepting suc h as had reference to the amount and conditions of the l oan. After lengthy correspondence, Neipperg reported in a personal discussion of the matter with Metternich a t Vienna that 19 \"her Majesty the archduchess has decided to propose to her council that she shall apply one- sixth of the state property [patrimonium] which is valued at thirty millions to the formation of an allodial pro perty, which would be hers to dispose of as she pleased, a nd to make a gift to her subjects of the rest of the s um that she had used in works for the benefit of the public weal, the cost of which amounted to 10,439,000 francs. Ma rie Louise wishes to leave it to the council to decide whether the public debt of Parma shall be increased from it s present amount of four millions to nine millions, o r whether steps shall be taken to sell some of the st ate lands.\" Metternich felt it difficult to come to a decision. The problems involved were of a difficult and exceeding ly delicate nature, such as were hardly suitable for o fficial discussion. He therefore decided again to ask Solom on Rothschild for his advice. When the question became acute Metternich was staying on his Johannisberg es - tate on the Rhine.

He then wrote a long letter to Solo - mon, 20 carefully explaining to him that the archduchess wished to have available a capital sum of from five to six million francs, and to assure herself of the right to spend the income derivable from it in such a manner as sh e should deem fit. There were political objections to Neip- perg's proposal that state lands should be sold; wh ile if she increased the public debt, the archduchess was afraid of losing popularity. \"In my humble opinion,\" Metternich wrote, \"the fol- lowing scheme might be suitable. The archduchess should state publicly to her council that she could just as well have applied the state revenues—used of her own free will in erecting buildings for public purposes , or about to be so used—for acquiring a private propert y, but that she does not intend to do this; that she i s leaving for the benefit of the state what has already been spent, as well as what will be spent, but wishes to secure a sum of five to six million francs out of the whole amou nt for her free disposal. \"After making this declaration she should take up t he sum as stated and deposit it in the form of bonds i n her treasury. The transaction may be a fictitious one, for she does not need ready money; she could leave the secu ri- ties in her treasury, or issue them in whole or in part. My idea is that only five per cent securities shoul d be created.\" Metternich wished to have Solomon's views as to how this scheme should be put into practice in detail; and on receipt of the chancellor's letter, Solomon hastene d \"to submit his suggestions for his Highness's wise cons idera- tion.\" 21 \"In my humble opinion,\" he replied, \"the object whi ch you have in view could best and most effectively be real- ized in the following way.

They were far too well satisfied that the matter was being ar ranged so easily, to attempt to obtain better conditions.

If on examining the contract,\" he add ed, \"your Majesty shares my feelings, all my wishes wil l be completely satisfied.\" 28 Marie Louise, who understood nothing of financial matters, but gathered that she would obtain the mil lions she wanted, agreed to everything, signed the contra ct, and rejoiced with Neipperg that the future of her c hil- dren by the second marriage was now assured. She wr ote to her father saying: 29 \"I have accepted and ratified the fictitious loan of 300,000 francs annuities, 30 which Prince Metternich and Werklein have concluded at Vienna wi th Rothschild and Mirabaud.

Metternich informed Solomon of this, as- suring him that he would personally endeavor to sec ure the duke's consent. But Solomon was most unwilling to proceed without this security. \"I must honestly confess to your Highness,\" he re- plied, 31 \"that I can see no prospect of this matter being satisfactorily settled in such a case. Her Majesty cannot flatter herself that it will be easy to double the country's indebtedness and to find a market for such a large quan- tity of bonds, without offering the public every ki nd of security.\" He therefore emphatically begged Metter- nich to use all his influence to secure the duke's consent. The chancellor concurred all the more readily in Ro ths- child's appeal, as he himself wished to secure this consent in view of possible further developments. 32 Baron von Werklein accordingly went to see the Duke of Lucca with a letter from Marie Louise and Metter - nich. The duke unexpectedly made no difficulties. H e authorized Werklein to write to Marie Louise and Me t- ternich and say that it was a pleasure to him to be able to meet the wishes of the archduchess. 33 He also per- mitted Neipperg to have an inventory taken of Princ ess Marie Louise's personal effects. He stipulated only that the duchess should not arrange any further loan, th at she should create a sinking fund and sell no property b elong- ing to the state. In the end all parties were satisfied, including th e Aus- trian Treasury, which immediately recouped itself o ut of the loan to the extent of 400,000 francs disburs ed on military expenditure and on the maintenance of Mari e Louise during the years 1814 to 1816.

Metternich wrote to Nei p- perg: 35 \"Werklein will have told you that Herr von Rothschild wants a little St. George for his managi ng clerk. 36 This indicates a certain amount of vanity, the Rothschilds, in spite of their millions and their g enerous loyalty, having a craving 37 for honors and distinctions. At the same time I feel that it is not in the best of taste to ask that such an order should be conferred upon a c lerk, and I suggest that you reply to this request that t he order of Constantine is a knightly order. It constitutes a genu- ine religious brotherhood, and is not simply a dist inc- tion, and as the (Jewish) religion forbids its adhe rents to take the statutory oath of the order, the chancello r of the order would not be able to confer the cross.

In putting his secretary forward he had himself in view, for if Wertheimstein were to be ma de a Companion, he himself was bound to be made at lea st a Commander. As he took Metternich's pleasant words at their face value, and had no suspicion of the co rre- spondence quoted above, he wrote the following lett er to Werklein at Parma: 39 "},{"pageNumber":368,"pageContent":"362 The Rise of the House of Rothschild \"I have just taken the opportunity of asking our mo st esteemed prince to lend his powerful support to my re- quest, and the gracious reply which I have received from his Highness justifies me in anticipating that if y ou will only be so good as to make a suggestion in that qua rter, his Highness will not be averse from . . . gracious ly acceding to it. \"I leave it to you to choose the most propitious mo ment for putting forward the proposal, having full confi dence in your feelings of friendship for me, which I know how to value.

He brought wi th him a secret letter from Metternich to Neipperg. \"T o my great satisfaction the matter has gone through,\" the letter ran, 40 \"and something must be done for the bearer. He is Rothschild's right-hand man, and a splendid y oung fellow of first-rate intelligence. He hopes to get the minor cross; you know my views on that matter.

Metternich supported Solomo n's plan because he hoped that the money would thus cer - tainly remain in Vienna, and would not, as the empe ror feared, be dissipated by the duchess. He therefore used his influence with Marie Louise and Neipperg in sup - port of Solomon's proposal, without considering tha t Solomon was hoping thus to derive further profit fr om the transaction.

Metternich and Rothschild discussed the proposed in - vestment of the money with Werklein at Vienna, and Werklein brought a detailed memorandum to Marie Louise 46 in which Rothschild showed that it would be to her advantage to sell the Parma bonds, and to inves t the money thus made available in other suitable public se- curities. He pointed out that the Parma bonds did n ot constitute as good a security as those of larger st ates, since it was always the smaller states that were fi rst en- dangered through political movements of any impor- tance. He suggested that shares in the national ban k would constitute an exceedingly good and safe inves t- ment.

They had in fact scarcely come into touch with each other at all, there having been onl y oc- casional and casual meetings between them. This was due primarily to the fact that Goethe did not stay at Frankfort at all during the period between 1796 and 1814, when the House of Rothschild was first coming to the front, and that in later years his visits to th e town were always quite short; he was indeed not much at- tached to his native town, as is indicated by the f act that in 1817 he renounced Frankfort citizenship. Nevertheless he, like the rest of the world, heard of the remarkable success of the family which had orig i- nated in the Jewish quarter of Frankfort. Born of patrician parents, Goethe had as a child, as he tel ls us in \"Dichtung und Wahrheit,\" only rarely peered at the ghetto, as at a strange world. From his earliest days he had been brought up in an atmosphere of hostility toward the Jews, and later when his intelligence matured he had scarcely developed any more friendly attitude toward them. These sentiment s were often revealed in his conversation, and the ef forts of the Jews to secure their emancipation would evok e harsh comments. The growing prominence of the Roths - childs, when he had reached an advanced age, often led to Goethe expressing his attitude on Jewish questio ns. The introduction at Frankfort on September 23, 1823 , of a new law, permitting marriage between Christians a nd Jews, was the occasion of a passionate outburst in con- versation with the Chancellor von Muller. \"This scandalous law,\" the poet exclaimed, \"will undermine all family sense of morality, intimately asso- ciated with religion as it is. When this goes throu gh, how can a Jewess be prevented from becoming principal L ady of the Bedchamber? Foreigners are bound to think th at bribery has been at work to make such a law possibl e. I suspect the all-powerful Rothschilds are behind it. \" 50 "},{"pageNumber":373,"pageContent":"The House of Rothschild Rides the Storm 367 In 1823, therefore, Goethe was already referring to the Rothschilds as all-powerful, recognizing the fa ct that it was through their money and influence that the Jews had been enabled, with the support of foreign pow- ers, to get their way against the senate and citize ns of Frankfort. The poet also inferred quite rightly tha t the widely current myth that the Rothschilds had made a ll their money very easily, and practically at one str oke, was a pure fabrication. On October 20, 1828, he was talking to Eckermann about the period required for cultural or any other great achievements and said: \"Yes, my dear fellows, it al l amounts to this; in order to do something you must be something. We think Dante great, but he had a civil iza- tion of centuries behind him; the House of Rothschi ld is rich, but it has required more than one generati on to attain such wealth. Such things all lie deeper than one thinks.\" 51 In any case this remark shows that Goethe found foo d for thought in the phenomenon of the rise of this f amily of fellow Frankforters. With the Bethmanns Goethe was more intimate, and he was interested in watchin g the rivalry between the two leading Frankfort banking f irms; however, as he had little understanding for financi al mat- ters, he was amused rather than concerned about the ir rivalry, and enjoyed retailing good Frankfort jokes about Rothschild and Bethmann, and stories of the way in which they spoiled each other's game. 52 It was only toward the end of his life that Goethe actu- ally met any members of the Rothschild family. In h is diaries we have only the short entry that on May 2, 1827, two young Rothschilds with their tutor John Darby called on Goethe.

The members of the Frankfort line are not mentioned by Goethe at all. The only other reference we find is to the effect that, a few days before his death, on Ma rch 14, 1832, Goethe was contemplating an oil painting, pro pped up on his easel, of the old bridge at Prague which was to go to \"Baron Rothschild at Vienna.\" 53 In view of these scanty references it is not unreas on- able to assume that any personal intercourse during the latter years was of an exceedingly superficial natu re, and that the colossus of intellect and the colossus of money, both originating from the same native city had had only the most casual intercourse, their knowledge of one an- other being derived practically from reading and he ar- say. 54 The Rothschild visitors referred to in the diaries were no doubt typical of the innumerable persons who cal led out of curiosity. Goethe had to receive many such, espe- cially during the last years of his life. It had be come a special honor to have seen the famous aged poet fac e to face, and this visit no doubt constituted a small s tep on the long road of social advancement.

The appointment of Herries had actually been approved by the king, and he had been summoned to Windsor. Thereupon Lord Lans- downe and his party suddenly offered the strongest oppo- sition and endeavored to persuade Herries to refuse office on the ground of ill health. Herries refused to accede to their wishes, with the re- sult that his opponents mobilized the press against him in order, if possible, to delay the appointment. Th e Times and the Morning Chronicle expressed the view that t he appointment of Herries was out of the question, as he was closely associated with a big financier who con trolled the European money-market. Other papers 57 took up the cry that this fact made it quite impossible to appoint Herries chancellor of the exchequer. The conservative papers took up the issue, and for a week the whole British press was full of the relati on- ship between Nathan and Herries.

The harsh reactionary and clerica l regime of Charles X had aroused such opposition in the country that in an election affecting 428 seats, on ly 125 supporters of the government were returned. Charles X was therefore forced to dismiss Villele, and to sen d for Martignac to form a moderate ministry; but he cheri shed secret plans of revenge. Although the state of things in France afforded the Rothschilds some ground for satisfaction, the gener al situ- ation in Europe was anything but pleasant. The Gree k problem was still unsolved, and the battle of Navar ino, in which the Turko-Egyptian fleet was destroyed, pr o- duced a tense situation. This sought relief in open hos- tilities between Russia and Turkey. The Porte went so far as to declare that the tsar was the arch-enemy of the Turks. In these circumstances Emperor Alexander's succes- sor Nicholas began to think of war. Whereas Metter- nich still congratulated himself on having converte d Alexander into an Ultra from being a Jacobin, 59 and on having attached him permanently to his system, Nich olas inclined to a Russo-Nationalist policy. But for thi s, and especially for war against Turkey, he needed money. The Russian government therefore inquired of the Ho use of Rothschild in Paris, toward the end of March, 18 28, whether it would place its services at the disposal of the Russian government for floating a large loan.

James therefore decided to communicate the inquiry he had received to Metternich through his brother S olo- mon, asking the chancellor to express his opinion.

The Russians had meanwhile been carrying on war against Turkey with varying success, and in August, 1829, they had advanced through the Balkans as far as Adrianople. Although their position was not by any means free from danger, their display of energy led the sultan to sign a treaty of peace at Adrianople on S eptem- ber 14, 1829, which, although it did not put Russia in possession of Constantinople, certainly secured her pre- dominance in the East, improved her boundaries agai nst Turkey, and offered great political and economic ad van- tages.

Nathan sent a r e- port on the situation to his brother Solomon in a l etter written in Hebrew, of which Solomon made a personal , and therefore very poor, translation for Metternich 's in- formation. \"I am now going to tell you, my dear Solomon,\" the letter ran, 62 \"all about how everything is here so far. There are some here who want to quarrel, and that w ith Lieven 63 . . . and want us to send angry notes, because Polignac is angry, too. Now I have spoken about the Turkish loan, and they said to me: 'Austria will do it, but it can't be done without us in England.

As a result of their happy knack in floating loans tha t almost immediately afterward were most favorably quoted, a ll countries wanted to have recourse to the Rothschild s for their loans, and a positively jealous rivalry devel oped to secure their favor. While needy states were seeking opportunities for o b- taining money on credit, the brothers Rothschild we re looking for safe and profitable investments for the ir ac- cumulated capital. The state of Prussia again enter ed into negotiations with the banking firm. The 5% in- terest payable on the £5,000,000 loan of 1818 was a heavy burden on the state budget. All states at tha t time were endeavoring to convert their public debt, and the Prussian finance minister, Motz, wished to reduce t he interest payable on the state debt of 36,000,000 th alers from 5% to 4%.

From the start, Rother th ought of no one but the Rothschilds. He went to Helgoland in July, 1829, where he met a confidential agent of Na than's, and had a non-committal discussion with him about t he business. He then went to Frankfort and negotiated with the house there. But he was offered conditions he could not accept. \"Gratuitous interference by business men here,\" Rot her reported to his sovereign, 65 \"has caused the Frankfort house to suspect the possibility of making large pr ofits.

We owe it entirely to him and to the effor ts of Herr Rother that this business has been put thro ugh to the credit and profit of Prussia's finances.\" Rother similarly reported 68 to the king that this ex- traordinarily favorable agreement had far exceeded any- thing that he had expected. Nathan in London and his brother at Frankfort were less well satisfied.

Rother himself was very high in praise of his own work. \"T his contract,\" he reported to his sovereign, \"is purely ad- vantageous to the state, and constitutes the first example of a financial operation by a great state for the r eduction of interest on a large scale in which the nominal a mount of the debt has not been increased, the interest pa yable on a debt of about 27,000,000 thalers being reduced from 5 to 4%.

Further loans immediately followed on that of Prus- sia. The Austrian government also wished gradually to proceed to the conversion of her 5% state debt to 4 %, and the ministerial conference decided on the issue of a loan of from twenty to thirty million gulden 4% state de ben- tures through the four native banking firms, in whi ch Solomon Rothschild had come to be included, after t he ruin of the Fries Bank. 70 Count Kolowrat, who had been appointed head of the commission of the privy council to control the fina ncial administration, had recommended this issue on the ground that 71 the interest rates obtaining in Germany, France, England, and Holland were lower than 4% and a reduction in those countries either had been or w as about to be undertaken. It did not seem that there was any prospect of political complications for some ti me. The loan was decided upon, and on April 3, the em- peror expressed his special satisfaction with the c onduct of the four banks on this occasion. Rothschild certainly endeavored to get rid of the b onds as speedily as possible, and invested all the ready cash in the three accounts of Marie Louise of Parma in t he new 4% Metalliques bonds, at the issue price (subje ct to a commission for his trouble), on the ground tha t they were a particularly safe investment.

He did this the more readily as he had already made a large profit out of the Parma bu si- ness ; but his sacrifice of the relatively trivial commission made a good impression. It was just such an occasio n as Solomon would use for playing up to his reputati on for \"disinterestedness and honor.\" In any case Solo mon was unable at once to find purchasers for the large volume of security issued in connection with the Austrian loan. In addition to the Prussian and Austrian loans just described, they undertook an operation on a far lar ger scale, fraught with far more serious consequences, namely the underwriting of 80,000,000 francs of French ren tes, needed by the French government to pay for the Algi ers campaign on which it had just embarked. Several riv al firms had stated that they were prepared to deal wi th it. Aguado offered 73 to underwrite it at 97-55%, a consor- tium headed by Mallet Freres offered 98%, the Syndi - cat des Receveurs-Generaux offered 100%, and the Rothschilds—102.72 1/2%. \"The rivals perceived,\" wr ote Capefigue, \"that in future nobody would be able to stand against the Rothschilds.\" Even these gigantic transactions left them unsatisf ied.

Solomon Rothschild had been informed by the finance minister Count Nadasdy that the Austrian administra -"},{"pageNumber":389,"pageContent":"The House of Rothschild Rides the Storm 383 tion was proposing to convert all its 5% securities to 4%. He promised on his journeys to ascertain foreign se nti- ment regarding this proposal, and to let Vienna kno w the result of his investigations. In June, 1830, he made his first report to Nadasdy; 74 it was sent from Frankfort and contained a proposal which in its essentials wa s di- rected against the House of Bethmann. His idea was that the 5% Bethmann bonds, which were still in cir cu- lation, should be redeemed at Frankfort by cash pay - ments at par, through the Frankfort branch of the House. \"Your Excellency,\" he wrote, \"is not unaware of my deep devotion to the Austrian state, which is share d by all my brothers and partners. I trust that you are con- vinced that we always have the best interests of th e treas- ury in view, and that it must be our principal conc ern to fulfil your Excellency's wishes to the best of o ur ability.\" The taking over of the Bethmann bonds was to serve \"to secure and hasten the conversion operation as f ar as possible, and create enthusiasm abroad for the tran sac- tion.\" Not until he had delivered the 5% debentures did Solomon wish that his firm should receive 4% debent ures at the rate of 105 florins for each hundred, or tre asury notes, or money, or whatever else the authorities c onsid- ered most convenient. \"Since my brothers and I,\" Solomon continued, \"have no keener desire than constantly to furnish proofs to the Austrian state of our most disinterested service, u naf- fected by any private interests, we flatter ourselv es that your Excellency will receive our most dutiful offer with your customary kindness.\" He hoped thereby to make the conversion more popular abroad. \"Your Excellency,\" he continued, \"may be convinced it is neither pride nor self-interest that induces me to take this matter up.

This was done, and the auth ori- ties forthwith sent this memorandum, which naturall y differed in many respects from the Rothschilds' off ers, to Amschel at Frankfort. He made some very sharp comments on Bethmann's document, ascribing its feeb le- ness to that bank's lack of resources and knowledge . \"If that firm,\" he wrote, 75 \"is really serious about the conversion, and means to throw itself heart and sou l into the business, it is inconceivable that it should ha ve neither the confidence nor the means to acquire the small q uantity of six hundred 4% Metalliques bonds in advance. Smaller firms, without such a well-known name or su ch a position as the firm in question, would certainly have offered to do so.\" The Rothschild memorandum described the reasons put forward by Bethmann as evasions, because that f irm was not strong enough, and did not sufficiently pos sess the confidence of the public to carry out so great an op- eration. Amschel Meyer asked Solomon, who was about to make a journey to Paris, to come and see him at Frank- fort in order to discuss the matter. The memorandum of the Frankfort Rothschild, written in grotesque Germ an, ran: \"The same [Solomon] assured me on his honor that he was not actuated by the least resentment at the con- version having been entrusted to the House of Bethm ann. He also asseverated that his house was devoted life and"},{"pageNumber":391,"pageContent":"The House of Rothschild Rides the Storm 385 soul to the Austrian government, and that both his honor and his private interests were involved in carrying through the conversion. He had negotiated the Frenc h and the Prussian loan, 'all these things hanging up on one another and being interdependent,' and he did n ot propose to act against his own interest. His house held fifteen to sixteen million gulden of Austrian publi c se- curities, which he could produce on demand, whereas the House of Bethmann had neither the resources nor the knowledge of markets nor the influence that were ne ces- sary. Not one of its partners had the requisite ene rgy to take control of such a business.\" The memorandum went on to state: \"It is possible an d indeed probable that one or more banking firms and their supporters believe, if they directly or indirectly got fabri- cated articles into the papers, and spread unfounde d rumors on several bourses, they could put the House of Rothschild in an unfavorable light to the Austrian gov- ernment, and at the same time extend their own sphe re of influence. We had expected such irresponsible ne ws- paper articles as those that recently appeared in s ome French papers, attributing the fall in rentes to th e action of the House of Rothschild, on the ground that we w anted to get rid of all our rentes at any price because w e had taken over a Turkish loan of eighty million francs. They will not be the last, as they are not the first, of their kind.\" The memorandum set forth that important firms deal- ing with governments would always have such fancifu l stories attached to them. Truth and justice were, h ow- ever, bound to prevail, and such lies would meet th eir own reward. By coming to the rescue with the greate r part of its cash resources, the House of Rothschild had quite recently, in May, prevented a terrible crisis on the Frankfort bourse, which would have had serious cons e- quences in other money-markets.

The memorandum concluded on its original note, asking t hat the Rothschilds might convert the Bethmann debentur es. The finance minister Count Nadasdy 76 was, however, unshakable. He was not willing to offend the House of Bethmann by allowing the conversion to be carried through by a different firm from that which had ori gi- nally negotiated the loan. The brothers Rothschild were then holding enormous quantities of state securitie s; in addition to their large Austrian investments they h eld millions of the newly issued French rentes as well as the bonds of the conversion loan of Prussia. The Rothsc hilds were therefore overstocked with bonds at a time whe n the general state of Europe might change from one o f apparent calm to one of acute crisis. While James did not feel that the political situati on in France was wholly satisfactory, he did not reali ze how critical it really was. He gave balls, which we re attended by princes such as the Duke of Chartres an d the Duke of Brunswick. He supported French theatrical undertakings to give performances abroad, as in Vie nna for instance. He was associating with princes and ministers and financiers.

James's own particular domain, the sensitive bourse , was already showing signs of the coming storm. On June 1 there was a severe slump, and several politi cians implored Rothschild to use his power to prevent a c ol- lapse. 77 The Duke of Decazes wrote to him: \"If you do not succeed in preventing the fall in values, ev eryone will believe that a coup d'etat will occur such as you so rightly fear, for you may be sure that in such a ca se no creditor would be paid his debts.\" 78 James Rothschild thereupon hastily went to see Poli -"},{"pageNumber":393,"pageContent":"The House of Rothschild Rides the Storm 387 gnac, as he had so often done before, and was again reas- sured by him. Anything of the kind was again out of the question; the bourse and the public were nervou s, that was all. Solomon, the chief of the Vienna house, had in the meantime also come from Frankfort to Paris. He had promised Metternich he would send an accurate repor t as to the state of affairs in France, and faithfull y ful- filled his promise in spite of all difficulties. His first report, dated June 19, 1830, reads as fol lows: 79 M OST E MINENT P RINCE : I hope that your Highness is enjoying perfect and constant well-being on your beautiful estate ... I am taking the liberty of reporting to you my arriva l here the day before yesterday. I am venturing al- ready to avail myself of the permission accorded me by your Highness to inform you occasionally of political events here through other than the ordina ry channels.

Solomon still hoped that peace might be maintained, but he viewed with dismay Polignac's intention of c hang- ing the electoral and press laws, to which he adher ed in spite of the strongest representations.

The ministry was dismayed and shocked by the result. The idea of changing the ele c- toral law was again being mooted. \"Such a step,\" Solomon wrote to Metternich, \"might lead to the most unforeseen results. Meanwhile the king is firmly determined not to weaken his royal prerog ative at any point, for he knows only too well from his o wn experience how quickly one concession leads to anot her, and how gravely the royal authority is endangered thereby.\" The general situation was exceedingly unpleasant, a l- though Solomon and James, especially James, still h oped that the storm would pass over. But at the end of J une rumors were thickening to the effect that the king and Polignac meditated a coup d'etat to rid themselves of the inconvenient liberal chamber before it met and to limit still further the rights of the people. Those who accepted these rumors, or whose actual knowledge co n- firmed them, secretly sold large holdings of bonds in the London market; and the House of Rothschild, bei ng interested in maintaining their value, was forced t o buy them.

He told th em about his call on the minister, and the letters sum mon- ing the delegates which he had seen, and his statem ents reassured the diplomats who were present. Meanwhile the ministers were secretly framing the famous ordinances in which the king, on Polignac's ad- vice, dissolved the hostile chamber before it had e ver met, ordered new elections on a different electoral basis, and severely limited the freedom of the press. Early on July 26, 1830, the ordinances were publish ed, to the general astonishment. The secret had been mo st scrupulously kept. The whole capital was swept by i n- dignation. Everyone said that this meant the end of all liberty, and the relapse of France into the darkest medie- valism.

The remainder were far from being sufficient to hold down the indignant ci ty. By July 29 the revolt had extended to the whole of Paris. The royal troops were slowly forced back on Saint-Cloud, where the king anxiously awaited the d e- velopment of events. He was now prepared to revoke the ordinances; but it was too late. Not only his p osi- tion, but that of the whole of his House, had colla psed. The Louvre and the Tuileries, defended by Swiss tro ops, were stormed by the populace. The revolution was victorious all along the line; o n July 31 Charles X and his guilty ministers fled. Th eir dominion was at an end. If the monarchy was to be maintained, only one thing could make this possible : the old line of the Bourbons must be eliminated. Recour se would have to be had to the king's rival, Louis Phi lippe of Orleans, son of the notorious Philippe Egalite, of the days of the great revolution. This prince played hi s part very cleverly; he contrived to make the people feel that they were conferring the crown upon him.

Th e revolution of July was a bourgeois revolution. The people, it is true, sacked a few royal chateaux, bu t the life and property of private persons were spared. Nathan Rothschild appears to have been the first ma n in London—apparently by means of a carrier pigeon sent by his brother—to receive news of the great ev ent. Even if this particular is unfounded, it is clear t hat he received news of events at Paris before the British gov- ernment. Talleyrand once stated in a letter to Mada me Adelaide, the sister and adviser of King Louis Philippe: 82 \"The English ministry is always informed of everything by Rothschild ten to twelve hours bef ore Lord Stuart's dispatches 83 arrive. This is necessarily so because the vessels used by the Rothschild couri ers belong to that House; they take no passengers and s ail in all weathers.\" On July 30, by which time peace had been restored i n the capital after the \"unexampled tumult and indesc rib- able disturbances\" of the previous three days, Solo mon Rothschild remembered his promise to report to Mett er- nich. \"We have been completely out of touch with the mini s- try for several days,\" he wrote, 84 \"as we do not even know where the ministers are. We are also told that the king has left his residence today for the Vendee; the tr icolor flag is flying on all public buildings, and the dip lomatic corps here has ceased to function.\" Solomon's view was that the issue of events must be quietly awaited. H e feared a civil war, and according to rumor the Duke of Orleans had accepted the crown. \"Such is the state, \" he continued, \"to which the self-confidence of thre e or four ministers has reduced France in three or four days.\" Rothschild described how a new administration was being set up in the capital with the support of fro m thirty to forty thousand men, drawn from the dregs of the population, who had been \"let loose against the kin g's"},{"pageNumber":398,"pageContent":"392 The Rise of the House of Rothschild troops.\" It could certainly not be denied that the people had behaved well, for apart from the king's propert y, no public or private property had been touched, eve n while the excitement was at its height. \"It is sati sfac- tory,\" Solomon admitted, \"to see the uniforms of th e regular citizen guard appearing at every corner; th ey are forty thousand strong, and often protected the city from pillage in 1814 and 1815.\" The confirmation of the rumor that the Duke of Or- leans had accepted the crown was a great relief to the brothers Rothschild. In spite of their connection w ith Charles X and his ministers, they had rendered fina ncial services to the Duke of Orleans too, and had thus c ome into touch with his house. They felt that they had been in a sense betrayed by Charles X, as he had never i n- formed them of the ordinances; and now that the duk e's star was in the ascendant, they saw a profitable op por- tunity of changing their allegiance. They according ly began to sympathize with the victorious revolution, and a letter from Solomon to a friend 85 clearly shows that they were preparing to play up to the new powers. I n that letter Solomon spoke of the general indignatio n aroused by the ordinances. \"There was no armed force,\" he said, \"that could ha ve controlled a people beside themselves with rage, wh o felt that they were being led to the slaughter by t heir king's command.

There was a slump on all the bour ses, while the hope of liberty ran high among the people s; the consequences for Metternich's \"peace of the wor ld\" seemed unpredictable. It had been the worst possible blow for the chancel lor and his system. At the time of the outbreak of the dis- turbances he was staying with Gentz at his country place Konigswart in Bohemia, and he received the first ne ws of these events through the Frankfort ambassador Ba ron von Munch-Bellinghausen, who had received the news from Rothschild. It is remarkable evidence of the e ffi- ciency of the Rothschild news service even during t imes of such disturbance, that both the British governme nt and the powerful chancellor, who controlled the vast di plo- matic machine of the Austrian Empire, should have r e- ceived the first news of these important events fro m the House of Rothschild. Munch-Bellinghausen's report, dated Frankfort, July 31, 86 was based on a letter from Solomon and James in Paris, which Meyer Amschel had received at Frank- fort on the 30th, and upon a short report brought b y a"},{"pageNumber":400,"pageContent":"394 The Rise of the House of Rothschild messenger. \"Rothschild has just received through a courier who left Paris on the 28th,\" the report ran , \"a short letter from his brothers, telling him not to worry about them, as they were well and hoped that things would improve within a few days. They could not wri te him any news, and the courier would tell them every - thing verbally. The courier's statement is to the e ffect that Paris is in a state of great commotion.\" There fol- lowed a description of the serious disturbances at the beginning of the revolution. Metternich and Gentz were at first unwilling to be- lieve the news. The chancellor had just expressed h is great satisfaction at the issue of the ordinances. He was now quite terrified. He kept hoping that the news w ould not be substantiated. \"I confess to you,\" Gentz wrote to Pilat immediatel y after the first news was received, 87 \"that I believe all this to be only partially true. The mysterious letter fr om a panic-stricken Rothschild and the stories of a cour ier are doubtful sources. But it is certain that things are not well.\" Nevertheless the Rothschild courier was right; and liberals throughout Europe took courage from what h ad happened in Paris, and felt that freedom was in the air. The news of the revolution resulted in a catastroph ic slump on the Frankfort bourse, and masses of securi ties were thrown on the market. While Meyer Amschel, be- ing the first to receive the news, had made some pr ovi- sion for this, he had not been able to do much in t he short time available, and the collapse of all public secu rities reduced him to a state of panic. He applied his eff orts, to keep the disaster within bounds. When disturbances consequently broke out in several German cities, and it was feared that they might oc cur in Frankfort too, the senate called up the special con- stabulary, so as to be ready for possible attacks. Amschel, who as a result of the last settlement enjoyed the rights"},{"pageNumber":401,"pageContent":"The House of Rothschild Rides the Storm 395 of citizenship, took up his duties as a special con stable when his turn came. He had more reason than anyone else in Frankfort to fear for his possessions, and he heard with terror that outside the city walls the peasant s were plundering country houses and driving landed propri e- tors from their estates. He anxiously awaited his brother Solomon, who had just informed him that he would arrive from Paris e arly in September. He wanted to enlighten the head branc h of the firm as to the present political situation i n Paris, and to discuss the measures to be taken to meet the terri- ble losses which the House had incurred. In these h ours of danger affecting the very existence of the House , the unity and harmonious collaboration of the brothers was particularly vital. On his arrival at Frankfort, Solomon was able some- what to reassure Amschel, at any rate as to the mom en- tary position in Paris. After the abdication of the king, the funds had somewhat improved during the last few days, as compared with the lowest point which they had touched, and the proclamation of the Duke of Orlean s had had a very good effect. Solomon described that event as a particularly fort u- nate one for the House of Rothschild. Their difficu lties consisted in their large holdings of securities. Th ey would not be able at the moment to get rid of the e nor- mous stock of French rentes except at very heavy lo ss. The conversion loan with the Prussian government, a r- ranged during a boom period, would also prove to be a ruinous business. Austrian securities were still th e best, but these too had suffered somewhat. The solution w as: Get out of all engagements! Have loan agreements rescinded wherever possible; and especially the new Prussian loan. Amschel promised to put out feelers in that directi on, and especially to try to secure Rother's support. A fter the most pressing matters had been agreed upon, Sol omon"},{"pageNumber":402,"pageContent":"396 The Rise of the House of Rothschild immediately returned to Paris, where his presence w as urgently required. The news of the July revolution had already begun to produce disturbances in all the st ates of Europe, and there was the danger of fresh compli ca- tions in the form of military intervention by the a bso- lutist conservative powers, whose peace was threate ned. There was still a possibility that the danger to th e House of Rothschild arising out of the July revolut ion might be averted. But if a European war were to bre ak out, securities would continue to fall in value and the very existence of the House would be imperiled. The brothers' slogan therefore was: Avert war at any pr ice. It was in their favor that the new king feared a ca m- paign against his usurped powers, and was anxious a t all costs to avoid external complications. He was a t pains to show the powers that if he had not stepped into the breach, France must have fared far worse, and that pos- sibly it would even have come to the establishment of a republic. In order to put this view to Metternich more partic u- larly, the king made use of James Rothschild. In th e middle of August, as a member of the Societe des An - tiquites, James was one of a deputation to congratu late Louis Philippe on ascending the throne. As the depu ta- tion was leaving, the king signaled to James to rem ain behind, and made the following remarks to him: \"Having seen the happiness that I enjoyed in the bo som of my family, such as accorded with my peaceful and entirely unambitious disposition, you know me too w ell to be deceived for a moment as to the state of mind in which I am approaching my present task. ... In givi ng up such a pleasant and carefree existence in order to mount to a throne set with dangers and difficulties , I have made an enormous sacrifice for my country. . . .

My most ardent desires are centered upon the peace of Europe, and I hope that the states wil l re- sume their former friendly relations with France, a nd come to have confidence in France's new government. \" 88 James saw to it that this was accurately conveyed t o Metternich at Vienna, and that the call to peace wa s properly emphasized. Meanwhile there were occurrences in Paris that thre at- ened further risings in various states of Europe. C ount- less emigrants from the period of the Neapolitan an d Spanish revolutions thought that the moment had com e for resuming their revolutionary activities. The Ro ths- childs knew some of these people and heard of their plans, and they did everything possible to induce t he new authorities in Paris to refrain from supporting the ir ef- forts. What, for instance, would be the fate of Nea poli- tan bonds, which had already slumped heavily, if Ge neral Pepe, who was staying in Paris, were, as Solomon pu t it, 89 \"again to arouse the spirit of the Carbonari\"? A rising was expected hourly in Spain. The Roths- childs immediately informed the newly constituted French government of everything that they heard of these activities, and through a common friend they also p ut Metternich in possession of such information. \"Count de Mole,\" 90 Solomon wrote to Vienna, 91 \"is well aware of all these activities, and has been en light- ened as to the importance of suppressing them in th e general interests of peace and of the tranquillity of France. He fully shares our convictions in this mat ter, and is applying all the means at his disposal to fr ustrate these unscrupulous schemes. I hope, my dear friend, that you will observe the strictest confidence in t he use you make of this communication. It was made to me under the seal of the strictest secrecy ... it woul d be exceedingly unpleasant for me if there were the sli ghtest suspicion that I had breathed a word about it. For this reason I am not signing this letter.\""},{"pageNumber":404,"pageContent":"398 The Rise of the House of Rothschild Owing to their excellent connections, the Rothschil ds were thus receiving the most important and confiden tial information in spite of the complete change in affa irs. The new king, Louis Philippe, and the bourgeois min is- ters who now received the seals of office had the g reatest interest themselves in seeing that peace was mainta ined, that law and order was restored, and that private p rop- erty was not interfered with. The aims of the Roths - childs were identical and they were to learn Louis Philippe's intentions from the best possible source , namely, the king himself. On September 7, 1830, James was received by Louis Philippe in private audience, and discussed the gen eral situation with him. \"My brother,\" Solomon reported thereon to Vienna, 92 \"yesterday had the opportunity of a leisured discussion with the King of France. The king said with regard to Austria, which was strengthenin g her forces in the Italian provinces, that she should no t go too far with her military preparations, as this alone w ould automatically lead to war in the end. My brother re p- resented to the king that he was not dealing firmly enough with the activities of the Spanish and Neapolitan e xiles in the heart of the capital itself, and that such l axity might produce the most pernicious results. The king re- plied that he was using every means in his power to frus- trate the agitators' schemes, but that his mandate as a constitutional monarch involved limitations which h e could not legally exceed. \"The king assured me that he was opposing revolutio n- aries in all countries as far as his position as a constitu- tional monarch allowed him to do, but he stated tha t he was compelled to show a certain regard for liberal as- pirations. \"'I should be exceedingly glad,' he said to James, 'if you could possibly be the means of communicating my views to his Highness Prince von Metternich, and re - quest him in his wisdom to make urgent representati ons"},{"pageNumber":405,"pageContent":"The House of Rothschild Rides the Storm. 399 to the court of Naples, so that it may be moved to make a few concessions in the general interests of the cou ntry, and in accordance with the progress of contemporary ideas.'\" Solomon skilfully incorporated in this letter, whic h he intended Metternich to read, a few flattering re marks about the chancellor, attributed to Louis Philippe. The letter concluded with the following words: \"Such, m y dear friend, are the essential points mentioned in my brother's conversation with the king. With the exce p- tion of certain highly placed persons, observe the strictest secrecy in regard to it, and accept again the assur ance of my most friendly sentiments.\" The fears that the revolutionary movement might spread prove to be well founded. The July revolutio n produced repercussions throughout Europe. Apart fro m minor disturbances in Germany, Italy and Spain, the re were serious risings leading to important results. The peoples of the kingdom of the United Netherlands, w hich had been welded together in 1815 without any consid era- tion of the diverse populations of Belgium and Holl and living within its boundaries, had long been restive . On August 25, 1830, revolution broke out in Brussels, as the result of which a change in the form of government, separation from the dynasty of Orange, and indeed t he severance of Belgium from Holland were demanded and soon afterwards achieved. This produced a severe cr isis in the commercial world, and increased the fears of a general European war, for news was received from bo th Vienna and St. Petersburg that the authorities were not merely determined to suppress these revolutionary u p- risings individually, but also proposing to use mil itary force against the new regime in France, as the bree ding- place of all these dangerous movements. Meanwhile Solomon had returned from Paris on a most important mission.

Solomon was to d o what he could in the way of direct written and verb al communications with the chancellor, and also to bri ng pressure to bear upon Gentz daily, while enlisting the influence of third persons whom he had placed under financial obligations. His brothers in London and P aris unceasingly urged him in their letters not to flag in his efforts. James wrote on November 24, 1830: 93 M Y D EAR B ROTHER : An Austrian courier will be passing through Frankfort, so I am taking this opportunity of writi ng to you. I hope that as Uncle [Metternich] will be back in Vienna, you will know more about what is happening. You know that Count Sebastiani, minis- ter for foreign affairs, has given me permission to call on him every morning. I am on the most friendl y terms with him, a fact which is not likely to be di s- pleasing to Uncle, as it enables me often to let yo u have advance news. He said to me, \"My dear Roths- child, the one question is, are the foreign powers seeking an excuse to declare war on the king? It will be a murderous one if they are, and God knows when and how it will end. We will leave nothing undone to preserve peace. We will do everything possible; and the king sent a man to Brussels yeste r- day to beg that the Nassau dynasty should not be ex - cluded, and to say that if it behaved foolishly it was at its own risk, as France would not interfere.\" Talleyrand has been written to in London to try and settle the question between Holland and Luxem- bourg.

Therefore, my"},{"pageNumber":407,"pageContent":"The House of Rothschild Rides the Storm 401 dear Solomon, do try to find out the position, for even though we are not carrying out any transaction in rentes, we have a holding of 900,000 rentes (i.e., 18 million francs nominal). If peace is preserved they will be worth 75%, while in case of war they will drop to 45. We should not be certain of dropping 25 to 36%, and I should say that we better go strai ght and secure ourselves. You have no idea what the position is here with regard to actual rentes. People are selling every d ay in England, and today I sold 25,000 francs again in London; but I see no real sellers, and in spite of all the military preparations, the rentiers are not get - ting nervous, because it is not consistent with san ity that the powers should now undermine industry, trade, and public credit through a war. Meanwhile, my dear Solomon, the whole world is arming, and this fact alarms me. They are already telling us here that they are going to station a de fense force of 300,000 men on the frontiers. Now experi- ence unfortunately teaches us that military prepara - tions very easily lead to war, and if anybody wants war we shall have it. Believe me, I feel sure that it depends now on the prince alone, and he can use the opportunity to influence France as he wishes. If Uncle wants peace and convinces our government that he does, we shall have peace; and he will cer- tainly have a firmer control over affairs here than he had in Polignac's time. For neither the ministry nor the chambers are, as has been supposed, ultra- liberal; indeed their views have been modified so much that they are much more inclined to royalism than in Polignac's time. You can see a proof of thi s in their way of dealing with the Spanish revolution - aries ; there are no more clubs or popular gatherin gs.

I beg you, if there is any news, send somebody to Strassburg, or send a specia l courier here, because it makes a great difference. We have been cautious enough to consolidate our posi- tion by realizing a large holding of rentes at a lo ss, and I am convinced that if peace is maintained, rentes will improve in three months by at least ten percent, since there is a shortage of actual rentes on the market, and the bear speculators require millio ns to cover. And it would be a very good thing to recover part of their ill-gotten gains from these wretched people, and this is just the moment for do - ing so. You yourself will see, my dear brother, how exceedingly important it is that I should have the earliest possible news of what we are to expect.

As the Bourse was closing it was stated that Laffitte 96 would make a speech on Monday demanding 500,000 men; not that France should intervene in Belgian affairs , but only for her own security. I spent a long time with Laffitte and Sebastiani. I have never known them so moderate. They said to me, \"We sent some- body to Brussels and they did not listen to us. Are we to set Europe ablaze in order to put Monsieur Merode on the Belgian throne? The powers are arming and we must do the same; we have bought 100,000 muskets in Hamburg; we have also bought munitions at Frankfort, as we must take precautions , and the interests of the powers are identical with ours.\" They said that they definitely believed that there would be no war; but the Belgian affair com- plicates everything very much. Good news is supposed to have been received from Russia. I shall probably send you a courier on Mon- day night or on Tuesday with the speech, if it is i m- portant and likely to be helpful. The moderates, such as Perier and all the rest are wild, and are screaming against Russia, saying that the publicati on of Emperor Nicholas's letter was an insult to the nation. You have no idea of the war spirit among these people; but it is clear that none of those in real authority wants war. Do tell the prince these things, my dear Solomon.

Solomon thereupon replied to James: 98 M Y D EAR B ROTHER : I have received your valued communication of November, and conveyed its contents to the prince. One may now infer that the French government must be principally concerned to secure its own position , and will therefore have no use for mere adventurers like Mole and Broglie. 99 On behalf of the prince, Solomon conveyed an assur- ance that he also desired peace, but that he would strike a blow in Italy, not against a power but against th e revolution which had to be fought everywhere in the interests of peace and order. If France permitted t his, it would not be troubled, and peace would be maintaine d; but if not, there would be war, in which case Austr ia would certainly not stand alone, for it would be in the interests of all governments to support the state w hich desired nothing but peace and order. \"I have also informed the prince of your inquiry,\" Solomon continued. \"If General Sebastiani wishes to say anything to him as man to man it is perfectly o pen to him to do so, either through you or through any par- ticular person in whom he has confidence.\""},{"pageNumber":411,"pageContent":"The House of Rothschild Rides the Storm 405 Metternich thus appointed the Rothschilds over the head of his Paris ambassador as the channel of comm uni- cation between him and the French cabinet.

CHAPTER III (1) In 1834, on the occasion of a dinner to a frien d, Nathan spoke about his career in England. This is described in t he Memoirs of Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton, Bart., edited by his son Char les Buxton, Esq. (London, 1848), pp. 333 and foll. It has been often quoted and reprinted, but we should bear in mind that an a ccount given by Nathan during a good dinner should not be taken too literally, and that it also had the object of increasing the; prestige of the House of Rothschild. Critically regarded, the account is worthy of considera- tion. (2) See Demachy and Les Rothschild, p. 168. ( 3) Mollien to Napoleon, Mar. 26, 1811.
