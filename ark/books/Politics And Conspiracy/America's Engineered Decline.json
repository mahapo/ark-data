Their ultimate goal is to create this hemispheric \"free trade \" area consolidating all of North and South America into some kind of \"United States of the Americas.\" ... This is a legitimate political issue, and it should be discussed and debated openly. Americans — the public at large as much as some of our policymakers — are letting this take place without a frank discussion. We are undergoing a radical change in our national character and social structure, and it shouldn 't be allowed to happen without at very least the informed consent of the public. I'm among those who believe that it shouldn't be allowed to happen, period — and I believe that this remains a majority view, which is probably why it's being done by stealth and misdirection. — Representative Tom Tancredo (R-Colorado). roponents of full hemispheric integration — economic and political — have targeted 2005 for the culmination of a sneak attack on the independe nce of America. Using the misleading bait of promoting prosperity, the powerful globalists supporting this scheme hope to entice our nation into a revolutionary trap — the cleverly misnamed Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA).

Accordingly, the publication of America's Engineered Decline comes as a very welcome event. Most Americans old enough to discern trends have be- come nervous about our nation's future. They recognize that our nation is plagued by problems with serious long-term consequences. Out-of-control immigration and manufacturing flight are but two of those problems examined in America's Engineered Decline. Unfortunately, the public doesn't know what to do about its concerns and generally looks to government for solutions. But, despite much posturing by politicians, the problems continue to get worse. For example, since 9-11, the public has made it particu- larly clear that it wants governm ent to enforce control of our borders and stem massive immigration. Yet, instead, we now hear of proposals for amnesty and further opening our borders. Why? Because, as William Norman Grigg shows, our government has been marching to a far different drum- mer than public opinion. As America's Engineered Decline demonstrates, the public's wishes are constantly frustrated because the public doesn't understand its competition for control of our own government. Most of us are busy with our personal affairs and accordingly not well informed about what our govern- ment is actually doing. We ar e prone to accept excuses and assurances from political leaders while the more diligent and better informed competition gets the results. America's Engineered Decline will help Americans correct that deficiency. It will help them understand the forces and agendas responsible for our nation's decline. But most importantly, Mr. Grigg's expose offers help in understanding and — we hope — blocking one of the most dangerous milestones in that decline: The Free Trade Area of the Americas."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"viii America's Engineered Decline The accelerated economic devastation and loss of polit- ical control promised by our entry into a Free Trade Areas of the Americas agreement would make it very difficult for Americans to reverse course later when they more clearly see the destination. If you l ove America and want to pass on a legacy of freedom and opportunity to future genera- tions, please read on. Then get others to do so as well. Most especially, we urge every reader to get involved in an organized drive to activate Congress to stop the FTAA. Defeating the FTAA would deliver a huge setback to the globalists seeking to fasten stifling socialism on the peo- ples of the world. Similarly, stopping the FTAA would strike a major blow in the longer struggle to restore consti- tutional government at home and promote freedom — the real basis for prosperity — thoughout the world. Blocking the FTAA is certainly a big challenge, but or- ganized opposition could well carry the day. Let's remem- ber that majorities don't change the course of history. De- termined minorities do. Determined minorities can still mo- bilize the power of public opinion, using the freedoms our Founding Fathers attempted to secure for us. Because of the urgency and timeliness of the FTAA threat, the publisher has shifted Mr. Grigg's examination of two other significant national threats — moral decline and perpetual war, which have less to do with the FTAA pro- posal itself — to appendices.

And little wonder that this hatred grew deeper as the middle class became stronger and imposed restrictions through which all the people, including the most humble, had the right to rule their own lives and keep the greater part of what they earn ed for themselves. Clearly, if the elite were to rule again, the middle class had to be destroyed.... For you see the elite of all nations, then as now, were not divided. They were one international class, and worked together and protected each other. But the middle class laughed and said, \"We will bind you with the chains of our Constitution, which you must obey also, lest we depose you, for we are now powerful and we are human beings and we wish to be free from your old despotism.\" — Taylor Caldwell 1 What does it do when you take away all these jobs from people who support families, who raise families? ... Manufacturing has been the strength of this country. If we can't make anything here anymore, what does that do? The fabric of this society is falling apart. — Jim Greathouse, 55, 30-year employee of a Hoover vacuum factory in Canton, Ohio, after losing his job in June 2003 2 We're basically liquidating our whole middle class, polarizing people on the two extremes, haves and have-nots....

The middle class is always a pain in the neck where government's concerned. It's where you find most of the people who complain about taxes, regulations, and other policies. If you wipe them out, you just have the ultra-rich and the poor — a perfect arrangement for a dictatorship. — Jerry Skoff, owner of Badger Tech Metals in Menomonee, Wisconsin 4 We were middle class,\" lamented former textile work-er Jimmy Bennett, before hastily correcting himself: \"We still are.\" Jimmy and his wife, Verleen, residents of Kan-napolis, North Carolina, were among the nearly 6,500 employees of the Pillowtex towel factory who were laid off in early August 2003. Just two years earlier, the Bennetts had bought a modest four-bedroom ranch house. After putting in a combined 43 years at the mill, working part-time jobs, and frugally managing their money, \"we had made it,\" Jimmy told a Washington Post re- porter. 5 But their thrift and industry weren't enough to save their jobs as Pillowtex — like much of America's textile industry — was deluged by a flood of cheap imports from China. Now the Bennetts and thousands of Pillowtex employees found themselves in an economic free-fall, shedding many of the middle-class amenities to which they had become accus- tomed. Many were left fending off foreclosures, eviction no- tices, or car repossessions. Luxur ies such as cable television and cell phones were jettisoned, and soon necessities were in jeopardy as well: Within weeks of the lay-off, more than 200 former employees had their water turned off. 6 "},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Race to the Bottom 3 Kannapolis means \"city of looms,\" and the town's textile mills offered steady employment to several generations. Many, if not most, of those who toiled in the mills had a high school education, supplemented with an admirable work ethic. When the looms fell silent, many of those workers were cresting mid- dle age, with families to support, and mortgages to pay. Some, like the Bennetts, quickly took any available jobs, even those at near-minimum wage. Others tried to find other textile jobs, or similar work in the manufacturing sector, but their prospects were less than encouraging — given the accelerating flight of manufacturing work abroad, particularly to China. According to Charles Bremer of the American Textile Man- ufacturers Institute, as textiles from Communist China and Vietnam flood the American market, \"People are moving jobs faster than you can count.\" In 2008, all import quotas on Chi- nese textiles will be removed. \"At that point,\" predicts Bremer, \"the Chinese will completely dominate the market.\" 7 Ironically, at least some of th e future textile imports from China will probably be produced on looms from Pillowtex's Kannapolis facility — but those looms will be in China, oper- ated by Chinese workers. As thousands of the company's workers scrambled to find new jobs, or to keep creditors at bay, brokers and investors scrambled to carve up the company's re- maining assets. The company's looms and other heavy ma- chinery were likely destined fo r China, Pakistan, or India. 8 Manufacturing in Decline The Kannapolis tragedy is merely a small snapshot of the gen- eral decline of America's manufacturing economy. \"While hundreds of factories close in any given year,\" ob- served the Wall Street Journal, \"something historic and fun- damentally different is occurring now. For manufacturing, this isn't a cyclical downturn. Most of these basic and low-skill factory jobs aren't liable to come back when the economy re- covers or when excess capacity around the world dissolves...."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"4 America's Engineered Decline [T]he task of making these [manufactured] goods is increas- ingly being assumed by more efficient machines and process- es. Or they've been transferre d to workers who earn less and live in another country.... By some estimates, roughly 1.3 mil- lion manufacturing jobs have moved abroad since the begin- ning of 1992, the bulk in the past three years [2000-2003] to Mexico and East Asia.\" 9 In a Labor Day speech in 2003 before union workers in Ohio — a state that shed 160,000 manufacturing jobs between 2000 and 2003 10 — President George W. Bush tried to play up the notion that the job losses reflected increases in productiv- ity, corporate greed and corruption, and the September 11th terrorist attacks. \"What productivity means is that we've got a lot of hard work and we're using new technologies to make people more effective when it comes to the job, and that's important,\" in- sisted the president. \"You see, in 1979, it took more than 40 hours of labor to make a car, and now it takes 18 hours. We're productive. Our workers are really productive in America.\" 11 It's certainly true that advances in technology have dra- matically improved American productivity. But the perspec- tive offered by President Bush perversely blames \"the most productive workers in the entire world\" for the dismal prospects that await them as manufacturing jobs evaporate. Furthermore, there is sound reason to believe that our nation's performance on the productivity front reflects not a healthy, streamlined economy, but the Fe deral Reserve's success in re- defining productivity for political reasons. \"The supposed rise in productivity was the silver lining in the economic cloud of the last three years,\" wrote New York Post economics analyst John Crudele in late 2003. \"Fed Chief Alan Greenspan has spoken proudly of it, saying the United States was becoming a more effi cient producer of goods. But a slip of a tongue may call the whole productivity miracle into question.\""},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Race to the Bottom 5 The wayward tongue in question belongs to Senator Robert Bennett (R-Utah), chairman of the Joint Economics Commit- tee. In a television interview, Bennett — apparently unaware of the implications of his comm ents — offered an off-the-cuff description of the Federal Reserve's Soviet-style redefinition of \"productivity\" in the mid-1990s: If you go back into the '90s and Alan Greenspan's ex- amination of where the economy was, the productivity numbers that he was getting through traditional means all indicated productivity was down. And Greenspan gathered the economists ... and the Fed t ogether and said this cannot be right.... They said, 'We are doing it the way we've always done it, so the numbers have to be right.' And [Greenspan] challenged them and said if you look at the other data they make it very clear that productivity has got to be going up. They went back and recalculated and discovered that their productivity numbers had been wrong for months if not years. 12 Here's how the process works, according to Crudele: \"The Fed Chairman doesn't like an economic statistic, so he tells some lowly economists to take a mulligan and do the calcula- tions over. Amazingly, they di scover exactly what the Fed wants them to discover — the politically important produc- tivity miracle.\" 13 Thus it's clear that productivity hasn't caused the dramatic reduction in the number of American manufacturing jobs. \"Outsourcing\" — sending work abroad to be done more cheaply by foreign workers — is a much likelier culprit. During the summer of 2003, ten plants operated by the Hooker Furniture Corporation were shuttered, leaving hun- dreds of people from several states unemployed. This was not an austerity measure, since the company's profits had actually increased during recent years — largely because it had start-"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"6 America's Engineered Decline ed to \"outsource\" its work to cheaper foreign manufacturers. 14 \"Every time we've asked them to step up, they've done it,\" commented Hooker CEO Paul Toms of the employees who lost their jobs. \"I feel like we've let these folks down, and I don't know what I'd do different .... It's unlike anything I've seen in my 21 years in the industry. A lot of plants have closed, people have been sent home, and it really has come quicker than anybody expected. I think it's hard to say, three, four, five years from now, what this industry will look like domestical- ly.\" 15 As with the American textile i ndustry, the U.S. furniture in- dustry has been decimated in uneven competition with low- wage nations like Communist China. The Chin ese \"have mil- lions of people that they're trying to have employed so it's hard to fault them,\" Toms opines. \"But I think that at some point, this country has to think about what's best for us.... You have industries and examples of pred atory pricing. That's the risk we run not just in furniture, but in any industry that we're let- ting leave this country.\" 16 According to Andrew Brod, an economic analyst in Ker- nersville, North Carolina (where Hooker closed a plant for- merly employing hundreds), many American companies, rather than making capital investments in the U.S., have de- cided to \"funnel investments abroad, many to China itself...\" \"Some have contracted with Chinese producers, but others have entered into joint ventures to establish new factories [and] to refurbish existing factories,\" Brod observed. 17 The closing of the Kernersville Hooker plant had immedi- ate local economic impact. \"If I don't work, I can't go out and spend money to shop or buy what I need, so that's going to put somebody else in jeopardy,\" former Hooker employee Mildred Stiles pointed out. Rather than being \"that trickle-down thing,\" she continued, \"I think it's goi ng to be more of a pour-down.... I think it's going to hurt everybody concerned.\" 18 In some economic circles, th e phenomenon she describes"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Race to the Bottom 7 is called the \"race to the bottom\" — the sudden precipitous de- cline of an entire population from the middle class to near-sub- sistence living. Our nation's manufacturing sector has been the gateway to the middle class for untold millions of Americans, resulting in unprecedented national prosper ity. What will America look like if manufacturing jobs conti nue to be \"outsourced\" to low- wage foreign competitors? Surveying Kernersville's grim eco- nomic prospects, Brod declares: \"In part, the answer to that question is, 'What sort of America do you see now?' It's here already.\" 19 De-industrializing the U.S. \"We're killing ourselves,\" lament s Jerry Skoff, owner of a Wis- consin manufacturing firm and member of Save Our Ameri- can Manufacturing (SAM). \"Bombs are falling, but people aren't paying attention. We're being reduced from a manufac- turing and hi-tech economy into a service economy — and if things continue the way they are, the service sector will even- tually go the same direction.\" 20 As noted in the previously cited Wall Street Journal story, once manufacturing jobs are \"outsourced\" to low-wage coun- tries, they almost certainly won't be coming back. Further- more, the process of exporting industrial jobs necessarily en- tails de-industrializing the U.S. — and this cycle can become self-sustaining. \"Once tooling capacity is lost, manufacturing simply has to move,\" observes John C. McCoy, owner of Omnitech Techni- cal Associates in Washington State. \"People running compa- nies in this country generally don't want to go offshore. But once the process got started, it snowballed, because the spe- cialized tooling capacity started to shut down — and it takes a long time to re-tool, too long to remain competitive in this globalized economy.\" As the U.S. loses its manufacturing capacity, continued Mc-"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"8 America's Engineered Decline Coy, \"China is being set up as the center of global manufac- turing. They have a huge supply of cheap labor, cheap power, and very modern production facilities. Many, perhaps even most, of the Chinese-made products being unloaded on our docks and reaching our store shelves are assembled in auto- mated plants, and dropped into shipping boxes without ever being touched by human hands.\" Many of those ultra-modern Chinese plants have been built by Japanese firms, but others have been built in recent year s by U.S.-based multinational corporations. 21 China's state-controlled economy rests on a foundation of low-wage and outright slave labor. This offers radical advan- tages to Chinese firms in their competition with U.S. manu- facturers. It also provides the regime with a gusher of revenue it can use to subsidize key industries — in some instances, de- stroying American competition. Jay Bender, owner of Falcon Plastics in Brookings, South Dakota, has described how a key customer — a manufacturer of fishing lures — moved its production base from the U.S. to China. Prior to making the move, the customer asked Bender to make a bid on molds used to make the lures. Bender bid $25,000 per mold; the Chinese counter-offer was $3,000 apiece. \"I can't even buy raw materials for that,\" Bender protested. \"There are two possibilities: Either they are subsi- dized by the government, or they gave away the molds to get the manufacturing business.\" In order to remain in business, Bender had to lay off nearly one-third of his workforce. 22 There's also a severe price to be paid for relocating manu- facturing to China, however. \"Every firm that sets up for production in China has to turn over its technology,\" notes Jerry Skoff. \"Intellectual property theft by the Chinese is very common. And any investment banker familiar with the Chinese system will tell people preparing to set up over there that they should pad their ex- penses by at least forty percent to allow for the graft, bribes,"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Race to the Bottom 9 and other payoffs involved in doing business over there.\" 23 Nonetheless, U.S. firms continue to \"outsource\" their manu- facturing to China. A multi-institutional academic study compiled in 2001 re- ported: \"In the months since th e enactment of Permanent Nor- mal Trade Relations (PNTR) legislation with China there has been an escalation of production shifts out of the U.S. and into China.... [B]etween October 1, 2000 and April 30, 2001 more than eighty corporations announced their intentions to shift production to China....\" Accordin g to the study, \"as many as 760,000 U.S. jobs have been lost due to the U.S.-China trade deficit since 1992,\" with a comparable number of jobs disap- pearing as the result of \"outsourcing\" to Mexico. \"The em- ployment effects of these production shifts go well beyond the individual workers whose jobs were lost,\" continues the report. \"Each time another company shuts down operations and moves work to China, Mexico, or any other country, it has a ripple effect on the wages of every other worker in that indus- try\" — in other words, accelerating the \"race to the bottom.\" 24 Strategic Vulnerability Building Beijing's industrial capacity at U.S. expense obvi- ously poses other serious problems — not the least of which is the strategic threat to the U.S. posed by the Communist be- hemoth. The case of Magnequench, an electronics firm in Val- paraiso, Indiana, illustrates the interconnected economic and strategic aspects of \"outsourcing\" to China. In 1995, Magnequench was bought by a business consor- tium including Chinese interests. A few years later, the con- sortium announced its intention to relocate the plant to China — a move that would deprive the small community of 225 well-paying manufacturing jobs. Just as importantly, it would provide Beijing with a key military technology: Magnequench makes 80 percent of the rare ear th magnets used in American \"smart bomb\" technology. 25 "},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"10 America's Engineered Decline As the Magnequench example illustrates, the erosion of the U.S. industrial base \"has enormous national security implica- tions,\" observed National Defense magazine. \"It has made the United States so dependent on foreign countries for critical components and systems that it may have lost its ability to con- trol its supply chains. The United States is becoming depend- ent on countries such as China, India, Russia, France and Ger- many for critical weapons technology. It's conceivable that one of these governments could tell its local suppliers not to sell critical components to the Un ited States because they do not agree with U.S. foreign policy.\" 26 Business analyst Barry Lynn points out that many of Amer- ica's premier corporations — including key defense-related firms — now consider themselves to be \"virtual companies\" depending on a complex and widely dispersed network of sup- pliers around the world. Dell Computer, for example, assem- bles its computers out of 4,500 parts manufactured in various Asian countries, including Communist China. Dell — an im- portant defense contractor — maintains an inventory sufficient foT only four days' production. If its supply line were inter- rupted for more than 96 hours, Dell's Texas plants would cease production. 27 Simply put, \"the U.S. industrial base is being taken apart, piece-by-piece, and relocated to other nations,\" conclude trade analysts Pat Choate and Edward Miller. \"In the process, much of America's industrial and military production base is being sold to foreign interests, and more importantly a significant portion of it is being physically relocated into other nations, including our most likely strategic rival — China.\" 28 For more than a century and a half, America's manufactur- ing economy attracted hard-working people from around the world who were eager to beco me Americans. Manufacturing jobs not only enabled these new arrivals to get on the ladder to the middle class, but helped them to assimilate into our na- tion's civic culture. But as former Treasury Department offi-"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Race to the Bottom 11 cial Paul Craig Roberts points out, \"The loss of high produc- tivity jobs takes away the ladders of upward mobility and wipes out human capital.\" As our manufacturing base is being stripped away, Ameri- cans may someday find it necessary to emigrate in order to find manufacturing jobs. No Americans Need Apply It's a short step from outsourcing manufacturing jobs to China, to outsourcing American worker s there. And it's not just factory workers who may someday have to take such drastic steps to preserve their livelihoods. Americans in hi-tech, \"in- formation age\" positions are seeing their jobs disappear as well. Daniel Soong graduated from S acramento State University in 1995 with a degree in computer science. An avid \"computer geek\" from the earliest age, Soong entered the job market at the peak of the info-tech boom. Fresh out of college he got a position with computer chip maker Intel. Two years later he snagged his \"dream job\" as a traveling consultant for Boston- based PriceWaterhouseCoopers. In 1999 he went back to California to work for a \"dot-com\" start-up, but the venture quickly folded. But this didn't discourage Soong: \"My skills were in demand.\" He eventually landed a position with Ac- centure, an East Coast investment firm. And then the \"outsourcing\" began. \"I was in a building with 500 people,\" recalls Soong. \"Then they started to offshore. Nine months later we were down to 50 people.\" Desperate to find a stable job, Soong seemingly found one with ChevronTexaco, working on a project in San Ramon, California. Hoping that his six-month contract would grow into a full-time position, Soong noticed something dis- turbing: The project employed a large — a growing — num- ber of foreign workers in the U.S. on H-1B and L-1 visas. Rather than training American employees, Soong and his"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"12 America's Engineered Decline fellow consultants were training guest workers and offshore personnel. And through a slow, steady, but subtle process of attrition, the Americans were be ing let go. At the end of each two-week pay period, a score or so of the American workers would receive their pink slips. In January 2003, Soong — halfway through his six-month, $60,000 contract — was called into a meeting with two senior corporate personnel, and sternly told that his performance was inadequate. \"I told them my program works great, I had trained everyone, and my full -time ChevronTexaco manager can back me up,\" Soong relates. 'The room was silent for a minute.... Then they just came up with another excuse.\" Like so many others in the tech field — engineers, pro- grammers, software designers — Soong found that his job had been outsourced — and that the company had used him to train his foreign replacements. The most tragic case of this sort in- volved Kevin Flanagan, a programmer for Bank of America (and former Chevron employee) who shot himself to death in May 2003 after being forced to train his replacement employee from India. 29 \"Soong began looking for work, but he soon realized the job market had changed,\" related CIO Magazine. \"No one he knew could find a job.\" Referred to a position in Texas, Soong arranged a telephone interview, on ly to be hung up on \"after 15 seconds.\" His friends informed him that the company \"only interviewed Americans to be in compliance with the equal op- portunity employment commission, and that no Americans were ever hired.\" 30 By taking piecework (usually for $10 an hour), Soong was able to pay his bills. He continued to make his daily rounds of employment agencies, and to show up for job interviews, but he became convinced that the interviews were perfunctory ges- tures made by companies bent on sending the work offshore. Soong eventually decided to send his resume abroad in hopes of finding work in his field. \"It would be really inter-"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Race to the Bottom 13 esting to work in Bangalore [India],\" he mused. \"But I was told, 'Daniel, it is against the law for you to work here. You can come here on vacation, but you can't work here.' \" 31 Experiences of mis sort have become heartbreakingly com- mon across the Jength and breadth of America's hi-tech sector. William F. Jasper, Senior Editor for The New American maga- zine, described the Dickensian sc ene that unfolded at the Austin headquarters of Dell Computers just two weeks before Christ- mas 2002. Hundreds of Dell employees gathered for a \"town hall\" meeting at the Austin campus, ill prepared for the message that senior vice president Jeff Clarke was about to deliver: Meetings of this sort were usually big on awards, recog- nition, and introductions of new products and project teams. And despite the market drubbing of tech stocks in general, Dell had posted anot her banner year in sales, growth, and profits. The company also benefitted from a nice cash balance, Mr. Clarke noted. Then came the bad news. The company was announcing new personnel 'attrition goals' of 10 percent per year, about double the normal attrition rate. These positions would not be filled in the United States, Clarke explained. They would be filled by new hires in India, China, and other countries where Dell is shifting business. \"Audible gasps came from the employee audience, a hi-tech assemblage of Dell software engineers, electrical engineers, test engineers, group managers, and administrative talent,\" continued Jasper's account. \"A Dell employee who attended the meeting told The New American: 'A definite pall came over the crowd. It did not make for a happy Christmas.'\" There had been portents of such a development at Dell since 2000, when Dell opened its China Design Centre in Commu- nist China. Shortly thereafter began a \"steady trickle of Red Chinese engineers, project pla nners, and managers ... brought"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"14 America's Engineered Decline to Dell's Austin campus for training, and some U.S. Dell em- ployees [began making] the trek to China for four-to-six-month stints to train Chinese personnel there. Around the Dell head- quarters in Austin, employees had begun wryly referring to the 'Chinese invasion' as 'training our replacements.' Few ex- pected that the replaci ng would start so soon.\" 32 \"Jobs that stay put are becomi ng a lot harder to find these days,\" observed Time magazine in mid-2003. \"U.S. companies are expected to send 3.3 million jobs overseas in the next 12 years, primarily to India, according to a study by Forrester Re- search. If you've ever called De ll about a sick PC or Ameri- can Express about an error on your bill, you have already bumped the tip of this 'offshore outsourcing' iceberg. The friendly voice that answered your questions was probably a customer-service rep in Bangalore or New Delhi. Those rela- tively low-skilled jobs were the first to go, starting in 1997. But more and more of the jobs that are moving abroad are highly skilled and highly paid — the type that U.S. workers assumed would always remain at home.\" 33 \"No longer is it just Disney toys and Nike shoes made in Haiti and Indonesia,\" added the Christian Science Monitor. \"It's software engineering, accounting, and product develop- ment being 'outsourced' to India, the Philippines, Russia, and China.\" As with the exodus of manufacturing jobs, the outsourcing of Information Technology jobs may have permanent conse- quences for our nation's economic and technical standing. Basheer Janjua, who presides over Integnology Corp, a firm specializing in domestic outsourcing, points out that U.S. cor- porations who outsource IT jobs are training the workforces of our future economic (and, in China's case, strategic) com- petitors. \"What's going to be the incentive for our future gen- erations to get a degree in electrical engineering?\" asks Jan- jua. \"We have to ask if we're ready to give up our pioneering position in the world.\" 34 "},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Race to the Bottom 15 The Dream Is Dying We need to ask some even more elemental questions. If Americans aren't making anything, how will they be able to make a living? Is it possible to maintain a middle-class stan- dard of living in a service-based economy? Given that (as we'll examine in a later chapter) our nation is importing a third-world population even as it outsources our jobs, will there soon be any service-economy jobs left for Americans to occupy? Although Americans are glutted on cheap consumer goods, their standard of living — measured in tangible wealth that can be transmitted to their heirs — has declined precipitously dur- ing the last thirty years. \"A short generation ago, the greatest country on the face of the earth realized an impossible dream: America put a man on the moon,\" wrote political analysts Louis T.

Anytime in American history before the 1970s, the average worker — farmer, stevedore or salesman, it didn't matter — could support his family better and better with each ensuing generation. Nowa- days most people find supporting a family on one income is just about as difficult as going to the moon.\" \"Educated young people look longer and harder for jobs,\" continue March and Nelson. \"Veteran workers find no security in seniority — or in their pension funds. Multinational cor- porations increasingly treat their employees like equipment — with minimum maintenance, lower operating costs, built in ob- solescence and cheap off-sh ore replacements.... Nowadays when pink slips appear, retraining and counseling programs are the solution. Those fortunate enough to keep their jobs re- ceive lower, adjusted-for-inflation pay than the previous gen- eration. This has been the trend since 1973 — there is some- thing dreadfully, dreadfully wrong.\" 35 "},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"16 America's Engineered Decline The Debt Monster Looming behind this disheartening trend is a mountainous ac- cumulation of household consumer debt. \"A generation ago, a typical American middle-class family lived on the income of a single breadwinner,\" noted a USA Today front-page story. \"In recent years it has taken two work- ing spouses to live the middle-class dream. Now, it seems even that is not enough to survive the skyrocketing cost of housing, health care and college while saving for retirement and shoul- dering growing debt loads.\" Although most middle-income families are burdened with credit-card debt, the typical Amer ican family doesn't splurge on designer clothes, exotic travel, gourmet food, or other ex- travagances. Instead, they \"are using credit cards to fill in a gap between their income and their costs,\" according to fi- nancial counselor Tamara Draut. \"It's more about maintaining their standard of living than frivolous consumption.\" 36 Not surprisingly, the combination of widespread consumer debt and a contracting job market has produced an unprece- dented number of bankruptcies. According to the Consumer Bankruptcy Project at Harvard University, approximately one- third of families who file for bankruptcy owed an entire year's salary on their credit cards. And while credit card debt de- clined modestly in 2001, this was achieved mainly by trading high-interest credit card debt for lower-rate home equity loans. But home refinancing — one of the faltering pillars of Amer- ica's consumer economy — compounds, rather than solves, the problem of household debt by putting homes at risk. 37 As with credit card debt, home equity loans and second (and third) mortgages are being used by many households to make ends meet. In a study of the \"mortgage-refinancing binge\" of the early 2000s, Dr. Kurt Richebacher examined \"the pattern of consumer spending from 2002's first quarter to 2003's first quarter.

In Baby Boom-era America, \"burning the mortgage\" \"was a rite of passage to true financial independence\"; it sym- bolized the family's liberation from debt. But now \"the Amer- ican home is just one more credit line to be tapped,\" continues Morrow. \"Moreover, at some point, we will exhaust the sup- ply of money available using homes as collateral.\" 39 According to Morrow, the U.S. debt bubble reflects the cor- rupting influence of \"government subsidies, value-free mod- ern finance, and globalization.\" Federal intervention in mort- gage markets \"encourage[s] people to overextend by making borrowing cheaper than it otherwise would be. As always, when government subsidizes something, we get too much.\" Globalization has abetted the growth of the bubble economy by financing government debt: \"Without foreign buyers [of debt, both private and government], the wave of cash-out re- financing and home equity loans would reverse, and we would return to the normal mode of gradually paying down mort- gages.\" 40 Eventually, the bubble will burst. It simply has to. \"Home- buyers depend on their jobs to make their mortgage payments, and the economic contraction caused by a squeeze on con- sumer spending will put those jobs in jeopardy,\" Morrow warns. And as we've seen, the jobs on which those homes de- pend are being sent abroad. Thus it's not surprising that as our nation's manufacturing base has shrunk, mortgage delinquen- cies and foreclosures have accumulated at an unprecedented rate. 41 At the same time, the federal government is accumulating unprecedented debts — a $600 billi on annual deficit, and a na- tional debt approaching seven trillion dollars.

Christopher Wood of Credit Lyonnais Securities Asia in Hong Kong foresees the im- pending inflationary collapse of the dollar. \"So long as America continues to secure easy funding, there is no pressure on policymakers in Washington to do anything other than run super-easy policies to try to keep their own con- sumer credit cycle going,\" Wood wrote in a 2003 overview of the global economy. \"The current trend can continue for a while.... But the longer American excesses are financed, the more inevitable will be the ultimate collapse of the U.S. pa- per-dollar standard....

Hyperinflation in the 1920s wiped out the German middle class, clear ing the field for the rise of National Socialism. A plausible variation of that doomsday scenario, Morrow suggests, would be \"polarization of the American political system betw een those serving the interests of foreign creditors and those representing American mort- gage-holders.\" 44 In brief, our current course will lead to abolition of both the middle class and our national independence.

And as the regulatory leviathan grows, it increasingly sucks up revenue, resources, and manpower that otherwise would be invested in productive pursuits — thereby driving an increasing number of business- men and investors offshore. Many — perhaps even most — of the U.S. businesses that relocate production offshore are run by people who would pre- fer to keep the work here at home. Some companies — such as Wisconsin-based engine manufacturer Briggs & Stratton — have actually done battle with th e regulatory behemoth in the interest of saving jobs in this country. In September 2003, Briggs & Stratton Co., which produces small engines (such as those found in lawn mowers and gen- erators), tried to beat back a regulatory assault that would have cost tens of thousands of Americans their jobs. The California State government proposed a new pollution standard requiring small-engine manufacturers to put catalytic converters on"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Banishing Businesses 25 their motors beginning in 2020. \"We could not do that eco- nomically here,\" protested Briggs & Stratton senior vice pres- ident Thomas Savage, warning that re-tooling to meet the stan- dard would probably result in outsourcing the work overseas. 5 That warning caught the ear of Wisconsin Senator Herbert Kohl. Although a liberal Democrat, Kohl also relies heavily on the support of blue-collar industrial voters in a state whose manufacturing base has been radi cally eroded over the past decade. Accordingly, Kohl sudde nly displayed an unusual (for him) skepticism regarding the value of environmental regula- tion. \"In this economy in which 2.5 million manufacturing jobs have been lost, including 75,000 in Wisconsin, regulations that will force more jobs overseas need additional scrutiny,\" Kohl declared. 6 The impact of the envisioned outsourcing by Briggs & Stratton would have been felt in nearly half the states of our union: According to a study released by the company, 22,000 jobs in 24 states would be lost were the new standard to be im- posed by California. And the relocation would have an impact far beyond the company's payroll. \"California is attempting to impose unreasonable standards that force us to consider mov- ing operations overseas, and this would have a tremendous im- pact not only on our workers but on our suppliers and cus- tomers,\" company V.P. Thomas Savage explained. 7 Savage further noted that Briggs is \"one of the last re- maining U.S. manufacturers of small engines and [we're] do- ing everything we can to keep good high-tech manufacturing jobs from moving overseas.\" This included making a counter- proposal to the California Air Resources Board \"that would reach a level of emissions reductions comparable to CARB's own proposal, but without the high costs and potential job losses.\" Unfortunately, Briggs' attempt at conciliation also included supporting a congressional measure promoting \"a uniform national emissions standard set by EPA.

Briggs & Stratton succeeded in getting a U.S. Senate com- mittee to block implementation of the California air quality rule. This prompted the Clear Air Trust — a prominent mem- ber of the huge, foundation-funded Establishment environ- mentalist lobby — to demand that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigate the company for supposedly misrepresenting its financial status in an official report. 9 In a filing with the SEC, Briggs said that it did not believe the proposed California air quality rule \"will have a material effect on its financial condition or results of operations....\" Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), a proponent of the pro- posed rule, denounced Briggs for its \"unsavory\" tactics: \"They are either not telling the truth [in their SEC filing] ... or they are not telling the truth to the American people, or specifically the Senate.\" 10 In fact, Feinstein and her eco-ra dical allies, in their eager- ness to punish Briggs & Stratton for impeding the regulatory juggernaut, were engaged in deli berate misrepresentation: The company didn't stand to lose money if it relocated the jobs off- shore. At issue was the financial health of the company's American workers, not the company itself. \"Can Briggs & Stratton live with California's proposed reg- ulation? Yes,\" observed Ernie Blazar, a spokesman for Sena- tor Kit Bond (R-Mo.). \"But that would require moving almost 2,000 good-paying jobs from Missouri to other countries....\" \"We never said that we would lose money, and we never said that in our filing with the SEC,\" explained Briggs vice presi- dent Savage. \"What we said ... is this California action would have terrible effects on the employees.\" 11 "},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Banishing Businesses 27 This episode offers a revealing glimpse of the process that has led many American companies to \"outsource\" their pro- duction abroad. Too often, news coverage of such corporate decisions is designed to portra y corporate leaders as greedy, unpatriotic opportunists who are clinically indifferent regard- ing the welfare of their employees. More often than not, how- ever, those decisions are driven by government policies that make it economically impossible for companies to remain in the U.S. Indeed, the Briggs & Stratton episode illustrates that government overregulation of business is the single largest im- pediment to economic competitiveness. It's also very instructive to note the reaction provoked by Briggs & Stratton's refusal to play by the accepted script. For fighting on behalf of its employees, the company was threat- ened with a bogus SEC investigation — a potential corporate death sentence in the post-Enron era. But this is actually fairly typical of the behavior of the federal regulatory leviathan, which often seems to have been given the task of job extermi- nation as its prime directive. The Regulatory Burden H. Ross Perot memorably described low wage rates abroad as creating a \"giant sucking sound\" — the metaphorical sound of industrial jobs being drawn abroad. But while low wage rates \"suck\" U.S. jobs overseas, the ever-growing quantity of fed- eral regulations pushes them abroad just as vigorously. The regulatory burden on small businesses (fewer than 500 employees) is particularly staggering: $6,957 per employee. In 2003, thousands of new state laws — many of them in- tended to carry out federal mandates — went into effect, 1,000 of them in California alone. 12 In 1996, the year Congress passed the \"Red Tape Reduction Act,\" the estimated cost of regulatory compliance for small businesses was $700 billion annually. 13 By 2003 — seven years after this small business \"relief"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"28 America's Engineered Decline package was passed amid great fanfare — that figure had risen to $860 billion, or eight percent of our gross domestic prod- uct. The Federal Register, which compiles the regulations is- sued every single day by federal regulatory agencies, expanded to 75,606 pages; compare that total with 9,562 pages in 1950, 20,036 in 1970, and 49,795 in 1990. 14 It should be noted that the Register is formatted in double-column pages filled with small type, and that each page is generated by executive branch bureaucrats whose pronouncements supposedly have the force of law. How onerous is this accumulated body of regulations? Con- sider this: Several U.S. businessmen who have launched en- terprises in Communist China reportedly told a financial com- mentator that \"It is so much easier to start a business in China than in the United States, es pecially in places like Massachu- setts and California.\" 15 And even when aspiring entrepreneurs succeed in starting businesses, the crush of regulation often makes it difficult to run a profit. This is particularly true even if the costs of regulation are passed on to consumers, as they inevitably must be. Many critics of \"outsourcing\" insist that the trend is a re- flection of corporate greed and pathetic foreign wages. How- ever, as a study compiled by the National Association of Man- ufacturers (NAM) documents, the federal regulatory burden is the single most important factor behind the exodus of jobs from the U.S. \"U.S. manufacturing has demonstrated the ability to over- come pure wage differentials with trading partners through in- novation, capital investment and productivity,\" comments James Berges, president of Emerson (a St. Louis-based man- ufacturer of industrial equipment). \"But when the additional external costs [of federal regulation] are piled on, the task be- comes unmanageable, even in the best companies.\" 16 Simply put: Many, or even most, American businessmen who relocate abroad aren't ab andoning our nation.

Using a standardized measurem ent called unit labor costs, the NAM report compares U.S. industrial competitiveness with that of our nine biggest trading partners: Canada, Mexico, Japan, China, Germany, Brita in, South Korea, Taiwan, and France. This approach allowed researchers to calculate gov- ernment-imposed \"structural costs\" on manufacturing in each country. According to the report, \"domestically imposed costs — by omission or commission of federal, state, and local govern- ments — are damaging manufacturing more than any foreign competitor and adding at least 22.4 percent to the cost of do- ing business from the United St ates.... Once these underlying cost pressures are understood, it becomes clearer why much of U.S. production is moving offshore.\" In fact, the report as- serts, \"the absolute value of the excess cost burden on U.S. Banishing Businesses 29 Growth in Federal Register"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"30 America's Engineered Decline manufacturers ... is almost as la rge as the total raw cost index for China.\" 17 NAM highlights five \"critical obstacles\" to economic re- covery in the manufacturing sector: • Excessive corporate taxation. • Escalating costs of health and pension benefits. • Escalating costs of actual or threatened tort litigation. • Escalating compliance costs for regulatory mandates, par- ticularly those related to workplace safety, pollution abatement, and corp orate governance. • Rising energy costs, particularly natural gas. 18 Of these factors, the cost of regulatory compliance is the most lethal. \"Compliance costs for regulations can be regard- ed as the 'silent killer' of manufacturing competitiveness,\" ob- serves NAM. \"Often developed wi thout an objective cost-ben- efit analysis, regulations have steadily increased in quantity and complexity, regardless of which political party controls the executive branch.\" A \"reasonable estimate\" of the costs in- flicted by economic, environm ental, workplace, and tax com- pliance regulations \"is in the order of $850 billion — with $160 billion on manufacturers alone, equivalent to a 12 per- cent excise tax on manufacturing production.\" 19 Economist Clyde Wayne Crews Jr. of the CATO Institute points out that \"U.S. regulatory costs ... exceed the output of many entire national economies.... U.S. regulatory costs ex- ceed the entire 2000 GDP of Canada, which stood at $701 bil- lion. The regulatory burden also exceeded Mexico's GDP of $574 billion.\" Estimated federal regulatory costs also exceeded the total of pre-tax corporate profits in 2001 ($699 billion). With U.S. regulatory costs exceeding the GDP of both our \"NAFTA partners,\" and dwarfing total corporate profits, it's not surprising that overburdened American businessmen would be driven abroad in search of more business-friendly environ- ments. Regulatory costs on small businesses are often referred to"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Banishing Businesses 31 as a \"hidden tax\" — but this particular tax has a huge and dev- astating ripple effect. As cheaper foreign goods become more available, an increasing number of Americans simply forgo paying the hidden cost of government regulation by choosing less expensive imports. This makes economic sense to con- sumers, at least in the short term. But it also contributes to the outsourcing of production — and jobs — to other countries, which in turn undermines our nation's long-term economic health. The \"Fourth Branch\" of Government The federal regulatory apparatus is often described as the \"fourth branch of government. \" In fact, as economics com- mentator Warren L. McFerran observes, the regulatory agen- cies compose \"an entirely separate and independent govern- ment, complete with legislative, executive, and judicial pow- er.\" Unelected and unaccountable regulators not only devise their own \"laws,\" but are also \"empowered to enforce their own rules and act as the accusers against violators [and] function as judge and jury in cases involving their own rules.\" 20 As the foregoing cost estimates illustrate, the \"fourth branch\" also imposes taxes. Economist Crews refers to regu- lation as \"off-budget taxation,\" one of three methods used by the federal government to pay the costs of its programs. The first two, obviously, are direct taxation and borrowing (which contributes to inflation, which is a particularly insidious form of indirect taxation). Through regulation, \"rather than pay[ing] directly and book[ing] the expense of a new initiative, [gov- ernment] can require that the private sector and lower-level governments pay.... That process sometimes allows Congress to escape accountability and to blame agencies for costs.\" 21 This process has also produced a shadow government within our nation that combines legislative, executive, and judicial power. James Madison, in The Federalist Papers (essay 47), warned that combining those functions in the same hands \"may"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"32 America's Engineered Decline justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny.\" To this indictment of the \"fourth branch\" must be added the recogni- tion that this illegitimate, unaccountable \"shadow government\" exercises taxing powers at least equal to that of the legitimate national government. Another factor driving businesses abroad is our nation's out-of-control system of tort litigation. In 2001, the costs of the U.S. tort system climbed to $205 billion, \"or just over 2 percent of GDP,\" comments the NAM report. \"At least one- third of this increase has been due to an upward reassessment of liabilities associated with asbestos claims.\" 22 Asbestos lit- igation was an outgrowth of the 1986 Hazard Emergency Re- sponse Act, signed into law by President Ronald Reagan, re- quiring the removal of asbestos in public school buildings. Three years later the Environmen tal Protection Agency issued regulations effectively banning most uses of asbestos in both public and private buildings by 1997. Granted, asbestos does pose a public health risk, albeit a relatively moderate one: Constant exposure to significant lev- els of inhalable asbestos dust can contribute to grave respira- tory ailments, includi ng cancer. Those risks were dramatically increased by federal policies mandating the removal of as- bestos, which disbursed large quantities of asbestos into the air at each affected site. Notes analyst Michael Fumento, \"the risk of disease from asbestos in buildings is close to zero.\" 24 However, a manufactured frenzy that exaggerated the risks of asbestos led to an immensely expensive and utterly counter- productive national drive to remove it from buildings — a cam- paign that also whetted the destructive appetite of the tort lit- igation industry. The economic damage inflicted by the eco-leviathan is hardly limited to asbestos abatement. NAM points out that \"pollution abatement falls disproportionately on the shoulders of manufacturers,\" who accounted for 83 percent of pollution abatement expenditures in 1999. \"On a trade-weighted basis,\""},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Banishing Businesses 33 observes the report, \"the burden of pollution abatement ex- penditures alone reduces U.S. cost competitiveness by at least 3.5 percentage points.\" Of our nine largest economic com- petitors, only South Korea spends more on pollution abate- ment as a percentage of GDP; this is true even of the so-called \"green\" economies of the European Union. 24 Congressional Abdication Regulation is a particularly insidious and destructive form of taxation. And it is almost always imposed by faceless, unac- countable bureaucrats, rather than being passed by congress- men who must face the voters and pay the political price of their decisions. As economist Crews points ou t, \"Whatever measures Congress uses to address the regulatory state, dealing with the root of the problem requires ending excessive del- egation, or 'regulation without representation.' Congress should not have bureaucrats to blame for regulatory excess that is Congress's fault.\" 25 During the late 1990s proposals were made to require Con- gress \"to OK significant agency rules via an expedited process before they are binding,\" Crews continues. \"Article 1 of the Constitution grants legislative power solely to Congress. In that vein, major agency regulations should be turned into bills requiring congressional passage and a presidential signature — no more or less than ordinary legislation. Sensible regula- tory policy, as well as constitutional government, demands that every elected representative be on record for significantly costly regulations. Some might complain that voting on regulations would bog down Congress. But do we want Washington making so many laws that lawmakers can't even pass them all during their waking hours?\" 26 Actually, having Congress get bogged down in the process of enacting new regulations would be a very desirable out- come: The longer Congress takes to pass such bills, the like- lier that they will wither and die before becoming laws; few-"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"34 America's Engineered Decline er laws means a reduction in the \"hidden tax\" that is suffocat- ing our business economy and steadily undermining our stan- dard of living.

The proposed FTAA quickly earned the exuberant ap- proval from both Republicans and moderate Democrats. Es- tablishment conservatives insisted that the FTAA would be an unalloyed triumph for the free market; many Democrats echoed these assurances as well. But this assessment fails to account for the Bush adminis- tration's apparently contradictor y endorsement of international socialism. \"The United States' funding for international basic education assistance programs this year will be over 45 percent higher than last year,\" boasted the president in the same World Affairs Council address. \"And this spring, the first of our regional teacher training centers will open in Jamaica.

Free trade is an exchange of goods and services between two parties, unhampered by government intervention. Those involved in such transactions may be neighbors, citizens of the same country, or citizens of diffe rent countries. And in order for this exchange to occur, the benefits to each party must out- weigh the costs — or else the transaction won't take place. Another significant benefit to genuine free trade is that it minimizes the role played by government — that is, coercion — in society. When producers and consumers deal with each other in an honorable and mutually beneficial fashion, gov- ernment's role is merely that of ensuring that neither party de- frauds the other. In this way society is shaped by free choices made by individuals, rather than by the heavy-handed inter- vention of those who want to mold it, by force, in a fashion they deem appropriate. Simply put, free trade cannot co-exist with large, interven- tionist government — and the reverse of that statement is true as well. If the burden of regulation and taxation grows too onerous, one result will be the flight of capital abroad to less oppressive business environments. (Ironically, as we saw in the previous chapter, this is true of many American businesses setting up shop abroad: The burdens imposed by our gov- ernment on business are actually larger and heavier than those inflicted — for now, at least — in Communist China and oth-"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"38 America's Engineered Decline er countries.) One internationa l benefit of genuine free trade is its ability to undermine oppressive regimes, because — once again — such trade reduces coercion and expands personal choice. \"Upward Harmonization\" of Government Power All of this being said, how does the so-called North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the precursor to the FTAA, qualify as a \"free trade\" pact? To accomplish NAFTA's stated intention, a very brief document — perhaps no longer than a few pages — would be necessary. Yet the text of the basic NAFTA is spread across hundreds of pages and divided into two thick, heavy volumes. Much of the language contained therein establishes the foundati on for a large, cumbersome in- ternational regulatory bureaucracy. Furthermore, at several places the agreement anticipates the creation of additional \"an- nexes\" that would create even more layers of international bu- reaucracy. NAFTA's implementing legislation also included a provi- sion creating the North American Development Bank (NAD- Bank), a financial institution modeled on the UN-aligned World Bank. Another side agreement to NAFTA created the North American Financial Gro up (NAFG), which was intended to \"stabilize\" exchange rates among the three signatory countries. In practice, predictably, both NADBank and the NAFG have served as slush funds or piggy banks for politi- cally protected interests, particularly in Mexico. Rather than relieving the burden of regulation that impedes genuine free trade, NAFTA internationalized the regulatory apparatus — thereby making it less accountable to the U.S. citizens affected by those regulatory decisions. It is also in- tended to escalate, rather than reduce, the regulatory assault on commerce. This last fact was candidly ad mitted by former U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor as negotiations over NAFTA"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Amalgamating the Americas 39 side agreements ended in August 1993: \"No nation can lower labor or environmental standards, only raise them, and all states and provinces can enact even more stringent meas- ures....\" 3 The process described by Kantor is called \"upward harmonization\"; it is the creation of a socialist multi-national government on the installment plan. Although they are remote from, and not accountable to, the people of the United States, NAFTA's regulatory bodies are very responsive to pressures applied by non-governmental or- ganizations (NGOs). Chiefly composed of foundation-funded labor, environmental, human rights, and sundry radical \"ac- tivists,\" the NGO network is often referred to as \"international civil society.\" Their role is to supply \"pressure from below\" in support of initiatives handed down by the Power Elite, thereby providing an illusion of a broad \"consensus.\" 4 In the case of NAFTA and similar \"free trade\" agreements, the role played by NGOs is to demand \"upward harmonization\" of international regulations — even as the NGOs pose as opponents of the trade pacts. The Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI), one of numerous activist groups headed by veteran leftist Ralph Nader, offers a good example of this process at work. For decades, Nader, acting in the role of self-appointed \"consumer advocate,\" has agitated and litigated in pursuit of expanded regulation of the economy. He has done as much as any other private figure to create the massi ve regulatory burden that is driving businesses offshore. Now Nader and his comrades are using \"free trade\" pacts as a wa y of globalizing the same pros- perity-killing regulatory burdens. The October 1999 Congressional testimony of CSPI attor- ney Benjamin Cohen illustrates how this process works. \"Let me state at the outset that we support expansion of interna- tional trade.... We also recognize that international harmo- nization of food safe ty standards facilitat es trade.... The inter- national harmonization process will only benefit consumers if"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"40 America's Engineered Decline national regulatory standards are harmonized in an upward manner that provides the public with the greatest degree of protection from unsafe foods a nd deceptive trade practices.\" 5 Cohen and his comrades are e ngaging in a deceptive trade practice of their own — the cl assic \"bait-and-switch.\" But they're hardly alone in peddling international socialism dis- guised as free trade. Consider as well the case of the North American Commis- sion for Environmental Cooperation (NACEC), an advisory body growing out of the NAFTA pact with the role of enforcing multinational environmental standards. The minutes of a typical meeting of the commission's Joint Public Advisory Committee recorded th e presentation made by a representa- tive of an \"environmental NGO.\" The representative was com- plaining about \"downward harmonization\" of international eco-regulations and invoked Article 1114 of the NAFTA treaty to demand international collaboration in raising regulatory standards throughout the region. 6 NAFTA created literally scores of regulatory bodies, and left the door open for the creation of many more at whim. Prior to the agreement's enactment, tr ade analyst Thomas R. Edd-lem warned: Adoption of [NAFTA]... and its side agreements ... will create a lot of new high-paying jobs. Unfortunately, most of them will be government positions for bureaucrats working in the more than 30 new international government committees, subcommittees, councils, working groups, and subgroups mandated by NAFTA.... NAFTA itself would establish the Free Trade Council — a continental government-in-waiting with enormous discretionary powers — with at least eight permanent committees, six 'working groups,' and five subcommittees and subgroups. NAFTA's side agreement on import surges would add a permanent 'Working Group on"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Amalgamating the Americas 41 Emergency Actions,' and the side agreements on labor and the environment would create two additional regional law- making bodies, each with its own bureaucracy and advisory committees. 7 How does the creation of this huge — and growing — reg- ulatory leviathan aid the process of \"free trade\"? It doesn't, of course. Nor should it be expected to. It is, after all, the creation of the same ruling elite that has imposed enormous tax and regulatory burdens on American producers. With diabolical guile, that elite has enhanced its powers at considerable ex- pense to America's prosperity — while flying the false banner of \"free trade.\" \"Downward Harmonization\" of Living Standards \"Upward harmonization\" of government power inevitably pro- duces a corresponding phenomenon — \"downward harmo- nization\" of living standards, sometimes called the \"race to the bottom.\" As governing elites pool their power across borders, those they rule lose a corresponding amount of freedom and prosperity. On the tenth anniversary of the NAFTA accord, the Chris- tian Science Monitor noted that the agreement, \"while opening the doors for U.S. exports and helping Americans get low-cost consumer goods, has also sh aken entire industries from textiles to cars.\" 8 As our economy has been merged with so- cialist Canada and corrupt, cartelized Mexico, \"NAFTA has displaced American workers and devastated entire towns.... It's evident from the job-training centers in southern Texas to the 'NAFTA ghost towns' of North Carolina, with their shuttered textile plants.\" 9 Economist Jorge Gonzalez of San Antonio's Trinity Uni- versity claims that NAFTA has done \"exactly what it is sup- posed to do....

That helps the whole region become more com- petitive.\" 10 Economist Russell Roberts of George Mason Uni- versity agrees that the political benefits of integrating North America more than compensate for the hardships NAFTA has inflicted on American workers: \"The bottom line is this — NAFTA has caused hardship for some Americans in certain sectors, but it's made for a more stable and integrated Mexi- can political system — and that's a real good thing for the world.\" 11 Scant comfort such glib assessm ents will provide to Amer- icans whose lucrative manufacturing jobs have fled the coun- try. Breadwinners seeking to provide a decent standard of liv- ing for their families, and perh aps even leave an inheritance for their children, have little interest in regional \"competitive- ness,\" or in helping Mexico become \"stable and integrated.\" But they are the ones paying the price of the Power Elite's grand designs. And it's important to recognize that while American work- ers have endured hardships as a result of NAFTA, the ruling class is prospering as never before. Indeed, the Power Elite benefits directly by inducing \"downward harmonization\" on the working class. This is illustrated by the existence of the so- called \"Trade Adjustment Assistance\" program — a $1.3 bil- lion federal welfare program for Americans who lose their jobs as a result of NAFTA and other socialist \"free trade\" initia- tives. 12 Wherever it succeeds in reducing the proud, stubborn middle class to a state of welfare dependency, the political class prospers. Building World Government, Bloc by Bloc As we can clearly see, the expression \"free trade\" has been hi- jacked, tortured, and forced to serve purposes alien to its mean- ing. In this case, the banner of \"free trade\" has been wrapped deceptively around a mammoth campaign to abolish national sovereignty and build a socialist regional political bloc."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"44 America's Engineered Decline Here's how the deception works. Sovereign powers exer- cised by our nation, such as the power to protect our borders and Congress's constitutional role in regulating trade policy, are being depicted as impediments to trade. Removing those barriers, the public is told incessantly, will expand trade and thus increase our national prosperity. But the actual trade-off here involves the surrender of our sovereignty, on a piecemeal basis, to international regulatory bodies governing the various trade blocs. The so-called Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA), scheduled for completion in 2005, would expand on the \"progress\" made under NAFTA. As the FTAA secretariat ex- plains, the FTAA would \"unite the economies of the Americas into a single free trade area ... in which barriers to trade and investment will be progressively eliminated.\" 13 Once again, it's important to r ecognize that the \"barriers\" referred to in the statement above are actually the characteris- tics of national sovereignty. Removing them accelerates our descent from prosperity and independence into the pit of in- ternational socialism — and, eventually, world government. Enactment of NAFTA represente d a major step toward that end; this was attested by comments made in support of that agreement by globally minded luminaries. Former Secretary of State He nry Kissinger, a member of the executive committee of th e Trilateral Commission and a longtime power in the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) — the two most prominent and influential globalist organizations — stated in a 1993 Los Angeles Times op-ed column that NAF- TA \"will represent the most cr eative step toward a new world order taken by any group of countries since the end of the Cold War.... \"NAFTA \"is not a conventional trade agreement,\" he noted, \"but the architecture of a new international system.\" David Rockefeller, former CFR chairman and co-founder of the Trilateral Commission, went so far as to say in the Wall Street Journal that he didn't \"think that 'criminal' would be"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Amalgamating the Americas 45 too strong a word to describe ... rejecting NAFTA.\" Exhorted Rockefeller: \"Everything is in place — after 500 years - to build a true 'new world' in the Western Hemisphere.\" Andrew Reding of the New School for Social Research, a radical New York think-tank, described NAFTA as \"an incipient form of international government,\" that would \"signal the formation, however tentatively, of a new political unit — North Ameri- ca.\" 14 NAFTA, like the European Union (EU), is a political sub- sidiary of the World Trade Organization (WTO). As we will see in the next chapter, the WTO is the economic complement to the United Nations. Professor Nicole Anne Stubbs of the University of Washington observes: \"The EU and NAFTA both play by the same set of global trade rules set today by the World Trade Organization.... This represents a common thread between the two regional ins titutions.\" The chief difference between these two trade blocs is that \"The EU has deepened and widened while adhering to multilateral institutions such as the WTO.\" 15 The terms \"deepening\" and \"widening\" refer to the EU's territorial expansion and the growth of its socialist regulatory bureaucracy. Significantly, FTAA supporters admit that the proposed agreement represents a \"deepening\" and \"widening\" of NAFTA — the creation of an economic and political unit encompassing everything from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego, rul- ing the entire hemisphere as a subsidiary of the WTO. The American \"Soviet\" As Mexican President Vicente Fox frankly told an audience in Madrid, the objective is to create \"an ensemble of connections and institutions similar to those created by the European Union.\" The EU, significantly, has been described by former Soviet ruler Mikhail Gorbachev as a \"new European Soviet\" — that is, a socialist entity in which all economic, cultural, so- cial, and political questions will ultimately be decided by the"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"46 America's Engineered Decline central government in Brussels. Residents of the formerly independent nations of Europe are required to surrender thei r currencies, adopting in their place the euro — the value of wh ich will be set by a European central bank.

Residents of Great Britain could find themselves arre sted for offenses against EU laws, extradited, standing trial in front of foreign courts, and serving their sentences in foreign jails. The powers of local and national political bodies are being eclipsed by Brussels, placing questions of taxation, regulation, and even foreign pol- icy in the hands of the socialist Eurocrats. Similar conditions will prevail in this hemisphere if the FTAA comes into being, and the process of \"widening\" and \"deepening\" ensues. Eventually , Americans would find that they are powerless to affect decisions being made by remote international bureaucracies that affect their lives, livelihoods, and liberties. The value of our currency, the scope of regula- tory burdens on our businesses, the amount we pay in taxes — all of these decisions would be made by distant, unaccount- able bureaucrats whose job is to administer policies handed down from the WTO and the UN, rather than represent the in- terests of Americans. In this fashion — through patient, persistent incremental- ism, trading bloc by trading bloc — the architecture of a world government is taking shape around us. Although Utopian in de- sign, this campaign has real, tangible costs that are being felt in the loss of American jobs and the decline of our middle class as we are rudely and pitilessly \"harmonized\" down to the level of the less fortunate residents of this hemisphere."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"C HAPTER F OUR Caught in the WTO Web I am against GATT [General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, forerunner to the Worl d Trade Organization] because it is part and parcel of international socialism, one- worldism, and the slow surrender of American sov- ereignty....

The WTO tribunal ruled that Washington had failed to demonstrate — to the tribunal's satisfaction, at least — that the U.S. steel industry was genuinely threatened by a surge of imports of steel and related products. 3 Emboldened by the WTO's ruling, the European Union \"immediately warned President Bush that he must quickly withdraw the 20-month-old tariffs or face retaliation\" in the form of \"$2.2 billion in duties on U.S. goods.\" 22 nations that had jointly filed a WTO complaint against the tariffs — ini- tially set at 30 percent, but subsequently reduced — insisted that the Appellate Body's ruling \"leaves the United States with no other choice but to terminate its WTO-incompatible [tariff] measures without delay.\" 4 Incredibly, the assumption that the United States must com- ply with an arbitrary ruling handed down by a foreign body was not challenged by the White House. President Bush's press secretary maintained that the protective tariffs on steel \"were fully consistent with WTO rules.\" Republican Senator Charles Grassley, head of the Senate Finance Committee, advised Pres- ident Bush not to undermine the WTO's supposed authority: \"Complying with our WTO obligations is an important sign of American leadership.\" 5 This was not the first time that the WTO had ruled against the United States. Nor was it surprising that the body, in which the EU outvotes the U.S. 15 to 1, would hand down a decision favoring European interests. As we will see, from the begin- ning the WTO — like its pred ecessor, the abortive Interna- tional Trade Organization — was designed to put America at a disadvantage vis-a-vis the rest of the world.

In the case of the United States, the U.S. Con- gress — which under the U.S. Constitution has the exclusive power to regulate our trade with foreign nations — surrendered this critical legislative power to a globalist body composed of foreign bureaucrats with no interest in our nation's prosperity or sovereignty. Furthermore, where Republican globalists like Jack Kemp urged Congress to surrender sovereignty in the interest of a tax cut, the actual result was an American defeat on both accounts: Congress surrendered the power to regulate our nation's for- eign trade and handed to a globalist body the power to set tax policy. After all, tariffs are taxes — albeit of a much less in- vasive variety than the income tax. During the administration of Thomas Jefferson, the federal government's revenue came exclusively from the tariff. In his second Inaugural Address, President Jefferson boasted: The suppression of unnecessary offices ... enabled us to discontinue our internal taxes.... The remaining revenue on the consumption of foreign articles is paid chiefly by those who can afford to add foreign luxuries to domestic comforts, being collected on our seaboard and frontiers only, and, incorporated with the transactions of our mercantile citizens, it may be the pleasure and pride of an American to ask, \"What farmer, what"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"50 America's Engineered Decline mechanic, what laborer ever sees a taxgatherer of the United States?\" 6 It is hardly an exaggeration to say that defending American interests in international trade was one of the most important motives for creating a constitutional union out of the thirteen original colonies. And, of co urse, most Americans — even those only dimly aware of our heritage — recall the emphatic Revolutionary War slogan: \"No taxation without representa- tion!\" Yet Congress turned over vital powers over our policies on trade and taxes to a cabal of unelected, unaccountable for- eign social engineers — and it did so knowingly. Newt's Coup The November 1994 mid-term elections resulted in a Repub- lican majority for the first time since the early 1950s. Many — if not most — of the freshman representatives had been pro- pelled into Congress on the strength of the public's concerns over the growing expense and intrusiveness of government, as well as the accelerating loss of American sovereignty to inter- national organizations such as the UN. Following the election, incoming Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole and prospective Speaker of the House Newt Gin- grich agreed to an extraordinary \"lame duck\" session of the outgoing Congress. The purpose of that session was to approve U.S. membership in the WTO. Given the significance of that issue, why couldn't it await co nsideration by the incoming Congress, which was more clearly attuned to the public's con- cerns? And why would two \"conservative\" leaders be so de- termined to have this important issue determined by a Demo- crat-majority Congress? These questions effectively answer themselves.

I agree ... this is very close to Maastricht [the European Union treaty by which the EU member nations have sur- rendered their sovereignty], and twenty years from now we will look back on this as a very important defining moment. This is not just another trade agreement. This is adopting something which twice, once in the 1940s and once in the 1950s, the U.S. Congress rejected. I am not even saying we should reject it; I, in fact, lean toward it. But I think we have to be very careful, because it is a very big transfer of power. 7 Gingrich's admonition that Congress should be \"careful\" in handing power to the WTO was disingenuous, since he and Dole had arranged to conduct the lame duck session under \"fast-track\" rules. This meant that Congress had to vote the measure either up or down on an accelerated timetable: Under fast-track, debate is limited to twenty hours, and Senate fili- busters aren't permitted. So much for \"careful\" deliberation. Furthermore, as was the case with NAFTA, the GATT agreement creating the WTO was actually a treaty disguised as a trade agreement. By packaging the pact in this fashion, WTO proponents avoided the constitutional requirement that treaties win approval by a two-thirds super-majority in the Sen- ate. In the WTO, nations of the so-called \"Global South\" — for- merly known as the \"Third World,\" sometimes called, with un- due optimism, the \"developing world\" — possess 70 percent of the votes, and the U.S. has no veto power.

Shortly before Congress approved the WTO, former Treasury Department official Paul Craig Roberts ex- pressed amazement that \"anyone in Congress wants to pass a bill that gives the President sole power to negotiate remedies vvhen the WTO declares federal, state and local laws illegal under GATT. This power gives the White House a free hand to reward friends and to punish enemies.\" 8 At first glance this enhancement of presidential power seems to contradict the internationalist thrust of the WTO: Why would the measure empower both a cadre of unelected foreign bureaucrats and the U.S. president? Wouldn't the pres- ident be inclined to work on behalf of our national interests? Of course, Americans would expect this of their presidents. In practice, however, every pres ident since Franklin D.

It's worth noting that Sena tor Malone, a WWI veteran and"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"54 America's Engineered Decline military intelligence specialist, attended the UN's founding conference in San Francisco as an official observer for the Sen- ate Military Affairs Committee. He also toured — at his own expense — Europe, Asia, and the Middle East, primarily to in- vestigate the uses to which U.S. foreign aid was put. 10 A man of substantial academic achievement and considerable firsthand experience, Senator Malone could speak with authority about the developments he described — and their implications for our nation's future. Through a series of crucial decisions stealthily undertaken by what Malone called a \"combination\" within our govern- ment, \"a basic segment of the sovereign power of the people of the United States [was] removed from them and absorbed into the American executive.\" That power was then used to make a series of commitments in the name of our nation — \"the UNRRA [United Nations Relief and Relocation Agency]; Dumbarton Oaks [the secretive meeting to draft the UN Char- ter]; the Bretton Woods Conference which resulted in the In- ternational Bank and Fund; the Preparatory Conference for UNESCO [the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cul- tural Committee]; the San Fran cisco Conference which set up the United Nations; the NATO a nd SEATO military alliances; the Genocide Convention; the Declaration of Human Rights...\" The result of these decisions, concluded Senator Malone. was that \"our people have since been subjected to court inter- pretations which rest on 'the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.'\" 11 Once again, that is the \"political\" jaw of the pincers de- scribed by Senator Malone. Th e \"economic\" jaw was created by the Trade Agreements Act of 1934, in which Congress yielded to the president the power to control our nation's trade policy — thus allowing the executive branch to surrender that authority to foreign bureaucrats: \"That power is now being in- creasingly vested in international groups, and removed from"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Caught in the WTO Web 55 our Nation's control.\" 12 The most important of those groups, according to Senator Malone, was the GATT, which he iden- tified as \"an instrument of the growing International State.\" 13 Building the Socialist World State Malone warned that the ultimate purpose of the pincers move- ment was to create a \"Socialist World State\" in which our na- tion would lose its independence — and Americans would lose their prosperity and liberty. 14 This was the true purpose of the movement misleadingly labeled \"free world trade.\" Although that slogan promised freedom from state inter- ference in commerce, what it meant in practice was that \"the State would determine trade\" — each central government for individual nations, and ultimately a central global trade au- thority for the entire world. 15 With passage of the Trade Act of 1934, argued Senator Malone, \"the business and the enterprise of individuals now were considered in close connection to the policies of the state. The state would assist them in the expan- sion of their markets. Government would negotiate the chan- nels of trade....\" 16 Roughly a decade later, as war-weary nations were beguiled into supporting a global \"peacekeeping\" body called the United Nations, the world organization's architects proposed the creation of three economic bodies to supplement the UN: The International Trade Organization (ITO), the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. In late 1947, a delega- tion of U.S. internationalists attended a conference in Havana to finish the framework for the ITO. The Executive Committee Chairman of the U.S. delegation to the Havana Conference was the notorious Soviet agent and traitor Alger Hiss. 17 Along with Soviet official V.M. Molotov, Hiss had been the chief co-author of the UN Charter; he also served as secretary-general for the UN's founding conference. Hiss, an eager and capable enem y of our country, clearly re- garded the ITO as a means of hastening our nation's destruction."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"56 America's Engineered Decline As would be the case with the WTO, the ITO envisioned a one-nation, one-vote scheme that would leave America's trade policy in the hands of foreign rivals.

The final ITO draft was finished on March 24, 1948. But the pact's globalist and socialist provisions provoked opposi- tion from Congress and many of our nation's business associ- ations. The ITO \"was described as a charter to 'free world trade,'\" recalled Senator Malone. \"It was found to be a charter for trade control.... The result of its adoption would have been socialism, on a global plane.\" 19 \"The entire document reflects an excessive acceptance of economic planning,\" protested the U.S. Chamber of Com- merce. The National Foreign Trade Council warned that \"if the United States subscribes to the charter it will be abandon- ing traditional American principles and espousing, instead, planned economy and full-scale political control of produc- tion, trade, and monetary exchange. The charter does not re- flect faith in the principles of free, private, competitive enter- prise.\" 20 Because of widespread opposition to the agreement, the ITO was never submitted to Congress for ratification. But the internationalist Power Elite is never willing simply to take \"no\" for an answer, preferring to interpret that response as: \"Not yet — but someday soon.\" Just as they had done when the League of Nations failed, the Power Elite regrouped, changed the name of the defeated global body, and prevailed in the 1994 rematch — with the help of globalists in the Re- publican Party's leadership ranks."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Caught in the WTO Web 57 In Our Global Neighborhood, the UN-aligned Commission on Global Governance described the WTO's important role in \"global governance\" (that is, building world government): Particularly important is the establishment of a WTO to provide a stronger and more permanent successor to the GATT....

It is an open-ended process in which hordes of fo reign bureaucrats review state and local laws governing the licensing and certification of serv- ice workers — from beauticians to attorneys — and any other laws seen as impeding global free trade in services. Through that process, all state and local laws are thrown open to challenge by foreign governments. Under our constitutional system, all powers not explicitly granted to the central government are reserved to the states and the people. These \"numerous and indefinite\" powers, to use James Madison's phrase, include the power to establish li- censing guidelines for service industr ies, as well as regulations governing land use and ownership. It's true, of course, that thes e powers can be abused by local and state governments. But one assumption behind our con- stitutional system is that local and state governments would be more immediately accountable to the people and that, where those powers are abused, people would have the option of choosing to live elsewhere. Th e potential cost of losing pro- ductive populations would serve as a check on the regulatory ambitions of state governments. (Indeed, something of this sort happened to California during the 1990s, as business owners and taxpayers fled the over-t axed, over-regulated Golden State.) And under our Constitution, no state government can properly meddle in the regulatory affairs of other states — not that there would really be any incentive to do so: When one state imposes unreasonable regulatory burdens on business and industry, other states with more sensible policies benefit eco- nomically. Our federated constitutional government was the natural"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"Caught in the WTO Web 59 complement to a market-based economy, and this combina- tion led to unprecedented prosperity and technological progress. GATS is an effort to destroy America's economic system by forcing all states and local communities to conform to the edicts of a conclave of globalists in Geneva. Consider, for example, efforts by European Union GATS negotiators to force state governments to remove \"discrimina- tory\" laws regulating accounting, auditing, and bookkeeping services. Secret GATS negotiation documents leaked from Eu- rope record EU objections to laws of several states requiring in-state offices and residency requirements. The EU also de- manded removal of residency requirements for engineers, in- surance workers, and so forth. The EU also demanded removal of state laws requiring \"U.S. citizenship and residency for members of the board and incorporators\" of service-related businesses. 23 It's clear that GATS will eventu ally facilitate foreign chal- lenges to laws governing the licensing of attorneys, medical professionals, and other highly specialized \"service\" workers. As twenty-eight Democratic congressmen complained in a letter to the U.S. Trade Representative, \"the only services exempted [from the GATS process] would be those services 'supplied in the exercise of governmental authority,' defined as 'any service which is supplied neither on a commercial basis, nor in competition with one or more service providers.' These are critical terms that remain undefined and could be interpreted by a dispute panel in a way that renders the exemption mean- ingless.\" 24 It was the states that created our federal government and al- located it limited, revocable powers; after all, until the early 20th century, \"United States\" was understood to be a plural construction, as in \"these united States in Congress assem- bled....\" The process of consolidating the states into a mono- lith under the power of the central government began with the post-Civil War Reconstruction, gained momentum during"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"60 America's Engineered Decline World War I, accelerated radical ly during the New Deal, and has continued relentlessly ever since. The GATS process rep- resents the next logical step: Putting state governments under the control of a global central government. Once again, the rationale offered by proponents for this power grab is the necessity of removing impediments to \"free trade.\" Among these \"impediments\" are the powers reserved to the states for the specific pu rpose of protecting the people against the encroachments of the central government. The dis- tant, unaccountable bureaucrats seeking to absorb those powers certainly don't have our nation's best interests in mind. Exporting Jobs, Importing Workers Through the H-1B and L-1 visa programs, foreign non-immi- grant specialty workers are permitted to work in the United States. As noted in Chapter One, these programs have been used to train the workforces of foreign competitors, thereby fueling the outsourcing of technical jobs overseas. The 1995 GATS agr eement locked the Un ited States into an annual ceiling of 65,000 H-1B visas, and an unlimited num- ber of L-1 visas (which permit inter-company transfer of for- eign workers from abroad to the U.S.). Just as importantly, it inaugurated a process through which foreign interests can chal- lenge any limits on such temporary immigration as \"discrim- inatory\" — thereby forcing our nation to continue building a well-trained workforce that w ill benefit our economic com- petitors. Dan Stein of the Federation for American Immigra- tion Reform points out that under GATS, \"the United States bound itself by international agreement not to restrict either of these visa programs in the future, regardless of the state of the US economy or the level of unemployment of similarly qual- ified U.S. workers.\" 25 \"It is often difficult to tell these days if economies exist to serve the needs of people, or the other way around,\" continues Stein:"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"Caught in the WTO Web 61 Trade policies that include provisions for unfettered movement of people across international borders for the purpose of providing ever-cheaper labor lead us further down the path toward standing the relationship between people and economics on its head.

Bush's January 7, 2004 announcement of an ambitious plan to extend amnesty to millions — or tens of millions — of illegal immigrants triggered a sudden rush on our southern border. \"The U.S. Border Patrol marks January 7 as the day illegal crossing numbers surge,\" reported an Arizona Star dispatch from Hermosillo, a Mexican border town frequently used as a jumping-off point for illegal immigration. Mexicans arrive at the border by foot, bus, and train. Mexicana airlines and three other Mexican air carriers have thoughtfully arranged special flights that carry hundreds of border-jumpers to Hermosillo each day. Once there, those seek ing to enter the U.S. illegally often place themselves in the care of immigrant smugglers, known as coyotes. Hundreds die each year as they try to make the dangerous desert crossing into Arizona in search of work. 4 A similar \"amnesty rush\" ensu ed across the southwestern border. At the San Ysidro port of entry — the world's largest land-based border crossing — Border Patrol officials noted a sharp increase in the use of fraudulent identification papers in the immediate aftermath of President Bush's announcement. More than half of those caught with counterfeit documents ad- mitted that the amnesty offer induced them to attempt to enter the U.S. illegally. Not surprisingly, active and former Border Patrol agents were less than enamored of the Bush amnesty proposal. \"Everybody thinks it's a slap in the face,\" commented San Diego-based agent T.J. Bonner, head of the 10,000-member Border Patrol Council. The council's vice president, John Frecker, concurred in that view, noting further in a letter to Border Patrol agents that the amnesty proposal \"implies that the country really wasn't serious about [immigration control] in the first place, in spite of what you were told about the 'big P"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"Electing a New People 65 picture.'\" 5 Agents of the U.S. Border Patrol carry out a vital and unique role by literally guarding our nation's frontiers against foreign invasion. In the line of duty the men who compose the \"Thin Green Line\" of the Border Patrol face hardship, danger, and occasionally death at the hands of drug and alien smug- glers. Agents are often called on to provide medical care to people cruelly abandoned to their fate by the venal, corrupt coyotes. The Border Patrol's work is difficult and largely thankless even at the best of times. An amnesty for illegal aliens makes that job almost impossible. \"In 1986, we had the first amnesty, it was supposed to be a one-shot deal,\" pointed out retired Border Patrol Agent Mike Cutler. At the time, the illegal alien population was estimated at roughly 3-6 million. By 2004, it had increased to at least 8-12 million. 6 This reflects the unfortunate reality that crime unpunished is crime rewarded. The 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) offered what was supposed to be a limited amnesty, coupled with a reinvigorated effort to enforce immi- gration laws. But IRCA actually created a huge influx of unas- similated migrants as newly \"legalized\" aliens began to import their relatives through the process of \"chain immigration.\" At the same time, the measure's amnesty provision sent a clear signal that our government has no credible interest in enforcing our nation's immigration laws. Thus the number of illegal aliens grew unchecked — and the 1986 IRCA amnesty eventually begat the 2004 Bush amnesty. And even as they gird ed up to deal with the conse- quences of the latest \"amnesty rush,\" Border Patrol agents were ordered not to discuss developments that would reflect negatively on the Bush plan. A memo sent by the Customs and Border Protection headquarters in Washington ordered agents: \"Do not speculate about the program. Do not provide statis- tics on apprehension spikes or past amnesty data.\" 7 "},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"66 America's Engineered Decline With apologies to Tennyson, these agents were told, in ef- fect: Theirs was not to question why; theirs was but to watch our nation die. Borders, after all, are indispensable to defining national identity, as are enforceable laws, a shared language, and a common public culture. The Bush amnesty was a direct assault on all of these indispensable traits of an independent nation. Come One, Come All Perhaps the most remarkable thing about the Bush amnesty plan was the president's insist ence that it wasn't amnesty at all. \"This plan is not amnesty, placing undocumented workers on the automatic path of citizenship,\" insisted President Bush during a press conference with Mexican President Vicente Fox. \"I oppose amnesty because it en courages the violation of our laws and perpetuates illegal immigration.\" 8 But the unavoidable reality of the Bush proposal is that it would reward those who broke our immigration laws: They would be allowed to jump the queue and obtain legal status ahead of millions of people who followed our laws, many of whom spend years in their quest for citizenship. Described as a \"guest-worker\" plan, the Bush amnesty pro- posal included: • \"legal status, as temporary workers, [for] the millions of undocumented men and women now employed in the United States, and to those in foreign countries who seek to participate in the program and have been offered em- ployment here\"; • a three-year, renewable grant of legal status; • an increase in the an nual allotment of \"green cards that can lead to citizenship\" for il legal aliens, and an increase in the limit on legal immigration, which President Bush insisted was \"too low.\" 9 In announcing his proposal, President Bush was flanked by representatives of Hispanic lobbying groups, including the rad-"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"Electing a New People 67 ical League of United Latin Am erican Citizens. He also re- ferred to Tony Garza, the administration's ambassador to Mex- ico, as \"El Embajador of Mexico\" — a bizarre and puzzling way to refer to an official who supposedly represents our na- tion's interests abroad. But the entire thrust of Mr. Bush's announcement was that America has an obligation to provide economic help to for- eigners — including those who violate our nation's laws. \"[Im- migration reform] must begin by confronting a basic fact of life and economics: some of the jobs being generated in Amer- ica's growing economy are jobs American citizens are not fill- ing,\" he intoned. \"Out of common sense and fairness, our laws should allow workers to enter our country and fill jobs that Americans ... are not filling.... If an American employer is of- fering a job that American citizen s are not willing to take, we ought to welcome into our country a person who will fill that job.\" The entire purpose of our immigration system, he con- cluded, should be to \"match willing foreign workers with willing American employers, when no Americans can be found to fill the jobs.\" 10 In reality, there are few jobs that can't attract American em- ployees — if the price (the offered wage) is suitable. Throwing open the American labor market to hordes of desperate im- migrants from Mexico, Central America, the Middle East, and Asia will artificially depress wages. The result will be either a huge influx of low-wage foreign labor, a radical decline of living standards on the part of Americans willing to work for Third World wages — or both. \"It's all a matter of supply and demand,\" points out Steve Sailer, president of the Human Bio diversity Institute. \"As they teach you during the first week of Econ 101, when the supply of labor goes up its price [wage] goes down.... The only re- striction the Bush people are talking about is that the job of- fers to foreigners must meet the minimum wage. That's $5.15 per hour, or $10,712 for a full-time worker.\""},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"68 America's Engineered Decline Members of the opinion-molding class are largely indiffer- ent to these realities, Sailer notes. \"Massive immigration is vastly more popular among the elites than among the public. Lawyers, politicians, and business executives won't find their pay driven down much by increased competition. On the other hand, if I was, say, a carpenter, I'd be horrified by what the President of the United States is planning to do to me and my family. What's the global average wage made by carpenters? I'd be surprised if it were more than 33 percent of the average American carpenter's wage, and I wouldn't be shocked if it were only 10 percent as much.\" 11 Thus in addition to legalizing a huge pool of illegal immi- grants and setting the stage for another round of \"chain immi- gration,\" the Bush amnesty proposal would amount to a global job fair, with the American labor market thrown open to low- wage workers from every nation. With high-tech and manufacturing jobs fleeing the U.S.A., and millions of low-skilled workers flooding in, what will America look like a decade from now? Homeland Insecurity Sailer described the Bush amnesty plan as \"a globalist liber- tarian's fantasy. It's essentially identical to the Wall Street Jour- nal editorial page's long campaign for a constitutional amend- ment reading 'There shall be open borders.'\" Curiously, however, the Bush administration, and the glob- alist elites it serves, are concerned about preserving some na- tional borders. Just not our own. Two years after the devastating 9-11 terrorist assault on our nation, our nation's borders remained terrifyingly insecure, and our wounded economy continued to shed manufacturing jobs.

Hundreds of millions of dollars were to be spent on \"private sector business initiatives and jobs train- ing programs:\" 2 Why American taxpayers, drowning in debt, ravaged by in- flation, and anxious over their own employment prospects, should pay to train Iraqi workers, the Bush administration didn't deign to explain. More than two million dollars was requested by Iraq's colo- nial administration \"to fund public safety including police [and] border enforcement.\" 13 The Iraqi Provisional Authority pleaded for $150 million to train new Iraqi border control and customs officials, as well as to refurbish scores of border out- posts. \"Without this investment,\" insisted the authority's request, \"the nation will continue to be at tremendous risk of penetra- tion by members of terrorist cells and other subversive organ- izations; smuggling will continue to bleed the revenues nec- essary for the Iraqi economy to stand on its own and Iraq will not be able to control its borders.\" 14 In keeping with its globalist perspective, the Wall Street Journal — one of the key tone-setting organs of the \"conser- vative\" media — editorially endorsed the Bush administra- tion's skewed priorities. Applauding the amnesty proposal, the Journal denounced the \"nativist Right\" for calling for drastic measures, including, if necessary, the deployment of our mil- itary to guard the southern border — \"as if an already stretched Army doesn't have enough missions.

One beneficiary of the 1986 IRCA amnesty was terrorist \"sleeper\" agent Mahmoud Abouhalima, the ringleader of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. Co-conspirator Mo- hammed Salameh also applied for amnesty but was turned down — yet, perhaps in part b ecause of the bureaucratic bur- den created by the amnesty, he was still able to remain in the country for seven years. In anticipation of its amnesty plan, the Bush administration pressured financial institutions and municipal governments to accept Mexico's matricula consular cards as legitimate iden- tification, despite the fact that they are issued to Mexican im- migrants irrespective of their legal status. 16 Just weeks before President Bush announced his amnesty plan, Imelda Ortiz Abdala, a former Mexican consul in Lebanon, was arrested and charged with running an immi- grant-smuggling ring into the U.S. Between 1998 and 2001, Ortiz — aided by Mexican citizen Salim Boughader, a native of Lebanon — smuggled numerous individuals into the U.S.. including at least one identified as a \"Muslim extremist.\" Ortiz's role in this scheme, allegedly, was to provide fraud- ulent Mexican passports (at up to $4,500 a copy) to Boughad- er's clients. Between 1999 and his arrest in November 2002, Boughader reportedly smuggled about 300 illegal immigrants from Lebanon into the U.S. Convicted of human trafficking last March, Boughader was released and deported to Mexico after serving 10 months. Arrested again in Mexico, Boughader now faces up to 30 years in prison on organized crime-related charges. 17 Ironically, Boughader served time in a U.S. prison — and"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"Electing a New People 71 faces a lengthy prison term in Mexico — for committing ex- actly the offenses that would be legalized by the Bush amnesty plan. And the illegal immigrant ring he created with the help of a Mexican diplomat offered a telling illustration of the po- tentially deadly consequences of undermining our borders. Why Borders Matter Even if our nation didn't face a grave threat from foreign ter- rorism, controlling immigration would be vital to the preser- vation of our free institutions. In his report on immigration to the First Congress, James Madison urged that America \"welcome every person of good fame [who] really means to inco rporate himself into our soci- ety, but repel all who will not be a real addition to the wealth and strength of the United States.\" To reasonable people, Madi- son was only stating the obvious: America's immigration poli- cies should serve the interests of our nation while preserving its prosperity, independence, fr ee institutions, and distinctive civic culture. Given that our nation's political system, economy, and cul- tural institutions are outgrowths of Anglo-European traditions, it's not surprising that for roughly the first 200 years of our na- tional existence American immigration policies traditionally favored English-speaking immigrants from Europe who could adapt themselves to our institutions. Ironic as it may seem to those of the statist persuasion, the absence of a welfare \"safety net\" was another source of social cohesion during the \"great wave\" of immigration that occurred between 1890 and 1920. Immigration researcher Peter Brimelow estimates, \"At the turn of the century, 40 percent of all immigrants went home, basica lly because they failed in the work force.\" Millions of others, often with the help of extended families, religious institutions, and fraternal organizations, found a secure foothold in our nation. They learned our com- mon language, adopted our public culture, and succeeded in"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"72 America's Engineered Decline America's economy. Many of them, particularly those who had fled poverty, oppression, and persecution, went on to become exceptionally idealistic citizens. 18 This isn't to say, however, that the absence of a welfare state allowed the luxury of open borders. The immigration acts of 1921 and 1924, passed largely in reaction to the social pres- sures accompanying the \"great wave,\" were sought to preserve a stable status quo by imposing a national origins quota sys- tem. The McCarran-Walter Act of 1952 retained the basic structure of the 1924 measure, enhanced with provisions in- tended to deny admission to known subversives. 19 The Immigration Reform Act (IRA) of 1965 completely in- verted our nation's border policies by assuming that they should serve the interests of the world, rather than of our na- tion. Senator Robert F. Kenne dy (D-N.Y.) put this proposition quite plainly during debate over the measure, insisting that \"the relevant community is not merely the nation, but all men of goodwill.\" 20 IRA was deliberately designed to increase immigration from non-Western nations; this was accomplished by abolish- ing the national origins quota system. Although the formal immigration quota was raised only slightly, the measure al- lowed for theoretically unlimited \"non-quota\" immigration for refugees, asylum seekers, and re latives of naturalized citizens for purposes of \"family reunification\" (by a process known as \"chain immigration\"). For IRA's critics, the measure's consequences — a flood tide of unassimilable immigrants and resulting social turmoil — were entirely predictable. Senator Edward Kennedy (D- Mass.), who served as Senate floor manager for the Senate ver- sion of IRA, tried to defuse those objections by offering sooth- ing assurances of what the bill supposedly would not do: First, our cities will not be flooded with a million im- migrants annually.

In the final analysis, the ethnic pattern of immigration under the proposed measure is not expected to change as sharply as the critics seem to think. 21 Not surprisingly, Peter Brimelow observes, \"Every one of Senator Kennedy's assurances ha s proven false. Immigration levels did surge upward. They are now [during the mid-1990s] running at around a million a year, not counting illegals. Im- migrants do come predominantly from one area — some 85 percent of the 16.7 million legal immigrants arriving in the United States between 1968 and 1993 came from the Third World: 47 percent from Latin America and the Caribbean; 34 percent from Asia.... Also, immigrants did come dispropor- tionately from one country — 20 percent from Mexico.\" 22 In addition to the millions of ille gal aliens who flood our shores annually, America takes in more legal immigrants than the rest of the industrial world combined. Counter-Assimilation It is conceivable that American society could handle even an influx of this magnitude, if it weren't for the counter-assimila- tionist roles played by the welfare state and the huge racial en- titlements industry. Liberal commentator Michael Lind, who does not reject the welfare/affirmative action state in principle, points out: \"As a proportion of the U.S. population, the groups eligible for racial preference benefits are rapidly growing, thanks to mass immigration from Latin America and Asia.\" While earlier European immigrants were under the necessity of assimilating quickly, Lind observes that \"today's His-"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"74 America's Engineered Decline panic and Asian immigrants are tempted by a variety of re- wards for retaining their distinctive racial identities, even their different languages\": The moment a Mexican or Chinese immigrant becomes a naturalized citizen of the Un ited States, he can qualify for special consideration in admission to colleges and universities, at the expense of better-qualified white Americans; expect and receiv e special treatment in em- ployment; apply for minority business subsidies denied to his neighbors; and even demand to have congressional district lines redrawn to maximize the likelihood of electing someone of his race or ethnic group.... 23 Building constituencies of de pendents is a major industry for any welfare state, particular ly if the dependents in ques- tion are effectively confined to a cultural and linguistic ghetto. Yes, most immigrants — including those who come here illegally — are inclined to work. Many of them, particularly those from Mexico, work very hard. 24 But where earlier gen- erations of immigrants had to provide for themselves — thereby learning to adapt to our country and society — the present welfare system creates perverse incentives for separatism, at considerable expense to the taxpayer. In a 1993 study, economist Donald Huddle of Rice Uni- versity documented that \"immig rants cost the American tax- payer more than $42.5 billion in 1992 alone\" for services such as subsidized education, Medicaid, health and welfare services, bilingual education, and other benefits. The cost of welfare subsidies to immigrants between 1993 and 2002, Huddle es- timated, would average \"$67 billion per year in 1992 dollars, a net total of $668.5 billion after taxes over the decade.\" 25 \"Mexifornia\" California absorbs roughly 40 percent of America's immi-"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"Electing a New People 75 grants — a fact that contributed significantly to the state's in- solvency and recent gubernatorial recall. Although California's immigrants come from Europe, Asia, the former Soviet Union, the Caribbean, and various Latin American nations, simple ge- ography dictates that the largest percentage — especially those who come illegally — arrive from Mexico. \"Most arrivals are given work by grateful employers,\" notes Victor Davis Hanson, a professor of classics and farmer who lives in northern California. \"Alt hough illegal aliens are eager to get a fighting chance to succeed in America, many are not prepped for, nor immersed into, the cutthroat competitive cul- ture they help to mobilize. In stead, in recent years they and their offspring have ended up in ethnic enclaves of the mind and barrios of the flesh. In these locations they often soon be- come dependent on subsidies — and too many of their chil- dren will join an underclass to be led by ethnic shepherds who often do more harm than good....\" 26 Counter-assimilationist pressures abound in California. Many of Hanson's most outstanding students are Americans of Mexican ancestry.

Meanwhile, however, such cash payments force other Americans and legal immigrants to pay steeper taxes in part to cover those who pay none. So the farmer cheering over access to solid, dependable, cheap labor is now learning that he pays more than he thinks for illegal aliens in the form of rising taxes as well as a fraying social fabric.\" 29 Not only are law-abiding Californians forced to subsidize law-breakers, they are also to uched up to create a multi-gen- erational indigent class. At age 50, notes Brimelow, \"the illegal worker is physically worn out and unemployable. His American-born children are alienated high-school dropouts.

In 2001, the Mexican government conducted an ambitious program called \"Plan Sur,\" intended to seal off Mexico's 600- mile frontier with Guatemala and Belize, as well as the Isth- mus of Tehuantepec. In 2000 and 2001, Mexico deported more than a quarter-million illegal immigrants from Central and South America. According to Fe lipe de Jesus Preciado, head of the Mexican migration service, \"the flow of Central Amer- ican migrants north is a national security problem for Mexico.

Communist China is more powerful, North Korea is better-armed, and \"post-Soviet\" Russia remains deeply involved in fomenting subversion and terrorism world-wide. But apart from Mexico, no other foreign power is actively carrying out a plan to occupy and \"re-conquer\" U.S. territory.

And the Mexican ruling elite exploits every opportunity to cul- tivate public hostility toward the United States. \"Mexican newspaper readers and television viewers are re- galed constantly with descripti ons of the ill-treatment of Mex- icans in the United States,\" obse rves Alan Wall, an American citizen who works as a teacher in Mexico. \"America's attempts to control its own borders are presented as 'racist,' 'xenopho- bic,' and 'anti-Mexican.' The United States is blamed for deaths of illegal aliens who die crossing the border in the desert, and Mexican politicians have called the border a 'slaughterhouse' and a 'modern Nazi zone.'\" 35 \"In Mexico, all political partie s support increased Mexican emigration to the United States, amnesty [for illegal aliens], and government benefits for Mexicans in the United States,\" Wall continues. \"In fact, very few influential Mexicans pub- licly acknowledge the right of the U.S. to control her own bor- ders.

In an article published more than two decades ago in Ex- celsior, the Mexican analogue to the New York Times, colum- nist Carlos Loret de Mola described the outpouring of Mexican immigrants into the United Stat es as \"The Great Invasion\": A peaceful mass of people ... carries out slowly and pa- tiently an unstoppable invasion, the most important in human history. You cannot give me a similar example of such a large migratory wave by an ant-like multitude, stubborn, unarmed, and carried on in the face of the most powerful and best-armed nation on earth.... [Neither] barbed-wire fences, nor aggressive border guards, nor campaigns, nor laws, nor police raids against the un- documented, have stopped this movement of the masses that is unprecedented in any part of the world. 37 According to Loret, the migrant invasion \"seems to be slowly returning [the southwestern United States] to the jurisdiction of Mexico without the firing of a single shot, nor requiring the least diplomatic action, by means of a steady, spontaneous, and uninterrupted occupation.\" The notion that those U.S. territories are \"returning to the jurisdiction of Mexico\" is an allusion to the concept that Cal- ifornia, Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, and Texas, the states created in the territory obtain ed from Mexico through the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848, compose \"Aztlan,\" the mythical homeland of the Aztec Indian.

Headed by an official who has dual citizenship in the U.S. and Mexico, the council's purpose, according to Fox, was to act as a liaison between the Mexican President and the \"23 million Mexicans in th e U.S.\" That number includes American citizens of Mexican ancestry. 41 Mexico uses its 48 consulates on U.S. soil to meddle in our domestic politics and mobilize Mexican-Americans on behalf of a foreign government. In 1994, Mexico's consulate in Los Angeles helped organize resistance to Proposition 187, a bal- lot measure seeking to deny non-emergency welfare benefits to illegal aliens. In Houston, the Mexican consul — along with officials from the U.S. Department of Labor, the Equal Em- ployment Opportunity Commission, and the radical group MALDEF — participated in a consortium to educate and ad- vise immigrants who consider themselves victims of discrim- ination in matters of immigration, employment, or wages.

Illegal immigration has distorted the elec- toral map by re-distributing seats in the House of Representa- tives. Apportionment of congressional seats is based on census figures, which include (sometimes through the use of dubious \"statistical sampling\" methods) illegal immigrants. The results from the 2000 census caused Indiana, Michigan, and Missis- sippi to lose a congressional seat; Montana, which has long had a single seat, failed to acquire a second one, as had been expected; Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Kentucky, and Utah also had one fewer congre ssional seat than they would have were it not for the presence of \"non-citizens.\" California, New York, Florida, and Texas — each of which has a large and Electing a New People 81"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"82 America's Engineered Decline growing population of unassimilated alien migrants — all gained congressional seats. 43 This immigration-induced redistribution of political influ- ence \"takes away representation from states composed almost entirely of U.S. citizens and results in the creation of new dis- tricts in states with large numbers of non-citizens,\" comments the Center for Immigration Reform. \"In the nine states that lost a seat due to the presence of non-citizens, only one in 50 res- idents is a non-citizen. In contra st, one in seven residents is a non-citizen in California, which picked up six [of the reas- signed seats]. One in 10 resident s is a non-citizen in New York, Texas, and Florida....\" 44 In California's 31st congressional district, 43 percent of all residents are non-citizens. Nationwide, roughly 40 percent of all Hispanics are non-c itizens. As commentator John J. Miller observes, packing them into congressional districts threatens to re-create the notorious \"rotten boroughs\" of 18th century England, in which only a handful of people were eligible to vote. \"Non-citizen apportionm ent has delivered something very much like this to our own shores, though we might call them 'rotten barrios,'\" states Miller. 45 Thanks in some measure to the influence of \"rotten bar- rios,\" the electoral landscape for presidential politics will be altered, since votes in the El ectoral College are based on the size of congressional delegations. During the run-up to the 1996 presidential elections, the Clinton administration took a more direct approach to altering the landscape by hurriedly naturalizing more than one million immigrants in politically critical states. Through the \"Citizenship USA\" program, administered by Vice President Al Gore, hundreds of thousands of applicants for naturalization were rushed through the naturalization process \"in disregard of normal procedures and legal stan- dards, such as criminal backgr ound checks,\" recalls former Congressman Bob Barr. This \"allowed a flood of immigrants"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"Electing a New People 83 to gain citizenship without meeting the standard INS proce- dures.\" Nearly 180,000 immigr ants, including an estimated 11,000 with prior felony arrests, were made citizens without undergoing required FBI background checks. An INS depor- tation officer who had left the Citizenship USA program in disgust complained to the Chicago Tribune: \"They are not stopping people the way we used to. The big initiative is to get all these people eligible to vote and registered. It's just a rush for numbers.\" 46 This cynical effort to undermine our national identity in search of political advantage brings to mind Berthold Brecht's sarcastic reaction to East Ge rmany's 1953 crackdown on la- bor unrest: \"If the government doesn't like the people, why doesn't it dissolve them and elect a new people?\" Obviously, the immediate political beneficiaries of unchecked immigra- tion are the architects and custodian s of the welfare state. But it shouldn't be thought that liberal Democrats are alone in their enthusiasm for open borders. Merging with Mexico \"Whatever else George W. Bush does, or doesn't do,\" com- mented Newsweek political analyst Howard Fineman in late 2001, \"he has earned a place in hi story as the first American president to place Hispanic voter s at the center of politics, and the first to view the land between Canada and Guatemala as one. It makes sense, if you think about it: Texas, long ago and far away, was part of Mexico. Now a Texan is trying to re- assemble the Old Country, and then some.\" 47 Fineman's history is rather faulty. Texas was \"part of Mex- ico\" in the same sense that the Thirteen American Colonies were \"part\" of England. Like the American Colonists, the 'Texicans\" fought a war of independence that grew out of an effort to vindicate their constitutional rights (in their case, rights promised under Mexico's 1824 constitution). Texas wasn't part of the \"Old Country\" when it was admitted to the"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"84 America's Engineered Decline Union, but rather an independent republic. But Fineman was absolutely right in saying that the policy promoted by the Bush administration was to amalgamate the entire hemisphere. During the August 2001 state visit of Vicente Fox to the United States, President Bush convened a meeting of the U.S.- Mexico Binational Commission, a cabinet-level body in which officials from both national governments develop joint poli- cies on such issues as immigration, counter-narcotics efforts, trade, energy, and foreign policy. 48 In 1993, under the NAFTA framework, the U.S. and Mexico established the Border Environment Cooperation Commission and the North Ameri- can Development Bank (NADBank). Although the NADBank was origin ally designed to finance environmental initiatives at the border, the Fox administration demanded to use the bank to subsidize projects \"in non-envi- ronmental sectors and in a wider geographic zone,\" to use the delicate language of a White House press release. In an inter- view published in the September 4, 2001 Washington Post, Fox claimed that using the NADBank to subsidize economic de- velopment in Mexico is justified by the \"broad spirit of coop- eration, as well as justice and equity.\" This is to say that Mex- ico sees NADBank as a U.S. taxpayer-subsidized pinata. But this isn't all. During Fox's visit the Atlanta Journal- Constitution noted that Fox \"envisions a North American eco- nomic alliance that will make the border between the United States and Mexico as unrestricted as the one between Ten- nessee and Georgia.\" 49 Of course, Tennessee and Georgia are not separate, independent countries, but states in the same con- stitutional union. This implies that the United States and Mex- ico, as well as Canada, would cede their sovereignty to a new. supra-national political union — a prospect warmly endorsed by the Journal-Constitution. \"The ultimate goal of any White House policy ought to be a North American economic and political alliance similar in scope and ambition to the European Union,\" opined a Jour-"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"Electing a New People 85 nal-Constitution house editorial for September 7th. \"Unlike the varied landscapes and cultu res of European Union mem- bers, the United States, Canada and Mexico already share a great deal in common, and language is not as great a barrier. President Bush, for example, is quite comfortable with the blended Mexican-Anglo culture forged in the border states of Texas, California and Arizona.\" 50 \"Fundamentally, economic integration with Mexico is in- evitable,\" insists Jagdish Sheth of Emory University. Speaking of U.S.-Mexico convergence, Georgia State University economist David Sjoquist declares: \"Our choice is to fight it and lose, or embrace it and come out better for it.\" 51 Essentially, this is the \"argument from inevitability,\" a tactic preferred by rapists seeking to minimize their victims' re- sistance: \"It's going to happen anyway, so you might as well hold still and enjoy it.\" President Bush preferred to dress up that argument with a layer of humanitarian gloss: \"There are people in Mexico who've got children, who worry about where they're going to get their next meal from,\" asserted the presi- dent. \"And they're going to come to the United States.... That's a simple fact. And we've got to respect that....\" 52 But as noted above, the hardship of ordinary Mexicans is largely the result of that nation's embedded criminal ruling elite, which uses emigration to the U.S. as a means of fore- stalling desperately needed reforms. That elite has been sup- ported for decades by U.S. foreign policy and foreign aid. If the intent is to make life better for Mexico's long-suffering people, turning the U.S. into a combination public works proj- ect/welfare hostel for Mexicans won't work. It will, however, succeed in \"harmonizing\" Amer ica down to Mexico's eco- nomic level. During their 2001 summit, presidents Bush and Fox laid the groundwork for the so-called \"Partnership for Prosperity\" (PfP) — an initiative designed to use American tax dollars to build Mexico's manufacturing sector. Like most international"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"86 America's Engineered Decline socialist undertakings of this sort, the PfP was formally inau- gurated at a UN global conference — specifically, the March 2002 UN foreign aid conference in Monterrey, Mexico. Ac- cording to the U.S. State Depa rtment, PfP's action plan calls for U.S. assistance in Mexico to boost investment in housing and commercial infrastructure to boost Mexican productivity. A key outgrowth of the PfP was a bilateral agreement signed in June of 2002 to permit the Overseas Private Invest- ment Corporation (OPIC) \"to offer all its programs and serv- ices in Mexico....\" OPIC was established by Congress to help U.S. companies invest overseas by granting direct loans or loan guarantees for investments and extending insurance to cover the risks of investment. CEO Peter S. Watson boasted that the bilateral agreement with Mexico \"will help to further unleash the entrepreneurial capacity of Mexican businesses by mobi- lizing U.S. capital, and consequently bring important devel- opmental benefits to the Mexican people.... [It] will also allow OPIC to work freely along with its sister agencies, the US Trade and Development Agency and the Export Import Bank of the US, in providing investment support in Mexico....\" 53 In brief, OPIC and its sister agencies are using taxpayer money, and the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, to promote the relocation of manufacturing jobs from the U.S. to Mexico — even as Washington keeps both our borders and the welfare spigots open to invaders from the south. \"The Whole Enchilada, or Nothing\" Within the framework for the PfP, presidents Bush and Fox pledged that they would \"strive to consolidate a North Amer- ican economic community whose benefits reach the lesser-de- veloped areas of the region and extend to the most vulnerable social groups in our countries.\" 54 Within a few months of that declaration, the Mexican gov- ernment had composed a five-point program to hasten \"con- solidation\" with the U.S.:"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"Electing a New People 87 • Legalization of \"undocumented\" workers (that is, illegal aliens from Mexico); • An expanded permanent visas program; • An enhanced guest-worker visas program; • Border control cooperation; • Economic development in immigrant-sending regions of Mexico. This list of demands, according to Mexican foreign minis- ter Jorge Castaneda, was essentially non-negotiable: He in- sisted that the U.S. had to accept \"the whole enchilada, or noth- ing.\" 55 The problem, of course, is that there was nothing for the U.S. on that list, apart from empty assurances of \"border con- trol cooperation\" from Mexico City. In exchange for that use- less promise, the U.S. was expect ed to grant amnesty to illegal immigrants, take on a new wave of legal resident aliens, and lavish economic aid on Mexico. Incredible as it may seem, the Bush administration was on board. Through the PfP, taxpayers in our country were being shaken down to underwrite economic development south of the border. Amnesty for illegal aliens was all but a done deal. Then came 9/11. For more than a year after Black Tuesday, the amnesty proposal rested on the proverbial back burner. But in July 2003, three Republican members of Arizona's con- gressional delegation — Senator John McCain, and Con- gressmen Jim Kolbe and Jeff Flake — took up the proposal anew by introducing \"guest-worker\" bills intended to legalize illegal immigrants currently em ployed in the U.S. The envi- sioned guest-worker program would essentially allow the en- tire illegal alien population in this country to apply for per- manent legal residency (provided that the applicant had an em- ployer or family sponsor). There would also be no limit to the number of \"guest workers\" admitted annually. In short, the measure was designed to reward those who vi- olated our nation's immigration laws, while effectively de-"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"88 America's Engineered Decline molishing any remaining limit on legal immigration. President Bush, head of an administration so concerned about the secu- rity of Iraq's borders, reportedly told Senator McCain and Reps. Kolbe and Flake that he was \"enthusiastic\" about the guest worker program, and that enactment of the program would be a \"high priority.\" 56 To complement the amnesty proposal \"from above,\" the radical left organized a nationwide protest intended to demon- strate pressure \"from below.\" Dubbed the \"Immigrant Workers Freedom Ride,\" the Fall 2003 campaign was \"reminiscent of the civil rights struggles of the 1960s,\" claimed the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. The protest attracted busloads of \"rid- ers\" — most of them from Mexico, Central America, and Colombia — who converged on Washington, D.C., before heading to a final rally in New York City. A delegation from the event paid a visit to Atlanta to lay a wreath at the grave of Martin Luther King Jr., thereby symbolically claiming the slain activist's mantle. \"The campaign is calling for immigration reform that will open a path for legalization for immigrants already here, per- mit their families in foreign countries to join them, and pro- tect the rights of workers, regardless of their legal status,\" re- ported the paper. \"The campaign is supported by a coalition of labor unions, religious groups and civil rights activists.\" 57 Arguably the most critical omission in the Journal-Consti- tution story had to do with the role of the Communist Party and other subversive groups in organizing the \"Immigrant Workers Freedom Ride\": The event's website conspicuously listed the Communist Party, U.S.A. among its sponsors and provided a link to the party's website. 58 It's impossible to be- lieve that the paper, or any similar mainstream media organ, would decline to mention the involvement of (for example) the Ku Klux Klan in a similar campaign. The advertised purpose of the \"Freedom Ride\" was to de- mand that illegal immigrants in this country receive immedi-"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"Electing a New People 89 ate amnesty for breaking our nation's laws — and be allowed to bring in their extended families in the name of \"family re- unification.\" This process could conceivably result in our na- tion being inundated by tens of millions of unassimilated for- eigners. Indeed, this has happened before. In 1977, then-president Jimmy Carter declared that \"human rights\" considerations dictated a general amnesty for foreigners illegally in the United States — a population then numbering in the millions. That radical proposal was endorsed in 1980 by a special commission on immigr ation headed by Theodore Hesburgh: The panel recommended a general amnesty for illegal aliens, coupled with employer sanctions and a modest increase in funding for bo rder enforcement. Those recommendations were incorporated into the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA), which was sold to an anxious American public as a definitive \"solution\" to the crisis of illegal immigration. But rather than mitigating the im- migration onslaught, IRCA simply abetted it by opening up the process of \"chain immigration\" — and sending a potent signal that our borders could be violated with impunity. One Nation, Under NAFTA/FTAA Shortly after the conclusion of the Fall 2003 \"Freedom Ride,\" representatives of the radical groups sponsoring that demon- stration were brought to Washington by Senator John McCain (R-Ariz.) and several of his colleagues to lobby directly for passage of the disguised amnesty measure. 59 Mexican presi- dent Vicente Fox did his part by visiting three southwestern states — Texas, Arizona, and New Mexico — to lobby state legislatures to support the amnesty drive. \"We share nation and language,\" Fox told the New Mexico legislature. \"In addition to our geographical vicinity, we are united by inseparable bonds, history, values and interests.... We must join together.... You need Mexico and Mexicans, and we need you.\" Acting as the supposed leader of \"Mexicans liv-"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"90 America's Engineered Decline ing abroad,\" Fox demanded that lawmakers in this country \"fa- cilitate access to health care a nd education services for all those who share our border.... Wit hout this, it is impossible to think about the path to greater integration and shared prosper- ity.\" 60 Open borders, amnest y for illegals, subsidies for Mexico's economy, exporting manufacturing capacity south of the bor- der, expanded welfare benefits for foreigners who entered our nation illegally — these are all part of the same seamless de- sign. As Fox himself put it, that design is the \"integration\" of the U.S. and Mexico into a hemisphere-wide political unit. Foreign affairs analyst Robert D. Kaplan points out that \"the tumultuous historic consolidation of Mexico and the United States\" is just one facet of a process of \"global political con- vergence\" into a \"kind of loose world governance....\" As \"these two vastly unequal societies [the United States and Mexico] integrate at breakneck speed,\" the immediate result will be \"so- cial upheaval on both sides of the border.\" 61 \"Social upheaval\" is a remarkably antiseptic term to de- scribe the loss of our national identity, the importation of crim- inals and welfare parasites, the depression of our labor mar- kets and exportation of our manufacturing capacity, and the forcible \"downward harmonization\" of our living standard with that of Mexico. But from the perspective of the globalist elite — a view that Kaplan enthusiastically shares — this is simply the price that must be paid to bring about a unified world."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"C HAPTER S IX What Can We Do?

And it's certainly true that many of our problems and challenges have little if anything to do with the machina- tions of the shadowy collective entity referred to in these pages as the Power Elite. Nonetheless, as we have seen, that Elite has carefully and deliberately undertaken to u ndermine the American middle class and subvert our national independence. These develop- ments are not a result of blind, impersonal historical forces, or of innocent errors, honest mistakes, or lapses in judgment on the part of our leaders. Neither is our decline largely the un- fortunate outcome in a long-running ideological conflict be- tween liberty and collectivism. Simply put: Our prosperity, liberty, and national independ- ence are being stolen from us by those who seek total power over the entire globe. What we confront is a deliberate plot to \"harmonize\" our standard of living with that of other nations and \"integrate\" the United States into a centrally directed global economy, ruled by an entrenched and unaccountable transnational Power Elite. As illustrated by the foregoing quotes — and the evidence pro- vided in the previous chapters — this campaign is often shrouded by secrecy, and always involves a deliberate effort to deceive the public. In other words, it is, by strict and spe- cific definition, a conspiracy. Why Conspiracy Matters Contemporary Americans are somewhat schizoid on the sub- ject of conspiracy.

The same is true of movies, nov- els, and other diversions. When it comes to fiction, the Amer- ican public has no problem a ccepting the concept of conspir- acy-Public opinion surveys also suggest that most Americans perceive our government to be controlled by a Power Elite. The State of Disunion, a nationwide survey conducted by the Congressional Institute, found th at 80 percent of those polled agreed that \"our country is r un by a close network of special interests, public officials, an d the media,\" and that the gov- ernment itself \"is pretty much run by a few big interests look- ing out for themselves.\" 4 64 percent consider our ruling elite as amoral, indifferent to the public's concerns, and devoted ex- clusively to pursuing its own interests and agenda. 5 Yet only 24 percent — less than one-quarter — of Ameri- cans surveyed were willing to say that this powerful, corrupt, well-entrenched elite is \"involved in a conspiracy.\" Perhaps it should be considered predictable, then, that 60 percent of the respondents concluded mat \"people like me don't have any say about what the government does.\" 6 From that fatalistic per- spective, government corruption is simply an unalterable re- ality of life, as fixed and immu table as the laws of gravity. There is an important and sobering lesson here: A conspir- acy cannot be defeated unless it is recognized, and opposed, as such. If Americans are seri ously concerned about building a better life for themselves and their children, and they under- stand that our own government is controlled by corrupt, con- niving men determined to enrich themselves at the expense of our liberty and prosperity, then it follows that those schemers and their designs must be exposed, opposed, and defeated.

As late as the early to mid-1980s, some \"re- spectable\" opinion still maintained that the Mafia was a fig- ment of paranoid imagination. \"There does not exist, nor has there ever existed, an organized , secret, hierarchical criminal society called 'Mafia,' \" pontificated Italian scholar Pino Ar- lacchi in 1983. 7 In 1985, Virgil Peterson, a presidential con- sultant on organized crime a nd former head of Chicago's Crime Commission, dismissed as a \"myth\" the idea that the American Cosa Nostra \"is contro lled by a mystical and some- what romantic Sicilian Mafia with secret initiation rites....\" 8 As defectors from the Mafia be gan to come forward, they were greeted with scorn and derision — or worse — from pseudo-sophisticates in powerfu l academic, law enforcement, and political posts. In the early 1950s, as the Senate investi- gated Mafia activities, Harvard sociologist Daniel Bell dis- missed the inquiry, claiming that it had been \"misled by its own hearsay.\" Twenty years later, Mafia defector Leonardo Vi- tale testified against several of the conspiracy's highest leaders — only to have an Italian jury dismiss his testimony and consign him to a lunatic asylum for a decade. Shortly after Vi- tale was released from his unjust imprisonment, he was gunned down in the streets of Palermo. 9 The chief obstacle to dealing with the Mafia, complained Senator Estes Kefauver, a resolute enemy of the syndicate, was that for most Americans the idea of such a vast, long-lived, in- ternational conspiracy was \"so fantastic that most Americans have difficulty in believing it re ally exists.\" This public disbe-"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"What Can We Do? 95 lief was abetted by the obstinate refusal of public officials to recognize the existence of the Mafia conspiracy, and to fight it as such. \"No 'friends of the friends' in the Mafia sense could have served it so well as these upright, obstinate disbelievers,\" commented scholar Claire Sterlin g. \"Their refusal to see the plain truth was worse than misl eading; it effectively blocked any assault on the Mafia as an organized criminal body for over a century.\" 10 This began to change in the 1970s and 1980s when law en- forcement finally began to fight the Mafia as an identifiable conspiracy. Once the secrecy — and cultivated disbelief — that had shielded the Mafia conspiracy was dispelled, the ca- bal itself was decimated within two decades. Corrupt Government as a Racket The fate of the Mafia conspiracy has more relevance to our present circumstances than merely illustrating how \"re- spectable\" opinion can be wrong. When governments become corrupt, they take on the characteristics of criminal syndicates. As St. Augustine observed more than a millennium and a half ago in his treatise The City of God: \"Justice being taken away, what are kingdoms but vast robberies?\" Emancipated from the rule of law, and stripped of its humanitarian preten- sions, government simply becomes an engine of plunder, op- pression, and — ultimately — mass murder. In brief, corrupt governments become conspiracies against the liberties, prop- erty, and even the lives, of their subjects. The American Founders — men of learning, accomplish- ment, courage, and vision — understood these sobering real- ities. Their heroic campaign to win independence from Great Britain, and later to build a constitutional republic, began with the understanding that they we re battling a determined con- spiracy seeking to use government power to reduce the Amer- ican colonists to slavery. In his Pulitzer Prize-winning study of the ideological foun-"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"96 America's Engineered Decline dations of American independence, Harvard historian Bernard Bailyn noted that \"the fear of a comprehensive conspiracy against liberty throughout the English-speaking world — a conspiracy believed to have b een nourished in corruption, and of which, it was felt, oppression in America was only the most immediately visible part — lay at the heart of the Revolution- ary movement.\" The leaders of the drive for independence \"saw about them, with increasing clarity, not merely mistaken, or even evil, policies violating the principles upon which freedom rested, but nothing less than a deliberate assault launched surreptitiously by plotters against liberty.\" 11 British philosopher John Locke was among those whose wisdom inspired our Founders. In his Second Treatise on Gov- ernment, Locke presented a useful distinction between com- monplace governmental inefficiency and corruption on the one hand, and the malevolent design of conspirators bent on de- stroying liberty, on the other: Great mistakes in the rulin g part, many wrong and in- convenient laws, and all the slips of human frailty will be borne by the people without mutiny or murmur. But if a long train of abuses, prevarications, and artifices, all tending the same way, make the design visible to the people, and they cannot but feel what they lie under and see whither they are going, it is not to be wondered that they should then rouse themselves and endeavor to put the rule into such hands which may secure to them the ends for which government was at first erected....\" (Emphasis added). 12 As the familiar aphorism puts it: Even a dumb dog can dis- tinguish between being stumbled over and being kicked. One key to discerning conspi racy, according to Locke, is consistency — a series of policies and decisions that have the common tendency to enslave and impoverish a government's"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"What Can We Do? 97 subjects. Those trends suggest a \"design,\" secretly arrived at and pursued through deception — in brief, a conspiracy. The Founders, applying this wisdom to their circumstances, rec- ognized that the enemy they confronted was a conspiracy against their liberties. Writing on behalf of the pro-revolutionary cause in 1774, John Adams declared that \"the conspiracy [against the liber- ties of the colonists] was first regularly formed and begun to be executed in 1763 or 4....\" 13 In an essay published that same year, Thomas Jefferson en- dorsed Adams' perception, and pointed out that British poli- cies toward the colonies disp layed a conspiratorial pattern. While \"single acts of tyranny ma y be ascribed to the accidental opinion of a day,\" Jefferson advise d, \"a series of oppressions, begun at a distinguished period, and pursued unalterably through every change of ministers, too plainly prove a deliberate and systematical plan of reducing us to slavery.\" 14 After initially seeking to vindicate their \"ancient rights as Englishmen\" as subjects of th e British Crown, the Founders eventually came to realize that they could only do so as citi- zens of free and independent states. The Declaration of Inde- pendence, invoking Locke's anti-conspiratorial language, as- serted that separation from Grea t Britain was made necessary because \"a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing in- variably the same Object, evinces a design to reduce [us] under absolute Despotism....\" America's independence was thus a triumph of the anti- conspiratorial worldview, as is our Constitution. Dr. Bailyn — a liberal academic who holds no brief for \"conspiracy theo- rists\" — was compelled by his research to conclude that \"the American Constitution is the final and climactic expression of the ideology of the American Revolution\" — an ideology that he described as anti-conspiratorial. 15 America's Founders would have no difficulty recognizing that there is a conspiracy behind the unfolding campaign to"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"98 America's Engineered Decline eradicate the middle class and absorb our nation into a cen- trally ruled global regime. Yet they would not have to rely on circumstantial evidence to form such a conclusion. Controlling the Alternatives Just as there were key Mafia insiders who blew the whistle on that criminal syndicate, former Insiders have exposed the workings of the Power Elite. The most important of those fig- ures is the late Georgetown University political scientist Car- roll Quigley — an academic recognized as a mentor by (of all people) Bill Clinton, who used his 1992 nomination accept- ance speech to laud Quigley before a world audience. In his monumental study Tragedy and Hope, Quigley of- fers a relatively brief but priceless examination of the role in modern history played by the Power Elite — a self-perpetuat- ing international clique bent on dominating the world. Having examined that cabal's intimat e documents, Quigley approved of its objectives, taking issue only with its determination to avoid publicizing its stealthy pursuit of global hegemony: I know of the operations of this network because I have studied it for twenty years and was permitted for two years, in the early 1960's, to examine its papers and secret records. I have no aversion to it or to most of its aims and have, for much of my life, been close to it and to many of its instruments.... In general, my chief difference of opinion is that it wishes to remain unknown.... [The network's objective is] nothing less than to create a world system of financial control in private hands able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole. This system was to be controlled in a feudalist fashion by the central banks of the world acting in concert by secret meetings and conferences. The apex of the system was to be ... a private bank owned and controlled by the world's central banks"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"What Can We Do? 99 which were themselves private corporations. Each central bank ... sought to dominate its government by its ability to control treasury loans, to manipulate foreign exchanges, to influence the level of economic activity in the country, and to influence cooperative politic ians by subsequent economic rewards in the business world. 16 According to Thomas Jefferson's indictment, the conspiracy against the colonies made itself known through \"a series of oppressions, begun at a distinguished period, and pursued unalterably through every change of ministers....\" The effort to create the centrally controlled economy described by Quigley has displayed similar consistency. That program — which would require reversing our national independence, and reducing our middle class to peonage — has continued unchecked for at least a century, and has been pursued through every change of administration, whether Republican or Dem- ocrat. This isn't a case of globalist, big government Democrats versus conservative, nationalist Republicans. Rather, it's the operation of a powerful, entrench ed elite that effectively con- trols the leadership of both major parties. Toward the end of his voluminous study, Professor Quigley — who, remember, shared the Power Elite's objectives — of- fered some telling observations about what he considered to be the proper role of partisan politics. Disdaining the idea that \"the two parties should represent opposed ideals and policies,\" Quigley insisted that \"the two parties should be almost identical, so that the American peo- ple can 'throw the rascals out' at any election without leading to any profound or extensive shifts in policy.\" When the elec- torate grows weary of one of the Establishment parties, Quigley continued, \"it should be able to replace it, every four years if necessary, by the other party, which ... will still pursue, with new vigor, approximately the same basic policies.\" 17 "},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"100 America' s Engineered Decline The policies alluded to by Quigley — namely, incessant en- tanglement in foreign conflicts, and the relentless growth of socialism at home — constitute the much-heralded \"bipartisan consensus.\" It is more accurately described as a pact between the parasites and plunderers — that is, the government and its favored constituencies — against the interests of the productive class. Like Quigley, the late social critic Christopher Lasch doc- umented the existence of this c onspiratorial Power Elite, which he designated the \"New Class.\" Unlike Quigley, however, Lasch condemned the Power Elite's machinations: \"Those who control the international flow of money and information, preside over the philanthropic foundations and institutions of higher learning, manage the instruments of cultural produc- tion and thus set the terms of public debate ... have lost faith in the values, or what remains of them, of the West.\" 18 Many of the most influential members of that elite, Lasch observed, \"have ceased to think of themselves as Americans in any important sense, implicated in America's destiny for better or for worse.\" As a result, they are \"deeply indifferent to the prospect of American decl ine.\" In fact, that elite heartily reviles \"Middle America,\" a term which \"has come to sym- bolize everything that stands in the way of progress\": patriot- ism, religious devotion, strong family commitments, and con- ventional morality. 19 Let's March! Like the Mafia, the Power Elite commands tremendous wealth and power, yet its most formidable weapon remains deception. And, like the Mafia, its single greatest vulnerability is expo- sure. Thus its designs can still be defeated if a sufficient number of Americans can be informed, organized, and mobilized — if, to paraphrase John Locke, we can \"rouse [ourselves] and endeavor to put the rule into such hands which may secure..."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"What Can We Do? 101 the ends for which governme nt was at first erected....\" Most Americans, serene in the misplaced confidence that they live in the best of all possible worlds, don't realize three very important things: • First, that their immediate ancestors — say, their parents and grandparents — enjoyed a higher standard of living than they do, measured in terms of what they owned, what they owed, and what they could transmit to their heirs. • Second, that while the United States of America remains a \"middle-class nation,\" it is tragically unlikely that it will remain so a generation from now, if it continues on its present course. • Third, that this reflects the labors of a conspiratorial elite that can and must be defeated through organized, princi- pled action. What would happen if a sufficient number of Americans came to understand these three unsettling, but vital truths? We can see one possible outcome in the history of our struggle for independence. Our Founders faced a predicament similar to ours. They had an extensive heritage of liberty, but confronted the daunting task of defeating a conspiracy against their liberties that had at its disposal the wealth and power of the world's most for- midable empire. Yet our Founders — through courageous, principled, organized effort, and with God's help — prevailed in their struggle for independ ence, and succeed ed in creating our constitutional republic. Because of their heroic labors, our task — unnerving though it may be — is much simpler: We have a constitutional framework that can still work, if Ameri- cans can be taught to use it correctly. For nearly a half-century, The John Birch Society has done the vital work of exposing the Power Elite and its conspirato- rial designs. The JBS has also led the way in educating the public about our heritage of limited government under law, and"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"102 America's Engineered Decline the role of an informed, mobilized electorate in reducing the size, scope, expense, and invasiveness of government. Long before it became fashiona ble, the Society urged our nation to withdraw from the United Nations, the IMF, the World Bank, and other foreign entanglements. Today the JBS is leading the fight to prevent creation of the so-called Free Trade Area of the Americas — an EU-style regional govern- ment. Creating the FTAA is perhaps the highest immediate pri- ority of the criminal conspiracy that seeks to impoverish and enslave us. Defeating the FTAA should thus be the highest pri- ority of those who cherish what it s architects seek to destroy. And this is a struggle that we can win — if a sufficient num- ber of Americans are informed and mobilized in time. While defeating the FTAA is vital, it is not sufficient. We must also end our nation's entanglement in needless foreign conflicts, as well as our involvement in the UN and its affili- ates; we must stop foreign aid, including the subsidized export of our manufacturing capacity abroad; we must restore control over our nation's borders. Just as importantly, our central government has to be trimmed back to proper constitutional size, so that our businesses are no longer being suffocated be- neath regulations and bled dry by taxes. The organized effort to destroy our civilization requires an organized opposition; when confronting combinations of bad men bent on total power, good people who love liberty must combine their efforts as well. The JBS has a proper under- standing of the enemy, a winning strategy to defeat it, and the necessary organizational framework. The JBS program can succeed if enough Americans will enlist in this vital effort, while time remains."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"Appendices"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"A PPENDIX I Descent into Degeneracy [Let us] create public schools where, as soon as they are weaned, the young may be reared; installed therein as ward of the State, the child can fo rget even his mother's name.

During the intermission of a tautly contested game, the New England Patriots and the Car- olina Panthers surrendered the stage to what was appropriately described as a collection of \"seemingly drugged, indifferent, writhing pagan figures.\" \"These [were] not living human beings in action,\" contin- ued cultural critic Michael Novak, but rather \"sacks of flesh, writhing, grinding, pawing, acting out no higher appeal than bodily functions....

The standout of this de- generate collection was Kid Rock, a talent-less, greasy-haired fleck of urban flotsam whose output (like most rap \"music\") is riddled with twelve-letter profanities. During the halftime show, Kid Rock celebrated America's favorite sporting event by garbing himself in a poncho fashioned from a desecrated American flag.

A debauched and dum bed-down culture is not one that will long remain prosperous and free. But the truly ironic thing about the controversy triggered by Super Bowl XXXVIII's halftime show is this: Repellent though it was, it is entirely typical of the popular culture in which American youth are immersed. And the impact of that toxic culture can be felt in ev en respectable American com- munities. Lost Children Rockdale County, Georgia seemed to exemplify middle-class America. The Atlanta suburb played host to equestrian events during the 1996 Summer Olympics. The local economy was strong, the county school system was well-funded. Most resi- dents of Conyers, the only town in the county, were materially comfortable and active in local churches. Thus it came as a shock when a syphilis outbreak occurred among Rockdale teenagers in the spring of 1996. 8 Local health officials investigating the outbreak discovered behind Rockdale's middle-class facade a culture of predatory promiscuity rivaling — or even surpassing — that of the worst slums. \"It was not uncommon, when all the young people would get together, to engage in group sex,\" commented Professor Claire Sterk of the nearby Emory University School of Public Health, in the 1999 PBS Frontline documentary \"The Lost Children of Rockdale County.\" \"There was group sex going on in terms of one guy having sex with one of the girls, and then the next guy having sex with the same girl. There was group sex going on in terms of one girl having sex with mul- tiple male partners at the same time, multiple females having sex with each other at the same time. I would say that the only type of group sex that I did not hear about in this overall con- text was group sex between just guys.\" 9 "},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"Descent into Degeneracy 109 Registered Nurse Cynthia Noel, who was among those who discovered the epidemic, referred to 14-year-old girls \"with 20,30,40,50 or 100 sex partners. You expect that of someone who is more into the line of being a prostitute or something.\" According to middle-school guidance counselor Peggy Coop- er, the group sex incidents involved girls as young as 12 years old. \"The parents were off and gone,\" observed Cooper. \"And they said they were watching the Playboy Channel in the girl's bedroom. And there would be, like, 10 or 12 of them up there.\" 10 One young boy told Cooper about the \"game\" their group had devised in which \"you have to imitate what the Playboy people are doing.\" Another boy told her that \"there may be three or four of us at one time. And it doesn't matter if you're two guys or two girls or a girl and a guy. It doesn't matter. You just have to do what they're doing.\" 11 Another participant in the sex games recalled another party at which a young girl, equipped with \"the bag of condoms we got from the health department,\" set out to have sex with every boy in the room. The boys at the party were \"lined up ... it was like they were from th e [bedroom] door to the front door.... And then she came out . She ... thought it was the coolest thing.\" 12 The most horrifying segment of the program was an inter- view with three students identified as Katy, Bridget and Chris- tine, who at the time were be tween 12 and 14 years of age. Like many of their friends, these waif-like girls were devoted fans of \"hip-hop\" and hardcore rap \"music,\" a supposed art form produced by the gutter dregs of the inner city criminal subculture. Liberal columnist Bob Herbert describes such \"music\" as the soundtrack of a \" 'Lord of th e Flies' street culture that is seducing one generation after another of black children, and producing freakish entertainers like Nelly and 50 Cent.\" Nelly (who was among the performers featured at Super Bowl"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"110 America's Engineered Decline XXXVIII) is a \"rapper\" from St. Louis whose breakthrough hit was entitled \"Pimp Juice.\" 50 Cent, the best-selling artist of 2003, hit the big-time with a ditty entitled \"P.I.M.P.,\" an- other celebration of street prostitution. The world inhabited by such alleged musicians is an inner- city hell-hole in which women are sexual playthings and males are willing to murder each othe r over any perceived offense. \"We've got insane young men who take their heavy armament into the street and shoot up the neighborhood, and then go back inside to listen to music that celebrates the act of shooting up the neighborhood,\" laments Herbert. 13 Katy, Bridget, and Christine lived in an almost entirely white, middle-class suburb, rather than an inner-city ghetto. But the Culture of Death, a full-service industry, delivers to the suburbs. Through MTV, those young girls became im- mersed in the \"hip-hop\" lifestyle. Prompted by the interviewer, the three girls — children — lapsed into something akin to a rhythmic trance while reciting the words to one of their fa- vorite rap \"songs\" — an anatomically explicit celebration of group sex. \"Is that something anybody does around here?\" in- quires the reporter. \"Uh-huh! Lots of people. A lot of people,\" the girls replied. 14 Just as shocking is the observation by one health worker that the girls who were involved in the Rockdale County or- gies \"were not homeless. They were not abused in any way. These were just normal, everyday, regular kids.\" 15 As if to un- derscore this point, the documentary described the goings-on at nearby Panama City, Florida, \"a playground for teenagers from all over the country,\" according to the narration. \"At the height of the season, thousands of high school students jam the two-lane highway and crowd the beaches, partying all night. Fights break out spontaneously and kids have sex in full view on the sand and on motel balconies overlooking the strip.\" The wages of the perverse \"freedom\" enjoyed by Rockdale County youth were not limited to venereal disease.

Snugly en- sconced in the Bible Belt, firmly entrenched in \"Red State\" America, Rockdale offered no haven from the dominant post- Christian culture. It was as if Mayberry had been transformed into Gomorrah. Rockdale seemed to experience a harmonic convergence of troubling social trends: Overworked parents working up to 60 hours a week to retain a middle- class lifestyle; over-scheduled schoolchildren more passionately connected to their peers than to their families; an aggressively amoral school-based sex ed- ucation system (typified by the bag of condoms toted by the young girl at the party mentioned above); and a deeply sub- versive, sex-saturated popular culture. The \"lost children\" of Rockdale County are tragically typ- ical of many American youth. This is not a reflection of cul- tural drift, but rather of a cultural hijacking. The lost youth didn't simply wander away; they have been carefully and delib- erately misled as part of a scheme intended to capture our cul- ture. The late cultural commentator Richard Grenier observed that \"capture the culture\" was the battle cry of Italian Com- munist leader Antonio Gramsci. Consigned to prison by Mus- solini (a one-time ally who imposed a different brand of mil- itant collectivism on Italy), Gramsci \"formulated in his Prison Notebooks the doctrine that those who want to change society must change man's consciousness, and that in order to ac- complish this they must first control the institutions by which that consciousness is formed: schools, universities, churches, and, perhaps above all, art and the communications industry,\" recalled Grenier. \"It is these institutions that shape and artic-"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"112 America's Engineered Decline ulate 'public opinion,' the limits of which few politicians can violate with impunity. Culture, Gramsci felt, is not simply the superstructure of an economic base — the role assigned to it in orthodox Marxism — but is central to a society.\" 17 Gramsci urged those who sought to bring about a \"revolu- tion in the state\" to pursue the steady, incremental subversion of free societies by conducting a \"long march through the in- stitutions.\" In some ways the Gramscian approach is kindred to that pursued by Britain's Fa bian socialists, who chose \"pa- tient gradualism,\" rather than violent insurrection, as the most effective means to collectivize society. Gramsci's distinctive insight was to urge Marxists to escape from the shackles of economic theory and focus instead on society's cultural organs — the press and other media, education, entertainment, reli- gion, and the family. In order for revolutionaries to establish \"political leadership or hegemony,\" advised Gramsci, they \"must not count solely on the power and material force of gov- ernment\"; they must change the culture upon which that gov- ernment was built. Irredeemable Depravity Many cultural commentators target the 1960s as the decade in which our Gramscian cultural revolution took hold. But the revolution actually occurred decad es before its effects began to be noticed. In his monumental 1966 study Tragedy and Hope, the late Georgetown University historian Carroll Quigley observed: \"The period since 1950 has seen the beginnings of a revolu- tionary change in American politics. This change is not so closely related to changes in Amer ican economic life as it is to the transformation in social life.... What has been happening has been a disintegration of the middle class.... This dis- integration of the middle classes had a variety of causes, some of them intrinsic, many of them accidental, a few of them ob- vious, but many of them going deeply into the very depths of"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"Descent into Degeneracy 113 social existence. All these caus es acted to destroy the middle classes by acting to destroy the middle-class outlook.\" 18 The chief \"internal cause\" of the \"disintegration of the mid- dle class\" described by Quigley was not economic adversity, but rather the failure of that class \"to transfer its outlook to its children ... [a] failure [that] occurred chiefly within the mid- dle-class family...\" 19 The most important \"external cause\" was \"the relentless attack [on middle-class values and institutions] in literature and drama throughout most of the twentieth cen- tury. In fact, it is difficult to find works that defended this out- look or even assumed it to be true, as was frequent in the nine- teenth century.\" 20 By mid-century, popular literature, drama, cinema, and the embryonic medium of television trafficked in \"violence, social irresponsibility, sexual laxi ty and perversion ... human weakness in relation to alcohol, narcotics, or sex.... The philo- sophic basis for this attack was found in an oversimplified Freudianism that regarded all suppression of human impulse as leading to frustration and psychic distortions that made sub- sequent life unattainable. Thus novel after novel or play after play portrayed the wickedness of the suppression of good, healthy, natural impulse and the salutary consequences of self- indulgence, especially in sex. Adultery and other manifesta- tions of undisciplined sexuality were described in increasingly clinical detail....\" 21 The result of this \"revolt against the middle class,\" Quigley pointed out, was \"a total reversal of middle-class values by presenting as interesting or admirable simple negation of these values by aimless, shiftless, and totally irresponsible people.\" The entertainment industry was overwhelmed with \"swamps of perversions ranging from homosexuality, incest, sadism ... to cannibalism, necrophilia, and coprophagia.\" 22 Bear in mind that Quigley wrote those words in the mid- 1960s. That was an era when television censors wouldn't al- low Barbara Eden, the buxom star of the sitcom \"I Dream of"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"114 America's Engineered Decline Jeanie,\" to display her navel; an era in which most local com- munities still had, and enforced, \"blue laws,\" anti-obscenity ordinances, and other codes of public morality; it was a time prior to the 1969 Stonewall riot that inaugurated the homo- sexual revolution, and the 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision strik- ing down state anti-abortion laws. As one who had privileged access to the \"papers and secret records\" of the Power Elite, Quigley was describing not only what was taking place at the farthest fringes of radical culture, but also what the radicals an d their Establishment mentors planned to inflict on our nation. (The chapter from which these observations are taken is entitled \"The Future in Perspective.\") The exponents of revolution denigrate the biblical view of man as a special creation of God placed \"a little lower than the an- gels.\" As Quigley pointed out, the revolutionaries viewed man as \"lower than any animal would naturally descend. From this has emerged the Puritan view of man (but without the Puritan view of God) as a creature of total depravity in a deterministic universe without hope of any redemption.\" 23 To what end would this be done? Quigley pointed out that one strain of Puritanism was invoked in the 16th and 17th cen- turies (most notably in Thomas Hobbes' essay Leviathan) to justify despotism in the name of public order. The new doc- trine of depravity \"now may be used, with petty-bourgeois [lower and lower-middle-class] support, to justify a new des- potism to preserve, by force instead of conviction, petty-bour- geois values in a system of compulsory conformity.\" 24 In a self-governing society, public morality and private morality cannot be segregated. People who have abandoned what George Washington referred to as the \"eternal rules of order and right\" will be incapable of exercising the self-disci- pline necessary to maintain a free government. In his Farewell Address, Washington advised that there is \"no truth more thoroughly established than that there exists in the economy and course of nature an indissoluble union be-"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"Descent into Degeneracy 115 tween virtue and happiness; between duty and advantage; be- tween the genuine maxims of an honest and magnanimous pol- icy and the solid rewards of public prosperity and felicity.\" When such habits of virtue are cultivated and preserved, so- ciety can enjoy the blessings of limited government — one that will, in Jefferson's words, \"restrain men from injuring one an- other, [and which] shall leave them otherwise free to regulate their own pursuits of industry and improvement, and shall not take from the mouth of labor the bread it has earned.\" Once those moral habits are discarded — or deliberately destroyed through subversion — the despotism of the Total State be- comes the only altern ative to anarchy. And this is precisely the plan followed by Gramsci's disci- ples. Elitist/Smut-peddler Axis In an abortive investigation conducted in 1954, Tennessee Congressman Carroll Reece exposed significant elements of the Gramscian network laboring to destroy the American mid- dle class. The Reece Committee probed the connections be- tween tax-exempt foundations and various subversive organi- zations — most notably, the Council on Foreign Relations — working to bring about our nation's submergence in a global government. The inquiry also examined the work of left-lean- ing social scientists (such as Alfred Kinsey) and legal activists to destroy our country's moral foundations. These cultural revolutionaries, warned Congressman Reece, sought to create a public culture in which \"there are no absolutes, that everything is indeterminate, that no standards of conduct, morals, ethics, and government are to be deemed inviolate, that everything, including basic moral law, is sub- ject to change, and that it is the part of the social scientists to take no principle for granted as a premise in social or juridical reasoning, however fundamental it may hereto have been deemed to be under our Judeo-Christian moral system.\" 25 "},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"116 America's Engineered Decline One of the most consequential beneficiaries of foundation funding (particularly from the Rockefellers) was Alfred C. Kinsey, lead author of the 1948 report Sexual Behavior in the Human Male. Former Kinsey Institute adviser James H. Jones, who knew Kinsey intimately, describes the renowned sexolo- gist as a militant homosexual who sought to demolish Amer- ica's conventional morality. 26 Wardell Pomeroy, a close associate of Kinsey, recalled that \"Kinsey knew a great deal about the Judeo-Christian tradition, and he was indignant about what it had done to our culture.\" 27 In their Report on Male Sexuality, Kinsey and his associates candidly expressed the view that \"healthy\" sexuality ignores all distinctions regarding \"right and wrong, licit and illicit, nor- mal and abnormal, acceptable and unacceptable....\" 28 The subjects used by Kinsey as a supposedly representa- tive sample of American society were recruited from homo- sexual bars and culled from the ra nks of sex offenders. In or- der to demonstrate that human beings are \"sexual creatures\" practically from birth, Kinsey and his comrades conducted ghastly experiments involving the \"clinical\" molestation of newborn infants. 29 Among those who collaborated with Kinsey was Rene Guy- on, a French Marxist and pederast who coined the saying, \"sex by age eight or else it's too late.\" According to international sexologist Dr. Harry Benjamin (an associate of both Kinsey and Guyon), \"Guyon developed a deconstructed legal theory [of sexual liberation], fortifyi ng it with Kinsey's 'scientific' data. It was put into the hands of legal radicals like Morris Ernst, an advocate for the new sexual order, who handled rev- olutionary cases in his war against the American legal order.\" To bring about the sexual revolution, nothing less than the utter demolition of the existing legal culture would suffice. In Ernst's 1948 book American Sexual Behavior and the Kinsey Report, Kinsey colleague Robert Dickinson claimed that \"vir- tually every page of the Kinsey Report touches on some sec-"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"Descent into Degeneracy 117 tion of the legal code ... a reminder that the law, like ... our social pattern, falls lamentably short of being based on a knowledge of facts.\" Harmonizing American law with Kin- sey's perverted vision of sexual emancipation became the mis- sion of Ernst and his revolutionary associates. Ernst was wired into the Gramscian network. He was affil- iated with the American Civ il Liberties Union (ACLU), the Sex Information and Education Council of the United States (SIECUS), and Planned Parenthood of America. He also en- joyed close ties to Supreme Court Justices Brandeis, Brennan, and Frankfurter, and Judge Lear ned Hand — all of whom were key judicial change agents in removing legal protections for conventional morality, the traditional family, and the sanctity of life. Another of Kinsey's key legal allies was Professor Herbert Wechsler, a noted legal scholar at Columbia University, a one- time close confidant of President Franklin Roosevelt, and member of the National Lawyers Guild, a legal front for the Communist Party. Drawing on Ki nsey's \"research,\" Wechsler composed a Model Penal Code for the American Legal Insti- tute (ALI), a Rockefeller- and Carnegie-subsidized educational arm of the American Bar Associat ion. The key element of that model statute — what lawyers would call the \"gravamen\" — is that there should be no \"criminal penalties for consensual sexual relations conducted in private.\" The next year, the ALI Model Penal Code was immediately touted as a model to state legislatures. Ernst urged his Gram- scian comrades to \"establish a Committee on the Laws of Sex- ual Behavior and consider their own State's legal system in this field....\" In short order, those committees were established with funding from the Rockefeller Foundation, and — using the Model Penal Code as their model — those committees be- gan working for new laws that either eliminated or trivialized sex crimes, from homosexuality to public indecency. At the same time, Ernst's comrades in the federal court sys-"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"118 America's Engineered Decline tern — including allies on the Supreme Court — carried out a flanking attack against states and communities that didn't toe the ALI line. In a string of decisions dealing with contracep- tion (Griswold v. Connecticut, 1965; Eisenstadt v. Baird, 1972; Carey v. Population Services International, 1977), pornogra- phy (Miller v. California, 1973), and abortion (Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton, 1973), the Supreme Court usurped the state governments' reserved powers to set social policies regarding moral issues. For many of the Libertarian or libertine persuasion, these developments were a welcome emancipation of the individual from onerous laws regulating moral conduct. But the crusade to liberate the libido had contributed greatly to the demolition of the constitutional powers reserved to states and local com- munities, while simultaneously enhancing the powers of the central government. And the horrifying experience of Rock- dale County — as well as thousands of other communities — illustrates that the sexual revolution has entered its own reign of terror. \"Social Marketing\" of Porn For Rockdale County's lost children, pornography — specif- ically the Playboy Channel — offered detailed tutorials in sexual degeneracy. This is entirely in keeping with the pur- pose of modern pornography: Rather than simply catering to prurient interests, porn carries out a revolutionary function. Speaking in the 1980s, Hugh Hefner — the founder of the Playboy empire — boasted: \"The generation now running so- ciety is the first Playboy generation.\" 30 Playboy and its de- scendants have done more than any other institution, judicial ruling, or media organ to propagate Kinsey's gospel of post- Christian sexual emancipation. Dr. Judith Reisman elaborates on the grim reality behind Hefner's triumph:"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"Descent into Degeneracy 119 [T]his is largely a Playboy-reared society as well. And it is a Kinsey-reared society as well. Hefner and Kinsey share the responsibility for a generation of heterophobia — fear and distrust of the opposite sex — wide-spread drug use and addiction, impotence and homosexuality, suicide, astronomical divorce rates, epidemics of venereal disease, and AIDS.... Both Kinsey and Hefner battled for the elimination and libera lization of sex laws.... Eventually tens of thousands of criminals, primarily sex offenders, were paroled back into society.... The measure of success for Kinsey and Hefner can be seen everywhere. Post Kinsey/Hefner, the profession of 'sexology' was created to cope with a massive increase in cases of sexual disorders. Building on its fraudulent research base, sexology crept into higher education, medicine, counseling, therapy, law and public policy, sex and AIDS education, curricula, and political lobbying. 31 Hefner's empire created a tax-exempt foundation to re-in- vest a portion of its extravagant profits in funding subversive \"research.\" 32 \"Playboy is one of the most important magazines in the world, in terms of the impact it's had not only on social mores but as a champion of individual rights,\" boasted Hef-- ner in 1974. \"We've supported countless civil liberties or- ganizations, political reform, sex research and education, abor- tion reform before it became po pular, prison reform, and the continuing campaign to reform our repressive sex and drug laws ...\" 33 Indeed, following the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v. Wade decision abolishing state laws protecting unborn human be- ings from abortion, Playboy conspicuously cut itself in for a share of the credit. \"The Playboy Foundation participated in a movement that won a major court victory,\" crowed the maga- zine's January 1974 issue. \"The victory came with last Janu- ary's Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion. This was es-"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"120 America's Engineered Decline pecially gratifying because of the Foundation's long campaign for reform, which began in 1966.\" 34 Incredible as it may seem, Hefner and his creation have ac- tually been embraced by some self-styled conservatives. William F. Buckley Jr., the media-designated leader of Amer- ican conservatism, has been a frequent contributor to the pages of Hefner's smut sheet. National Review, Buckley's magazine, ran not one but two laudatory pieces mark ing the 50th an- niversary of Hefner's porn empire. 35 One of them insisted that \"Playboy really does have something to do with freedom, and these days maybe that's worth remembering. A society that al- lows Playboy is not a society that allows women to be stoned to death for adultery.\" 36 Indeed not: On the basis of our national experience we can safely say that a society that allows Playboy will — within the course of a generation — embr ace legalized and subsidized child-killing and repeal many of the laws intended to protect women from sexual violence. Godfather of the Smut Industry But Hefner has long been eclipsed — both as a porn kingpin and \"social activist\" — by Harvard-educated Philip Harvey, the so-called \"Godfather\" of the porn industry. From his redoubt in Hillsborough, North Carolina, Harvey operates PHE, Inc. — the nation's largest distributor of hard- core porn videos and other sex-related products. Like Mafia chieftains trekking to New York City to confer with the \"Commission\" heading La Cosa Nostra, the leading produc- ers of smut films regularly travel to Hillsborough in search of financing and project approval. 37 Harvey himself regularly treks to Washington, D.C., to su- pervise Population Services International, a nonprofit corpo- ration that works closely with the federal government and in- ternational organizations to promote population control over- seas. To Harvey, peddling porn and promoting an anti-natal"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"Descent into Degeneracy 121 agenda are part of the same mission, which he describes as \"social marketing\" — applying \"the power and creativity of the private sector to family planning.\" In 1969, as a graduate student at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, Har- vey received a grant from the Ford Foundation (a major un- derwriter of cultural subversion) to do graduate work on \"family planning.\" His graduate thesis was a proposal for mail-order marketing of condoms — a revolutionary idea that essentially served as a business proposal for PHE, Inc. 38 For its first few years, Harvey's mail-order business floun- dered. His fortunes turned around, however, when he began to include erotic photographs in his catalog. In 1975, Harvey in- troduced the \"Adam & Eve\" catalog, which marketed sex aids and hard-core pornography along with \"socially responsible\" contraceptives. Most importan tly, Harvey's mail-order busi- ness (which Supreme Court rulings made possible by over- turning laws against interstate commerce in pornography) gave porn consumers anonymity and privacy. They no longer had to skulk about in dingy neighborhoods, casting around furtive glances in fear of being recogni zed. Thirty million copies of the \"Adam & Eve\" catalog are di stributed each year, attracting more than two million paying customers. All of PHE's products are vetted by consultants from an august-sounding group called the American Association of Sex Educators, Counselors, and Therapists. 39 Harvey's fortune, built one \"plain brown wrapper\" at a time, put him in the interesting position of being simultaneously pur- sued and courted by the federal government. \"During the late 1980s, while officials at the Justice Department were doing all they could to put Harvey in prison for obscenity violations, of- ficials at the State Department's Agency for International De- velopment were working closely with him to make contra- ceptives widely available in the Third World,\" observes inves- tigative author Eric Schlosser. 40 The federal crackdown on the porn industry during the Rea-"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"122 America's Engineered Decline gan and Bush I administrations \"wiped out many of [Harvey's] mail-order competitors and dissuaded others from entering the business\" — thereby giving the Ford-funded Establishment pornographer what amounts to a federally protected conces- sion. And while Harvey continues to rake in money from his mail-order skin trade, he \"still travels regularly to developing nations to meet with the administrators of his family planning projects,\" notes Schlosser. While the alliance between America's porn \"Godfather\" and the international population control movement may strike some as ironic, it's actually entirely appropriate: All of these people view the conventional American middle class family as the enemy. Breaking down America's middle-class — and pre- venting other societies from adopting it as a model — is their shared objective. In 1967, British population control activist Kingsley Davis pointed out that the social fact ors relevant to reducing the growth of the human population are \"beyond the control of family planning ... the social structure and economy must be changed before a deliberate reduction in the birthrate can be achieved.... Changes basic enough to affect motivation for hav- ing children would be changes in the structure of the family, in the position of women and in the sexual mores.\" 41 Two years later, Frederic Jaff e, president of Planned Par- enthood, elaborated on Davis's recommendations in a memo- randum to Bernard Berelson, president of the Population Council. (The Population Council was created by David Rock- efeller as a means of coordinating international population control efforts.) The Berelson Memorandum, which was published in the October 1970 issue of Family Planning Perspectives, listed four categories of population control options: \"Social Con- straints,\" \"Economic Deterrents/Incentives,\" \"Social Controls,\" and \"Housing Policies.\" Among the \"Social Constraints\" dis- cussed in this population control blueprint could be found"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"Descent into Degeneracy 1 23 \"compulsory education of children,\" the encouragement of \"in- creased homosexuality,\" as well as propaganda and social en- gineering efforts to alter the \"ima ge of the ideal family.\" Other draconian measures contemplated in that memo included placement of \"fertility control agen ts in [the] water supply,\" \"compulsory abortion of out-of-wedlock pregnancies,\" steril- ization of couples following their second child, and the is- suance of government \"permits\" to couples as a condition of having children. 42 Clear-cutting Society \"For more than five centuries,\" writes Atlantic Monthly in- vestigative reporter Eric Schlosser in his new book Reefer Madness, \"radical social movements [have] embraced pornog- raphy.\" From Renaissance-era huma nists, to the leaders of the 18th-century \"Enlightenment\" (including the notorious Mar- quis de Sade), to the exponents of the San Francisco-based 1960s counterculture, pornography has been used to bring about \"a profound shift in public attitudes toward sex, as reli- gious influences gave way to secular ones.\" 43 In the case of 21st Century America, that shif t has been accomplished with astonishing speed. In the January 1996 issue of the Marxist journal Dissent, Michael Walzer took stock of the victories won by the radical left in the Culture War — which he tellingly described as \"the Gramscian war of position.\" 44 Among the triumphs Walzer listed were: • \"The emergence of gay rights politics, and ... the atten- tion paid to it in the media\"; • \"The transformation of family life: the first successful challenge to male authority and the traditional division of labor [within the home]... rising divorce rates, changing sexual mores, new household arrangements — and, again, the portrayal of all this in the media\"; • \"The progress of secularization; the fading of religion in"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"124 America's Engineered Decline general and Christianity in particular from the public sphere — classrooms, textbooks, legal codes, holidays, and so on\"; • \"The legalization of abortion.\" 45 What Walzer describes is the clear-cutting of all social in- stitutions — beginning with the middle-class family — that impede the creation of the Total State. Again, many might find it difficult to believe that radical sexual emancipation can co-exist with severe political regi- mentation. But this approach was used quite successfully by the architects of Swed en's all-encompassing socialist welfare state. \" 'Freedom' in Swedish is a word that appears to be taboo,\" observed British journalist Roland Huntford in his 1971 book The New Totalitarians, a critical study of Sweden's version of cradle-to-grave collectivism. \"There is one excep- tion, however, and that is in sexual matters. In the same way that 'security' is the creed of [Swedish socialist] politics, so is 'liberty' that of sex.\" 46 This connection between sexual license and political tyranny was described by Al dous Huxley in the preface to the 1948 edition of his masterpiece Brave New World: As political and economic freedom diminishes, sexual freedom tends compensatingly to increase. And the dictator (unless he needs cannon fodder and families with which to colonize empty or conquered territories) will do well to encourage that freedom. In co njunction with the freedom to daydream under the influence of dope, the movies and the radio, [sexual emancipation] will help to reconcile his subjects to the servitude which is their fate."},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"A PPENDIX II The Wages of Perpetual War Of all the enemies to public liberty, war is, perhaps, the most to be dreaded, because it comprises and develops the germ of every other.

In fact, where war is permissible, it is essentially mandatory: No moral man can refuse to fight when necessary to protect the innocent and defend freedom. The Armed Forces of the United States have a noble and honorable legacy. They also have the distinction of being the first fighting force in human history created for the exclusive purpose of upholding the principles of republican liberty en- shrined in a written constitution. Our independence and liberty depend, to a large extent, on the willingness of Americans to enlist for service under our nation's flag. The American Founding Fathers, who had wrested their in- dependence from Great Britain by trial of arms, understood the necessity of providing for a strong defense. They also un- derstood, and moved to pre-empt, the danger posed by stand- ing military establishments, which historically have been per- verted into instruments of tyranny. 4 The Founders understood that where war is necessary to protect our liberties and inde- pendence, it must be fought, won — and ended. As Madison warned, neither liberty nor prosperity can survive a state of perpetual war. Gateway to Perpetual War In the wake of 9-11, most Americans understood that a mili- tary response of some type, against some foreign enemy, was inevitable. Of course, more than a few wondered why, in light of the hundreds of billions of dollars spent each year on \"de- fense,\" our federal government was unable to prevent the lethal terrorist strike against our most prominent cities by 19 knife- wielding fanatics.

Had President Bush asked for a declaration of war against Afghanistan, he almost certainly would have received one from Congress. But Congress chose instead to issue an open-ended resolution approving the use of force against any nation or foreign power the president adjudged to be in league with terrorists. This resolution — along with various UN Se- curity Council resolutions — was used to justify the invasion and occupation of Afghanistan. 5 A similar formula was followed when, in March 2003, the Bush administration invaded and occupied Iraq: Again, the president invoked various UN Security Council resolutions and a congressional resolution supposedly authorizing the presi- dent to enforce them. 6 The Bush administration insist ed that Iraq posed an imme- diate threat to our nation. By the end of 2003, it was clear that it never did — a conclusion confirmed beyond dispute by the congressional testimony of chief U.S. arms inspector David Kay in early 2004. Shortly before the war began, a national opinion poll revealed that a ma jority of the American public believed that Saddam Hussein had been involved in the 9-11 attacks. By late 2003, however, administration officials from the president on down admitted that it had no evidence of an Iraqi role in 9-11, or of signi ficant ties with the al-Qaeda ter- rorist network blamed for the atrocity. Immediately before the war began, the administration abruptly changed the party line again: Now the war was to serve the humane purpose of liberating Iraqis from the grip of the despotic Saddam Hussein — a tyrant whose regime had prospered as a client of both Washington and Moscow. 7 Prac- tically on the eve of the war, President Bush made a public ad- dress in which he described the impending conflict as the opening phase of a regional \"democratic\" revolution in the Middle East — a concept that he eventually expanded into a global \"democratic revolution.\" 8 "},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"128 America's Engineered Decline In a November 2003 speech in London's Whitehall Palace, Mr. Bush insisted that \"we now have only two options [in Iraq]: to keep our word, or to break our word.

Yet democracy will succeed in Iraq, because our will is firm, our word is good, and the Iraqi people will not surrender their free- dom.\" Keeping our \"word,\" he explained, would also mean paying additional billions of dollars in foreign aid, interven- ing elsewhere in order to promote the global \"democratic rev- olution,\" and working to bolster the credibility of the United Nations as \"an effective instru ment of our collective securi- ty.... [T]he credibility of the UN depends on a willingness to keep its word and to act when action is required.\" Indeed, admitted Mr. Bush, the chief purpose of the war in Iraq is to \"prevent the United Nations from solemnly choos- ing its own irrelevance and inviting the fate of the League of Nations.\" This was the central point of the president's address — which was captured in the headline chosen for the London Guardian's story about the speech: \"Iraq war saved the UN, says president.\" War for the \"Core\" The Iraq war left the United States with roughly half of our military entrenched in the Middle East. According to Thomas P.M. Barnett, a Pentagon \"futurist\" and key adviser to Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, entangling our military in the re- gion is actually the most important achievement of the war. \"When the United States finally goes to war again in the Persian Gulf,\" wrote Barnett shor tly before the war began, \"it will not constitute a settling of old scores, or just an enforced disarmament of illegal weapons, or a distraction in the war on terror. Our next war in the Gulf will mark a historical tipping point — the moment when Washington takes real ownership of strategic security in the age of globalization. This is why"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"The Wages of Perpetual War 129 the public debate about this war has been so important: It forces Americans to come to terms with ... the new security paradigm that shapes this age, namely, Disconnectedness de- fines danger. Saddam Hussein's outlaw regime is dangerously disconnected from the globalizing world, from its rule sets, its norms, and all the ties that bind countries together in mutually assured dependence.\" 9 In the aftermath of 9-11, Barnett, a professor of warfare analysis at the U.S. Naval Wa r College, repeatedly offered a standard briefing to high-level military officials and policy- makers at the Pentagon. That briefing focused on a division of the world between the \"Functioning Core\" — nations that had been assimilated into the global system of \"collective securi- ty\" and managed trade — and the \"Non-Integrating Gap\" — nations yet to be assimilated. A small number of nations were designated \"seam states\" along the border between the Core and the Gap. The operative security principle in the global age, pontifi- cated Barnett, is: \"A country's potential to warrant a U.S. mil- itary response is inversely related to its globalization connec- tivity.... If we step back for a minute and consider the broader implications of this new global map, then U.S. national-secu- rity strategy would seem to be: 1) Increase the Core's immune system capabilities for responding to September 11-type per- turbations; 2) Work the seam st ates to firewall the Core from the Gap's worst exports, such as terror, drugs, and pandemics; and, most important, 3) Shrink the Gap.\" 10 Where does the war on Iraq fit into this picture? Barnett of- fered a revealing answer: \"The real reason I support a war like this is that the resulting long-term military commitment will finally force America to deal with the entire Gap as a strategic threat environment.\" 11 The \"Gap,\" it should be explained, is everything outside of \"North America, much of South Amer- ica, the European Un ion, Putin's Russia, Japan and Asia's emerging economies (most notably China and India), Australia"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"130 America's Engineered Decline and New Zealand, a nd South Africa....\" Taken together, \"Gap\" and \"Seam\" states account for roughly two billion people, in- cluding hundreds of millions of unemployed or under-em- ployed Third World young men — potential recruits for ter- rorist or guerrilla movements. 12 Tellingly, the single most important criterion for member- ship in the \"Core,\" according to Barnett, is a nation's mem- bership in the World Trade Organization (WTO). Citing the example of Communist China, a nation designated a member of the \"Core\" despite being ruled by \"a 'Communist party' whose ideological formula is 30 percent Marxist-Leninist and 70 percent Sopranos\" Barnett explains that WTO membership forces each member state \"to harmonize its internal rule set with that of globalization — banking, tariffs, copyright pro- tection, environmental standard s.... Trying to adapt to global- ization does not mean that bad things will never happen to you. Nor does it mean all your poor will immediately morph into stable middle class.... [I]t is al ways possible to fall off this bandwagon called globalization. And when you do, bloodshed will follow. If you are luck y, so will American troops.\" 13 Most Americans would object to the notion that America's military is intended to be a gl obal constabulary force, rather than to defend our homeland and its citizens. But as Barnett approvingly observes, since the supposed \"end of the Cold War,\" the U.S. military has been used exclusively as globo- cops. Between 1990 and 2002, the U.S. military was dis- patched on 132 separate forei gn deployments — wars, major air campaigns, occupations, and so on — all of which involved \"countries having trouble with globalization.... The discon- nected countries are where you'll find instability.

We have to fight those who would hijack societies and disconnect them from the global economy. We have to accept some emigrants from aspiring countries. But more important, we need to accept their imports and help them get on a sensible development path. 15 It's all quite simple, according to Barnett. Our tax dollars, industrial capacity, and servicemen will be sent abroad in the interest of building the global economy; developing nations will send us wave after wave of low-priced imports as well as their unemployable emigrants. As historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr. observed nearly a decade ago, \"We are not going to achieve a new world order without paying for it in blood as well as in words and mon- ey.\" 16 The toll inflicted on our nation by the war in Iraq is merely a down payment on the price of building the connected world envisioned by the Power Elite, and described in such clinical fashion by Barnett. To those whose sons, daughters, fathers, and mothers return from Iraq in shipping tubes, that price is much too high. Demolishing Saddam's ruling infrastructure was relatively easy; restoring some semblance of order afterwards proved to be a much larger challenge. Scor es of Americans died in the initial invasion.

Those Who Bear the Burden As a young man, Mike Gorski of Hayward, California served four years in the United States Marines. After mustering out of the Corps, Gorski enlisted in the National Guard — one weekend of training a month, two weeks on active duty. He then married, started a family, and began a career as a banker. Gorski and tens of thousands of other Guardsmen and Army Reservists were called to active duty following the terrorist at- tack of September 11, 2001. And like hundreds of thousands of Americans in uniform, Gorski was deployed to Iraq after the March 2003 invasion of that country — which was sold to the public as necessary to pre- empt a possible Iraqi terrorist strike on our homeland. Mike Gorski's unit, the 870th Military Police Company of the California National Guard, included \"teachers, bankers, mortgage brokers, telecommunications experts, police offi- cers, and copy machine repairmen,\" reported the New York Times. \"There is a father who has not seen his first child, one who has not seen his second and a grandfather who is raising"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"The Wages of Perpetual War 133 his grandson.\" 19 These part-time soldiers were told that their tour would last six months. As the morass deepened in Iraq, their deployment was eventually expanded to a full year — a development that prompted widespread protests from Guard and Reserve fami- lies. \"You can't rely on these occupations ... to be done by the Guard and Reserves,\" observed Florida Senator Bill Nelson. \"They have a specialized niche, a nd in times of war, that's one thing. But in times of long, lengthy occupations, you can't take them away from their employers [and their families].\" 20 Employers of Guardsmen and Reservists are required by law to hold their jobs for them while the servicemen are de- ployed abroad. However, they are not required — and should not be expected — to keep paying salaries to their absent em- ployees. Fortunately for Gorski's family, his patriotic employer continued to pay his salary, permitting his wife to make mort- gage payments and to assume a volunteer role leading a sup- port group for other families of the 870th. Within a few months Mrs. Gorski had run up an $ 11,000 credit card bill from phone calls, postage costs, care pack ages, and paying for family sup- port meetings and dinners. But many of the families Mrs. Gorski tended to were in much worse financial condition. Specialist Jory Preston, a telecommunications worker from Pleasant Hill, California, enlisted with the National Guard in January 2003 as a way to make ends meet. He and his wife married in February; a month later, with his wife expecting their first child, Jory was en route to Iraq. Preston's employer chose to stop paying his salary. As a result, his family — his wife and newborn child — lost $2,000 a month. After giving birth, Jory's wife Anita was forced to move out of the couple's apartment and move in with her father. She also succumbed to clinical depression. \"They told us when we first got deployed it would be six months — the whole thing,\" stated Preston. \"I thought I could handle that. I wasn't aware of my wife's situation and I thought"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"134 America's Engineered Decline I could suck it up and drive on, as the soldiers say.\" 21 \"Right now, it's the small things that play on the minds of the families left behind,\" stated Jeanean McKiever, who or- ganized a support group called A Family of One for spouses and children of Reservists deployed to Iraq. Apart from obvi- ous concerns over mortgage payments, medical bills, and other large expenses, families suddenly deprived of up to half of the expected household income must deal with smaller expenses that are usually taken for granted. \"What about the [Thanksgiving] turkey? How can we afford school supplies?\" Compounding the financial hardships suffered by families of Guardsmen was what Congressman Christopher Shays called \"a virtual systemic meltdown\" of the military pay system: An incredible 94 percent of mobilized National Guardsmen experienced problems receiving their pay. According to a Guardsman who served as paymaster for a unit in Afghanistan, every soldier in hi s company had \"some form of pay problem.\" One waited six weeks to get his first check; an- other had his wages improperly garnished for four months. Another spent each week making cost-prohibitive satellite tele- phone calls home \"trying to determine if he's been paid cor- rectly and making sure his family [had] enough money to pay the bills.\" 22 Those Left Behind The emotional toll of prolonged deployment, although im- possible to tabulate objectively, is just as formidable as the fi- nancial burden. \"Do these women miss their men? Believe me, they face that emotional change from the day he packs his bag and leaves,\" observed Jeanean McKiever, who was born and raised in a military family. \"Can they stay faithful for a whole year? I'm not even going there but I'll tell you that there is go- ing to be a big problem when the men do get home.\" Lengthy deployments abroad can result in other domestic complications. When Army Reservist Jamie Peters was de-"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"The Wages of Perpetual War 135 ployed to Iraq in February 2003, his daughter Laila was five months old. For months afterward, she would smile and ex- claim \"Dada!\" whenever she saw a picture of her father. By the time she was a year old, however, her typical reaction had changed: She would throw the picture down and cry, \"No!\" 23 Guardsman Eric Kinslow of Brookings, South Dakota, was in Iraq when his son Toby was born. Had his wife not been seven months pregnant, she would have been sent to Iraq as well when her Guard unit was called up. 24 The Kinslows were hardly the only two-soldier family affected by the war. Sgt. First Class Vaughn and Specialist Simone Holcomb of Col- orado Springs were both called up for service in Iraq, leaving behind seven children in the ca re of Vaughn's mother and ex- wife. 25 Simone had served in the National Guard before joining the Army. \"In an ideal world, I wanted to be a soldier and a mom,\" she recalled. It's also safe to assume that raising a family of seven children required more income than Vaughn could pro- vide alone. However, after the couple was called to serve their country abroad, Vaughn's ex-wife filed for custody of the three daughters they had prior to the divorce. After Vaughn and Simone were granted an emergency leave to contest the claim, a judge ru led that one of them must re- main behind to care for the children. It was decided that Vaughn would return to his tank platoon, and Simone — de- fying an order to return to Iraq — chose to remain behind. She was given an administrative punishment and threatened with criminal charges for going AW OL. Eventually Simone was taken off active duty and quietly returned to the Guard with- out further punishment. 26 As the Iraq conflict deepened, commentator Bill Kauffman described the increasingly co mmon spectacle of \"women re- servists, young mothers of infants and small children, leaving their families to go halfway 'round the world to act as cogs, expendable parts, in the machinery of the ... Empire.\" 27 One"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"136 America's Engineered Decline of them was Lori Piestewa, the Hopi woman from Arizona — and mother of two small children — killed in the attack that wounded Jessica Lynch. Widespread disruption of family life is an inevitable by- product of long-term foreign conflict. Notes Kauffman: \"The Second World War, by removing men from households and re- moving many of those households from the rural South into the unwelcoming urban North, waged its own mini-war upon the American family. Rosie the Riveter propaganda aside, the domestic face of the warfare st ate was sketched by an Arkansas social worker: 'Child ren's fathers go off to war and their moth- ers go to work, and thus the interests of parents is diverted from the home and the children.' \" 28 One significant difference be tween World War II and the open-ended \"war on terrorism\" is that too frequently both the father and the mother are sent off to war. Not surprisingly, all of these problems have led to collaps- ing morale and severe attrition in terms of recruitment and re- tention of Guardsmen and Reservists. \"Retention is what I am most worried about,\" admitted Lt. General James Helmly, head of the Army Reserve. \"This is the first extended-duration war the country has fought with an all-volunteer force.\" Although historically the Guard and Reserve were designed to be de- ployed rapidly and then brought home immediately, they have now entered what Lt. Gen. Helmly calls a \"brave new world\" of lengthy, dangerous deployments abroad. This could result in Reservists being deployed for 15 months or more at a stretch. 29 The National Guard was originally intended to serve as each state's \"select militia.\" In the post-September 11 envi- ronment, however, both the regular Army and the National Guard are being transformed into a \"nation-building force\" ready for rapid deployment anywhere in the world on short notice. And foreign deployments of a year or more will \"likely become the norm.\" 30 This assumes, of course, that the"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"The Wages of Perpetual War 137 Guard and Reserves will be able to attract and keep skilled personnel. \"People are dropping out left and right,\" commented an of- ficer in the Army Reserve fro m Milwaukee. National Guard Association spokesman John Goh een admitted that \"there is some concern over current oper ations tempo.... How much is too much? How much will it impact recruiting?\" 31 Perpetual War vs. Prosperity As James Madison warned, liberty and prosperity cannot long endure \"in the midst of continual warfare.\" War is the single greatest stimulant to government growth; it devours wealth, destroys capital, sows lasting enmities, and deprives society of its bravest and most capable men. It is occasionally a nec- essary evil, but it is no less evil when it proves to be necessary. Even when fought for the right reasons, war is a plague. When inflicted on a population for the wrong reasons, it is a singular crime. In order to create the centrally directed global economy de- scribed by Barnett, our nation must assume the sorrowful bur- dens of empire until — deprived of our liberties, stripped of our prosperity, and bloodied by endless foreign conflicts — our depleted nation surrenders its independence to the global government our rulers are assembling even now."},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"Endnotes C HAPTER O NE — Race to the Bottom 1.

In a PBS interview, Jones explained: \"Kinsey [was] at odds with the way society regulates human sexual behavior, and what he [wanted] to see is a much more encompassing ethic of tolerance that will make room at the tabl e for lots of different kinds of people who don't fit under the cookie cutters of prescribed morality.\" He also admits that Kinsey's \"desire to change how people view human sexual behavi or,\" which was \"so embedded in his being,\" led him to conclude that \"if the information is pre- sented with the right complexion then it will allow only one set of conclusions, which is in the di rection of social tolerance.... What Kinsey did, I think, was to make behavior that seemed very marginal but aberrant in a moral lexicon much more com- mon and much more approachable to people because he says it represents X amount of the population.\" He also has described Kinsey's \"homo-erotic interest.... [He was] attracted to members of the same sex sexually, and beginning certainly by the late 1930s, he is beginning to try to explore and act upon his private needs.\" This was a reluctant and grudging validation of the charge that Kinsey's \"research\" was done in the service of his own personal and revolutionary agenda.
