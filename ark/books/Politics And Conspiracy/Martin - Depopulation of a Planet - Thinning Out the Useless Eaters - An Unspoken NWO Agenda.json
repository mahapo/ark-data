There are frequent references to \"useless eaters\", which includes the bulk of m ankind. Most, wh en hearing of plots to depopulate the planet, simply say under their breath, \"Yeah, ri ght,\" or m ore often, while shaking their head, \"You' re nuts.\" But when there is a careful exam ination of writings by prom inent authors of this century, p ieces of the pu zzle certain ly do fall into place - pieces which su pport th e co ntention that there ar e cer tain ind ividua ls, if not entire governm ents, who have im plem ented a program of global genocide in an effort to salvage and corner \"resources\". What you will b e read ing in this series on Depopulation Of A Planet are selected writings from a wide cross-section of viewpoints and political leanings . I will be using \"their\" own docum ents, their own words, to weave a fabric which, in th e end, will b e a tapestry of undeniable clarity for those with eyes to see. Without the historical foundation upon wh ich to base understanding, writing about current efforts at depopulation, through the use of viru ses and m icroorganism s, would have far less significance. So please stay with it as you read and it will come t ogether. I realize that som e of this initial m aterial m ay seem dry, but it is im por tant for a broader understa nding of this critical and tim ely issue. THOMAS MALTHUS Thom as Robert Malthus was a parson of the E nglish State Church and an econom ist who lived from 1766-1834. He is best known for his writing An Essay On The Principle Of Pop ulation , published in 1798. His m ain idea is that populations increase m ore rapidly than food supplies. So, he claim ed, there would always be m ore people in the world than can be fed, and wars and disease w ill be necessar y to kill o ff the extra po pulation . Malthus did not claim to be the originator of th is idea, although it has come to be known as the \"Malthusian Theory\". Malthus based his ar gum ent on the works of Condorcet, David Hum e, Adam Sm ith, Defoe, Sir Jam es Steuar t, Townsend, Franklin, and others. Malthus' Essay suggested to Charles Darwin the relati onship between progress and the survival of the f ittes t. This was th e basic idea in Darwin' s theory of ev olution. GEORG W ILHELM HEGEL Turning to the New Ame rican Encyclopedia , we read, \"Georg W ilhel m Friedrich Hegel (1770- 1831), German philosopher of idealism who had an imm ense influence on 19th and 20th-century thought and history.

Hegel found this m ethod both in the workings of the m ind, as a logical procedure, and in the workings of the history of the world, which to Hegel was the process of the developm ent and realization of the World Spirit (Weltge ist) . Hegel’s chief works were Phenomenology of the Mind (1807) and Philosophy Of Right (1821). His most im portant follower was Marx.\" In the book edited by Carl J. Friedrich entitled The Philosophy of Hegel , Hegel writes in The Philosophy of History , \"In the Chr istian re lig ion God has revealed Him self, giving to m en the knowledge of what He is so that He is no longe r secluded and secret. W ith this possibility of knowing Him, God has imposed upon us the duty to so know Hi m. The developm ent of the thinking spirit, which has started from this basis, from the revelation of th e Divine Being, m ust at last p rogres s to the po int where what was at first presented to the spirit in feeling and im agination is com prehended by thought. W hether the tim e has com e to achieve this knowledge depends upon whether the final end of the world ha s at last e ntered into a ctual rea lity in a generally valid and conscious m anner.\" Hegel concludes with, \"World histor y, with all the changing dram a of its histor ies, is th is proce ss of the developm ent and realization of the spirit. It is the true theodicy, the justif ication of God in history. Only this insight can r econcile the spir it with world h istory and the actual reality, that what has happened, and is happeni ng every day, is not only not ' without God' , but is essentially the work of God.\" In his work A History Of Western Philosophy , Bertrand Russ ell writes, \"T hroughout the whole period after the death of Hegel, m ost academ ic philosophy rem ained traditional, and therefore not very im portan t. Britis h em piricist philosophy was dom inant in Englan d until n ear the end of the cen tury, and in France until a so mewhat ear lier tim e; then, gradua lly, Kant and Hegel conquered the universities of France and England, so far as their teachers of technical philosophy were concerned.\" Russell con tinues, \"[ Condorcet 1743-1794]...was also th e inventor of Malthus' s theory of population, which, however, had not for him the gl oom y consequences that it had for Malthus, because he coupled it with the necessity of birt h control. Malthus' s father was a discip le of Condorcet, and it was in this way that Malthus cam e to know of the theory.\" Of Hegel, Russell writes in part, \"Hegel does no t m ean only that, in som e situations, a nation cannot rightly avoid going to war. He m eans m uch more than this. He is opposed to the creation of institu tio ns - such as a world gov ernm ent - wh ich would prevent su ch situations from arising, because he thinks it is a good thing that there sho uld be wars from tim e to tim e. W ar, he [Hegel] says is the condition in which we take seriously the vanity of tem poral goods and things.

Their system gave birth to two others, of more im porta nce than itse lf, nam ely Darwinism and Socialism . Darwinism was an appl ication to the whole of anim al and vegetable life of Malthus' s theory of population, which was an integral part of the politics and econom ics of the Bentham ites - a global free com petition, in which victo ry went to th e anim als th at m ost resem bled successful capitalists. Darwin himself was influenced by Malthus, and was in general sym pathy with the Philosophical Radicals. There was, however, a gr eat d ifference between the com petition adm ired by orthodox econom ists and the struggle for existence which Darwin proc laim ed as th e m otive force of evolution. ' Free com petition, ' in ort hodox econom ics, is a very artificial con ception, hedged in by legal restrictions. You m ay underse ll a com petitor, but you must not m urder him . You m ust not use the arm ed for ces of the State to help you to get the better of foreign manufacturers. Those who have not the good fortune to possess capit al must not seek to im prove their lot by revolution. ' Free com petition,' as understood by the Bentham ites, was by no m eans really free. \"Darwinian com petition was not of this lim ited s ort; ther e were no rules a gainst h ittin g below the belt. The fram ework of l aw does not exist am ong an im als, nor is war exclu ded as a co mpetitiv e method. The use of the State to secu re victo ry in com petition was against the ru les as conceived by the Bentham ites, but could not be excluded from the Darwinian struggle. In fact, though Darwin himself was a liberal, and though Nietzs che never m entioned him except with contem pt, Darwin's Surviva l Of The Fittest led, when thoroughly assim ilate d, to som ething m uch m ore like Nietzsche' s philosophy than like Bentham' s. Th ese developm ents, however, belong to a later period, since Darwin' s Origin Of Species was published in 1859, and its political im plications were not at first perceived.\" KARL MARX In his 1843 writing from The Kreuzn ach Manuscripts : Critique Of Hegel's Philosophy Of Right [from Discussion Of The Princely P ower, Co mm ents On Hegel' s 279] Karl Marx writes, [quoting:] \"Dem ocracy is the truth of m onarchy; m onarc hy is not the truth of de mocracy. Monarchy is forced to be dem ocracy as a non sequitur within itself, whereas the m onarchical m oment is not a non sequitur within dem ocracy. Democracy can be understood in its own term s; m ona rchy cannot. In dem ocracy, none of its mom ents acqui res a m eaning other than that which is appropriate to it. Each is actua lly only a m oment within the whole dem os. In m onarchy, a part determ ines the character of the whole. The whol e constitution has to take shape of this firm foundation. De mocracy is the type or species of the constitution. Monarchy is a variety, and indeed a bad variety. Democracy is ' form and content' . Monarchy is supposed to be only form , but it f alsif ies the con tent. \"In m onarchy, the whole, the people, is subsum ed under one of its particular m odes of existence, that of the p olitical cons titu tion. In d emocracy, on the other h and, the con stitu tion its elf appears as only one determ ination, and indeed, as the self-det erm ination of the people. In m onarchy, we have the peo ple of the co nstitu tion ; in dem ocracy we have the constitution of the people. Dem ocracy is the riddle of all constitutions so lve d.

The constitu tion is seen as what it is, the freel y-created product of m an. One could say that in som e respects this is also tru e of constitu tio nal m onarchy, but what specifically d ifferentiates dem ocracy is the fact that in dem ocracy the constitu tion is only one particular m oment in the existence of the people, that the political con stitu tion does not itself constitute the state. \"Hegel beg ins with the s tate a nd turns m an into the state subjec tiv ized ; de mocrac y begins with man and m akes the state into m an objectivized. Just as religion does not create m an but m an creates relig ion, so the constitu tion d oes not create the peop le but the peop le create the constitution. In certain respects, dem ocracy bears the sam e relation to all o ther form s of state as Christianity bears to all other re ligio ns. Christian ity is re ligio n par excellence , the ess ence of relig ion , m an deified as a particular religion. Sim ilarly, democracy is the essence of every constitution; it is socialized man as a particular co nstitu tion. D emocracy is related to o ther constitutions as a spec ies is re lated to its va rie ties. But in democracy the s pecies its elf appears as a particular [for m of] existence, as on e th erefore that appea rs as a particu lar type vis -a-vis other particular [individual] existen ces that do not correspond to thei r essence. De mocracy is the Old Testament in rela tion to all o ther f orms of state. Man does n ot exis t for the law, but the law exis ts for m an. In dem ocracy law is the ex istence of man, while in other form s of state m an is the existence of law. This is the fundam ental distinguishing m ark of de mocracy.\" Marx concludes with, \"In all st ates other than d emocracy the state , the law , the constitution is dom inant without actually dom inating, i.e., with out penetrating m ateria lly the content of the rem aining non-political spheres: in dem ocracy the constitution, the law, the state itself as a politica l con stitu tion is o nly a se lf-de term ination of the people, a par ticu lar content of theirs. \"It is self-evident, incidentall y, that all form s of s tate have democracy as their truth, and are therefore untrue in so far as they are not dem ocratic.\" In a correspondence of 1843, which was an exch ange of letters between Marx, Ruge, and Bakunin concerning the prospects of social and political em ancipation, Marx writes, \"Man' s self-esteem , freedom , m ust be awakened on ce m ore in the hea rt o f these m en. Only this feeling, which disappeared from the world with th e Greeks and vanished in to the blue m ists of heaven with Christianity, can once more transfor m society into a fellowship of m en working for their highest purposes, a dem ocratic state. \"Those people, on the other hand, who do not feel them selves to be m en becom e appendages of their m asters, like a herd of slav es or horses.

A Ger man Aristotle, w ho would take his Politics from our conditions, would write on the first page: ' Man is a social, but a com pletely apolitica l, anim al’.\" Further on, Marx continues, \"To be sure, in tim es when the political s tate as such is born, violently, ou t of civil society, when men strive to liberate th em selves under the form of political self-liber atio n, the state can and must go on to abolish and destroy religion. But it does so only the way that it abolishes private property, by setting a m axim um, providing for conf iscation and progressive tax ation, just as it abolished lif e by establishing the gu illotine. In mom ents when polit ical life has a specially strong feeling for its own im por tance, it seeks to re press its presuppo sition s, civ il society and its elem ents, and to constitu te itself as th e rea l, harm onious species-life of m an. It can do this only by entering into vio lent contradiction with its own conditions of existence; it can do so only by declaring the revolution to be permanent; and the political dram a ther efore necessarily ends with the restoration of religion, of priv ate property, and of all the elem ents of civil society, just as war ends with peace... \"W e have shown, then, that political em ancipation from religion leaves religion standing, even if not as privileged religion. The contradiction in which the follower of a specific religion finds him self in relation to his citizenship is only one aspect of the universal secular contradiction between the political state and civil society . The consumm ation of the Christian state is a state that recognizes itself as stat e and abstracts itself from the religion of its mem bers. The em ancipation of the state from religion is not the em ancipation of actual m an from religion.\" In Capital , Marx writes, (quoting:) T he laboring populat ion therefore produces, along with the accum ulatio n of capital produced by it, th e m eans by which itself is m ade relatively superfluous, is turned into a relative surplus-population; and it does this to an always increasing extent. This is the law of population peculiar to the capitalist mode of productio n; and in fact every specific historic m ode of production has its own specific la ws of population, historic ally valid within its lim its alone. An abstract law of population exists for plants and anim als only, and only insofar as man has not interfered with them . [end quoting] Bertrand Ru ssell wr ites in A History Of Western Philosophy , \"Marx' s philosophy of history is a blend of Hegel and British econom ics. Like Hegel, he thinks that the world develops according to a dialectical form ula, but he totally disagree s with Hegel a s to the m otive f orce of this developm ent. Hegel believed in a m ystical en tity called Spirit , which causes hum an history to develop according to the stages of th e dialectic as set forth in Hegel' s Log ic . W hy Spirit has to go through these stages is not clear. One is tem pted to suppose that Spirit is trying to understand Hegel, and at each stage rashly ob jectifies what it has been reading.

In the m idst of the riches which their labour piles up for you, their m isery rises up too and stifles you. You withdraw in disgust to the other end of the town from the m; you appoint special carriages on your railways and special se ats in your churches and theaters for them ; you set your life apart from theirs by every class barrier you can devi se; and yet they swarm about you still: yo ur face gets stam ped with your habitual loathing and suspicio n of them : your ears g et so filled with the langu age of the vilest of them that you break into it when you lose y our self- control: they poison your life as rem orselessly as you have sa crificed theirs heartlessly.

Governm ent by clubs and firing squads, by artificial fam ine, mass im prisonm ent and mass deportation, is not merely inhum ane (nobody cares m uch about that now adays); it is dem onstrab ly inefficient and in an age of advanced technology, inef ficiency is the sin against the Holy Ghost. A really efficient totalitarian state would be one in which the all- powerful executive of pol itical bosses and their arm y of m anagers control a popul ation of slaves who do not have to be coerced, because they love their servitude. To m ake the m love it is the task assigned, in present- day to talita rian s tates, to m inistries of propaganda, newspaper editors and school teachers. But their m ethods are still crude and unscientific. The old Je suits' boast th at, if they wer e given the schooling of the child, they could answer for the m an's religious opinions, was a produc t of wishful thinking. And the modern pedagogue is probably rather less efficient at conditioning his pupils' reflexes than were the rev erend fathers who educated V oltaire. Th e greatest triumphs of propaganda have been accom plished, not by doing som ething, but by refrai ning from doing. Great is truth, bu t still greater, from a practical point of view, is silence about truth. By sim ply not m entioning certain subjects, by lowering what Mr. C hurchill calls an \"iron cu rtain\" between the m asses and such facts or argum ents as the local political bosses regard as undesira ble, totalitarian propagandists have influenced opinion much m ore effectively than they could have done by the m ost eloquent denunciatio ns, the m ost com pelling of logical re buttals. But silen ce is no t enough. If persecu tion, liquid ation a nd the othe r sym ptom s of social f riction are to b e avoided, th e positiv e sid es of propaganda must be m ade as effective as the ne gative. The m ost im portant Manhattan Projects of the future will be vast governm ent-sponsored enquiries into what th e politicians and the participa ting scien tists will call \"th e problem of happiness \" - in othe r words, the p roblem of making people love their servitude. W ithout ec onom ic security, the love of servitude cannot possibly com e into existence; for the sake of brevity, I assu me that the all-powerful executive and its m anagers will succeed in so lving the pr oblem of per manent secu rity. But security tends very quickly to be taken for gran ted. Its achievem ent is m erely a superficial, external revolution. The love of servitude cannot be established except as the result of a deep, personal revolution in hum an m inds and bodies. To bring about that re volution we require, am ong others, the following discoveries and inventions. Firs t, a greatly im proved technique of suggestion - through infant conditioning and, later, with th e aid of drugs, such as scopolam ine. Second, a fully developed science of hum an differences, enabling governm ent m anagers to assign any given individual to his or her proper place in the social and economic hierarchy.

Third (since reality, how ever utop ian, is som ething from whic h people feel the need of taking pretty frequent holidays), a substitute for alcohol and the other narcotics, som ething at once less harmful and more pleasure-giving than gin or hero in. And fourth (but this would be a long-term project, which it would take generations of to talitarian control to bring to a successful conclusion) a foolproof system of eugenics, designed to standard ize the hum an product and so to facilitate the task of the m anagers. In Brave New World th is standard iza tion of the hum an product has been pushed to fantas tic, though not perhaps im possibl e, extrem es.

[Let me remind you th is was written in 1946. ] Th ere are already certain A merican cities in which the num ber of divorces is equal to the num ber of m arriages. In a few years, no doubt, m arriage licenses will be sold like dog licenses, good for a period of twelve m onths, with no law against changing dogs or keeping m ore than one anim al at a tim e. As political and econom ic fr eedom dim inishes, sexual freedom tends compensatingly to increase. And the dictato r (un less he needs cannon fodder and fam ilies with which to colon ize em pty or conquered territo ries) will do well to encourage that freedom. In conjunction with the freedom to daydream under the influence of dope and movies and the radio, it will help to reconcile his subj ects to the servitude which is their f ate. \"All things considered it looks as though Utopia were far closer to us than anyone, only fifteen years ago, could have im agined.

The First m an was a hypocrite and a coward, qualities which have not failed yet in his line; it is the foundation upon which all civilizations have been built.\" In a lecture titled The Population Explosion , delivered at Santa Barb ara, California. in 1959, Aldous Huxley said, \"Today I want to pass on to what is happening to the hum an species and to think a little about what our ph ilosophy and our ethical outlook on the subject should be. This lectu re is ess entially abo ut hum an numbers a nd their relation to hum an well-being and hum an values in general. \"Needless to say, any accurate es tim ation of hum an num bers is very recent, but we can extrapolate into the past and com e to what s eem to be fairly good conclusions. Although there are som e fairly wide m argins of diffe rence am ong the experts, the num bers they com e to are roughly in agreem ent. They agree that in pre- agricultural days, for exam ple in the low er Palaeolithic tim es, when m an was a food-gatherin g creature, there were probably not more than twenty m illion hum ans on this whole planet. In la ter Palaeolithic tim es, after org anized hunting had been invented, the num ber probably doubled . W e can m ake a rough estim ate of what an organized h unting peop le could do b ecause we know how many Indians were presen t in North Am erica when the white m an arrived - not m ore than one m illion in th e en tire North Am erican continen t ea st of the Roc kies - and this gives one an indication of the extrem ely low density of population possible in a hunting econom y. \"The Great Revolution cam e about 6000 B.C. with the invention of agriculture, and the creation of cities in the next m illennia. By ab out 1000 B.C ., after five thousand years of agricu lture, there were probab ly about one hundred m illion peop le in the world. \"By the beginning of the Christian era, this fi gure had a little more than doubled: it w as som ewhere between two hundred m illion and two hundr ed an d fifty m illio n - less than half the present population of China. The population incr eased very gradually in the following years; som etimes there were long periods of standsti ll and som etimes there were even periods of decrease, as in the years imm ediately fo llowing 1348, when the Black Death killed of f 30 percent of the population of Europe and nobody knows how much of the population of Asia. \"By the tim e the Pilgrim fathers a rrived in this country, it is es tim ated that the population of the world was about twice what it had been on the first Christmas Day - that is to say, it had doubled in sixteen hundred years, an extrem ely slow ra te of increase. But from that tim e on, from the middle of the seventeenth century, w ith the beginn ings of the industrial revolution and the first im portation of food from the newly developed lands of the New W orld, population began rising far m ore rap idly th an it had e ver risen be for e. \"By the tim e the Declaration of Independence was signed, the figure for the hum an population of the world w as probably around seven hundred milli on; it m ust have pass ed the billion m ark fairly early in the nineteenth centu ry and stood at about fourteen hundred m illion arou nd the tim e when I was born in the 1890s.

A nd the rate of increase n ow is such that it will p robably doub le again in rather less th an fifty years. \"Thus the rates of increase have been increasing along with the ab solute increase in numbers.\" [Please remember, this was written in 1959. The world's cur rent popula tion is rap idly approaching the 7 Billio n figure - th ose are not \" official\" nu mbers, however. ]......... [and 8 billion now in the year 2000 - update] Still quoting Huxley: \"Let us now ask ourselves what the practical alte rnatives are as we confront this problem of population growth. One alternative is to do nothing in particular about it a nd just let things go on as they a re, but the con sequences of that cou rse a re quite clea r: th e proble m will be so lved by nature in the way that nature always solves problem s of over-population - when any anim al population tends (a) to starve a nd (b) to suffer from severe epidem ic and epizootic diseases. \"In the hum an population, we can envisage that the natural check on the unlim ited growth of population will be p recisely th is: there will be pestilence, famine, and, s ince we are hu man beings and n ot anim als, there will be organiz ed warf are, whic h will br ing the num bers down to what the Earth can carry. W hat nature teach es us is that it is extraord inarily dangerous to upset any of its fundam ental balances, and we are in the process of upsetting a fundam ental balance in the m ost alarm ing and drastic m anner. The question is: Are w e going to rest ore the ba lance in the natural way, which is a brutal and entirely anti-h um an way, or are we going to restore it in som e inte llig ent, r ationa l, and hum ane way? If we leav e matters as they ar e, nature will cer tainly so lve the problem in her way and not in ours. \"Another alternative is to increase industrial a nd agricultural production so that they can catch up with the increase in population. This solution, however, would be ex tremely like what happens to Alice in Through The Looking Glass . You rem ember that Alice and the Red Queen are running a trem endous race. To Alice' s astonish ment, when th ey have ru n until they are com pletely out of breath they are in exactly the sam e place, and Alice says, 'W ell, in our country...you' d generally get to som ewhere else - if you ran very fast for a long tim e as we' ve been doing.' 'A slow sort of country!' says the Queen. ' Now here , you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in th e sam e place. If you want to get so mewhere else, you m ust run at least twice as fast as that!' \"This is a cosm ic parable of the extrem ely trag ic situation in which we now find ourselves. W e have to work, to put forth an enorm ous effort, just to stand where we are; and where we are is in a m ost undesirab le position because, as the m ost recen t figures issued by the United Nations indicate, so mething like two-thirds o f the hum an race now liv es on a diet of two thousand calories or less per day, which - the ideal bei ng in the neighborhood of three thousand - is definitely a diet of undernourishm ent.\" Further into the speech, quoting Huxley again: 12"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"\"The third alterna tive is to try to incr ease produ ction as m uch as possible and at the sam e time to try to re- esta blish th e balance be tween the birth rate and the d eath rate by m eans less gruesom e than thos e which are used in natu re - by intellig ent and hum ane m ethods. In this conn ection it is interesting to note that the idea of lim iting the growth of populations is by no m eans new. In a great m any prim itive so cieties, and even in m any of the high ly civ ilized s ocieties of antiquity, where local over-population was a me nace, altho ugh less fearful than the natural m eans, the m ost common wa s infanticide - killing or exposing by leaving out on the m oun tain unwanted children, or children of the wrong sex, or children who happe ned to be born with som e slight deficiency or other. Abortion was also very common. And there we re m any societies in which strict religious injunctions imposed long periods of sexual con tinence between the birth of each child. But in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries various m ethods of birth c ontrol less f earful in nature have been devised, and it is in fact theoretically conceivable that such m ethods m ight be applied throughout the whole world. \"W hat is theoretically possible, however, is of ten practically alm ost i mpossible. There are colossa l dif ficulties in th e way of implem enting any large-scale policy of lim itation of population; whereas death control is extrem ely easy under modern circum stances, birth control is extrem ely difficult. The reason is very sim ple: death control - the control, for exam ple, of infectious d iseases - can be accom plished by a handf ul of experts and qu ite a sm all lab our force of unskilled persons and requir es a ve ry sm all cap ital expenditure.\" Again, Huxley, \"The problem of control of the bi rth rate is inf initely com plex. It is not m erely a problem of medicine, in chem istry, in biochem istry, in physio logy; it is also a pr oblem in sociology, in psychology, in theology, and in education. It has to be attacked on about ten different fronts sim ultaneously if there is to be any hope of solving it.\" And, contin uing later in Huxley' s speech, \"Merely from a technical and tem poral point of view, we are obviously in a very tight spot. But we have also to consider the political point of view. There would undoubtedly have to be either world-wide agreem ent or region al ag reem ents on a general population policy in order to have any satisfactory control of the situ ation at all. But there is absolutely no prospect at the present tim e of our getting any su ch political agreem ent.\" Huxley continues, \"Now we have to ask ou rselves what our attitud e should be to wards these problem s. We com e to the other end of the brid ge. W e pass from the world of facts to the world of values. What we think abou t all this dep ends enti rely on what we regard as the end and purpose of human life. If we believe the end and purpose of hum an life is to foster power politics and nationalism , then we shall p robab ly need a g reat deal of cannon fodder, although even this p roposition b ecom es rather dubious in the light of nuclear warfare. But if, as I think m ost of us would agree, the end of hum an life is to realize individual potentialities to their lim its and in the best way possible, and to create a society which makes possible such a realization and philos ophical way about the 13"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"population p roblem . W e see that in v ery m any cases the effort to raise hu man quality is being thwarted by the m ere increase of hum an quantity, th at quality is very often incom patible with quantity.

W e have seen that the pressure of enorm ous numbers upon resources m akes it alm ost im possible to im prove the m aterial standard s of lif e, which af ter all have to r aise to a minimum if any of the higher possibilities are to be realized: although it is quite true that m an cannot live by bread alone, still less can he live without bread, a nd if we sim ply cannot provide adequate bread, we cannot provide anything else. Only when he has bread, only when his belly is full, is there som e hope of som ething el se em erging from the hum an situation. \"Then there is the politic al problem .

But when you ask whether dem ocracy is possible in a population where two-thirds of the peopl e are living on two thousand calories a day, and one-third is living on over three thousand, the an swer is no, because the people living on less than two tho usand calo ries will s imply not have e nough energ y to particip ate in the po litical life of the country, and so they will be go verned by th e well-fed and energetic. Again, quantity militates ag ainst qua lity. \" And later, \" Finally, the unlim ited in creas e in hum an numbers practically guarantees that our planetary resources will be destroyed and th at within a hundred or two hundred years an imm ensely hypertrophied hum an sp ecies will have becom e a kind of cancer on this planet and will ru in the quasi-o rgan ism on which it lives. It is a m ost depressing f orecast and pos sibility. \"I th ink one can say f rom this las t point th at the problem of quality a nd quantity is really a religious problem . For, after all, what is re ligion but a preoccupation wi th the destiny of the individu al and with the destiny of so ciety and th e race at larg e? Th is is su mmed up very clearly in the Gospel when we are told that the Kingdom of God is within us but at the sam e tim e it is our business to contribute to the founding of the Kingdom of God upon Earth.

Most religious organizations in the world today, both within an d outside the Christian pale, acc ept it. But the Rom an Catholic church does not accept any m ethod of population control except that which was prom ulgated and m ade perm issible in 1932 - the so-called rhythm m ethod. Unfortunately, where the rhythm m ethod has been tried on a consider able scale in an undeve loped country such as India, it has not been found to be very effective. The fact that the Church recognizes this problem was brought hom e very clearly in 1954 at th e tim e of the first un ited Nations Population Congress, which took p lace in Rom e, when the late Pope, in an allocu tion to the delegates, m ade it quite c lear that the pro blem of population was a very grave one which he recomm ended to the consideration of the faithful.\" 14"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"And later, \"We can conclude, th en, by saying that over-population is quite clearly one of the gravest problem s which confront us, and the choi ce before us is either to let the problem be solved by nature in the m ost horrifying possible w ay or else to find som e intelligen t and hum ane method of s olving it, simultaneously increasing production and balancing th e birth rate and the death rate, and in som e way or other for ming an agreed international policy on the subject.

POPULATION GOALS AND POLICIES Recommen dations for Action Population growth : According to the United Nations medium population projections, little change is expected to occur in average rates of population growth either in the developed or in the developing regions by 1985. According to the United Nations low variant projections, it is estim ated that as a resu lt of social and econom ic developm ent and population policies as reported by countries in the Seco nd United Nations Inqu iry on Population and Development , population growth rates in the developing countries as a whole m ay decline from the present level of 2.4 percent per annum to about 2 percent by 1985; and below 0.7 percent per annum in the 17"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"developed countries. In this case the world-wide rate of populati on growth would decline from 2 percent to about 1.7 percent. Countries w hich consider that their present or expected rates of populatio n growth hamper their goals of promoting human welfare are invited, if they have not ye t done so, to consider adopting population policies, within the fr am ework of socioeconom ic developm ent, which are consistent with basic hum an rights and national goals and values. Countries w hich aim at achieving moderate or low population growth sh ould try to achieve it through a low level of birth and death rates. Countries wishi ng to increase their rate of population growth should, when m ortality is hi gh, concentrate efforts on the reduction of mortality, an d where app ropriate, en courage an in creas e in fertility and en courage imm igration. Recognizing that per cap ita use of world resources is m uch hi gher in the developed than in the developing countries, the devel oped countries are urged to a dopt appropriate policies in population, consum ption and investm ent, bearing in m ind the need for fundam ental improvem ent in interna tio nal equity. Consisten t with the Pro clam ation of the In ternational Conference on Hum an Rights, the Declaration of Social Progress and Developm ent, the relevant targets of the Second United Nations Dev elopm ent Decade and th e other inte rnational ins trum ents on the subject, it is recomm ended that all countries: (a) Respe ct and ensure, regard less o f their ove rall dem ographic goals, the right of persons to determ ine, in a free, inform ed and responsible manner, the num ber and sp acing of thei r children; (b) Encourage appropriate education concerning responsible parenthood and m ake available to persons who so desire advice and m eans of achieving it; (c) Ensure that fam ily planning, m edical and related social services aim not only at the prevention of unwanted pregnancies but also at elim ination of involunt ary sterility and sub- fecundity in order that all couples m ay be perm itted to achieve their desired num ber of children, and that child adoption be facilitated; (d) Seek to ensure the continued poss ibility of var iations in f amily size when a low f ertility lev el has been established or is a policy objective; (e) Make use, wherever needed and appropriate, of adequately trained pr ofessional and auxiliary health personnel, rural extension, hom e econo mics and social workers, and non-governm ental channels, to help provide fa mily planning serv ices and to advise users of contraceptives; (f) Incre ase their he alth m anpower and health fa cilities to an ef fective le vel, red istrib ute functions among the different levels of professi onal and auxiliaries in order to overcom e the shortage of qualified personnel and establish an e ffective system of superv ision in their health and fa mily planning services; (g) Ensure that inform ation about, and educatio n in, fam ily planning and other m atters which affect fertility are based on valid and proven sc ientific knowledge, and in clude a full account of any risk that m ay be involved in th e use or non-use of contraceptives. It is recommended that countries wi shing to affect fertility levels give priority to im plem enting developm ent program s and educational and heal th strategies which, while contributing to 18"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"econom ic growth and higher standards of livi ng, have a decisive im pact upon dem ogr aphic trends, inclu ding f ertility .

The projections of future declin es in rates of population grow th, and those concerning increased expectation of life, are consistent with declines in the birth rate of the developing countries as a whole from the present level of 38 per thousand to 30 per thousand by 1985; in these projections, birth rates in the developed countries rem ain in the region of 15 per thousand. To achieve by 1985 these levels of fertility w ould require subs tantial nationa l efforts, by those coun tries concerned, in the field of socio-econom ic de velopm ent and population policies, supported, upon request, by adequate international ass istan ce.

The sam e consciousness which strugg led for m illions of years to ensure hum an surviva l is now on the verge of depleting its planet’s resources, rendering its environm ent uninhabitable, and fashioning the instrum ents of its ow n self-annihilation. Can th is consciousness (we) develop the wisdom not to do these things? Can we foster sufficient sel f-understanding to reduce our destructiveness, and mature rapidly enough to carry us through this ev olutionary crisis? These are surely the m ost crucial questions of our tim e, or of any tim e. Today we face a global threat of m alnutrition, overpopulation, lack of resources, pollution, a di sturbed ecology, and nuclear weapons. At the present tim e, from fifteen to twenty m illion of us die each y ear of m alnutrition and re lated causes; another six hund red m illion are chron icall y hungry an d billions liv e in poverty without adequate shelter, education, or m edical care (Brandt, 1980; P residential C omm ission on W orld Hunger, 1979). The situation is ex acerbated by an exploding p opulation th at adds ano ther billion people every thirteen years, depletes natural reso urces at an ever-accelerating rate, affects \"virtually ev ery aspect of the Earth' s ecosy stem (including) perhaps the m ost serious environm ental development ... an accelerating dete rioration and loss of th e resources essential for agricu ltu re\" (Council on Environ mental Qua lity, 1979). D esertificatio n, pollution, acid rain, and greenhouse warm ing are am ong the m ore obvious effects. Overshadowing all this hangs the nuclear threat, the equivalent of som e twenty billion tons of TNT (enough to fill a freight train fo ur m illion m iles long), controlled by hair-trigger warning system s, and creating hig hly rad ioactive wastes for which no p erm anent storage sites e xist, consum ing over $660 billion each year in m ilitary expenditu re, and threatening global suicid e (Schell, 1982; Sivard, 1983; W alsh, 1984). By way of com parison, the total am ount of TNT dropped in World W ar II was only three m illion tons (less th an a sing le large nuclear warhead). The Presidential Commi ssion on W orld Hunger (1979) estimated that $6 billion per year, or som e four days' worth of m ilitary ex penditu res could erad icate world s tarvation. W hile not denying the role of political, econom ic, and m ilitary forces in our society, the cru cial fact abou t these global crises is that all of them have ps ychological origins. Our own behavior has created these threats, and, thus, psychological appro aches m ay be essentia l to understanding and reversing them . And to the exte nt that thes e threats are dete rm ined by psychological forces within us an d between u s, they are actually symptom s - symptom s for our individual and collective state of m ind. These global sym ptom s reflect and e xpress the faulty beliefs and perceptions, fears and fantasies, defenses and de nials, that shape and mis-shape our individual and collective behavio r.

They took serum from the Trinidadian and injected it into m onkeys. From the monkeys they rem oved infected plasma, into which they dropped m osquito larvae. The infected m osquitoes were then encou raged to bite laboratory m ice and pa ss on the dis ease. This ingenious technique of public he alth resea rch in reverse work ed. The m ice duly contracted yellow fever. Laboratories were built at Fort Detrick where colonies of the aedes aegypti m osquitoes were fed on a diet of syrup and blood. They laid their e ggs on m oist paper towels . The eggs would later turn in to la rvae, and eve ntually into a ne w generation of m osquitoes. The Fort Detrick labora tories could produ ce half a m illion m osquitoes a m onth, and by the late f ifties a plan had been drawn up for a plan t to produ ce one hundred and thirty m illion m osquitoes a m onth. Once the m osquitoes had been infected w ith yellow fever, the Chem ical Corps planned to fire them at an enem y fr om \"cluster bom bs\" dropped from aircraft and from the warhead of the \"Sergeant\" missile. To test the f easib ility of this ex trao rdinary weapon, the arm y needed to know whether the mosquitoes could be relied upon to bite people. During 1956 they carried out a series of tests in which uninfected fem ale m osquitoes were released first into a residential area of Savannah, Georgia, and then dropped from an aircraft over a Florida bombing range. \"W ithin a day\", accord ing to a secret Ch em ical Corps report, \"th e m osquitoes had spread a distance o f between one and two m iles, and bitten m any people\". The effects of releasing infec ted mosquitoes can only be guessed at. Yellow fever , as the Chem ical Corps noted , is \"a highly dangerous disease\", at the very least causing high tem peratures, h eadache, and vom iting. In about a third of the record ed cas es at that tim e, yellow fever had p roved fatal. Nor were mosquitoes the only ins ects conscr ipte d into th e se rvice of the arm y. In 1956 the arm y began inves tigating the f easib ility of breeding f ifty m illion f leas a week, p resum ably to spread plague. By the end of the fifties the Fort Detric k laboratories were said to contain m osquitoes infected with yellow fever, m alaria and dengue (an acute viral disease also known as Breakbone 30"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Fever for which there is no cure); fleas infected with plague ; ticks conta minated with tula rem ia; and flies inf ected with cholera, anthrax and dysentery. [End quoting.] Further into the book A Higher Form Of Killing , we read: \"The Vietnam W ar m ight have repres ented th e perfect field laboratory for m en like General Rothschild to test their theories abou t seed ing clouds with anthrax. But there was by now sufficient evidence of the way in which Am erican and South Vietnam ese troops would also be affected to rule it out. Instead the germ warf are laboratories concentrat ed their efforts on the developm ent of incapacitating diseases which would bring an enem y down with sickness for days and weeks. For som e years the Fort Detric k laboratories had been working on enterotoxins causing food poisoning, on the m ilitary theo ry, as one propo nent put it, that \"a guy s hitting away his stom ach can' t aim a rifle at you\". By 1964, th ey believed a weapon ba sed on the theory was feasible. But by now, another disabli ng disease looked a better candidate.\" Several paragraphs later, we read: \"The results of the con tinuing research could be seen in the maps of Dugway Proving Ground in Utah, part of which were m arked \"perm anent bi o-contam inated area\", after anth rax experim ents in the m id-sixties. In the Pacif ic m ore tests we re carried out with \"hot \" age nts - th e ja rgon f or real b iolog ical weapons - on a num ber of desert ed islands. Th e results of th e tes ts are still classified on the grounds that th ey reveal weaknesses in Am erican defenses. By March 1967 Fort Detrick had developed a bact eriolog ical warhe ad f or the Serg eant m issile capable of delivering disease up to 100 m iles behind enemy lines. The Defense Departm ent had justified the accelera ting rush into biological weapons in the early sixties by saying that there was no prospect of any treaty being arrive d at which would be acceptable to the United States. Since any argum ent to ban b iological weapons was unlikely, they argued, the United States was b ound to continue her research work. \"They were wrong. In 1968 the subject of ch em ical and biological warfare cam e up for discussion at the standing Eighteen Nation Disarm ament Co mmittee in Geneva. Previous attem pts to get agreem ent on an international treaty to ban the weapons had floundered, because of an insistence that both chem ical and biologica l weapons be included in the sam e treaty. S ince gas weapons had already been used in war, been proved effective, and were stockpiled on a large scale, they would be much m ore difficult to ou tlaw than germ weapons, which as far as could satisfactorily be proved had never been used in war. The British proposed that the two subjects be separated, and introduced a draft Biologi cal Weapons Convention w hich would comm it all signatory states to renounc ing the weapons for all tim e. There was h eavy initial oppositio n from the Russians and th eir eastern E uropean allies, and little overt enthusiasm from Washingt on. The British and Canadians, who had shared their germ warfare expertise with the Am ericans, neve rtheless argued to President Nixon that an inte rnational trea ty was n ow a real po ssibility. What was needed, they said, was a gesture of goodwill. 31"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Nixon was already under pressure on the subject of che mical and biologi cal weapons, and facing mounting dom estic opposition. On 2 5 Nove mber 1969 he iss ued a statement: \"Mankind\", he said, \"already carries in its own hands too m any of the seeds of its own destruction.\" The United States was taking a step in the cause of world peace. \"The United States\", he went on, \"shall renounce the use of lethal biologi cal agents and weapons, and a ll other m ethods of biological warfare.\" It was a brave gestur e, which proved the spur for which the British had been hoping. The laborious negotiations in the P alais des Nati ons, Geneva, received a considerable boost with Nixon' s announcem ent. W ithin two years the S oviet Union had abandoned its opposition to a germ warfar e convention. On 4 April 1972 repres entatives of the two countries signed an undertaking that they would \"never in any circum stances develop, produce, stockpile, or otherwise acquire or reta in any biological weapons.\" Over ei ghty other countries followed suit. The Biological W eapons Conventio n was a triu mph, because unlike m any other arms contro l agreem ents which m erely restricted the developm ent and deploym ent of new weapons, it rem oved one category of ar maments fr om the world arsenals altogether. By the tim e agreem ent was finally signed, the re search which had begun with a sm all group of biologists pondering their contributi on to the war against Hitler ha d produced a host of diseases capable of spreading sickness throughout the wo rld. In addition to infections which would destroy wheat and rice, anthrax, yellow fever, tu larem ia, brucellosis, Q fever and Venezuelan equine enc ephalom yelitis had all bee n \"standa rdi zed\" f or use agains t m an.

[Again:] Despite the fact th at such m ajor powers as Fr ance and China h ave still (by early 1982 ) not signed it, largely because they consid er the verification procedures to be inadequate, the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention w as a m ajor achie vem ent. One of the provisions of the treaty comm itted the eighty -seven signatory countries to \"continu e negotiations on good faith\" with a view to obtaining a sim ilar agreem ent to ban chem ical weapons. The United Nations General Assem bly optim istically dubbed the 1970s \"The Disa rm ament Decade\". In the field o f che mical warfare it m ight m ore properly hav e been nam ed \"The Distru st Decade\". [Later:] In January 1978, a correspondent with Reuters' news agency reported fr om NATO he adquarters that \" scientif ic expe rts\" had inf orm ed him that the Russians were developi ng \"three horrific new diseases for warfare ....

Indeed, in the summer of 1978 a story appeared suggesting that Nixon' s original decision to stop developing new chem ical and bio logical weapo ns had been th e result of work by Soviet spies. \"A ccording to US intellige nce of ficials \", said the NEW YORK TIMES , \"the Soviet Union attem pted to influence then-President Richard Nixon in 1969 to halt ch em ical and biological weapons developm ent by transm itting inform ation through dou ble agen ts working for th e Federal Bureau of Investigation.\" The paper m aintain ed that the director of the F BI, J. Edgar Hoover, had conveyed the inform ation to Nixon personally. While none of Nixon' s White House staff was able to recall having been given any infor mation about chem ical or biological weapons by FBI agents, the NEW YORK TIMES report was sufficient nonetheless to a dd to the growing disquiet over what the Russians m ight be up to. Soon there was a positive cascade of stories about S oviet preparations for germ warfa re. A Polish arm y officer claim ed to have been told that KGB specialists in biol ogical warfare had been posted to Cuba. Then in October 1979 cam e perh aps the m ost sensational alleg ation of all. The f ledglin g British ne ws m agazine Now! splashed across its front cover the headline \"Exclusive. Russia' s secret germ warfare disast er\". It reported that \"Hundreds of people are reported to have died, and thousa nds to have suffered serious inju ry as a result of an accident which took place this su mmer in a factory involv ed in the p roduction of b acteriolog ical weapons in the Siberian city of Novosibirsk\". The S oviet authorities had attem pted to hush up the acciden t, said the m agazine, but inform ation had been obtained from a \"travelle r who was in the city at the tim e\". This \"traveller\" claim ed that bodi es of the dead were deli vered to their relatives in sealed coffins. Those few who had m anaged to glim pse the bodies had described them as being \"covered in brown patches\". [And again:] In the latter half of the 1970s there em erged a group of m ilitary theo rists who believed the th reat of Russian chem ical warfare to be on e of th e great unrecognized dangers f acing the West. In incre asing ly strid ent ton es they began to argue in favor of ch em ical rearmam ent within NATO. One of the more restrained analyses of the S oviet threat was m ade by Professor John Erickson, an acknowledged authority on the Soviet Arm y. Erickson estim ated that there were eighty t housand specialists troops in the Red Ar my, commanded by Lieutenant General V.K. Pikalov, w hose battlefield job it was to decontam inate men, machines and weaponry of chem icals. Ther e were a thousand ranges where Soviet troops trained to fight on a contam inated battlefield. So viet tanks and arm ored cars were equipped with elaborate s eals and press urization sy stem s to k eep out gas. Chem ical training was taken so seriously that Soviet soldiers, he discovered, had been burned by real gas used in training. Erickson noted that the R ussians \"constantl y em phasize the likely use by the enem y - presum ably NATO - of chem ical weapons\", yet NATO, as Erickson remarked, had only a sm all num ber of such weapons. Furtherm ore, Russian training em phasized de fense not only against nerve gas, but also against blood and lung agents first developed during the First W orld W ar, and 33"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"now uni mportant in the NATO stoc kpile. Erickson d ecided that \"th e attraction of the chem ical weapon would appear to be grow ing for the Soviet Comm and\". [And, continuing later on:] The conviction was growing am ong the \"hawks\" in NATO tha t the decision to stop expanding the chem ical arsenal had given a dang erous hos tag e to fortune. In 1980 the British op ened a purpose des igned 7,000 acre ch em ical warfare \"Battle Run\" training area in the W ilts hire h ills alongside Porton Down. The US Ar my opened a speci alist chem ical training school in Alabam a. The US Che mical Corps, reduced to 2,000 in the early 1970s, was built u p to nearly 6 ,000 by 1981. In 1979 NATO comm anders played out of their biennial war gam es si mulating the outbreak of World W ar Three. Code-nam ed \" Wintex\", th e ex erci se involved only the generals, civil servants and politicians who would m ake the critical decisions about how the war should be fought. In Operations Room s in Europe and North Am erica they acted out how they would respond to an escalating in terna tiona l crisis wh ich finally pitted NAT O and Warsaw Pact against each other in open war. As hostilities intensified, som eone in NATO headquarters fed new infor mation into the war plan being flashed to the decision m akers in their concrete bunkers: the Soviet arm y had launched an attack with chem ical weapons. W hat should be the NATO response? The choice alarm ed everyone - both the sm all NATO m embers w ho disliked gas but wanted to avoid nuclear war at all costs, and the NATO nucl ear powers, where m any felt that the appropriate response was an attack with battlefield nuclear weapons, which itself ran the danger of inviting f ull scale Soviet nuclear counter-strike. The then NATO Supre me Comma nder, General Al exander Haig, soon to becom e President Reagan' s Secretary of State, to ld rep orter s in 197 8 that NATO' s ability to wage war with chem icals was \"very we ak\". \"Som etim e in the n ear f uture,\" h e said, \" this will have to be reassessed\". His successor as S uprem e Comma nder went further. \"W e ought to be able to respond with chem ical weapons,\" he said, \"and th ey ought to know we have that capacity to respond.\" T en years after Nixon' s decision to su spend the m anufacture of chem ical weapons, by the end of th e so-called Disarm ament Decade, th e advocates of che mical rearm ament included som e of the most senior f igures in th e m ilitary es tablishm ent. There was already a weapon developed to m ake up for the deficiencies the generals saw all around them . The idea w as sim ple, and, by the 1970s, som e twenty years old. [Fro m A Higher Form Of Killing , in conclusion:] Increasing cynicism about Soviet intentions had already led in the late 1970s to a m ore aggress ive s tance. Rem embering the oppositio n to chem ical weapons which had arisen during the late 1960s, and recognizing th at any new generation would need to be based in Europe, the Pentagon began discuss ions with the British. A lthough initial negotiation s with the C allagh an governm ent cam e to nothing, discussions on the possi ble basing of chem ical weapons in Britain were resum ed after the 1979 election brought Marg aret Thatcher to power. By the spring of 1980 the British Defence Secretary was p ublicly rum inating about the size and power of the Soviet 34"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"chem ical ars enal. That s umm er the British h eld a series of meeting s with their Am erican counterparts which resulted in British support for Pentagon proposals to begin producing a new generation o f gas weapons. By December 1980 the British Defence Secretary had b een finally converted to the cause of chem ical rearm ament. Even before the T2 allegations, the clim ate had changed so m uch that in 1980 the Pentagon did not include proposals for a new bi nary gas weapon plant in its request for funds for the com ing year. There was no need. W hen the budget proposa l cam e before Congress for approval, eager politicians endorsed a suggestion to write into the budget plans to begin work on a new factory capable of turning out 20,000 rounds of 155 mm binary nerve agent shells every m onth. The entire debate in both houses of Congress took less than three hours. By the tim e the T2 allegations surfaced even Ri chard Nixon, the m an who seem ed to have halted the chem ical arm s race in 1969, believed that his efforts had been in vain and that the Russians had rearm ed while the U nited States stood still. In the past governm ents have justified continuing gas and germ research by pointing to the weapon s they believe the enem y to possess. P lans for. chem ical rearm ament in the W est are already well advanced. Unless disarm ament negotiations suddenly bear fruit, the present climate of suspicion m ay provide the perfect culture in which to breed a new generation of weapons. [End quoting.] REPORT F ROM IRON MOUNT AIN In 1967, Report From Iron Mountain On The Possi bility And Desirability Of Peace was published. The report said, in part: \"As we have indicated, the preem inence of the c oncept of war as the principal organizing force in m ost societies has been insufficien tly app reciat ed. This is also true of its extensive effects throughout the m any non-m ilitary activ ities of so ciety. Thes e effects are less apparen t in com plex industrial so cieties like our own than in prim itive cu ltures, the activ ities of which can be more easily and fully comprehended.\" And also, [quoting:] Another possible surrogate for the control of potential enem ies of society is the reintroduction, in som e for m consistent with m odern technology an d political processes, of slavery. Up to now, this has been suggested only in fiction, notably in the works of Wells, Huxley, Orwell, and others engaged in the im aginative anticipation of the so ciology of the future. But the fantasies projected in Brave New World and 1984 have seem ed less and less im plau sible over the years since their publication. The trad itio nal associat ion of slavery with ancient pr e-indus trial cultures should not blind us to its adaptability to advanced for ms of s ocial organizati on, nor should its equally trad ition al incom patibility with W estern m oral and econom ic values. It is entirely pos sible that the develop ment of a sophisticated form of slavery m ay be an absolute p rerequ isite for social contro l in a world at peace. As a practical m atter, conversion of the code of m ilitary d iscip line to a euphem ized for m of enslavem ent would entail surp risingly little revision; the logical first step would be th e adoption o f som e for m of \"univers al\" m ilitary service.

Schem atically this is so, but the problem of ti ming the transitio n to a new ecological balancing device m ake the feasibility of substitution less ce rtain. It m ust be rem embered that the lim itation of war in this function is entirely eugenic. War has not been genetically progressive. But as a system of gross population control to preserve the species it cannot fairly be faulted. And, as has been pointed out, the nature of war is itself in transition. Current tren ds in warf are - the incr easing stra tegic bom bing of civilians and the gr eater m ilita ry im portance now attached to the destruction of sources of sup ply (as oppo sed to purely \"m ilitary \" bases and personnel) - strongly suggest that a tr uly qualitative im prove ment is in the m aking. Assum ing the war syste m is to continue, it is m ore than p robable th at th e regres sive ly selec tive quality of war will have been reversed, as its vi ctim s becom e more geneti cally representative of their societies. There is no question but that a un iversal requirem ent that procre ation be lim ited to the products of artificial insem ination would provide a fully ad equate substitute control for population levels. Such a reproductive system would, of course, have the added adva ntage of being susceptible of direct eugenic m anage ment. Its predictable further developm ent - conception and em bryonic growth tak ing place wholly under lab oratory c ond itions - would extend th ese contro ls to the logical conclusion. The ecological f unction of wa r under these circum stances would not only be superseded but surpas sed in effectiv eness. The indica ted inte rm ediate step - to tal control of conception with a variant of the ubiquitous \"pill\" via water supplies or certain essential foodstuffs, offset by a controlled \"antidote\" - is already und er development. There w ould appear to be no foreseeable need to revert to any of the outm oded practices referred to in the previous section (infanticide, etc.) as there m ight have been if the possib ility of trans ition to peace had arisen two generations ago. The real question here, therefore, does not concer n the viability of this war substitute, but the political problem s involved in bringing it about. It cannot be established w hile the war system is still in effect. The reason for this is simple: excess population is war m aterial. As long as any society m ust contem plate even a remote possi bility of war, it must m ainta in a m axim um supportable population, even when so doing critically aggravates an econom ic liability. This is paradoxical, in view of war' s role in reducing excess population, but it is readily understood. W ar controls the general popul ation level, but the ecological inte rest of any single society lies in maintaining its hegem ony vis-a-vis other socie ties. The obvious analogy can be seen in a free- enterp rise ec onom y. Practice s dam aging to the so ciety a s a whole - bo th co mpetitiv e an d monopolistic - are abetted by the conflicting econom ic m otives of individual capital interests. The obvious preceden t can be found in the s eem ingly irration al political d ifficulties which have blocked universal adoption of si mple birth-control m ethods. Nations desperately in need of increasing u nfavorable p roduction-co nsum ption ratio s are nev ertheless un willing to gamble their possible m ilitary requirem ents of twenty year s hence for this purpose.

We cannot sp eak definitively for all our colleagues in The Club of Rom e, for there are differences of interest, em phasis, and judgm ent among them . But, despite th e prelim inary nature of the repo rt, the lim its of som e of its data, and the inherent complexity of the world sy stem it attempts to describe, we are convinced of the im por tance of its m ain conclusions. W e belie ve that it contains a m essage of much deeper significance than a m ere com parison of di mensions , a m essage relevant to all aspects of the present hum an predicament. Although we can here express only our prelim inary views, recognizing that they stil l require a great deal of reflection and ordering, we are in agreem ent on the following points: 1. W e are co nvinced th at realiza tion of the quantitative restraints of the world environm ent and of the tragic consequences of an overshoot is essential to the initiation of new for ms of thinking that will lead to a fundam ental revision of hu man behavior and, by im plication, of the entire fabric of present-day society. It is only now that, having begun to understa nd som ething of the in teractions between dem ographic growth and econom ic growth, and having reached unprecedented levels in both, man is forced to take account of the lim ited di mensions of his planet and the ceilings to his presenc e an d activ ity on it. For th e f irst tim e, it has becom e vita l to inqu ire into the co st of unrestricted m aterial growth and to cons ider a lter native s to its continua tio n. 2. W e are further convinced that demographic pressure in the worl d has already attained such a high level, and is m oreover so unequally distribut ed, that this alone m ust com pel m ankind to seek a state of equilibr ium on our pla net. Under-populated areas s till exis t; but, considering th e world as a whole, th e critical po int in population growth is approaching, if it has not already been reached. There is of course no unique optimu m, long-term population level; rather , there are a series of balances between population levels, social and m aterial standards, personal freedom , and other elem ents m aking up the quality of life. Given the finite and dim inishing stock of non-renewable resources and the finite space of our globe, the principle m ust be generally accepted th at growing num bers of people will eventually imply a lower standard of living and a m ore com plex problem atique. On the other hand, no fundam ental human value wo uld be endangered by a leveling off of dem ographic growth. 3. W e recognize th at wo rld equ ilib rium can becom e a reality only if the lot of the so-called developing countries is substa ntially im proved, both in absolu te term s and relative to the 38"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"econom ically developed nations, and we affir m that this im provem ent can be achieved only through a global strategy. Short of a world effort, today' s already explosiv e gaps and inequalities will continue to grow larger. The outcom e can only be disaster, whether due to the se lfishness of individual countries that continue to act purely in their own interest s, or to a pow er struggle between the developing and developed nations. The world system is simply not am ple enough nor generous enough to accomm odat e m uch longer such ego centric and conflictiv e behavior by its inhabitants. The closer we co me to the mater ial lim its to the p lane t, the m ore dif ficult th is problem will be to tackle. 4. W e affir m that the global issue of developm ent is, however, so closely interlinked with other global issues that an overall st rategy must be evolved to attack all m ajor problem s, including in particular those of m an's rela tionship with his environm ent. With world population d oubling tim e a little m ore than 30 years, and decreasing, society will be hard put to m eet the needs and expectations of so m any m ore people in so short a period.

This suprem e effort is a challenge for our ge neration. It cannot be passed on to the next. The effort m ust be resolutely undert aken without delay, and significan t redirection m ust be achieved during th is d ecade.

W e have no doubt that if m ankind is to em bark on a new course, concerted international measures and joint long-term plannin g will be necessary on a scale and scope without preceden t. Such an effort calls for joint e ndeavor by all peoples, whatever their culture, econom ic system , or level of developm ent. But the m ajor responsibility must rest w ith the m ore developed nations, not becaus e they have m ore vis ion or hum anity, b ut becaus e, having prop agated the g rowth syndrom e, they are still at the fountainhead of th e progress that sustains it. As greater insights into the condition and workings of the world sy stem are developed, these nations will com e to realize that, in a world th at f undam entally needs s tability, their high plateaus of developm ent can be justified or tolerated only if they serve not as springboards to reach even higher, but as staging areas from which to organize m ore equitable distribution of wealth and incom e worldwide. 9. W e unequivocally support the contention that a brake im posed on world dem ographic and econom ic growth spirals must not lead to a fr eezing of the status quo of econom ic developm ent of the world's nations. If such a proposal were advanced by the rich nations, it would be ta ken as a final act of neocolonialism . The achievem ent of a harm onious state of global econom ic, socio, and ecological equilib rium must be a jo int ven ture b ased on jo int conviction, with benefits for all.

W e affir m finally that any deliberate atte mpt to reach a rational and en during state of equilibrium by planned m easures, rather than by chance or catastrophe, must ultim ately be founded on a basic change of values and goals at individual, nationa l, and world levels. This change is perhaps already in the air, however faintly. But our tradition, education, current activ ities, an d inte rests will m ake the tr ansf orm ation em battled and slow.

In 1974, Mankind At The Turning Point - The Second Report To The Club Of Rome was published. W ritten by Mihajlo Besarvic and Eduard Pestel , it says, in part [quoting:] Suddenly - virtually overnight when m easured on a historical scale - mankind finds itself confronted b y a m ultitude of unprecedented cr ises: the popu lation cris is, the environm ental crisis, the world food crisis, the energy crisis, the raw m aterial cr isis, to nam e just a few. New crises appear while the old ones linger on with the effects spreading to ev ery corner of the Earth until they ap pear in po int of fact as global, wo rld wide, cris es. Attem pts at solving any one of these in isolation has proven to be tem porary and at the expense of others; to ease the shortage of energy or raw materials by measur es which worsen the cond ition of the environm ent m eans, actually, to solve nothing at all. Real solution s ar e apparen tly interdep ende nt; co llec tiv ely, the whole m ultitude of crises appears to c onstitu te a single globa l cris is-synd rome of world developm ent. The intens ity of the cris is in global world developm ent and the el usiven ess of effective m easures to bring about a solution challenge prem ises that have long been m ost fundam ental in guiding the evolution of hum an society. Although these prem ises have paved the way for hum an pr ogress in the past, they have also, finally, led to the pr esent conditions.

That the po pulation m ust lev el off som e time, i.e., that population growth should stop, is the vi ew gaining universal acceptance.\" Continuing, [quoting:] Man' s dependency on Nature goes very deep indeed; his use and m isuse of resources is only part of the picture.

[End quoting.] BRIEF ON MAN'S INTERF ERE NCE I N NATURE Continuing with Mankind At A Turning Point , [quoting:] Being \"but a part of nature,\" m an has always affected and has always been affected by his environm ent. However, due to the disproportiona te increase in num bers and due to increased sophistication in m an's in tervention in natural pr ocesses, the interferen ce of m an is taking on a com pletely new dim ension with unpredictable and potentially catas trophic consequences; this is beginning to cause concern from an unsuspected source: the sc ientists who originated and developed such techn iques of interv ention. A go od exam ple is the m ost recent app eal by a group of m icro-biologists to the worl d scientific comm unity at larg e to refrain from conducting the experim ents that involved inserti ng into bacteria the genes w hich are resistant to antibiotics or the genes of viruses. [Remember, this was written in 1974. ] The potential danger to which the appeal sp ecif ically add resses itself is due to the f act tha t the b acte ria of ten used in sc ientif ic experim ents of this kind is a co mm on inhabitant in the hum an in testine. A prospect of such a resistan t bacteria escapin g and infecting the population m ust be taken into account; it implies the possibility of loosing new plagues upon th e world. The event was properly hailed by the scientists them selves as a historical landm ark of restraint to conduct experim ents purely for the sake of scientific curiosity. It represents a reversal of the cher ished tradition th at nothing should interfere with the sciences' search for tru th. Ho wever, even if the experiments in which new, resis tant bacteria are created are foolproof, there exists a real dange r in : (1 ) the po tential of using such a new technique for biologi cal warfare; (2 ) the possib ility of such experim ents being conducted outside of a properly cont rolled laboratory. A lthough the use of this less-than-a-year- old techn ique is still in the hands of experts, it w ill b e a \"h igh school pro ject within a few years.\" The solem n high-level w arnings against conduc ting such experim ents whose consequences cannot be predicted could hardly be considered as a sufficient deterrent then. But there are m any others, even if considered less spectacula r, examples of unknown and potentially harmful consequences of m an's interv ention in nature.

But to grasp the seriou sness of the food problem and to com prehend the stra in the d emand f or food will im pose on the wo rld sys tem , one does not have to loo k into th e future at a ll: the situatio n is already critica l.\" 43"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Further into the docum ent, [quoting:] Our com put er analysis, pregnant with optim ism, shows clearly that the food crisis in South Asia will worsen. In spite of all th e advanc em ents assum ed, the availab ility of fertilizer and land assum ed, the lack of intervening disaster assum ed, the protein deficit will continuously increase; by the year 2025 it will be up to 50 m illion tons annually. Su ch defi cits could never b e closed by im ports: to pay for that quantity of imports, South Asia would have to spend one third of its total econom ic output, and three tim es wh at it earns from exports. But even if South Asia had that kind of m oney, the physical problems of handling those quantit ies of food would be incredible. In one year the region w ould then have to im port 500 m illion tons of grain - twice a s much as the total tonnage of all goods now being shipped overseas from the United States. And that is assum ing that that quantity of grain would be grown for export elsewhere - 500 m illion tons, after all, is larger than the total grain production of the entire Developed World. Moreover, these quantities w ould have to be delivered every ye ar, in ever increasing am ounts, without end. In sum , it would be im possible. But what would happen if those im ports were not available? That question for ms the basis of our second, or \"tragic \", scenario . All of our optim istic assum ptions have rem ained, except that we assum e that im portation of grain will be part of th e pictu re. Th e catastroph e would start in th e early 1980s and peak around 2010: deaths relate d to the food shortage would be double the norm al death rate. Thereafter, the d eath rate will declin e, but only becau se the earlier deaths reduced the birth rate for a late r generation. Or, to put is m ore cruelly but sim ply, the people who would be having babies died when they were ba bies. The number of food-related deaths in the fifty-year period end ing in 2025 would be, in the age of 0-15 group alone, about 500 m illion children. [End quoting.] In the November 1995 newsletter Forecast Highlights , Larry Acker writes, \"W here is the wheat? Answer: Som e of the world' s wheat crop in 1995 was dam aged or destroyed by bad weather, diseases, or insects. China needs wheat due to drought that lasted from October 1994 to present. The Soviets' wheat crop shrank significantly due to drought and insects. Australia' s wheat burned up in a severe drought. C anada' s crop was dam aged by drought and the O range Blossom Midge (an insect). Much of Europe' s crop drowned out last February and the rest burned up in the drought 6 months later. Finally, Argentina' s winter crop went 120 days with no water - which all but ruined the 1995 crop. \"W ho' s left that has any wheat? Answer: the US . Even the US crop had problem s, and m uch of the Hard Red W inter wheat belt cen tered in Kansas is quite dry as th is is being written.

The Me sarov ic-P estel work will confront them with a com pelling fra me of references that can hardly be ignored, offering them at the sam e time a new, potentially powerful tool to test out the va lid ity or f utility of their views and their policies in the real w orld fram ework. [End quoting.] And, continuing, [quoting:] Results to date, however, are already very im porta nt. The authors have concentrated on several clusters of problem s which, if not squarely met, can, alone, provoke unim aginable disasters.

It w ill b e rec alled that it was Bettino Craxi who persuaded the Italian and U.S. governm ents to negotiate with the Re d Brigades kidnappers of Prime Minister Moro and General Dozier . As an aside, General Dozier is under or ders not to talk about what happened to him . Should he break th at silence, h e will no t doubt be m ade \"a horrible exam ple of\" in the manner in which Kissinger dealt with Aldo Moro , Ali Bhutto and General Zia ul Haq . (21) Take control of education in Americ a with th e inten t and purpose of utte rly and co mpletely destroying it. Much of these goals, which I fi rst enum erated in 1969, have sin ce been achieved or are well on their way to being achieved. Of sp ecial interest in the Comm ittee of 300 program is the core of their econom ic policy, which is largely based on th e teachings of Malthus, the son of an English country parson who was pushed to prom inence by the British East In dia Com pany upon which the Comm ittee of 300 is modeled. Malthus m aintained that m an's progress is tied to the Earth' s natural ability to support a given num ber of people, beyond which point Earth' s lim ited resources would rapidly be depleted. Once these na tura l resourc es h ave been co nsum ed, it will be im possible to replace them . Hence, Malthus observed, it is necessary to lim it populat ions within the boundaries of decreasing natural resources. It goes without saying that the elite will not a llow them selves to be thre ate ned by a burgeoning population of \"useless eate rs,\" hence culling m ust be pr acticed. As I have previously stated, \"culling\" is going on today, using the m ethods m andated in the Global 2000 Report . All econom ic plans of the Comm ittee meet at the cr ossroads of Malthus and Frederick Von Hayek, another doom and gloom econom ist who is spon sored by the Club of Rom e. The Austrian born Von Hayek has long been under the control of David Rockefeller , and Von Hayek theories are fairly widely accepted in the United States. According to Vo n Hayek, the United States econom ic platform must be based on (a) Urba n Black Markets; (b) Sm all Hong Kong-type industries utilizing sweat-shop labo r; (c)The Tourist Trade; (d) Free Enterprise Zones where speculators can operate unhindered and where th e drug trade can flourish; (e) End of all industrial activity and; (f) Clos e down all nuclear energy plants. Von Hayek's ideas dove-tail perfectly with those of the Club of Rom e, which is perhaps why he is so well p rom oted in rightwing circ les in th is country. The m antle of Von Hayek is being passed to a new, younger econom ist, Jeoffrey Sach s, who was sent to Poland to take up where Von Hayek lef t of f. It will be re called that the Clu b of Rom e organiz ed the Polish econ omic crisis which led to polit ical destabilization of the country. The exact sam e econom ic planning, if 49"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"one dare call it that, will be forced upon Russia, but if widespread opposition is encountered, the old price-su pport sys tem will quick ly be res tored. The Comm ittee of 300 ordered the Club of Rom e to use Polish na tionalism as a tool to destroy the Catholic Church and pave the way for Russian troops to reoccupy the country. The \" Solida rity \" move ment was a creation of the Comm ittee of 300' s Zbigniew Brzezinski, who chose the nam e for the \"trade uni on\" and selected its office holders and organizers. Solidarity is no \"labor\" move ment, although Gdansk shipyard work ers were used to launch it, but rather it was a high-profile political organi zation, created to bring forced changes in preparation for the advent of the One W orld Governm ent. Most of Solidarity' s leaders we re descendants of Bolshevik Je ws from Odessa and w ere not noted for hating Comm unism . This helps to und erstand the saturation coverage provided by the Am erican news m edia. Professor Sachs has taken the process a step further, ensuring econom ic slavery f or a Poland rec ently f reed f rom the dom ination of the USSR. Poland will now becom e the econom ic slave of the United States. All that has happened is that the m aster has changed. Brzezinsk i is the au thor of a book that should h ave been read by every Am erican interested in th e future of this country. E ntitled The T echnotronic Era , it was comm issioned by the Club of Rom e. The book is an open announcem ent of the m anner a nd m ethods to be used to control the United States in the future. It also gave notice of cloning and \"robotoids ,\" i.e., people who acted like people and who seem ed to be people, but who were not. Brzezinsk i, spe aking for the Comm ittee of 300 said the United States was m oving \"into an era unlike any of its predecessors; we are moving toward a technotronic era that could easily becom e a dict atorship.\" I reported fully on The Technotronic Era in 1981 and mentioned it in m y newsletters a num ber of tim es. Brzezinsk i went on to s ay that ou r society \"i s no w in an inform ation rev olution b ased on am usem ent focus, spectator spectacles (satura tion coverage by television of sporting events) which provide an opiate for an increasingly pur poseless m ass.\" W as Brzezinski ano ther seer and a prophet? Could he see into the future? The answ er is NO; what he wrote in his book was sim ply copied from the Comm ittee of 300' s blue print given to the Club of Rom e for execution. Isn' t it true that by 1991 we already h ave a purpos eless m ass of citizen s? We could say that 30 million unemployed and 4 m illion hom eless pe ople are a \"p urposele ss m ass,\" or at leas t the nucleus of one. In addition to religion, \"the opiate of the m asses\" which Lenin and Marx acknowledged was needed, we now have the opiates of m ass spectator sport, unbridled sexual lusts, rock music and a whole new generation of drug addi cts. Mindless sex and an epid em ic of drug usage was created to distract people from what is happening all around them . In The Technotronic Era Brzez inski talks about \"the m asses\" as if people are som e inanim ate object - which is possibly how we are viewed by the Comm ittee of 300.

The First Global Conference on the Future had th e blessing of the W hite House which held its own conference based on the transcripts of the First Global Conference forum . It was called the \"W hite House Comm ission on the 1980s\" and O FFICIALLY recomm ended the policies of the Club of Rom e \"as a guide to future U.S. policies\" and even went so far as to say that the United States economy is m oving out of the industrial ph ase. This echoed the them e of Sir Peter Vickers Hall and Zbigniew Brzezinski and provides furt her proof of the control exercised by the Comm ittee of 300 over U.S. affair s, both dom estic and foreign.

Altogether, there are approxim ately twenty-five CFR m embers who bel ong to the Am erican A ssociation for the Club of Rom e. The Club had its beginnings in April 1968, when leaders from ten different countries gathered in Rom e at the invitati on of Aurelio Peccei, a prom inent Italian industrialist with close ties to the F iat (there' s a com pany worth lookin g at) and Olivetti Corpor ations. The organization claim s to have the so lutions for world peace a nd prosperity. However, these solu tion s always seem to promote the concept of world governm ent at the expense of national sovereignty. The Club of Rom e has been charged with th e task of overseeing th e regionalization and unification of the entire world; the Club could therefore be sa id to be one step above the Bilderbergers in the on e-world hierarchy.

The Club' s findings and recomm endations are pu blished f rom tim e to tim e in spec ial, h ighly confidential reports, which are sent to the power -elite to be implem ented. On 17 Septem ber 1973 the Club released one such repor t, en titled Regionalized and Adaptive M odel of the Global World System , prepared by COR m embers Mihajl o Mesarovic and Eduard Pestel. The docum ent reveals that the Club has divided the world into ten political/econom ic regions, which it refers to as \"kingdom s\".

The psychological cam paign that I am describing, as I have said, is the work of groups within the Eastern establishm ent, that am orphous am alga m of wealth and social connections whose power resides in its control over our fi nancial system and over a large portion of our industrial sector. The principal instrum ent of this control over the Am erican econom y and money is the Federal Reserve Sys tem . The policies and the industrial se ctors, p rim arily th e m ultinational corporations, are influenced by the money cente r banks through debt financing and through the large blocks of stock controlled by the trust depart ments of the money center banks.

Indeed, even constitutions are irrelevant to the exercise of power. Liberty and tyranny are viewed as neither necessarily good nor evil, a nd certainly not a component of policy. In this point of view, the activ ities of international financial and industrial for ces should be oriented to bringing this one-w orld design - with a convergence of the Soviet and American system s as its centerpiece - into being...

[End quoting.] THE WORLD ORDER I n Eustace Mullin s' book The World Order - Our Secret Ru lers , he writes [quoting:] In 1985, as a sequel to the history of the Fe deral Reserve System, this writer published The World Order as a com pendium of addition al inf orm ation on this subje ct. I t never o ccu rred to m e to call it The New World Order becau se m y researches had traced its depredations b ack for som e five thousand years. Perhaps in response to the exposes in this volum e, the spokesm an for the Brotherhood of Death went public with their claim s fo r a \"New W orld Order\", which essentially was the Brave New World described by Aldous Huxley in his groundbreaking novel. B ehind all dem ands for this new order were the sam e imperatives, as listed by Professor Stan ley Hoffm ann , in Primacy or World Order , \"W hat will have to take place is a gradua l adaptation of the soc ial, econom ic, and political system of the United St ates to the im peratives of world order.\" As Professor Hoffmann points out, th e United States is the p rim ary target of the m issiles of the New W orld Order becau se it s till retains, how ever perv erted and disto rted, the essen tial machinery for a republic which provides for the free dom of its citizens. T he Order' s present goals were originated by Lord Castle reagh at the Congress of Vienna in 1815, when he handed over Europe to the victorious Money Power, as ex em plified by th e presence of the House of Rothschild . This was \"the balance of power\", which was never a balance of power at all, but rather a worldwide system of control to be m anipulated at the pleasure of the conspirators. Henry Kissinger has been busily reviving this program for rene wed control, as he wr ote in a think piece for Newswe ek , January 28, 1991, \"We now face ' a new bala nce of power' . Today, it translates into the notion of ' a new world order' , which wo uld em erge from a set of legal arrangem ents to be safeguard ed by collective secu rity. \" When m inions of the World Order such as Henr y Kissinger call for \"collectiv e secu rity\", what they are really seek ing is a protective order behind which th ey can saf ely carry ou t the ir depredations against all m ankind. This was very relu ctantly identifie d by P resident George Bush , after m onths of dodging questions ab out the \"new world order\" which he had publicly called for, when he finally stated it really was \"a United Nations peacekeeping force\". This took us back to the Second World W ar, which produced the United Nations . W alter M illis, in Road To War, America 1914-17 further rem oved this program to the Fi rst World W ar, when he wrote, \"The Colonel' s (Edward Mandel House) sole jus tifica tion f or prepa ring such a bath of blood for his countrym en was his hop e of establishing a new worl d order of peace and security as a result.\" Note the ca ll f or \"secur ity\": once aga in, this is th e cry of the in terna tiona l crim inals f or protec tion as they carry out their universa l work of sabotage a nd destruction. House had first laid out the program for this \"world order\" in his book, Philip Dru - Administrator , in which Dru, (House him self) becam e the guiding force b ehind the go vern ment and directed it to the goals of world order. The sam e forces set up a Second W orld Wa r, from which the United Nations em erged as the new guarantor of \"c ollec tive secu rity \". Random House Dictionary tells us that the United Nations was created in Washingt on, January 2, 1942, when twenty-s ix nations allied against the 54"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Axis , or \"fascist\" Powers. In The American Language , H.L. Mencken says that President Roosevelt c oined the ter m, \" United Nations \" in conference with Prim e Minis ter Winston Churchill at the W hite House in Decem ber of 1941, on the eve of the Pearl Harbo r attack which manipulated us into W orld W ar II. The United Nati ons b ecam e an active entity at the Dum barton Oaks conference in 1944, when Great Britain, the United States and Russia set it in m otion as a financial dictator. If the United Nations was created to fight \"f ascism \", its m ission ended in 1945, when Fascism was defeated by m ilitary force. Fascism derives its nam e from the bundle of rods which ancient Rom an officials carried into cour t to punish offenders. Thus, fascism historically m eans law and order, the rule of law, and the intent to punish crim inals. This , of course, is what the conspirators of the W orld Order wish to avoid at all costs. The Oxford English Dictionary defines F ascism as \"one of a body of Italian nationalists which was organized in 1919 to oppose Comm unism in Ita ly.\" Othe r def inition s state sim ply that the Fasc ists wer e org anized \"to f ight Bolshevism \". Thus the United Nations essentially was set up to battle against \"anti-Communists\" as exem plified by Germ any, Italy and Japan. W hen this goal was successful in 1945, the United Nations no longer had a historic m ission. Neve rtheless, it continued to function, and the Rockefellers donated the m ost expensive parcel of real estate in Manhattan for its world headquarters. It was against this back ground that the Governor of New York, Nelson Aldrich Rockefeller , addressed a m eeting at the Sheraton Park Hotel on July 26, 1968, in which he called for the creation of \"a new world order\". Rockefeller ignored th e fact that it was Adolf Hitler who had preem pted this title as \"My New Order\" for E urope. The p hrase was an attractive o ne to our po liticians, as P residen t Bus h revealed when he addressed Congress on Septem ber 11, 1990, in a speech carried nationally on television, in which he called for \"a new world ... a world quite di fferent f rom the one we have known ... a new world order.\" He continued to reite rate this dem and in subsequent addresses on television, declaring on January 29, 1991 in his annua l State of the Union a ddress, \"It is a big idea - a new world order, where diverse nations are drawn tog ether in common to achieve the universal aspirations of m ankind, pe ace and secu rity, freedo m, and the rule of law.\" He repeated this toxin on February 1, 1991 in three separa te addresses on the sam e day, in which he em phasized the new world order call. He m odestly refrained f rom pointing out that it was not a new phrase, and that it had been adopted by Congr ess in 1782 for the Great Seal of the United States, the incom plete pyram id with its oc cult ey e, and the ph rase \" Novus Ordo Seclorum \" beneath it, identif ying this nation as comm itted to \"a new world orde r\" o r a new order for the ages which apparen tly d epended upo n pyram id power f or its f ulfillm ent. This sym bol dated f rom 1776, when Ada m W eishaupt , founder of the Illum inati sect, for mulated a program rem arkably sim ilar to th at of the wor ld order conspirators today. Weishaupt called for: \"(1) Abolition of all m onarchies and all ordered governm ents; (2) Abolition of private pr operty and inheritances; (3) Abolition of patrio tism and nationalism ; (4) Abolitio n of family lif e and the institu tion of m arriage, an d the es tablishm ent of comm unal education for children ; (5) Abolition of all religion.\" 55"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"It was hard ly acciden tal that the Rothchilds, when they hired Karl Marx and the Leag ue of Just Men to formulate a program , received the Communist Man ifes to of 1848, which contained the above form ula.

[Quoting:] Five m en rule the world. This Council of Five consists of Baron Guy de Rothschild, Evelyn de Rothschild, George Pratt Shultz, Robert Roosa (from Bush' s fam ily fir m of Brown Brothers Harrim an ) and one vacancy, at this writing. In the pa st several years, m embers of the Council who have died include Averill Harr im an, Lord Victor Rothschild, and Prince Thurn und Taxis of Regensburg, Germ any. None of them holds public office, but they choose who shall hold office in the nation s. These five m en com prise the ap ex of the pyramid of power, the W orld Order. W e may ask, Why should there be a W orld Order? Is it not sufficient to hold absolute power in a single n atio n, or in a group of natio ns? The answer is NO, because of th e nature of international trave l, in tern ationa l trade , and inte rna tiona l finance. Internatio nal travel requires that a person may travel in peace fro m one natio n to anothe r, without being m olested. Excepting cases of anarchy, revolution or war, this requirem ent can us ually be met. International trade requires that traders of one nation can go to a nother nation, transact their busine ss, and return with their goods or their profits. This requirem ent too is usua lly m et. If not, the offended nation can exercise military f orce, as Grea t Brita in did in its Opium Wars . It is the thir d requir ement, interna tio nal f inan ce, which called into being the W orld Order. In earlier d ays, when intern ational tr ade consisted of barter, paym ent in gold or silver or piracy, the seizure of goods by force, there was no need fo r a world arbiter to determ ine the value of instrum ents of trade. Th e developm ent of pa per money, stocks, bonds, acceptan ces and other negotiable instrum ents necessitated a power, able to exercise influence anywhere in the world, to declare that a piece of paper rep resen ted one billi on dolla rs in real wealth, or even one dollar in real wealth. An entry on a com puter, flashed from London to New York, states that som eone owes five billion do llars to som eone else. W ithout genuine po wer banking , no such su m could ever be collected, regardless of th e factuality or morality of the debt. As anyone in the Mafia can 56"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"tell you, you don' t collect unless you are willing to break legs. The W orld Order is always prepared to break legs, and break th em they do, by the m illion s. What would have happened to the ea rliest s ettler s in Am erica if th ey had gone to the Indians and said, \"Give us your goo ds and the d eeds to your ho mes and lands. In retu rn, we will g ive you th is beautifully printed piece of paper.\" The Indian s w ould, and did, attack them. If the settlers arrived with an arm y led by a Pizaro or a Cortes , they took the lands wi thout a piece of paper. The W orld Order rules with its pieces of paper, but behind every paper is a force which can be em ployed anywhere in the world. The force m ay be disguised by various subterfuges as international agreem ent, association s or ot her camouflage, but its ba se is always force. The W orld Order rules through a simp le technique, Divide and Conquer ( Divid e et impera ). Every natural or unnatural division among people, every occasion for hatred or greed, is exploited an d exacerb ated to the lim it. The polariza tion of racial and ethnic groups in the U.S. is accelerated by a flood of governm ent decrees, orig inating in foundation \"studies\", which are designed solely to set A merican against Am erican. Only in this way can the W orld Order maintain its iron grip on the daily lives of the people. The W orld Order also rules by the principle of 1984 - no groups of two or m ore people ar e allowed to gather unless the World Order has a repres entative presen t. If you start a club of dandelion fanciers, the Order will send som eone who will be qu ietly helpful, avoid tak ing the front po sition, and who will offer to pay the ren t of a m eeting place or th e printing of the m inutes. In more radical groups, the Order' s repres entative will be th e first to sug gest dynam iting a bu ilding, assass inating an official, o r other violent action. The inte rnational ter rorism of the Comm unist Pa rty originated in a sm all club of Germ an and French work ing m en in Paris, ded icated to quiet reading and d iscuss ion, u ntil Karl Marx join ed. It was then converted into a revolutionary group. This one example explains the Order' s determ ination to allow no group, however insign ificant, to rem ain unm onitored. The W orld Order adopted the Hegelian dialectic, the dialectic of m aterialism , which regards the World as Power, and the W orld as Reality. It denies all other powers and all other realities. It functions on the pr incip le of thesis, an tith esis and a synthes is which results when the thesis and an tith esis are thrown against each o ther for a pred eterm ined outcom e. Thus the W orld Order organ izes and finances Jewish groups; it then organizes a nd finances anti-Jewish groups; it organizes Communist groups; it then organizes and finances anti-Communist gr oups. It is not necessary for the Order to throw these groups against each o ther; they seek each other out lik e heat-seeking missiles, an d try to d estroy each other. By cont rolling th e size and res ources of each group, the World Order can always predeterm ine the outcom e. In this technique, m embers of the World Order ar e of ten iden tified with o ne side or the other. John Foster Dulles arran ged f inancin g f or Hitler, but he was n ever a Naz i. David Rockef eller may be cheered in Moscow, but he is not a Co mmunist. However, the Order always turns up on the winning side. A distinguishing trait of a m ember of the Worl d Order, although it m ay not be adm itted, is that he do es not believe in anyt hing b ut the W orld Order. Another dis tingu ishing trait is his absolute contem pt for anyone who actually be liev es in th e ten ets of Communis m , Zionism , Christian ity , or any national, religious or fr aternal group, although the Order has 57"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"members in contro lling position s in all of thes e groups.

Its origins as an intern ational force go back to the Phoeni cian slave-traders, continues through the Phnar iot f amilies of the Byzantin e Em pire, then the Venetian and Gen oese tr ader s and bankers of the Middle Ages, who m oved into Sp ain and Portugal, and later into England and Scotland. B y the 14th C entury, the Genoese co ntro lled th e Scottish lan dlords. The Im perial Fa mily of the Byzantine Em pire, the Paleologues (m eaning ' the W ord' ) we re attacked by the Gnostic faction, whose m aterialistic Aristote lian philosophy was the forerunner of Hegelian dialective and Marxism . The Paleologues devoutly believed in the Christian faith, as expressed by the Orthodox Rite. The m aterialistic Venetian and Genoese arm ies, with the aid of the Turkish \"infidels\", looted and conquered Consta ntinople, the legendary \"City of God\". The Byzantine s urvivors recreated their cultu re in R ussia, with Moscow as \"the third R ome\". The plan to destroy the Orthodox Church with its Rom anov (new Rom e) leaders was the hidden goal of the First World W ar. The vict ors cam e away with one billion dollars of the Rom anov fortune, after achieving the defeat of thei r hated enem y, the Orthodox Church. During the Middle Ages, European power centers coalesced into two camps, the Ghibellines, those who supported the Em peror' s Hohenstaufen fa mily, (an Italian ad aptation of Weinblingen, the nam e of the Hohenstaufen estate), and the Guelphs, from Welf, the Germ an prince who com peted with Fred erick for control of the Holy Rom an Em pire. The Pope then allied him self with the Gu elphs aga inst the Ghibe llines re sultin g in their victory. All of modern history stem s directly from the struggle betw een these two po wers. The Guelphs, also called the N eri, or B lack Guelphs, and Black Nobility, were the Norm ans w ho conquered England in the 11th century; the Genoese who backed Robert Bruce in his conque st of Scotlan d, and who supported W illiam of Orange in his seizure of the throne of England. William' s victory resulted in the form ation of the Bank of England and the East India Com pany, which have rule d the world since the 17th century. Every subsequent coup d' etat, revolutio n and war has centered in the battle of the Guelphs to hold and enhance their power, which is now the World Order. The power of the Guelphs grew through their cont rol of banking and intern ational trade. It was extended through the Italian centers to the north of Florence, in Lom bardy, which becam e great financial centers. All Italian ba nkers, including the Genoese, th e Venetians, and Milanese, were referred to as \"Lom bards\": Lom bard, in Ge rm an, m eans \"papers of m onetary value (Wertpapiere) \"; the Lombards were bankers to the enti re Medieval world. Modern history begins with the transfer of their operations north to Ham burg, Am sterdam , and fi nally to London. The great A merican fortunes orig inated with the Guelph slav e trad e to th e colonies. Many of the slave traders doubled in piracy. Trinity Church, whose leading vestrym an later was J.P. Morgan, was originally known as \"the church of the pira tes\". Capt. W illiam Kidd provided the m aterial to build it in 1697, and a pew was reserved for him. He was arrested the ne xt year, and hanged in chains at Newgate. In 1711, a slave m arket was set up on Wall Street near the church, and functioned there for m any years. 58"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"Two of the most powerful influences in the worl d today are the internat ional drug trade, which began with the East India Co., and internati onal espionage, w hich began with the Bank of England.

In February 1972, the Mississippi Air and Pollution Control Comm ission ordered that the Agen t Orange stored at Gulfport be rem oved imm ediately. Faced with this, th e Air Force tried r eturnin g the rem aining stocks of Agent Orange to its manufacturers, who refused to accept the offer. Ai r Force officials also s uggested that the surplus herbicide be disposed of \"by the prudent dispos ition of herbicide Orange for use on privately owned or governm entally owned lands.\" This plan also failed and, seven years after the barrels were rem oved from Vietnam , the EPA finally gr anted the Air Force a pe rmit to incine rate the rem aining stocks of Agent Orange on the Germ an-built ship Vulcnus in the South Pacific.

You have to have som e understand ing of viruses, bacteria, hum an cell origin, tissue culture and manipulation of all those th ings within the laboratory.

Some of you people are convinced, and I shall not confuse you, that viruses are the sm allest re plicating m icro-organism . Tha t m eans they are thought to be the sm allest replicating organism that require other c ells in which to grow the mselves. That viruses are not capable of reproducing them selves on their ow n, outside of living tissue, is the conviction of the scientists today. Viruses must inhabit another cell for potential growth and reproduction. Bacteria, fungus, and som e other organism s are actu ally capable of growing outside of tissue, in other words, they don' t have to inhabit other tissue to reproduce them selves. They can grow on tissue culture plates such as bact eria. The viruses must grow insi de of tissue which requires that there be living hum an or anim al tissue in which they m ay replicate. Retrovirus m eans that it is a sm all re plica ting o rganism which grows inside of living tissue. So what does th e term \"retro \" m ean? In the case of th is particular virus, it stands for the fact that contained within the AIDS virus, and other so -called hum an retrovirus es, or other anim al retroviruses, are sm all enzym es know n as reverse transcriptase.

Before modern day AIDS, the region of greatest density of Ka posi's Sarcom a was on the border of Zaire and Uganda.

A correlation between antibod ies to HTLV-III/LAV (HIV) and antibodies to m alaria is also noted. Another correlation noticed by these researchers, is the striking similitude between the di stribution of AIDS and that of TB . When W hiteside and MacLeod tested Florida patients for over 50 arbor-virus , they found that a very high percentage tested positive to dengue and maguari viruses . The first one causes a painful disease sim ilar to a severe flu ( Dengue is the nam e of a tropical dance characterized by body contortions sim ilar to those th e victim s of this di sease suffer due to spasm s and pain), the second had not been known to cause diseases in anim als or hum ans, but belongs to a fa mily of viruses asso ciated with Kaposi' s Sarcom a. The Dengue antibodies found were two types of Dengue viruses: Dengue I and Dengue II, which have done quite a bit of suspicious internationa l traveling. \"Dengue type I - had been lim ited to S.E. Asia and Africa until 1977, when it appeared in Jam aica, Cuba and Puerto Rico. It later spread to Ha iti and othe r Caribbean Is lands.\" An epidem ic occurred in Cuba in 1977 that was not only the first Dengue I, but the first Dengue epidem ic since 1944.

A 1982 CAI B investigation concluded that the 1981 hem orrhagic Dengue type II epidem ic in Cuba and another in 1977 were \"a lm ost cer tainly the resu lt of U.S. biological warfare.

It is also worth m entioning, that Russia alle gedly produced the ultim ate CBW weapon in the for m of a mutant Dengue virus known as D7 , which m ight have found its way into different countries by troop m ovem ents or other m eans. If an epidemic like this is of such great concern, why does it take 6 years to m ake this inf orm ation public ? Lederer questions the validity of the Dengue-Maguari AIDS link, because the countries with high levels of Dengue have low levels of AIDS.

Most im portant of these is that it m ight be refractory to the immunol ogical and therapeutic processes upon which we depend to maintain our relative fr eed om from infectiou s disease.\" What is a virus? In his book Virus Hunting, AID S, Cancers and the Human Retrovirus , Dr. Robert C. Gallo (the doctor who is credited with the discovery of AIDS) states that v iruses are \"obligate cellular parasites\". This m eans they need another m edium in which to grow and reproduce, therefore they invade a living cell and us e it as their new home. Viruses are the sm allest known living organism , needing an el ectron m icroscope or sim ilar device at 50,000X magnification to be seen. Viruses can live outside of living tis sue in cry stal form indef inite ly. AIDS is also known at HTLV-III or Hum an T-Cell Lym photrophic Virus. It is a retrovirus that atta cks the T-4 cells of the imm une system . A retrovirus is a v irus th at has a special enzym e, reverse transcriptase, that is ab le to incorporate itself into th e DNA o f the host cell, thereby using the DNA of that cell to reproduce m ore virus, B cells are the part of the imm une system that help to produce protective antibodies. The T-4 cells of the imm une system are lym phocytes, or sm all white blood cells, acted upon by hormones in the thym us gland before they reach the blood stream . T-4 cells help speed up the production of an ti-bodies by the B cells. Therefore, if the T-4 cells are d estroyed the b ody is unable to aid th e B cells in an tibody prod uction and will die of any opportunistic infection. Viruses are also known to lie latent in the inf ected organism . Thus, though they are present and potentially harmful, they are dorm ant, not seek ing cells for reproduction. AIDS is known to have a 3 to 5 years incubation tim e before the viru s begins actively reproduc ing and im pairing the immune system to infection. In 1972 at the Biological Warfare Convention it was decided to di sm antle our biological warfare arsenals. Robert Harris and Jerem y Paxm an point out in A Higher Form Of Killing , \"With the decision to renounce germ warfare for all tim e, Fort Detrick had been handed over to the civilian National Cancer Institute.

In his video The Strecker Memorandum he reveals that in the early 70s \"The Da nish Cancer Registry (an international panel of experts) noted that it is pos sible to visua lize the m utati on of a virus into variety of high contageosity to m an resulting in a pandem ic of neo-plastic dis ease before we could develop a vaccine. \" Dr. Strecker co ncurs with the concept that AIDS was created in a laboratory from the bovine and visna virus through recombinant DNA. Not only was the W orld Health Organization (W HO), via Fort Detrick, responsible for the creation of AIDS, but there is overwhelm ing e vidence that it was also responsible for the deliberate, initial introduction of AIDS into the world populati on. In 1987 Science E ditor Pearce Wright wrote an article \"Sm all pox vaccine trigg ered AIDS virus\". The World Health Organizatio n began a 13 -year sm all pox vaccination program in Third World coun tries ending in 1981. The sm all pox vaccine was co ntam inated with the AIDS virus. Though W HO has adm itted through its o wn investig ation th at th e vaccine was contam inated, it has sup pressed its findings. Wright 's article, which linked the vaccination pr ogram and the increase of AIDS victim s in the Third W orld, especially Africa, was gi ven no press in the United States.- A further connection is pointed out by Lt. Col. T. E. Bearden in his book Aids Biological Warfare. He states, \"The sm all pox vaccine theory would account for the position of the Central African states as the m ost a fflicted countries, why Brazil beca me the m ost affected Latin Am erican country, and how Haiti b ecam e the route fo r the s pread of AIDS to the U.S.; Brazil, the only South Am erican country covered in the eradication cam paign, has the highest incidence of AIDS in that region.\" The pollutio n of vaccine, includ ing the Salk vaccine for polio is extensively covered in a video by Dr. Eva Snead entitled AIDS: The Other Side Of The Story. She reveals how the polio vaccine prior to 1962 was known to be contam inated with SV-40 (sim ian virus 40). This virus contam inated the vaccin e because th e polio vacci ne was grown on the kid ney cells of monkeys and sim ian or m onkey virus contam inated the va ccine that w as given to the public. D r. Snead also points out that research has shown that SV-40 is ideally suited for genetic m anipulation, splicing and the creation of hybrids or m utants. Since it is known that the AIDS virus, or HTLV- III ha s cre ated m any mutant s trains s ince its orig inal dis covery, there is a possible con nection between the SV-40 virus, and contam ination of the widely - and m andatorily - given polio vaccines. Again, the inform ation of the contam ination of the polio vaccine with a dangerous sim ian virus was withheld from the public, thoug h the governm ent was well aware of this fact. The governm ent would have us believe that AI DS started in the hom osexual population and has been spread likewis e.

Em phasis is placed on attempting to bridge the gap between scientists and decision-m akers. The resu lts of studies are wide ly communicated through publica tions distr ibuted by m embers scien tific in stitu tion s, an d an ef fort is m ade to inf orm the non-expert of the results of st udies of international problem s. Two current m ajor global proj ects are on energy system s and on food and agriculture. The energy pro ject is concentrating on finding strategies for the tran sition over the next 15 to 50 years from an energy econom y based on oil, gas, and conventional coal to an econom y based on the virtually inexhaustible resources - solar, nuclear, and geotherm al - as well as to so me extent on new sources of coal. Resear ch activities include studying system s im plications of the exploitation of scarce energy resour ces; energy dem and studies, such as one that projects global energy dem and with regard to the developm ent of regions, world population growth, and changes in life-style; and a study of strategies relating the nuclear-risk problem to decision- making. The final energy projec t report is expected in 1979. Although IIASA is composed of scientific repr esentatives from industrial nations, the food and agriculture program is concerned also with a number of less developed countries (LDCs) that have agricultural econom ies. The program objectives are to evaluate the nature and dim ensions of the world food situation, to study alternative policy actions at the national, regional, and global level that m ay alleviate existing and em erging food problem s, and to determ ine how to meet the nutritional needs of the growing global population. Typical projects include devel oping a m odel of t he dynam ic inte rdependence between m igration and hum an s ettlem ent patterns and agricultu ral technology, identifying and m easuring the environm ental consequences of water use in agri culture as constraints on agricu ltu ral struc tures 77"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"of som e pilot LDCs - describing their agricu ltu ral policy ob jec tives and devising planning models suita ble f or estimating the co nse quences of alterna tiv e nation al p olicies. NATIONAL COMMISSION ON SUPPLI ES AND SHORTAGES: ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON NATIONAL GR OWTH POLICY PROCESSES (1975) Another Nix on-Ford era initiative in the m ateri als f ield with a m ajor institu tiona l objec tive was the National Comm ission on Supplies and Shorta ges and its separate Advisory Committee on National Growth Policy Processes. T hese activ ities, like the 1971-73 National Comm ission on Materials Policy, were conceived by Congress. The Comm ission did not attem pt any new da ta collection or make supply-and-dem and projections into the future. Inst ead it analyzed available info rm ation, concluding that \"we see little reason to f ear tha t the wo rld will run out of natural reso urces during the [next] quarter century. \" The Comm ission' s report, Government and the N ation's Resources , was releas ed the f irst week of 1977. In its repor t to the Pr esid ent and Con gress, the Advisory Co mmittee urg ed that the n ation becom e not a planned society, but a planning society. Adequate and open planning for the future would result in less governm ent interference, an d the necessary governm ent intervention would be m ore considered, m ore tim ely, and less h eavy-handed. The report' s prim e recommendation was f or the institu tion alization of the planning process in an independent executive br anch agency to be created by C ongress and called the National Growth and Developm ent Comm ission. The new Comm ission would have the m andate \"to exam ine em erging issues of middle-to-long-range growth and developm ent, a nd to suggest feasible alternatives for the Congress, the Presid ent, and the public.\" [Still quotin g from The Global 2000 Report to the President of the United States - Entering the 21st Century, published in 1980:] SOME OBSERVATI ONS For the past 70 years the nation' s leadership has perceived peri odically a n eed for long -term analysis of problem s relating to natural resource s, population, or the envi ronm ent. For the m ost part, these issues have been addressed on an ad hoc basis by appointing presidential comm issions and other tem porary groups to study the situation, make their reports, and then disband. As a result, decision-m akers continue to deal prim arily with immediate problem s, while consideration of how to prepare for conditions that m ight exis t 10, 20, or 30 years in the future is postponed for lack of adequate or system atic inform ation on the options available and on the social, econom ic, and environm enta l im pacts of alternative choices. Future-oriented comm issions or study groups have generally studied natu ral resources problem s separately from problems related to population and the environm ent. There has been insufficient recognition of the interr elation of th ese three issues. Each su cceeding y ear, as th e problem s 78"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"becom e m ore com plex and the interrelationships more involved, the need for a holistic approach to decision-m aking becom es m ore urgent. Most analyses of future problem s in populati on, natural resources, and the environm ent have been m ade only on a national basis. President Trum an recognized the need for assessing global im plications of natural resources when he c onstructed his Materials Policy Comm ission in 1951 to m ake its study of m aterials polic y international in scope, at leas t to the extent of considering the needs and resources of friendly nations. But while the harmful effects of population growth, resource con sum ption, and pollution spread ac ross borders an d oceans, th e internation al approach to long-range planning for solutions to these problem s continues to be neglected. When comm issions or other bodies have been form ed to consider long-term problem s in population, natural resources , and the environm ent, their eff ectiveness has been ham pered by lack of provisions for following up on their r ecom mendations. In several cases the heads of comm issions felt so strongly about the need fo r ongoing institutions that they set up private organizations on their own to follow up with thei r group' s recomm endations, which have lead to som e efforts of ongoing analysis. One recomm endation has been m ade by virtua lly every presidential com mission on population, natural resources, or the envir onm ent: the establishm ent of a perm anent body som ewhere high in the executive branch for perform ing continuous f uture research and analysis. Although ideas for location of such a perm anent group have varie d, proposals have genera lly indicated that a statu torily c reated institu tion with ac cess to the P residen t cou ld explo re p otential goa ls, watch f or trends, and look at alterna tive possibilities for accom plishing stilted objectives. A perm anent institution would have much m ore fr eedom in choosing the mom ent to present new ideas, and thus avoid the tim ing and politics-related problem s that have often hindered activities of tem porary presidential comm issions. The inte rest of a President or C ongress or the public proved to be m uch greater at the time a study is started than when it is completed - T he Materials Policy Comm ission was appointed b y Presiden t Trum an in January 1951 , when m ilitary involvem ent in Korea had reintroduc ed fears of shortages that were still fresh in the m inds of adm inistrators and the public follow ing W orld War II. But when the Commission' s report went to the President in June 1952, the scarcity issue had lost its prio rity and public concern. W hen President Nixon sent a m essage to Congress in 1969 asking for creation of a comm ission to study population growth, the subject was politically at tractive inasmuch as people were concerned about rising birth rates. But by the time the Population Comm ission' s report was subm itted, statistics sho wed that th e birth rate in the nati on had already declined to a stability rate - two children per fa mily - and the subject had less po litical im portance. Another unfavorable tim ing factor was that the report was se nt to the President at the star t of his 1972 re-election cam paign; som e of the Comm ission' s reco mm endations raised controve rsy, causing th e Presiden t to repudiate the Comm ission' s work. On the other ha nd, the release of the report of the Outdoor Recreation Resources R eview Comm ission came at a tim e when the popularity of outdoor recreation was boom ing, and Congress welcom ed help in devising solutions to the problem s connected w ith the growing recr eation use of public lands, nationa l parks, and national forests. Another problem of ti ming was the frequent l ong delays between the requ est for a co mmission and its creation, or between the tim e the law wa s passed and the President appointed the public 79"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"members. Som etim es the period allowed for a study was too short, as with the preparation of Toward a Social Report . That study also ran into a frequent tim ing problem : having been started by one President, the stu dy is then su bm itted e ith er at the end of his term or to his suc cessor. For all these reasons, m any observers have urge d the establishm ent by law of a perm anent group in Executive Office of the President to institut ionalize the coordination of long-term global and holistic considerations of population, resource s, environm ent, and their related issues. MAJOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS IN THE GLOBAL 2000 REPORT If present trends continu e, the world in 2000 w ill be m ore crowded, m ore polluted, les s stable econom ically, and m ore vulnerable to disruption th an the world we live in now. Serious stresses involving population, resources, a nd environm ent are clearly vi sible ahead. Despite greater material output, the world' s people will b e poorer in m any wa ys than th ey are tod ay. For hundred s of m illions of the desperately poor, the outlook for food and other necess ities of life will b e no better. For m any it will be worse. Barring revo lutionary adv ances in technology, life for m ost people on E arth will be more precari ous in 2000 than it is now - unless the nations of the world act decisively to alter current trends. This, in ess ence, is the picture em erging from the U.S. Governm ent's projections of probable changes in world population, resources, and envir onm ent by the end of the century, as presented in the Global 2000 Study . They do not predict what will occu r. Rather, they depict conditions that are likely to develop if there are no cha nges in public policies, in stitutions, or rates of technological advance, and if there are no wars or other m ajor disruptions. A keener awareness of the nature of the current tre nds, however, m ay induce changes th at will alter these trends and the pro jected outcom e. Rapid growth in world population will hardly have altered by 2000. The world' s population will grow from 4 billion in 1975 to 6.35 billion in 2000, an increase of m ore than 50 percent. Ninety percent of this growth will occur in the poor est countries. World food production is projected to increase 90 percent over the 30 years from 1970 to 2000. At the sam e tim e, real prices for food are expected to double. Arable land will in crease only 4 percent by 2000, so that m ost of the increased outpu t of food will have to com e from higher y ields. Most of the elem ents tha t now contr ibute to h igher yie lds - fertilizer, pesticides, power for irrigation, and fuel for m achinery - depend heavily on oil and gas. During the 1 990s world oil produ ction will ap proach geolog ical estim ates of m aximum production capacity, even with rapidly increasing petroleum prices. The St udy projects that the richer indus trialized n ations will be able to command enough oil and o ther commercial energy supplies to m eet rising dem ands through 1990. W ith the expected price increases, m any less developed countries will have in creasing difficulties m eeting ener gy needs. For the one-quarter of hum ankind that depends prim arily on wood for fuel, the outlook is bleak. Needs for fuel-wood will exc eed available su pplies by ab out 25 perc ent bef ore the turn of the c entury. 80"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"While the w orld' s finite f uel resour ces - coa l, oil, gas shale, tar sands and uranium - are theoretically sufficient fo r centuries, they are not evenly dist ributed; they pose difficult econom ic and environm ental problem s; and they vary greatl y in their am enability to exploitation and use. Non-fuel m ineral resources generally appear su fficient to m eet projected dem ands through 2000, but further d iscoveries and investm ents will b e needed to m aintain reserv es. In addition, production costs will increase with energy prices and m ay make som e non-fuel m ineral resources uneconom ic. The quarter of the world' s population th at inhabits industrial countries will continue to absorb thr ee-f ourths o f the world' s m ineral production. Regional water sho rtag es will becom e m ore se vere. In the 197 0-2000 period populatio n growth alone will cause requirem ents for water to double in nearly half th e world. Still greater increases would be needed to im prove standards of liv ing. In m any LDCs, water supplies will becom e increasingly erratic by 2000 as a result of extensive deforesta tion. Developm ent of new water supplies will becom e m ore co stly virtually everywhere. Significant losses of world forests will continue over the next 20 years as dem and for forest products and fuel-wood increases. Serious deterioration of agricultural soils will oc cur worldwide, due to erosion, loss of organic matter, desertification, salinization, alkaliniza tion, and water-logging. Already, an area of cropland and grassland approxim ately the size of Maine is becom ing barren wasteland each year, and the spread of desert-like c ond itio ns is likely to accelerate. At mospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and ozone-depleting chem icals are expected to increase at rates that could alter the world' s climate and uppe r atm osphere significantly by 2050. Acid rain from increased com bustion of fossil fuel s (especially coal) th reatens dam age to lak es, soils, and crops. Radioactive and ot her hazardo us m aterials present health and safety problem s in increasing num bers of countries. Extinctions of plant and anim al sp ecies will incr ease dram atic ally. The future d epicted by the U.S. Governm ent pr ojections, briefly outlin ed above, m ay actually understate the im pending problem s. At present and projected growth rates, the world' s population would reach 10 billion by 2030 and would approach 30 billion by the end of the twenty -first century.

Indeed, the problem s of preserving the carryi ng capacity of the Earth and sustaining the possibility o f a decent life for the hu man beings that inhab it it are eno rmous and close upon us. Yet there is reason for hope. It m ust be em phasized that the Global 2000 Study's pro jection s are based on the assum ption that national policies regarding population stab ilization, resource conservation, and environm ental pro tection will r emain essentia lly unchanged through the end of the Century. 81"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"The United States, possessing the world' s larges t econom y, ca n expect its policies to have a significant influence on global trends .

AGENDA 2 1 - THE EARTH SUM MIT In the book Agenda 21: The Earth Summit Strategy To Save Our Planet , edited by Daniel Sitarz, we find [quoting:] Agenda 21 is, first and f orem ost, a docum ent of hope. Adopted at the Earth Summ it in Brazil [1992] by na tions representing over 98% of the Eart h's population, it is the principal global plan to confront and overcome the econom ic and ecol ogical problem s of the late 20th century. It provides a com prehensive blueprint for hum anity to use to f orge its way into the next century by proceed ing more gently upon the Earth. As its sw eeping prog ram s are im plem ented world-wide, it will even tually im pact on every hu man activity on our planet. Deep and dram atic changes in hum an society are proposed by th is monum ental historic agr eem ent. Understanding those changes is e ssential to g uide us a ll into the f utur e on our f ragile p lanet. Hum anity is at a crossro ads of enormous cons equence. Nev er before has civilizatio n faced an array of pro blem s as critical as the o nes now faced. As forbidding and portentous as it m ay sound, what is at stake is nothing less th an the global survival of hum an kind. The effects of hum an i mpact upon th e Earth hav e been accelerating at a ra te unforeseen even a handful of decades ago. Where once nature seemed forever th e dom inant force on Earth, evidence is rapidly accu mulating that hum an infl uence over nature has reached a point where natural forces m ay soon be overwhelm ed. Only ve ry recently have the citizens of Earth begun to appreciate the depth of the poten tial danger of hum an i mpact on our planet.

Hum an i mpact upon these vital substances has reached the point of causing potentially irrev ersible dam age. Scientis ts a roun d the worl d, in every country on Earth, are docum enting the hazards of ignoring our dependence upon the natural world. There is s trong evidence from the world' s scientif ic comm unity that hum anity is very, very close to crossing certain ecological thresholds for the support of life on Earth. The Earth' s ozone layer , our only protection from the harm ful rays of th e Sun is being depleted. Massive erosion is causing a rapid loss in the fertile so il of our planet and with it a potentially drastic drop in the ability to produce food for the world' s people. Vast destruction of the world' s forests is contributing to the spread of the world' s dese rts, increasing the loss of bio-diversity and ham pering the ability of the Earth' s atm osphere to cleans e its elf.

The land anim als and plants of our planet are experien cing a rate of extinction unseen on Earth since the tim e of the dinosaurs; extinctions brought on not by cataclysm ic events of nature but by the im pact of a single species : homo-sapiens. The incr easing pollution of air, water and land by hazardous and tox ic waste is ca using wide-spread h ealth problem s that are only now beginning to be understood. All of these problem s are being intensified by the explosive growth in the sheer num bers of hum an beings in the last half of the 20th century. For the firs t tim e in histo ry, hum anity m ust f ace the risk of un inten tionally destroy ing the foundation of life on Earth. The globa l scientific consensus is that if the current levels of environm ental deterio ration continue, the delica te lif e-sus tain ing qualities of this plane t will collap se. It is a stark and fri ghtening potential. To prevent su ch a collapse is an aweso me challenge for the global Communit y. [Continuing to quote portions of Agenda 21 :] In Decem ber of 1989, the General A ssem bly of t he United Nations confronted th is daunting task. The urgency of the problem s of developm ent and environm ent prom pted the nations of the world to call for an unpreceden ted m eeting - a m eeting of all of the nations on E arth - an Earth summ it. The United Nations Conference on E nvironm ent and Developm ent was se t for June of 1992 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The scope of attendance at this h istoric meetin g clearly d efines the importance of its tas k. It was, very simply, the largest gathering of heads of state in the history of life on Earth. On June 13, 1992, nearly 100 w orld leaders met around a single table in Rio de Janeiro in the largest face-to-face meeting of national leaders in the history of international diplomacy. Agenda 21 is not a static docum ent. It is a plan of action. It is m eant to be a hands-on instrum ent to guide the developm ent of the Earth in a sust ainable m anner. Recognizi ng the global nature of the environ mental problem s that face hum anity, it is b ased o n the prem ise that sustainable developm ent of the Earth is not simply an option: it is a req uirem ent - a requir ement incre asing ly 92"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"im posed by the lim its of nature to absorb th e punishm ent which hum anity has inflicted upon it. Agenda 21 is also based on the prem ise that sustai nable developm ent of the Earth is entirely feasible. Th e trans ition to a gl obal civilization in balance with nature will be an exceedingly difficult task, but Agenda 21 is the collective glob al alert tha t there is no alternative. W e m ust align hum an civilization with the natural equili brium of our planet and we m ust do so very rapidly if we are to prevent an irreversib le decline in the quality of life on Earth. The bold goal of Agenda 21 is to halt and reverse the environm ental da mage to our planet and to prom ote environm entally sound and sustainable de velopm ent in all countries on Earth. It is a bluepr int f or action in all areas relatin g to the su stainable developm ent of our planet into the 21st century. It c alls f or spe cific changes in the ac tivit ies of all people. It includes concrete m easures and incen tiv es to redu ce the environ mental im pact of the industrialized nations, revitalize developm ent in developing nations, elim inate pov erty world-wide and stabilize the level of hum an population. Effective execution of Agenda 21 will require a p rofound reorient ation of all hum an society, unlike any thing the world has ever experien ced - a m ajor shif t in th e prio rities of both governm ents and indiv iduals and an unpreceden ted red eploy ment of human and finan cial resources. T his shift will dem and that a concer n for the env ironm ental con sequences o f every hum an action be integrated into individual and co llective d ecision- making at every level. The success ful im ple mentation of the far-rang ing action s proposed by Agenda 21 will r equir e active participation by people th roughout the world, at the loca l, national and global levels. There are measures that are direct ed at all lev els of society - f rom international bodies such as the United Nations and the World Bank to local groups and indi viduals. There are specific action s whic h are in tend ed to be und ertak en by multinationa l corpor atio ns and entr epreneurs, by financial ins titu tions and individu al investors, by high tech co mpanies and indigenous people, by workers and labor unions, by farm ers and cons um ers, by students and schools, by governm ents and legislators, by scientists, by women, by ch ildren - in short, by every person on Earth. The overall levels and patterns of hum an consum ption and production m ust be com patible with the finite capacities of the Earth. As the hum an population o n Earth in creases, th ere will be ev er greater pressure for people th roughout the world to attain a higher standard of living. If the model lifestyle for this increas ing po pulace is ba sed on the cu rrent exces sive consum ption levels and inefficient production m ethods of the industr ialized countries, the th resholds of econom ic and environ mental disas ter will soon be reach ed. Sustainab le patterns of consum ption and efficient m ethods of production m ust be de veloped and encouraged in all societies. One of the most im portant root causes of the intensifying hum an i mpact on our planet is the unpreceden ted growth in the sheer nu mbers of hum an beings in the last 50 years. The world' s population is now growing by nearly 100 m illion people every year. Popu lation pres sures are placing increasing s tres s on the eco logical system s of the planet.

Increased nutritional and sanitary m easures prob ably deserv e credit. Som e diseases m ay also have their own evolutionary cycles ; the virulen t nature of the virgin d isea se is transf ormed into a tam e illness as m embers of the population are exposed to it and gain \"herd\" imm unity. 2) None of the vaccin es can confer genuine immunity. Often the opposite is true; the vaccine increases th e chance of contracting the diseas e. (Published \"v accine efficacy rates\" are misleading. They are often evaluated by m eas uring blood antibody levels - not by com paring infection rates in vaccin ated and unv accinated persons.) 3) All of the vaccines can produce side-effects. Reactions ra nge from soreness at the injection site to brain dam age and death. 4) The long-term effects of all vaccin es are unknown. Particularly distressing are the im plications that vaccines can be devastating to the young child' s imm ature imm une s ystem . Studies were presented showing impaired h ealth protection followi ng injections. Lowered physical defenses m ay be responsible for a new breed of autoimmune diseases. Other studies showed damage to the brain and nervous syst em following shots - post- vaccinal encep halitis. This, in turn, causes large num bers of children to grow up with physical, m ental and emotional disabilities of varying degrees. All of these conditions affect the i ndividual, his or her fa mily, and society as well. 5) Several of the vaccines can be especially dangerous. Neve rthele ss, the Medica l-lnd ustrial Com plex continues to mainta in its de ceptiv e prac tice of disregarding vaccine reactions. In fact, medical offi cials recently suggest ed that they were justified in adm inistering new and unproven vaccines by claim ing it is unethical to withhold them ! Meanwhile, creative propaganda on the merits of vaccinations rem ains a lucrative ploy. F or exam ple, the AMA adm its that \"adult vaccines need a gimm ick.\" CDC phys icians suggest a catchy slogan, like \" Vaccines are not just kid stuff.\" Our policy-makers have lobbied for la ws against freedom of choice. Their patterns of coercion and denial are notori ous among the enlightened mem bers of the population (parents who question vaccines ), though sadly their awakenings m ay have cost them dearly - often the life or health of their own child. [End quoting.] MURDE R BY INJE CTION In his book Murder By Injection - The Story Of The Medical Conspiracy Against America , Eustace Mu llins writes [ quoting:] One of the few doctors who has dared to speak out against the Medical Monopoly, Dr. Robert S. Mendelsohn, dram atized his stand against Modern Medicine by de fining it as a Church which has Four Holy W aters. The first of th ese, he listed as Vaccination. Dr Mendelsohn term ed vaccination \"of question able safety. \" However, ot her doctors have been more explicit. It is notable that the Rockefeller in terests have fought throughout the nineteenth century to m ake these Four Holy W aters com pulsory throughout th e United S tates, ignoring all the protests and warnings of their dangers. 95"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"Of these four item s, whi ch m ight we ll be term ed the Four Horsem en of the Apocalypse , because they too are known to bring death and destruction in their wake, th e m ost pernicious in its long- term effects m ay well be the prac tice of i mmuniz ation. This prac tice goes direc tly against the discovery of m odern holistic m edical experts th at the body has a natural im mune defense against illn ess. The Church of Modern Me dicine cla ims th at we c an only be ab solved f rom the per il of infection by the Holy W ater of v accination, injecting into the sy stem a foreign body of infection, which will then perform a Medical Miracle, and will confer life-long imm unity, hen ce the term , \"imm unization.\" The greatest here sy any physician can commit is to voice publicly any doubt of any one of the Four Holy W aters, but the m ost d eeply en tren ched in m odern m edical practice is undoubtedly the num erous vaccin ation program s. They are also the m ost consistently profitable operations of the Medical Monopoly. Yet one physician, Dr. Henry R. Bybee, of Norfolk, Virginia, has publicly stated, \"My honest opinion is that vaccine is the cause of m ore disease and suffering than anything I could nam e. I believe that such diseases as cancer, syphilis, cold sores and m any ot her disease conditions are the direct results of vaccination. Yet, in the state of Virginia, and in m any other states, parents ar e co mpelled to s ubm it their c hildr en to th is procedure while the m edical p rofe ssion not only receives its pay for this service, but also m akes splendid and prospective patients for the future.\" From London com es an alarm ing obs ervation from a practitioner of excellent reputation and long experience. Dr. Herbert Snow, senior surge on at the Cancer Hospital of London, voiced his concern, \"in recen t years m any men and wom en in the prim e of life have dropped dead suddenly, often after attending a feast or a banquet. I am convinced that som e eighty percent of these deaths are caused by the inoculation or vaccin ation they have undergone. They are well known to cause grave and perm anent dis ease o f the heart. The coroner always hus hes it up as \"natural causes\". You cannot find any such warning in any m edical textbook or popular boo k on health. In fact, this write r was able to lo cate it in a s mall volum e buried deep in the stacks in the Library of Congress . Yet such an om inous obse rvation from an established m edical practitioner should be as widely circulated as possible, if only to be attacked by those who can refute its prem ise. At leas t it cann ot be attacked by the Establishm ent as quackery, because Dr. Snow is not attem pting to sell som e substitute f or vacc inat ion, but m erely warning of its dangers. Another practitioner, Dr. W . B. Clarke of Indiana, finds th at \"Cancer was practically unknown until com pul sory vaccination with co wpox vaccin e began to b e introduced . I have had to deal with at least two hundred cases of cancer, and I never saw a case of cancer in an unvaccinated person.\" At last, we have the breakthrough for which the Am erican Cancer Society has been searching, at such great expense, and for so m any years. Dr. Clarke has n ever seen a cas e of cancer in an unvaccinated person. Is not this a lead which should be explo red? In the land where freedom rings, or is supposed to ring, it is even m ore surprising to find that every c itize n is com pelled to subm it to a com pulsory vaccination ritu al.

From the outset, ou r m ost distinguished m edical experts have proudly inf orm ed us that AIDS is incurab le, which is har dly the ap proach we expect from those who demand that we accept their infallib ility in all things to do with medicin e. Another well known m edical practi tioner, Dr. J. M. Peebles of San Francisco, has written a book on vaccine, in which he s ays, \"The vaccination pr actice, push ed to the fro nt on all occasions by the m edical profession through pol itical connivance m ade compulsory by the state, has not only becom e the chief m enace and the g reates t danger to the health of the rising generation, but likewise the crowning outr age upon the personal liberties of th e Am erican citizen; compulsory vaccination, poisoning th e crim son currents of th e hum an system with brute-extracted ly mph under the strange infatuation that it would prev ent sm allpox, was one of the darkest blots that disfigured the last century.\" Dr. Peebles refers to the fact that co wpox vaccin e was one of th e m ore peculiar \"inventions or discoveries of the Age of Enlightenm ent.\" However, as I have pointed out in The Curse Of Canaan , the Age of Enlightenm ent was m erely the la test program of the Cult of Baal and its ritu als of child sacrifice, which, in one guise or another, has now been with us for some five thousand years. Because of this goal, the Med ical Monopoly is also know n as \"The So ciety for Crippling C hildren.\" Perhaps the most telling comment of Dr. Peebles' critic ism is his ref erence to \"bru te-extrac ted lym ph.\" Could there be som e conne ction between th e injection of this su bstance and the spread of a hitherto unknown form of can cer, cancer of the lym ph glands? This type of cancer is not only one of the m ost commonly encount ered versions of this disease; it is also one of the m ost difficult to treat, because it rapidl y spreads throughout th e entire system . A diagnosis of cancer of the lym ph glands now m eans a virtual death sentence.

It was th e first war in which vaccination was com pul sory for all s ervicem en. The Boston Herald reported that forty-seven soldie rs had been killed by vaccina tion in one month. As a re sult, th e m ilitary hosp itals were filled, not w ith wounded com bat casualties, but with casualties of the vaccine. The ep idem ic was called \"th e Spanish Influenza ,\" a deliberately m isleading a ppellation, which was intended to conceal its o rigin.

In recent y ears, annu al recu rring epidem ics of flu recalled \"the Russian Flu.\" For som e reason, the Russians ne ver protest, perhaps be cause the Rockefellers make regular trips to Moscow to lay down the party line. The perils of vaccina tion were alread y known. Plain Talk m agazine notes that \"during the Franco-Prussian W ar, every Germ an soldie r was vaccinated. The result was that 53,28 8 otherwise healthy m en developed sm allpox. The death rate w as high.\" In what is now known a s \"the Great Swine Flu Massacre,\" the Presiden t of the United States, Gerald Ford, was enlisted to persuade the publ ic to undergo a national vaccination campaign. The m oving force behind the schem e was a $135 m illion windfall profit f or the m ajor drug manufacturers. They had a \" swine flu \" vaccine which suspicious pig raisers had refused to touch, fearful it m ight wipe out their crop. The m anufa cturers had only tried to get $80 m illion from the swine breed ers; balked in this sa le, they turned to the other m arket, humans. The impetus for the national swine flu vaccine cam e directly from the Disease Control Cen ter in Atlanta, Georgia. Perhaps coincidentally, Jimmy Carter , a m ember of the Trilateral Commi ssi on , was then planning his presidential cam paign in Georgia. T he incum bent Presid ent, Gerald Ford , had all the advantages of a m assive bureaucr acy to aid him in his election cam paign, while the ineffectual and little known Jimmy Carter offe red no serious threat to the el ection. S uddenly, out of Atlanta, cam e the Centers for Dis ease Contro l plan for a national immunization campaign against \"swine flu.\" The fact that there was not a single known case of this f lu in the United States did not deter the Medical Monopoly from their schem e. The swine breeders had been shocked by the dem onstrations of the vaccine on a few pigs, wh ich had collapsed and died. One can im agine the anxious con ferences in the headquarters of th e g reat drug firm s, until one brigh t you ng m an rem arked, \"W ell, if the swine breed ers won' t inject it in to th eir an im als, our only other m arket is to inject it in to people. \" The Ford-sponsored swine flu cam paign alm ost di ed an early death, when a conscientious public servant, Dr. Anthony Morris, form erly of HEW and then active as director of the Virus Bureau of the Food and Drug Adm inistration, declared that there could be no authentic swine flu vaccine, b ecause there h ad never been any cases of swine flu on which th ey could test it. Dr. Morris then went public with his statem ent that \"at no point were the swine flu vaccines effective.\" He was promptly fired, but the dam age had been done. The dam age control consisted of that great hum anitarian, Walter Cronki te, and the Presiden t of the United States, co mbining their forces to com e to the rescue of the Me dical Monopoly. Walter Cronkite had P resident Ford appear on his news program to urge the Am erican people to s ubm it to the inocula tion with the swine flu vaccine.

All of the anim als were imm ediately destroyed, and Morris' records were burned. They did not go so far as to sow salt throughout the area, because they believed their job was done. On April 15, 1976, Congress pas sed Public Law 94-266, which provided $135 m illio n of taxpayers' funds to pay for a national swine flu inoculation campaign. HEW was to distribute the vaccine to state and local health agen cies on a n ational basis f or inocu latio n, at no charge.

A nd what of the perpetrator of the Great Swine Flu Massacre, President Gerald Ford? As the l ogical person to blam e for the catastrophe, Ford had to endure a torren t of public c ritic ism, which quite na tura lly resulted in h is def eat for election (h e had previously been appointed when the agents of the international drug operations had ushered Richard Nix on out of office). The un known Jimmy Carter, fam iliar only to the sup er-secret fellow m embers of the T rilateral Commission, wa s swept into office by the outpouring of rage against Gerald Ford. Carter proved to be alm ost as seriou s a n ational dis aster as the sw ine flu epidem ic, while Gerald Ford was retired from po litics to life.

In the case o f Rifkin' s concern abou t the sm allpox vaccinatio n, the m ain concern was to find possible \"BIV\" closely related to the hum an AIDS virus - and people at high risk of exposure, such as m eatpackers, for BIV antibod ies.

Acco rding to Fox and Baum , \"The ability of SV-40 genetic m aterial to increase the yield of adenovirus by 100 or 1,000 fold has been termed enhancem ent.\" On the other hand, stocks E46 and SP2 of a certain strain of adenovirus (type 7) can induce the inform ation of papovavirus SV40 tumor antigen (T antigen) in African Green Monkey Kidney cells (GMK) . W hat actually happens is that a new vi rus m ay form when an adenovirus acquires new genetic m aterial from the 8V-40 viru s. Thes e viral com binations were called hybrids in 1965, whereas today they are referred to as recombinants . Since we have established this equivalence, we m ust becom e aware, at th is m oment, that genetic engine ering was alive and well long before anyone had used that term, and in to tal absence of any containm ent precautions or regulations. The im pact this m ay have had on the environm ent is probably just m anifesting with the plagues of the eighties and nineties.

[End quoting.] CONSIDE R THIS While it m ay seem that I have presented m any unre lated and divergent writings in this series on depopulatio n of a planet, I believe b y now you will see the direct connection and ho w, once again, Little Crow' s phra se, \"E verything is connected to ev erything\", is reaffirm ed. The groundwork laid by Thom as Malthus, Georg Hegel, Karl Marx, the Fabian Society, G eorge Orwell, Bertrand Russell and Aldous Huxley, we re carried as them es through countless publications concerning the issue of population. When exa mining the cou ntless book s on population it becom es exceed ingly clear th at, for over a century, great and not so great m inds have put th eir con centr ation to this critica l issue which faces, and n ow slam s in the face of, our liv ing planet Gaia [S han]. W hat stands out in neon when reviewing all of the treat ises on the subject of po pulation is the total abse nce of God. That' s right, God. He is never m entioned - never included in the equation for hope and resolution. We know that God has a Plan 2000 too, yet som ehow even saying this sounds trite, like som e born-again com eback. But those who KNOW God, know that God' s Plan is so far o ut of m an's reach of understand ing that its m agnificen ce will shin e as the noonday sun. Instead of hope and inclusion of God into the equation for balance, we are presen ted with im ages of teem ing m asses who, like lemm ings, m ove en m asse toward their destination in a given mom ent. Always the conclusions are the sam e - re duce growth and depopulate or face ruin. W ell, we can be sure that thanks to places such as Porton Down, England; Fort Detrick, Maryland; and the W orld Health Organization, the tools for deat h and destruction are locked and loaded and dispensed to the sleeping innocents in Third W orld countries where trusting eyes look up to those giving the injections and say in their native tongue, \"T hank you\" as the countdown to their own death begins. Have I intended for this series to be depressing fear-m ongering? Far from it. I went into this series entirely \"open\" to find whatever the evidence pres ented to m e, and I believe th e evidence by now is so overwhelm ing for even the greate st of skeptics that it is safe to say, \" They really are trying to kill us off!\" And the tools at their disposal cross al l boundaries and com e in such 118"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"divergent form s as: disease-carrying ticks and fleas , clouds of gas, contam inated drinking water, on-the-hoof transm ission through our m eat to out-and-out nuclear weapons. The agenda for depopulation is right on track and accelerating rapidly. And, so t oo, the subject is so big, so overwhelm ing in scope, that m ost simply resign th em selves and throw their hands up in the air and say, \"There' s nothing I can do about it.\" It is no accident that CNN has recen tly run severa l specials o n the Ebola virus. The p ublic is being psych ologica lly p repared f or massive ou tbr eaks, and massive ou tbr eaks the re w ill b e. At this poin t in tim e, with all tha t has a lready been unleashed upon us, outbreaks are inevitab le . Those in power and control of this world do not know how to create , but they are extrem ely proficient at destruction and that is the path they are wa lking. They m ay m ake wondrous- sounding declarations about the ne ed to protect Mother Earth, such as you just read in Agenda 21 (which will effect everyone), but the cost in hum an lives will be without m easure. You will know by now that the issues confrontin g us as a planet are so co mplex, so in terwoven, that there are no easy answers. But who are Aurelio Pec cei , Eduard Pestel, Hugo Thiem ann, Carroll W ilson, Alexander King, Saburo Okita of the Club of Rom e to dictate to m ankind that thinning the m asses is required? I do not advocate violence, but there was a tim e in history when crim es of such high treason against hum anity were dealt with in a very precise m anner. At the very least, ones such as Club of Rom e me mbers should be called to answer before a W orld Court. But then, I suppose following this line of reasoning further, charges would have to include adm inistrators of such faciliti es as Porton Down, Fort Detric k, and perhap s even the World Health Organization itself. Obviously, in our present world, this isn' t going to happen. It is on ly th rough the selfless and co urageous efforts of such brillian t sch olars as Eustace Mullin s, Dr. Eva Snead, Dr. John Colem an, Robe rt Harris and Jerem y Paxan, to nam e just a few, that we are given the side of the story that allows for true understanding. Under the black cloak of national security all manner of evil lurks, waiting to rub out the very essence of souled life as we know it. For purposes of our discussion here, let' s take Louis Farrakhan' s m arch on W ashington. Most people knew and expected that there would be ma jor trouble, riots, rebe llion, and, to use Gary Wean' s phrase, initiated \"race rio ts and revolu tio n.\" And yet, what happen ed? Th e finest exam ple of peaceful assem bly ever witnes sed . And why was this m arch so succes sful? Becaus e God/Aton was included in the equation. He was the guiding force. His intervention was requested, in earnest, and He did intervene and it was nothing short of a m iracle. Let me just ask a s imple question : If God will interced e on b ehalf of those petitioni ng for peaceful assem bly, don' t you think He would intercede directly on behalf of preserving His own Creation if genuinely asked by souled beings everyw here in heartfelt pray er? Would He not send His Hosts to assist in resolution. But m an does not think of this and ma ny would say it is too late already. Well, with God, yea unto the m idnight hour, it is not too late. So, too, God HAS sent His Hosts in response to m an's petitio n for help. The help is co ming in many ways, but m ost notably in the form of THE W ORD, which m eans, knowledge.
