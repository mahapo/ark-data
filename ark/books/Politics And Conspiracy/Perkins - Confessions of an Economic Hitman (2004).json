They funnel money from the World Bank, th e U .S . Agency for International Development ( USAID) , and other foreign \"aid\" organizations into the coffers o f huge corporations and the pockets of a few wealthy fami- lies who control the planet's natural resources . Their tool s ince fraudulent financial reports, rigged elections , pay() s, extortion, sex, and murder . They play a game a s old as empire, but one that has taken on new and terrify- ing dimensions during this time of globalization . I should know ; I was an EHM . I wrote that in 1982, as the beginning of a book with the workin g title, Conscience of an Economic Hit Man . The book was dedicated t o the presidents of two countries, men who had been my clients , whom I respected and thought of as kindred spirits -- Jaime Roldos , president of Ecuador, and Omar Torrijos, president of Panama . Bot h had just died in fiery crashes . Their deaths were not accidental . The y were assassinated because they opposed that fraternity of corporate , government, and banking heads whose goal is global empire . W e EHMs failed to bring Roldos and Torrijos around, and the other typ e of hit men, the CIA-sanctioned jackals who were always right behin d us, stepped in . I was persuaded to stop writing that book . I started it four mor e times during the next twenty years . On each occasion, my decision t o begin again was influenced by current world events : the U .S . invasio n of Panama in 1989, the first Gulf War, Somalia, the rise of Osama bi n Laden . However, threats or bribes always con v inced me to stop . In 2003, the president of a major publishing house that is owne d by a powerful international corporation read a draft of what ha d now become Confessions of an Economic Hit Man . He described i t viii \t Confessions of an Economic Hit Man"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"as \"a riveting story that needs to be told .\" Then he smiled sadly , shook his head, and told me that since the executives at world head - quarters might object, he could not afford to risk publishing it . H e advised me to fictionalize it . \" We could market you in the mold of a novelist like John Le Carre or Graham Greene . \" But this is not fiction . It is the true story of my life . A more coura - geous publisher, one not owned by an international corporation, ha s agreed to help me tell it . This story must be told . We live in a time of terrible crisis — an d tremendous opportunity . The story of this particular economic hi t man is the story of how we got to where we are and why we currentl y face crises that seem insurmountable . This story must be told be - cause only by understanding our past mistakes will we be able t o take advantage of future opportunities ; because 9/11 happened an d so did the second war in Iraq ; because in addition to the three thou - sand people who died on September 11, 2001, at the hands of ter- rorists, another twenty-four thousand died from hunger and relate d causes . In fact, twenty-four thousand people die every single da y because they are unable to obtain life-sustaining food . i Most im- portantly, this story must be told because today, for the first time i n history, one nation has the ability, the money, and the power t o change all this . It is the nation where I was born and the one I serve d as an EHM : the United States of America . What finally convinced me to ignore the threats and bribes ? The short answer is that my only child, Jessica, graduated fro m college and went out into the world on her own . When I recentl y told her that I was considering publishing this book and shared m y fears with her, she said, \"Don't worry, dad . If they get you, I'll tak e over where you left off . We need to do this for the grandchildren I hope to give you someday!\" That is the short answer . The longer version relates to my dedication to the country wher e I was raised, to my love of the ideals expressed by our Founding Fa - thers, to my deep commitment to the American republic that toda y promises \"life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness\" for all people , everywhere, and to my determination after 9/11 not to sit idly by an y longer while EHMs turn that republic into a global empire . That i s the skeleton version of the long answer ; the flesh and blood ar e added in the chapters that follow . This is a true story . I lived every minute of it . The sights, the people, the conversations, and the feelings I describe were all a part of m y life . It is my personal story, and yet it happened within the large r context of world events that have shaped our history, have brough t us to where we are today, and form the foundation of our children' s futures . I have made every effort to present these experiences, people , and conversations accurately . Whenever I discuss historical event s or re-create conversations with other people, I do so with the help o f several tools : published documents ; personal records and notes ; rec - ollections — my own and those of others who participated ; the fiv e manuscripts I began previously ; and historical accounts by othe r authors, most notably recently published ones that disclose infor- mation that formerly was classified or otherwise unavailable . Refer- ences are provided in the endnotes, to allow interested readers t o pursue these subjects in more depth . In some cases, I combine sev- eral d'ggues I had with a person into one conversation to facilitat e the flow o the narrative . My publisher asked whether we actually referred to ourselves a s economic hit men . I assured him that we did, although usually onl y by the initials . In fact, on the day in 1971 when I began working wit h my teacher Claudine, she informed me, \"My assignment is to mol d you into an economic hit man . No one can know about your in- volvement — not even your wife?' Then she turned serious . \"Onc e you're in, you're in for life . \" Claudine's role is a fascinating example of the manipulation tha t underlies the business I had entered . Beautiful and intelligent, sh e was highly effective ; she understood my weaknesses and used the m to her greatest advantage . Her job and the way she executed it ex- emplify the subtlety of the people behind this system . Claudine pulled no punches when describing what I would b e called upon to do . My job, she said, was \"to encourage world leader s to become part of a vast network that promotes U .S . commercial in - terests . In the end, those leaders become ensnared in a web of deb t that ensures their loyalty . We can draw on them whenever we desir e — to satisfy our political, economic, or military needs . In turn, the y bolster their political positions by bringing industrial parks, powe r plants, and airports to their people . The owners of U .S . engineer- ing/construction companies become fabulously wealthy . \" Today we see the results of this system run amok .

The pharmaceutical industry denies lifesaving medicines t o millions of HIV-infected Africans . Twelve million families in ou r owm United States worry about their next meal . 2 The energy indus - try creates an Enron . The accounting industry creates an Andersen . The income ratio of the one-fifth of the world's population in th e wealthiest countries to the one-fifth in the poorest went from 30 to 1 in 1960 to 74 to 1 in 1995 . 3 The United States spends over $87 bil - lion conducting a war in Iraq while the United Nations estimate s that for less than half that amount we could provide clean water, ad - equate diets, sanitation services, and basic education to every perso n on the planet . 4 And we wonder why terrorists attack us ? Some would blame our current problems on an organized con- spiracy . I wish it were so simple . Members of a conspiracy can b e rooted out and brought to justice . This system, however, is fueled b y something far more dangerous than conspiracy . It is driven not by a small band of men but by a concept that has become accepted a s gospel : the idea that all economic growth benefits humankind an d that the greater the growth, the more widespread the benefits . Thi s belief also has a corollary : that those people who excel at stoking th e fires of economic growth should be exalted and rewarded, whil e those born at the fringes are available for exploitation . The concept is, of course, erroneous . We know that in many coun - tries economic growth benefits only a small portion of the popula- tion and may in fact result in increasingly desperate circumstance s for the majority . This effect is reinforced by the corollary belief tha t the captains of industry who drive this system should enjoy a specia l status, a belief that is the root of many of our current problems an d is perhaps also the reason why conspiracy theories abound . Whe n men and women are rewarded for greed, greed becomes a corrupt- ing motivator . When we equate the gluttonous consumption of th e earth's resources with a status approaching sainthood, when w e teach our children to emulate people who live unbalanced lives, an d when we define huge sections of the population as subservient to a n elite minority, we ask for trouble . And we get it . In their drive to advance the global empire, corporations, banks, and governments (collectively the corporatocracy) use their financia l and political muscle to ensure that our schools, businesses, and medi a support both the fallacious concept and its corollary . They hav e brought us to a point where our global culture is a monstrous ma - chine that requires exponentially increasing amounts of fuel an d maintenance, so much so that in the end it will have consume d everything in sight and will be left with no choice but to devour itself . The corporatocracy is not a conspiracy, but its members d o endorse common values and goals . One of corporatocracy's most im - portant functions is to perpetuate and continually expand an d strengthen the system . The lives of those who \"make it,\" and thei r accoutrements — their mansions, yachts, and private jets — are pre- sented as models to inspire us all to consume, consume, consume . Every opportunity is taken to convince us that purchasing things i s our civiN uty, that pillaging the earth is good for the economy an d therefore serves our higher interests . People like me are paid out- rageously high salaries to do the system's bidding . If we falter, a mor e malicious form of hit man, the jackal, steps to the plate . And if th e jackal fails, then the job falls to the military . This book is the confession of a man who, back when I was a n EHM, was part of a relatively small group . People who play simila r roles are more abundant now . They have more euphemistic titles , and they walk the corridors of Monsanto, General Electric, Nike , General Motors, Wal-Mart, and nearly every other major corpora - tion in the world . In a very real sense, Confessions of an Economi c Hit Man is their story as well as mine . It is your story too, the story of your world and mine, of the firs t truly global empire . History tells us that unless we modify this story , it is guaranteed to end tragically . Empires never last . Every one of the m has failed terribly . They destroy many cultures as they race towar d greater domination, and then they themselves fall . No country or com - bination of countries can thrive in the long term by exploiting others . This book was written so that we may take heed and remold ou r story . I am certain that when enough of us become aware of how w e are being exploited by the economic engine that creates an insatiabl e appetite for the world's resources, and results in systems that foste r slavery, we will no longer tolerate it . We will reassess our role in a world where a few swim in riches and the majority drown in poverty , pollution, and violence .

John Perkin s August 200 4 xiv Confessions of an Economic Hit Man \t Preface xv"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"PROLOGU E Quito, Ecuador's capital, stretches across a volcanic valley high i n the Andes, at an altitude of nine thousand feet . Residents of this city , which was founded long before Columbus arrived in the Americas , are accustomed to seeing snow on the surrounding peaks, despit e the fact that they live just a few miles south of the equator . The city of Shell, a frontier outpost and military base hacked ou t of Ecuador's Amazon jungle to service the oil company whose nam e it bears, is nearly eight thousand feet lower than Quito . A steamin g city, it is inhabited mostly by soldiers, oil workers, and the indige- nous people from the Shuar and Kichwa tribes who work for them a s prostitutes and laborers . To journey from one city to the other, you must travel a road tha t is both tortuous and breathtaking . Local people will tell you tha t during the trip you experience all four seasons in a single day . Although I have driven this road many times, I never tire of th e spectacular scenery . Sheer cliffs, punctuated by cascading waterfall s and brilliant bromeliads, rise up one side . On the other side, the eart h drops abruptly into a deep abyss where the Pastaza River, a head - water of the Amazon, snakes its way down the Andes . The Pastaz a carries water from the glaciers of Cotopaxi, one of the world's highes t active volcanoes and a deity in the time of the Incas, to the Atlanti c Ocean over three thousand miles away . In 2003, I departed Quito in a Subaru Outback and headed fo r Shell on a mission that was like no other I had ever accepted . I wa s hoping to end a war I had helped create . As is the case with so man y things we EHMs must take responsibility for, it is a war that is vir- tually unknown anywhere outside the country where it is fought . I was on my way to meet with the Shuars, the Kichwas, and thei r neighbors the Achuars, the Zaparos, and the Shiwiars—tribes de- termined to prevent our oil companies from destroying their homes , families, and lands, even if it means they must die in the process . Fo r them, this is a war about the survival of their children and cultures , while for us it is about power, money, and natural resources . It is one part of the struggle for world domination and the dream of a fe w greedy men, global empire . ' That is what we EHMs do best : we build a global empire . We ar e an elite group of men and women who utilize international financia l organizations to foment conditions that make other nations sub - servient to the corporatocracy running our biggest corporations, ou r government, and our banks . Like our counterparts in the Mafia , EHMs provide favors . These take the form of loans to develop in- frastructure — electric generating plants, highways, ports, airports , or industrial parks . A condition of such loans is that engineering an d construction companies from our own country must build all thes e projects . In essence, most of the money never leaves the Unite d States ; it is simply transferred from banking offices in Washington t o engineering offices in New York, Houston, or San Francisco . D to the fact that the money is returned almost immediatel y to torpor ions that are members of the corporatocracy (the credi- tor), the recipient country is required to pay it all back, principa l plus interest . If an EHM is completely successful, the loans are s o large that the debtor is forced to default on its payments after a fe w years . When this happens, then like the Mafia we demand our poun d of flesh . This often includes one or more of the following : contro l over United Nations votes, the installation of military bases, or acces s to precious resources such as oil or the Panama Canal . Of course, th e debtor still owes us the money—and another country is added t o our global empire . Driving from Quito toward Shell on this sunny day in 2003, I thought back thirty-five years to the first time I arrived in this par t of the world . I had read that although Ecuador is only about the siz e of Nevada, it has more than thirty active volcanoes, over 15 percen t of the world's bird species, and thousands of as-yet-unclassifie d plants, and that it is a land of diverse cultures where nearly as man y people speak ancient indigenous languages as speak Spanish . I found it fascinating and certainly exotic ; yet, the words that kep t coming to mind back then were pure, untouched, and innocent . Much has changed in thirty-five years . At the time of my first visit in 1968, Texaco had only just discov - ered petroleum in Ecuador's Amazon region . Today, oil accounts fo r nearly half the country's exports . A trans-Andean pipeline buil t shortly after my first visit has since leaked over a half million barrel s xvi \t Prologue xvii"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"of oil into the fragile rain forest — more than twice the amount spille d by the Exxon Valdez . 2 Today, a new 51 .3 billion, three hundred-mil e pipeline constructed by an EHM-organized consortium promises t o make Ecuador one of the worl d ' s top ten suppliers of oil to the Unite d States . 3 Vast areas of rain forest have fallen, macaws and jaguar s have all but vanished, three Ecuadorian indigenous cultures hav e been driven to the verge of collapse, and pristine rivers have bee n transformed into flaming cesspools . During this same period, the indigenous cultures began fightin g back . For instance, on May 7, 2003, a group of American lawyer s representing more than thirty thousand indigenous Ecuadoria n people filed a $1 billion lawsuit against ChevronTexaco Corp . Th e suit asserts that between 1971 and 1992 the oil giant dumped int o open holes and rivers over four million gallons per day of toxi c wastewater contaminated with oil, heavy metals, and carcinogens , and that the company left behind nearly 350 uncovered waste pit s that continue to kill both people and animals . 4 Outside the window of my Outback, great clouds of mist rolled i n from the forests and up the Pastaza's canyons . Sweat soaked my shirt , and my stomach began to churn, but not just from the intense trop- ical heat and the serpentine twists in the road . Knowing the part I had played in destroying this beautiful country' was once again takin g its toll . Because of my fellow EHMs and me, Ecuador is in far wors e shape today than she was before we introduced her to the miracles o f modern economics, banking, and engineering . Since 1970, durin g this period known euphemistically as the Oil Boom, the officia l poverty level grew from 50 to 70 percent, under- or unemploymen t increased from 15 to 70 percent, and public debt increased fro m $240 million to $16 billion . Meanwhile, the share of national resource s allocated to the poorest segments of the population declined fro m 20 to 6 percent . ' Unfortunately, Ecuador is not the exception . Nearly every countr y we EHMs have brought under the global empire's umbrella has suf - fered a similar fate . 6 Third world debt has grown to more than S2 . 5 trillion, and the cost of servicing it — over $375 billion per year as o f 2004 — is more than all third world spending on health and educa- tion, and twenty times what developing countries receive annually i n foreign aid . Over half the people in the world survive on less than tw o dollars per day, which is roughly the same amount they received in the early 1970s . Meanwhile, the top 1 percent of third worl d households accounts for 70 to 90 percent of all private financia l wealth and real estate ownership in their country ; the actual per- centage depends on the specific country ? The Subaru slowed as it meandered through the streets of th e beautiful resort town of Banos, famous for the hot baths created b y underground volcanic rivers that flow from the highly active Moun t Tungurahgua . Children ran along beside us, waving and trying t o sell us gum and cookies . Then we left Banos behind . The spectacu- lar scenery ended abruptly as the Subaru sped out of paradise an d into a modern vision of Dante's Inferno . A gigantic monster reared up from the river, a mammoth gra y wall . Its dripping concrete was totally out of place, completely un - natural and incompatible with the landscape . Of course, seeing i t there sgild not have surprised me . I knew all along that it would b e waiting in mbush . I had encountered it many times before and i n the past had praised it as a symbol of EHM accomplishments . Eve n so, it made my skin crawl . That hideous, incongruous wall is a dam that blocks the rushin g Pastaza River, diverts its waters through huge tunnels bored into th e mountain, and converts the energy to electricity . This is the 156 - megawatt Agoyan hydroelectric project . It fuels the industries tha t make a handful of Ecuadorian families wealthy, and it has been th e source of untold suffering for the farmers and indigenous peopl e who live along the river . This hydroelectric plant is just one of man y projects developed through my efforts and those of other EHMs . Such projects are the reason Ecuador is now a member of the globa l empire, and the reason why the Shuars and Kichwas and thei r neighbors threaten war against our oil companies . Because of EHM projects, Ecuador is awash in foreign debt an d must devote an inordinate share of its national budget to paying thi s off, instead of using its capital to help the millions of its citizen s officially classified as dangerously impoverished . The only way Ecua - dor can buy down its foreign obligations is by selling its rain forest s to the oil companies . Indeed, one of the reasons the EHMs set thei r sights on Ecuador in the first place was because the sea of oi l beneath its Amazon region is believed to rival the oil fields of th e Middle East . 8 The global empire demands its pound of flesh in th e form of oil concessions . xviii \t Confessions of an Economic Hit Man \t Prologue xix"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"These demands became especially urgent after September 11 , 2001, when Washington feared that Middle Eastern supplies migh t cease . On top of that, Venezuela, our third-largest oil supplier, ha d recently elected a populist president, Hugo Chavez, who took a strong stand against what he referred to as U .S . imperialism ; h e threatened to cut off oil sales to the United States . The EHMs ha d failed in Iraq and Venezuela, but we had succeeded in Ecuador ; no w we would milk it for all it is worth . Ecuador is typical of countries around the world that EHMs hav e brought into the economic-political fold . For every $100 of crud e taken out of the Ecuadorian rain forests, the oil companies receiv e $75 . Of the remaining S25, three-quarters must go to paying off th e foreign debt . Most of the remainder covers military and other gov- ernment expenses — which leaves about $2 .50 for health, education , and programs aimed at helping the poor . 9 Thus, out of every $10 0 worth of oil torn from the Amazon, less than $3 goes to the peopl e who need the money most, those whose lives have been so adversel y impacted by the dams, the drilling, and the pipelines, and who ar e dying from lack of edible food and potable water . All of those people—millions in Ecuador, billions around th e planet—are potential terrorists . Not because they believe in com- munism or anarchism or are intrinsically evil, but simply becaus e they are desperate . Looking at this dam, I wondered —as I have s o often in so many places around the world—when these peopl e would take action, like the Americans against England in the 1770 s or Latin Americans against Spain in the early 1800s . The subtlety of this modern empire building puts the Roma n centurions, the Spanish conquistadors, and the eighteenth- an d nineteenth-century European colonial powers to shame . We EHM s are crafty ; we learned from history . Today we do not carry swords . We do not wear armor or clothes that set us apart . In countries lik e Ecuador, Nigeria, and Indonesia, we dress like local schoolteacher s and shop owners . In Washington and Paris, we look like governmen t bureaucrats and bankers .

I was an only child, born into the middle class in 1945 . Both m y parents came from three centuries of New England Yankee stock ; their strict, moralistic, staunchly Republican attitudes reflecte d generations of puritanical ancestors . They were the first in their fam - ilies to attend college — on scholarships . My mother became a hig h school Latin teacher . My father joined World War II as a Navy lieu - tenant and was in charge of the armed guard gun crew on a highl y flammable merchant marine tanker in the Atlantic . When I wa s born, in Hanover, New Hampshire, he was recuperating from a bro - ken hip in a Texas hospital . I did not see him until I was a year old . He took a job teaching languages at Tilton School, a boys' board - ing school in rural New Hampshire . The campus stood high on a hill, proudly—some would say arrogantly—towering over the tow n of the same name . This exclusive institution limited its enrollment t o about fifty students in each grade level, nine through twelve . Th e students were mostly the scions of wealthy families from Bueno s Aires, Caracas, Boston, and New York . My family was cash starved ; however, we most certainly did no t see ourselves as poor . Although the school's teachers received ver y little salary, all our needs were provided free : food, housing, heat , water, and the workers who mowed our lawn and shoveled our snow . Beginning on my fourth birthday, I ate in the prep school dinin g 3"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"room, shagged balls for the soccer teams my dad coached, an d handed out towels in the locker room . It is an understatement to say that the teachers and their wive s felt superior to the locals . I used to hear my parents joking about be- ing the lords of the manor, ruling over the lowly peasants — th e townies . I knew it was more than a joke . My elementary and middle school friends belonged to that peasan t class ; they were very poor . Their parents were dirt farmers, lumber - jacks, and mill workers . They resented \"the preppies on the hill,\" an d in turn, my father and mother discouraged me from socializing wit h the townie girls, who they called \"tarts\" and \"sluts .\" I had share d schoolbooks and crayons with these girls since first grade, and ove r the years, I fell in love with three of them : Ann, Priscilla, and Judy . I had a hard time understanding my parents' perspective ; however , I deferred to their wishes . Every year we spent the three months of my dad's summer vacatio n at a lake cottage built by my grandfather in 1921 . It was surrounde d by forests, and at night we could hear owls and mountain lions . W e had no neighbors ; I was the only child within walking distance . I n the early years, I passed the days by pretending that the trees wer e knights of the Round Table and damsels in distress named Ann , Priscilla, or Judy (depending on the year) . My passion was, I had n o doubt, as strong as that of Lancelot for Guinevere — and even mor e secretive . At fourteen, I received free tuition to Tilton School . With my par- ents' prodding, I rejected everything to do with the town and neve r saw my old friends again . When my new classmates went home t o their mansions and penthouses for vacation, I remained alone on th e hill . Their girlfriends were debutantes ; I had no girlfriends . All the girl s I knew were \"sluts\" ; I had cast them off, and they had forgotten me . I was alone — and terribly frustrated . My parents were masters at manipulation ; they assured me tha t I was privileged to have such an opportunity and that some day I would be grateful . I would find the perfect wife, one suited to ou r high moral standards . Inside, though, I seethed . I craved female com - panionship — sex ; the idea of a slut was most alluring . However, rather than rebelling, I repressed my rage and expresse d my frustration by excelling . I was an honor student, captain of tw o varsity teams, editor of the school newspaper . I was determined to show up my rich classmates and to leave Tilton behind forever . Dur- ing my senior year, I was awarded a full athletic scholarship to Brow n and an academic scholarship to Middlebury . I chose Brown, mainl y because I preferred being an athlete — and because it was located i n a city . My mother had graduated from Middlebury and my fathe r had received his master's degree there, so even though Brown was i n the Ivy League, they preferred Middlebury . \"What if you break your leg?\" my father asked . \"Better to take th e academic scholarship .\" I buckled . Middlebury was, in my perception, merely an inflated version o f Tilton — albeit in rural Vermont instead of rural New Hampshire . True, it was coed, but I was poor and most everyone else was wealthy , and I had not attended school with a female in four years . I lacke d confidence, felt outclassed, was miserable . I pleaded with my dad t o let me drop out or take a year off . I wanted to move to Boston an d learn about life and women . He would not hear of it . \"How can I pre - tend to prepare other parents' kids for college if my own won't sta y in one?\" he asked . I have come to understand that life is composed of a series o f coincidences . How we react to these—how we exercise what som e refer to as free will — is everything ; the choices we make within th e boundaries of the twists of fate determine who we are . Two majo r coincidences that shaped my life occurred at Middlebury One cam e in the form of an Iranian, the son of a general who was a persona l advisor to the shah ; the other was a beautiful young woman name d Ann, like my childhood sweetheart . The first, whom I will call Farhad, had played professional socce r in Rome . He was endowed with an athletic physique, curly blac k hair, soft walnut eyes, and a background and charisma that mad e him irresistible to women . He was my opposite in many ways . I worked hard to win his friendship, and he taught me many thing s that would serve me well in the years to come . I also met Ann . Al - though she was seriously dating a young man who attended anothe r college, she took me under her wing . Our platonic relationship wa s the first truly loving one I had ever experienced . Farhad encouraged me to drink, party, and ignore my parents . I consciously chose to stop studying . I decided I would break my aca- demic leg to get even with my father . My grades plummeted ; I los t my scholarship . Halfway through my sophomore year, I elected t o 4 Part I : 1963—1971 \t An Economic Hit Man Is Born 5"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"drop out . My father threatened to disown me ; Farhad egged me on . I stormed into the dean's office and quit school . It was a pivotal mo - ment in my life . Farhad and I celebrated my last night in town together at a loca l bar . A drunken farmer, a giant of a man, accused me of flirting wit h his wife, picked me up off my feet, and hurled me against a wall . Farhad stepped between us, drew a knife, and slashed the farme r open at the cheek . Then he dragged me across the room and shove d me through a window, out onto a ledge high above Otter Creek . W e jumped and made our way along the river and back to our dorm . The next morning, when interrogated by the campus police, I lie d and refused to admit any knowledge of the incident . Nevertheless , Farhad was expelled . We both moved to Boston and shared an apart - ment there . I landed a job at Hearst's RecordAmerican/SundayAd- vertiser newspapers, as a personal assistant to the editor in chief o f the Sunday Advertiser . Later that year, 1965, several of my friends at the newspaper wer e drafted . To avoid a similar fate, I entered Boston University's Colleg e of Business Administration . By then, Ann had broken up with he r old boyfriend, and she often traveled down from Middlebury to visit . I welcomed her attention . She graduated in 1967, while I still ha d another year to complete at BU . She adamantly refused to move i n with me until we were married . Although I joked about being black - mailed, and in fact did resent what I saw as a continuation of m y parents' archaic and prudish set of moral standards, I enjoyed ou r times together and I wanted more . We married . Ann's father, a brilliant engineer, had masterminded the naviga- tional system for an important class of missile and was rewarde d with a high-level position in the Department of the Navy . His bes t friend, a man Ann called Uncle Frank (not his real name), was em- ployed as an executive at the highest echelons of the National Secu - rity Agency (NSA), the country's least-known — and by most account s largest — spy organization . Shortly after our marriage, the military summoned me for m y physical . I passed and therefore faced the prospect of Vietnam upo n graduation . The idea of fighting in Southeast Asia tore me apar t emotionally, though war has always fascinated me . I was raised o n tales about my colonial ancestors — who include Thomas Paine an d Ethan Allen — and I had visited all the New England and upstate New York battle sites of both the French and Indian and the Revo- lutionary wars . I read every historical novel I could find . In fact , when Army Special Forces units first entered Southeast Asia, I wa s eager to sign up . But as the media exposed the atrocities and the in - consistencies of U .S . policy, I experienced a change of heart . I foun d myself wondering whose side Paine would have taken . I was sure h e would have joined our Vietcong enemies . Uncle Frank came to my rescue . He informed me that an NSA jo b made one eligible for draft deferment, and he arranged for a series o f meetings at his agency, including a day of grueling polygraph - monitored interviews . I was told that these tests would determin e whether I was suitable material for NSA recruitment and training , and if I was, would provide a profile of my strengths and weaknesses , which would be used to map out my career . Given my attitude to - ward the Vietnam War, I was convinced I would fail the tests . Under examination, I admitted that as a loyal American I op - posed the war, and I was surprised when the interviewers did no t pursue this subject . Instead, they focused on my upbringing, m y attitudes toward my parents, the emotions generated by the fact I grew up as a poor puritan among so many wealthy, hedonistic prep - pies . They also explored my frustration about the lack of women, sex , and money in my life, and the fantasy world that had evolved as a re - sult . I was amazed by the attention they gave to my relationship wit h Farhad and by their interest in my willingness to lie to the campu s police to protect him . At first I assumed all these things that seemed so negative to m e marked me as an NSA reject, but the interviews continued, suggest - ing otherwise . It was not until several years later that I realized tha t from an NSA viewpoint these negatives actually are positive . Thei r assessment had less to do with issues of loyalty to my country tha n with the frustrations of my life . Anger at my parer ; .,, an obsessio n with women, and my ambition to live the good life gave them a hook ; I was seducible . My determination to excel in school and i n sports, my ultimate rebellion against my father, my ability to ge t along with foreigners, and my willingness to lie to the police wer e exactly the types of attributes they sought . I also discovered, later , that Farhad's father worked for the U .S . intelligence community i n Iran ; my friendship with Farhad was therefore a definite plus . A few weeks after the NSA testing, I was offered a job to star t 6 Part I : 1963—1971 \t An Economic Hit Man Is Born 7"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"training in the art of spying, to begin after I received my degree fro m BU several months later . However, before I had officially accepte d this offer, I impulsively attended a seminar given at BU by a Peac e Corps recruiter . A major selling point was that, like the NSA, Peac e Corps jobs made one eligible for draft deferments . The decision to sit in on that seminar was one of those coincidence s that seemed insignificant at the time but turned out to have life - changing implications . The recruiter described several places i n the world that especially needed volunteers . One of these was th e Amazon rain forest where, he pointed out, indigenous people live d very much as natives of North America had until the arrival o f Europeans . I had always dreamed of living like the Abnakis who inhabite d New Hampshire when my ancestors first settled there . I knew I ha d Abnaki blood in my veins, and I wanted to learn the type of fores t lore they understood so well . I approached the recruiter after his tal k and asked about the possibility of being assigned to the Amazon . H e assured me there was a great need for volunteers in that region an d that my chances would be excellent . I called Uncle Frank . To my surprise, Uncle Frank encouraged me to consider the Peac e Corps . He confided that after the fall of Hanoi — which in those day s was deemed a certainty by men in his position—the Amazo n would become a hot spot . \"Loaded with oil,\" he said . \"We'll need good agents there — peopl e who understand the natives .\" He assured me that the Peace Corp s would be an excellent training ground, and he urged me to becom e proficient in Spanish as well as in local indigenous dialects . \"Yo u might,\" he chuckled, \"end up working for a private company instea d of the government . \" I did not understand what he meant by that at the time . I was be - ing upgraded from spy to EHM, although I had never heard th e term and would not for a few more years . I had no idea that ther e were hundreds of men and women scattered around the world , working for consulting firms and other private companies, peopl e who never received a penny of salary from any government agenc y and yet were serving the interests of empire . Nor could I hav e guessed that a new type, with more euphemistic titles, would num- ber in the thousands by the end of the millennium, and that I woul d play a significant role in shaping this growing army . Ann and I applied to the Peace Corps and requested an assign- ment in the Amazon . When our acceptance notification arrived, m y first reaction was one of extreme disappointment . The letter state d that we would be sent to Ecuador . Oh no, I thought . I requested the Amazon, not Africa . I went to an atlas and looked up Ecuador . I was dismayed whe n I could not find it anywhere on the African continent . In the index , though, I discovered that it is indeed located in Latin America, an d I saw on the map that the river systems flowing off its Andean gla- ciers form the headwaters to the mighty Amazon . Further readin g assured me that Ecuador's jungles were some of the world's most di - verse and formidable, and that the indigenous people still live d much as they had for millennia . We accepted . Ann and I completed Peace Corps training in Southern Californi a and headed for Ecuador in September 1968 . We lived in the Amazo n with the Shuar whose lifestyle did indeed resemble that of precolo- nial North American natives ; we also worked in the Andes with de- scendants of the Incas . It was a side of the world I never dreame d still existed . Until then, the only Latin Americans I had met were th e wealthy preppies at the school where my father taught . I found my - self sympathizing with these indigenous people who subsisted o n hunting and farming . I felt an odd sort of kinship with them . Somehow, they reminded me of the townies I had left behind . One day a man in a business suit, Einar Greve, landed at th e airstrip in our community . He was a vice president at Chas . T . Main , Inc . (MAIN), an international consulting firm that kept a very lo w profile and that was in charge of studies to determine whether th e World Bank should lend Ecuador and its neighboring countries bil- lions of dollars to build hydroelectric dams and other infrastructur e projects . Einar also was a colonel in the U .S . Army Reserve . He started talking with me about the benefits of working for a company like MAIN . When I mentioned that I had been accepted b y the NSA before joining the Peace Corps, and that I was considerin g going back to them, he informed me that he sometimes acted as a n NSA liaison ; he gave me a look that made me suspect that part of hi s assignment was to evaluate my capabilities . I now believe that h e was updating my profile, and especially sizing up my abilities to sur- vive in environments most North Americans would find hostile . We spent a couple of days together in Ecuador, and afterwar d 8 Part I : 1963—1971 \t An Economic Hit Man Is Born 9"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"communicated by mail . He asked me to send him reports assessin g Ecuador ' s economic prospects . I had a small portable typewriter , loved to write, and was quite happy to comply with this request . Over a period of about a year, I sent Einar at least fifteen long letters . In these letters, I speculated on Ecuador's economic and politica l future, and I appraised the growing frustration among the indigenou s communities as they struggled to confront oil companies, interna- tional development agencies, and other attempts to draw them int o the modern world . When my Peace Corps tour was over, Einar invited me to a jo b interview at MAIN headquarters in Boston . During our private meet - ing, he emphasized that MAIN's primary business was engineerin g but that his biggest client, the World Bank, recently had begun in- sisting that he keep economists on staff to produce the critical eco- nomic forecasts used to determine the feasibility and magnitude o f engineering projects . He confided that he had previously hired thre e highly qualified economists with impeccable credentials — two wit h master's degrees and one with a PhD . They had failed miserably . \"None of them,\" Einar said, \"can handle the idea of producin g economic forecasts in countries where reliable statistics aren't avail - able .\" He went on to tell me that, in addition, all of them had foun d it impossible to fulfill the terms of their contracts, which require d them to travel to remote places in countries like Ecuador, Indonesia , Iran, and Egypt, to interview local leaders, and to provide persona l assessments about the prospects for economic development i n those regions . One had suffered a nervous breakdown in an isolate d Panamanian village ; he was escorted by Panamanian police to th e airport and put on a plane back to the United States . \"The letters you sent me indicate that you don't mind stickin g your neck out, even when hard data isn't available . And given you r living conditions in Ecuador, I'm confident you can survive almos t anywhere .\" He told me that he already had fired one of those econ- omists and was prepared to do the same with the other two, if I accepted the job . So it was that in January 1971 I was offered a position as an econ - omist with MAIN . I had turned twenty-six — the magical age whe n the draft board no longer wanted me . I consulted with Ann's family ; they encouraged me to take the job, and I assumed this reflected Un- cle Frank's attitude as well . I recalled him mentioning the possibility I would end up working for a private firm . Nothing was ever state d openly, but I had no doubt that my employment at MAIN was a con - sequence of the arrangements Uncle Frank had made three year s earlier, in addition to my experiences in Ecuador and my willingnes s to write about that country's economic and political situation . My head reeled for several weeks, and I had a very swollen ego . I had earned only a bachelor's degree from BU, which did not seem t o warrant a position as an economist with such a lofty consulting com- pany I knew that many of my BU classmates who had been rejecte d by the draft and had gone on to earn MBAs and other graduate de- grees would be overcome with jealousy I visualized myself as a dash - ing secret agent, heading off to exotic lands, lounging beside hote l swimming pools, surrounded by gorgeous bikini-clad women, mar- tini in hand . Although this was merely fantasy, I would discover that it held el - ements of truth . Einar had hired me as an economist, but I was soo n to learn that my real job went far beyond that, and that it was in fac t closer to James Bond's than I ever could have guessed . 10 Part I : 1963—1971 \t An Economic Hit Man Is Born 11"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"1S . CHAPTER 2 \"In for Life \" In legal parlance, MAIN would be called a closely held corporation ; roughly 5 percent of its two thousand employees owned the company . These were referred to as partners or associates, and their positio n was coveted . Not only did the partners have power over everyon e else, but also they made the big bucks . Discretion was their hallmark ; they dealt with heads of state and other chief executive officers wh o expect their consultants, like their attorneys and psychotherapists, t o honor a strict code of absolute confidentiality . Talking with the pres s was taboo . It simply was not tolerated . As a consequence, hardly any - one outside MAIN had ever heard of us, although many were famil- iar with our competitors, such as Arthur D . Little, Stone & Webster , Brown & Root, Halliburton, and Bechtel . I use the term competitors loosely, because in fact MAIN was in a league by itself . The majority of our professional staff was engineers , yet we owned no equipment and never constructed so much as a storage shed . Many MAINers were ex-military ; however, we did no t contract with the Department of Defense or with any of the militar y services . Our stock-in-trade was something so different from th e norm that during my first months there even I could not figure ou t what we did . I knew only that my first real assignment would be i n Indonesia, and that I would be part of an eleven-man team sent t o create a master energy plan for the island of Java . I also knew that Einar and others who discussed the job with m e were eager to convince me that Java's economy would boom, and that if I wanted to distinguish myself as a good forecaster (and t o therefore be offered promotions), I would produce projections tha t demonstrated as much . \"Right off the chart,\" Einar liked to say . He would glide his finger s through the air and up over his head . \"An economy that will soar lik e a bird! \" Einar took frequent trips that usually lasted only two to thre e days . No one talked much about them or seemed to know where h e had gone . When he was in the office, he often invited me to sit wit h him for a few minutes over coffee . He asked about Ann, our ne w apartment, and the cat we had brought with us from Ecuador . I gre w bolder as I came to know him better, and I tried to learn more abou t him and what I would be expected to do in my job . But I never re- ceived answers that satisfied me ; he was a master at turning con- versations around . On one such occasion, he gave me a peculiar look . \"You needn't worry,\" he said . \"We have high expectations for you . I was in Washington recently . . .\" His voice trailed off and he smile d inscrutably . \"In any case, you know we have a big project in Kuwait . It'll be a while before you leave for Indonesia . I think you should us e some of your time to read up on Kuwait . The Boston Public Librar y is a great resource, and we can get you passes to the MIT and Harvar d libraries . \" After that, I spent many hours in those libraries, especially in th e BPL, which was located a few blocks away from the office and ver y close to my Back Bay apartment . I became familiar with Kuwait as wel l as with many books on economic statistics, published by the Unite d Nations, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the Worl d Bank . I knew that I would be expected to produce econometric mod - els for Indonesia and Java, and I decided that I might as well ge t started by doing one for Kuwait . However, my BS in business administration had not prepared m e as an econometrician, so I spent a lot of time trying to figure out ho w to go about it . I went so far as to enroll in a couple of courses on th e subject . In the process, I discovered that statistics can be manipu- lated to produce a large array of conclusions, including those sub- stantiating the predilections of the analyst . MAIN was a macho corporation . There were only four wome n who held professional positions in 1971 . However, there were per- haps two hundred women divided between the cadres of persona l 12 \t \" In for Life \" \t 13"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"secretaries — every vice president and department manager ha d one — and the steno pool, which served the rest of us . I had becom e accustomed to this gender bias, and I was therefore especially as- tounded by what happened one day in the BPL ' s reference section . An attractive brunette woman came up and sat in a chair acros s the table from me . In her dark green business suit, she looked ver y sophisticated . I judged her to be several years my senior, but I trie d to focus on not noticing her, on acting indifferent . After a few min- utes, without a word, she slid an open book in my direction . It con- tained a table with information I had been searching for abou t Kuwait — and a card with her name, Claudine Martin, and her title , Special Consultant to Chas . T . Main, Inc . I looked up into her sof t green eyes, and she extended her hand . `\"I've been asked to help in your training,\" she said . I could not be - lieve this was happening to me . Beginning the next day, we met in Claudine's Beacon Stree t apartment, a few blocks from MAIN's Prudential Center headquar- ters . During our first hour together, she explained that my positio n was an unusual one and that we needed to keep everything highl y confidential . She told me that no one had given me specifics abou t my job because no one was authorized to — except her . Then she in - formed me that her assignment was to mold me into an economi c hit man . The very name awakened old cloak-and-dagger dreams . I wa s embarrassed by the nervous laughter I heard coming from me . Sh e smiled and assured me that humor was one of the reasons they use d the term . \"Who would take it seriously?\" she asked . I confessed ignorance about the role of economic hit men . \"You're not alone,\" she laughed . \"We're a rare breed, in a dirt y business . No one can know about your involvement — not even you r wife :' Then she turned serious . \"I'll be very frank with you, teach yo u all I can during the next weeks . Then you'll have to choose . Your de- cision is final . Once you're in, you're in for life .\" After that, she sel- dom used the full name ; we were simply EHMs . I know now what I did not then — that Claudine took full advantag e of the personality weaknesses the NSA profile had disclosed abou t me . I do not know who supplied her with the information — Einar, th e NSA, MAIN's personnel department, or someone else — only tha t she used it masterfully . Her approach, a combination of physical seduction and verbal manipulation, was tailored specifically for me , and yet it fit within the standard operating procedures I have sinc e seen used by a variety of businesses when the stakes are high and th e pressure to close lucrative deals is great . She knew from the star t that I would not jeopardize my marriage by disclosing our clandes- tine activities . And she was brutally frank when it came to describ- ing the shadowy side of things that would he expected of me . I have no idea who paid her salary, although I have no reason t o suspect it was not, as her business card implied, MAIN . At the time , I was too naive, intimidated, and bedazzled to ask the questions tha t today seem so obvious . Claudine told me that there were two primary objectives of m y work . First, I was to justify huge international loans that would funne l money back to MAIN and other U .S . companies (such as Bechtel , Halliburton, Stone & Webster, and Brown & Root) through massiv e engineering and construction projects . Second, I would work t o bankrupt the countries that received those loans (after they had pai d MAIN and the other U .S . contractors, of course) so that they woul d be forever beholden to their creditors, and so they would presen t easy targets when we needed favors, including military bases, U N votes, or access to oil and other natural resources . My job, she said, was to forecast the effects of investing billions o f dollars in a country . Specifically, I would produce studies that pro- jected economic growth twenty to twenty-five years into the futur e and that evaluated the impacts of a variety of projects . For example , if a decision was made to lend a country $1 billion to persuade it s leaders not to align with the Soviet Union, I would compare the ben- efits of investing that money in power plants with the benefits of in - vesting in a new national railroad network or a telecommunication s system . Or I might be told that the country was being offered the op- portunity to receive a modern electric utility system, and it would b e up to me to demonstrate that such a system would result in sufficien t economic growth to justify the loan . The critical factor, in every case , was gross national product . The project that resulted in the highes t average annual growth of GNP won . If only one project was unde r consideration, I would need to demonstrate that developing i t would bring superior benefits to the GNP . The unspoken aspect of every one of these projects was that the y were intended to create large profits for the contractors, and to mak e 14 \t Part I : 1963-1971 \t \" In for Life \" \t 15"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"a handful of wealthy and influential families in the receiving coun- tries very happy ; while assuring the long-term financial dependenc e and therefore the political loyalty of governments around th e world . The larger the loan, the better . The fact that the debt burde n placed on a country would deprive its poorest citizens of health, ed- ucation, and other social services for decades to come was not take n into consideration . Claudine and I openly discussed the deceptive nature of GNP . Fo r instance, the growth of GNP may result even when it profits only on e person, such as an individual who owns a utility company, and eve n if the majority of the population is burdened with debt . The rich ge t richer and the poor grow poorer . Yet, from a statistical standpoint , this is recorded as economic progress . Like U .S . citizens in general, most MAIN employees believed w e were doing countries favors when we built power plants, highways , and ports . Our schools and our press have taught us to perceive all o f our actions as altruistic . Over the years, I've repeatedly heard com- ments like, \"If they're going to burn the U .S . flag and demonstrat e against our embassy, why don't we just get out of their damn coun- try and let them wallow in their own poverty? \" People who say such things often hold diplomas certifying tha t they are well educated . However, these people have no clue that th e main reason we establish embassies around the world is to serve ou r own interests, which during the last half of the twentieth centur y meant turning the American republic into a global empire . Despit e credentials, such people are as uneducated as those eighteenth - century colonists who believed that the Indians fighting to defen d their lands were servants of the devil . Within several months, I would leave for the island of Java in th e country of Indonesia, described at that time as the most heavily pop- ulated piece of real estate on the planet . Indonesia also happened t o be an oil-rich Muslim nation and a hotbed of communist activity . \"It's the next domino after Vietnam,\" is the way Claudine put it . \"We must win the Indonesians over . If they join the Communis t bloc, well . . .\" She drew a finger across her throat and then smile d sweetly . \"Let's just say you need to come up with a very optimisti c forecast of the economy, how it will mushroom after all the new powe r plants and distribution lines are built . That will allow USAID an d the international banks to justify the loans . You'll be well rewarded, of course, and can move on to other projects in exotic places . Th e world is your shopping cart . \" She went on to warn me that my rol e would be tough . \" Experts at the banks will come after you . It's thei r job to punch holes in your forecasts — that ' s what they ' re paid to do . Making you look bad makes them look good . \" One day I reminded Claudine that the MAIN team being sent t o Java included ten other men . I asked if they all were receiving th e same type of training as me . She assured me they were not . \"They're engineers,\" she said . \"They design power plants, trans - mission and distribution lines, and seaports and roads to bring i n the fuel . You're the one who predicts the future . Your forecasts de- termine the magnitude of the systems they design — and the size o f the loans . You see, you're the key . \" Every time I walked away from Claudine's apartment, I wondere d whether I was doing the right thing . Somewhere in my heart, I sus- pected I was not . But the frustrations of my past haunted me . MAI N seemed to offer everything my life had lacked, and yet I kept askin g myself if Tom Paine would have approved . In the end, I convince d myself that by learning more, by experiencing it, I could better ex - pose it later —the old \"working from the inside\" justification . When I shared this idea with Claudine, she gave me a perplexe d look . \"Don't be ridiculous . Once you're in, you can never get out . Yo u must decide for yourself, before you get in any deeper .\" I understoo d her, and what she said frightened me . After I left, I strolled dow n Commonwealth Avenue, turned onto Dartmouth Street, and assure d myself that I was the exception . One afternoon some months later, Claudine and I sat in a win- dow settee watching the snow fall on Beacon Street . `We're a small , exclusive club,\" she said . \"We're paid — well paid — to cheat countrie s around the globe out of billions of dollars . A large part of your job i s to encourage world leaders to become part of a vast network tha t promotes U .S . commercial interests . In the end, those leaders be - come ensnared in a web of debt that ensures their loyalty . We ca n draw on them whenever we desire — to satisfy our political, economic , or military needs . In turn, these leaders bolster their political posi- tions by bringing industrial parks, power plants, and airports t o their people . Meanwhile, the owners of U .S . engineering and con- struction companies become very wealthy . \" That afternoon, in the idyllic setting of Claudine's apartment , 16 \t Part I : 1963—1971 \t \"In for Life \" \t 17"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"relaxing in the window while snow swirled around outside, I learne d the history of the profession I was about to enter . Claudine describe d how throughout most of history, empires were built largely throug h military force or the threat of it . But with the end of World War II , the emergence of the Soviet Union, and the specter of nuclear holo- caust, the military solution became just too risky . The decisive moment occurred in 1951, when Iran rebelled agains t a British oil company that was exploiting Iranian natural resource s and its people . The company was the forerunner of British Petroleum , today's BP . In response, the highly popular, democratically electe d Iranian prime minister (and TIME magazine's Man of the Year i n 1951), Mohammad Mossadegh, nationalized all Iranian petroleu m assets . An outraged England sought the help of her World War I I ally, the United States . However, both countries feared that militar y retaliation would provoke the Soviet Union into taking action on be - half of Iran . Instead of sending in the Marines, therefore, Washington dis- patched CIA agent Kermit Roosevelt (Theodore's grandson) . He per - formed brilliantly, winning people over through payoffs and threats . He then enlisted them to organize a series of street riots and violen t demonstrations, which created the impression that Mossadegh wa s both unpopular and inept . In the end, Mossadegh went down, an d he spent the rest of his life under house arrest . The pro-America n Mohammad Reza Shah became the unchallenged dictator . Kermi t Roosevelt had set the stage for a new profession, the one whose rank s I was joining . ' Roosevelt's gambit reshaped Middle Eastern history even as i t rendered obsolete all the old strategies for empire building . It als o coincided with the beginning of experiments in \"limited nonnuclea r military actions,\" which ultimately resulted in U .S . humiliations i n Korea and Vietnam . By 1968, the year I interviewed with the NSA , it had become clear that if the United States wanted to realiz e its dream of global empire (as envisioned by men like president s Johnson and Nixon), it would have to employ strategies modeled o n Roosevelt's Iranian example . This was the only way to beat th e Soviets without the threat of nuclear war . There was one problem, however . Kermit Roosevelt was a CI A employee . Had he been caught, the consequences would have bee n dire . He had orchestrated the first U .S . operation to overthrow a foreign government, and it was likely that many more would follow , but it was important to find an approach that would not directly im- plicate Washington . Fortunately for the strategists, the 1960s also witnessed anothe r type of revolution : the empowerment of international corporation s and of multinational organizations such as the World Bank and th e IMF . The latter were financed primarily by the United States an d our sister empire builders in Europe . A symbiotic relationship de- veloped between governments, corporations, and multinational or- ganizations . By the time I enrolled in BU's business school, a solution to th e Roosevelt-as-CIA-agent problem had already been worked out . U .S . intelligence agencies — including the NSA — would identify prospec - tive EHMs, who could then be hired by international corporations . These EHMs would never be paid by the government ; instead, the y would draw their salaries from the private sector . As a result, thei r dirty work, if exposed, would be chalked up to corporate gree d rather than to government policy . In addition, the corporations tha t hired them, although paid by government agencies and their multi - national banking counterparts (with taxpayer money), would be in- sulated from congressional oversight and public scrutiny, shielde d by a growing body of legal initiatives, including trademark, interna - tional trade, and Freedom of Information laws . 2 \"So you see,\" Claudine concluded, \" we are just the next generatio n in a proud tradition that began back when you were in first grade . \" 18 \t Part I : 1963—1971 \t \" In for Life' \" \t 19"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"ana CHAPTER 3 Indonesia : Lessons for an EH M In addition to learning about my new career, I also spent time read - ing books about Indonesia . \"The more you know about a country be - fore you get there, the easier your job will be,\" Claudine had advised . I took her words to heart . When Columbus set sail in 1492, he was trying to reach Indonesia , known at the time as the Spice Islands . Throughout the colonia l era, it was considered a treasure worth far more than the Americas . Java, with its rich fabrics, fabled spices, and opulent kingdoms, wa s both the crown jewel and the scene of violent clashes between Span - ish, Dutch, Portuguese, and British adventurers . The Netherland s emerged triumphant in 1750, but even though the Dutch controlle d Java, it took them more than 150 years to subdue the outer islands . When the Japanese invaded Indonesia during World War II , Dutch forces offered little resistance . As a result, Indonesians, espe - cially the Javanese, suffered terribly . Following the Japanese surrender , a charismatic leader named Sukarno emerged to declare independ- ence . Four years of fighting finally ended on December 27, 1949 , when the Netherlands lowered its flag and returned sovereignty to a people who had known nothing but struggle and domination fo r more than three centuries . Sukarno became the new republic's firs t president . Ruling Indonesia, however, proved to be a greater challenge tha n defeating the Dutch . Far from homogeneous, the archipelago o f about 17,500 islands was a boiling pot of tribalism, divergent cultures, dozens of languages and dialects, and ethnic groups who nurse d centuries-old animosities . Conflicts were frequent and brutal, an d Sukarno clamped down . He suspended parliament in 1960 and wa s named president-for-life in 1963 . He formed close alliances wit h Communist governments around the world, in exchange for militar y equipment and training . He sent Russian-armed Indonesian troop s into neighboring Malaysia in an attempt to spread communis m throughout Southeast Asia and win the approval of the world's Social - ist leaders . Opposition built, and a coup was launched in 1965 . Sukarno es - caped assassination only through the quick wits of his mistress . Many of his top military officers and his closest associates were les s lucky . The events were reminiscent of those in Iran in 1953 . In th e end, the Communist Party was held responsible — especially thos e factions aligned with China . In the Army-initiated massacres tha t followed, an estimated three hundred thousand to five hundred thou - sand people were killed . The head of the military, General Suharto , took over as president in 1968 . 1 By 1971, the United States' determination to seduce Indonesi a away from communism was heightened because the outcome of th e Vietnam War was looking very uncertain . President Nixon had begu n a series of troop withdrawals in the summer of 1969, and U .S . strat- egy was taking on a more global perspective . The strategy focused o n preventing a domino effect of one country after another falling unde r Communist rule, and it focused on a couple of countries ; Indonesi a was the key . MAIN'S electrification project was part of a compre- hensive plan to ensure American dominance in Southeast Asia . The premise of U .S . foreign policy was that Suharto would serv e Washington in a manner similar to the shah of Iran . The Unite d States also hoped the nation would serve as a model for other coun- tries in the region . Washington based part of its strategy on th e assumption that gains made in Indonesia might have positive reper- cussions throughout the Islamic world, particularly in the explosiv e Middle East . And if that were not incentive enough, Indonesia ha d oil . No one was certain about the magnitude or quality of its reserves , but oil company seismologists were exuberant over the possibilities . As I pored over the books at the BPL, my excitement grew . I bega n to imagine the adventures ahead . In working for MAIN, I would b e trading the rugged Peace Corps lifestyle for a much more luxuriou s 20 \t Indonesia : Lessons for an EHM 21"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"and glamorous one . My time with Claudine already represented th e realization of one of my fantasies ; it seemed too good to be true . I fel t at least partially vindicated for serving the sentence at that all-boys ' prep school . Something else was also happening in my life : Ann and I wer e not getting along . I think she must have sensed that I was leadin g two lives . I justified it as the logical result of the resentment I felt to - ward her for forcing us to get married in the first place . Never min d that she had nurtured and supported me through the challenges o f our Peace Corps assignment in Ecuador ; I still saw her as a contin- uation of my pattern of giving in to my parents' whims . Of course, a s I look back on it, I'm sure my relationship with Claudine was a ma- jor factor . I could not tell Ann about this, but she sensed it . In an y case, we decided to move into separate apartments . One day in 1971, about a week before my scheduled departure fo r Indonesia, I arrived at Claudine's place to find the small dining roo m table set with an assortment of cheeses and breads, and there was a fine bottle of Beaujolais . She toasted me . \"You've made it . \" She smiled, but somehow it seemed less tha n sincere . \"You're now one of us . \" We chatted casually for half an hour or so ; then, as we were fin- ishing off the wine, she gave me a look unlike any I had seen before . \"Never admit to anyone about our meetings,\" she said in a ster n voice . \"I won't forgive you if you do, ever, and I'll deny I ever me t you .\" She glared at me — perhaps the only time I felt threatened b y her — and then gave a cold laugh . \"Talking about us would make lif e dangerous for you . \" I was stunned . I felt terrible . But later, as I walked alone back t o the Prudential Center, I had to admit to the cleverness of th e scheme . The fact is that all our time together had been spent in he r apartment . There was not a trace of evidence about our relationship , and no one at MAIN was implicated in any way . There was also par t of me that appreciated her honesty ; she had not deceived me the wa y my parents had about Tilton and Middlebury . CHAPTER 4 Saving a Country from Communis m I had a romanticized vision of Indonesia, the country where I was t o live for the next three months . Some of the books I read feature d photographs of beautiful women in brightly colored sarongs, exoti c Balinese dancers, shamans blowing fire, and warriors paddling lon g dugout canoes in emerald waters at the foot of smoking volcanoes . Particularly striking was a series on the magnificent black-saile d galleons of the infamous Bugi pirates, who still sailed the seas of th e archipelago, and who had so terrorized early European sailors tha t they returned home to warn their children, \"Behave yourselves, o r the Bugimen will get you .\" Oh, how those pictures stirred my soul . The history and legends of that country represent a cornucopia o f larger-than-life figures : wrathful gods, Komodo dragons, tribal sul- tans, and ancient tales that long before the birth of Christ had trav- eled across Asian mountains, through Persian deserts, and over th e Mediterranean to embed themselves in the deepest realms of ou r collective psyche . The very names of its fabled islands — Java, Suma - tra, Borneo, Sulawesi — seduced the mind . Here was a land of mys- ticism, myth, and erotic beauty ; an elusive treasure sought but neve r found by Columbus ; a princess wooed yet never possessed by Spain , by Holland, by Portugal, by Japan ; a fantasy and a dream . My expectations were high, and I suppose they mirrored those o f the great explorers . Like Columbus, though, I should have known t o temper my fantasies . Perhaps I could have guessed that the beaco n shines on a destiny that is not always the one we envision .

In fact, my first days in Indonesi a ' s steamy capital, Jakarta, i n the summer of 1971, were shocking . The beauty was certainly present . Gorgeous women sportin g colorful sarongs . Lush gardens ablaze with tropical flowers . Exoti c Balinese dancers . Bicycle cabs with fanciful, rainbow-colored scene s painted on the sides of the high seats, where passengers reclined i n front of the pedaling drivers . Dutch Colonial mansions and turrete d mosques . But there was also an ugly, tragic side to the city . Leper s holding out bloodied stumps instead of hands . Young girls offerin g their bodies for a few coins . Once-splendid Dutch canals turned int o cesspools . Cardboard hovels where entire families lived alon g the trash-lined banks of black rivers . Blaring horns and chokin g fumes . The beautiful and the ugly, the elegant and the vulgar, th e spiritual and the profane . This was Jakarta, where the enticing scen t of cloves and orchid blossoms battled the miasma of open sewers fo r dominance . I had seen poverty before . Some of my New Hampshire class - mates lived in cold-water tarpaper shacks and arrived at schoo l wearing thin jackets and frayed tennis shoes on subzero winter days , their unwashed bodies reeking of old sweat and manure . I had live d in mud shacks with Andean peasants whose diet consisted almos t entirely of dried corn and potatoes, and where it sometimes seeme d that a newborn was as likely to die as to experience a birthday . I ha d seen poverty, but nothing to prepare me for Jakarta . Our team, of course, was quartered in the country's fanciest hotel , the Hotel InterContinental Indonesia . Owned by Pan American Air - ways, like the rest of the InterContinental chain scattered around th e globe, it catered to the whims of wealthy foreigners, especially oil ex - ecutives and their families . On the evening of our first day, our proj- ect manager Charlie Illingworth hosted a dinner for us in the elegan t restaurant on the top floor . Charlie was a connoisseur of war ; he devoted most of his fre e time to reading history books and historical novels about great militar y leaders and battles . He was the epitome of the pro-Vietnam Wa r armchair soldier . As usual, this night he was wearing khaki slack s and a short-sleeved khaki shirt with military-style epaulettes . After welcoming us, he lit up a cigar . \"To the good life,\" he sighed , raising a glass of champagne . We joined him . \"To the good life . \" Our glasses clinked . Cigar smoke swirling around him, Charlie glanced about th e room . \" We will be well pampered here, \" he said, nodding his hea d appreciatively . \"The Indonesians will take very good care of us . A s will the U .S . Embassy people . But le t ' s not forget that we have a mis - sion to accomplish .\" He looked down at a handful of note cards . \"Yes , we're here to develop a master plan for the electrification of Java — the most populated land in the world . But that's just the tip of th e iceberg . \" His expression turned serious ; he reminded me of George C . Scott playing General Patton, one of Charlie's heroes . \"We are here t o accomplish nothing short of saving this country from the clutches o f communism . As you know, Indonesia has a long and tragic history . Now, at a time when it is poised to launch itself into the twentiet h century, it is tested once again . Our responsibility is to make sure tha t Indonesia doesn't follow in the footsteps of its northern neighbors , Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos . An integrated electrical system is a key element . That, more than any other single factor (with the possi- ble exception of oil), will assure that capitalism and democracy rule . `\"Speaking of oil,\" he said . He took another puff on his cigar an d flipped past a couple of the note cards . \"We all know how dependen t our own country is on oil . Indonesia can be a powerful ally to us i n that regard . So, as you develop this master plan, please do everythin g you can to make sure that the oil industry and all the others tha t serve it—ports, pipelines, construction companies—get whateve r they are likely to need in the way of electricity for the entire duratio n of this twenty-five-year plan . \" He raised his eyes from his note cards and looked directly at me . \"Better to err on the high side than to underestimate . You don't wan t the blood of Indonesian children — or our own — on your hands . Yo u don't want them to live under the hammer and sickle or the Red fla g of China! \" As I lay in my bed that night, high above the city, secure in th e luxury of a first-class suite, an image of Claudine came to me . He r discourses on foreign debt haunted me . I tried to comfort myself b y recalling lessons learned in my macroeconomics courses at busines s school . After all, I told myself, I am here to help Indonesia rise out o f a medieval economy and take its place in the modern industria l world . But I knew that in the morning I would look out my window , 24 Part I : 1963—1971 \t Saving a Country from Communism 25"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"across the opulence of the hote l ' s gardens and swimming pools, an d see the hovels that fanned out for miles beyond . I would know tha t babies were dying out there for lack of food and potable water, an d that infants and adults alike were suffering from horrible disease s and living in terrible conditions . Tossing and turning in my bed, I found it impossible to deny tha t Charlie and everyone else on our team were here for selfish reasons . We were promoting U .S . foreign policy and corporate interests . W e were driven by greed rather than by any desire to make life better fo r the vast majority of Indonesians . A word came to mind : corporatoc- racy . I was not sure whether I had heard it before or had just in - vented it, but it seemed to describe perfectly the new elite who ha d made up their minds to attempt to rule the planet . This was a close-knit fraternity of a few men with shared goals , and the fraternity's members moved easily and often between cor- porate boards and government positions . It struck me that the cur - rent president of the World Bank, Robert McNamara, was a perfec t example . He had moved from a position as president of Ford Moto r Company, to secretary of defense under presidents Kennedy an d Johnson, and now occupied the top post at the world's most power- ful financial institution . I also realized that my college professors had not understood th e true nature of macroeconomics : that in many cases helping an econ - omy grow only makes those few people who sit atop the pyrami d even richer, while it does nothing for those at the bottom except t o push them even lower . Indeed, promoting capitalism often results i n a system that resembles medieval feudal societies . If any of my pro - fessors knew this, they had not admitted it — probably because bi g corporations, and the men who run them, fund colleges . Exposin g the truth would undoubtedly cost those professors their jobs—jus t as such revelations could cost me mine . These thoughts continued to disturb my sleep every night that I spent at the Hotel InterContinental Indonesia . In the end, my pri- mary defense was a highly personal one : I had fought my way out o f that New Hampshire town, the prep school, and the draft . Throug h a combination of coincidences and hard work, I had earned a plac e in the good life . I also took comfort in the fact that I was doing th e right thing in the eyes of my culture . I was on my way to becomin g a successful and respected economist . I was doing what business school had prepared me for . I was helping implement a developmen t model that was sanctioned by the best minds at the worl d ' s top thin k tanks . Nonetheless, in the middle of the night I often had to console my - self with a promise that someday I would expose the truth . Then I would read myself to sleep with Louis L' Amour novels about gun - fighters in the Old West . 26 Part I : 1963—1971 \t Saving a Country from Communism 27"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 5 Selling My Sou l Our eleven-man team spent six days in Jakarta registering at th e U .S . Embassy, meeting various officials, organizing ourselves, an d relaxing around the pool . The number of Americans who lived at th e Hotel InterContinental amazed me . I took great pleasure in watch- ing the beautiful young women — wives of U .S . oil and constructio n company executives—who passed their days at the pool and thei r evenings in the half dozen posh restaurants in and around the hotel . Then Charlie moved our team to the mountain city of Bandung . The climate was milder, the poverty less obvious, and the distrac- tions fewer . We were given a government guesthouse known as th e Wisma, complete with a manager, a cook, a gardener, and a staff o f servants . Built during the Dutch colonial period, the Wisma was a haven . Its spacious veranda faced tea plantations that flowed acros s rolling hills and up the slopes of Java's volcanic mountains . In addi - tion to housing, we were provided with eleven Toyota off-road vehi - cles, each with a driver and translator . Finally, we were presente d with memberships to the exclusive Bandung Golf and Racket Club , and we were housed in a suite of offices at the local headquarters o f Perusahaan Umum Listrik Negara (PLN), the government-owne d electric utility company . For me, the first several days in Bandung involved a series o f meetings with Charlie and Howard Parker . Howard was in his sev- enties and was the retired chief load forecaster for the New England Electric System . Now he was responsible for forecasting the amoun t of energy and generating capacity (the load) the island of Java woul d need over the next twenty-five years, as well as for breaking thi s down into city and regional forecasts . Since electric demand is highl y correlated with economic growth, his forecasts depended on my eco - nomic projections . The rest of our team would develop the maste r plan around these forecasts, locating and designing power plants , transmission and distribution lines, and fuel transportation system s in a manner that would satisfy our projections as efficiently as pos - sible . During our meetings, Charlie continually emphasized the im - portance of my job, and he badgered me about the need to be ver y optimistic in my forecasts . Claudine had been right ; I was the key t o the entire master plan . \"The first few weeks here,\" Charlie explained, \"are about dat a collection . \" He, Howard, and I were seated in big rattan chairs in Charlie' s plush private office . The walls were decorated with batik tapestrie s depicting epic tales from the ancient Hindu texts of the Ramayana . Charlie puffed on a fat cigar . \"The engineers will put together a detailed picture of the curren t electric system, port capacities, roads, railroads, all those sorts o f things .\" He pointed his cigar at me . \"You gotta act fast . By the end o f month one, Howard'll need to get a pretty good idea about the ful l extent of the economic miracles that'll happen when we get the ne w grid online . By the end of the second month, he'll need more detail s — broken down into regions . The last month will be about filling i n the gaps . That'll be critical . All of us will put our heads togethe r then . So, before we leave we gotta be absolutely certain we have al l the information we'll need . Home for Thanksgiving, that's my motto . There's no coming back . \" Howard appeared to be an amiable, grandfatherly type, but h e was actually a bitter old man who felt cheated by life . He had neve r reached the pinnacle of the New England Electric System and h e deeply resented it . \"Passed over,\" he told me repeatedly, \"because I refused to buy the company line .\" He had been forced into retire- ment and then, unable to tolerate staying at home with his wife, ha d accepted a consulting job with MAIN . This was his second assign- ment, and I had been warned by both Einar and Charlie to watc h 28 \t Selling My Soul 29"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"out for him . They described him with words like stubborn, mean , and vindictive . As it turned out, Howard was one of my wisest teachers, althoug h not one I was ready to accept at the time . He had never received th e type of training Claudine had given me . I suppose they considere d him too old, or perhaps too stubborn . Or maybe they figured he wa s only in it for the short run, until they could lure in a more pliabl e full-timer like me . In any case, from their standpoint, he turned ou t to be a problem . Howard clearly saw the situation and the role the y wanted him to play, and he was determined not to be a pawn . All th e adjectives Einar and Charlie had used to describe him were appro- priate, but at least some of his stubbornness grew out of his persona l commitment not to be their servant . I doubt he had ever heard th e term economic hit man, but he knew they intended to use him t o promote a form of imperialism he could not accept . He took me aside after one of our meetings with Charlie . He wor e a hearing aid and fiddled with the little box under his shirt that con - trolled its volume . \"This is between you and me,\" Howard said in a hushed voice . W e were standing at the window in the office we shared, looking ou t at the stagnant canal that wound past the PLN building . A youn g woman was bathing in its foul waters, attempting to retain som e semblance of modesty by loosely draping a sarong around her other - wise naked body . \"They'll try to convince you that this economy is go - ing to skyrocket,\" he said . \"Charlie's ruthless . Don't let him get to you . \" His words gave me a sinking feeling, but also a desire to convinc e him that Charlie was right ; after all, my career depended on pleasin g my MAIN bosses . \"Surely this economy will boom,\" I said, my eyes drawn to th e woman in the canal . \"Just look at what's happening . \" \"So there you are,\" he muttered, apparently unaware of the scen e in front of us . \"You've already bought their line, have you? \" A movement up the canal caught my attention . An elderly ma n had descended the bank, dropped his pants, and squatted at th e edge of the water to answer nature's call . The young woman saw hi m but was undeterred ; she continued bathing . I turned away from th e window and looked directly at Howard . \"I've been around,\" I said . \"I may be young, but I just got back from three years in South America . I've seen what can happen whe n oil is discovered . Things change fast . \" \" Oh, I ' ve been around too, \" he said mockingly . \" A great man y years . I ' ll tell you something, young man . I do n ' t give a damn for you r oil discoveries and all that . I forecasted electric loads all my life — during the Depression, World War II, times of bust and boom . I'v e seen what Route 128's so-called Massachusetts Miracle did fo r Boston . And I can say for sure that no electric load ever grew b y more than 7 to 9 percent a year for any sustained period . And that' s in the best of times . Six percent is more reasonable . \" I stared at him . Part of me suspected he was right, but I felt de- fensive . I knew I had to convince him, because my own conscienc e cried out for justification . \"Howard, this isn't Boston . This is a country where, until now, n o one could even get electricity . Things are different here . \" He turned on his heel and waved his hand as though he coul d brush me away . \"Go ahead,\" he snarled . \"Sell out . I don't give a damn what yo u come up with .\" He jerked his chair from behind his desk and fell int o it . \"I'll make my electricity forecast based on what I believe, not som e pie-in-the-sky economic study .\" He picked up his pencil and starte d to scribble on a pad of paper . It was a challenge I could not ignore . I went and stood in front o f his desk . \"You'll look pretty stupid if I come up with what everyone expect s — a boom to rival the California gold rush — and you forecast elec- tricity growth at a rate comparable to Boston in the 1960s \" He slammed the pencil down and glared at me . \"Unconscionable ! That's what it is . You — all of you — \" he waved his arms at the office s beyond our walls, \"you've sold your souls to the devil . You're in it fo r the money . Now,\" he feigned a smile and reached under his shirt , \"I'm turning off my hearing aid and going back to work . \" It shook me to the core . I stomped out of the room and heade d for Charlie's office . Halfway there, I stopped, uncertain about what I intended to accomplish . Instead, I turned and walked down the stairs , out the door, into the afternoon sunlight . The young woman wa s climbing out of the canal, her sarong wrapped tightly about he r body . The elderly man had disappeared . Several boys played in th e 30 \t Part I : 1963—1971 \t Selling My Soul \t 31"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"canal, splashing and shouting at each other . An older woman wa s standing knee-deep in the water, brushing her teeth ; another wa s scrubbing clothes . A huge lump grew in my throat . I sat down on a slab of broke n concrete, trying to disregard the pungent odor from the canal . I fought hard to hold back the tears ; I needed to figure out why I fel t so miserable . You're in it for the money . I heard Howard's words, over and over . He had struck a raw nerve . The little boys continued to splash each other, their gleeful voice s filling the air . I wondered what I could do . What would it take to mak e me carefree like them? The question tormented me as I sat ther e watching them cavort in their blissful innocence, apparently un - aware of the risk they took by playing in that fetid water . An elderly , hunchbacked man with a gnarled cane hobbled along the ban k above the canal . He stopped and watched the boys, and his fac e broke into a toothless grin . Perhaps I could confide in Howard ; maybe together we woul d arrive at a solution . I immediately felt a sense of relief . I picked up a little stone and threw it into the canal . As the ripples faded, however , so did my euphoria . I knew I could do no such thing . Howard wa s old and bitter . He had already passed up opportunities to advanc e his own career . Surely, he would not buckle now . I was young, jus t starting out, and certainly did not want to end up like him . Staring into the water of that putrid canal, I once again saw im- ages of the New Hampshire prep school on the hill, where I ha d spent vacations alone while the other boys went off to their debu- tante balls . Slowly the sorry fact settled in . Once again, there was n o one I could talk to . That night I lay in bed, thinking for a long time about the peopl e in my life — Howard, Charlie, Claudine, Ann, Einar, Uncle Frank — wondering what my life would be like if I had never met them . Where would I be living? Not Indonesia, that was for sure . I wondere d also about my future, about where I was headed . I pondered the de- cision confronting me . Charlie had made it clear that he expecte d Howard and me to come up with growth rates of at least 17 percen t per annum . What kind of forecast would I produce ? Suddenly a thought came to me that soothed my soul . Why had i t not occurred to me before? The decision was not mine at all . Howard had said that he would do what he considered right, regardless of m y conclusions . I could please my bosses with a high economic forecas t and he would make his own decision ; my work would have no effec t on the master plan . People kept emphasizing the importance of m y role, but they were wrong . A great burden had been lifted . I fell int o a deep sleep . A few days later, Howard was taken ill with a severe amoebi c attack . We rushed him to a Catholic missionary hospital . The doc- tors prescribed medication and strongly recommended that h e return immediately to the United States . Howard assured us that h e already had all the data he needed and could easily complete th e load forecast from Boston . His parting words to me were a reitera- tion of his earlier warning . \"No need to cook the numbers,\" he said . \"I'll not be part of tha t scam, no matter what you say about the miracles of economi c growth! \" 32 \t Part I : 1963—1971 \t Selling My Soul \t 33"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"PART I I : 1971-1975"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 6 My Role as Inquisito r Our contracts with the Indonesian government, the Asian Develop- ment Bank, and USAID required that someone on our team visit al l the major population centers in the area covered by the master plan . I was designated to fulfill this condition . As Charlie put it, \"You survive d the Amazon ; you know how to handle bugs, snakes, and bad water . \" Along with a driver and translator, I visited many beautiful place s and stayed in some pretty dismal lodgings . I met with local busines s and political leaders and listened to their opinions about the pros- pects for economic growth . However, I found most of them reluctan t to share information with me . They seemed intimidated by my pres- ence . Typically, they told me that I would have to check with thei r bosses, with government agencies, or with corporate headquarters i n Jakarta . I sometimes suspected some sort of conspiracy was directe d at me . These trips were usually short, not more than two or three days . In between, I returned to the Wisma in Bandung . The woman wh o managed it had a son a few years younger than me . His name wa s Rasmon, but to everyone except his mother he was Rasy . A studen t of economics at a local university, he immediately took an interest i n my work . In fact, I suspected that at some point he would approac h me for a job . He also began to teach me Bahasa Indonesia . Creating an easy-to-learn language had been President Sukarno' s highest priority after Indonesia won its independence from Holland . 37"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Over 350 languages and dialects are spoken throughout the archi- pelago,' and Sukarno realized that his country needed a commo n vocabulary in order to unite people from the many islands and cul- tures . He recruited an international team of linguists, and Bahas a Indonesia was the highly successful result . Based on Malay, it avoid s many of the tense changes, irregular verbs, and other complication s that characterize most languages . By the early 1970s, the majority o f Indonesians spoke it, although they continued to rely on Javanes e and other local dialects within their own communities . Rasy was a great teacher with a wonderful sense of humor, and compared t o learning Shuar or even Spanish, Bahasa was easy . Rasv owned a motor scooter and took it upon himself to intro - duce me to his city and people . \"I'll show you a side of Indonesia yo u haven't seen,\" he promised one evening, and urged me to hop o n behind him . We passed shadow-puppet shows, musicians playing traditiona l instruments, fire-blowers, jugglers, and street vendors selling ever y imaginable ware, from contraband American cassettes to rare indige - nous artifacts . Finally, we ended up at a tiny coffeehouse populate d by young men and women whose clothes, hats, and hairstyles woul d have been right in fashion at a Beatles concert in the late 1960s ; however, everyone was distinctly Indonesian . Rasy introduced me t o a group seated around a table and we sat down . They all spoke English, with varying degrees of fluency, but the y appreciated and encouraged my attempts at Bahasa . They talke d about this openly and asked me why Americans never learned thei r language . I had no answer . Nor could I explain why I was the onl y American or European in this part of the city, even though you coul d always find plenty of us at the Golf and Racket Club, the pos h restaurants, the movie theaters, and the upscale supermarkets . It was a night I shall always remember . Rasy and his friend s treated me as one of their own . I enjoyed a sense of euphoria fro m being there, sharing their city, food, and music, smelling the clov e cigarettes and other aromas that were part of their lives, joking an d laughing with them . It was like the Peace Corps all over again, an d I found myself wondering why I had thought that I wanted to trave l first class and separate myself from people like this . As the nigh t wore on, they became increasingly interested in learning my thoughts about their country and about the war my country was fighting i n Vietnam . Every one of them was horrified by what they referred to a s \"the illegal invasion,\" and they were relieved to discover I share d their feelings . By the time Rasy and I returned to the guesthouse it was late an d the place was dark . I thanked him profusely for inviting me into hi s world : he thanked me for opening up to his friends . We promised t o do it again, hugged, and headed off to our respective rooms . That experience with Rasy whetted my appetite for spending mor e time away from the MAIN team . The next morning, I had a meetin g with Charlie and told him I was becoming frustrated trying to obtai n information from local people . In addition, most of the statistics I needed for developing economic forecasts could only be found a t government offices in Jakarta . Charlie and I agreed that I woul d need to spend one to two weeks in Jakarta . He expressed sympathy for me, having to abandon Bandung fo r the steaming metropolis, and I professed to detest the idea . Secretly , however, I was excited by the opportunity to have some time t o myself, to explore Jakarta and to live at the elegant Hotel InterCon - tinental Indonesia . Once in Jakarta, however, I discovered that I now viewed life from a different perspective . The night spent wit h Rasy and the young Indonesians, as well as my travels around th e country, had changed me . I found that I saw my fellow Americans i n a different light . The young wives seemed not quite so beautiful . Th e chain-link fence around the pool and the steel bars outside the win - dows on the lower floors, which I had barely noticed before, no w took on an ominous appearance . The food in the hotel's elegan t restaurants seemed insipid . I noticed something else too . During my meetings with politica l and business leaders, I became aware of subtleties in the way the y treated me . I had not perceived it before, but now I saw that many o f them resented my presence . For example, when they introduced m e to each other, they often used Bahasa terms that according to m y dictionary translated to inquisitor and interrogator . I purposely neg - lected disclosing my knowledge of their language — even my trans- lator knew only that I could recite a few stock phrases — and I purchased a good Bahasa/English dictionary, which I often use d after leaving them . 38 \t Part II : 1971—1975 \t My Role as Inquisitor 39"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"\t Were these addresses just coincidences of language?

For instance, I could never just wal k into an office with my translator and meet with someone ; we firs t had to set up an appointment . In itself, this would not have seeme d so strange, except that doing so was outrageously time consuming . Since the phones seldom worked, we had to drive through the traf- fic-choked streets, which were laid out in such a contorted manne r that it could take an hour to reach a building only blocks away . Onc e there, we were asked to fill out several forms . Eventually, a male sec - \t 1 retary would appear . Politely— always with the courteous smile for \t I which the Javanese are famous—he would question me about th e types of information I desired, and then he would establish a tim e for the meeting . \t I I Without exception, the scheduled appointment was at least sev- eral days away, and when the meeting finally occurred I was hande d a folder of prepared materials . The industry owners gave me five - and ten-year plans, the bankers had charts and graphs, and the gov - \t ernment officials provided lists of projects that were in the process of \t 1 leaving the drawing boards to become engines of economic growth . Everything these captains of commerce and government provided , and all they said during the interviews, indicated that Java wa s poised for perhaps the biggest boom any economy had ever enjoyed . No one — not a single person — ever questioned this premise or gav e me any negative information . As I headed back to Bandung, though, I found myself wonderin g about all these experiences ; something was deeply disturbing . It oc- curred to me that everything I was doing in Indonesia was more lik e 40 \t Part 11 : 1971—1975 \t My Role as Inquisitor \t 41"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 7 Civilization on Tria l \"I'm taking you to a dalang,\" Rasy beamed . \"You know, the famou s Indonesian puppet masters .\" He was obviously pleased to have m e back in Bandung . \"There's a very important one in town tonight : ' He drove me on his scooter through parts of his city I did no t know existed, through sections filled with traditional Javanes e lcampong houses, which looked like a poor person's version of tin y tile-roofed temples . Gone were the stately Dutch Colonial mansion s and office buildings I had grown to expect . The people were obvi- ously poor, yet they bore themsel v es with great pride . They wor e threadbare but clean batik sarongs, brightly colored blouses, an d wide-brimmed straw hats . Everywhere we went we were greete d with smiles and laughter . When we stopped, children rushed up t o touch me and feel the fabric of my jeans . One little girl stuck a fra- grant frangipani blossom in my hair . We parked the scooter near a sidewalk theater where several hun- dred people were gathered, some standing, others sitting in portabl e chairs . The night was clear and beautiful . Although we were in th e heart of the oldest section of Bandung, there were no streetlights, s o the stars sparkled over our heads . The air was filled with the aroma s of wood fires, peanuts, and cloves . Rasy disappeared into the crowd and soon returned with many o f the young people I had met at the coffeehouse . They offered me ho t tea, little cakes, and sate, tiny bits of meat cooked in peanut oil . I must have hesitated before accepting the latter, because one of the women pointed at a small fire . \"Very fresh meat, \" she laughed . \"Jus t cooked . \" Then the music started—the hauntingly magical sounds of th e garnalong, an instrument that conjures images of temple bells . \"The dalang plays all the music by himself,\" Rasy whispered . \"H e also works all the puppets and speaks their voices, several languages . We'll translate for you . \" It was a remarkable performance, combining traditional legend s with current events . I would later learn that the dalang is a shama n who does his work in trance . He had over a hundred puppets and h e spoke for each in a different voice . It was a night I will never forget , and one that has influenced the rest of my life . After completing a classic selection from the ancient texts of th e Ramayana, the dalang produced a puppet of Richard Nixon, complet e with the distinctive long nose and sagging jowls . The U .S . presiden t was dressed like Uncle Sam, in a stars-and-stripes top hat and tails . He was accompanied by another puppet, which wore a three-piec e pin-striped suit . The second puppet carried in one hand a bucke t decorated with dollar signs . He used his free hand to wave an Ameri- can flag over Nixon's head in the manner of a slave fanning a master . A map of the Middle and Far East appeared behind the two, th e various countries hanging from hooks in their respective positions . Nixon immediately approached the map, lifted Vietnam off its hook , and thrust it to his mouth . He shouted something that was trans- lated as, \"Bitter! Rubbish . We don't need any more of this!\" Then h e tossed it into the bucket and proceeded to do the same with othe r countries . I was surprised, however, to see that his next selections did no t include the domino nations of Southeast Asia . Rather, they were al l Middle Eastern countries — Palestine, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Iraq , Syria, and Iran . After that, he turned to Pakistan and Afghanistan . Each time, the Nixon doll screamed out some epithet before drop - ping the country into his bucket, and in every instance, his vitupera- tive words were anti-Islamic : \"Muslim dogs,\" \"Mohammed's monsters, \" and \"Islamic devils . \" The crowd became very excited, the tension mounting with eac h new addition to the bucket . They seemed torn between fits of laughter , shock, and rage . At times, I sensed they took offense at the puppeteer' s language . I also felt intimidated ; I stood out in this crowd, talle r 42 \t Civilization on Trial 43"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"than the rest, and I worried that they might direct their anger at me . Then Nixon said something that made my scalp tingle when Ras y translated it . \" Give this one to the World Bank .

This puppet represented an In- donesian man, dressed in batik shirt and khaki slacks, and he wor e a sign with his name clearly printed on it . \"A popular Bandung politician,\" Rasy explained . This puppet literally flew between Nixon and Bucket Man an d held up his hand . \"Stop!\" he shouted . \"Indonesia is sovereign . \" The crowd burst into applause . Then Bucket Man lifted his fla g and thrust it like a spear into the Indonesian, who staggered an d died a most dramatic death . The audience members booed, hooted , screamed, and shook their fists . Nixon and Bucket Man stood there , looking out at us . They bowed and left the stage . \"I think I should go,\" I said to Rasy . He placed a hand protectively around my shoulder . \"It's okay,\" h e said . \"They have nothing against you personally .\" I wasn't so sure . Later we all retired to the coffeehouse . Rasy and the others as- sured me that they had not been informed ahead of time about th e Nixon-World Bank skit . \"You never know what to expect from tha t puppeteer,\" one of the young men observed . I wondered aloud whether this had been staged in my honor . Someone laughed and said I had a very big ego . \"Typical of Ameri - cans,\" he added, patting my back congenially . \"Indonesians are very conscious of politics,\" the man in the chai r beside me said . \"Don't Americans go to shows like this? \" A beautiful woman, an English major at the university, sat acros s the table from me . \"But you do work for the World Bank, don't you? \" she asked . I told her that my current assignment was for the Asian Devel- opment Bank and the United States Agency for Internationa l Development . 'Aren't they really all the same?\" She didn't wait for an answer . \"Isn't it like the play tonight showed? Doesn't your government look at Indonesia and other countries as though we are just a bunch of . . \" She searched for the word . \" Grapes, \" one of her friends coached . \" Exactly . A bunch of grapes . You can pick and choose . Keep Eng - land . Eat China . And throw away Indonesia . \" 'After you've taken all our oil,\" another woman added . I tried to defend myself but was not at all up to the task . I wante d to take pride in the fact that I had come to this part of town and ha d stayed to watch the entire anti-U .S . performance, which I migh t have construed as a personal assault . I wanted them to see th e courage of what I had done, to know that I was the only member o f my team who bothered to learn Bahasa or had any desire to take i n their culture, and to point out that I was the sole foreigner attendin g this production . But I decided it would be more prudent not to men - tion any of this . Instead, I tried to refocus the conversation . I aske d them why they thought the dalang had singled out Muslim coun- tries, except for Vietnam . The beautiful English major laughed at this . \"Because that's th e plan . \" \"Vietnam is just a holding action,\" one of the men interjected , \"like Holland was for the Nazis . A stepping-stone . \" \"The real target,\" the woman continued, \"is the Muslim world . \" I could not let this go unanswered . \"Surely,\" I protested, \"you can' t believe that the United States is anti-Islamic \" \"Oh no?\" she asked . \"Since when? You need to read one of you r own historians — a Brit named Toynbee .

CHAPTER 8 Jesus, Seen Differentl y The memory of that dalang stuck with me . So did the words of th e beautiful English major . That night in Bandung catapulted me to a new level of thinking and feeling . While I had not exactly ignore d the implications of what we were doing in Indonesia, my reaction s had been ruled by emotions, and I usually had been able to calm m y feelings by calling on reason, on the example of history, and on th e biological imperative . I had justified our involvement as part of th e human condition, convincing myself that Einar, Charlie, and the res t of us were simply acting as men always have : taking care of ourselve s and our families . My discussion with those young Indonesians, however, forced m e to see another aspect of the issue . Through their eyes, I realized tha t a selfish approach to foreign policy does not serve or protect futur e generations anywhere . It is myopic, like the annual reports of th e corporations and the election strategies of the politicians who for- mulate that foreign policy . As it turned out, the data I needed for my economic forecast s required frequent visits to Jakarta . I took advantage of my tim e alone there to ponder these matters and to write about them in a journal . I wandered the streets of that city, handed money to beggars , and attempted to engage lepers, prostitutes, and street urchins i n conversation . Meanwhile, I pondered the nature of foreign aid, and I consid- ered the legitimate role that developed countries (DCs, in Worl d 46 \t Part II : 1971—1975 \t 47"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Bank jargon) might play in helping alleviate poverty and misery i n less-developed countries (LDCs) . I began to wonder when foreig n aid is genuine and when it is only greedy and self-serving . Indeed, I began to question whether such aid is ever altruistic, and if not , whether that could be changed . I was certain that countries like m y own should take decisive action to help the sick and starving of th e world, but I was equally certain that this was seldom — if ever — the prime motivation for our intervention . I kept coming back to one main question : if the objective of for- eign aid is imperialism, is that so wrong? I often found myself envy - ing people like Charlie who believed so strongly in our system tha t they wanted to force it on the rest of the world . I doubted whethe r limited resources would allow the whole world to live the opulen t life of the United States, when even the United States had millions o f citizens living in poverty . In addition, it wasn't entirely clear to me tha t people in other nations actually want to live like us . Our own statis - tics about violence, depression, drug abuse, divorce, and crime in- dicated that although ours was one of the wealthiest societies i n history, it may also be one of the least happy societies . Why would w e want others to emulate us ? Perhaps Claudine had warned me of all this . I was no longer sur e what it was she had been trying to tell me . In any case, intellectua l arguments aside, it had now become painfully clear that my days o f innocence were gone . I wrote in my journal : Is anyone in the U .S . innocent? Although those at th e very pinnacle of the economic pyramid gain the most , millions of us depend — either directly or indirectly—o n the exploitation of the LDCs for our livelihoods . Th e resources and cheap labor that feed nearly all our busi- nesses come from places like Indonesia, and very littl e ever makes its way back . The loans of foreign aid ensur e that today's children and their grandchildren will be hel d hostage . They will have to allow our corporations to ravag e their natural resources and will have to forego education , health, and other social services merely to pay us back . The fact that our own companies already received mos t of this money to build the power plants, airports, and industrial parks does not factor into this formula . Does th e excuse that most Americans are unaware of this constitut e innocence? Uninformed and intentionally misinformed , yes — but innocent ? Of course, I had to face the fact that I was now numbered amon g those who actively misinform . The concept of a worldwide holy war was a disturbing one, bu t the longer I contemplated it, the more convinced I became of its pos - sibility . It seemed to me, however, that if this jihad were to occur i t would be less about Muslims versus Christians than it would b e about LDCs versus DCs, perhaps with Muslims at the forefront . W e in the DCs were the users of resources ; those in the LDCs were th e suppliers . It was the colonial mercantile system all over again, set u p to make it easy for those with power and limited natural resources t o exploit those with resources but no power . I did not have a copy of Toynbee with me, but I knew enough his - tory to understand that suppliers who are exploited long enough wil l rebel . I only had to return to the American Revolution and To m Paine for a model . I recalled that Britain justified its taxes by claim - ing that England was providing aid to the colonies in the form o f military protection against the French and the Indians . The colonist s had a very different interpretation . What Paine offered to his countrymen in the brilliant Commo n Sense was the soul that my young Indonesian friends had referred t o — an idea, a faith in the justice of a higher power, and a religion o f freedom and equality that was diametrically opposed to the Britis h monarchy and its elitist class systems . What Muslims offered wa s similar : faith in a higher power and a belief that developed countrie s have no right to subjugate and exploit the rest of the world . Lik e colonial minutemen, Muslims were threatening to fight for thei r rights, and like the British in the 1770s, we classified such actions a s terrorism . History appeared to be repeating itself . I wondered what sort of a world we might have if the Unite d States and its allies diverted all the monies expended in colonia l wars — like the one in Vietnam — to eradicating world hunger or t o making education and basic health care available to all people , including our own . I wondered how future generations would b e 48 \t Part II : 1971—1975 \t Jesus, Seen Differently 49"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"affected if we committed to alleviating the sources of misery and t o protecting watersheds, forests, and other natural areas that ensur e clean water, air, and the things that feed our spirits as well as ou r bodies . I could not believe that our Founding Fathers had e n v isione d the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness to exist only fo r Americans, so why were we now implementing strategies that pro- moted the imperialist values they had fought against ? On my last night in Indonesia, I awoke from a dream, sat up i n bed, and switched on the light . I had the feeling that someone wa s in the room with me . I peered around at the familiar Hotel Inter - Continental furniture, the batik tapestries, and the framed shado w puppets hanging on the walls . Then the dream came back . I had seen Christ standing in front of me . He seemed like th e same Jesus I had talked with every night when, as a young boy, I shared my thoughts with him after saying my formal prayers . Excep t that the Jesus of my childhood was fair-skinned and blond, whil e this one had curly black hair and a dark complexion . He bent dow n and heaved something up to his shoulder . I expected a cross . In - stead, I saw the axle of a car with the attached wheel rim protrudin g above his head, forming a metallic halo . Grease dripped like bloo d down his forehead . He straightened, peered into my eyes, and said , \"If I were to come now, you would see me differently .\" I asked hi m why . \"Because,\" he answered, \"the world has changed . \" The clock told me it was nearly daylight . I knew I could not g o back to sleep, so I dressed, took the elevator to the empty lobby, an d wandered into the gardens around the swimming pool . The moo n was bright ; the sweet smell of orchids filled the air . I sat down in a lounge chair and wondered what I was doing here, why the coinci- dences of my life had taken me along this path, why Indonesia . I knew my life had changed, but I had no idea how drastically . a- . Ann and I met in Paris on my way home, to attempt reconciliation . Even during this French vacation, however, we continued to quarrel .

I went to the Pru- dential Center headquarters first thing in the morning, and while I was standing with dozens of other employees at the elevator I learne d that Mac Hall, MAIN'S enigmatic, octogenarian chairman and CEO , had promoted Einar to president of the Portland, Oregon office . A s a result, I now officially reported to Bruno Zambotti . Nicknamed \"the silver fox\" because of the color of his hair an d his uncanny ability to outmaneuver everyone who challenged him , Bruno had the dapper good looks of Cary Grant . He was eloquent , and he held both an engineering degree and an MBA .

Is tha t right? \" I assured him it was . He stood up and offered me his hand . \"Congratulations . You'v e just been promoted . \" Perhaps I should have gone out and celebrated at a fancy restau- rant with other MAIN employees — or even by myself . However, m y mind was on Claudine . I was dying to tell her about my promotio n and all my experiences in Indonesia . She had warned me not to cal l her from abroad, and I had not . Now I was dismayed to find that he r phone was disconnected, with no forwarding number . I went look- ing for her . A young couple had moved into her apartment . It was lunchtim e but I believe I roused them from their bed ; obviously annoyed, the y professed to know nothing about Claudine . I paid a visit to the rea l estate agency, pretending to be a cousin . Their files indicated they ha d never rented to anyone with her name ; the previous lease had bee n issued to a man who would remain anonymous by his request . Bac k at the Prudential Center, MAIN's employment office also claimed t o have no record of her . They admitted only to a \"special consultants \" file that was not available for my scrutiny .

Looking down a distant street, I thought I saw he r walking toward me . I started for the door and then returned t o the window for another look . The woman had come closer . I coul d see that she was attractive, and that her walk was reminiscent o f Claudine's, but it was not Claudine . My heart sank, and my feeling s changed from anger and loathing to fear . An image flashed before me of Claudine flailing, falling in a rai n 52 \t Opportunity of a Lifetime 53"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"of bullets, assassinated . I shook it off, took a couple Valium, an d drank myself to sleep . The next morning, a call from MAIN'S personnel department wok e me from my stupor . Its chief, Paul Mormino, assured me he under - stood my need for rest, but he urged me to come in that afternoon . \"Good news,\" he said . \"The best thing for catching up with yourself . \" I obeyed the summons and learned that Bruno had been mor e than true to his word . I had not only been promoted to Howard's ol d job ; I had been given the title of Chief Economist and a raise . It di d cheer me up a bit . I took the afternoon off and wandered down along the Charle s River with a quart of beer . As I sat there, watching the sailboats an d nursing combined jet lag and vicious hangover, I convinced mysel f that Claudine had done her job and had moved on to her nex t assignment . She had always emphasized the need for secrecy . Sh e would call me . Mormino had been right . My jet lag — and my anxi- ety — dissipated . During the next weeks, I tried to put all thoughts of Claudin e aside . I focused on writing my report on the Indonesian econom y and on revising Howard's load forecasts . I came up with the type o f study my bosses wanted to see : a growth in electric demand averag - ing 19 percent per annum for twelve years after the new system wa s completed, tapering down to 17 percent for eight more years, an d then holding at 15 percent for the remainder of the twenty-five-yea r projection . I presented my conclusions at formal meetings with the interna- tional lending agencies . Their teams of experts questioned me ex- tensively and mercilessly . By then, my emotions had turned into a sort of grim determination, not unlike those that had driven me t o excel rather than to rebel during my prep school days . Nonetheless , Claudine's memory always hovered close . When a sassy youn g economist out to make a name for himself at the Asian Developmen t Bank grilled me relentlessly for an entire afternoon, I recalled th e advice Claudine had given me as we sat in her Beacon Street apart - ment those many months before . \"Who can see twenty-five years into the future?\" she had asked . \"Your guess is as good as theirs . Confidence is everything . \" I convinced myself I was an expert, reminding myself that I ha d experienced more of life in developing countries than many of the men — some of them twice my age — who now sat in judgment of m y work . I had lived in the Amazon and had traveled to parts of Java n o one else wanted to visit . I had taken a couple of intensive course s aimed at teaching executives the finer points of econometrics, an d I told myself that I was part of the new breed of statistically ori- ented, econometric-worshipping whiz kids that appealed to Rober t McNamara, the buttoned-down president of the World Bank, forme r president of Ford Motor Company, and John Kennedy's secretary o f defense . Here was a man who had built his reputation on numbers , on probability theory, on mathematical models, and — I suspected — on the bravado of a very large ego . I tried to emulate both McNamara and my boss, Bruno . I adopte d manners of speech that imitated the former, and I took to walkin g with the swagger of the latter, attache case swinging at my side . Looking back, I have to wonder at my gall . In truth, my expertis e was extremely limited, but what I lacked in training and knowledg e I made up for in audacity . And it worked . Eventually the team of experts stamped my re - ports with their seals of approval . During the ensuing months, I attended meetings in Tehran , Caracas, Guatemala City, London, Vienna, and Washington, DC . I met famous personalities, including the shah of Iran, the forme r presidents of several countries, and Robert McNamara himself . Lik e prep school, it was a world of men . I was amazed at how my new ti - tle and the accounts of my recent successes before the internationa l lending agencies affected other people's attitudes toward me . At first, all the attention went to my head . I began to think of my - self as a Merlin who could wave his wand over a country, causing i t suddenly to light up, industries sprouting like flowers . Then I becam e disillusioned . I questioned my own motives and those of all the peopl e I worked with . It seemed that a glorified title or a PhD did little t o help a person understand the plight of a leper living beside a cess - pool in Jakarta, and I doubted that a knack for manipulating statistic s enabled a person to see into the future . The better I came to kno w those who made the decisions that shape the world, the more skep- tical I became about their abilities and their goals . Looking at th e faces around the meeting room tables, I found myself struggling ver y hard to restrain my anger . Eventually, however, this perspective also changed .

Like Charlie, they were convinced that communism an d terrorism were evil forces — rather than the predictable reactions t o decisions they and their predecessors had made — and that they ha d a duty to their country, to their offspring, and to God to convert th e world to capitalism . They also clung to the principle of survival o f the fittest ; if they happened to enjoy the good fortune to have bee n born into a privileged class instead of inside a cardboard shack, the n they saw it as an obligation to pass this heritage on to their progeny . I vacillated between viewing such people as an actual conspirac y and simply seeing them as a tight-knit fraternity bent on dominatin g the world . Nonetheless, over time I began to liken them to the plan- tation owners of the pre-Civil War South . They were men draw n together in a loose association by common beliefs and shared self - interest, rather than an exclusive group meeting in clandestin e hideaways with focused and sinister intent . The plantation autocrat s had grown up with servants and slaves, had been educated to believ e that it was their right and even their duty to take care of the \"hea- thens\" and to convert them to the owners' religion and way of life . Even if slavery repulsed them philosophically, they could, lik e Thomas Jefferson, justify it as a necessity, the collapse of whic h would result in social and economic chaos . The leaders of the moder n oligarchies, what I now thought of as the corporatocracy, seemed t o fit the same mold . I also began to wonder who benefits from war and the mass pro - duction of weapons, from the damming of rivers and the destructio n of indigenous environments and cultures . I began to look at wh o benefits when hundreds of thousands of people die from insufficien t food, polluted water, or curable diseases . Slowly I came to realiz e that in the long run no one benefits, but in the short term those a t the top of the pyramid— my bosses and me — appear to benefit, a t least materially . This raised several other questions : Why does this situation persist ? Why has it endured for so long? Does the answer lie simply in th e old adage that \"might is right,\" that those with the power perpetuat e the system ? It seemed insufficient to say that power alone allows this situatio n to persist . While the proposition that might makes right explained a great deal, I felt there must be a more compelling force at work here . I recalled an economics professor from my business school days, a ma n from northern India, who lectured about limited resources, abou t ma n ' s need to grow continually, and about the principle of slave labor . According to this professor, all successful capitalist systems involv e hierarchies with rigid chains of command, including a handful at th e very top who control descending orders of subordinates, and a mas- sive army of workers at the bottom, who in relative economic term s truly can be classified as slaves . Ultimately, then, I became convince d that we encourage this system because the corporatocracy has con- vinced us that God has given us the right to place a few of our peo- ple at the very top of this capitalist pyramid and to export our syste m to the entire world . Of course, we are not the first to do this . The list of practitioner s stretches back to the ancient empires of North Africa, the Middl e East, and Asia, and works its way up through Persia, Greece, Rome , the Christian Crusades, and all the European empire builders of th e post-Columbian era . This imperialist drive has been and continue s to be the cause of most wars, pollution, starvation, species extinc- tions, and genocides . And it has always taken a serious toll on th e conscience and well-being of the citizens of those empires, contribut - ing to social malaise and resulting in a situation where the wealthies t cultures in human history are plagued with the highest rates of suicide , drug abuse, and violence . I thought extensively on these questions, but I avoided consider- ing the nature of my own role in all of this . I tried to think of mysel f not as an EHM but as a chief economist . It sounded so very legiti- mate, and if I needed any confirmation, I could look at my pay stubs : all were from MAIN, a private corporation . I didn't earn a penn y from the NSA or any government agency . And so I became con- vinced . Almost . One afternoon Bruno called me into his office . He walked behin d my chair and patted me on the shoulder . \"You've done an excellen t job,\" he purred . \"To show our appreciation, we're giving you the op- portunity of a lifetime, something few men ever receive, even a t twice your age . \" 56 \t Part II : 1971—1975 \t Opportunity of a Lifetime \t 57"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1 0 Panama's President and Her o I landed at Panama's Tocumen International Airport late one Apri l night in 1972, during a tropical deluge . As was common in thos e days, I shared a taxi with several other executives, and because I spoke Spanish, I ended up in the front seat beside the driver . I stare d blankly out the taxi's windshield . Through the rain, the headlight s illuminated a billboard portrait of a handsome man with a promi- nent brow and flashing eyes . One side of his wide-brimmed hat wa s hooked rakishly up . I recognized him as the hero of modern Panama , Omar Torrijos . I had prepared for this trip in my customary fashion, by visitin g the reference section of the Boston Public Library . I knew that one o f the reasons for Torrijos's popularity among his people was that h e was a firm defender of both Panama's right of self-rule and of it s claims to sovereignty over the Panama Canal . He was determine d that the country under his leadership would avoid the pitfalls of it s ignominious history . Panama was part of Colombia when the French engineer Ferdinan d de Lesseps, who directed construction of the Suez Canal, decided t o build a canal through the Central American isthmus, to connect th e Atlantic and Pacific oceans . Beginning in 1881, the French under - took a mammoth effort that met with one catastrophe after another . Finally, in 1889, the project ended in financial disaster—but it ha d inspired a dream in Theodore Roosevelt . During the first years of th e twentieth century, the United States demanded that Colombia sign a treaty turning the isthmus over to a North American consortium . Colombia refused . In 1903, President Roosevelt sent in the U .S . warship Nashville . U .S . soldiers landed, seized and killed a popular local militia com- mander, and declared Panama an independent nation . A puppe t government was installed and the first Canal Treaty was signed ; i t established an American zone on both sides of the future waterway , legalized U .S . military intervention, and gave Washington virtua l control over this newly formed \"independent\" nation . Interestingly, the treaty was signed by U .S . Secretary of State Ha y and a French engineer, Philippe Bunau-Varilla, who had been part o f the original team, but it was not signed by a single Panamanian . I n essence, Panama was forced to leave Colombia in order to serve th e United States, in a deal struck by an American and a Frenchman — in retrospect, a prophetic beginning . ' For more than half a century, Panama was ruled by an oligarch y of wealthy families with strong connections to Washington . The y were right-wing dictators who took whatever measures they deeme d necessary to ensure that their country promoted U .S . interests . I n the manner of most of the Latin American dictators who allied them - selves with Washington, Panama's rulers interpreted U .S . interests t o mean putting down any populist movement that smacked of social - ism . They also supported the CIA and NSA in anti-Communist ac- tivities throughout the hemisphere, and they helped big America n businesses like Rockefeller's Standard Oil and United Fruit Compan y (which was purchased by George H . W . Bush) . These government s apparently did not feel that U .S . interests were promoted by im- proving the lives of people who lived in dire poverty or served a s virtual slaves to the big plantations and corporations . Panama's ruling families were well rewarded for their support ; U .S . military forces intervened on their behalf a dozen times betwee n the declaration of Panamanian independence and 1968 . However , that year, while I was still a Peace Corps volunteer in Ecuador, th e course of Panamanian history suddenly changed . A coup overthre w Arnulfo Arias, the latest in the parade of dictators, and Omar Torrijo s emerged as the head of state, although he had not actively partici- pated in the coup . 2 Torrijos was highly regarded by the Panamanian middle an d lower classes . He himself had grown up in the rural city of Santiago , 58 \t Panama ' s President and Hero 59"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"where his parents taught school . He had risen quickly through th e ranks of the National Guard, Panama's primary military unit and a n institution that during the 1960s gained increasing support amon g the poor . Torrijos earned a reputation for listening to the dispos- sessed . He walked the streets of their shantytowns, held meetings i n slums politicians didn't dare to enter, helped the unemployed fin d jobs, and often donated his own limited financial resources to fam- ilies stricken by illness or tragedy - . 3 His love of life and his compassion for people reached eve n beyond Panama's borders . Torrijos was committed to turning hi s nation into a haven for fugitives from persecution, a place tha t would offer asylum to refugees from both sides of the political fence , from leftist opponents of Chile's Pinochet to right-wing anti-Castr o guerrillas . Many people saw him as an agent of peace, a perceptio n that earned him praise throughout the hemisphere . He also devel- oped a reputation as a leader who was dedicated to resolving differ - ences among the various factions that were tearing apart so man y Latin American countries : Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador , Nicaragua, Cuba, Colombia, Peru, Argentina, Chile, and Paraguay . His small nation of two million people served as a model of socia l reform and an inspiration for world leaders as diverse as the labo r organizers who plotted the dismemberment of the Soviet Union an d Islamic militants like Muammar Gadhafi of Libya . 4 My first night in Panama, stopped at the traffic light, peering pas t the noisy windshield wipers, I was moved by this man smiling dow n at me from the billboard —handsome, charismatic, and courageous . I knew from my hours at the BPL that he stood behind his beliefs . For the first time in its history, Panama was not a puppet of Wash - ington or of anyone else . Torrijos never succumbed to the tempta- tions offered by Moscow or Beijing ; he believed in social reform an d in helping those born into poverty, but he did not advocate commu - nism . Unlike Castro, Torrijos was determined to win freedom fro m the United States without forging alliances with the United States ' enemies . I had stumbled across an article in some obscure journal in th e BPL racks that praised Torrijos as a man who would alter the histor y of the Americas, reversing a long-term trend toward U .S . domina- tion . The author cited as his starting point Manifest Destiny—th e doctrine, popular with many Americans during the 1840s, that the conquest of North America was divinely ordained ; that God, no t men, had ordered the destruction of Indians, forests, and buffalo , the draining of swamps and the channeling of rivers, and the devel - opment of an economy that depends on the continuing exploitatio n of labor and natural resources . The article got me to thinking about my country's attitude towar d the world . The Monroe Doctrine, originally enunciated by Presiden t James Monroe in 1823, was used to take Manifest Destiny a step fur - ther when, in the 1850s and 1860s, it was used to assert that th e United States had special rights all over the hemisphere, includin g the right to invade any nation in Central or South America that re - fused to back U .S . policies . Teddy Roosevelt invoked the Monro e Doctrine to justify U .S . intervention in the Dominican Republic, i n Venezuela, and during the \"liberation\" of Panama from Colombia . A string of subsequent U .S . presidents—most notably Taft, Wilson , and Franklin Roosevelt — relied on it to expand Washington's Pan - American activities through the end of World War II . Finally, durin g the latter half of the twentieth century, the United States used th e Communist threat to justify expansion of this concept to countrie s around the globe, including Vietnam and Indonesia . ' Now, it seemed, one man was standing in Washington's way . I knew that he was not the first — leaders like Castro and Allende ha d gone before him — but Torrijos alone was doing it outside the real m of Communist ideology and without claiming that his movemen t was a revolution . He was simply saying that Panama had its ow n rights — to sovereignty over its people, its lands, and a waterway tha t bisected it — and that these rights were as valid and as divinely be - stowed as any enjoyed by the United States . Torrijos also objected to the School of the Americas and to th e U .S . Southern Command's tropical warfare training center, both lo - cated in the Canal Zone . For years, the United States armed force s had in v ited Latin American dictators and presidents to send thei r sons and military leaders to these facilities—the largest and bes t equipped outside North America . There, they learned interrogatio n and covert operational skills as well as military tactics that the y would use to fight communism and to protect their own assets an d those of the oil companies and other private corporations . They als o had opportunities to bond with the United States' top brass . These facilities were hated by Latin Americans — except for th e 60 \t Part II : 1971—1975 \t Panama ' s President and Hero \t 61"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"few wealthy ones who benefited from them . They were known t o provide schooling for right-wing death squads and the torturers wh o had turned so many nations into totalitarian regimes . Torrijos mad e it clear that he did not want training centers located in Panama — an d that he considered the Canal Zone to be included within his borders . 6 Seeing the handsome general on the billboard, and reading th e caption beneath his face — \"Omar's ideal is freedom ; the missile i s not invented that can kill an ideal!\"—I felt a shiver run down m y spine . I had a premonition that the story of Panama in the twentiet h century was far from over, and that Torrijos was in for a difficult an d perhaps even tragic time . The tropical storm battered against the windshield, the traffi c light turned green, and the driver honked his horn at the car ahea d of us . I thought about my own position . I had been sent to Panam a to close the deal on what would become MAIN's first truly com- prehensive master development plan . This plan would create a jus- tification for World Bank, Inter-American Development Bank, an d USAID investment of billions of dollars in the energy, transporta- tion, and agricultural sectors of this tiny and very crucial country . I t was, of course, a subterfuge, a means of making Panama foreve r indebted and thereby returning it to its puppet status .

CHAPTER 1 1 Pirates in the Canal Zon e The next day, the Panamanian government sent a man to show m e around . His name was Fidel, and I was immediately drawn to him . He was tall and slim and took an obvious pride in his country . Hi s great-great-grandfather had fought beside Bolivar to win indepen- dence from Spain . I told him I was related to Tom Paine, and wa s thrilled to learn that Fidel had read Common Sense in Spanish . H e spoke English, but when he discovered I was fluent in the languag e of his country, he was overcome with emotion . \"Many of your people live here for years and never bother to lear n it,\" he said . Fidel took me on a drive through an impressively prosperous secto r of his city, which he called the New Panama . As we passed moder n glass-and-steel skyscrapers, he explained that Panama had more in- ternational banks than any other country south of the Rio Grande . \"We're often called the Switzerland of the Americas,\" he said . \"W e ask very few questions of our clients . \" Late in the afternoon, with the sun sliding toward the Pacific, w e headed out on an avenue that followed the contours of the bay . A long line of ships was anchored there . I asked Fidel whether ther e was a problem with the canal . \"It's always like this,\" he replied with a laugh . \"Lines of them , waiting their turn . Half the traffic is coming from or going t o Japan . More even than the United States . \" I confessed that this was news to me . 62 \t Part II : 1971—1975 \t 63"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"\"I ' m not surprised, \" he said . \"North Americans don ' t know muc h about the rest of the world . \" We stopped at a beautiful park in which bougainvillea crept ove r ancient ruins . A sign proclaimed that this was a fort built to protec t the city against marauding English pirates . A family was setting u p for an evening picnic : a father, mother, son and daughter, and a n elderly man who I assumed was the children's grandfather . I felt a sudden longing for the tranquility that seemed to embrace these fiv e people . As we passed them, the couple smiled, waved, and greeted u s in English . I asked if they were tourists, and they laughed . The ma n came over to us . \"I'm third generation in the Canal Zone,\" he explained proudly . \"My granddad came three years after it was created . He drove one o f the mules, the tractors that hauled ships through the locks .\" H e pointed at the elderly man, who was preoccupied helping the chil- dren set the picnic table . \"My dad was an engineer and I've followe d in his footsteps . \" The woman had returned to helping her father-in-law and chil- dren . Beyond them, the sun dipped into the blue water . It was a scene of idyllic beauty, reminiscent of a Monet painting . I asked th e man if they were U .S . citizens . He looked at me incredulously . \"Of course . The Canal Zone is U .S . territory .\" The boy ran up to tell his father that dinner was ready . \"Will your son be the fourth generation? \" The man brought his hands together in a sign of prayer an d raised them toward the sky . \"I pray to the good Lord every day that he may have that oppor- tunity . Living in the Zone is a wonderful life .\" Then he lowered hi s hands and stared directly at Fidel . \"I just hope we can hold on to he r for another fifty years . That despot Torrijos is making a lot o f waves . A dangerous man . \" A sudden urge gripped me, and I said to him, in Spanish, `Adios . I hope you and your family have a good time here, and learn lot s about Panama's culture . \" He gave me a disgusted look . \"I don't speak their language,\" h e said . Then he turned abruptly and headed toward his family and th e picnic . Fidel stepped close to me, placed an arm around my shoulders , and squeezed tightly . \"Thank you,\" he said . Back in the city, Fidel drove us through an area he described a s a slum . \" Not our worst,\" he said . \"But you ' ll get the flavor . \" Wooden shacks and ditches filled with standing water lined th e street, the frail homes suggesting dilapidated boats scuttled in a cesspool . The smell of rot and sewage filled our car as children wit h distended bellies ran alongside . When we slowed, they congregate d at my side, calling me uncle and begging for money . It reminded m e of Jakarta . Graffiti covered many of the walls . There were a few of the usua l hearts with couples' names scrawled inside, but most of the graffit i were slogans expressing hatred of the United States : \"Go home , gringo,\" \"Stop shitting in our canal,\" \"Uncle Sam, slave master,\" an d \"Tell Nixon that Panama is not Vietnam .\" The one that chilled m y heart the most, however, read, \"Death for freedom is the way to Christ . \" Scattered among these were posters of Omar Torrijos . \"Now the other side,\" Fidel said . \"I've got official papers and you'r e a U .S . citizen, so we can go .\" Beneath a magenta sky he drove us int o the Canal Zone . As prepared as I thought I was, it was not enough . I could hardly believe the opulence of the place — huge white build- ings, manicured lawns, plush homes, golf courses, stores, and the- aters . \"The facts,\" he said . \"Everything in here is U .S . property . All th e businesses —the supermarkets, barbershops, beauty salons, restau- rants, all of them—are exempt from Panamanian laws and taxes . There are seven 18-hole golf courses, U .S . post offices scattered con- veniently around, U .S . courts of law and schools . It truly is a countr y within a country \" \"What an affront! \" Fidel peered at me as though rnaking a quick assessment . \"Yes, \" he agreed . \"That's a pretty good word for it . Over there,\" he pointe d back toward the city, \"income per capita is less than one thousan d dollars a year, and unemployment rates are 30 percent . Of course, i n the little shantytown we just visited, no one makes close to one thou - sand dollars, and hardly anyone has a job . \" \"What's being done? \" He turned and gave me a look that seemed to change from ange r to sadness . \"What can we do?\" He shook his head . \"I don't know, but I'll sa y 64 \t Part II : 1971-1975 \t Pirates in the Canal Zone 65"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Ct : this : Torrijos is trying .

As we walked on, Fidel explained that Panamanian women wer e prohibited by law from prostitution . \"They can tend bar and dance , but cannot sell their bodies .

A couple o f burly U .S . soldiers stood near the door ; bands around their uniforme d arms identified them as MPs . Fidel led me along a bar, and then I saw the stage . Three youn g women were dancing there, entirely naked except for their heads . One wore a sailor's cap, another a green beret, and the third a cowbo y hat . They had spectacular figures and were laughing . They seeme d to be playing a game with one another, as though dancing in a com- petition . The music, the way they danced, the stage—it could hav e been a disco in Boston, except that they were naked . We pushed our way through a group of young English-speakin g men . Although they wore T-shirts and blue jeans, their crew cut s gave them away as soldiers from the Canal Zone's military base . Fi- del tapped a waitress on the shoulder . She turned, let out a scream o f delight, and threw her arms around him . The group of young me n watched this intently, glancing at one another with disapproval . I wondered if they thought Manifest Destiny included this Panaman- ian woman . The waitress led us to a corner . From somewhere, sh e produced a small table and two chairs . As we settled in, Fidel exchanged greetings in Spanish with tw o men at a table beside ours . Unlike the soldiers, they wore printe d short-sleeved shirts and creased slacks . The waitress returned wit h a couple of Balboa beers, and Fidel patted her on the rump as she turned to leave . She smiled and threw him a kiss . I glanced aroun d and was relieved to discover that the young men at the bar were n o longer watching us ; they were focused on the dancers . The majority of the patrons were English-speaking soldiers, bu t there were others, like the two beside us, who obviously were Pana- manians . They stood out because their hair would not have passe d inspection, and because they did not wear T-shirts and jeans . A fe w of them sat at tables, others leaned against the walls . They seemed t o be highly alert, like border collies guarding flocks of sheep . Women roamed the tables . They moved constantly, sitting on laps , shouting to the waitresses, dancing, swirling, singing, taking turn s on the stage . They wore tight skirts, T-shirts, jeans, clinging dresses , high heels . One was dressed in a Victorian gown and veil . Anothe r wore only a bikini . It was obvious that only the most beautiful coul d survive here . I marveled at the numbers who made their way to Pana - ma and wondered at the desperation that had driven them to this . 'All from other countries?\" I shouted to Fidel above the music . He nodded . \"Except . . .\" He pointed at the waitresses . \"They'r e Panamanian . \" \"Wnat countries? \" \"Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Guatemala . \" \"Neighbors . \" \"Not entirely . Costa Rica and Colombia are our closest neighbors . \" The waitress who had led us to this table came and sat on Fidel' s knee . He gently rubbed her back . \"Clarissa,\" he said, \"please tell my North American friend wh y they left their countries .\" He nodded his head in the direction of th e stage .

One morning during tha t same 1972 visit, I was sitting in an office I had been given at the In- stituto de Recursos Hidraulicos y Electrificacion, Panama's govern- ment-owned electric utility company . I was poring over a sheet o f statistics when a man knocked gently on the frame of my open door . I invited him in, pleased with any excuse to take my attention off th e numbers . He announced himself as the general's chauffeur and sai d he had come to take me to one of the general's bungalows . An hour later, I was sitting across the table from General Oma r Torrijos . He was dressed casually, in typical Panamanian style : khak i slacks and a short-sleeved shirt buttoned down the front, light blu e with a delicate green pattern . He was tall, fit, and handsome . H e seemed amazingly relaxed for a man with his responsibilities . A loc k of dark hair fell over his prominent forehead . He asked about my recent travels to Indonesia, Guatemala, an d Iran . The three countries fascinated him, but he seemed especiall y intrigued with Iran's king, Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi . The sha h had come to power in 1941, after the British and Soviets overthre w his father, whom they accused of collaborating with Hitler . l \"Can you imagine, Torrijos asked, \"being part of a plot to dethron e your own father? \" Panama's head of state knew a good deal about the history of thi s far-off land . We talked about how the tables were turned on the sha h 70 \t Part II : 1971—1975 \t 71"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"in 1951, and how his own premier, Mohammad Mossadegh, force d him into exile . Torrijos knew, as did most of the world, that it ha d been the CIA that labeled the premier a Communist and that steppe d in to restore the shah to power . However, he did not know—or a t least did not mention —the parts Claudine had shared with me , about Kermit Roosevelt's brilliant maneuvers and the fact that thi s had been the beginning of a new era in imperialism, the match tha t had ignited the global empire conflagration . \"After the shah was reinstated,\" Torrijos continued, \"he launche d a series of revolutionary programs aimed at developing the indus- trial sector and bringing Iran into the modern era . \" I asked him how he happened to know so much about Iran . \"I make it my point,\" he said . \"I don't think too highly of the shah' s politics —his willingness to overthrow his own father and become a CIA puppet—but it looks as though he's doing good things for hi s country . Perhaps I can learn something from him . If he survives . \" \"You think he won't? \" \"He has powerful enemies . \" \"And some of the world's best bodyguards . \" Torrijos gave me a sardonic look . \"His secret police, SAVAK, hav e the reputation of being ruthless thugs . That doesn't win many friends . He won't last much longer .\" He paused, then rolled his eyes . \"Body - guards? I have a few myself\" He waved at the door . \"You think they'l l save my life if your country decides to get rid of me? \" I asked whether he truly saw that as a possibility . He raised his eyebrows in a manner that made me feel foolish fo r asking such a question . \"We have the Canal . That's a lot bigger tha n Arbenz and United Fruit . \" I had researched Guatemala, and I understood Torrijos's mean- ing . United Fruit Company had been that country's political equiva- lent of Panama's canal . Founded in the late 1800s, United Fruit soo n grew into one of the most powerful forces in Central America . Dur- ing the early 1950s, reform candidate Jacobo Arbenz was electe d president of Guatemala in an election hailed all over the hemispher e as a model of the democratic process . At the time, less than 3 percen t of Guatemalans owned 70 percent of the land . Arbenz promised t o help the poor dig their way out of starvation, and after his electio n he implemented a comprehensive land reform program . \"The poor and middle classes throughout Latin America ap - plauded Arbenz,\" Torrijos said . \"Personally, he was one of my heroes . But we also held our breath . We knew that United Fruit oppose d these measures, since they were one of the largest and most oppres- sive landholders in Guatemala . They also owned big plantations i n Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Jamaica, Nicaragua, Santo Domingo , and here in Panama . They couldn't afford to let Arbenz give the res t of us ideas . \" I knew the rest : United Fruit had launched a major public rela- tions campaign in the United States, aimed at convincing the Amer- ican public and congress that Arbenz was part of a Russian plot an d that Guatemala was a Soviet satellite . In 1954, the CIA orchestrate d a coup . American pilots bombed Guatemala City and the democrat- ically elected Arbenz was overthrown, replaced by Colonel Carlo s Castillo Armas, a ruthless right-wing dictator . The new government owed everything to United Fruit . By way o f thanks, the government reversed the land reform process, abolishe d taxes on the interest and dividends paid to foreign investors, elimi- nated the secret ballot, and jailed thousands of its critics . Anyone wh o dared to speak out against Castillo was persecuted . Historians trac e the violence and terrorism that plagued Guatemala for most of th e rest of the century to the not-so-secret alliance between United Fruit , the CIA, and the Guatemalan army under its colonel dictator . 2 \"Arbenz was assassinated,\" Torrijos continued . \"Political an d character assassination .\" He paused and frowned . \"How could you r people swallow that CIA rubbish? I won't go so easily . The militar y here are my people . Political assassination won't do .\" He smiled . \"The CIA itself will have to kill me! \" We sat in silence for a few moments, each lost in his own thoughts . Torrijos was the first to speak . \"Do you know who owns United Fruit?\" he asked . \"Zapata Oil, George Bush's company—our UN ambassador .\" I said . \"A man with ambitions .\" He leaned forward and lowered hi s voice . \"And now I'm up against his cronies at Bechtel . \" This startled me . Bechtel was the world's most powerful engi- neering firm and a frequent collaborator on projects with MAIN . I n the case of Panama's master plan, I had assumed that they were on e of our major competitors . \"What do you mean? \" 72 \t Part II : 1971—1975 \t Conversations with the General \t 73"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"understand that most of those men believed they were doing th e right thing . Like Charlie, they were con v inced that communism an d terrorism were evil forces — rather than the predictable reactions t o decisions they and their predecessors had made — and that they ha d a duty to their country, to their offspring, and to God to convert th e world to capitalism . They also clung to the principle of survival o f the fittest ; if they happened to enjoy the good fortune to have bee n born into a privileged class instead of inside a cardboard shack, the n they saw it as an obligation to pass this heritage on to their progeny . I vacillated between viewing such people as an actual conspirac y and simply seeing them as a tight-knit fraternity bent on dominatin g the world . Nonetheless, over time I began to liken them to the plan- tation owners of the pre-Civil War South . They were men draw n together in a loose association by common beliefs and shared self - interest, rather than an exclusive group meeting in clandestin e hideaways with focused and sinister intent . The plantation autocrat s had grown up with servants and slaves, had been educated to believ e that it was their right and even their duty to take care of the \"hea- thens\" and to convert them to the owners' religion and way of life . Even if slavery repulsed them philosophically, they could, lik e Thomas Jefferson, justify it as a necessity, the collapse of whic h would result in social and economic chaos . The leaders of the moder n oligarchies, what I now thought of as the corporatocracy, seemed t o fit the same mold . I also began to wonder who benefits from war and the mass pro - duction of weapons, from the damming of rivers and the destructio n of indigenous environments and cultures . I began to look at wh o benefits when hundreds of thousands of people die from insufficien t food, polluted water, or curable diseases . Slowly, I came to realiz e that in the long run no one benefits, but in the short term those a t the top of the pyramid—my bosses and me — appear to benefit, a t least materially . This raised several other questions : Why does this situation persist ? Why has it endured for so long? Does the answer lie simply in th e old adage that \"might is right ; that those with the power perpetuat e the system ? It seemed insufficient to say that power alone allows this situatio n to persist . While the proposition that might makes right explained a great deal, I felt there must be a more compelling force at work here . I recalled an economics professor from my business school days, a ma n from northern India, who lectured about limited resources, abou t man's need to grow continually, and about the principle of slave labor . According to this professor, all successful capitalist systems involv e hierarchies with rigid chains of command, including a handful at th e very top who control descending orders of subordinates, and a mas- sive army of workers at the bottom, who in relative economic term s truly can be classified as slaves . Ultimately, then, I became co n v ince d that we encourage this system because the corporatocracy has con- vinced us that God has given us the right to place a few of our peo- ple at the very top of this capitalist pyramid and to export our syste m to the entire world . Of course, we are not the first to do this . The list of practitioner s stretches back to the ancient empires of North Africa, the Middl e East, and Asia, and works its way up through Persia, Greece, Rome , the Christian Crusades, and all the European empire builders of th e post-Columbian era . This imperialist drive has been and continue s to be the cause of most wars, pollution, starvation, species extinc- tions, and genocides . And it has always taken a serious toll on th e conscience and well-being of the citizens of those empires, contribut - ing to social malaise and resulting in a situation where the wealthies t cultures in human history are plagued with the highest rates of suicide , drug abuse, and violence . I thought extensively on these questions, but I avoided consider- ing the nature of my own role in all of this . I tried to think of mysel f not as an EHM but as a chief economist . It sounded so very legiti- mate, and if I needed any confirmation, I could look at my pay stubs : all were from MAIN, a private corporation . I didn't earn a penn y from the NSA or any government agency . And so I became con- vinced . Almost . One afternoon Bruno called me into his office . He walked behin d my chair and patted me on the shoulder . \"You've done an excellen t job,\" he purred . \"To show our appreciation, we're giving you the op - portunity of a lifetime, something few men ever receive, even a t twice your age . \" 56 \t Part II : 1971—1975 \t Opportunity of a Lifetime \t 57"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"_ CHAPTER 1 0 Panama's President and Her o I landed at Panama's Tocumen International Airport late one Apri l night in 1972, during a tropical deluge . As was common in thos e days, I shared a taxi with several other executives, and because I spoke Spanish, I ended up in the front seat beside the driver . I stare d blankly out the taxi's windshield . Through the rain, the headlight s illuminated a billboard portrait of a handsome man with a promi- nent brow and flashing eyes . One side of his wide-brimmed hat wa s hooked rakishly up . I recognized him as the hero of modern Panama , Omar Torrijos . I had prepared for this trip in my customary fashion, by visitin g the reference section of the Boston Public Library . I knew that one o f the reasons for Torrijos's popularity among his people was that h e was a firm defender of both Panama's right of self-rule and of it s claims to sovereignty over the Panama Canal . He was determine d that the country under his leadership would avoid the pitfalls of it s ignominious history . Panama was part of Colombia when the French engineer Ferdinan d de Lesseps, who directed construction of the Suez Canal, decided t o build a canal through the Central American isthmus, to connect th e Atlantic and Pacific oceans . Beginning in 1881, the French under - took a mammoth effort that met with one catastrophe after another . Finally, in 1889, the project ended in financial disaster — but it ha d inspired a dream in Theodore Roosevelt . During the first years of th e twentieth century, the United States demanded that Colombia sign a treaty turning the isthmus over to a North American consortium . Colombia refused . In 1903, President Roosevelt sent in the U .S . warship Nashville . U .S . soldiers landed, seized and killed a popular local militia com- mander, and declared Panama an independent nation . A puppe t government was installed and the first Canal Treaty was signed ; i t established an American zone on both sides of the future waterway , legalized U .S . military intervention, and gave Washington virtua l control over this newly formed \"independent\" nation . Interestingly, the treaty was signed by U .S . Secretary of State Ha y and a French engineer, Philippe Bunau-Varilla, who had been part o f the original team, but it was not signed by a single Panamanian . I n essence, Panama was forced to leave Colombia in order to serve th e United States, in a deal struck by an American and a Frenchman — in retrospect, a prophetic beginning . ) For more than half a century, Panama was ruled by an oligarch y of wealthy families with strong connections to Washington . The y were right-wing dictators who took whatever measures they deeme d necessary to ensure that their country promoted U .S . interests . I n the manner of most of the Latin American dictators who allied them - selves with Washington, Panama's rulers interpreted U .S . interests t o mean putting down any populist movement that smacked of social - ism . They also supported the CIA and NSA in anti-Communist ac- tivities throughout the hemisphere, and they helped big America n businesses like Rockefeller's Standard Oil and United Fruit Compan y (which was purchased by George H . W . Bush) . These government s apparently did not feel that U .S . interests were promoted by im- proving the lives of people who lived in dire poverty or served a s virtual slaves to the big plantations and corporations . Panama's ruling families were well rewarded for their support ; U .S . military forces intervened on their behalf a dozen times betwee n the declaration of Panamanian independence and 1968 . However , that year, while I was still a Peace Corps volunteer in Ecuador, th e course of Panamanian history suddenly changed . A coup overthre w Arnulfo Arias, the latest in the parade of dictators, and Omar Torrijo s emerged as the head of state, although he had not actively partici- pated in the coup . 2 Torrijos was highly regarded by the Panamanian middle an d lower classes . He himself had grown up in the rural city of Santiago , 58 \t Panama ' s President and Hero 59"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"where his parents taught school . He had risen quickly through th e ranks of the National Guard, Panama's primary military unit and a n institution that during the 1960s gained increasing support amon g the poor . Torrijos earned a reputation for listening to the dispos- sessed . He walked the streets of their shantytowns, held meetings i n slums politicians didn't dare to enter, helped the unemployed fin d jobs, and often donated his own limited financial resources to fam- ilies stricken by illness or tragedy . 3 His love of life and his compassion for people reached eve n beyond Panama's borders . Torrijos was committed to turning hi s nation into a haven for fugitives from persecution, a place tha t would offer asylum to refugees from both sides of the political fence , from leftist opponents of Chile's Pinochet to right-wing anti-Castr o guerrillas . Many people saw him as an agent of peace, a perceptio n that earned him praise throughout the hemisphere . He also devel- oped a reputation as a leader who was dedicated to resolving differ- ences among the various factions that were tearing apart so man y Latin American countries : Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador , Nicaragua, Cuba, Colombia, Peru, Argentina, Chile, and Paraguay . His small nation of two million people served as a model of socia l reform and an inspiration for world leaders as diverse as the labo r organizers who plotted the dismemberment of the Soviet Union an d Islamic militants like Muammar Gadhafi of Libya . 4 My first night in Panama, stopped at the traffic light, peering pas t the noisy windshield wipers, I was moved by this man smiling dow n at me from the billboard—handsome, charismatic, and courageous . I knew from my hours at the BPL that he stood behind his beliefs . For the first time in its history, Panama was not a puppet of Wash- ington or of anyone else . Torrijos never succumbed to the tempta- tions offered by Moscow or Beijing ; he believed in social reform an d in helping those born into poverty, but he did not advocate commu- nism . Unlike Castro, Torrijos was determined to win freedom fro m the United States without forging alliances with the United States ' enemies . I had stumbled across an article in some obscure journal in th e BPL racks that praised Torrijos as a man who would alter the histor y of the Americas, reversing a long-term trend toward U .S . domina- tion . The author cited as his starting point Manifest Destiny—th e doctrine, popular with many Americans during the 1840s, that the conquest of North America was divinely ordained ; that God, no t men, had ordered the destruction of Indians, forests, and buffalo , the draining of swamps and the channeling of rivers, and the devel- opment of an economy that depends on the continuing exploitatio n of labor and natural resources . The article got me to thinking about my country's attitude towar d the world . The Monroe Doctrine, originally enunciated by Presiden t James Monroe in 1823, was used to take Manifest Destiny a step fur - ther when, in the 1850s and 1860s, it was used to assert that th e United States had special rights all over the hemisphere, includin g the right to invade any nation in Central or South America that re - fused to back U .S . policies . Teddy Roosevelt invoked the Monro e Doctrine to justify U .S . intervention in the Dominican Republic, i n Venezuela, and during the \"liberation\" of Panama from Colombia . A string of subsequent U .S . presidents—most notably Taft, Wilson , and Franklin Roosevelt —relied on it to expand Washington's Pan - American activities through the end of World War II . Finally, durin g the latter half of the twentieth century, the United States used th e Communist threat to justify expansion of this concept to countrie s around the globe, including Vietnam and Indonesia . 5 Now, it seemed, one man was standing in Washington's way . I knew that he was not the first — leaders like Castro and Allende ha d gone before him —but Torrijos alone was doing it outside the real m of Communist ideology and without claiming that his movemen t was a revolution . He was simply saying that Panama had its ow n rights — to sovereignty over its people, its lands, and a waterway tha t bisected it — and that these rights were as valid and as divinely be - stowed as any enjoyed by the United States . Torrijos also objected to the School of the Americas and to th e U .S . Southern Command's tropical warfare training center, both lo- cated in the Canal Zone . For years, the United States armed force s had invited Latin American dictators and presidents to send thei r sons and military leaders to these facilities —the largest and bes t equipped outside North America . There, they learned interrogatio n and covert operational skills as well as military tactics that the y would use to fight communism and to protect their own assets an d those of the oil companies and other private corporations . They als o had opportunities to bond with the United States' top brass . These facilities were hated by Latin Americans — except for th e 60 Part II : 1971—1975 \t Panama ' s President and Hero 61"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"a : . few wealthy ones who benefited from them . They were known t o provide schooling for right-wing death squads and the torturers wh o had turned so many nations into totalitarian regimes . Torrijos mad e it clear that he did not want training centers located in Panama — an d that he considered the Canal Zone to be included within his borders . 6 Seeing the handsome general on the billboard, and reading th e caption beneath his face —\"Omar's ideal is freedom ; the missile i s not invented that can kill an ideal!\"—I felt a shiver run down m y spine . I had a premonition that the story of Panama in the twentiet h century was far from over, and that Torrijos was in for a difficult an d perhaps even tragic time . The tropical storm battered against the windshield, the traffi c light turned green, and the driver honked his horn at the car ahea d of us . I thought about my own position . I had been sent to Panam a to close the deal on what would become MAIN's first truly com- prehensive master development plan . This plan would create a jus- tification for World Bank, Inter-American Development Bank, an d USAID investment of billions of dollars in the energy, transporta- tion, and agricultural sectors of this tiny and very crucial country . I t was, of course, a subterfuge, a means of making Panama foreve r indebted and thereby returning it to its puppet status .

I ha d taken the plunge in Java, sold my soul, and now I could create m y opportunity of a lifetime . I could become rich, famous, and power- ful in one blow . CHAPTER 1 1 Pirates in the Canal Zon e The next day, the Panamanian government sent a man to show m e around . His name was Fidel, and I was immediately drawn to him . He was tall and slim and took an obvious pride in his country . Hi s great-great-grandfather had fought beside Bolivar to win indepen- dence from Spain . I told him I was related to Tom Paine, and wa s thrilled to learn that Fidel had read Common Sense in Spanish . H e spoke English, but when he discovered I was fluent in the languag e of his country, he was overcome with emotion . \"Many of your people live here for years and never bother to lear n it,\" he said . Fidel took me on a drive through an impressively prosperous secto r of his city ; which he called the New Panama . As we passed moder n glass-and-steel skyscrapers, he explained that Panama had more in- ternational banks than any other country south of the Rio Grande . \"We're often called the Switzerland of the Americas,\" he said . \"W e ask very few questions of our clients . \" Late in the afternoon, with the sun sliding toward the Pacific, w e headed out on an avenue that followed the contours of the bay . A long line of ships was anchored there . I asked Fidel whether ther e was a problem with the canal . \"It's always like this,\" he replied with a laugh . \"Lines of them , waiting their turn . Half the traffic is coming from or going t o Japan . More even than the United States . \" I confessed that this was news to me . 62 \t Part II : 1971—1975 \t 63"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"\"I'm not surprised,\" he said . \"North Americans don't know muc h about the rest of the world . \" We stopped at a beautiful park in which bougainvillea crept ove r ancient ruins . A sign proclaimed that this was a fort built to protec t the city against marauding English pirates . A family was setting u p for an evening picnic : a father, mother, son and daughter, and a n elderly man who I assumed was the children's grandfather . I felt a sudden longing for the tranquility that seemed to embrace these fiv e people . As we passed them, the couple smiled, waved, and greeted u s in English . I asked if they were tourists, and they laughed . The ma n came over to us . \"I'm third generation in the Canal Zone,\" he explained proudly . \"My granddad came three years after it was created . He drove one o f the mules, the tractors that hauled ships through the locks .\" H e pointed at the elderly man, who was preoccupied helping the chil- dren set the picnic table . \"My dad was an engineer and I've followe d in his footsteps . \" The woman had returned to helping her father-in-law and chil- dren . Beyond them, the sun dipped into the blue water . It was a scene of idyllic beauty, reminiscent of a Monet painting . I asked th e man if they were U .S . citizens . He looked at me incredulously . \"Of course . The Canal Zone is U .S . territory .\" The boy ran up to tell his father that dinner was ready . \"Will your son be the fourth generation? \" The man brought his hands together in a sign of prayer an d raised them toward the sky . \"I pray to the good Lord every day that he may have that oppor- tunity . Living in the Zone is a wonderful life .\" Then he lowered hi s hands and stared directly at Fidel . \"I just hope we can hold on to he r for another fifty years . That despot Torrijos is making a lot o f waves . A dangerous man . \" A sudden urge gripped me, and I said to him, in Spanish, \"Adios . I hope you and your family have a good time here, and learn lot s about Panama's culture . \" He gave me a disgusted look . \"I don't speak their language,\" h e said . Then he turned abruptly and headed toward his family and th e picnic . Fidel stepped close to me, placed an arm around my shoulders , and squeezed tightly . \"Thank you,\" he said . Back in the city, Fidel drove us through an area he described a s a slum . \"Not our worst, \" he said . \" But you ' ll get the flavor . \" Wooden shacks and ditches filled with standing water lined th e street, the frail homes suggesting dilapidated boats scuttled in a cesspool . The smell of rot and sewage filled our car as children wit h distended bellies ran alongside . When we slowed, they congregate d at my side, calling me uncle and begging for money . It reminded m e of Jakarta . Graffiti covered many of the walls . There were a few of the usua l hearts with couples' names scrawled inside, but most of the graffit i were slogans expressing hatred of the United States : \"Go home , gringo,\" \"Stop shifting in our canal,\" \"Uncle Sam, slave master,\" an d \"Tell Nixon that Panama is not Vietnam .\" The one that chilled m y heart the most, however, read, \"Death for freedom is the way to Christ . \" Scattered among these were posters of Omar Torrijos . \"Now the other side,\" Fidel said . \"I've got official papers and you'r e a U .S . citizen, so we can go .\" Beneath a magenta sky, he drove us int o the Canal Zone . As prepared as I thought I was, it was not enough . I could hardly believe the opulence of the place — huge white build- ings, manicured lawns, plush homes, golf courses, stores, and the- aters . \"The facts,\" he said . \"Everything in here is U .S . property . All th e businesses — the supermarkets, barbershops, beauty salons, restau- rants, all of them—are exempt from Panamanian laws and taxes . There are seven 18-hole golf courses, U .S . post offices scattered con - veniently around, U .S . courts of law and schools . It truly is a countr y within a country . \" \"What an affront! \" Fidel peered at me as though making a quick assessment . \"Yes, \" he agreed . \"That's a pretty good word for it . Over there,\" he pointe d back toward the city, \"income per capita is less than one thousan d dollars a year, and unemployment rates are 30 percent . Of course, i n the little shantytown we just visited, no one makes close to one thou - sand dollars, and hardly anyone has a job . \" \"What's being done? \" He turned and gave me a look that seemed to change from ange r to sadness . \"What can we do?\" He shook his head . \"I don't know, but I'll sa y 64 \t Part II : 1971—1975 \t Pirates in the Canal Zone \t 65"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"' V this : Torrijos is trying .

As we walked on, Fidel explained that Panamanian women wer e prohibited by law from prostitution . \"They can tend bar and dance , but cannot sell their bodies . That's left to the imports . \" We stepped inside the bar and were blasted with a popular Amer - ican song . My eyes and ears took a moment to adjust . A couple o f burly U .S . soldiers stood near the door ; bands around their uniforme d arms identified them as MPs . Fidel led me along a bar, and then I saw the stage . Three youn g women were dancing there, entirely naked except for their heads . One wore a sailor's cap, another a green beret, and the third a cowbo y hat . They had spectacular figures and were laughing . They seeme d to be playing a game with one another, as though dancing in a com- petition . The music, the way they danced, the stage — it could hav e been a disco in Boston, except that they were naked . We pushed our way through a group of young English-speakin g men . Although they wore T-shirts and blue jeans, their crew cut s gave them away as soldiers from the Canal Zone's military base . Fi- del tapped a waitress on the shoulder . She turned, let out a scream o f delight, and threw her arms around him . The group of young me n watched this intently, glancing at one another with disapproval . I wondered if they thought Manifest Destiny included this Panaman- ian woman . The waitress led us to a corner . From somewhere, sh e produced a small table and two chairs . As we settled in, Fidel exchanged greetings in Spanish with tw o men at a table beside ours . Unlike the soldiers, they wore printe d short-sleeved shirts and creased slacks . The waitress returned wit h a couple of Balboa beers, and Fidel patted her on the rump as she turned to leave . She smiled and threw him a kiss . I glanced aroun d and was relieved to discover that the young men at the bar were n o longer watching us ; they were focused on the dancers . The majority of the patrons were English-speaking soldiers, bu t there were others, like the two beside us, who obviously were Pana- manians . They stood out because their hair would not have passe d inspection, and because they did not wear T-shirts and jeans . A fe w of them sat at tables, others leaned against the walls . They seemed t o be highly alert, like border collies guarding flocks of sheep . Women roamed the tables . They moved constantly, sitting on laps , shouting to the waitresses, dancing, swirling, singing, taking turn s on the stage . They wore tight skirts, T-shirts, jeans, clinging dresses , high heels . One was dressed in a Victorian gown and veil . Anothe r wore only a bikini . It was obvious that only the most beautiful coul d survive here . I marveled at the numbers who made their way to Pana - ma and wondered at the desperation that had driven them to this . \"All from other countries?\" I shouted to Fidel above the music . He nodded . \"Except . . .\" He pointed at the waitresses . \"They'r e Panamanian . \" \"What countries? \" \"Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Guatemala . \" \"Neighbors . \" \"Not entirely .

One morning during tha t same 1972 visit, I was sitting in an office I had been given at the In- stituto de Recursos Hidraulicos y Electrificacion, Panama's govern- ment-owned electric utility company . I was poring over a sheet o f statistics when a man knocked gently on the frame of my open door . I invited him in, pleased with any excuse to take my attention off th e numbers . He announced himself as the general's chauffeur and sai d he had come to take me to one of the general's bungalows . An hour later, I was sitting across the table from General Oma r Torrijos . He was dressed casually, in typical Panamanian style : khak i slacks and a short-sleeved shirt buttoned down the front, light blu e with a delicate green pattern . He was tall, fit, and handsome . H e seemed amazingly relaxed for a man with his responsibilities . A loc k of dark hair fell over his prominent forehead . He asked about my recent travels to Indonesia, Guatemala, an d Iran . The three countries fascinated him, but he seemed especiall y intrigued with Iran's king, Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi . The sha h had come to power in 1941, after the British and Soviets overthre w his father, whom they accused of collaborating with Hitler . l \"Can you imagine,\" Torrijos asked, \"being part of a plot to dethron e your own father? \" Panama's head of state knew a good deal about the history of thi s far-off land . We talked about how the tables were turned on the sha h 70 \t Part II : 1971—1975 \t 71"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"in 1951, and how his own premier, Mohammad Mossadegh, force d him into exile . Torrijos knew, as did most of the world, that it ha d been the CIA that labeled the premier a Communist and that steppe d in to restore the shah to power . However, he did not know—or a t least did not mention — the parts Claudine had shared with me , about Kermit Roosevelt's brilliant maneuvers and the fact that thi s had been the beginning of a new era in imperialism, the match tha t had ignited the global empire conflagration . \"After the shah was reinstated,\" Torrijos continued, \"he launche d a series of revolutionary programs aimed at developing the indus- trial sector and bringing Iran into the modern era . \" I asked him how he happened to know so much about Iran . \"I make it my point,\" he said . \"I don't think too highly of the shah' s politics — his willingness to overthrow his own father and become a CIA puppet —but it looks as though he's doing good things for hi s country . Perhaps I can learn something from him . If he survives . \" \"You think he won't? \" \"He has powerful enemies . \" \"And some of the world's best bodyguards . \" Torrijos gave me a sardonic look . \"His secret police, SAVAK, hav e the reputation of being ruthless thugs . That doesn't win many friends . He won't last much longer .\" He paused, then rolled his eyes . \"Body - guards? I have a few myself .\" He waved at the door . \"You think they'l l save my life if your country decides to get rid of me? \" I asked whether he truly saw that as a possibility . He raised his eyebrows in a manner that made me feel foolish fo r asking such a question . \"We have the Canal . That's a lot bigger tha n Arbenz and United Fruit . \" I had researched Guatemala, and I understood Torrijos's mean- ing . United Fruit Company had been that country's political equiva- lent of Panama's canal . Founded in the late 1800s, United Fruit soo n grew into one of the most powerful forces in Central America . Dur- ing the early 1950s, reform candidate Jacobo Arbenz was electe d president of Guatemala in an election hailed all over the hemispher e as a model of the democratic process . At the time, less than 3 percen t of Guatemalans owned 70 percent of the land . Arbenz promised t o help the poor dig their way out of starvation, and after his electio n he implemented a comprehensive land reform program . \"The poor and middle classes throughout Latin America ap - plauded Arbenz,\" Torrijos said . \"Personally, he was one of my heroes . But we also held our breath . We knew that United Fruit oppose d these measures, since they were one of the largest and most oppres- sive landholders in Guatemala . They also owned big plantations i n Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Jamaica, Nicaragua, Santo Domingo , and here in Panama . They couldn't afford to let Arbenz give the res t of us ideas . \" I knew the rest : United Fruit had launched a major public rela- tions campaign in the United States, aimed at convincing the Amer- ican public and congress that Arbenz was part of a Russian plot an d that Guatemala was a Soviet satellite . In 1954, the CIA orchestrate d a coup . American pilots bombed Guatemala City and the democrat- ically elected Arbenz was overthrown, replaced by Colonel Carlo s Castillo Armas, a ruthless right-wing dictator . The new government owed everything to United Fruit . By way o f thanks, the government reversed the land reform process, abolishe d taxes on the interest and dividends paid to foreign investors, elimi- nated the secret ballot, and jailed thousands of its critics . Anyone wh o dared to speak out against Castillo was persecuted . Historians trac e the violence and terrorism that plagued Guatemala for most of th e rest of the century to the not-so-secret alliance between United Fruit , the CIA, and the Guatemalan army under its colonel dictator . 2 \"Arbenz was assassinated,\" Torrijos continued . \"Political an d character assassination .\" He paused and frowned . \"How could you r people swallow that CIA rubbish? I won't go so easily The militar y here are my people . Political assassination won't do .\" He smiled . \"The CIA itself will have to kill me! \" We sat in silence for a few moments, each lost in his own thoughts . Torrijos was the first to speak . \"Do you know who owns United Fruit?\" he asked . \"Zapata Oil, George Bush's company—our UN ambassador .\" I said . \"A man with ambitions .\" He leaned forward and lowered hi s voice . \"And now I'm up against his cronies at Bechtel . \" This startled me . Bechtel was the world's most powerful engi- neering firm and a frequent collaborator on projects with MAIN . I n the case of Panama's master plan, I had assumed that they were on e of our major competitors . \"What do you mean? \" 72 \t Part II : 1971—1975 \t Conversations with the General 73"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"\"We've been considering building a new canal, a sea-level one , without locks .

I was on e of the people who perpetuated the system he so despised, and I wa s certain he knew it . My job of convincing him to accept internationa l loans in exchange for hiring U .S . engineering and construction firm s appeared to have hit a mammoth wall . I decided to confront hi m head-on . \"General,\" I asked, \"why did you invite me here? \" He glanced at his watch and smiled . \"Yes, time now to get dow n to our own business . Panama needs your help . I need your help . \" I was stunned . \"My help? What can I do for you? \" \"We will take back the Canal . But that's not enough .\" He relaxe d into his chair . \"We must also serve as a model . We must show tha t we care about our poor and we must demonstrate beyond any doub t that our determination to win our independence is not dictated b y Russia, China, or Cuba . We must prove to the world that Panama i s a reasonable country, that we stand not against the United State s but for the rights of the poor . \" He crossed one leg over the other . \"In order to do that we need t o build up an economic base that is like none in this hemisphere . Elec - tricity, yes — but electricity that reaches the poorest of our poor an d is subsidized . The same for transportation and communications . And especially for agriculture . Doing that will take money—you r money the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank . \" Once again, he leaned forward . His eyes held mine . \"I understan d that your company wants more work and usually gets it by inflatin g the size of projects—wider highways, bigger power plants, deeper harbors . This time is different, though . Give me wha t ' s best for m y people, and I ' ll give you all the work you want . \" What he proposed was totally unexpected, and it both shocke d and excited me . It certainly defied all I had learned at MAIN . Surely , he knew that the foreign aid game was a sham — he had to know . I t existed to make him rich and to shackle his country with debt . It wa s there so Panama would be forever obligated to the United States an d the corporatocracy . It was there to keep Latin America on the path o f Manifest Destiny and forever subservient to Washington and Wal l Street . I was certain that he knew that the system was based on th e assumption that all men in power are corruptible, and that his deci- sion not to use it for his personal benefit would be seen as a threat , a new form of domino that might start a chain reaction and eventu- ally topple the entire system . I looked across the coffee table at this man who certainly under - stood that because of the Canal he enjoyed a very special and uniqu e power, and that it placed him in a particularly precarious position . He had to be careful . He already had established himself as a leade r among LDC leaders . If he, like his hero Arbenz, was determined t o take a stand, the world would be watching . How would the syste m react? More specifically, how would the U .S . government react ? Latin American history was littered with dead heroes . I also knew I was looking at a man who challenged all the justifi - cations I had formulated for my own actions . This man certainly ha d his share of personal flaws, but he was no pirate, no Henry Morga n or Francis Drake — those swashbuckling adventurers who used let- ters of marque from English kings as a cloak to legitimatize piracy . The picture on the billboard had not been your typical political de- ception . \"Omar's ideal is freedom ; the missile is not invented tha t can kill an ideal!\" Hadn't Tom Paine penned something similar ? It made me wonder, though . Perhaps ideals do not die, but wha t about the men behind them? Che, Arbenz, Allende ; the latter wa s the only one still alive, but for how long? And it raised another ques - tion : how would I respond if Torrijos were thrust into the role o f martyr ? By the time I left him we both understood that MAIN would ge t the contract for the master plan, and that I would see to it that w e did Torrijos's bidding . 74 \t Part II : 1971—1975 \t Conversations with the General \t 75"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1 4 Entering a New and Sinister Perio d in Economic Histor y As chief economist, I not only was in charge of a department a t MAIN and responsible for the studies we carried out around th e globe, but I also was expected to be con v ersant with current eco- nomic trends and theories . The early 1970s were a time of majo r shifts in international economics . During the 1960s, a group of countries had formed OPEC, th e cartel of oil-producing nations, largely in response to the power o f the big refining companies . Iran was also a major factor . Even thoug h the shah owed his position and possibly his life to the United States ' clandestine intervention during the Mossadegh struggle—or per- haps because of that fact — the shah was acutely aware that th e tables could be turned on him at any time . The heads of state of othe r petroleum-rich nations shared this awareness and the paranoia tha t accompanied it . They also knew that the major international oi l companies, known as \"The Seven Sisters,\" were collaborating to hol d down petroleum prices — and thus the revenues they paid to the pro - ducing countries — as a means of reaping their own windfall profits . OPEC was organized in order to strike back . This all came to a head in the early 1970s, when OPEC brough t the industrial giants to their knees . A series of concerted actions , ending with a 1973 oil embargo symbolized by long lines at U .S . ga s stations, threatened to bring on an economic catastrophe rivalin g the Great Depression . It was a systemic shock to the developed world economy, and of a magnitude that few people could begi n to comprehend . The oil crisis could not have come at a worse time for the Unite d States . It was a confused nation, full of fear and self-doubt, reelin g from a humiliating war in Vietnam and a president who was abou t to resign . Nixon's problems were not limited to Southeast Asia an d Watergate . He had stepped up to the plate during an era that, in ret- rospect, would be understood as the threshold of a new epoch i n world politics and economics . In those days, it seemed that the `littl e guys, \" including the OPEC countries, were getting the upper hand . I was fascinated by world events . My bread was buttered by th e corporatocracy, yet some secret side of me enjoyed watching m y masters being put in their places . I suppose it assuaged my guilt a bit . I saw the shadow of Thomas Paine standing on the sidelines , cheering OPEC on . None of us could have been aware of the full impact of the em- bargo at the time it was happening . We certainly had our theories , but we could not understand what has since become clear . In hind - sight, we know that economic growth rates after the oil crisis wer e about half those prevailing in the 1950s and 1960s, and that the y have taken place against much greater inflationary pressure . Th e growth that did occur was structurally different and did not creat e nearly as many jobs, so unemployment soared . To top it all off, th e international monetary system took a blow ; the network of fixe d exchange rates, which had prevailed since the end of World War II , essentially collapsed . During that time, I frequently got together with friends to discus s these matters over lunch or over beers after work . Some of these peo - ple worked for me — my staff included very smart men and women , mostly young, who for the most part were freethinkers, at least b y conventional standards . Others were executives at Boston think tank s or professors at local colleges, and one was an assistant to a stat e congressman . These were informal meetings, sometimes attende d by as few as two of us, while others might include a dozen partici- pants . The sessions were always lively and raucous . When I look back at those discussions, I am embarrassed by th e sense of superiority I often felt . I knew things I could not share . M y friends sometimes flaunted their credentials — connections on Beaco n 76 \t Entering a New and Sinister Period in Economic History 77"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"Hill or in Washington, professorships and PhDs — and I would an- swer this in my role as chief economist of a major consulting firm , who traveled around the world first class . Yet, I could not discuss m y private meetings with men like Torrijos, or the things I knew abou t the ways we were manipulating countries on every continent . It wa s both a source of inner arrogance and a frustration . When we talked about the power of the little guys, I had to exer - cise a great deal of restraint . I knew what none of them could possibl y know, that the corporatocracy, its band of EHMs, and the jackal s waiting in the background would never allow the little guys to gai n control . I only had to draw upon the examples of Arbenz an d Mossadegh—and more recently, upon the 1973 CIA overthrow o f Chile's democratically elected president, Salvador Allende . In fact, I understood that the stranglehold of global empire was growin g stronger, despite OPEC — or, as I suspected at the time but did no t confirm until later, with OPEC's help . Our conversations often focused on the similarities between th e early 1970s and the 1930s . The latter represented a major watershe d in the international economy and in the way it was studied, analyzed , and perceived . That decade opened the door to Keynesian economic s and to the idea that government should play a major role in manag - ing markets and providing services such as health, unemploymen t compensation, and other forms of welfare . We were moving awa y from old assumptions that markets were self-regulating and that th e state's intervention should be minimal . The Depression resulted in the New Deal and in policies that pro - moted economic regulation, governmental financial manipulation , and the extensive application of fiscal policy . In addition, both th e Depression and World War II led to the creation of organization s like the World Bank, the IMF, and the General Agreement on Tariff s and Trade (GATT) . The 1960s was a pivotal decade in this perio d and in the shift from neoclassic to Keynesian economics . It happene d under the Kennedy and Johnson administrations, and perhaps th e most important single influence was one man, Robert McNamara . McNamara was a frequent visitor to our discussion groups — i n absentia, of course . We all knew about his meteoric rise to fame , from manager of planning and financial analysis at Ford Moto r Company in 1949 to Ford's president in 1960, the first company head selected from outside the Ford family . Shortly after that , Kennedy appointed him secretary of defense . McNamara became a strong advocate of a Keynesian approach t o government, using mathematical models and statistical approache s to determine troop levels, allocation of funds, and other strategies i n Vietnam . His advocacy of \"aggressive leadership\" became a hallmar k not only of government managers but also of corporate executives . I t formed the basis of a new philosophical approach to teaching man - agement at the nation's top business schools, and it ultimately led to a new breed of CEOs who would spearhead the rush to global empire . ' As we sat around the table discussing world events, we were es- pecially fascinated by McNamara's role as president of the Worl d Bank, a job he accepted soon after leaving his post as secretary of de - fense . Most of my friends focused on the fact that he symbolized wha t was popularly known as the military-industrial complex . He ha d held the top position in a major corporation, in a government cabinet , and now at the most powerful bank in the world . Such an apparen t breach in the separation of powers horrified many of them ; I ma y have been the only one among us who was not in the least surprised . I see now that Robert McNamara's greatest and most siniste r contribution to history was to jockey the World Bank into becomin g an agent of global empire on a scale never before witnessed . He als o set a precedent . His ability to bridge the gaps between the primar y components of the corporatocracy would be fine-tuned by his suc- cessors . For instance, George Shultz was secretary of the treasur y and chairman of the Council on Economic Policy under Nixon , served as Bechtel president, and then became secretary of state unde r Reagan . Caspar Weinberger was a Bechtel vice president and genera l council, and later the secretary of defense under Reagan . Richar d Helms was Johnson's CIA director and then became ambassador t o Iran under Nixon . Richard Cheney served as secretary of defens e under George H . W . Bush, as Halliburton president, and as U .S . vic e president to George W . Bush . Even a president of the United States , George H . W . Bush, began as founder of Zapata Petroleum Corp , served as U .S . ambassador to the U .N . under presidents Nixon an d Ford, and was Ford's CIA director . Looking back, I am struck by the innocence of those days . In man y respects, we were still caught up in the old approaches to empir e 78 Part II : 1971-1975 \t Entering a New and Sinister Period in Economic History 79"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"building . Kermit Roosevelt had shown us a better way when he over - threw an Iranian democrat and replaced him with a despotic king . We EHMs were accomplishing many of our objectives in places lik e Indonesia and Ecuador, and yet Vietnam was a stunning example o f how easily we could slip back into old patterns . It would take the leading member of OPEC, Saudi Arabia, t o change that . CHAPTER 1 5 The Saudi Arabia n Money-laundering Affai r In 1974, a diplomat from Saudi Arabia showed me photos of Riyadh , the capital of his country . Included in these photos was a herd o f goats rummaging among piles of refuse outside a government build- ing . When I asked the diplomat about them, his response shocke d me . He told me that they were the city's main garbage disposal system . \"No self-respecting Saudi would ever collect trash,\" he said . \"W e leave it to the beasts . \" Goats! In the capital of the world's greatest oil kingdom . It seeme d unbelievable . At the time, I was one of a group of consultants just beginning t o try to piece together a solution to the oil crisis . Those goats led me t o an understanding of how that solution might evolve, especially give n the country's pattern of development over the previous three centuries . Saudi Arabia's history is full of violence and religious fanaticism . In the eighteenth century, Mohammed ibn Saud, a local warlord , joined forces with fundamentalists from the ultraconservative Wah- habi sect . It was a powerful union, and during the next two hundre d years the Saud family and their Wahhabi allies conquered most o f the Arabian Peninsula, including Islam's holiest sites, Mecca an d Medina . Saudi society reflected the puritanical idealism of its founders , and a strict interpretation of Koranic beliefs was enforced . Religiou s police ensured adherence to the mandate to pray five times a day . 80 \t Part II : 1971—1975 \t 81"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"Women were required to cover themselves from head to toe . Pun- ishment for criminals was severe ; public executions and stoning s were common . During my first visit to Riyadh, I was amazed whe n my driver told me I could leave my camera, briefcase, and even m y wallet in plain sight inside our car, parked near the open market , without locking it . \"No one,\" he said, \"would think of stealing here . Thieves hav e their hands cut off . \" Later that day, he asked me if I would like to visit so-called Cho p Chop Square and watch a beheading . Wahhabism's adherence t o what we would consider extreme puritanism made the streets saf e from thieves — and demanded the harshest form of corporal pun- ishment for those who violated the laws . I declined the invitation . The Saudi view of religion as an important element of politic s and economics contributed to the oil embargo that shook the Wester n world . On October 6, 1973 (Yom Kippur, the holiest of Jewish holi - days), Egypt and Syria launched simultaneous attacks on Israel . It wa s the beginning of the October War — the fourth and most destructiv e of the Arab-Israeli wars, and the one that would have the greates t impact on the world . Egypt's President Sadat pressured Saudi Ara- bia's King Faisal to retaliate against the United States' complicity ' with Israel by employing what Sadat referred to as \"the oil weapon . \" On October 16, Iran and the five Arab Gulf states, including Saud i Arabia, announced a 70 percent increase in the posted price of oil . Meeting in Kuwait City, Arab oil ministers pondered further op - tions . The Iraqi representative was vehemently in favor of targetin g the United States . He called on the other delegates to nationaliz e American businesses in the Arab world, to impose a total oil embarg o on the United States and on all other nations friendly to Israel, an d to withdraw Arab funds from every American bank . He pointed ou t that Arab bank accounts were substantial and that this action coul d result in a panic not unlike that of 1929 . Other Arab ministers were reluctant to agree to such a radica l plan, but on October 17 they did decide to move forward with a mor e limited embargo, which would begin with a 5 percent cut in pro - duction and then impose an additional 5 percent reduction ever y month until their political objectives were met . They agreed that th e United States should be punished for its pro-Israeli stance an d should therefore have the most severe embargo levied against it . Several of the countries attending the meeting announced that the y would implement cutbacks of 10 percent, rather than 5 percent . On October 19, President Nixon asked Congress for $2 .2 billio n in aid to Israel . The next day, Saudi Arabia and other Arab produc- ers imposed a total embargo on oil shipments to the United States . . The oil embargo ended on March' 8, 1974 . Its duration was short , its impact immense . The selling price of Saudi oil leaped from $1 .3 9 a barrel on January 1, 1970, to $8 .32 on January 1, 1974 . 2 Politician s and future administrations would never forget the lessons learne d during the early- to mid-1970s . In the long run, the trauma of thos e few months served to strengthen the corporatocracy ; its three pillar s —big corporations, international banks, and government —bonde d as never before . That bond would endure . The embargo also resulted in significant attitude and polic y changes . It convinced Wall Street and Washington that such an em- bargo could never again be tolerated . Protecting our oil supplies ha d always been a priority ; after 1973, it became an obsession . The em- bargo elevated Saudi Arabia's status as a player in world politics an d forced Washington to recognize the kingdom's strategic importanc e to our own economy . Furthermore, it encouraged U .S . corporatoc- racy leaders to search desperately for methods to funnel petrodollar s back to America, and to ponder the fact that the Saudi governmen t lacked the administrative and institutional frameworks to properl y manage its mushrooming wealth . For Saudi Arabia, the additional oil income resulting from th e price hikes was a mixed blessing . It filled the national coffers wit h billions of dollars ; however, it also served to undermine some of th e strict religious beliefs of the Wahhabis . Wealthy Saudis travele d around the world . They attended schools and universities in Europ e and the United States . They bought fancy cars and furnished thei r houses with Western-style goods . Conservative religious beliefs wer e replaced by a new form of materialism — and it was this materialis m that presented a solution to fears of future oil crises . Almost immediately after the embargo ended, Washington bega n negotiating with the Saudis, offering them technical support, militar y hardware and training, and an opportunity to bring their nation int o the twentieth century, in exchange for petrodollars and, most impor - tantly, assurances that there would never again be another oil embargo . The negotiations resulted in the creation of a most extraordinar y 82 Part II : 1971-1975 \t The Saudi Arabian Money-laundering Affair 83"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"organization, the United States-Saudi Arabian Joint Economic Com - mission . Known as JECOR, it embodied an innovative concept tha t was the opposite of traditional foreign aid programs : it relied o n Saudi money to hire American firms to build up Saudi Arabia . Although overall management and fiscal responsibility wer e delegated to the U .S . Department of the Treasury, this commissio n was independent to the extreme . Ultimately, it would spend billion s of dollars over a period of more than twenty-five years, with virtuall y no congressional oversight . Because no U .S . funding was involved , Congress had no authority in the matter, despite Treasury's role . Afte r studying JECOR extensively, David Holden and Richard Johns con - clude, \"It was the most far-reaching agreement of its kind eve r concluded by the U .S . with a developing country . It had the potentia l to entrench the U .S . deeply in the Kingdom, fortifying the concept o f mutual interdependence .\" 3 The Department of the Treasury brought MAIN in at an earl y stage to serve as an adviser . I was summoned and told that my jo b would be critical, and that everything I did and learned should b e considered highly confidential . From my vantage point, it seeme d like a clandestine operation . At the time, I was led to believe tha t MAIN was the lead consultant in that process ; I subsequentl y came to realize that we were one of several consultants whose ex- pertise was sought . Since everything was done in the greatest secrecy, I was not priv y to Treasury's discussions with other consultants, and I therefor e cannot be certain about the importance of my role in this precedent - setting deal . I do know that the arrangement established new stan- dards for EHMs and that it launched innovative alternatives to th e traditional approaches for advancing the interests of empire . I als o know that most of the scenarios that evolved from my studies wer e ultimately implemented, that MAIN was rewarded with one of th e first major — and extremely profitable—contracts in Saudi Arabia , and that I received a large bonus that year . My job was to develop forecasts of what might happen in Saud i Arabia if vast amounts of money were invested in its infrastructure , and to map out scenarios for spending that money . In short, I wa s asked to apply as much creativity as I could to justifying the infusion o f hundreds of millions of dollars into the Saudi Arabian economy, un - der conditions that would include U .S . engineering and construction companies . I was told to do this on my own, not to rely on my staff , and I was sequestered in a small conference room several floor s above the one where my department was located . I was warned tha t my job was both a matter of national security and potentially very lu - crative for MAIN . I understood, of course, that the primary objective here was no t the usual —to burden this country with debts it could never repay — but rather to find ways that would assure that a large portion o f petrodollars found their way back to the United States . In the process , Saudi Arabia would be drawn in, its economy would become increas - ingly intertwined with and dependent upon ours, and presumably i t would grow more Westernized and therefore more sympathetic wit h and integrated into our system . Once I got started, I realized that the goats wandering the street s of Riyadh were the symbolic key ; they were a sore point amon g Saudis jet-setting around the world . Those goats begged to be replace d by something more appropriate for this desert kingdom that crave d entry into the modern world . I also knew that OPEC economist s were stressing the need for oil-rich countries to obtain more value - added products from their petroleum . Rather than simply exportin g crude oil, the economists were urging these countries to develop in - dustries of their own, to use this oil to produce petroleum-base d products they could sell to the rest of the world at a higher price tha n that brought by the crude itself . This twin realization opened the door to a strategy I felt certai n would be a win-win situation for everyone . The goats, of course, wer e merely an entry point . Oil revenues could be employed to hire U .S . companies to replace the goats with the world's most modern garbag e collection and disposal system, and the Saudis could take great prid e in this state-of-the-art technology . I came to think of the goats as one side of an equation that coul d be applied to most of the kingdom's economic sectors, a formula fo r success in the eyes of the royal family, the U .S . Department of th e Treasury, and my bosses at MAIN . Under this formula, money woul d be earmarked to create an industrial sector focused on transformin g raw petroleum into finished products for export . Large petrochem- ical complexes would rise from the desert, and around them, hug e industrial parks . Naturally, such a plan would also require the con- struction of thousands of megawatts of electrical generating capacity , 84 Part II : 1971-1975 \t The Saudi Arabian Money-laundering Affair 85"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"transmission and distribution lines, highways, pipelines, communi- cations networks, and transportation systems, including new airports , improved seaports, a vast array of service industries, and the infra - structure essential to keep all these cogs turning . We all had high expectations that this plan would evolve int o a model of how things should be done in the rest of the world . Globe-trotting Saudis would sing our praises ; they would in v it e leaders from many countries to come to Saudi Arabia and witnes s the miracles we had accomplished ; those leaders would then call o n us to help them devise similar plans for their countries and—i n most cases, for countries outside the ring of OPEC — would arrang e World Bank or other debt-ridden methods for financing them . Th e global empire would be well served . As I worked through these ideas, I thought of the goats, and th e words of my driver often echoed in my ears : \"No self-respectin g Saudi would ever collect trash .\" I had heard that refrain repeatedly , in many different contexts . It was obvious that the Saudis had n o intention of putting their own people to work at menial tasks , whether as laborers in industrial facilities or in the actual construc- tion of any of the projects . In the first place, there were too few o f them . In addition, the royal House of Saud had indicated a commit - ment to providing its citizens with a level of education and a lifestyle that were inconsistent with those of manual laborers . Th e Saudis might manage others, but they had no desire or motivation t o become factory and construction workers . Therefore, it would b e necessary to import a labor force from other countries — countrie s where labor was cheap and where people needed work . If possible , the labor should come from other Middle Eastern or Islamic coun- tries, such as Egypt, Palestine, Pakistan, and Yemen . This prospect created an even greater new stratagem for devel- opment opportunities . Mammoth housing complexes would have t o be constructed for these laborers, as would shopping malls, hospitals , fire and police department facilities, water and sewage treatmen t plants, electrical, communications, and transportation networks — in fact, the end result would be to create modern cities where onc e only deserts had existed . Here, too, was the opportunity to explor e emerging technologies in, for example, desalinization plants, micro - wave systems, health care complexes, and computer technologies . Saudi Arabia was a planner's dream come true, and also a fantasy realized for anyone associated with the engineering and construc- tion business . It presented an economic opportunity unrivaled b y any other in history : an underdeveloped country with virtually un - limited financial resources and a desire to enter the modern age in a big way very quickly . I must admit that I enjoyed this job immensely . There was n o solid data available in Saudi Arabia, in the Boston Public Library, o r anywhere else that justified the use of econometric models in thi s context . In fact, the magnitude of the job — the total and immediat e transformation of an entire nation on a scale never before witnesse d — meant that even had historical data existed, it would have bee n irrelevant . Nor was anyone expecting this type of quantitative analysis, a t least not at this stage of the game . I simply put my imagination t o work and wrote reports that envisioned a glorious future for th e kingdom . I had rule-of-thumb numbers I could use to estimate suc h things as the approximate cost to produce a megawatt of electricity , a mile of road, or adequate water, sewage, housing, food, and publi c services for one laborer . I was not supposed to refine these estimates o r to draw final conclusions . My job was simply to describe a series o f plans (more accurately, perhaps, \"visions\") of what might be possible , and to arrive at rough estimates of the costs associated with them . I always kept in mind the true objectives : maximizing payouts t o U .S . firms and making Saudi Arabia increasingly dependent on th e United States . It did not take long to realize how closely the tw o went together ; almost all the newly developed projects would requir e continual upgrading and servicing, and they were so highly technica l as to assure that the companies that originally developed them woul d have to maintain and modernize them . In fact, as I moved forwar d with my work, I began to assemble two lists for each of the project s I envisioned : one for the types of design-and-construction contract s we could expect, and another for long-term service and managemen t agreements . MAIN, Bechtel, Brown & Root, Halliburton, Stone & Webster, and many other U .S . engineers and contractors woul d profit handsomely for decades to come . Beyond the purely economic, there was another twist that woul d render Saudi Arabia dependent on us, though in a very different way . The modernization of this oil-rich kingdom would trigger advers e reactions . For instance, conservative Muslims would be furious ; Israe l 86 Part II : 1971–1975 \t The Saudi Arabian Money-laundering Affair 87"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"and other neighboring countries would feel threatened . The eco- nomic development of this nation was likely to spawn the growth o f another industry : protecting the Arabian Peninsula . Private compa- nies specializing in such activities, as well as the U .S . military an d defense industry, could expect generous contracts — and, once again , long-term service and management agreements . Their presenc e would require another phase of engineering and construction proj- ects, including airports, missile sites, personnel bases, and all of th e infrastructure associated with such facilities . I sent my reports in sealed envelopes through interoffice mail, ad - dressed to \"Treasury Department Project Manager .\" I occasionall y met with a couple of other members of our team — vice presidents a t MAIN and my superiors . Sincawe had no official name for this proj - ect, which was still in the research and development phase and wa s not yet part of JECOR, we referred to it only—and with hushe d voices — as SAMA . Ostensibly, this stood for Saudi Arabian Money - laundering Affair, but it was also a tongue-in-cheek play on words ; the kingdom's central bank was called the Saudi Arabian Monetar y Agency, or SAMA . Sometimes a Treasury representative would join us . I asked fe w questions during these meetings . Mainly, I just described my work , responded to their comments, and agreed to try to do whatever wa s asked of me . The vice presidents and Treasury representatives wer e especially impressed with my ideas about the long-term service an d management agreements . It prodded one of the vice presidents t o coin a phrase we often used after that, referring to the kingdom a s \"the cow we can milk until the sun sets on our retirement .\" For me , that phrase always conjured images of goats rather than cows . It was during those meetings that I came to realize that several o f our competitors were involved in similar tasks, and that in the en d we all expected to be awarded lucrative contracts as a result of ou r efforts . I assumed that MAIN and the other firms were footing th e bill for this preliminary work, taking a short-term risk in order t o throw our hats into the ring . This assumption was reinforced by th e fact that the number I charged my time to on our daily personal tim e sheets appeared to be a general and administrative overhead ac - count . Such an approach was typical of the research and develop- ment/proposal preparation phase of most projects . In this case, the initial investment certainly far exceeded the norm, but those vic e presidents seemed extremely confident about the payback . Despite the knowledge that our competitors were also involved , we all assumed that there was enough work to go around . I also ha d been in the business long enough to believe that the rewards be - stowed would reflect the level of Treasury's acceptance of the wor k we had done, and that those consultants who came up with the ap- proaches that were finally implemented would receive the choices t contracts . I took it as a personal challenge to create scenarios tha t would make it to the design-and-construct stage . My star was al - ready rising rapidly at MAIN . Being a key player in SAMA woul d guarantee its acceleration, if we were successful . During our meetings, we also openly discussed the likelihood tha t SAMA and the entire JECOR operation would set new precedents . It represented an innovative approach to creating lucrative work i n countries that did not need to incur debts through the internationa l banks . Iran and Iraq came immediately to mind as two additiona l examples of such countries . Moreover, given human nature, we fel t that the leaders of such countries would likely be motivated to tr y to emulate Saudi Arabia . There seemed little doubt that the 197 3 oil embargo —which had initially appeared to be so negative — would end up offering many unexpected gifts to the engineering an d construction business, and would help to further pave the road t o global empire . I worked on that visionary phase for about eight months — althoug h never for more than several intense days at a time — sequestered i n my private conference room or in my apartment overlooking Bosto n Common . My staff all had other assignments and pretty much too k care of themselves, although I checked in on them periodically . Ove r time, the secrecy around our work declined . More people becam e aware that something big involving Saudi Arabia was going on . Ex - citement swelled, rumors swirled . The vice presidents and Treasur y representatives grew more open—in part, I believe, because the y themselves became privy to more information as details about th e ingenious scheme emerged . Under this evolving plan, Washington wanted the Saudis t o guarantee to maintain oil supplies and prices at levels that coul d fluctuate but that would always remain acceptable to the Unite d 88 Part II : 1971—1975 \t The Saudi Arabian Money-laundering Affair 89"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"States and our allies . If other countries such as Iran, Iraq, Indonesia , or Venezuela threatened embargoes, Saudi Arabia, with its vast pe- troleum supplies, would step in to fill the gap ; simply the knowledg e that they might do so would, in the long run, discourage other coun- tries from even considering an embargo . In exchange for this guar- antee, Washington would offer the House of Saud an amazingl y attractive deal : a commitment to provide total and unequivocal U .S . political and—if necessary — military support, thereby ensurin g their continued existence as the rulers of their country . It was a deal the House of Saud could hardly refuse, given its ge- ographic location, lack of military might, and general vulnerabilit y to neighbors like Iran, Syria, Iraq, and Israel . Naturally, therefore , Washington used its advantage to impose one other critical condi- tion, a condition that redefined the role of EHMs in the world an d served as a model we would later attempt to apply in other countries , most notably in Iraq . In retrospect, I sometimes find it difficult t o understand how Saudi Arabia could have accepted this condition . Certainly, most of the rest of the Arab world, OPEC, and other Is- lamic countries were appalled when they discovered the terms of th e deal and the manner in which the royal house capitulated to Wash- ington's demands . The condition was that Saudi Arabia would use its petrodollars t o purchase U .S . government securities ; in turn, the interest earned b y these securities would be spent by the U .S . Department of the Trea- sury in ways that enabled Saudi Arabia to emerge from a medieva l society into the modern, industrialized world . In other words, th e interest compounding on billions of dollars of the kingdom's oil in - come would be used to pay U .S . companies to fulfill the vision I (an d presumably some of my competitors) had come up with, to conver t Saudi Arabia into a modern industrial power . Our own U .S . De- partment of the Treasury would hire us, at Saudi expense, to buil d infrastructure projects and even entire cities throughout the Arabia n Peninsula . Although the Saudis reserved the right to provide input regardin g the general nature of these projects, the reality was that an elit e corps of foreigners (mostly infidels, in the eyes of Muslims) woul d determine the future appearance and economic makeup of the Ara- bian Peninsula . And this would occur in a kingdom founded on con- servative Wahhabi principles and run according to those principles for several centuries . It seemed a huge leap of faith on their part, ye t under the circumstances, and due to the political and military pres- sures undoubtedly brought to bear by Washington, I suspected th e Saud family felt they had few alternatives . From our perspective, the prospects for immense profits seeme d limitless . It was a sweetheart deal with potential to set an amazin g precedent . And to make the deal even sweeter, no one had to obtai n congressional approval — a process loathed by corporations, particu- larly privately owned ones like Bechtel and MAIN, which prefer no t to open their books or share their secrets with anyone . Thomas W . Lippman, an adjunct scholar at the Middle East Institute and a for - mer journalist, eloquently summarizes the salient points of this deal : The Saudis, rolling in cash, would deliver hundreds o f millions of dollars to Treasury, which held on to the fund s until they were needed to pay vendors or employees . Thi s system assured that the Saudi money would be recycle d back into the American economy . . . It also ensured tha t the commission's managers could undertake whateve r projects they and the Saudis agreed were useful withou t having to justify them to Congress . 4 Establishing the parameters for this historic undertaking too k less time than anyone could have imagined . After that, however, w e had to figure out a way to implement it . To set the process in motion , someone at the highest level of government was dispatched to Saud i Arabia — an extremely confidential mission . I never knew for sure , but I believe the envoy was Henry Kissinger . Whoever the envoy was, his first job was to remind the royal famil y about what had happened in neighboring Iran when Mossadeg h tried to oust British petroleum interests . Next, he would outline a plan that would be too attractive for them to turn down, in effec t con v eying to the Saudis that they had few alternatives . I have n o doubt that they were left with the distinct impression that they coul d either accept our offer and thus gain assurances that we would sup - port and protect them as rulers, or they could refuse—and go th e way of Mossadegh . When the envoy returned to Washington, h e brought with him the message that the Saudis would like to comply . There was just one slight obstacle . We would have to convince ke y 90 Part II : 1971—1975 \t The Saudi Arabian Money-laundering Affair 91"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"players in the Saudi government . This, we were informed, was a family matter . Saudi Arabia was not a democracy, and yet it seeme d that within the House of Saud there was a need for consensus . In 1975, I was assigned to one of those key players . I alway s thought of him as Prince W ., although I never determined that h e was actually a crown prince . My job was to persuade him that th e Saudi Arabia Money-laundering Affair would benefit his country a s well as him personally . This was not as easy as it appeared at first . Prince W . professe d himself a good Wahhabi and insisted that he did not want to see hi s country follow in the footsteps of Western commercialism . He als o claimed that he understood the insidious nature of what we wer e proposing . We had, he said, the same objectives as the crusaders a millennium earlier : the Christianization of the Arab world . In fact , he was partially right about this . In my opinion, the difference be- tween the crusaders and us was a matter of degree . Europe's medieva l Catholics claimed their goal was to save Muslims from purgatory ; we claimed that we wanted to help the Saudis modernize . In truth , I believe the crusaders, like the corporatocracy, were primaril y seeking to expand their empire . Religious beliefs aside, Prince W . had one weakness — for beautifu l blonds . It seems almost ludicrous to mention what has now becom e an unfair stereotype, and I should mention that Prince W . was th e only man among many Saudis I have known who had this proclivity , or at least the only one who was willing to let me see it . Yet, it playe d a role in structuring this historic deal, and it demonstrates how fa r I would go to complete my mission . CHAPTER 1 6 Pimping, and Financin g Osama bin Lade n From the start, Prince W . let me know that whenever he came t o visit me in Boston he expected to be entertained by a woman of hi s liking, and that he expected her to perform more functions than thos e of a simple escort . But he most definitely did not want a professiona l call girl, someone he or his family members might bump into on th e street or at a cocktail party My meetings with Prince W . were held i n secret, which made it easier for me to comply with his wishes . \"Sally\" was a beautiful blue-eyed blond woman who lived in th e Boston area . Her husband, a United Airlines pilot who traveled a grea t deal both on and off the job, made little attempt to hide his infideli- ties . Sally had a cavalier attitude about her husband's activities . Sh e appreciated his salary, the plush Boston condo, and the benefits a pilot's spouse enjoyed in those days . A decade earlier, she had bee n a hippie who had become accustomed to promiscuous sex, and sh e found the idea of a secret source of income attractive . She agreed t o give Prince W . a try, on one condition : she insisted that the future o f their relationship depended entirely upon his behavior and attitud e toward her . Fortunately for me, each met the other's criteria . The Prince W .-Sally Affair, a subchapter of the Saudi Arabi a Money-laundering Affair, created its own set of problems for me . MAIN strictly prohibited its partners from doing anything illicit . From a legal standpoint, I was procuring sex — pimping — an illega l activity in Massachusetts, and so the main problem was figuring ou t 92 \t Part II : 1971—1975 \t 93"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"how to pay for Sall y 's services . Luckily, the accounting departmen t allowed me great liberties with my expense account . I was a goo d tipper, and I managed to persuade waiters in some of the most pos h restaurants in Boston to provide me with blank receipts ; it was a n era when people, not computers, filled out receipts . Prince W . grew bolder as time went by . Eventually, he wanted m e to arrange for Sally to come and live in his private cottage in Saud i Arabia . This was not an unheard-of request in those days ; there wa s an active trade in young women between certain European countrie s and the Middle East . These women were given contracts for som e specified period of time, and when the contract expired they wen t home to very substantial bank accounts . Robert Baer, a case office r in the CIA's directorate of operations for twenty years, and a spe- cialist in the Middle East, sums it up : \"In the early 1970s, when th e petrodollars started flooding in, enterprising Lebanese began smug - gling hookers into the kingdom for the princes . . . Since no one in th e royal family knows how to balance a checkbook, the Lebanese be - came fabulously wealthy .\" l I was familiar with this situation and even knew people wh o could arrange such contracts . However, for me, there were two majo r obstacles : Sally and the payment . I was certain Sally was not abou t to leave Boston and move to a desert mansion in the Middle East . I t was also pretty obvious that no collection of blank restaurant re- ceipts would cover this expense . Prince W . took care of the latter concern by assuring me that h e expected to pay for his new mistress himself ; I was only required t o make the arrangements . It also gave me great relief when he went o n to confide that the Saudi Arabian Sally did not have to be the exac t same person as the one who had kept him company in the Unite d States . I made calls to several friends who had Lebanese contacts i n London and Amsterdam . Within a couple of weeks, a surrogate Sall y signed a contract . Prince W . was a complex person . Sally satisfied a corporeal desire , and my ability to help the prince in this regard earned me his trust . However, it by no means convinced him that SAMA was a strateg y he wanted to recommend for his country . I had to work very hard t o win my case . I spent many hours showing him statistics and helpin g him analyze studies we had undertaken for other countries, includin g the econometric models I had developed for Kuwait while training with Claudine, during those first few months before heading to In- donesia . Eventually he relented . I am not familiar with the details of what went on between m y fellow EHMs and the other key Saudi players . All I know is that th e entire package was finally approved by the royal family . MAIN wa s rewarded for its part with one of the first highly lucrative contracts , administered by the U .S . Department of the Treasury . We were com - missioned to make a complete survey of the country's disorganize d and outmoded electrical system and to design a new one that woul d meet standards equivalent to those in the United States . As usual, it was my job to send in the first team, to develop eco - nomic and electric load forecasts for each region of the country . Three of the men who worked for me — all experienced in interna- tional projects — were preparing to leave for Riyadh when word cam e down from our legal department that under the terms of the con - tract we were obligated to have a fully equipped office up an d running in Riyadh within the next few weeks . This clause had ap- parently gone unnoticed for over a month . Our agreement wit h Treasury further stipulated that all equipment had to be manufac- tured either in the United States or in Saudi Arabia . Since Saud i Arabia did not have factories for producing such items, everythin g had to be sent from the States . To our chagrin, we discovered tha t long lines of tankers were queued up, waiting to get into ports on th e Arabian Peninsula . It could take many months to get a shipment o f supplies into the kingdom . MAIN was not about to lose such a valuable contract over a coupl e of rooms of office furniture . At a conference of all the partners in - volved, we brainstormed for several hours . The solution we settle d on was to charter a Boeing 747, fill it with supplies from Boston-are a stores, and send it off to Saudi Arabia . I remember thinking that i t would be fitting if the plane were owned by United Airlines an d commanded by a certain pilot whose wife had played such a critica l role in bringing the House of Saud around .

A s Thomas Lippman observed in 2003 : Americans have reshaped a vast, bleak landscape o f nomads' tents and farmers' mud huts in their own image , right down to Starbucks on the corner and the wheelchair - accessible ramps in the newest public buildings . Saud i Arabia today is a country of expressways, computers , air-conditioned malls filled with the same glossy shop s found in prosperous American suburbs, elegant hotels , fast-food restaurants, satellite television, up-to-dat e hospitals, high-rise office towers, and amusement park s featuring whirling rides . 3 The plans we conceived in 1974 set a standard for future negoti- ations with oil-rich countries . In a way, SAMA/JECOR was the nex t plateau after the one Kermit Roosevelt had established in Iran . I t introduced an innovative level of sophistication to the arsenal o f political-economic weapons used by a new breed of soldiers fo r global empire . The Saudi Arabia Money-laundering Affair and the Joint Com - mission also set new precedents for international jurisprudence . Thi s was very evident in the case of Idi Amin . When the notorious Ugan- dan dictator went into exile in 1979, he was given asylum in Saud i Arabia . Although he was considered a murderous despot responsibl e for the deaths of between one hundred thousand and three hundre d thousand people, he retired to a life of luxury, complete with car s and domestic servants provided by the House of Saud . The Unite d States quietly objected but refused to press the issue for fear of un- dermining its arrangement with the Saudis . Amin whiled away hi s last years fishing and taking strolls on the beach . In 2003, he died i n Jiddah, succumbing to kidney failure at the age of eighty . 4 More subtle and ultimately much more damaging was the rol e Saudi Arabia was allowed to play in financing international terror - ism . The United States made no secret of its desire to have the Hous e of Saud bankroll Osama bin Laden's Afghan war against the Soviet Union during the 198os, and Riyadh and Washington together con- tributed an estimated 53 .5 billion to the mujahideen . 5 However , U .S . and Saudi participation went far beyond this . In late 2003, US . News € ' World Report conducted an exhaustiv e study titled, \"The Saudi Connection .\" The magazine reviewed thou - sands of pages of court records, U .S . and foreign intelligence reports , and other documents, and interviewed dozens of government offi- cials and experts on terrorism and the Middle East . Its finding s include the following : The evidence was indisputable : Saudi Arabia, America' s longtime ally and the world's largest oil producer, ha d somehow become, as a senior Treasury Departmen t official put it, \"the epicenter\" of terrorist financing . . . Starting in the late 1980s — after the dual shocks o f the Iranian revolution and the Soviet war in Afghanista n — Saudi Arabia's quasi-official charities became the pri- mary source of funds for the fast-growing jihad movement . In some 20 countries the money was used to run para - military training camps, purchase weapons, and recrui t new members . . . Saudi largess encouraged U .S . officials to look th e other way, some veteran intelligence officers say . Billion s of dollars in contracts, grants, and salaries have gone to a broad range of former U .S . officials who had dealt wit h the Saudis : ambassadors, CIA station chiefs, even cabine t secretaries . . . Electronic intercepts of conversations implicate d members of the royal family in backing not onl y Al Qaeda but also other terrorist groups . 6 After the 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Penta- gon, more evidence emerged about the covert relationships betwee n Washington and Riyadh . In October 2003, Vanity Fair magazin e disclosed information that had not previously been made public, i n an in-depth report titled, \"Saving the Saudis .\" The story that emerge d about the relationship between the Bush family, the House of Saud , and the bin Laden family did not surprise me .

CHAPTER 1 7 Panama Canal Negotiation s and Graham Green e Saudi Arabia made many careers . Mine was already well on the way , but my successes in the desert kingdom certainly opened ne w doors for me . By 1977, I had built a small empire that included a staf f of around twenty professionals headquartered in our Boston office , and a stable of consultants from MAIN'S other departments and of - fices scattered across the globe . I had become the youngest partne r in the firm's hundred-year history . In addition to my title of Chie f Economist, I was named manager of Economics and Regional Plan - ning . I was lecturing at Harvard and other venues, and newspaper s were soliciting articles from me about current events .' I owned a sailing yacht that was docked in Boston Harbor next to the histori c battleship Constitution, \"Old Ironsides,\" renowned for subduing th e Barbary pirates not long after the Revolutionary War . I was bein g paid an excellent salary and I had equity that promised to elevate m e to the rarified heights of millionaire well before I turned forty . True , my marriage had fallen apart, but I was spending time with beauti- ful and fascinating women on several continents . Bruno came up with an idea for an innovative approach to fore - casting : an econometric model based on the writings of a turn-of- the-century Russian mathematician . The model involved assignin g subjective probabilities to predictions that certain specific sectors o f an economy would grow . It seemed an ideal tool to justify' the in- flated rates of increase we liked to show in order to obtain larg e loans, and Bruno asked me to see what I could do with the concept . ioi"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"I brought a young MIT mathematician, Dr . Nadipuram Prasad , into my department and gave him a budget . Within six months h e developed the Markov method for econometric modeling . Togethe r we hammered out a series of technical papers that presente d Markov as a revolutionary method for forecasting the impact of in- frastructure investment on economic development . It was exactly what we wanted : a tool that scientifically \"proved \" we were doing countries a favor by helping them incur debts the y would never be able to pay off . In addition, only a highly skilled econo - metrician with lots of time and money could possibly comprehen d the intricacies of Markov or question its conclusions . The papers wer e published by several prestigious organizations, and we formally pre - sented them at conferences and universities in a number of countries . The papers — and we — became famous throughout the industry . 2 Omar Torrijos and I honored our secret agreement . I made sur e our studies were honest and that our recommendations took into ac - count the poor . Although I heard grumbling that my forecasts i n Panama were not up to their usual inflated standards, and even tha t they smacked of socialism, the fact was that MAIN kept winnin g contracts from the Torrijos government . These contracts included a first —to provide innovative master plans that involved agricultur e along with the more traditional infrastructure sectors . I also watche d from the sidelines as Torrijos and Jimmy Carter set out to renegoti - ate the Canal Treaty . The Canal negotiations generated great interest and great pas- sions around the world . People everywhere waited to see whethe r the United States would do what most of the rest of the world be- lieved was the right thing — allow the Panamanians to take contro l — or would instead try to reestablish our global version of Manifes t Destiny, which had been shaken by our Vietnam debacle . For many , it appeared that a reasonable and compassionate man had bee n elected to the U .S . presidency at just the right time . However, th e conservative bastions of Washington and the pulpits of the religiou s right rang with indignation . How could we give up this bulwark o f national defense, this symbol of U .S . ingenuity, this ribbon of wate r that tied South America's fortunes to the whims of U .S . commercia l interests ? During my trips to Panama, I became accustomed to staying at the Hotel Continental . However, on my fifth visit I moved across th e street to the Hotel Panama because the Continental was undergoin g renovations and the construction was very noisy . At first, I resente d the inconvenience — the Continental had been my home away fro m home . But now the expansive lobby where I sat, with its rattan chair s and paddle-bladed wooden ceiling fans, was growing on me . It coul d have been the set of Casablanca, and I fantasized that Humphre y Bogart might stroll in at any moment . I set down the copy of th e New York Review of Books, in which I had just finished reading a Graham Greene article about Panama, and stared up at those fans , recalling an evening almost two years earlier . \"Ford is a weak president who won't be reelected,\" Omar Torrijo s predicted in 1975 . He was speaking to a group of influential Pana- manians . I was one of the few foreigners who had been invited to th e elegant old club with its whirring ceiling fans . \"That's the reason I decided to accelerate this Canal issue . It's a good time to launch a n all-out political battle to win it back . \" The speech inspired me . I returned to my hotel room and scratche d out a letter that I eventually mailed to the Boston Globe . Back i n Boston, an editor responded by calling me at my office to reques t that I write an Op-Ed piece . \"Colonialism in Panama Has No Plac e in 197 5 \" took up nearly half the page opposite the editorials in th e September 19, 1975, edition . The article cited three specific reasons for transferring the Cana l to Panama . First, \"the present situation is unjust — a good reason fo r any decision .\" Second, \"the existing treaty creates far graver securit y risks than would result from turning more control over to the Pana - manians .\" I referenced a study conducted by the Interoceanic Cana l Commission, which concluded that \"traffic could be halted for tw o years by a bomb planted—conceivably by one man—in the sid e of Gatun Dam,\" a point General Torrijos himself had publicly em- phasized . And third, \"the present situation is creating serious prob - lems for already-troubled United States-Latin American relations . \" I ended with the fol l owing : The best way of assuring the continued and efficient op - eration of the Canal is to help Panamanians gain contro l over and responsibility for it . In so doing, we could tak e 102 Part III : 1975—1981 \t Panama Canal Negotiations and Graham Greene 103"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"pride in initiating an action that would reaffirm commit- ments to the cause of self-determination to which w e pledged ourselves 200 years ago . . . Colonialism was in vogue at the turn of the centur y (early 19005) as it had been in 1775 . Perhaps ratificatio n of such a treaty can be understood in the context of thos e times . Today it is without justification . Colonialism ha s no place in 1975 . We, celebrating our bicentennial , should realize this, and act accordingly . 3 Writing that piece was a bold move on my part, especially since I had recently been made a partner at MAIN . Partners were expecte d to avoid the press and certainly to refrain from publishing politica l diatribes on the editorial pages of New England's most prestigiou s newspaper . I received through interoffice mail a pile of nasty, mostl y anonymous notes stapled to copies of the article . I was certain tha t I recognized the handwriting on one as that of Charlie Illingworth . My first project manager had been at MAIN for over ten years (com - pared to less than five for me) and was not yet a partner . A fierc e skull and crossbones figured prominently on the note, and its mes- sage was simple : \"Is this Commie really a partner in our firm? \" Bruno summoned me to his office and said, \"You'll get loads o f grief over th i s MAIN'S a pretty conservative place . But I want you t o know I think you're smart . Torrijos will love it ; I do hope you'r e sending him a copy . Good . Well, these jokers here in this office, th e ones who think Torrijos is a Socialist, really won't give a damn a s long as the work flows in . \" Bruno had been right — as usual . Now it was 1977, Carter was i n the White House, and serious Canal negotiations were under way . Many of MAIN's competitors had taken the wrong side and ha d been turned out of Panama, but our work had multiplied . And I wa s sitting in the lobby of the Hotel Panama, having just finished read- ing an article by Graham Greene in the New York Review of Books . The article, \"The Country with Five Frontiers,\" was a gutsy piec e that included a discussion of corruption among senior officers i n Panama's National Guard . The author pointed out that the genera l himself admitted to giving many of his staff special privileges, suc h as superior housing, because \"If I don't pay them, the CIA will .\" Th e clear implication was that the U .S . intelligence community was determined to undermine the wishes of President Carter and, if nec- essary, would bribe Panama ' s military chiefs into sabotaging th e treaty negotiations . 4 I could not help but wonder if the jackals ha d begun to circle Torrijos . I had seen a photograph in the \"People\" section of TIME o r Newsweek of Torrijos and Greene sitting together ; the caption indi- cated that the writer was a special guest who had become a goo d friend . I wondered how the general felt about this novelist, whom h e apparently trusted, writing such a critique . Graham Greene's article raised another question, one that relate d to that day in 1972 when I had sat across a coffee table from Torrijos . At the time, I had assumed that Torrijos knew the foreign aid gam e was there to make him rich while shackling his country with debt . I had been sure he knew that the process was based on the assump- tion that men in power are corruptible, and that his decision not t o seek personal benefit — but rather to use foreign aid to truly help hi s people — would be seen as a threat that might eventually topple th e entire system . The world was watching this man ; his actions ha d ramifications that reached far beyond Panama and would therefor e not be taken lightly . I had wondered how the corporatocracy would react if loan s made to Panama helped the poor without contributing to impossibl e debts . Now I wondered whether Torrijos regretted the deal he and I had struck that day— and I wasn't quite sure how I felt about thos e deals myself . I had stepped back from my EHM role . I had playe d his game instead of mine, accepting his insistence on honesty in ex - change for more contracts . In purely economic terms, it had been a wise business decision for MAIN . Nonetheless, it had been incon- sistent with what Claudine had instilled in me ; it was not advancin g the global empire . Had it now unleashed the jackals ? I recalled thinking, when I left Torrijos's bungalow that day, tha t Latin American history is littered with dead heroes . A system base d on corrupting public figures does not take kindly to public figure s who refuse to be corrupted . Then I thought my eyes were playing tricks . A familiar figure wa s walking slowly across the lobby . At first, I was so confused that I be - lieved it was Humphrey Bogart, but Bogart was long deceased .

Graham Greene hesitated a moment , peered around, and headed for the coffee shop . I was tempted to call out or to run after him, but I stopped my - self : An inner voice said he needed his privacy ; another warned tha t he would shun me . I picked up the New York Review of Books an d was surprised a moment later to discover that I was standing in th e doorway to the coffee shop . I had breakfasted earlier that morning, and the maitre d' gave m e an odd look . I glanced around . Graham Greene sat alone at a tabl e near the wall . I pointed to the table beside him . \"Over there,\" I told the maitre d' . \"Can I sit there for anothe r breakfast? \" I was always a good tipper ; the maitre d' smiled knowingly an d led me to the table . The novelist was absorbed in his newspaper . I ordered coffee an d a croissant with honey . I wanted to discover Greene's thoughts abou t Panama, Torrijos, and the Canal affair, but had no idea how to initi - ate such a conversation . Then he looked up to take a sip fro m his glass . \"Excuse me,\" I said . He glared at me — or so it seemed . \"Yes? \" \"I hate to intrude . But you are Graham Greene, aren't you? \" \"Why, yes indeed .\" He smiled warmly . \"Most people in Panam a don't recognize me . \" I gushed that he was my favorite novelist, and then gave him a brief life history, including my work at MAIN and my meetings wit h Torrijos . He asked if I was the consultant who had written an articl e about the United States getting out of Panama . \"In the Boston Globe , if I recall correctly . \" I was flabbergasted . \"A courageous thing to do, given your position,\" he said . \"Won' t you join me? \" I moved to his table and sat there with him for what must hav e been an hour and a half . I realized as we chatted how very close t o Torrijos he had grown . He spoke of the general at times like a fathe r speaking about his son . \"The general,\" he said, \"invited me to write a book about his coun - try . I ' m doing just that . This one will be nonfiction -- something a bi t off the line for me . \" I asked him why he usually wrote novels instead of nonfiction . \"Fiction is safer,\" he said . \"Most of my subject matter is contro - versial . Vietnam . Haiti . The Mexican Revolution . A lot of publisher s would be afraid to publish nonfiction about these matters .\" H e pointed at the New York Review of Books, where it lay on the table I had vacated . \"Words like those can cause a great deal of damage . \" Then he smiled . \"Besides, I like to write fiction . It gives me muc h greater freedom .\" He looked at me intensely . \"The important thin g is to write about things that matter . Like your Globe article abou t the Canal . \" His admiration for Torrijos was obvious . It seemed that Panama' s head of state could impress a novelist every bit as much as he im- pressed the poor and dispossessed . Equally obvious was Greene' s concern for his friend's life . `\"It's a huge endeavor,\" he exclaimed, \"taking on the Giant of th e North .\" He shook his head sadly . \"I fear for his safety . \" Then it was time for him to leave . \"Must catch a flight to France,\" he said, rising slowly and shakin g my hand . He peered into my eyes . \"Why don't you write a book?\" H e gave me an encouraging nod . \"It's in you . But remember, make i t about things that matter .\" He turned and walked away . Then h e stopped and came back a few steps into the restaurant . \"Don't worry,\" he said . \"The general will prevail . He'll get th e Canal back . \" Torrijos did get it back . In that same year, 1977, he successfull y negotiated new treaties with President Carter that transferred th e Canal Zone and the Canal itself over to Panamanian control . The n the White House had to con v ince the U .S . Congress to ratify it . A long and arduous battle ensued . In the final tally, the Canal Treat y was ratified by a single vote . Conservatives swore revenge .

Sometimes I com- muted between Latin America or Indonesia and Tehran . The Sha h of Shahs (literally, \"King of Kings,\" his official title) presented a com - pletely different situation from that in the other countries where w e worked . Iran was oil rich and, like Saudi Arabia, it did not need to incu r debt in order to finance its ambitious list of projects . However, Ira n differed significantly from Saudi Arabia in that its large population , while predominantly Middle Eastern and Muslim, was not Arabic . In addition, the country had a history of political turmoil — both in- ternally and in its relationships with its neighbors . Therefore, w e took a different approach : Washington and the business communit y joined forces to turn the shah into a symbol of progress . We launched an immense effort to show the world what a strong , democratic friend of U .S . corporate and political interests could ac- complish . Never mind his obviously undemocratic title or the les s obvious fact of the CIA-orchestrated coup against his democraticall y elected premier ; Washington and its European partners were de- termined to present the shah's government as an alternative to thos e in Iraq, Libya, China, Korea, and other nations where a powerfu l undercurrent of anti-Americanism was surfacing . To all appearances, the shah was a progressive friend of the under - privileged . In 1962, he ordered large private landholdings broken u p and turned over to peasant owners . The following year, he inaugurated his White Revolution, which involved an extensive agenda for socio - economic reforms . The power of OPEC grew during the 197os, an d the shah became an increasingly influential world leader . At th e same time, Iran developed one of the most powerful military force s in the Muslim Middle East . ' MAIN was involved in projects that covered most of the country , from tourist areas along the Caspian Sea in the north to secret mil- itary installations overlooking the Straits of Hormuz in the south . Once again, the focus of our work was to forecast regional develop- ment potentials and then to design electrical generating, transmis- sion, and distribution systems that would provide the all-importan t energy required to fuel the industrial and commercial growth tha t would realize these forecasts . I visited most of the major regions of Iran at one time or another . I followed the old caravan trail through the desert mountains, fro m Kirman to Bandar 'Abbas, and I roamed the ruins of Persepolis, th e legendary palace of ancient kings and one of the wonders of the clas- sical world . I toured the country's most famous and spectacular sites : Shiraz, Isfahan, and the magnificent tent city near Persepolis wher e the shah had been crowned . In the process, I developed a genuin e love for this land and its complex people . On the surface, Iran seemed to be a model example of Christian - Muslim cooperation . However, I soon learned that tranquil appear- ances may mask deep resentment . Late one evening in 1977, I returned to my hotel room to find a note shoved under my door . I was shocked to discover that it wa s signed by a man named Yamin . I had never met him, but he ha d been described to me during a government briefing as a famous an d most subversive radical . In beautifully crafted English script, th e note invited me to meet him at a designated restaurant . However , there was a warning : I was to come only if I was interested in ex- ploring a side of Iran that most people \"in my position\" never saw . I wondered whether Yamin knew what my true position was . I real- ized that I was taking a big risk ; however, I could not resist th e temptation to meet this enigmatic figure . My taxi dropped me off in front of a tiny gate in a high wall — s o high that I could not see the building behind it . A beautiful Irania n woman wearing a long black gown ushered me in and led me dow n a corridor illuminated by ornate oil lamps hanging from a low ceiling . 108 \t Iran ' s King of Kings 109"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"At the end of this corridor, we entered a room that dazzled like th e interior of a diamond, blinding me with its radiance . When my eye s finally adjusted . I saw that the walls were inlaid with semipreciou s stones and mother-of-pearl . The restaurant was lighted by tall whit e candles protruding from intricately sculpted bronze chandeliers . A tall man with long black hair, wearing a tailored nary blue suit , approached and shook my hand . He introduced himself as Yamin, i n an accent that suggested he was an Iranian who had been educate d in the British school system, and I was immediately struck by ho w little he looked like a subversive radical . He directed me past severa l tables where couples sat quietly eating, to a very private alcove ; h e assured me we could talk in complete confidentiality . I had the dis - tinct impression that this restaurant catered to secret rendezvous . Ours, quite possibly, was the only non-amorous one that night . Yamin was very cordial . During our discussion, it became obviou s that he thought of me merely as an economic consultant, not a s someone with ulterior motives . He explained that he had singled m e out because he knew I had been a Peace Corps volunteer and be - cause he had been told that I took every possible opportunity to ge t to know his country and to mix with its people . \"You are very young compared to most in your profession,\" h e said . \"You have a genuine interest in our history and our curren t problems . You represent our hope . \" This, as well as the setting, his appearance, and the presence of s o many others in the restaurant, gave me a certain degree of comfort . I had become accustomed to people befriending me, like Rasy i n Java and Fidel in Panama, and I accepted it as a compliment and a n opportunity . I knew that I stood out from other Americans becaus e I was in fact infatuated with the places I visited . I have found tha t people warm to you very quickly if you open your eyes, ears, an d heart to their culture . Yamin asked if I knew about the Flowering Desert project . 2 \"Th e shah believes that our deserts were once fertile plains and lus h forests . At least, that's what he claims . During Alexander the Great' s reign, according to this theory, vast armies swept across these lands , traveling with millions of goats and sheep . The animals ate all th e grass and other vegetation . The disappearance of these plants cause d a drought, and eventually the entire region became a desert . Now al l we have to do, or so the shah says, is plant millions upon millions of trees . After that — presto — the rains will return and the desert wil l bloom again . Of course, in the process we will have to spend hun- dreds of millions of dollars . \" He smiled condescendingly . \" Companie s like yours will reap huge profits . \" \"I take it you don't believe in this theory . \" `\"The desert is a symbol . Turning it green is about much mor e than agriculture . \" Several waiters descended upon us with trays of beautifully pre - sented Iranian food . Asking my permission first, Yamin proceeded t o select an assortment from the various trays . Then he turned bac k to me . 'A question for you, Mr . Perkins, if I might be so bold . What de - stroyed the cultures of your own native peoples, the Indians? \" I responded that I felt there had been many factors, includin g greed and superior weapons . \"Yes . True . All of that . But more than anything else, did it no t come down to a . destruction of the environment?\" He went on to ex - plain how once forests and animals such as the buffalo are destroyed , and once people are moved onto reservations, the very foundation s of cultures collapse . \"You see, it is the same here,\" he said . \"The desert is our environ - ment . The Flowering Desert project threatens nothing less than th e destruction of our entire fabric . How can we allow this to happen? \" I told him that it was my understanding that the whole idea be - hind the project carne from his people . He responded with a cynica l laugh, saying that the idea was planted in the shah's mind by my ow n United States government, and that the shah was just a puppet o f that government . \"A true Persian would never permit such a thing,\" Yamin said . Then he launched into a long dissertation about the relationship be - tween his people — the Bedouins — and the desert . He emphasize d the fact that many urbanized Iranians take their vacations in th e desert . They set up tents large enough for the entire family an d spend a week or more living in them . \"We— my people—are part of the desert . The people the sha h claims to rule with that iron hand of his are not just of the desert . W e are the desert . \" After that, he told me stories about his personal experiences i n the desert . When the evening was over, he escorted me back to th e 110 \t Part III : 1975-1981 \t Iran ' s King of Kings \t 111"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"tiny door in the large wall . My taxi was waiting in the street outside . Yamin shook my hand and expressed his appreciation for the time I had spent with him .

He may shock you , but I assure you that meeting him will be well worth your time .\" CHAPTER 1 9 Confessions of a Tortured Ma n Several days later, Yamin drove me out of Tehran, through a dust y and impoverished shantytown, along an old camel trail, and ou t to the edge of the desert . With the sun setting behind the city , he stopped his car at a cluster of tiny mud shacks surrounded b y palm trees . \"A very old oasis,\" he explained, \"dating back centuries befor e Marco Polo .\" He preceded me to one of the shacks . \"The man insid e has a PhD from one of your most prestigious universities . For rea- sons that will soon be clear, he must remain nameless . You can cal l him Doc . \" He knocked on the wooden door, and there was a muffled re- sponse . Yamin pushed the door open and led me inside . The tin y room was windowless and lit only by an oil lamp on a low table i n one corner . As my eyes adjusted, I saw that the dirt floor was covere d with Persian carpets . Then the shadowy outline of a man began t o emerge . He was seated in front of the lamp in a way that kept hi s features hidden . I could tell only that he was bundled in blanket s and was wearing something around his head . He sat in a wheelchair , and other than the table, this was the only piece of furniture in th e room . Yamin motioned for me to sit on a carpet . He went up an d gently embraced the man, speaking a few words in his ear, then re - turned and sat at my side . `\"I've told you about Mr . Perkins,\" he said . \"We're both honored t o have this opportunity to visit with you, sir . \" 112 \t Part III : 1975—1981 \t 113"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"\"Mr . Perkins . You are welcome .\" The voice, with barely any de- tectable accent, was low and hoarse . I found myself leaning forwar d into the small space between us as he said, \"You see before you a broken man . I have not always been so . Once I was strong like you . I was a close and trusted adviser to the shah .\" There was a long pause . \"The Shah of Shahs, King of Kings .\" His tone of voice sounded, I thought, more sad than angry . \"I personally knew many of the world's leaders . Eisenhower, Nixon , de Gaulle . They trusted me to help lead this country into the capi- talist camp . The shah trusted me, and,\" he made a sound that coul d have been a cough, but which I took for a laugh, \"I trusted the shah . I believed his rhetoric . I was convinced that Iran would lead th e Muslim world into a new epoch, that Persia would fulfill its promise . It seemed our destiny — the shah's, mine, all of ours who carried ou t the mission we thought we had been born to fulfill . \" The lump of blankets moved ; the wheelchair made a wheezin g noise and turned slightly . I could see the outline of the man's face i n profile, his shaggy beard, and—then it grabbed me—the flatness . He had no nose! I shuddered and stifled a gasp . \"Not a pretty' sight, would you say, ah, Mr . Perkins? Too bad yo u can't see it in full light . It is truly grotesque .\" Again there was th e sound of choking laughter . \"But as I'm sure you can appreciate, I mus t remain anonymous . Certainly, you could learn my identity if yo u tried, although you might find that I am dead . Officially, I no longe r exist . Yet I trust you won't try . You and your family are better off no t knowing who I am . The arm of the shah and SAVAK reaches far . \" The chair wheezed and returned to its original position . I felt a sense of relief, as though not seeing the profile somehow obliterate d the violence that had been done . At the time, I did not know of thi s custom among some Islamic cultures . Individuals deemed to hav e brought dishonor or disgrace upon society or its leaders are pun- ished by having their noses cut off . In this way, they' are marked fo r life — as this man's face clearly demonstrated . \"I'm sure, Mr . Perkins, you're wondering why we invited you here . \" Without waiting for my response, the man in the wheelchair con- tinued, \"You see, this man who calls himself the King of Kings is i n reality satanic . His father was deposed by your CIA with — I hate t o say it — my help, because he was said to be a Nazi collaborator . An d then there was the Mossadegh calamity . Today, our shah is on the route to surpassing Hitler in the realms of evil . He does this with th e full knowledge and support of your government . \" \"Why is that? \" I asked . `\"Quite simple . He is your only real ally in the Middle East, an d the industrial world rotates on the axle of oil that is the Middle East . Oh, you have Israel, of course, but that ' s actually a liability to you , not an asset . And no oil there .

W e Persians hate him .\" Then silence . I could hear only his heavy breath - ing, as though the exertion had exhausted him . \"Doc is very close to the mullahs,\" Yamin said to me, his voice lo w and calm . \"There is a huge undercurrent among the religious faction s here and it pervades most of our country, except for a handful o f people in the commercial classes who benefit from the shah' s capitalism . \" \"I don't doubt you,\" I said . \"But I must say that during four visit s here, I've seen nothing of it . Everyone I talk with seems to love th e shah, to appreciate the economic upsurge . \" \"You don't speak Farsi,\" Yamin observed . \"You hear only what i s told to you by those men who benefit the most . The ones who hav e been educated in the States or in England end up working for th e shah . Doc here is an exception — now . \" He paused, seeming to ponder his next words . \"It's the same wit h your press . They only talk with the few who are his kin, his circle .

I knew that ou r information about you was correct—you are a man between tw o worlds, a man in the middle . \" It made me wonder just how much he did know about me . CHAPTER 2 0 The Fall of a Kin g One evening in 1978, while I was sitting alone at the luxurious ba r off the lobby of the Hotel InterContinental in Tehran, I felt a tap o n my shoulder . I turned to see a heavyset Iranian in a business suit . \"John Perkins! You don't remember me? \" The former soccer player had gained a lot of weight, but the voic e was unmistakable . It was my old Middlebury friend Farhad, who m I had not seen in more than a decade . We embraced and sat dow n together . It quickly became obvious that he knew all about me an d about my work . It was equally obvious that he did not intend t o share much about his own work . \"Let's get right to the point,\" he said as we ordered our secon d beers . \"I'm flying to Rome tomorrow . My parents live there . I have a ticket for you on my flight . Things are falling apart here . You've go t to get out .\" He handed me an airline ticket . I did not doubt him fo r a moment . In Rome, we dined with Farhad's parents . His father, the retire d Iranian general who once stepped in front of a would-be assassin' s bullet to save the shah's life, expressed disillusionment with his for - mer boss . He said that during the past few years the shah had showe d his true colors, his arrogance and greed . The general blamed U .S . policy — particularly its backing of Israel, of corrupt leaders, and o f despotic governments—for the hatred sweeping the Middle East , and he predicted that the shah would be gone within months . \"You know,\" he said, \"you sowed the seeds of this rebellion in th e 116 \t Part III : 1975—1981 \t 117"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"early fifties, when you overthrew Mossadegh . You thought it ver y clever back then — as did I . But now it returns to haunt you — us .\" ' I was astounded by his pronouncements . I had heard somethin g similar from Yamin and Doc, but coming from this man it took o n new significance . By this time, everyone knew of the existence of a fundamentalist Islamic underground, but we had convinced our - selves that the shah was immensely popular among the majority o f his people and was therefore politically invincible . The general , however, was adamant . `\"Mark my words,\" he said solemnly, \"the shah's fall will be only th e beginning . It's a preview of where the Muslim world is headed . Ou r rage has smoldered beneath the sands too long . Soon it will erupt . \" Over dinner, I heard a great deal about Ayatollah Ruhollah Kho - meini . Farhad and his father made it clear that they did not suppor t his fanatical Shiism, but they were obviously impressed by the in - roads he had made against the shah . They told me that this cleric , whose given name translates to \"inspired of God,\" was born into a family of dedicated Shiite scholars in a village near Tehran, in 1902 . Khomeini had made it a point not to become involved in th e Mossadegh-shah struggles of the early 1950s, but he actively op - posed the shah in the 1960s, criticizing the ruler so adamantly tha t he was banished to Turkey, then to the Shiite holy city of An Najaf i n Iraq, where he became the acknowledged leader of the opposition . He sent out letters, articles, and tape-recorded messages urging Ira - nians to rise up, overthrow the shah, and create a clerical state . Two days after that dinner with Farhad and his parents, new s came out of Iran of bombings and riots . Ayatollah Khomeini and th e mullahs had begun the offensive that would soon give them control . After that, things happened fast . The rage Farhad's father had de - scribed exploded in a violent Islamic uprising . The shah fled hi s country for Egypt in January 1979, and then, diagnosed with cancer , headed for a New York Hospital . Followers of the Ayatollah Khomeini demanded his return . I n November 1979, a militant Islamic mob seized the United State s Embassy in Tehran and held fifty-two American hostages for th e next 444 days .2 President Carter attempted to negotiate the releas e of the hostages . When this failed, he authorized a military rescu e mission, launched in April 1980 . It was a disaster, and it turned out to be the hammer that would drive the final nail into Carter's presi- dential coffin . Tremendous pressure, exerted by U .S . commercial and politica l groups, forced the cancer-ridden shah to leave the United States . From the day he fled Tehran he had a difficult time finding sanctu - ary ; all his former friends shunned him . However, General Torrijo s exhibited his customary compassion and offered the shah asylum i n Panama, despite a personal dislike of the shah's politics . The sha h arrived and received sanctuary at the very same resort where th e new Panama Canal Treaty had so recently been negotiated . The mullahs demanded the shah's return in exchange for th e hostages held in the U .S . Embassy . Those in Washington who ha d opposed the Canal Treaty accused Torrijos of corruption and collu - sion with the shah, and of endangering the lives of U .S . citizens . The y too demanded that the shah be turned over to Ayatollah Khomeini . Ironically, until only a few weeks earlier, many of these same peopl e had been the shah's staunchest supporters . The once-proud King o f Kings eventually returned to Egypt, where he died of cancer . Doe's prediction came true . MAIN lost millions of dollars in Iran , as did many of our competitors . Carter lost his bid for reelection . The Reagan-Bush administration marched into Washington wit h promises to free the hostages, to bring down the mullahs, to retur n democracy to Iran, and to set straight the Panama Canal situation . For me, the lessons were irrefutable . Iran illustrated beyond an y doubt that the United States was a nation laboring to deny the trut h of our role in the world . It seemed incomprehensible that we coul d have been so misinformed about the shah and the tide of hatred tha t had surged against him . Even those of us in companies like MAIN , which had offices and personnel in the country, had not known . I fel t certain that the NSA and the CIA must have seen what had been s o obvious to Torrijos even as far back as my meeting with him in 1972 , but that our own intelligence community had intentionally encour- aged us all to close our eyes . 118 \t Part III : 1975—1981 \t The Fall of a King \t 119"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2 1 Colombia : Keystone of Latin Americ a While Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Panama offered fascinating and dis- turbing studies, they also stood out as exceptions to the rule . Due t o vast oil deposits in the first two and the Canal in the third, they di d not fit the norm . Colombia's situation was more typical, and MAI N was the designer and lead engineering firm on a huge hydroelectri c project there . A Colombian college professor writing a book on the history o f Pan-American relations once told me that Teddy Roosevelt had ap- preciated the significance of his country . Pointing at a map, the U .S . president and former Rough Rider reportedly described Colombi a as \"the keystone to the arch of South America .\" I have never verifie d that story ; however, it is certainly true that on a map Colombia , poised at the top of the continent, appears to hold the rest of th e continent together . It connects all the southern countries to the Isth- mus of Panama and therefore to both Central and North America . Whether Roosevelt actually described Colombia in those terms o r not, he was only one of many presidents who understood its pivota l position . For nearly two centuries, the United States has viewe d Colombia as a keystone—or perhaps more accurately, as a porta l into the southern hemisphere for both business and politics . The country also is endowed with great natural beauty : spectac- ular palm-lined beaches on both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, ma- jestic mountains, pampas that rival the Great Plains of the Nort h American Midwest, and vast rain forests rich in biodiversity . The people, too, have a special quality, combining the physical, cultural , and artistic traits of diverse ethnic backgrounds ranging from the loca l Taironas to imports from Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Middle East . Historically, Colombia has played a crucial role in Latin Ameri- can history and culture . During the colonial period, Colombia wa s the seat of the viceroy for all Spanish territories north of Peru an d south of Costa Rica . The great fleets of gold galleons set sail from it s coastal city of Cartagena to transport priceless treasures from as fa r south as Chile and Argentina to ports in Spain . Many of the critica l actions in the wars for independence occurred in Colombia ; for ex - ample, forces under Simon Bolivar were victorious over Spanish roy - alists at the pivotal Battle of Boyaca, in 1819 . In modern times, Colombia has had a reputation for producin g some of Latin America's most brilliant writers, artists, philosophers, an d other intellectuals, as well as fiscally responsible and relatively dem- ocratic governments . It became the model for President Kennedy' s nation-building programs throughout Latin America . Unlike Guate- mala, its government was not tarnished with the reputation of bein g a CIA creation, and unlike Nicaragua, the government was an electe d one, which presented an alternative to both right-wing dictators an d Communists . Finally, unlike so many other countries, includin g powerful Brazil and Argentina, Colombia did not mistrust the Unite d States . The image of Colombia as a reliable ally has continued, de - spite the blemish of its drug cartels . l The glories of Colombia's history, however, are counterbalance d by hatred and violence . The seat of the Spanish viceroy was also hom e to the Inquisition . Magnificent forts, haciendas, and cities were con- structed over the bones of Indian and African slaves . The treasure s carried on the gold galleons, sacred objects and masterpieces of ar t that had been melted down for easy transport, were ripped from th e hearts of ancient peoples . The proud cultures themselves were lai d to waste by conquistador swords and diseases . More recently, a con- troversial presidential election in 1945 resulted in a deep division be - tween political parties and led to La Violencia (1948-1957), durin g which more than two hundred thousand people died . Despite the conflicts and ironies, both Washington and Wal l Street historically have viewed Colombia as an essential factor i n promoting Pan-American political and commercial interests . This i s due to several factors, in addition to Colombia's critical geographi c 120 \t Columbia : Keystone of Latin America 121"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"location, including the perception that leaders throughout the hemi - sphere look to Bogota for inspiration and guidance, and the fact that . the country is both a source of many products purchased in th e United States — coffee, bananas, textiles, emeralds, flowers, oil, an d cocaine — and a market for our goods and services . One of the most important services we sold to Colombia . durin g the late twentieth century was engineering and construction ex- pertise . Colombia was typical of many places where I worked . It wa s relatively easy to demonstrate that the country could assume vas t amounts of debt and then repay these debts from the benefits real- ized both from the projects themselves and from the country's nat- ural resources . Thus, huge investments in electrical power grids , highways, and telecommunications would help Colombia open u p its vast gas and oil resources and its largely undeveloped Amazonia n territories ; these projects, in turn, would generate the income nec- essary to pay off the loans, plus interest . That was the theory . However, the reality, consistent with ou r true intent around the world, was to subjugate Bogota, to further th e global empire . My job, as it had been in so many places, was to pre - sent the case for exceedingly large loans . Colombia did not have th e benefit of a Torrijos ; therefore, I felt I had no choice but to develo p inflated economic and electric load forecasts . With the exception of the occasional bouts of guilt over my job , Colombia became a personal refuge for me . Ann and I had spent a couple of months there in the early 1970s, and had even made a dow n payment on a small coffee farm located in the mountains along th e Caribbean coast . I think our time together during that period cam e as close as anything could to healing the wounds we had inflicted o n each other over the preceding years . Ultimately, however, the wound s went too deep, and it was not until after our marriage fell apart tha t I became truly acquainted with the country . During the 1970s, MAIN had been awarded a number of con - tracts to develop various infrastructure projects, including a networ k of hydroelectric facilities and the distribution systems to transpor t the electricity from deep in the jungle to cities high in the moun- tains . I was given an office in the coastal city of Barranquilla, and i t was there, in 1977, that I met a beautiful Colombian woman wh o would become a powerful agent of change in my life . Paula had long blond hair and striking green eyes—not wha t most foreigners expect in a Colombian . Her mother and father ha d emigrated from northern Italy, and in keeping with her heritage, sh e became a fashion designer . She went a step further, however, and buil t a small factory where her creations were transformed into clothes , which she then sold at upscale boutiques throughout the country, a s well as in Panama and Venezuela . She was a deeply compassionat e person who helped me get through some of the personal trauma o f my broken marriage and begin dealing with some of my attitudes to - ward women, which had affected me so negatively . She also taught m e a great deal about the consequences of the actions I took in my job . As I have said before, life is composed of a series of coincidence s over which we have no control . For me, those included being raise d as the son of a teacher at an all-male prep school in rural New Hamp - shire, meeting Ann and her Uncle Frank, the Vietnam War, an d meeting Einar Greve . However, once we are presented with such co - incidences, we face choices . How we respond, the actions we take i n the face of coincidences, makes all the difference . For example, ex- celling at that school, marrying Ann, entering the Peace Corps, an d choosing to become an economic hit man -- all these decisions ha d brought me to my current place in life . Paula was another coincidence, and her influence would lead m e to take actions that changed the course of my life . Until I met her, I had pretty much gone along with the system . I often found mysel f questioning what I was doing, sometimes feeling guilty about it, ye t I always discovered a way to rationalize staying in the system . Per- haps Paula just happened along at the right time . It is possible tha t I would have taken the plunge anyway, that my experiences in Saud i Arabia, Iran, and Panama would have nudged me into action . Bu t I am certain that even as one woman, Claudine, had been instru- mental in persuading me to join the ranks of EHMs, another, Paula , was the catalyst I needed at that time . She convinced me to go dee p inside myself and see that I would never be happy as long as I con- tinued in that role . 122 Part III : 1975—1981 \t Columbia : Keystone of Latin America 123"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2 2 American Republic versu s Global Empir e \"I'll be frank,\" Paula said one day, while we were sitting in a coffe e shop . \"The Indians and all the farmers who live along the river you'r e damming hate you . Even people in the cities, who aren't directly af- fected, sympathize with the guerrillas who've been attacking you r construction camp . Your government calls these people Communists , terrorists, and narcotics traffickers, but the truth is they're just peopl e with families who live on lands your company is destroying . \" I had just told her about Manuel Torres . He was an engineer em- ployed by MAIN and one of the men recently attacked by guerrilla s at our hydroelectric dam construction site . Manuel was a Colombia n citizen who had a job because of a U .S . Department of State rule pro - hibiting us from sending U .S . citizens to that site . We referred to it a s the Colombians are Expendable doctrine, and it symbolized an atti- tude I had grown to hate . My feelings toward such policies wer e making it increasingly difficult for me to live with myself . \"According to Manuel, they fired AK-47s into the air and at hi s feet,\" I told Paula . \"He sounded calm when he told me about it, bu t I know he was almost hysterical . They didn't shoot anyone . Just gav e them that letter and sent them downriver in their boats . \" \"My God,\" Paula exclaimed . \"The poor man was terrified . \" \"Of course he was .\" I told her that I had asked Manuel whether h e thought they were FARC or M-I9, referring to two of the most infa- mous Colombian guerrilla groups . \"And ? \" \"He said, neither . But he told me that he believes what they sai d in that letter . \" Paula picked up the newspaper I had brought and read the lette r aloud . \"`We, who work every day just to survive, swear on the blood o f our ancestors that we will never allow dams across our rivers . We ar e simple Indians and mestizos, but we would rather die than stand b y as our land is flooded . We warn our Colombian brothers : stop work- ing for the construction companies . – She set the paper down . \"Wha t did you say to him? \" I hesitated, but only for a moment . \"I had no choice . I had to to e the company line . I asked him if he thought that sounds like a lette r a farmer would write . \" She sat watching me, patiently . \"He just shrugged .\" Our eyes met . \"Oh, Paula, I detest myself fo r playing this role . \" \"What did you do next?\" she pressed . \"I slammed my fist on the desk . I intimidated him . I asked hi m whether farmers with AK-47s made any sense to him . Then I aske d if he knew who invented the AK-47 . \" \"Did he? \" \"Yes, but I could hardly hear his answer . A Russian,' he said . O f course, I assured him that he was right, that the inventor had bee n a Communist named Kalashnikov, a highly decorated officer in th e Red Army . I brought him around to understand that the people wh o wrote that note were Communists . \" \"Do you believe that?\" she asked . Her question stopped me . How could I answer, honestly? I recalle d Iran and the time Yamin described me as a man caught between tw o worlds, a man in the middle . In some ways, I wished I had been in tha t camp when the guerrillas attacked, or that I was one of the guerrillas . An odd feeling crept over me, a sort of jealousy for Yamin and Doc an d the Colombian rebels . These were men with con v ictions . They ha d chosen real worlds, not a no-man's territory somewhere between . \"I have a job to do,\" I said at last . She smiled gently . \"I hate it,\" I continued . I thought about the men whose image s had come to me so often over the years, Tom Paine and other Revo- lutionary War heroes, pirates and frontiersmen . They stood at th e 124 \t American Republic versus Global Empire 125"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"edges, not in the middle . They had taken stands and lived with th e consequences . \"Every day I come to hate my job a little more . \" She took my hand . \" Your job? \" Our eyes met and held . I understood the implication . \"Myself . \" She squeezed my hand and nodded slowly . I felt an immediat e sense of relief, just admitting it . \"What will you do, John? \" I had no answer . The relief turned into defensiveness . I stam- mered out the standard justifications : that I was trying to do good , that I was exploring ways to change the system from within, and — the old standby—that if I quit, someone even worse would fill m y shoes . But I could see from the way she watched me that she was no t buying it . Even worse, I knew that I was not buying it either . She ha d forced me to understand the essential truth : it was not my job, bu t me, that was to blame . \"What about you?\" I asked at last . \"What do you believe? \" She gave a little sigh and released my hand, asking, \"You trying t o change the subject? \" I nodded . \"Okay,\" she agreed . \"Under one condition . That we'll return to i t another day .\" She picked up a spoon and appeared to examine it . \" I know that some of the guerrillas have trained in Russia and China . \" She lowered the spoon into her cafe con leche, stirred, and then slowl y licked the spoon . \"What else can they do? They need to learn abou t modern weapons and how to fight the soldiers who've gone throug h your schools . Sometimes they sell cocaine in order to raise money fo r supplies . How else can they buy guns? They're up against terribl e odds . Your World Bank doesn't help them defend themselves .

The electricity will help only a few, the wealth - iest Colombians, and thousands will die because the fish and wate r are poisoned, after you build that dam of yours . \" Hearing her speak so compassionately about the people who op - posed us — me — caused my flesh to crawl . I found myself clawing a t my forearms . \"How do you know so much about the guerrillas?\" Even as I asked it, I had a sinking feeling, a premonition that I did not want t o know the answer . \"1 went to school with some of them,\" she said . She hesitated , pushed her cup away . \"My brother joined the movement . \" There it was . I felt absolutely deflated . I thought I knew all abou t her, but this . . . I had the fleeting image of a man coming home to fin d his wife in bed with another man . \"How come you never told me? \" \"Seemed irrelevant . Why would I? It isn't something I bra g about .\" She paused . \"I haven't seen him for two years . He has to b e very careful . \" \"How do you know he's alive? \" \"I don't, except recently the government put him on a wanted list . That's a good sign . \" I was fighting the urge to be judgmental or defensive . I hoped sh e could not discern my jealousy . \"How did he become one of them? \" I asked . Fortunately, she kept her eyes on the coffee cup . \"Demonstratin g outside the offices of an oil company—Occidental, I think . He wa s protesting drilling on indigenous lands, in the forests of a tribe facin g extinction — him and a couple dozen of his friends . They were attacke d by the army, beaten, and thrown into prison—for doing nothin g illegal, mind you, just standing outside that building waving placard s and singing .\" She glanced out a nearby window . \"They kept him i n jail for nearly six months . He never did tell us what happened there , but when he came out he was a different person . \" It was the first of many similar conversations with Paula, and I now know that these discussions set the stage for what was to follow . My soul was torn apart, yet I was still ruled by my wallet and b y those other weaknesses the NSA had identified when they profile d me a decade earlier, in 1968 . By forcing me to see this and to con - front the deeper feelings behind my fascination with pirates an d other rebels, Paula helped me along the trail toward salvation . Beyond my own personal dilemmas, my times in Colombia als o helped me comprehend the distinction between the old America n republic and the new global empire . The republic offered hope to th e world . Its foundation was moral and philosophical rather tha n materialistic . It was based on concepts of equality and justice for all . But it also could be pragmatic, not merely a utopian dream but als o a living, breathing, magnanimous entity . It could open its arms t o 126 \t Part III : 1975—1981 \t American Republic versus Global Empire \t 127"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"shelter the downtrodden . It was an inspiration and at the same tim e a force to reckon with ; if needed, it could swing into action, as i t had during World War II, to defend the principles for which it stood . The very institutions — the big corporations, banks, and governmen t bureaucracies — that threaten the republic could be used instead t o institute fundamental changes in the world . Such institutions posses s the communications networks and transportation systems necessar y to end disease, starvation, and even wars — if only they could be con- vinced to take that course . The global empire, on the other hand, is the republic's nemesis . I t is self-centered, self-serving, greedy, and materialistic, a syste m based on mercantilism . Like empires before, its arms open only t o accumulate resources, to grab everything in sight and stuff its insa- tiable maw . It will use whatever means it deems necessary to help it s rulers gain more power and riches . Of course, in learning to understand this distinction I also devel- oped a clearer sense of my own role . Claudine had warned me ; sh e had honestly outlined what would be expected of me if I accepte d the job MAIN offered . Yet, it took the experience of working in coun - tries like Indonesia, Panama, Iran, and Colombia in order for me t o understand the deeper implications . And it took the patience, love , and personal stories of a woman like Paula . I was loyal to the American republic, but what we were perpe- trating through this new, highly subtle form of imperialism was th e financial equivalent of what we had attempted to accomplish mili- tarily in Vietnam . If Southeast Asia had taught us that armies hav e limitations, the economists had responded by devising a better plan , and the foreign aid agencies and the private contractors who serve d them (or, more appropriately, were served by them) had becom e proficient at executing that plan . In countries on every continent, I saw how men and wome n working for U .S . corporations — though not officially part of th e EHM network — participated in something far more pernicious tha n anything en v isioned in conspiracy theories . Like many of MAIN' s engineers, these workers were blind to the consequences of their ac - tions, con v inced that the sweatshops and factories that made shoe s and automotive parts for their companies were helping the poo r climb out of poverty, instead of simply burying them deeper in a type of slavery reminiscent of medieval manors and southern plantations . Like those earlier manifestations of exploitation, modern serfs or slave s were socialized into believing they were better off than the unfortu- nate souls who lived on the margins, in the dark hollows of Europe , in the jungles of Africa, or in the wilds of the American frontier . The struggle over whether I should continue at MAIN or shoul d quit had become an open battlefield . There was no doubt that m y conscience wanted out, but that other side, what I liked to think o f as my business-school . persona, was not so sure . My own ernpire kep t expanding ; I added employees, countries, and shares of stock to m y various portfolios and to my ego . In addition to the seduction of th e money and lifestyle, and the adrenaline high of power, I often re - called Claudine warning me that once I was in I could never get out . Of course, Paula sneered at this . \"What would she know? \" I pointed out that Claudine had been right about a great man y things . \"That was a long time ago . Lives change . Anyway, what differenc e does it make? You're not happy with yourself . What can Claudine o r anyone else do to make things worse than that? \" It was a refrain Paula often came back to, and I eventually agreed . I admitted to her and to myself that all the money, adventure, an d glamour no longer justified the turmoil, guilt, and stress . As a MAIN partner, I was becoming wealthy, and I knew that if I staye d longer I would be permanently trapped . One day, while we were strolling along the beach near the ol d Spanish fort at Cartagena, a place that had endured countless pirat e attacks, Paula hit upon an approach that had not occurred to me . \"What if you never say anything about the things you know?\" sh e asked . `\"You mean . . . just keep quiet? \" \"Exactly . Don't give them an excuse to come after you . In fact , give them every reason to leave you alone, to not muddy the water . \" It made a great deal of sense — I wondered why it never occurre d to me before . I would not write books or do anything else to expos e the truth as I had come to see it . I would not be a crusader ; instead , I would just be a person, concentrate on enjoying life, travel fo r pleasure, perhaps even start a family with someone like Paula . I ha d had enough ; I simply wanted out . 128 \t Part III : 1975—1981 \t American Republic versus Global Empire 129"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"\"Everything Claudine taught you is a deception, \" Paula added . \"Your life's a lie .\" She smiled condescendingly . \"Have you looked a t your own resume recently? \" I admitted that I had not . \"Do,\" she advised . \"I read the Spanish version the other day . If it' s anything like the English one, I think you'll find it very interesting .\" CHAPTER 2 3 The Deceptive Resum e While I was in Colombia, word arrived that Jake Dauber had retire d as MAIN's president . As expected, chairman and CEO Mac Hall ap - pointed Bruno as Dauber's replacement . The phone lines betwee n Boston and Barranquilla went crazy . Everyone predicted that I, too , would soon be promoted ; after all, I was one of Bruno's most truste d proteges . These changes and rumors were an added incentive for me to re - view my own position . While still in Colombia, I followed Paula's ad - vice and read the Spanish version of my resume . It shocked me . Bac k in Boston, I pulled out both the English original and a Novembe r 1978 copy of MAINLINES, the corporate magazine ; that editio n featured me in an article titled, \"Specialists Offer MAIN'S Client s New Services .\" (See pages 133 and 134 . ) I once had taken great pride in that resume and that article, an d yet now, seeing them as Paula did, I felt a growing sense of ange r and depression . The material in these documents represented inten- tional deceptions, if not lies . And these documents carried a deepe r significance, a reality that reflected our times and reached to the cor e of our current march to global empire : they epitomized a strateg y calculated to convey appearances, to shield an underlying reality . I n a strange way, they symbolized the story of my life, a glossy venee r covering synthetic surfaces . Of course, it did not give me any great comfort to know that I ha d to take much of the responsibility for what was included in m y 130 \t Part III : 1975—1981 \t 131"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"resume . According to standard operating procedures, I was require d to constantly update both a basic resume and a file with pertinen t backup information about clients served and the type of work done . If a marketing person or project manager wanted to include me in a proposal or to use my credentials in some other way, he could massag e this basic data in a manner that emphasized his particular needs . For instance, he might choose to highlight my experience in th e Middle East, or in making presentations before the World Bank an d other multinational forums . Whenever this was done, that perso n was supposed to get my approval before actually publishing the re- vised resume . However, since like many other MAIN employee s I traveled a great deal, exceptions were frequently made . Thus, th e resume Paula suggested I look at, and its English counterpart, wer e completely new to me, although the information certainly was in- cluded in my file . At first glance, my resume seemed innocent enough . Under Ex- perience, it stated that I had been in charge of major projects in th e United States, Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East, and it pro- vided a laundry list of the types of projects : development planning , economic forecasting, energy demand forecasting, and so on . Thi s section ended by describing my Peace Corps work in Ecuador ; how - ever, it omitted any reference to the Peace Corps itself, leaving th e impression that I had been the professional manager of a constructio n materials company, instead of a volunteer assisting a small cooper- ative composed of illiterate Andean peasant brick makers . Following that was a long list of clients . This list included the In- ternational Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the officia l name of the World Bank) ; the Asian Development Bank ; the gov- ernment of Kuwait ; the Iranian Ministry of Energy ; the Arabian - American Oil Company of Saudi Arabia ; Instituto de Recurso s Hidraulicos y Electrification ; Perusahaan Umum Listrik Negara ; and many others . But the one that caught my attention was the fina l entry : U .S . Treasury Department, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia . I wa s amazed that such a listing had ever made it to print, even though i t was obviously part of my file . Setting aside the resume for a moment, I turned to the MAIN - LINES article . I clearly recalled my interview with its author, a ver y talented and well-intentioned young woman . She had given it to m e for my approval before publishing it .

As he spoke to er e Gorr across his desk, the inte r es t and support re holds for --is staf f was evident a'-d admirable . November 197 8 Specialists offe r MAI N ' s clients new service s ry Pauline Ouellette that she had painted such a flattering portrait of me, and I immedi- ately approved it . Once again, the responsibility fell on my shoulders . The article began : Looking over the faces behind the desks, it's easy to tel l that Economics and Regional Planning is one of the mos t recently formed and rapidly growing disciplines at MAIN . . . While several people were influential in getting th e economics group started, it basically came about throug h the efforts of one man, John Perkins, who is now head o f the group . Hired as an assistant to the head load forecaster i n January, 1971, John was one of the few economists work- ing for MAIN at the time . For his first assignment, h e was sent as part of an 11-man team to do an electricit y demand study in Indonesia . The article briefly summarized my previous work history, de - scribed how I had \"spent three years in Ecuador,\" and then contin- ued with the following : It was during this time that John Perkins met Eina r Greve (a former employee) [he had since left MAIN t o become president of the Tucson Gas & Electric Com- pany] who was working in the town of Paute, Ecuador , on a hydroelectric project for MAIN . The two becam e friendly and, through continual correspondence, Joh n was offered a position with MAIN . About a year later, John became the head load fore - caster and, as the demands from clients and institution s such as the World Bank grew, he realized that mor e economists were needed at MAIN . None of the statements in either document were outright lies — the backup for both documents was on the record, in my file ; how - ever, they conveyed a perception that I now found to be twisted an d sanitized . And in a culture that worships official documents, the y perpetrated something that was even more sinister . Outright lies ca n be refuted . Documents like those two were impossible to refut e 134 \t Part III : 1975—1981 \t The Deceptive Resume \t 135"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"because they were based on glimmers of truth, not open deceptions , and because they were produced by a corporation that had earne d the trust of other corporations, international banks, and governments . This was especially true of the resume because it was an officia l document, as opposed to the article, which was a bylined intervie w in a magazine . The MAIN logo, appearing on the bottom of the re- sume and on the covers of all the proposals and reports that resum e was likely to grace, carried a lot of weight in the world of interna- tional business ; it was a seal of authenticity that elicited the sam e level of confidence as those stamped on diplomas and framed cer- tificates hanging in doctors' and lawyers' offices . These documents portrayed me as a very competent economist , head of a department at a prestigious consulting firm, who was trav - eling around the globe conducting a broad range of studies tha t would make the world a more civilized and prosperous place . Th e deception was not in what was stated, but in what was omitted . I f I put on an outsider's hat—took a purely objective look—I had t o admit that those omissions raised many questions . For example, there was no mention of my recruitment by th e NSA or of Einar Greve's connection with the Army and his role as a n NSA liaison . There obviously was no discussion of the fact that I ha d been under tremendous pressure to produce highly inflated economi c forecasts, or that much of my job revolved around arranging hug e loans that countries like Indonesia and Panama could never repay . There was no praise for the integrity of my predecessor, Howar d Parker, nor any acknowledgment that I became the head load fore - caster because I was willing to provide the biased studies my bosse s wanted, rather than — like Howard — saying what I believed wa s true and getting fired as a result . Most puzzling was that final entry , under the list of my clients : U .S . Treasury Department, Kingdom o f Saudi Arabia . I kept returning to that line, and I wondered how people woul d interpret it . They might well ask what is the connection between th e U .S . Department of the Treasury and Saudi Arabia . Perhaps som e would take it as a typo, two separate lines erroneously compresse d into one . Most readers, though, would never guess the truth, that i t had been included for a specific reason . It was there so that those i n the inner circle of the world where I operated would understand tha t I had been part of the team that crafted the deal of the century, the deal that changed the course of world history but never reached th e newspapers . I helped create a covenant that guaranteed continue d oil for America, safeguarded the rule of the House of Saud, an d assisted in the financing of Osama bin Laden and the protection o f international criminals like Uganda ' s Idi Amin . That single line i n my resume spoke to those in the know . It said that MAIN's chie f economist was a man who could deliver . The final paragraph of the MAINLINES article was a persona l observation by the author, and it struck a raw nerve : The expansion of Economics and Regional Plannin g has been fast paced, yet John feels he has been lucky i n that each individual hired has been a hard-workin g professional . As he spoke to me from across his desk , the interest and support he holds for his staff was eviden t and admirable . The fact was that I had never thought of myself as a bona fid e economist . I had graduated with a bachelor of science in busines s administration from Boston University, emphasis on marketing . I had always been lousy in mathematics and statistics . At Middlebur y College, I had majored in American literature ; writing had com e easily to me . My status as chief economist and as manager of Eco- nomics and Regional Planning could not be attributed to my capa- bilities in either economics or planning ; rather, it was a function o f my willingness to provide the types of studies and conclusions m y bosses and clients wanted, combined with a natural acumen for per- suading others through the written word . In addition, I was cleve r enough to hire very competent people, many with master's degree s and a couple with PhDs, acquiring a staff who knew a whole lot mor e about the technicalities of my business than I did . Small wonder tha t the author of that article concluded that \"the interest and support h e holds for his staff was evident and admirable . \" I kept these two documents and several other similar ones in th e top drawer of my desk, and I returned to them frequently After - ward, I sometimes found myself outside my office, wandering amon g the desks of my staff, looking at those men and women who worke d for me and feeling guilty about what I had done to them, and abou t the role we all played in widening the gap between rich and poor .

I thought about the fact that people I trained had now joined th e ranks of EHMs . I had brought them in . I had recruited them an d trained them . But it had not been the same as when I joined . Th e world had shifted and the corporatocracy had progressed . We ha d gotten better or more pernicious . The people who worked for m e were a different breed from me . There had been no NSA polygraph s or Claudines in their lives . No one had spelled it out for them, wha t they were expected to do to carry on the mission of global empire . They had never heard the term economic hit man or even EHM, no r had they been told they were in for life . They simply had learne d from my example and from my system of rewards and punishments . They knew that they were expected to produce the types of studie s and results I wanted . Their salaries, Christmas bonuses, indeed thei r very jobs, depended on pleasing me . I, of course, had done everything I could imagine to lighten thei r burden . I had written papers, given lectures, and taken every possi- ble opportunity to convince them of the importance of optimisti c forecasts, of huge loans, of infusions of capital that would spur GN P growth and make the world a better place . It had required less tha n a decade to arrive at this point where the seduction, the coercion , had taken a much more subtle form, a sort of gentle style of brain - washing . Now these men and women who sat at desks outside m y office overlooking Boston's Back Bay were going out into the worl d to advance the cause of global empire . In a very real sense, I had cre - ated them, even as Claudine had created me . But unlike me, the y had been kept in the dark . Many nights I lay awake, thinking, fretting about these things . Paula's reference to my resume had opened a Pandora's box, and I often felt jealous of my employees for their naivete . I had intention - ally deceived them, and in so doing, had protected them from thei r own consciences . They did not have to struggle with the moral issue s that haunted me . I also thought a great deal about the idea of integrity in business , about appearances versus reality . Certainly I told myself, people hav e deceived each other since the beginning of history . Legend and folk - lore are full of tales about distorted truths and fraudulent deals : cheating rug merchants, usurious moneylenders, and tailors willin g to convince the emperor that his clothes are invisible only to him . However, much as I wanted to conclude that things were th e same as they always had been, that the facade of my MAIN resum e and the reality behind it were merely reflections of human nature, I knew in my heart this was not the case . Things had changed . I no w understood that we have reached a new level of deception, one tha t will lead to our own destruction — not only morally, but also physi - cally, as a culture — unless we make significant changes soon . The example of organized crime seemed to offer a metaphor . Mafi a bosses often start out as street thugs . But over time, the ones wh o make it to the top transform their appearance . They take to wearin g impeccably tailored suits, owning legitimate businesses, and wrap - ping themselves in the cloak of upstanding society . They support loca l charities and are respected by their communities . They are quick t o lend money to those in desperate straits . Like the John Perkins i n the MAIN resume, these men appear to be model citizens . However , beneath this patina is a trail of blood . When the debtors cannot pay , hit men move in to demand their pound of flesh . If this is no t granted, the jackals close in with baseball bats . Finally, as a last re - sort, out come the guns . I realized that my gloss as chief economist, head of Economic s and Regional Planning, was not the simple deception of a rug dealer , not something of which a buyer can beware . It was part of a siniste r system aimed not at outfoxing an unsuspecting customer, but rathe r at promoting the most subtle and effective form of imperialism th e world has ever known . Every one of the people on my staff also hel d a title — financial analyst, sociologist, economist, lead economist , econometrician, shadow pricing expert, and so forth — and yet non e of those titles indicated that every one of them was, in his or her ow n way, an EHM, that every one of them was serving the interests o f global empire . Nor did the fact of those titles among my staff suggest that w e were just the tip of the iceberg . Every major international compan y — from ones that marketed shoes and sporting goods to those tha t manufactured heavy equipment — had its own EHM equivalents . The march had begun and it was rapidly encircling the planet . Th e hoods had discarded their leather jackets, dressed up in busines s suits, and taken on an air of respectability .

By getting m e to read between the lines, Paula had nudged me to take one mor e step along a path that would ultimately transform my life . CHAPTER 2 4 Ecuador's President Battles Big Oi l My work in Colombia and Panama gave me many opportunities t o stay in touch with and to visit the first country to be my home awa y from home . Ecuador had suffered under a long line of dictators an d right-wing oligarchies manipulated by U .S . political and commercia l interests . In a way, the country was the quintessential banana re - public, and the corporatocracy had made major inroads there . The serious exploitation of oil in the Ecuadorian Amazon basi n began in the late 1960s, and it resulted in a buying spree in whic h the small club of families who ran Ecuador played into the hand s of the international banks . They saddled their country with hug e amounts of debt, backed by the promise of oil revenues . Roads an d industrial parks, hydroelectric dams, transmission and distributio n systems, and other power projects sprang up all over the country . International engineering and construction companies struck it ric h — once again . One man whose star was rising over this Andean country was th e exception to the rule of political corruption and complicity with th e corporatocracy . Jaime Roldos was a university professor and attor- ney in his late thirties, whom I had met on several occasions . He wa s charismatic and charming . Once, I impetuously offered to fly t o Quito and provide free consulting services any time he asked . I sai d it partially in jest, but also because I would gladly have done it on m y own vacation time — I liked him and, as I was quick to tell him, wa s always looking for a good excuse to visit his country . He laughed an d 140 \t Part III : 1975—1981 \t 141"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"offered me a similar deal, saying that whenever I needed to negoti- ate my oil bill, I could call on him . He had established a reputation as a populist and a nationalist, a person who believed strongly in the rights of the poor and in the re- sponsibility of politicians to use a country's natural resources pru- dently . When he began campaigning for the presidency in 1978, h e captured the attention of his countrymen and of citizens in every na - tion where foreign interests exploited oil — or where people desire d independence from the influences of powerful outside forces . Roldo s was the rare modern politician who was not afraid to oppose th e status quo . He went after the oil companies and the not-so-subtl e system that supported them . For instance, he accused the Summer Institute of Linguistic s (SIL), an evangelical missionary group from the United States, o f sinister collusion with the oil companies . I was familiar with SI L missionaries from my Peace Corps days . The organization had en- tered Ecuador, as it had so many other countries, under the pretex t of studying, recording, and translating indigenous languages . SIL had been working extensively with the Huaorani tribe in th e Amazon basin area, during the early years of oil exploration, when a disturbing pattern emerged . Whenever seismologists reported t o corporate headquarters that a certain region had characteristic s indicating a high probability of oil beneath the surface, SIL went i n and encouraged the indigenous people to move from that land, ont o missionary reservations ; there they would receive free food, shelter , clothes, medical treatment, and missionary-style education . The con - dition was that they had to deed their lands to the oil companies . Rumors abounded that SIL missionaries used an assortment o f underhanded techniques to persuade the tribes to abandon thei r homes and move to the missions . A frequently repeated story wa s that they had donated food heavily laced with laxatives — then offere d medicines to cure the diarrhea epidemic . Throughout Huaorani ter- ritory, SIL airdropped false-bottomed food baskets containing tin y radio transmitters ; receivers at highly sophisticated communication s stations, manned by U .S . military personnel at the army base i n Shell, tuned in to these transmitters . Whenever a member of th e tribe was bitten by a poisonous snake or became seriously ill, an SI L representative arrived with antivenom or the proper medicines — ofte n in oil company helicopters . During the early days of oil exploration, five SIL missionarie s were found dead with Huaorani spears protruding from their bod- ies . Later, the Huaoranis claimed they did this to send SIL a messag e to keep out . The message went unheeded . In fact, it ultimately ha d the opposite effect . Rachel Saint, the sister of one of the murdere d men, toured the United States, appearing on national television i n order to raise money and support for SIL and the oil companies, wh o she claimed were helping the \"savages\" become civilized and educated . SIL received funding from the Rockefeller charities . Jaime Roldo s claimed that these Rockefeller connections proved that SIL was re - ally a front for stealing indigenous lands and promoting oil explo- ration ; family scion John D . Rockefeller had founded Standard Oi l —which later divested into the majors, including Chevron, Exxon , and Mobil . . Roldos struck me as a man who walked the path blazed by Torrijos . Both stood up to the world's strongest superpower . Torrijos wante d to take back the Canal, while Roldos's strongly nationalistic positio n on oil threatened the world's most influential companies . Like Torrijos , Roldos was not a Communist, but rather stood for the right of hi s country to determine its own destiny . And as they had with Torrijos , pundits predicted that big business and Washington would neve r tolerate Roldos as president, that if elected he would meet a fat e similar to that of Guatemala's Arbenz or Chile's Allende . It seemed to me that the two men together might spearhead a new movement in Latin American politics and that this movemen t might form the foundation of changes that could affect every natio n on the planet . These men were not Castros or Gadhafis . They wer e not associated with Russia or China or, as in Allende's case, with th e international Socialist movement . They were popular, intelligent , charismatic leaders who were pragmatic instead of dogmatic . The y were nationalistic but not anti-American . If corporatocracy was buil t on three pillars — major corporations, international banks, and col- luding governments — Roldos and Torrijos held out the possibility o f removing the pillar of government collusion . A major part of the Roldos platform was what came to be known a s the Hydrocarbons Policy . This policy was based on the premise tha t Ecuador's greatest potential resource was petroleum and that al l future exploitation of that resource should be done in a manner tha t would bring the greatest benefit to the largest percentage of th e 142 \t Part III : 1975-1981 \t Ecuador ' s President Battles Big Oil \t 143"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"population . Roldos was a firm believer in the state ' s obligation t o assist the poor and disenfranchised . He expressed hope that th e Hydrocarbons Policy could in fact be used as a vehicle for bringin g about social reform . He had to walk a fine line, however, because h e knew that in Ecuador, as in so many other countries, he could not b e elected without the support of at least some of the most influentia l families, and that even if he should manage to win without them, h e would never see his programs implemented without their support . I was personally relieved that Carter was in the White Hous e during this crucial time . Despite pressures from Texaco and other oi l interests, Washington stayed pretty much out of the picture . I kne w this would not have been the case under most other administration s — Republican or Democrat . More than any other issue, I believe it was the Hydrocarbons Polic y that con v inced Ecuadorians to send Jaime Roldos to the Presidentia l Palace in Quito — their first democratically elected president after a long line of dictators . He outlined the basis of this policy in his Au - gust 10, 1979, inaugural address : We must take effective measures to defend the energ y resources of the nation . The State (must) maintain th e diversification of its exports and not lose its economi c independence . . . Our decisions will be inspired solely b y national interests and in the unrestricted defense of ou r sovereign rights . 2 Once in office, Roldos had to focus on Texaco, since by that tim e it had become the main player in the oil game . It was an extremel y rocky relationship . The oil giant did not trust the new president an d did not want to be part of any policy that would set new precedents . It was very aware that such policies might serve as models in othe r countries . A speech delivered by a key advisor to Roldos, Jose Carvajal , summed up the new administration's attitude : If a partner [Texaco] does not want to take risks, to mak e investments for exploration, or to exploit the areas of a n oil concession, the other partner has the right to mak e those investments and then to take over as the owner . . . We believe our relations with foreign companies hav e to be just ; we have to be tough in the struggle ; we have t o be prepared for all kinds of pressures, but we should no t display fear or an inferiority complex in negotiating wit h those foreigners . : 3 On New Year's Day, 1980, I made a resolution . It was the begin- ning of a new decade . In twenty-eight days, I would turn thirty-five . I resolved that during the next year I would make a major change i n my life and that in the future I would try to model myself after mod - ern heroes like Jaime Roldos and Omar Torrijos . In addition, something shocking had happened months earlier . From a profitability standpoint, Bruno had been the most successfu l president in MAIN's history . Nonetheless, suddenly and withou t warning, Mac Hall had fired him . 144 \t Part III : 1975—1981 \t Ecuador ' s President Battles Big Oil \t 145"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2 5 I Quit Mac Hall's firing of Bruno hit MAIN like an earthquake . It cause d turmoil and dissension throughout the company . Bruno had hi s share of enemies, but even some of them were dismayed . To man y employees it was obvious that the motive had been jealousy . Durin g discussions across the lunch table or around the coffee wagon, peopl e often confided that they thought Hall felt threatened by this ma n who was more than fifteen years his junior and who had taken th e firm to new levels of profitability . \"Hall couldn't allow Bruno to go on looking so good,\" one ma n said . \"Hall had to know that it was just a matter of time before Brun o would take over and the old man would be out to pasture . \" As if to prove such theories, Hall appointed Paul Priddy as th e new president . Paul had been a vice president at MAIN for years an d was an amiable, nuts-and-bolts engineer . In my opinion, he was als o lackluster, a yes-man who would bow to the chairman's whims an d would never threaten him with stellar profits . My opinion was share d by many others . For me, Bruno's departure was devastating . He had been a per- sonal mentor and a key factor in our international work . Priddy, o n the other hand, had focused on domestic jobs and knew little if any - thing about the true nature of our overseas roles . I had to questio n where the company would go from here . I called Bruno at his hom e and found him philosophical . \"Well, John, he knew he had no cause,\" he said of Hall, \"so I demanded a very good severance package, and I got it . Mac control s a huge block of voting stock, and once he made his move there wa s nothing I could do .\" Bruno indicated that he was considering severa l offers of high-level positions at multinational banks that had bee n our clients . I asked him what he thought I should do . \"Keep your eyes open,\" he advised . \"Mac Hall has lost touch wit h reality, but no one will tell him so — especially not now, after what h e did to me . \" In late March 1980, still smarting from the firing, I took a sailin g vacation in the Virgin Islands . I was joined by \"Mary,\" a young woma n who also worked for MAIN . Although I did not think about it whe n I chose the location, I now know that the region's history was a fac- tor in helping me make a decision that would start to fulfill my Ne w Year's resolution . The first inkling occurred early one afternoon a s we rounded St . John Island and tacked into Sir Francis Drake Chan- nel, which separates the American from the British Virgin Islands . The channel was named, of course, after the English scourge o f the Spanish gold fleets . That fact reminded me of the many time s during the past decade when I had thought about pirates and othe r historical figures, men like Drake and Sir Henry Morgan, who robbe d and plundered and exploited and yet were lauded—even knighte d — for their activities . I had often asked myself why, given that I ha d been raised to respect such people, I should have qualms about ex- ploiting countries like Indonesia, Panama, Colombia, and Ecuador . So many of my heroes — Ethan Allen, Thomas Jefferson, Georg e Washington, Daniel Boone, Davy Crockett, Lewis and Clark, t o name just a few — had exploited Indians, slaves, and lands that di d not belong to them, and I had drawn upon their examples to assuag e my guilt . Now, tacking up Sir Francis Drake Channel, I saw the foll y of my past rationalizations . I remembered some things I had conveniently ignored over th e years . Ethan Allen spent several months in fetid and cramped Britis h prison ships, much of the time locked into thirty pounds of iro n shackles, and then more time in an English dungeon . He was a pris- oner of war, captured at the 1775 Battle of Montreal while fightin g for the same sorts of freedom Jaime Roldos and Omar Torrijos no w sought for their people . Thomas Jefferson, George Washington, an d all the other Founding Fathers had risked their lives for similar ideals . 146 \t I Quit 147"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"Winning the revolution was no foregone conclusion ; they under - stood that if they lost, they would be hanged as traitors . Danie l Boone, Davy Crockett, and Lewis and Clark also had endured grea t hardships and made many sacrifices . And Drake and Morgan? I was a bit hazy about that period in his - tory, but I remembered that Protestant England had seen itself sorel y threatened by Catholic Spain . I had to admit to the possibility tha t Drake and Morgan had turned to piracy in order to strike at the hear t of the Spanish empire, at those gold ships, to defend the sanctity o f England, rather than out of a desire for self-aggrandizement . As we sailed up that channel, tacking back and forth into th e wind, inching closer to the mountains rising from the sea—Grea t Thatch Island to the north and St . John to the south—I could no t erase these thoughts from my mind . Mary handed me a beer an d turned up the volume on a Jimmy Buffett song . Yet, despite the beaut y that surrounded me and the sense of freedom that sailing usuall y brings, I felt angry . I tried to brush it off . I chugged down the beer . The emotion would not leave . I was angered by those voices fro m history and the way I had used them to rationalize my own greed . I was furious at my parents, and at Tilton—that self-righteous pre p school on the hill—for imposing all that history on me . I poppe d open another beer . I could have killed Mac Hall for what he ha d done to Bruno . A wooden boat with a rainbow flag sailed past us, its sails billow - ing out on both sides, downwinding through the channel . A hal f dozen young men and women shouted and waved at us, hippies i n brightly colored sarongs, one couple stark naked on the foredeck . I t was obvious from the boat itself and the look about them that the y lived aboard, a communal society, modern pirates, free, uninhibited . I tried to wave back but my hand would not obey . I felt overcom e with jealousy . Mary stood on the deck, watching them as they faded into th e distance at our stern . \"How would you like that life?\" she asked . And then I understood . It was not about my parents, Tilton, o r Mac Hall . It was my life I hated . Mine . The person responsible, th e one I loathed, was me . Mary shouted something . She was pointing over the starboar d bow She stepped closer to me . \"Leinster Bay,\" she said . \"Tonight' s anchorage .\" There it was, nestled into St . John Island, a cove where pirate ship s had lain in wait for the gold fleet when it passed through this ver y body of water . I sailed in closer, then handed the tiller over to Mar y and headed up to the foredeck . As she navigated the boat aroun d Watermelon Cay and into the beautiful bay, I lowered and bagge d the jib and hauled the anchor out of its locker . She deftly droppe d the mainsail . I nudged the anchor over the side ; the chain rattle d down into the crystal clear water and the boat drifted to a stop . After we settled in, Mary took a swim and a nap . I left her a not e and rowed the dinghy ashore, beaching it just below the ruins of a n old sugar plantation . I sat there next to the water for a long time, try - ing not to think, concentrating on emptying myself of all emotion . But it did not work . Late in the afternoon, I struggled up the steep hill and found my - self standing on the crumbling walls of this ancient plantation, look - ing down at our anchored sloop . I watched the sun sink toward th e Caribbean . It all seemed very idyllic, yet I knew that the plantatio n surrounding me had been the scene of untold misery ; hundreds o f African slaves had died here — forced at gunpoint to build the statel y mansion, to plant and harvest the cane, and to operate the equip- ment that turned raw sugar into the basic ingredient of rum . Th e tranquility of the place masked its history of brutality, even as i t masked the rage that surged within me . The sun disappeared behind a mountain-ridged island . A vas t magenta arch spread across the sky . The sea began to darken, and I came face-to-face with the shocking fact that I too had been a slaver , that my job at MAIN had not been just about using debt to dra w poor countries into the global empire . My inflated forecasts were no t merely vehicles for assuring that when my country needed oil w e could call in our pound of flesh, and my position as a partner was no t simply about enhancing the firm's profitability . My job was als o about people and their families, people akin to the ones who had die d to construct the wall I sat on, people I had exploited . For ten years, I had been the heir of those slavers who ha d marched into African jungles and hauled men and women off t o waiting ships . Mine had been a more modern approach, subtler — I never had to see the dying bodies, smell the rotting flesh, or hear th e screams of agony .

I glanced again at the sloop where it rode at anchor, strainin g against the outflowing tide . Mary was lounging on the deck, proba- bly drinking a margarita and waiting to hand one to me . In that mo- ment, seeing her there in that last light of the day, so relaxed, s o trusting, I was struck by what I was doing to her and to all the other s who worked for me, the ways I was turning them into EHMs . I wa s doing to them what Claudine had done to me, but without Claudine' s honesty . I was seducing them through raises and promotions to b e slavers, and yet they like me, were also being shackled to the system . They too were enslaved . I turned away from the sea and the bay and the magenta sky . I closed my eyes to the walls that had been built by slaves torn fro m their African homes . I tried to shut it all out . When I opened m y eyes, I was staring at a large gnarled stick, as thick as a baseball ba t and twice as long . I leaped up, grabbed the stick, and began slam - ming it against the stone walls .

Had I stayed at MAIN another few years, I might have become the forty - year-old millionaire I had once envisioned ; however, at thirty-five I had a long way to go to accomplish that objective . It was a cold an d dreary April in Boston . Then one day Paul Priddy called and pleaded with me to come t o his office . \"One of our clients is threatening to drop us,\" he said . \"The y hired us because they wanted you to represent them on the exper t witness stand . \" I thought a lot about it . By the time I sat across the desk fro m Paul, I had made my decision . I named my price — a retainer that wa s more than three times what my MAIN salary had been . To my sur - prise, he agreed, and that started me on a new career . For the next several years, I was employed as a highly paid exper t witness — primarily for U .S . electric utility companies seeking to hav e new power plants approved for construction by public utilitie s commissions . One of my clients was the Public Service Company o f New Hampshire . My job was to justify, under oath, the economi c feasibility of the highly controversial Seabrook nuclear power plant . Although I was no longer directly involved with Latin America, I continued to follow events there . As an expert witness, I had lots o f time between appearances on the stand . I kept in touch with Paul a and renewed old friendships from my Peace Corps days in Ecuado r — a country that had suddenly jumped to center stage in the worl d of international oil politics . Jaime Roldos was moving forward . He took his campaign prom- ises seriously and he was launching an all-out attack on the oil com- panies . He seemed to see clearly the things that many others on bot h sides of the Panama Canal either missed or chose to ignore . He un- derstood the underlying currents that threatened to turn the worl d into a global empire and to relegate the citizens of his country to a ver y minor role, bordering on servitude . As I read the newspaper article s about him, I was impressed not only by his commitment, but also b y his ability to perceive the deeper issues . And the deeper issues pointe d to the fact that we were entering a new epoch of world politics . In November 1980, Carter lost the U .S . presidential election t o Ronald Reagan . The Panama Canal Treaty he had negotiated wit h Torrijos, and the situation in Iran, especially the hostages held at th e U .S . Embassy and the failed rescue attempt, were major factors . However, something subtler was also happening . A president whos e greatest goal was world peace and who was dedicated to reducin g U .S . dependence on oil was replaced by a man who believed that th e United States ' rightful place was at the top of a world pyTamid hel d up by military muscle, and that controlling oil fields wherever the y existed was part of our Manifest Destiny . A president who installe d solar panels on White House roofs was replaced by one who, imme- diately upon occupying the Oval Office, had them removed . Carter may have been an ineffective politician, but he had a visio n for America that was consistent with the one defined in our Decla- ration of Independence . In retrospect, he now seems naively archaic , a throwback to the ideals that molded this nation and drew so man y of our grandparents to her shores . When we compare him to his im- mediate predecessors and successors, he is an anomaly . His world - view was inconsistent with that of the EHMs . Reagan, on the other hand, was most definitely a global empir e builder, a servant of the corporatocracy . At the time of his election , I found it fitting that he was a Hollywood actor, a man who had fol - lowed orders passed down from moguls, who knew how to take di - rection . That would be his signature . He would cater to the men wh o shuttled back and forth from corporate CEO offices to bank board s and into the halls of government . He would serve the men who ap- peared to serve him but who in fact ran the government— men lik e Vice President George H . W . Bush, Secretary of State George Shultz , Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger, Richard Cheney ; Richar d Helms, and Robert McNamara . He would advocate what those me n wanted : an America that controlled the world and all its resources , a world that answered to the commands of that America, a U .S . mil- itary that would enforce the rules as they were written by America , and an international trade and banking system that supporte d America as CEO of the global empire . As I looked into the future, it seemed we were entering a perio d that would be very good to the EHMs . It was another twist of fat e that I had chosen this moment in history to drop out . The more I re- flected on it, however, the better I felt about it . I knew that my timin g was right . As for what this meant in the long term, I had no crystal ball ; however, I knew from history that empires do not endure and that th e pendulum always swings in both directions . From my perspective , 154 \t Part IV : 1981—Present \t Ecuador ' s Presidential Death \t 155"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"men like Roldos offered hope . I was certain that Ecuador's new pres - ident understood many of the subtleties of the current situation . I knew that he had been a Torrijos admirer and had applauded Carte r for his courageous stand on the Panama Canal issue . I felt certai n that Roldos would not falter . I could only hope that his fortitud e would light a candle for the leaders of other countries, who neede d the type of inspiration he and Torrijos could provide . Early in 1981, the Roldos administration formally presented hi s new hydrocarbons law to the Ecuadorian Congress . If implemented , it would reform the country's relationship to oil companies . By man y standards, it was considered revolutionary and even radical . It cer- tainly aimed to change the way business was conducted . Its influ- ence would stretch far beyond Ecuador, into much of Latin Americ a and throughout the world . l The oil companies reacted predictably—they pulled out all th e stops . Their public relations people went to work to vilify Jaim e Roldos, and their lobbyists swept into Quito and Washington, brief - cases full of threats and payoffs . They tried to paint the first demo- cratically elected president of Ecuador in modern times as anothe r Castro . But Roldos would not cave in to intimidation . He responde d by denouncing the conspiracy between politics and oil — and religion . He openly accused the Summer Institute of Linguistics of colludin g with the oil companies and then, in an extremely bold—perhap s reckless — move, he ordered SIL out of the country . 2 Only weeks after sending his legislative package to Congress an d a couple of days after expelling the SIL missionaries, Roldos warne d all foreign interests, including but not limited to oil companies, tha t unless they implemented plans that would help Ecuador's people , they would be forced to leave his country . He delivered a majo r speech at the Atahualpa Olympic Stadium in Quito and then heade d off to a small community in southern Ecuador . He died there in a fiery airplane crash, on May 24, 1981 . 3 The world was shocked . Latin Americans were outraged . News - papers throughout the hemisphere blazed, \"CIA Assassination!\" I n addition to the fact that Washington and the oil companies hate d him, many circumstances appeared to support these allegations, an d such suspicions were heightened as more facts became known . Nothing was ever proven, but eyewitnesses claimed that Roldos , forewarned about an attempt on his life, had taken precautions, including traveling in two airplanes . At the last moment, it was said , one of his security officers had convinced him to board the decoy air - plane . It had blown up . Despite world reaction, the news hardly made the U .S . press . Osvaldo Hurtado took over as Ecuador's president . He reinstate d the Summer Institute of Linguistics and their oil company sponsors . By the end of the year, he had launched an ambitious program to in - crease oil drilling by Texaco and other foreign companies in the Gul f of Guayaquil and the Amazon basin . 4 Omar Torrijos, in eulogizing Roldos, referred to him as \"brother . \" He also confessed to having nightmares about his own assassina- tion ; he saw himself dropping from the sky in a gigantic fireball .

I was anything but naive . I knew about Arbenz, Mossadegh, Allend e — and about many other people whose names never made the news - papers or history books but whose lives were destroyed and sometime s cut short because they stood up to the corporatocracy . Nevertheless , I was shocked . It was just so very blatant . I had concluded, after our phenomenal success in Saudi Arabia , that such wantonly overt actions were things of the past . I though t the jackals had been relegated to zoos . Now I saw that I was wrong . I had no doubt that Roldos's death had not been an accident . It ha d all the markings of a CIA-orchestrated assassination . I understoo d that it had been executed so blatantly in order to send a message . The new Reagan administration, complete with its fast-draw Holly - wood cowboy image, was the ideal vehicle for delivering such a mes - sage . The jackals were back, and they wanted Omar Torrijos an d everyone else who might consider joining an anti-corporatocrac y crusade to know it . But Torrijos was not buckling . Like Roldos, he refused to be in- timidated . He, too, expelled the Summer Institute of Linguistics, an d he adamantly refused to give in to the Reagan administration's de- mands to renegotiate the Canal Treaty . Two months after Roldos's death, Omar Torrijos's nightmar e came true ; he died in a plane crash . It was July 31, 1981 . Latin America and the world reeled . Torrijos was known acros s the globe ; he was respected as the man who had forced the Unite d States to relinquish the Panama Canal to its rightful owners, an d who continued to stand up to Ronald Reagan . He was a champion o f human rights, the head of state who had opened his arms to refugee s across the political spectrum, including the shah of Iran, a charismati c voice for social justice who, many believed, would be nominated fo r the Nobel Peace Prize . Now he was dead . \"CIA Assassination!\" onc e again headlined articles and editorials . Graham Greene began his book Getting to Know the General, th e one that grew out of the trip when I met him at the Hotel Panama , with the following paragraph : In August 1981, my bag was packed for my fifth visit t o Panama when the news came to me over the telephone o f the death of General Omar Torrijos Herrera, my frien d and host . The small plane in which he was flying to a house which he owned at Coclesito in the mountains o f Panama had crashed, and there were no survivors . A fe w days later the voice of his security guard, Sergeant Chuchu , alias Jose de Jesus Martinez, ex-professor of Marxist phi- losophy at Panama University, professor of mathematic s and a poet, told me, \"There was a bomb in that plane . I know there was a bomb in the plane, but I can't tell yo u why over the telephone .\" 1 People everywhere mourned the death of this man who ha d earned a reputation as defender of the poor and defenseless, an d they clamored for Washington to open investigations into CIA ac- tivities . However, this was not about to happen . There were me n who hated Torrijos, and the list included people with immense power . Before his death, he was openly loathed by President Reagan, Vic e President Bush, Secretary of Defense Weinberger, and the Join t Chiefs of Staff, as well as by the CEOs of many powerful corporations . The military chiefs were especially incensed by provisions in th e Torrijos-Carter Treaty that forced them to close the School of th e Americas and the U .S . Southern Command's tropical warfare center . The chiefs thus had a serious problem . Either they had to figure ou t 158 \t Panama : Another Presidential Death 159"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"some way to get around the new treaty ; or they needed to find an - other country that would be willing to harbor these facilities — a n unlikely prospect in the closing decades of the twentieth century . O f course, there was also another option : dispose of Torrijos and rene- gotiate the treaty with his successor . Among Torrijos's corporate enemies were the huge multinationals . Most had close ties to U .S . politicians and were involved in exploit- ing Latin American labor forces and natural resources — oil, lumber , tin, copper, bauxite, and agricultural lands . They included manu- facturing firms, communications companies, shipping and trans- portation conglomerates, and engineering and other technologicall y oriented corporations . The Bechtel Group, Inc . was a prime example of the cozy relation - ship between private companies and the U .S . government . I kne w Bechtel well ; we at MAIN often worked closely with the company , and its chief architect became a close personal friend . Bechtel was th e United States' most influential engineering and construction company . Its president and senior officers included George Shultz and Caspa r Weinberger, who despised Torrijos because he brazenly courted a Japanese plan to replace Panama's existing canal with a new, mor e efficient one . 2 Such a move not only would transfer ownership fro m the United States to Panama but also would exclude Bechtel fro m participating in the most exciting and potentially lucrative engi- neering project of the century . Torrijos stood up to these men, and he did so with grace, charm , and a wonderful sense of humor . Now he was dead, and he had bee n replaced by a protege, Manuel Noriega, a man who lacked Torrijos' s wit, charisma, and intelligence, and a man who many suspected ha d no chance against the Reagans, Bushes, and Bechtels of the world . I was personally devastated by the tragedy . I spent many hour s reflecting on my conversations with Torrijos . Late one night, I sat fo r a long time staring at his photo in a magazine and recalling my firs t night in Panama, riding in a cab through the rain, stopping befor e his gigantic billboard picture . \"Omar's ideal is freedom ; the missil e is not invented that can kill an ideal!\" The memory of that inscrip- tion sent a shudder through me, even as it had on that stormy night . I could not have known back then that Torrijos would collaborat e with Carter to return the Panama Canal to the people who rightfull y deserved to own it, or that this victory, along with his attempts t o 160 \t Part IV : 1981—Present reconcile differences between Latin American Socialists and the dic - tators, would so infuriate the Reagan-Bush administration that i t would seek to assassinate him . 3 I could not have known that on an - other dark night he would be killed during a routine flight in hi s Twin Otter, or that most of the world outside the United States woul d have no doubt that Torrijos's death at the age of fifty-two was jus t one more in a series of CIA assassinations . Had Torrijos lived, he undoubtedly would have sought to quel l the growing violence that has plagued so many Central and Sout h American nations . Based on his record, we can assume that he woul d have tried to work out an arrangement to mitigate international oi l company destruction of the Amazon regions of Ecuador, Colombia , and Peru . One result of such action would be the alleviation of th e terrible conflicts that Washington refers to as terrorist and dru g wars, but which Torrijos would have seen as actions taken by des- perate people to protect their families and homes . Most importantly , I feel certain that he would have served as a role model for a ne w generation of leaders in the Americas, Africa, and Asia — somethin g the CIA, the NSA, and the EHMs could not allow .

Bus h At the time of Torrijos's death, I had not seen Paula for severa l months . I was dating other women, including Winifred Grant, a young environmental planner I had met at MAIN, and whose fathe r happened to be chief architect at Bechtel . Paula was dating a Colom - bian journalist . We remained friends but agreed to sever our ro- mantic ties . I struggled with my job as an expert witness, particularly in justi - fying the Seabrook nuclear power plant . It often seemed as though I had sold out again, slipping back into an old role simply for the sak e of money . Winifred was an immense help to me during this period . She was an avowed environmentalist, yet she understood the prac- tical necessities of providing ever-increasing amounts of electricity . She had grown up in the Berkeley area of San Francisco's East Ba y and had graduated from UC Berkeley . She was a freethinker whos e views on life contrasted with those of my puritanical parents an d of Ann . Our relationship developed . Winifred took a leave of absenc e from MAIN, and together we sailed my boat down the Atlantic coas t toward Florida . We took our time, frequently leaving the boat in dif - ferent ports so I could fly off to provide expert witness testimony . Eventually, we sailed into West Palm Beach, Florida, and rented a n apartment . We married, and our daughter, Jessica, was born on Ma y 17, 1982 . I was thirty-six, considerably older than all the other me n who hung out in Lamaze class . Part of my job on the Seabrook case was to convince the Ne w Hampshire Public Service Commission that nuclear power was th e best and most economical choice for generating electricity in the state . Unfortunately, the longer I studied the issue, the more I began t o doubt the validity of my own arguments . The literature was constantl y changing at that time, reflecting a growth in research, and the evi- dence increasingly indicated that many alternative forms of energ y were technically superior and more economical than nuclear power . The balance also was beginning to shift away from the old theor y that nuclear power was safe . Serious questions were being raise d about the integrity of backup systems, the training of operators, th e human tendency to make mistakes, equipment fatigue, and the in - adequacy of nuclear waste disposal . I personally became uncom- fortable with the position I was expected to take —was paid to tak e — under oath in what amounted to a court of law . At the same time , I was becoming convinced that some of the emerging technologie s offered electricity-generating methods that could actually help th e environment . This was particularly true in the area of generatin g electricity from substances previously considered waste products . One day I informed my bosses at the New Hampshire utility com - pany that I could no longer testify on their behalf . I gave up this ver y lucrative career and decided to create a company that would mov e some of the new technologies off the drawing boards and put th e theories into practice . Winifred supported me one hundred percent , despite the uncertainties of the venture and the fact that, for the firs t time in her life, she was now starting a family . Several months after Jessica's birth in 1982, I founded Indepen- dent Power Systems (IPS), a company whose mission included devel - oping environmentally beneficial power plants and establishin g models to inspire others to do likewise . It was a high-risk business , and most of our competitors eventually failed . However, \"coinci- dences\" came to our rescue . In fact, I was certain that many time s someone stepped in to help, that I was being rewarded for my pas t service and for my commitment to silence . Bruno Zambotti had accepted a high-level position at the Inter - American Development Bank . He agreed to serve on the IPS boar d and to help finance the fledgling company . We received backing fro m Bankers Trust ; ESI Energy ; Prudential Insurance Company ; Chad - bourne and Parke (a major Wall Street law firm, in which forme r 162 \t My Energy Company, Enron, and George W . Bush 163"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"U .S . senator, presidential candidate, and secretary of state E d Muskie, was a partner) ; and Riley Stoker Corporation (an engineer- ing firm, owned by Ashland Oil Company, which designed and buil t highly sophisticated and innovative power plant boilers) . We eve n had backing from the U .S . Congress, which singled out IPS for ex- emption from a specific tax, and in the process gave us a distinct ad - vantage over our competitors . In 1986, IPS and Bechtel simultaneously — but independently o f each other — began construction of power plants that used highly in- novative, state-of-the-art technologies for burning waste coal with - out producing acid rain . By the end of the decade these two plant s had revolutionized the utility industry, directly contributing to ne w national antipollution laws by proving once and for all that many so - called waste products actually can be converted into electricity, an d that coal can be burned without creating acid rain, thereby dispellin g long-standing utility company claims to the contrary . Our plant als o established that such unproven, state-of-the-art technologies coul d be financed by a small independent company, through Wall Stree t and other conventional means .' As an added benefit, the IPS powe r plant sent vented heat to a three and one-half-acre hydroponi c greenhouse, rather than into cooling ponds or cooling towers . My role as IPS president gave me an inside track on the energ y industry . I dealt with some of the most influential people in the busi - ness : lawyers, lobbyists, investment bankers, and high-level execu- tives at the major firms . I also had the advantage of a father-in-la w who had spent over thirty years at Bechtel, had risen to the positio n of chief architect, and now was in charge of building a city in Saud i Arabia — a direct result of the work I had done in the early 1970s , during the Saudi Arabian Money-laundering Affair . Winifred gre w up near Bechtel's San Francisco world headquarters and was also a member of the corporate family ; her first job after graduating fro m UC Berkeley was at Bechtel . The energy industry was undergoing major restructuring . The bi g engineering firms were jockeying to take over — or at least to compet e with —the utility companies that previously had enjoyed the privi- leges of local monopolies . Deregulation was the watchword of the day , and rules changed overnight . Opportunities abounded for ambitiou s people to take advantage of a situation that baled the courts and Con - gress . Industry pundits dubbed it the \"Wild West of Energy\" era . One casualty of this process was MAIN . As Bruno predicted, Ma c Hall had lost touch with reality and no one dared tell him so . Pau l Priddy never asserted control, and MAIN's management not onl y failed to take advantage of the changes sweeping the industry bu t also made a series of fatal mistakes . Only a few years after Bruno de - livered record profits, MAIN dropped its EHM role and was in dir e financial straits . The partners sold MAIN to one of the large engi- neering and construction firms that had played its cards right . While I had received almost thirty dollars a share for my stock i n 1980, the remaining partners settled for less than half that amount , approximately four years later . Thus did one hundred years of prou d service end in humiliation . I was sad to see the company fold, but I felt vindicated that I had gotten out when I did . The MAIN nam e continued under the new ownership for a while, but then it wa s dropped . The logo that had once carried such weight in countrie s around the globe fell into oblivion . MAIN was one example of a company that did not cope well i n the changing atmosphere of the energy industry . At the opposite en d of the spectrum was a company we insiders found fascinating : Enron . One of the fastest-growing organizations in the business, it seeme d to come out of nowhere and immediately began putting togethe r mammoth deals . Most business meetings open with a few moment s of idle chatter while the participants settle into their seats, pou r themselves cups of coffee, and arrange their papers ; in those day s the idle chatter often centered on Enron . No one outside the compan y could fathom how Enron was able to accomplish such miracles . Those on the inside simply smiled at the rest of us, and kept quiet . Occasionally, when pressed, they talked about new approaches t o management, about \"creative financing,\" and about their commit- ment to hiring executives who knew their way through the corridor s of power in capitals across the globe . To me, this all sounded like a new version of old EHM tech- niques . The global empire was marching forward at a rapid pace . For those of us interested in oil and the international scene, ther e was another frequently discussed topic : the vice president's son , George W . Bush . His first energy company, Arbusto (Spanish fo r bush) was a failure that ultimately was rescued through a 198 4 merger with Spectrum 7 . Then Spectrum 7 found itself poised at th e brink of bankruptcy, and was purchased, in 1986, by Harken Energ y 164 Part IV : 1981-Present \t My Energy Company, Enron, and George W Bush 165"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"Corporation ; G . W . Bush was retained as a board member and con- sultant with an annual salary of $120,000 . 2 We all assumed that having a father who was the U .S . vice presi - dent factored into this hiring decision, since the younger Bush' s record of accomplishment as an oil executive certainly did not war - rant it . It also seemed no coincidence that Harken took this oppor- tunity to branch out into the international field for the first time i n its corporate history, and to begin actively searching for oil invest- ments in the Middle East . Vanity Fair magazine reported, \"Onc e Bush took his seat on the board, wonderful things started to happe n to Harken — new in v estments, unexpected sources of financing , serendipitous drilling rights .\" 3 In 1989, Amoco was negotiating with the government of Bahrai n for offshore drilling rights . Then Vice President Bush was electe d president . Shortly thereafter, Michael Ameen — a State Departmen t consultant assigned to brief the newly confirmed U .S . ambassador t o Bahrain, Charles Hostler — arranged for meetings between th e Bahraini government and Harken Energy . Suddenly, Amoco wa s replaced by Harken . Although Harken had not previously drilled out - side the southeastern United States, and never offshore, it won exclu - sive drilling rights in Bahrain, something previously unheard of in th e Arab world . Within a few weeks, the price of Harken Energy stoc k increased by over twenty percent, from $4 .50 to $5 .50 per share . 4 Even seasoned energy people were shocked by what had hap- pened in Bahrain . \"I hope G . W . isn't up to something his father wil l pay for,\" said a lawyer friend of mine who specialized in the energ y industry and also was a major supporter of the Republican Party . W e were enjoying cocktails at a bar around the corner from Wal l Street, high atop the World Trade Center . He expressed dismay . \" I wonder if it's really worth it,\" he continued, shaking his head sadly . \"Is the son's career worth risking the presidency? \" I was less surprised than my peers, but I suppose I had a uniqu e perspective . I had worked for the governments of Kuwait, Saud i Arabia, Egypt, and Iran, I was familiar with Middle Eastern politics , and I knew that Bush, just like the Enron executives, was part of th e network I and my EHM colleagues had created ; they were the feuda l lords and plantation masters . 5 CHAPTER 2 9 I Take a Brib e During this time in my life, I came to realize that we truly had en- tered a new era in world economics . Events set in motion whil e Robert McNamara—the man who had served as one of my model s — reigned as secretary of defense and president of the World Ban k had escalated beyond my gravest fears . McNamara's Keynesian - inspired approach to economics, and his advocacy of aggressiv e leadership, had become pervasive . The EHM concept had expande d to include all manner of executives in a wide variety of businesses . They may not have been recruited or profiled by the NSA, but the y were performing similar functions . The only difference now was that the corporate executive EHM s did not necessarily involve themselves with the use of funds from th e international banking community . While the old branch, my branch , continued to thrive, the new version took on aspects that were eve n more sinister . During the 1980s, young men and women rose u p through the ranks of middle management believing that any mean s justified the end : an enhanced bottom line . Global empire was sim- ply a pathway to increased profits . The new trends were typified by the energy industry, where I worked . The Public Utility Regulatory Policy Act (PURPA) wa s passed by Congress in 1978, went through a series of legal challenges , and finally became law in 1982 . Congress originally envisioned th e law as a way to encourage small, independent companies like min e to develop alternative fuels and other innovative approaches t o 166 \t Part IV : 1981-Present \t 167"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"producing electricity . Under this law, the major utility companie s were required to purchase energy generated by the smaller compa- nies, at fair and reasonable prices . This policy was a result of Carte r ' s desire to reduce U .S . dependence on oil — all oil, not just importe d oil . The intent of the law was clearly to encourage both alternativ e energy sources and the development of independent companies tha t reflected America's entrepreneurial spirit . However, the reality turne d out to be something very different . During the 1980s and into the 1990s, the emphasis switche d from entrepreneurship to deregulation . I watched as most of the othe r small independents were swallowed up by the large engineering an d construction firms, and by the public utility companies themselves . The latter found legal loopholes that allowed them to create holdin g companies, which could own both the regulated utility companie s and the unregulated independent energy-producing corporations . Many of them launched aggressive programs to drive the independ- ents into bankruptcy and then purchase them . Others simply starte d from scratch and developed their own equivalent of the independents . The idea of reducing our oil dependence fell by the wayside . Rea - gan was deeply indebted to the oil companies ; Bush had made hi s own fortune as an oilman . And most of the key players and cabine t members in these two administrations were either part of the oil in- dustry or were part of the engineering and construction companie s so closely tied to it . Moreover, in the final analysis, oil and construc - tion were not partisan ; many Democrats had profited from and wer e beholden to them also . IPS continued to maintain a vision of e n v ironmentally beneficia l energy . We were committed to the original PURPA goals, and w e seemed to lead a charmed life . We were one of the few independent s that not only survived but also thrived . I have no doubt that the rea- son for this was because of my past services to the corporatocracy . What was going on in the energy field was symbolic of a tren d that was affecting the whole world . Concerns about social welfare , the environment, and other quality-of-life issues took a backseat t o greed . In the process, an overwhelming emphasis was placed on pro - moting private businesses . At first, this was justified on theoretica l bases, including the idea that capitalism was superior to and woul d deter communism . Eventually, however, such justification was un - needed . It was simply accepted a priori that there was something inherently better about projects owned by wealthy investors rathe r than by governments . International organizations such as the Worl d Bank bought into this notion, advocating deregulation and privati- zation of water and sewer systems, communications networks, utilit y grids, and other facilities that up until then had been managed b y governments . As a result, it was easy to expand the EHM concept into the large r community, to send executives from a broad spectrum of businesse s on missions previously reserved for the few of us recruited into a n exclusive club . These executives fanned out across the planet . The y sought the cheapest labor pools, the most accessible resources, an d the largest markets . They were ruthless in their approach . Lik e the EHMs who had gone before them—like me, in Indonesia, i n Panama, and in Colombia—they found ways to rationalize thei r misdeeds . And like us, they ensnared communities and countries . They promised affluence, a way for countries to use the private sec - tor to dig themselves out of debt . They built schools and highways , donated telephones, televisions, and medical services . In the end , however, if they found cheaper workers or more accessible resource s elsewhere, they left . When they abandoned a community whos e hopes they had raised, the consequences were often devastating, bu t they apparently did this without a moment's hesitation or a nod t o their own consciences . I had to wonder, though, what all this was doing to their psyches , whether they had their moments of doubt, as I had had mine . Di d they ever stand next to a befouled canal and watch a young woma n try to bathe while an old man defecated upriver? Were there n o Howard Parkers left to ask the tough questions ? Although I enjoyed my IPS successes and my life as a family man , I could not fight my moments of severe depression . I was now the fa - ther of a young girl, and I feared for the future she would inherit . I was weighed down with guilt for the part I had played . I also could look back and see a very disturbing historical trend . The modern international financial system was created near the en d of World War II, at a meeting of leaders from many countries, hel d in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire — my home state . The Worl d Bank and the International Monetary Fund were formed in order t o reconstruct a devastated Europe, and they achieved remarkable suc - cess . The system expanded rapidly, and it was soon sanctioned b y 168 \t Part IV : 1981—Present \t I Take a Bribe \t 169"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"every major U .S . ally and hailed as a panacea for oppression . It would , we were assured, save us all from the evil clutches of communism . But I could not help wondering where all this would lead us . B y the late 1980s, with the collapse of the Soviet Union and the worl d Communist movement, it became apparent that deterring commu- nism was not the goal ; it was equally obvious that the global em- pire, which was rooted in capitalism, would have free reign . As Ji m Garrison, president of the State of the World forum, observes : Taken cumulatively, the integration of the world as a whole , particularly in terms of economic globalization and th e mythic qualities of \"free market\" capitalism, represents a veritable \"empire\" in its own right . . . No nation on eart h has been able to resist the compelling magnetism of glob- alization . Few have been able to escape the \"structura l adjustments\" and \"conditionalities\" of the World Bank , the International Monetary Fund, or the arbitrations o f the World Trade Organization, those international finan- cial institutions that, however inadequate, still determin e what economic globalization means, what the rules are , and who is rewarded for submission and punished fo r infractions . Such is the power of globalization that withi n our lifetime we are likely to see the integration, even i f unevenly, of all national economies in the world into a single global, free market system . ' As I mulled over these issues, I decided it was time to write a tell - all book, Conscience of an Economic Hit Man, but I made no attemp t to keep the work quiet . Even today, I am not the sort of writer wh o writes in isolation . I find it necessary to discuss the work I am doing . I receive inspiration from other people, and I call upon them to hel p me remember and put into perspective events of the past . I like t o read sections of the materials I am working on to friends, so I ma y hear their reactions . I understand that this may be risky, yet I kno w no other way for me to write . Thus, it was no secret that I was writ- ing a book about my time with MAIN . One afternoon in 1987, another former MAIN partner contacte d me and offered me an extremely lucrative consulting contract wit h Stone & Webster Engineering Corporation (SWEC) . At that time, SWEC was one of the world ' s premier engineering and constructio n companies, and it was trying to forge a place for itself in the chang- ing environment of the energy industry . My contact explained tha t I would report to their new subsidiary, an independent energy - development branch modeled after companies like my own IPS . I was relieved to learn that I would not be asked to get involved in an y international or EHM-type projects . In fact, he told me, I would not be expected to do very much at all . I was one of the few people who had founded and managed a success - ful independent energy company, and I had an excellent reputatio n in the industry . SWEC's primary interest was to use my resume an d to include me on its list of advisers, which was legal and was consisten t with standard industry practices . The offer was especially attractiv e to me because, due to a number of circumstances, I was considerin g selling IPS . The idea of joining the SWEC stable and receiving a spectacular retainer was welcome . The day he hired me, the CEO of SWEC took me out to a privat e lunch . We chatted informally for some time, and as we did so I real- ized that a side of me was eager to get back into the consulting busi- ness, to leave behind the responsibilities of running a complicate d energy company, of being responsible for over a hundred peopl e when we were constructing a facility, and of dealing with all the lia- bilities associated with building and operating power plants . I ha d already envisioned how I would spend the substantial retainer I knew he was about to offer me . I had decided to use it, among othe r things, to create a nonprofit organization . Over dessert, my host brought up the subject of the one book I had already published, The Stress-Free Habit . He told me he had hear d wonderful things about it . Then he looked me squarely in the eye . \"Do you intend to write any more books?\" he asked . My stomach tightened . Suddenly, I understood what this was al l about . I did not hesitate . \"No,\" I said . \"I don't intend to try to publis h any more books at this time . \" \"I'm glad to hear that,\" he said . \"We value our privacy at this com - pany . Just like at MAIN . \" \"I understand that . \" He sat back and, smiling, seemed to relax . \"Of course, books lik e your last one, about dealing with stress and such things, are perfectl y acceptable . Sometimes they can even further a man's career . As a 170 \t Part IV : 1981—Present \t I Take a Bribe 171"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"consultant to SWEC, you are perfectly free to publish that sort o f thing .\" He looked at me as though expecting a response . \" That ' s good to know . \" \"Yes, perfectly acceptable . However, it goes without saying tha t you'll never mention the name of this company in your books, an d that you will not write about anything that touches on the nature o f our business here or the work you did at MAIN . You will not mentio n political subjects or any dealings with international banks and devel - opment projects .\" He peered at me . \"Simply a matter of confidentiality \" \"It goes without saying,\" I assured him . For an instant, my hear t seemed to stop beating . An old feeling returned, similar to ones I had experienced around Howard Parker in Indonesia, while drivin g through Panama City beside Fidel, and while sitting in a Colombia n coffee shop with Paula . I was selling out—again . This was not a bribe in the legal sense — it was perfectly aboveboard and legitimat e for this company to pay to include my name on their roster, to cal l upon me for advice or to show up at a meeting from time to time , but I understood the real reason I was being hired . He offered me an annual retainer that was equivalent to an exec- utive's salary . Later that afternoon I sat in an airport, stunned, waiting for m y flight back to Florida . I felt like a prostitute . Worse than that, I fel t I had betrayed my daughter, my family, and my country . And yet, I told myself, I had little choice . I knew that if I had not accepted thi s bribe, the threats would have followed . CHAPTER 3 0 The United States Invades Panam a Torrijos was dead, but Panama continued to hold a special place i n my heart . Living in South Florida, I had access to many sources o f information about current events in Central America . Torrijos' s legacy lived on, even if it was filtered through people who were no t graced with his compassionate personality and strength of character . Attempts to settle differences throughout the hemisphere continue d after his death, as did Panama's determination to force the Unite d States to live up to the terms of the Canal Treaty . Torrijos's successor, Manuel Noriega, at first appeared committe d to following in his mentor's footsteps . I never met Noriega person - ally, but by all accounts, he initially endeavored to further the caus e of Latin America's poor and oppressed . One of his most importan t projects was the continued exploration of prospects for building a new canal, to be financed and constructed by the Japanese . Pre- dictably, he encountered a great deal of resistance from Washingto n and from private U .S . companies . As Noriega himself writes : Secretary of State George Shultz was a former executiv e of the multinational construction company Bechtel ; Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger had been a Bechte l vice president . Bechtel would have liked nothing bette r than to earn the billions of dollars in revenue that cana l construction would generate . . . The Reagan and Bus h administrations feared the possibility that Japan migh t 172 \t Part IV : 1981—Present \t 173"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"dominate an eventual canal construction project ; no t only was there a misplaced concern about security, ther e was also the question of commercial rivalry . U .S . con- struction firms stood to lose billions of dollars . l But Noriega was no Torrijos . He did not have his former boss' s charisma or integrity . Over time, he developed an unsavory reputa- tion for corruption and drug dealing, and was even suspected of ar- ranging the assassination of a political rival, Hugo Spadafora . Noriega built his reputation as a colonel heading up the Pana- manian Defense Forces' G-2 unit, the military intelligence comman d that was the national liaison with the CIA . In this capacity, he de- veloped a close relationship with CIA Director William J . Casey . Th e CIA used this connection to further its agenda throughout the Carib - bean and Central and South America . For example, when the Reaga n administration wanted to give Castro advance warning of the 198 3 U .S . invasion of Grenada, Casey turned to Noriega, asking him t o serve as messenger . The colonel also helped the CIA infiltrate Colom - bian and other drug cartels . By 1984, Noriega had been promoted to general and commande r in chief of the Panamanian Defense Forces . It is reported that whe n Casey arrived in Panama City that year and was met at the airport b y the local CIA chief, he asked, \"Where's my boy? Where's Noriega? \" When the general visited Washington, the two men met privately a t Casey's house . Many years later, Noriega would admit that his clos e bond with Casey made him feel invincible . He believed that the CIA , like G-2, was the strongest branch of its country's government . H e was convinced that Casey would protect him, despite Noriega's stanc e on the Panama Canal Treaty and U .S . Canal Zone military bases . 2 Thus, while Torrijos had been an international icon for justic e and equality, Noriega became a symbol of corruption and decadence . His notoriety in this regard was assured when, on June 12, 1986, th e New York Times ran a front-page article with the headline, \"Panam a Strongman Said to Trade in Drugs and Illicit Money .\" The expose , wTitten by a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter, alleged that the genera l was a secret and illegal partner in several Latin American busi- nesses ; that he had spied on and for both the United States and Cuba , acting as a sort of double agent ; that G-2, under his orders, had in fact beheaded Hugo Spadafora ; and that Noriega had personall y directed \" the most significant drug running in Panama .\" This articl e was accompanied by an unflattering portrait of the general, and a follow-up the next day included more details . 3 Compounding his other problems, Noriega was also saddle d with a U .S . president who suffered from an image problem, wha t journalists referred to as George H . W . Bush's \"wimp factor .\" 4 Thi s took on special significance when Noriega adamantly refused t o consider a fifteen-year extension for the School of the Americas . Th e general's memoirs provide an interesting insight : As determined and proud as we were to follow throug h with Torrijos's legacy, the United States didn't want an y of this to happen . They wanted an extension or a renego- tiation for the installation [School of the Americas] , saying that with their growing war preparations in Cen- tral America, they still needed it . But that School of th e Americas was an embarrassment to us . We didn't want a training ground for death squads and repressive right - wing militaries on our soil . 5 Perhaps, therefore, the world should have anticipated it, but i n fact the world was stunned when, on December 20, 1989, the Unite d States attacked Panama with what was reported to be the largest air - borne assault on a city since World War II . 6 It was an unprovoke d attack on a civilian population . Panama and her people posed ab- solutely no threat to the United States or to any other country . Politi- cians, governments, and press around the world denounced th e unilateral U .S . action as a clear violation of international law . Had this military operation been directed against a country tha t had committed mass murder or other human rights crimes — Pino- chet's Chile, Stroessner's Paraguay, Somosa's Nicaragua, D'Aubuisson' s El Salvador, or Saddam's Iraq, for example—the world might hav e understood . But Panama had done nothing of the sort ; it had merel y dared to defy the wishes of a handful of powerful politicians and cor - porate executives . It had insisted that the Canal Treaty be honored , it had held discussions with social reformers, and it had explore d the possibility of building a new canal with Japanese financing an d 174 Part Iv : 198I-Present \t The United States Invades Panama 175"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"construction companies . As a result, it suffered devastating conse- quences . As Noriega puts it : favorable to the United States, was to frighten countries like Iraq int o submission . David Harris, a contributing editor at the New York Times Mag- azine and the author of many books, has an interesting observation . In his 2001 book Shooting the Moon, he states : I want to make it very clear : the destabilization campaig n launched by the United States in 1986, ending with th e 1989 Panama invasion, was a result of the U .S . rejectio n of any scenario in which future control of the Panam a Canal might be in the hands of an independent, sover- eign Panama— supported by Japan . . . Shultz and Wein- berger, meanwhile, masquerading as officials operatin g in the public interest and basking in popular ignoranc e about the powerful economic interests they represented , were building a propaganda campaign to shoot m e down . 7 Washington's stated justification for the attack was based on on e man . The United States' sole rationale for sending its young me n and women to risk their lives and consciences killing innocent peo - ple, including untold numbers of children, and setting fire to hug e sections of Panama City, was Noriega . He was characterized as evil , as the enemy of the people, as a drug-trafficking monster, and a s such he provided the administration with an excuse for the massiv e invasion of a country with two million inhabitants — which coinci- dentally happened to sit on one of the most valuable pieces of rea l estate in the world . I found the invasion disturbing to the point of driving me into a depression that lasted many days . I knew that Noriega had body - guards, yet I could not help believing that the jackals could hav e taken him out, as they had Roldos and Torrijos . Most of his body - guards, I suspected, had been trained by U .S . military personnel an d probably could have been paid either to look the other way or t o carry out an assassination themselves . The more I thought and read about the invasion, therefore, th e more convinced I became that it signaled a U .S . policy turn bac k toward the old methods of empire building, that the Bush adminis- tration was determined to go one better than Reagan and to demon - strate to the world that it would not hesitate to use massive force i n order to achieve its ends . It also seemed that the goal in Panama, i n addition to replacing the Torrijos legacy with a puppet administration Of all the thousands of rulers, potentates, strongmen , juntas, and warlords the Americans have dealt with in al l corners of the world, General Manuel Antonio Noriega i s the only one the Americans came after like this . Just onc e in its 225 years of formal national existence has th e United States ever invaded another country and carrie d its ruler back to the United States to face trial and im- prisonment for violations of American law committed o n that ruler's own native foreign turf . 8 Following the bombardment, the United States suddenly foun d itself in a delicate situation . For a while, it seemed as though th e whole thing would backfire . The Bush administration might hav e quashed the wimp rumors, but now it faced the problem of legiti- macy, of appearing to be a bully caught in an act of terrorism . It wa s disclosed that the U .S . Army had prohibited the press, the Red Cross , and other outside observers from entering the heavily bombed area s for three days, while soldiers incinerated and buried the casualties . The press asked questions about how much evidence of criminal an d other inappropriate behavior was destroyed, and about how man y died because they were denied timely medical attention, but suc h questions were never answered . We shall never know many of the facts about the invasion, no r shall we know the true extent of the massacre . Defense Secretar y Richard Cheney claimed a death toll between five hundred and si x hundred, but independent human rights groups estimated it at thre e thousand to five thousand, with another twenty-five thousand lef t homeless . 9 Noriega was arrested, flown to Miami, and sentenced t o forty years' imprisonment ; at that time, he was the only person i n the United States officially classified as a prisoner of war .' 0 The world was outraged by this breach of international law an d by the needless destruction of a defenseless people at the hands o f the most powerful military force on the planet, but few in the Unite d 176 Part IV : 1981-Present \t The United States Invades Panama 177"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"States were aware of either the outrage or the crimes Washingto n had committed . Press coverage was very limited . A number of fac- tors contributed to this, including government policy, White Hous e phone calls to publishers and television executives, congresspeopl e who dared not object, lest the wimp factor become their problem , and journalists who thought the public needed heroes rather tha n objectivity . One exception was Peter Eisner, a Newsday editor and Associate d Press reporter who covered the Panama invasion and continued t o analyze it for many years . In The Memoirs ofManuel Noriega : Amer- ica's Prisoner, published in 1997, Eisner writes : The death, destruction and injustice wrought in th e name of fighting Noriega —and the lies surrounding tha t event —were threats to the basic American principles o f democracy . . . Soldiers were ordered to kill in Panama an d they did so after being told they had to rescue a countr y from the clamp of a cruel, depraved dictator ; once the y acted, the people of their country (the U .S .) marche d lockstep behind them . 1 1 After lengthy research, including interviews with Noriega in hi s Miami prison cell, Eisner states : On the key points, I do not think the evidence show s Noriega was guilty of the charges against him . I do no t think his actions as a foreign military leader or a sover- eign head of state justify the invasion of Panama or tha t he represented a threat to U .S . national security . 1 2 Eisner concludes : My analysis of the political situation and my reporting i n Panama before, during, and after the invasion brough t me to the conclusion that the U .S . invasion of Panam a was an abominable abuse of power . The invasion princi- pally served the goals of arrogant American politician s and their Panamanian allies, at the expense of uncon- scionable bloodshed . 13 The Arias family and the pre-Torrijos oligarchy, which had serve d as U .S . puppets from the time when Panama was torn from Colom- bia until Torrijos took over, were reinstated . The new Canal Treat y became a moot point . In essence, Washington once again con - trolled the waterway, despite anything the official documents said . As I reflected on those incidents and all that I had experience d while working for MAIN, I found myself asking the same question s over and over : How many decisions —including ones of great his- torical significance that impact millions of people—are made b y men and women who are driven by personal motives rather than b y a desire to do the right thing? How many of our top government of- ficials are driven by personal greed instead of national loyalty? Ho w many wars are fought because a president does not want his con- stituents to perceive him as a wimp ? Despite my promises to SWEC's president, my frustration an d feelings of impotence about the Panama invasion prodded me int o resuming work on my book, except now I decided to focus on Torrijos . I saw his story as a way to expose many of the injustices that infec t our world, and as a way to rid myself of my guilt . This time, however , I was determined to keep silent about what I was doing, rather tha n seeking advice from friends and peers . As I worked on the book, I was stunned by the magnitude of wha t we EHMs had accomplished, in so many places . I tried to concen- trate on a few countries that stood out, but the list of places where I had worked and which were worse off afterward was astounding . I also was horrified by the extent of my own corruption . I had done a great deal of soul searching, yet I realized that while I was in th e midst of it I had been so focused on my daily activities that I had no t seen the larger perspective . Thus, when I was in Indonesia I frette d over the things Howard Parker and I discussed, or the issues raise d by Rasy's young Indonesian friends . While I was working in Panama , I was deeply affected by the implications of what I had seen durin g Fidel's introduction of the slums, the Canal Zone, and the disco- theque . In Iran, my conversations with Yamin and Doc troubled m e immensely . Now, the act of writing this book gave me an overview I understood how easy it had been not to see the larger picture an d therefore to miss the true significance of my actions . How simple this sounds, and how self-evident ; yet, how insidiou s the nature of these experiences . For me it conjures the image of a 178 \t Part IV : 1981—Present \t The United States Invades Panama 179"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"soldier . In the beginning, he is naive .

They no longer fin d it necessary to march into the forests of Africa looking fo r prime specimens who will bring top dollar on the auction blocks in Charleston, Cartagena, and Havana .

Indeed, during the 1980s the majority of Americans knew littl e about the country . It simply was not on their radar screen . However , I was fascinated by what was going on there . I kept in touch with old friends who worked for the World Bank , USAID, the IMF, or one of the other international financial organi - zations, and with people at Bechtel, Halliburton, and the other majo r engineering and construction companies, including my own father - in-law . Many of the engineers employed by IPS subcontractors an d other independent power companies were also involved in project s in the Middle East . I was very aware that the EHMs were hard a t work in Iraq . The Reagan and Bush administrations were determined to tur n Iraq into another Saudi Arabia . There were many compelling rea- sons for Saddam Hussein to follow the example of the House o f Saud . He had only to observe the benefits they had reaped from th e Money-laundering Affair . Since that deal was struck, modern citie s had risen from the Saudi desert, Riyadh's garbage-collecting goat s had been transformed into sleek trucks, and now the Saudis enjoye d the fruits of some of the most advanced technologies in the world : state-of-the-art desalinization plants, sewage treatment systems , communications networks, and electric utility grids . Saddam Hussein undoubtedly was aware that the Saudis also en - joyed special treatment when it came to matters of international law . Their good friends in Washington turned a blind eye to many Saud i activities, including the financing of fanatical groups — many o f which were considered by most of the world to be radicals borderin g on terrorism — and the harboring of international fugitives . In fact , the United States actively sought and received Saudi Arabian finan - cial support for Osama bin Laden's Afghan war against the Sovie t Union . The Reagan and Bush administrations not only encourage d the Saudis in this regard, but also they pressured many other coun- tries to do the same — or at least to look the other way . The EHM presence in Baghdad was very strong during th e 1980s . They believed that Saddam eventually would see the light , and I had to agree with this assumption . After all, if Iraq reached a n accord with Washington similar to that of the Saudis, Saddam coul d basically write his own ticket in ruling his country, and might eve n expand his circle of influence throughout that part of the world . It hardly mattered that he was a pathological tyrant, that he ha d the blood of mass murders on his hands, or that his mannerisms an d brutal actions conjured images of Adolph Hitler . The United State s had tolerated and even supported such men many times before . W e would be happy to offer him U .S . government securities in exchang e for petrodollars, for the promise of continued oil supplies, and for a deal whereby the interest on those securities was used to hire U .S . companies to improve infrastructure systems throughout Iraq, t o create new cities, and to turn the deserts into oases . We would be will - ing to sell him tanks and fighter planes and to build him chemica l and nuclear power plants, as we had done in so many other countries , even if these technologies could conceivably be used to produce ad - vanced weaponry . Iraq was extremely important to us, much more important tha n was obvious on the surface . Contrary to common public opinion , Iraq is not simply about oil . It is also about water and geopolitics . Both the Tigris and Euphrates rivers flow through Iraq ; thus, of al l the countries in that part of the world, Iraq controls the most im- portant sources of increasingly critical water resources . During th e 1980s, the importance of water — politically as well as economically — was becoming obvious to those of us in the energy and engineerin g fields . In the rush toward privatization, many of the major companie s 182 \t An EHM Failure in Iraq 183"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"that had set their sights on taking over the small independent powe r companies now looked toward privatizing water systems in Africa , Latin America, and the Middle East . In addition to oil and water, Iraq is situated in a very strategic lo - cation . It borders Iran, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Syria, an d Turkey, and it has a coastline on the Persian Gulf . It is within eas y missile-striking distance of both Israel and the former Soviet Union . Military strategists equate modern Iraq to the Hudson River valle y during the French and Indian War and the American Revolution . I n the eighteenth century, the French, British, and Americans kne w that whoever controlled the Hudson River valley controlled the con - tinent . Today, it is common knowledge that whoever controls Ira q holds the key to controlling the Middle East . Above all else, Iraq presented a vast market for American tech- nology and engineering expertise . The fact that it sits atop one of th e world's most extensive oil fields (by some estimates, even greate r than Saudi Arabia's) assured that it was in a position to finance hug e infrastructure and industrialization programs . All the major player s — engineering and construction companies ; computer systems sup - pliers ; aircraft, missile, and tank manufacturers ; and pharmaceutica l and chemical companies — were focused on Iraq . However, by the late 1980s it was apparent that Saddam was no t buying into the EHM scenario . This was a major frustration and a great embarrassment to the first Bush administration . Like Panama , Iraq contributed to George H . W . Bush's wimp image . As Bus h searched for a way out, Saddam played into his hands . In Augus t 1990, he invaded the oil-rich sheikhdom of Kuwait . Bush responde d with a denunciation of Saddam for violating international law, eve n though it had been less than a year since Bush himself had stage d the illegal and unilateral invasion of Panama . It was no surprise when the president finally ordered an all-ou t military attack . Five hundred thousand U .S . troops were sent in a s part of an international force . During the early months of 1991, a n aerial assault was launched against Iraqi military and civilian tar - gets . It was followed by a one hundred-hour land assault that route d the outgunned and desperately inferior Iraqi army . Kuwait was safe . A true despot had been chastised, though not brought to justice . Bush's popularity ratings soared to 90 percent among the America n people . I was in Boston attending meetings at the time of the Iraq inva- sion — one of the few occasions when I was actually asked to d o something for SWEC . I vividly recall the enthusiasm that greete d Bush ' s decision . Naturally, people throughout the Stone & Webste r organization were excited, though not only because we had taken a stand against a murderous dictator . For them, a U .S . victory in Ira q offered possibilities for huge profits, promotions, and raises . The excitement was not limited to those of us in businesses tha t would directly benefit from war . People across the nation seemed al - most desperate to see our country reassert itself militarily . I believ e there were many reasons for this attitude, including the philosoph- ical change that occurred when Reagan defeated Carter, the Irania n hostages were released, and Reagan announced his intention t o renegotiate the Panama Canal Treaty . Bush's invasion of Panam a stirred the already smoldering flames . Beneath the patriotic rhetoric and the calls for action, however , I believe a much more subtle transformation was occurring in th e way U .S . commercial interests—and therefore most of the peopl e who worked for American corporations — viewed the world . Th e march toward global empire had become a reality in which much o f the country participated . The dual ideas of globalization and priva- tization were making significant inroads into our psyches . In the final analysis, this was not solely about the United States . The global empire had become just that ; it reached across all bor- ders . What we had previously considered U .S . corporations were no w truly international, even from a legal standpoint . Many of them wer e incorporated in a multitude of countries ; they could pick and choos e from an assortment of rules and regulations under which to conduc t their activities, and a multitude of globalizing trade agreements an d organizations made this even easier . Words like democracy, social - ism, and capitalism were becoming almost obsolete . Corporatocrac y had become a fact, and it increasingly exerted itself as the single ma - jor influence on world economies and politics . In a strange turn of events, I succumbed to the corporatocrac y when I sold IPS in November 1990 . It was a lucrative deal for m y partners and me, but we sold out mainly because Ashland Oil Com- pany put tremendous pressure on us . I knew from experience tha t fighting them would be extremely costly in many ways, while sellin g would make us wealthy . However, it did strike me as ironic that a n 184 Part IV : 1981—Present \t An EHM Failure in Iraq 185"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"oil company would become the new owners of my alternative energ y company ; part of me felt like a traitor . SWEC demanded very little of my time . Occasionally, I was aske d to fly to Boston for meetings or to help prepare a proposal . I wa s sometimes sent to places like Rio de Janeiro, to hobnob with th e movers and shakers there . Once, I flew to Guatemala on a private jet . I frequently called project managers to remind them that I was o n the payroll and available . Receiving all that money for doing so ver y little rubbed at my conscience . I knew the business well and wanted t o contribute something useful . But it simply was not on the agenda . The image of being a man in the middle haunted me . I wanted t o take some action that would justify my existence and that might tur n all the negatives of my past into something positive . I continued t o work surreptitiously—and very irregularly—on Conscience of a n Economic Hit Man, and yet I did not deceive myself into believin g that it would ever be published . In 1991, I began guiding small groups of people into the Amazo n to spend time with and learn from the Shuars, who were eager t o share their knowledge about environmental stewardship and indige- nous healing techniques . During the next few years, the demand fo r these trips increased rapidly and resulted in the formation of a non - profit organization, Dream Change Coalition . Dedicated to changin g the way people from industrialized countries see the earth and ou r relationship to it, Dream Change developed a following around th e world and empowered people to create organizations with simila r missions in many countries . TIME magazine selected it as one o f thirteen organizations whose Web sites best reflect the ideals an d goals of Earth Day . 1 Throughout the 1990s, I became increasingly involved in th e nonprofit world, helping to create several organizations and servin g on the board of directors of others . Many of these grew out of th e work of highly dedicated people at Dream Change and involve d working with indigenous people in Latin America — the Shuars an d Achuars of the Amazon, the Quechuas of the Andes, the Mayas i n Guatemala—or teaching people in the United States and Europ e about these cultures . SWEC approved of this philanthropic work ; i t was consistent with SWEC's own commitment to the United Way . I also wrote more books, always careful to focus on indigenous teach- ings and to avoid references to my EHM activities . Besides alleviating my boredom, these measures helped me keep in touch with Lati n America and the political issues that were dear to me . But try as I might to convince myself that my nonprofit and writ- ing activities provided a balance, that I was making amends for m y past activities, I found this increasingly difficult . In my heart, I kne w I was shirking my responsibilities to my daughter . Jessica was in- heriting a world where millions of children are born saddled wit h debts they will never be able to repay . And I had to accept responsi- bility for it . My books grew in popularity, especially one titled, The World I s As You Dream It . Its success led to increasing demands for me t o give workshops and lectures . Sometimes, standing in front of an au- dience in Boston or New York or Milan, I was struck by the irony . I f the world is as you dream it, why had I dreamed such a world? Ho w had I managed to play such an active role in manifesting such a nightmare ? In 1997, I was commissioned to teach a weeklong Omega Insti- tute workshop in the Caribbean, at a resort on St . John Island . I arrived late at night . When I awoke the next morning, I walked ont o a tiny balcony and found myself looking out at the very bay where , seventeen years earlier, I had made the decision to quit MAIN . I col - lapsed into a chair, overcome with emotion . Throughout the week, I spent much of my free time on that bal- cony, looking down at Leinster Bay, trying to understand my feelings . I came to realize that although I had quit, I had not taken the nex t step, and that my decision to remain in the middle was exacting a devastating toll . By the end of the week, I had concluded that the worl d around me was not one that I wanted to dream, and that I needed t o do exactly what I was instructing my students to do : to change m y dreams in ways that reflected what I really wanted in my life . When I returned home, I gave up my corporate consulting prac- tice . The president of SWEC who had hired me was now retired . A new man had come aboard, one who was younger than me and wa s apparently unconcerned about me telling my story . He had initiate d a cost-cutting program and was happy not to have to pay me that ex- orbitant retainer any longer . I decided to complete the book I had been working on for so long , and just making the decision brought a wonderful sense of relief . I shared my ideas about writing with close friends, mostly people i n 186 Part IV : 1981—Present \t An EHM Failure in Iraq 187"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":":: . the nonprofit world who were involved with indigenous cultures an d rain forest preservation . To my surprise, they were dismayed . The y feared that speaking out would undermine my teaching work an d jeopardize the nonprofit organizations I supported . Many of us wer e helping Amazon tribes protect their lands from oil companies ; com - ing clean, I was told, could undermine my credibility, and might se t back the whole movement . Some even threatened to withdra w their support . So, once again, I stopped writing . Instead, I focused on takin g people deep into the Amazon, showing them a place and a tribe tha t are mostly untouched by the modern world . In fact, that is where I was on September 11, 2001 . CHAPTER 3 2 September 11 and its Aftermat h for Me, Personall y On September 10, 2001, I was traveling down a river in th e Ecuadorian Amazon with Shakaim Chumpi, the coauthor of my boo k Spirit of the Shuar . We were leading a group of sixteen North Amer - icans to his community deep in the rain forest . The visitors had com e to learn about his people and to help them preserve their preciou s rain forests . Shakaim had fought as a soldier in the recent Ecuador-Peru con- flict . Most people in the major oil-consuming nations have neve r heard about this war, yet it was fought primarily to provide the m with oil . Although the border between these two countries was dis- puted for many years, only recently did a resolution become urgent . The reason for the urgency was that the oil companies needed t o know with which country to negotiate in order to win concession s for specific tracts of the oil-rich lands . Borders had to be defined . The Shuars formed Ecuador's first line of defense . They prove d themselves to be ferocious fighters, often overcoming superior num - bers and better-equipped forces . The Shuars did not know anythin g about the politics behind the war or that its resolution would ope n the door to oil companies . They fought because they come from a long tradition of warriors and because they were not about to allo w foreign soldiers onto their lands . As we paddled down the river, watching a flock of chattering parrot s fly overhead, I asked Shakaim whether the truce was still holding . 18s \t Part IV : 1981—Present \t 189"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"\" Yes, \" he said, \" but I'm afraid I must tell you that we are no w preparing to go to war with you . \" He went on to explain that, o f course, he did not mean me personally or the people in our group . \"You are our friends,\" he assured me . He was, he said, referring t o our oil companies and to the military forces that would come int o his jungle to defend them . \"We've seen what they did to the Huaorani tribe . They destroye d their forests, polluted the rivers, and killed many people, includin g children . Today, the Huaorani hardly exist as a people anymore . W e won't let that happen to us . We won't allow oil companies into ou r territory, any more than we would the Peruvians . We have all swor n to fight to the last man .\" 1 That night our group sat around a fire in the center of a beautifu l Shuar longhouse built from split bamboo slats placed in the groun d and covered with a thatched roof . I told them about my conversatio n with Shakaim . We all wondered how many other people in the worl d felt similarly about our oil companies and our country . How many , like the Shuars, were terrified that we would come into their live s and destroy their culture and their lands? How many hated us ? The next morning, I went down to the little office where we kep t our two-way radio . I needed to arrange for pilots to fly in and pick u s up in a few days . As I was talking with them, I heard a shout . \"My God!\" the man on the other end of the radio exclaimed . \"Ne w York is under attack .\" He turned up the commercial radio that ha d been playing music in the background . During the next half hour, w e received a minute-by-minute account of the events unfolding in th e United States . Like everyone else, it was a moment I shall never forget . When I returned to my home in Florida, I knew I had to visi t Ground Zero, the former site of the World Trade Center towers, so I arranged to fly to New York . I checked into my uptown hotel in earl y afternoon . It was a sunny November day, unseasonably balmy . I strolled along Central Park, filled with enthusiasm, then headed fo r a part of the city where once I had spent a lot of time, the area nea r Wall Street now known as Ground Zero . As I approached, my enthusiasm was replaced with a sense o f horror . The sights and smells were overwhelming —the incredibl e destruction ; the twisted and melted skeletons of those once-grea t buildings ; the debris ; the rancid odor of smoke, charred ruins, and burnt flesh . I had seen it all on TV, but being here was different . I had not been prepared for this—especially not for the people . Two months had passed and still they stood around, those who live d or worked nearby, those who had survived . An Egyptian man was loi - tering outside his small shoe repair shop, shaking his head in disbelief . \"Can't get used to it,\" he muttered . \"I lost many customers, man y friends . My nephew died up there .\" He pointed at the blue sky . \" I think I saw him jump . I don't know . . . So many were jumping, hold- ing hands and flapping their arms as though they could fly . \" It came as a surprise, the way people talked with one another . I n New York City And it went beyond language . Their eyes met . Al - though somber, they exchanged looks of compassion, half-smile s that spoke more than a million words . But there was something else, a sense about the place itself . A t first, I couldn't figure it out ; then it struck me : the light . Lower Man- hattan had been a dark canyon, back in the days when I made th e pilgrimage to this part of town to raise capital for IPS, when I use d to plot strategy with my investment bankers over dinner at Window s on the World . You had to go that high, to the top of the World Trad e Center, if you wanted to see light . Now, here it was at street level . The canyon had been split wide open, and we who stood on th e street beside the ruins were warmed by the sunshine . I couldn't hel p wondering if the view of the sky, of the light, had helped people ope n their hearts . I felt guilty just thinking such thoughts . I turned the corner at Trinity Church and headed down Wal l Street . Back to the old New York, enveloped in shadow . No sky n o light . People hurried along the sidewalk, ignoring one another . A co p screamed at a stalled car . I sat down on the first steps I came to, at number fourteen . Fro m somewhere, the sounds of giant fans or an air blower rose above th e other noises . It seemed to come from the massive stone wall of th e New York Stock Exchange building . I watched the people . They hus - tled up and down the street, leaving their offices, hurrying home, o r heading to a restaurant or bar to discuss business . A few walked i n tandem and chatted with each other . Most, though, were alone an d silent . I tried to make eye contact ; it didn't happen . The wail of a car alarm drew my attention down the street . A ma n rushed out of an office and pointed a key at the car ; the alarm wen t 190 Part Iv : 1981-Present \t September 11 and its Aftermath for Me, Personally 191"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"silent . I sat there quietly for a few long moments . After a while, I reached into my pocket and pulled out a neatly folded piece of pape r covered with statistics . Then I saw him . He shuffled along the street, staring down at hi s feet . He had a scrawny gray beard and wore a grimy overcoat tha t looked especially out of place on this warm afternoon on Wall Street . I knew he was Afghan . He glanced at me . Then, after only a second of hesitation, h e started up the steps . He nodded politely and sat down beside me , leaving a yard or two between us . From the way he looked straigh t ahead, I realized it would be up to me to begin the conversation . \"Nice afternoon . \" \"Beautiful .\" His accent was thick . \"Times like these, we want sun - shine . \" \"You mean because of the World Trade Center? \" He nodded . \"You're from Afghanistan? \" He stared at me . \"Is it so obvious? \" \"I've traveled a lot . Recently, I visited the Himalayas, Kashmir . \" \"Kashmir .\" He pulled at his beard . \"Fighting . \" \"Yes, India and Pakistan, Hindus and Muslims . Makes you won - der about religion, doesn't it? \" His eyes met mine . They were deep brown, nearly black . The y struck me as wise and sad . He turned back toward the New Yor k Stock Exchange building . With a long gnarled finger, he pointed a t the building . \"Or maybe,\" I agreed, \"it's about economics, not religion . \" \"You were a soldier? \" I couldn't help but chuckle . \"No . An economic consultant .\" I handed him the paper with the statistics . \"These were my weapons . \" He reached over and took them . \"Numbers . \" \"World statistics . \" He studied the list, then gave a little laugh . \"I can't read .\" H e handed it back to me . \"The numbers tell us that twenty-four thousand people die ever y day from hunger . \" He whistled softly, then took a moment to think about this, an d sighed . \"I was almost one of them . I had a little pomegranate far m near Kandahar . Russians arrived and mujahideen hid behind trees and in water ditches .\" He raised his hands and pointed them like a rifle . \" Ambushing\" He lowered his hands . \"All my trees and ditche s were destroyed . \" ' After that, what did you do? \" He nodded at the list I held . \"Does it show beggars? \" It did not, but I thought I remembered . \"About eighty million i n the world, I believe . \" \"I was one .\" He shook his head, seemed lost in thought . We sat i n silence for a few minutes before he spoke again . \"I do not like beg- garing . My child dies . So I raise poppies . \" \"Opium? \" He shrugged . \"No trees, no water . The only way to feed our families . \" I felt a lump in my throat, a depressing sense of sadness com- bined with guilt . \"We call raising opium poppies evil, yet many of ou r wealthiest people owe their fortunes to the drug trade . \" His eyes met mine and seemed to penetrate my soul . \"You were a soldier,\" he stated, nodding his head to confirm this simple fact . Then he rose slowly to his feet and hobbled down the steps . I wante d him to stay, but I felt powerless to say anything . I managed to get t o my feet and start after him . At the bottom of the steps I was stoppe d by a sign . It included a picture of the building where I had been seated . At the top, it notified passersby that the sign had been erected b y Heritage Trails of New York . It said : The Mausoleum of Halicarnassus piled on top of the bel l tower of St . Mark's in Venice, at the corner of Wall an d Broad —that's the design concept behind 14 Wall Street . In its day the world's tallest bank building, the 539-foot- high skyscraper originally housed the headquarters o f Bankers Trust, one of the country's wealthiest financia l institutions . I stood there in awe and looked up at this building . Shortly afte r the turn of the last century, 14 Wall Street had played the role th e World Trade Center would later assume ; it had been the very symbo l of power and economic domination . It had also housed Banker s Trust, one of the firms I had employed to finance my energy com- pany . It was an essential part of my heritage — the heritage, as the ol d Afghan man so aptly put it, of a soldier . That I had ended up here this day, talking with him, seemed a n 192 Part IV : 1981—Present \t September 11 and its Aftermath for Me, Personally 193"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"odd coincidence . Coincidence . The word stopped me . I thought abou t how our reactions to coincidences mold our lives . How should I re - act to this one ? Continuing to walk, I scanned the heads in the crowd, but I coul d find no sign of him . At the next building, there was an immens e statue shrouded in blue plastic . An engraving on the building's ston e face revealed that this was Federal Hall, 26 Wall Street, where o n April 30, 1789, George Washington had taken the oath of office a s first president of the United States . This was the exact spot wher e the first man given the responsibility to safeguard life, liberty, an d the pursuit of happiness for all people was sworn in . So close t o Ground Zero ; so close to Wall Street . I went on around the block, to Pine Street . There I came face-to - face with the world headquarters of Chase, the bank David Rocke- feller built, a bank seeded with oil money and harvested by men lik e me . This bank, an institution that served the EHMs and that was a master at promoting global empire, was in many ways the very sym - bol of the corporatocracy . I recalled reading that the World Trade Center was a projec t started by David Rockefeller in 1960, and that in recent years th e complex had been considered an albatross . It had the reputation o f being a financial misfit, unsuited to modern fiber-optic and Interne t technologies, and burdened with an inefficient and costly elevato r system . Those two towers once had been nicknamed David and Nel - son, Now the albatross was gone . I kept walking, slowly, almost reluctantly . Despite the warmth o f the afternoon, I felt a chill, and I realized that a strange anxiousness , a foreboding, had taken hold of me . I could not identify its sourc e and I tried to brush it off, picking up my pace . I eventually foun d myself once again looking at that smoldering hole, the twisted metal , that great scar in the earth . I leaned against a building that had es - caped the destruction and stared into the pit . I tried to imagine th e people rushing out of the collapsing tower and the firefighters dashin g in to help them . I tried to think about the people who had jumped , the desperation they felt . But none of these things came to me . Instead, I saw Osama bin Laden accepting money, and weapon s worth millions of dollars, from a man employed by a consultin g company under contract to the United States government . Then I saw myself sitting at a computer with a blank screen . I looked around, away from Ground Zero, at the New Yor k streets that had avoided the fire and now were returning to normal . I wondered what the people who walked those streets today though t about all this — not simply about the destruction of the towers, bu t also about the ruined pomegranate farms and the twenty-fou r thousand who starve every single day . I wondered if they though t about such things at all, if they could tear themselves away fro m their jobs and gas-guzzling cars and their interest payments lon g enough to consider their own contribution to the world they wer e passing on to their children . I wondered what they knew about Af- ghanistan — not the Afghanistan on television, the one littered wit h U .S . military tents and tanks, but the old man's Afghanistan . I won- dered what those twenty-four thousand who die every day think . And then I saw myself again, sitting before a blank compute r screen . I forced my attention back to Ground Zero . At the moment, on e thing was certain : my country was thinking about revenge, and it wa s focusing on countries like Afghanistan . But I was thinking about al l the other places in the world where people hate our companies, ou r military, our policies, and our march toward global empire . I wondered, What about Panama, Ecuador, Indonesia, Iran , Guatemala, most of Africa ? I pushed myself off the wall I had been leaning against an d started walking away . A short, swarthy man was waving a newspape r in the air and shouting in Spanish . I stopped . \"Venezuela on the brink of revolution!\" he yelled above the nois e of the traffic, the honking horns, and the milling people . I bought his paper and stood there for a moment scanning th e lead article . It was about Hugo Chavez, Venezuela's democraticall y elected, anti-American president, and the undercurrent of hatre d generated by U .S . policies in Latin America . What about Venezuela ? 194 Part IV : 1981—Present \t September 11 and its Aftermath for Me, Personally 195"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 3 3 Venezuela : Saved by Sadda m I had watched Venezuela for many years . It was a classic example o f a country that rose from rags to riches as a result of oil . It was also a model of the turmoil oil wealth foments, of the disequilibrium be- tween rich and poor, and of a country shamelessly exploited by th e corporatocracy : It had become the epitome of a place where old-styl e EHMs like me converged with the new-style, corporate version . The events I read about in the newspaper that day at Groun d Zero were a direct result of the 1998 elections, when the poor an d disenfranchised of Venezuela elected Hugo Chavez by a landslide a s their president . ) He immediately instituted drastic measures, takin g control of the courts and other institutions and dissolving the Vene - zuelan Congress . He denounced the United States for its \"shameles s imperialism,\" spoke out forcefully against globalization, and introduce d a hydrocarbons law that was reminiscent, even in name, to the on e Jaime Roldos had brought to Ecuador shortly before his airplan e went down . The law doubled the royalties charged to foreign oil com - panies . Then Chavez defied the traditional independence of th e state-owned oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela, by replacing it s top executives with people loyal to him . 2 Venezuelan oil is crucial to economies around the world . In 200 2 the nation was the world's fourth-largest oil exporter and the number - three supplier to the United States . 3 Petroleos de Venezuela, wit h forty thousand employees and $50 billion a year in sales, provide s 80 percent of the country's export revenue . It is by far the most important factor in Venezuel a ' s economy . 4 By taking over the indus - try, Chavez had thrust himself onto the world stage as a major player . Many Venezuelans saw this as destiny ; the completion of a proces s that began eighty years earlier . On December 14, 1922, a huge oi l blowout had gushed from the earth near Maracaibo . One hundre d thousand barrels of crude sprayed into the air each day for the nex t three days, and this single geologic event changed Venezuela forever . By 1930, the country was the world's largest oil exporter . Venezue- lans looked to oil as a solution to all their problems . Oil revenues during the next forty years enabled Venezuela t o evolve from one of the most impoverished nations in the world t o one of the wealthiest in Latin America . All of the country's vital sta - tistics improved : health care, education, employment, longevity, an d infant survival rates . Businesses prospered . During the 1973 OPEC oil embargo, petroleum prices skyrock- eted and Venezuela's national budget quadrupled . The EHMs wen t to work . The international banks flooded the country with loans tha t paid for vast infrastructure and industrial projects and for th e highest skyscrapers on the continent . Then, in the 1980s, the corpo- rate-style EHMs arrived . It was an ideal opportunity for them to cu t their fledgling teeth . The Venezuelan middle class had become siz- able, and provided a ripe market for a vast array of products, ye t there was still a very large poor sector available to labor in the sweat - shops and factories . Then oil prices crashed, and Venezuela could not repay its debts . In 1989, the IMF imposed harsh austerity measures and pressure d Caracas to support the corporatocracy in many other ways . Vene- zuelans reacted violently ; riots killed over two hundred people . Th e illusion of oil as a bottomless source of support was shattered . Betwee n 1978 and 2003, Venezuela's per capita income plummeted by ove r 40 percent . ' As poverty increased, resentment intensified . Polarization re- sulted, with the middle class pitted against the poor . As so often occur s in countries whose economies depend on oil production, demo - graphics radically shifted . The sinking economy took its toll on th e middle class, and many fell into the ranks of the poor . The new demographics set the stage for Chavez — and for conflic t with Washington . Once in power, the new president took action s 196 \t Venezuela : Saved by Saddam 197"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"that challenged the Bush administration . Just before the Septembe r 11 attacks, Washington was considering its options . The EHMs ha d failed ; was it time to send in the jackals ? Then 9/11 changed all priorities . President Bush and his adviser s focused on rallying the world community to support U .S . activities i n Afghanistan and an invasion of Iraq . On top of that, the U .S . econ- omy was in the middle of a recession . Venezuela was relegated to a back burner . However, it was obvious that at some point Bush an d Chavez would come to blows . With Iraqi and other Middle Easter n oil supplies threatened, Washington could not afford to ignor e Venezuela for long . Wandering around Ground Zero and Wall Street, meeting the ol d Afghan man, and reading about Chavez's Venezuela brought me to a point I had avoided for many years, and it forced me to take a har d look at the consequences of the things I had done over the past thre e decades . I could not possibly deny the role I had played or the fac t that my work as an EHM now affected my daughter's generation i n very negative ways . I knew I could no longer postpone taking actio n to atone for what I had done . I had to come clean about my life, i n a manner that would help people wake up to the fact of corpora- tocracy and understand why so much of the world hates us . I started writing once again, but as I did so, it seemed to me tha t my story was too old . Somehow, I needed to bring it up to date . I considered traveling to Afghanistan, Iraq, and Venezuela and writin g a contemporary commentary on those three countries . They seeme d to embody an irony of current world affairs : each had undergon e traumatic political turmoil and ended up with leaders who left a great deal to be desired (a cruel and despotic Taliban, a psychopathi c Saddam, and an economically inept Chavez), yet in no case did th e corporatocracy respond by attempting to solve the deeper problems o f these countries . Rather, the response was simply to undermine leader s who stood in the way of our oil policies . In many respects, Venezuel a was the most intriguing case because, while military interventio n had already occurred in Afghanistan and appeared inevitable in Iraq , the administration's response to Chavez remained a mystery . As fa r as I was concerned, the issue was not about whether Chavez was a good leader ; it was about Washington's reaction to a leader wh o stood in the way of the corporatocracy's march to global empire . Before I had time to organize such a trip, however, circumstance s once again intervened . My nonprofit work took me to South Americ a several times in 2002 . A Venezuelan family whose businesses were go - ing bankrupt under the Chavez regime joined one of my trips to th e Amazon . We became close friends, and I heard their side of the story . I also met with Latin Americans from the other end of the economi c spectrum, who considered Chavez a savior . The events unfolding i n Caracas were symptomatic of the world we EHMs had created . By December 2002, the situation in both Venezuela and in Ira q reached crisis points . The two countries were evolving into perfec t counterpoints for each other . In Iraq, all the subtle efforts —both th e EHMs and the jackals — had failed to force Saddam to comply, an d now we were preparing for the ultimate solution, invasion . In Vene- zuela, the Bush administration was bringing Kermit Roosevelt' s Iranian model into play . As the New York Times reported , Hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans filled the street s here today to declare their commitment to a nationa l strike, now in its 28th day, to force the ouster of Presi- dent Hugo Chavez . The strike, joined by an estimated 30,000 oil workers , threatens to wreak havoc on this nation, the world's fifth - largest oil producer, for months to come . . . In recent days, the strike has reached a kind of stale - mate . Mr . Chavez is using nonstriking workers to try t o normalize operations at the state-owned oil company . His opponents, led by a coalition of business and labo r leaders, contend, though, that their strike will push th e company, and thus the Chavez government, to collapse . 6 This was exactly how the CIA brought down Mossadegh and re - placed him with the shah . The analogy could not have been stronger . It seemed history was uncannily repeating itself, fifty years later . Five decades, and still oil was the driving force . Chavez's supporters continued to clash with his opponents . Sev- eral people, it was reported, were shot to death and dozens mor e were wounded . The next day, I talked with an old friend who fo r many years had been involved with the jackals . Like me, he ha d 198 \t Part IV : 1981—Present \t Venezuela : Saved by Saddam 199"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"never worked directly for any government, but he had led clandes- tine operations in many countries . He told me that a private con - tractor had approached him to foment strikes in Caracas and t o bribe military officers — many of whom had been trained at th e School of the Americas — to turn against their elected president . H e had turned down the offer, but he confided, \"The man who took th e job knows what he's doing .\" 7 Oil company executives and Wall Street feared a rise in oil price s and a decline in American inventories . Given the Middle East situ- ation, I knew the Bush administration was doing everything in it s power to overthrow Chavez . Then came the news that they had suc- ceeded ; Chavez had been ousted . The New York Times took this tur n of events as an opportunity to provide a historical perspective — an d also to identify the man who appeared to play the Kermit Roosevel t role in contemporary Venezuela : The TJnited States . . . supported authoritarian regime s throughout Central and South America during and afte r the Cold War in defense of its economic and politica l interests . In tiny Guatemala, the Central Intelligence Agenc y mounted a coup overthrowing the democratically electe d government in 1954, and it backed subsequent right - wing governments against small leftist rebel groups fo r four decades . Roughly 200,000 civilians died . In Chile, a CIA-supported coup helped put Gen . Augusto Pinochet in power from 1973 to 1990 . In Peru , a fragile democratic government is still unraveling th e agency's role in a decade of support for the now-depose d and disgraced president, Alberto K . Fujimori, and hi s disreputable spy chief, Vladimiro L . Montesinos . The United States had to invade Panama in 1989 t o topple its narco-dictator, Manuel A . Noriega, who, fo r almost 20 years, was a valued informant for America n intelligence . And the struggle to mount an unarme d opposition against Nicaragua's leftists in the 1980s b y any means necessary, including selling arms to Iran fo r cold cash, led to indictments against senior Reaga n administration officials . Among those investigated back then was Otto J . Reich , a veteran of Latin American struggles . No charges wer e ever filed against Mr . Reich . He later became United State s Ambassador to Venezuela and now serves as assistant sec- retary of state for inter-American affairs by presidential ap- pointment . The fall of Mr . Chavez is a feather in his cap . 8 If Mr . Reich and the Bush administration were celebrating th e coup against Chavez, the party was suddenly cut short . In an amaz- ing turnabout, Chavez regained the upper hand and was back i n power less than seventy-two hours later . Unlike Mossadegh in Iran , Chavez had managed to keep the military on his side, despite all at - tempts to turn its highest-ranking officers against him . In addition , he had the powerful state oil company on his side . Petroleos d e Venezuela defied the thousands of striking workers and made a comeback . Once the dust cleared, Chavez tightened his government's grip o n oil company employees, purged the military of the few disloyal offi- cers who had been persuaded to betray him, and forced many of hi s key opponents out of the country . He demanded twenty-year priso n terms for two prominent opposition leaders, Washington-connecte d operatives who had joined the jackals to direct the nationwide strike . 9 In the final analysis, the entire sequence of events was a calamit y for the Bush administration . As the Los Angeles Times reported , Bush administration officials acknowledged Tuesday tha t they had discussed the removal of Venezuelan Presiden t Hugo Chavez for months with military and civilian lead- ers from Venezuela . . . The administration's handling o f the abortive coup has come under increasing scrutiny . l o It was obvious that not only had the EHMs failed, but so had th e jackals . Venezuela in 2003 turned out to be very different from Ira n in 1953 . I wondered if this was a harbinger or simply an anomaly — and what Washington would do next . At least for the time being, I believe a serious crisis was averted i n Venezuela—and Chavez was saved —by Saddam Hussein . The Bus h administration could not take on Afghanistan, Iraq, and Venezuel a all at once . At the moment, it had neither the military muscle nor th e 200 Part IV : 1981—Present \t Venezuela : Saved by Saddam 201"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":",a a political support to do so . I knew, however, that such circumstance s could change quickly, and that President Chavez was likely to fac e fierce opposition in the near future . Nonetheless, Venezuela was a reminder that not much had changed in fifty years — except the out - come . CHAPTER 3 4 Ecuador Revisite d Venezuela was a classic case . However, as I watched events unfold- ing there, I was struck by the fact that the truly significant battl e lines were being drawn in yet another country . They were significan t not because they represented more in terms of dollars or human lives , but because they involved issues that went far beyond the materialis - tic goals that generally define empires . These battle lines extende d beyond the armies of bankers, business executives, and politicians , deep into the soul of modern civilization . And they were being es- tablished in a country I had come to know and love, the one wher e I had first worked as a Peace Corps volunteer : Ecuador . In the years since I first went there, in 1968, this tiny country ha d evolved into the quintessential victim of the corporatocracy . My con - temporaries and I, and our modern corporate equivalents, ha d managed to bring it to virtual bankruptcy . We loaned it billions o f dollars so it could hire our engineering and construction firms t o build projects that would help its richest families . As a result, i n those three decades, the official poverty level grew from 50 to 70 per - cent, under- or unemployment increased from 15 to 70 percent, pub- lic debt increased from $240 million to $16 billion, and the share o f national resources allocated to the poorest citizens declined from 2 0 percent to 6 percent . Today, Ecuador must devote nearly 50 percen t of its national budget simply to paying off its debts — instead of t o helping the millions of its citizens who are officially classified as dan - gerously impoverished . l 202 \t Part IV : 1981—Present \t 203"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"The situation in Ecuador clearly demonstrates that this was no t the result of a conspiracy ; it was a process that had occurred durin g both Democratic and Republican administrations, a process tha t had involved all the major multinational banks, many corporations , and foreign aid missions from a multitude of countries . The Unite d States played the lead role, but we had not acted alone . During those three decades, thousands of men and women par- ticipated in bringing Ecuador to the tenuous position it found itsel f in at the beginning of the millennium . Some of them, like me, ha d been aware of what they were doing, but the vast majority ha d merely performed the tasks they had been taught in business, engi- neering, and law schools, or had followed the lead of bosses in m y mold, who demonstrated the system by their own greedy exampl e and through rewards and punishments calculated to perpetuate it . Such participants saw the parts they played as benign, at worst ; i n the most optimistic view, they were helping an impoverished nation . Although unconscious, deceived, and — in many cases — self - deluded, these players were not members of any clandestine conspir - acy ; rather, they were the product of a system that promotes th e most subtle and effective form of imperialism the world has ever wit - nessed . No one had to go out and seek men and women who could b e bribed or threatened — they had already been recruited by companies , banks, and government agencies . The bribes consisted of salaries , bonuses, pensions, and insurance policies ; the threats were based o n social mores, peer pressure, and unspoken questions about the fu- ture of their children's education . The system had succeeded spectacularly . By the time the ne w millennium rolled in, Ecuador was thoroughly entrapped . We ha d her, just as a Mafia don has the man whose daughter's wedding an d small business he has financed and then refinanced . Like any goo d Mafiosi, we had taken our time . We could afford to be patient, know - ing that beneath Ecuador's rain forests lies a sea of oil, knowing tha t the proper day would come . That day had already arrived when, in early 2003, I wound m y way from Quito to the jungle town of Shell in my Subaru Outback . Chavez had reestablished himself in Venezuela . He had defied Georg e W . Bush and had won . Saddam was standing his ground and wa s preparing to be invaded . Oil supplies were depleted to their lowes t level in nearly three decades, and the prospects of taking more from our prime sources looked bleak — and therefore, so did the health o f the corporatocrac y ' s balance sheets . We needed an ace in the hole . I t was time to cut away our Ecuadorian pound of flesh . As I drove past the monster dam on the Pastaza River, I realize d that here in Ecuador the battle was not simply the classic struggl e between the rich of the world and the impoverished, between thos e who exploit and the exploited . These battle lines would ultimatel y define who we are as a civilization . We were poised to force this tin y country to open its Amazon rain forests to our oil companies . Th e devastation that would result was immeasurable . If we insisted on collecting the debt, the repercussions would g o far beyond our abilities to quantify them . It was not just about th e destruction of indigenous cultures, human lives, and hundreds o f thousands of species of animals, reptiles, fish, insects, and plants , some of which might contain the undiscovered cures to any numbe r of diseases . It was not just that rain forests absorb the deadly green - house gases produced by our industries, give off the oxygen that i s essential to our lives, and seed the clouds that ultimately create a large percentage of the world's fresh water . It went beyond all th e standard arguments made by ecologists for saving such places, an d reached deep into our souls . If we pursued this strategy, we would continue an imperialist pat - tern that had begun long before the Roman Empire . We decry slavery , but our global empire enslaves more people than the Romans and al l the other colonial powers before us . I wondered how we could execut e such a shortsighted policy in Ecuador and still live with our collec- tive conscience . Peering through the window of the Subaru at the deforeste d slopes of the Andes, an area that during my Peace Corps days ha d been lush with tropical growth, I was suddenly surprised by anothe r realization . It dawned on me that this view of Ecuador as a signifi- cant battle line was purely personal, that in fact every country wher e I had worked, every country with resources coveted by the empire , was equally significant . I had my own attachment to this one, whic h stemmed from those days back in the late 1960s when I lost my in- nocence here . However, it was subjective, my personal bias . Though the Ecuadorian rain forests are precious, as are the in- digenous people and all the other life forms that inhabit them, the y are no more precious than the deserts of Iran and the Bedouins o f 204 \t Part IV : 1981—Present \t Ecuador Revisited \t 205"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"Yamin's heritage . No more precious than the mountains of Java, th e seas off the coast of the Philippines, the steppes of Asia, the savanna s of Africa, the forests of North America, the icecaps of the Arctic, o r hundreds of other threatened places . Every one of these represent s a battle line, and every one of them forces us to search the depths o f our individual and collective souls . I was reminded of a statistic that sums it all up : The income rati o of the one-fifth of the world's population in the wealthiest countrie s to the one-fifth in the poorest countries went from 30 to 1 in 1960 t o 74 to 1 in 1995 . 2 And the World Bank, the U .S . Agency for Interna- tional Development, the IMF, and the rest of the banks, corporations , and governments involved in international \"aid\" continue to tell u s that they are doing their jobs, that progress has been made . So here I was in Ecuador again, in the country that was just on e of many battle lines but that holds a special place in my heart . It wa s 2003, thirty-five years after I had first arrived as a member of a U .S . organization that bears the word peace in its name . This time, I had come in order to try to prevent a war that for three decades I ha d helped to provoke . It would seem that events in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Venezuel a might be enough to deter us from another conflict ; yet, in Ecuado r the situation was very different . This war would not require the U .S . Army, for it would be fought by a few thousand indigenous warrior s equipped only with spears, machetes, and single-shot, muzzle-loade d rifles . They would face off against a modern Ecuadorian army, a handful of U .S . Special Forces advisers, and jackal-trained merce- naries hired by the oil companies . This would be a war, like the 199 5 conflict between Ecuador and Peru, that most people in the Unite d States would never hear about, and recent events had escalated th e probability of such a war . In December 2002, oil company representatives accused an in- digenous community of taking a team of its workers hostage ; the y suggested that the warriors involved were members of a terroris t group, with implications of possible ties to al-Qaeda . It was an issu e made especially complicated because the oil company had not receive d government permission to begin drilling . However, the compan y claimed its workers had the right to perform preliminary, non - drilling investigations — a claim vehemently disputed by the indige- nous groups a few days later, when they shared their side of the story' . The oil workers, tribal representatives insisted, had trespassed o n lands where they were not allowed ; the warriors had carried n o weapons, nor had they threatened the oil workers with violence o f any sort . In fact, they had escorted the workers to their village, wher e they offered them food and chicha, a local beer . While their visitor s feasted, the warriors persuaded the workers' guides to paddle away . However, the tribe claimed, the workers were never held agains t their will ; they were free to go wherever they pleased . 3 Driving down that road, I remembered what the Shuars had tol d me in 1990 when, after selling IPS, I returned to offer to help the m save their forests . \"The world is as you dream it,\" they had said, an d then pointed out that we in the North had dreamed of huge indus- tries, lots of cars, and gigantic skyscrapers . Now we had discovere d that our vision had in fact been a nightmare that would ultimatel y destroy us all . \"Change that dream,\" the Shuars had advised me . Yet here it was , more than a decade later, and despite the work of many people an d nonprofit organizations, including the ones I had worked with, th e nightmare had reached new and horrifying proportions . When my Outback finally pulled into the jungle town of Shell, I was hustled off to a meeting . The men and women who attende d represented many tribes : Kichwa, Shuar, Achuar, Shiwiar, and Za- paro . Some had walked for days through the jungle, others had flow n in on small planes, funded by nonprofits . A few wore their traditiona l kilts, face paint, and feathered headbands, though most attempte d to emulate the townspeople, wearing slacks, T-shirts, and shoes . Representatives from the community accused of taking hostage s spoke first . They told us that shortly after the workers returned t o the oil company, over a hundred Ecuadorian soldiers arrived in thei r small community . They reminded us that this was at the beginnin g of a special season in the rain forests, the fruiting of the chonta . A tree sacred to indigenous cultures, its fruit comes but once a yea r and signals the start of the mating season for many of the region' s birds, including rare and endangered species . As they flock to it, th e birds are extremely vulnerable . The tribes enforce strict policie s forbidding the hunting of these birds during chonta season . \"The timing of the soldiers couldn't have been worse,\" a woma n explained . I felt her pain and that of her companions as they tol d their tragic stories about how the soldiers ignored the prohibitions . 206 \t Part IV : 1981—Present \t Ecuador Revisited \t 207"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"They shot down the birds for sport and for food . In addition, the y raided family gardens, banana groves, and manioc fields, often ir- reparably destroying the sparse topsoil . They used explosives in th e rivers for fishing, and they ate family pets . They confiscated the loca l hunters' guns and blowguns, dug improper latrines, polluted th e rivers with fuel oil and solvents, sexually molested women, and ne- glected to properly dispose of garbage, which attracted insects an d vermin . \"We had two choices,\" a man said . \"We could fight, or we coul d swallow our pride and do our best to repair the damage .

He called it a fast, but in fact it sounde d closer to voluntary starvation . Old people and children became mal - nourished and grew sick . They spoke about threats and bribes . \"My son,\" a woman said , \"speaks English as well as Spanish and several indigenous dialects . He worked as a guide and translator for an ecotourist company . They paid him a decent salary . The oil company offered him te n times as much . What could he do? Now he writes letters denouncin g his old company and all the others who come to help us, and in hi s letters calls the oil companies our friends .\" She shook her body, lik e a dog shaking off water . \"He is no longer one of us . My son . . . \" An elderly man wearing the traditional toucan-feather headdres s of a shaman stood up . \"You know about those three we elected t o represent us against the oil companies, who died in that plane crash ? Well, I'm not going to stand here and tell you what so many say, tha t the oil companies caused the crash . But I can tell you that those thre e deaths dug a big hole in our organization . The oil companies lost n o time filling that hole with their people? ' Another man produced a contract and read it . In exchange fo r three hundred thousand dollars, it ceded a vast territory over to a lumber company . It was signed by three tribal officials . \"These aren't their real signatures,\" he said . \"I ought to know ; one i s my brother . It's another type of assassination . To discredit our leaders . \" It seemed ironic and strangely appropriate that this was takin g place in a region of Ecuador where the oil companies had not ye t been given permission to drill . They had drilled in many area s around this one, and the indigenous people had seen the results, had witnessed the destruction of their neighbors . As I sat there listening , I asked myself how the citizens of my country would react if gather- ings like this were featured on CNN or the evening news . The meetings were fascinating and the revelations deeply disturbing . But something else also happened, outside the formal setting o f those sessions . During breaks, at lunch, and in the evening, when I talked with people privately, I frequently was asked why the Unite d States was threatening Iraq . The impending war was discussed o n the front pages of Ecuadorian newspapers that made their way int o this jungle town, and the coverage was very different from coverag e in the States . It included references to the Bush family's ownershi p of oil companies and United Fruit, and to Vice President Cheney' s role as former CEO of Halliburton . These newspapers were read to men and women who had neve r attended school . Everyone seemed to take an interest in this issue . Here I was, in the Amazon rain forest, among illiterate people man y in North America consider \"backward,\" even \"savages,\" and yet prob - ing questions were being asked that struck at the heart of the globa l empire . Driving out of Shell, back past the hydroelectric dam and hig h into the Andes, I kept thinking about the difference between what I had seen and heard during this visit to Ecuador and what I had be - come accustomed to in the United States . It seemed that Amazonia n tribes had a great deal to teach us, that despite all our schooling an d our many hours reading magazines and watching television news , we lacked an awareness they had somehow found . This line of think- ing made me think of \"The Prophecy of the Condor and Eagle,\" whic h I have heard many times throughout Latin America, and of simila r prophecies I have encountered around the world . Nearly every culture I know prophesies that in the late 1990s w e entered a period of remarkable transition . At monasteries in the Hi- malayas, ceremonial sites in Indonesia, and indigenous reservation s in North America, from the depths of the Amazon to the peaks of th e Andes and into the ancient Mayan cities of Central America, I hav e heard that ours is a special moment in human history, and that eac h of us was born at this time because we have a mission to accomplish . The titles and words of the prophecies differ slightly . They tel l variously of a New Age, the Third Millennium, the Age of Aquarius , the Beginning of the Fifth Sun, or the end of old calendars and th e 208 \t Part IV : 1981—Present \t Ecuador Revisited \t 209"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"commencement of new ones . Despite the varying terminologies , however, they have a great deal in common, and \"The Prophecy o f the Condor and Eagle\" is typical . It states that back in the mists o f history, human societies divided and took two different paths : tha t of the condor (representing the heart, intuitive and mystical) an d that of the eagle (representing the brain, rational and material) . I n the 1490s, the prophecy said, the two paths would converge and th e eagle would drive the condor to the verge of extinction . Then, fiv e hundred years later, in the 1990s, a new epoch would begin, one i n which the condor and eagle will have the opportunity to reunite an d fly together in the same sky, along the same path . If the condor an d eagle accept this opportunity, they will create a most remarkable off - spring, unlike any ever seen before . \"The Prophecy of the Condor and Eagle\" can be taken at man y levels—the standard interpretation is that it foretells the sharin g of indigenous knowledge with the technologies of science, the bal- ancing of yin and yang, and the bridging of northern and souther n cultures . However, most powerful is the message it offers about con - sciousness ; it says that we have entered a time when we can benefi t from the many diverse ways of seeing ourselves and the world, an d that we can use these as a springboard to higher levels of awareness . As human beings, we can truly wake up and evolve into a more con - scious species . The condor people of the Amazon make it seem so obvious that i f we are to address questions about the nature of what it is to be huma n in this new millennium, and about our commitment to evaluatin g our intentions for the next several decades, then we need to open ou r eyes and see the consequences of our actions—the actions of th e eagle — in places like Iraq and Ecuador . We must shake ourselve s awake . We who live in the most powerful nation history has eve r known must stop worrying so much about the outcome of soap op - eras, football games, quarterly balance sheets, and the daily Do w Jones averages, and must instead reevaluate who we are and wher e we want our children to end up . The alternative to stopping to as k ourselves the important questions is simply too dangerous . CHAPTER 3 5 Piercing the Venee r Shortly after I returned home from Ecuador in 2003, the Unite d States invaded Iraq for the second time in a little over a decade . Th e EHMs had failed . The jackals had failed . So young men and wome n were sent to kill and die among the desert sands . One importan t question the invasion raised, but one that I figured few American s would be in a position to consider, was what this would mean for th e royal House of Saud . If the United States took over Iraq, which ac - cording to many estimates has more oil than Saudi Arabia, ther e would seem to be little need to continue honoring the pact we struc k with the Saudi royal family in the 1970s, the deal that originate d with the Saudi Arabian Money-laundering Affair . The end of Saddam, like the end of Noriega in Panama, woul d change the formula . In the case of Panama, once we had reinstate d our puppets, we controlled the Canal, regardless of the terms of th e treaty Torrijos and Carter had negotiated . Once we controlled Iraq , then, could we break OPEC? Would the Saudi royal family becom e irrelevant in the arena of global oil politics? A few pundits were al - ready questioning why Bush attacked Iraq rather than funneling al l of our resources into pursuing al-Qaeda in Afghanistan . Could it b e that from the point of view of this administration — this oil family — establishing oil supplies, as well as a justification for constructio n contracts, was more important than fighting terrorists ? There also was another possible outcome, however ; OPEC migh t attempt to reassert itself . If the United States took control of Iraq , 210 \t Part Iv : 1981-Present \t 211"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"the other petroleum-rich countries might have little to lose by raisin g oil prices and/or reducing supplies . This possibility tied in with an - other scenario, one with implications that would likely occur to fe w people outside the world of higher international finance, yet whic h could tip the scales of the geopolitical balance and ultimately brin g down the system the corporatocracy had worked so hard to con- struct . It could, in fact, turn out to be the single factor that woul d cause history's first truly global empire to self-destruct . In the final analysis, the global empire depends to a large exten t on the fact that the dollar acts as the standard world currency, an d that the United States Mint has the right to print those dollars . Thus , we make loans to countries like Ecuador with the full knowledg e that they will never repay them ; in fact, we do not want them to hono r their debts, since the nonpayment is what gives us our leverage, ou r pound of flesh . Under normal conditions, we would run the risk o f eventually decimating our own funds ; after all, no creditor can af- ford too many defaulted loans . However, ours are not normal cir- cumstances . The United States prints currency that is not backed b y gold . Indeed, it is not backed by anything other than a genera l worldwide confidence in our economy and our ability to marshal th e forces and resources of the empire we have created to support us . The ability to print currency gives us immense power . It means , among other things, that we can continue to make loans that wil l never be repaid — and that we ourselves can accumulate hug e debts . By the beginning of 2003, the United States' national debt ex - ceeded a staggering $6 trillion and was projected to reach $7 trillio n before the end of the year—roughly $24,000 for each U .S . citizen . Much of this debt is owed to Asian countries, particularly to Japa n and China, who purchase U .S . Treasury securities (essentially, IOUs ) with funds accumulated through sales of consumer goods — includin g electronics, computers, automobiles, appliances, and clothing good s — to the United States and the worldwide market s As long as the world accepts the dollar as its standard currency , this excessive debt does not pose a serious obstacle to the corpora- tocracy . However, if another currency should come along to replac e the dollar, and if some of the United States' creditors (Japan o r China, for example) should decide to call in their debts, the situatio n would change drastically . The United States would suddenly fin d itself in a most precarious situation . In fact, today the existence of such a currency is no longer hy- pothetical ; the euro entered the international financial scene o n January 1, 2002 and is growing in prestige and power with ever y passing month . The euro offers an unusual opportunity for OPEC, i f it chooses to retaliate for the Iraq invasion, or if for any other reaso n it decides to flex its muscles against the United States . A decision b y OPEC to substitute the euro for the dollar as its standard currenc y would shake the empire to its very foundations . If that were to hap - pen, and if one or two major creditors were to demand that we repa y our debts in euros, the impact would be enormous . I had these things on my mind on the morning of Good Friday , April 18, 2003, as I walked the short distance from my house to th e converted garage that serves as my office, sat down at the desk , turned on the computer, and as usual, went to the New York Time s Web site . The headline leaped out at me ; it immediately transporte d me from my thoughts about the new realities of international fi- nance, the national debt, and euros back to that of my old profes- sion : \"U .S . Gives Bechtel a Major Contract in Rebuilding Iraq . \" The article stated, \"The Bush administration awarded the Bechte l Group of San Francisco the first major contract today in a vast re - construction plan for Iraq\" Farther down the page, the authors in - formed readers that \"The Iraqis will then work with the World Ban k and the International Monetary Fund, institutions in which th e United States enjoys wide influence, to reshape the country .\" 2 Wide influence! There was an understatement . I linked to another Times article, \"Company Has Ties in Wash- ington, and to Iraq .\" I skipped through the first several paragraphs , which repeated much of the information from the previous article , and came to : Bechtel has longstanding ties to the national securit y establishment . . . One director is George P . Shultz, wh o was secretary of state under President Ronald Reagan . Before joining the Reagan administration, Mr . Shultz , who also serves as a senior counselor to Bechtel, wa s the company ' s president, working alongside Caspar W . Weinberger, who served as an executive at the San Fran - cisco-based company before his appointment as defens e secretary .

Bechtel, to serve on the Presi - dent ' s Export Council . 3 Here in these articles was the story of modern history, the drive t o global empire, in a nutshell . What was going on in Iraq and de - scribed in the morning press was the result of the work Claudine ha d trained me to do some thirty-five years before, and of the work o f other men and women who shared a lust for self-aggrandizemen t not unlike the one I had known . It marked the current point of th e corporatocracy's progress along the road to bringing every person i n the world under its influence . These articles were about the 2003 invasion of Iraq and about th e contracts now being signed, both to rebuild that country from th e wreckage created by our military and to build anew in the mold o f the modern, westernized model . Yet, without saying so, the news o f April 18, 2003, also harked back to the early 1970s and the Saud i Arabian Money-laundering Affair . SAMA and the contracts flowin g out of it had established new and irrevocable precedents that allowe d — indeed mandated — U .S . engineering and construction companie s and the petroleum industry to co-opt the development of a deser t kingdom . In the same mighty blow, SAMA established new rules fo r the global management of petroleum, redefined geopolitics, an d forged with the Saudi royal family an alliance that would ensur e their hegemony as well as their commitment to playing by our rules . As I read those articles, I could not help but wonder how man y other people knew, as I did, that Saddam would still be in charge i f he had played the game as the Saudis had . He would have his mis- siles and chemical plants ; we would have built them for him, an d our people would be in charge of upgrading and servicing them . I t would be a very sweet deal — even as Saudi Arabia had been . Until now, the mainstream media had been careful not to publi- cize this story . But today, here it was . True, it was a mere inkling ; th e articles were only the meekest ghosts of a summary, yet the stor y seemed to be emerging . Wondering if the New York Times was takin g a maverick stance, I visited the CNN Web site and read, \"Bechte l Wins Iraq Contract .\" The CNN story was very similar to the one i n the Times, except it added , Several other companies have at various times bee n reported as possible competitors for the job, either as primary bidders or as parts of teams, including th e Kellogg Brown & Root (KBR) unit of Halliburton Co . — of which Vice President Dick Cheney once was CEO . . . [Already] Halliburton has won a contract, which coul d be worth $7 billion and could last up to two years, t o make emergency repairs to Iraq's oil infrastructure . 4 The story of the march to global empire did indeed appear to b e leaking out . Not the details, not the fact that it was a tragic story o f debt, deception, enslavement, exploitation, and the most blatan t grab in history for the hearts, minds, souls, and resources of peopl e around the world . Nothing in these articles hinted that the story o f Iraq in 2003 was the continuation of a shameful story . Nor did the y disclose that this story, as old as empire, has now taken on new an d terrifying dimensions, both because of its magnitude during thi s time of globalization and because of the subtlety with which it is ex - ecuted . Despite its shortfalls, however, the story did appear to b e leaking out, almost reluctantly . The idea of the reluctant story, leaking out, hit very close to home . It reminded me of my own personal story and of the many years I had postponed telling it . I had known for a very long time that I ha d a confession to make ; still, I postponed making it . Thinking back, I see that my doubts, the whisperings of guilt, were there from the be - ginning . They had started in Claudine's apartment, even before I made the commitment to go to Indonesia on that first trip, and the y had haunted me almost incessantly all these years . I also knew that had the doubts, the pain, and the guilt not con- stantly nagged me, I would never have gotten out . Like so many others , I would have been stuck . I would not have stood on a beach in th e Virgin Islands and decided to quit MAIN . Yet, I was still deferring , just as we as a culture continue to defer . These headlines seemed to hint at the alliance between big cor- porations, international banks, and governments, but like my MAI N resume, the stories barely touched the surface . It was a gloss . Th e real story had little to do with the fact that the major engineerin g and construction firms were once again receiving billions of dollar s to develop a country in our image — among a people who in all like - lihood had no desire to reflect that image — or that an elite band o f 214 \t Part IV : 1981—Present \t Piercing the Veneer 215"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"men was repeating an age-old ritual of abusing the privileges of thei r high government positions . That picture is just too simple . It implies that all we need to do , if we decide to right the wrongs of the system, is to throw these me n out . It feeds into the conspiracy theories and thereby provides a convenient excuse to turn on the TV and forget about it all, comfortabl e in our third-grade view of history, which runs : \" The y \" will take care o f it ; the ship of state is seaworthy and will get nudged back on course . W e may have to wait for the next election, but all will turn out for the best . The real story of modern empire — of the corporatocracy that ex- ploits desperate people and is executing history's most brutal, selfish , and ultimately self-destructive resource-grab — has little to do wit h what was exposed in the newspapers that morning and has every - thing to do with us . And that, of course, explains why we have suc h difficulty listening to the real story We prefer to believe the myt h that thousands of years of human social evolution has finally per- fected the ideal economic system, rather than to face the fact we hav e merely bought into a false concept and accepted it as gospel . We hav e convinced ourselves that all economic growth benefits humankind , and that the greater the growth, the more widespread the benefits . Finally we have persuaded one another that the corollary to thi s concept is valid and morally just : that people who excel at stokin g the fires of economic growth should be exalted and rewarded, whil e those born at the fringes are available for exploitation . This concept and its corollary are used to justify all manner o f piracy—licenses are granted to rape and pillage and murder inno- cent people in Iran, Panama, Colombia, Iraq, and elsewhere . EHMs , jackals, and armies flourish for as long as their activities can b e shown to generate economic growth — and they almost alway s demonstrate such growth . Thanks to the biased \"sciences\" of fore - casting, econometrics, and statistics, if you bomb a city and then re - build it, the data shows a huge spike in economic growth . The real story is that we are living a lie . Like my MAIN resume , we have created a veneer that hides the fatal cancers beneath th e surface . Those cancers are exposed by the X-rays of our statistics , which disclose the terrifying fact that history's most powerful an d wealthiest empire has outrageously high rates of suicide, drug abuse , divorce, child molestation, rape, and murder, and that like a malignant cancer, these afflictions spread their tentacles in an ever-widenin g radius every year . In our hearts, each of us feels the pain . We cry ou t for change . Yet, we slam our fists to our mouths, stifling those cries , and so we go unheard . It would be great if we could just blame it all on a conspiracy but w e cannot . The empire depends on the efficacy of big banks, corporations , and governments —the corporatocracy— but it is not a conspiracy . This corporatocracy is ourselves—we make it happen —which, o f course, is why most of us find it difficult to stand up and oppose it . We would rather glimpse conspirators lurking in the shadows, be - cause most of us work for one of those banks, corporations, or gov- ernments, or in some way are dependent on them for the goods an d services they produce and market . We cannot bring ourselves to bit e the hand of the master who feeds us . That is the situation I was pondering as I sat staring at the head - lines on the screen of my computer . And it raised a number of ques- tions . How do you rise up against a system that appears to provid e you with your home and car, food and clothes, electricity and healt h care — even when you know that the system also creates a worl d where twenty-four thousand people starve to death each day an d millions more hate you, or at least hate the policies made by repre- sentatives you elected? How do you muster the courage to step ou t of line and challenge concepts you and your neighbors have alway s accepted as gospel, even when you suspect that the system is read y to self-destruct? Slowly, I stood up and headed back to the house t o pour myself another cup of coffee . I took a short detour and picked up my copy of the Palm Beac h Post, lying near the mailbox beside our driveway . It had the sam e Bechtel-Iraq article, copyrighted by the New York Times . But now I noticed the date on the masthead : April 18 . It is a famous date, a t least in New England, instilled in me by my Revolutionary War - minded parents and by Longfellow's poem : Listen, my children, and you shall hea r Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere , On the eighteenth of April, in Seventy-five ; Hardly a man is now aliv e Who remembers that famous day and year . 216 \t Part Iv : 1981—Present \t Piercing the Veneer \t 217"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"This year, Good Friday happened to fall on the anniversary o f Paul Revere's ride . Seeing that date on the front page of the Pos t made me think of the colonial silversmith racing his horse throug h the dark streets of New England towns, waving his hat and shouting , \"The British are coming!\" Revere had risked his life to spread th e word, and loyal Americans responded . They stopped the empire , back then . I wondered what had motivated them, why those colonial Amer - icans were willing to step out of line . Many of the ringleaders ha d been prosperous . What had inspired them to risk their businesses, t o bite the hand that fed them, to risk their lives? Each of them un- doubtedly had personal reasons, and yet there must have been som e unifying force, some energy or catalyst, a spark that ignited all thos e individual fires at that single moment in history . And then it came to me : words . The telling of the real story about the British Empire and its selfis h and ultimately self-destructive mercantile system had provided tha t spark . The exposure of the underlying meaning, through the word s of men like Tom Paine and Thomas Jefferson, fired the imagination s of their countrymen, opened hearts and minds . The colonists bega n to question, and when they did, they discovered a new reality tha t cut away at the deceits . They discerned the truth behind the patina , understood the way the British Empire had manipulated, deceived , and enslaved them . They saw that their English masters had formulated a system an d then had managed to convince most people of a lie —that it was th e best system mankind could offer, that the prospects for a bette r world depended on channeling resources through the King of Eng - land, that an imperial approach to commerce and politics was th e most efficient and humane means of helping the majority of the peo - ple — when in fact the truth was that the system enriched only a ver y few at the expense of the many . This lie, and the resulting exploita- tion, endured and expanded for decades, until a handful of philoso- phers, businessmen, farmers, fishermen, frontiersmen, writers, an d orators began to speak the truth . Words . I thought about their power as I refilled my coffee cup , walked back to my office, and returned to the computer . I logged off the CNN Web site and brought up the file I had bee n working on the night before . I read the last paragraph I had written : This story must be told . We live in a time of terrible crisi s — and tremendous opportunity The story of this particula r economic hit man is the story of how we got to where w e are and why we currently face crises that seem insur- mountable . This story must be told because only b y understanding our past mistakes will we be able to tak e advantage of future opportunities . . . . Most importantly , this story must be told because today, for the first time i n history, one nation has the ability, the money, and th e power to change all this . It is the nation where I was bor n and the one I served as an EHM : the United States o f America . This time I would not stop . The coincidences of my life and th e choices I had made around them had brought me to this point . I would move forward . I thought again of that other man, that lone rider gallopin g through the dark New England countryside, shouting out his warn- ing . The silversmith knew that the words of Paine had preceded him , that people had read those words in their homes and discussed the m in the taverns . Paine had pointed out the truth about the tyranny o f the British Empire . Jefferson would proclaim that our nation wa s dedicated to the principles of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happi- ness . And Revere, riding through the night, understood that me n and women throughout the colonies would be empowered by thos e words ; they would rise up and fight for a better world . Words . . . I made my decision to stop procrastinating, to finish finally wha t I had started so many times over all those years, to come clean, t o confess — to write the words in this book . 218 \t Part Iv : 1981-Present \t Piercing the Veneer 219"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"a : : EPILOGU E We have arrived at the end of this book, and also at a beginning . Yo u are probably wondering where to go next, what you can do to sto p the corporatocracy and to end this insane and self-destructive marc h to global empire . You are ready to leave the book behind and pounc e on the world . You want ideas, and I could offer you some . I could point out that the chapter you just read, about Bechte l and Halliburton in Iraq, is old news . By the time you read it, it ma y seem redundant . However, the significance of those newspaper ar- ticles goes far beyond the timeliness of their content . That chapter , I hope, will change the way you view the news, help you to rea d between the lines of every newspaper article that comes before yo u and to question the deeper implications of every radio and televisio n report you tune in to . Things are not as they appear . NBC is owned by General Electric , ABC by Disney, CBS by Viacom, and CNN is part of the huge AO L Time Warner conglomerate . Most of our newspapers, magazines , and publishing houses are owned — and manipulated —by giganti c international corporations . Our media is part of the corporatocracy . The officers and directors who control nearly all our communica- tions outlets know their places ; they are taught throughout life tha t one of their most important jobs is to perpetuate, strengthen, an d expand the system they have inherited . They are very efficient at do - ing so, and when opposed, they can be ruthless . So the burden fall s on you to see the truth beneath the veneer and to expose it . Speak i t to your family and friends ; spread the word . I could give you a list of practical things to do . For instance, cu t back on your oil consumption . In 1990, before we first invaded Iraq , we imported 8 million barrels of oil ; by 2003 and the second inva- sion, this had increased more than 50 percent, to over 12 millio n barrels .' The next time you are tempted to go shopping, read a boo k instead, exercise, or meditate . Downsize your home, wardrobe, car , office, and most everything else in your life . Protest against \"free \" 221"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"trade agreements and against companies that exploit desperat e people in sweatshops or that pillage the environment . I could tell you that there is great hope within the current system , that there is nothing inherently wrong with banks, corporations, an d governments — or with the people who manage them — and tha t they certainly do not have to compose a corporatocracy . I could g o into detail about how the problems confronting us today are not th e result of malicious institutions ; rather, they stem from fallaciou s concepts about economic development . The fault lies not in the insti - tutions themselves, but in our perceptions of the manner in whic h they function and interact with one another, and of the role thei r managers play in that process . In fact, those highly effective worldwide communications an d distribution networks could be used to bring about positive an d compassionate changes . Imagine if the Nike swoosh, MacDonald' s arches, and Coca-Cola logo became symbols of companies whos e primary goals were to clothe and feed the world's poor in environ - mentally beneficial ways . This is no more unrealistic than putting a man on the moon, breaking up the Soviet Union, or creating the in - frastructure that allows those companies to reach every corner of th e planet . We need a revolution in our approach to education, to em - power ourselves and our children to think, to question, and to dar e to act . You can set an example . Be a teacher and a student ; inspir e everyone around you through your example . I could encourage you to take specific actions that will impact th e institutions in your life . Speak out whenever any forum presents itself , write letters and e-mails, phone in questions and concerns, vot e for enlightened school boards, county commissions, and local ordi - nances . When you must shop, do it consciously ; get personally involved . I could remind you of what the Shuars told me in 1990, that th e world is as you dream it, and that we can trade in that old nightmar e of polluting industries, clogged highways, and overcrowded cities fo r a new dream based on Earth-honoring and socially responsible prin - ciples of sustainability and equality . It is within our power to trans - form ourselves, to change the paradigm . I could enumerate the amazing opportunities we have availabl e to us for creating a better world, right now : enough food and water fo r everyone ; medicines to cure diseases and to prevent epidemics tha t needlessly plague millions of people today ; transportation systems that can deliver life ' s essentials to even the most remote corners o f the planet ; the ability to raise literacy levels and to provide Interne t services that could make it possible for every person on the planet t o communicate with every other person ; tools for conflict resolutio n that could render wars obsolete ; technologies that explore both th e vastness of space and the most minute, subatomic energy, whic h could then be applied to developing more ecologic and efficien t homes for everyone ; sufficient resources to accomplish all of th e above ; and much more . I could suggest steps for you to take immediately, to help other s understand the crises and the opportunities . • Offer study groups about Confessions of an Economic Hit Ma n at your local bookstore or library, or both (a guideline for doin g this is available at www .JohnPerkins .org) . • Develop a presentation for a nearby elementary school on you r favorite subject (sports, cooking, ants — almost anything), an d use it to help students wake up to the true nature of the societ y they are inheriting . • Send e-mails to all the addresses in your file, expressing feeling s triggered by this and other books you read . But I suspect you have already thought of most of these things . You just need to pick a couple that most appeal to you and do them , and to realize that all of these are part of a much greater commitmen t that you and I must make . We must commit ourselves absolutel y and unequivocally to shaking ourselves and everyone around u s awake . We must hear the wisdom of the prophecies, open our heart s and minds to the possibilities, become conscious, and then take action . However, this book is not a prescription ; it is a confession, pur e and simple . It is the confession of a man who allowed himself to be - come a pawn, an economic hit man ; a man who bought into a cor- rupt system because it offered so many perks, and because buying i n was easy to justify ; a man who knew better but who could alway s find excuses for his own greed, for exploiting desperate people an d pillaging the planet ; a man who took full advantage of the fact tha t he was born into one of the wealthiest societies history has eve r known, and who also could pity himself because his parents wer e not at the top of the pyramid ; a man who listened to his teachers , 222 \t Confessions of an Economic Hit man \t Epilogue 223"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"read the textbooks on economic development, and then followed th e example of other men and women who legitimatize every action tha t promotes global empire, even if that action results in murder, geno- cide, and environmental destruction ; a man who trained others t o follow in his footsteps .

It may b e nothing less than euphoric . Believe me when I say that writing this book has been deepl y emotional, and often a painful and humiliating experience . It ha s been frightening in a way nothing I ever faced before has bee n frightening . But it has opened me to a sense of relief I have neve r known until now, a feeling I can only describe as ecstatic . Ask yourself these questions . What do I need to confess? Ho w have I deceived myself and others? Where have I deferred? Wh y have I allowed myself to be sucked into a system that I know is un - balanced? What will I do to make sure our children, and all childre n everywhere, are able to fulfill the dream of our Founding Fathers, th e dream of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness? What course wil l I take to end the needless starvation, and make sure there is neve r again a day like September 11? How can I help our children under - stand that people who live gluttonous, unbalanced lives should b e pitied but never, ever emulated, even if those people present them - selves, through the media they control, as cultural icons and try t o convince us that penthouses and yachts bring happiness? Wha t changes will I commit to making in my attitudes and perceptions ? What forums will I use to teach others and to learn more on my own ? These are the essential questions of our time . Each of us need s to answer them in our own way and to express our answers clearly, unequivocally . Paine and Jefferson and all the other patriots ar e watching over our shoulders . Their words continue to inspire us to - day . The spirits of those men and women who left their farms an d fishing boats and headed out to confront the mighty British Empire , and of those who fought to emancipate the slaves during the Civi l War, and of those who sacrificed their lives to protect the world fro m fascism, speak to us . As do the spirits of the ones who stayed at hom e and produced the food and clothes and gave their moral support , and of all the men and women who have defended what was won o n those battlefields : the teachers, poets, artists, entrepreneurs, healt h workers, the manual laborers . . . you and me . The hour is ours . It is now time for each and every one of us t o step up to the battle line, to ask the important questions, to searc h our souls for our own answers, and to take action .

As an EHM, John's job was to con v ince third world countries t o accept enormous loans for infrastructure development —loans tha t were much larger than needed — and to guarantee that the develop- ment projects were contracted to U .S . corporations like Halliburto n and Bechtel . Once these countries were saddled with huge debts, th e U .S . government and the international aid agencies allied with i t were able to control these economies and to ensure that oil an d other resources were channeled to serve the interests of building a global empire . In his EHM capacity, John traveled all over the world and wa s either a direct participant in or a witness to some of the most dra- matic events in modern history, including the Saudi Arabian Money - laundering Affair, the fall of the shah of Iran, the death of Panama' s President Omar Torrijos, the subsequent invasion of Panama, an d events leading up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq . In 1980, Perkins founded Independent Power Systems, Inc . (IPS) , an alternative energy company . Under his leadership as CEO, IP S became an extremely successful firm in a high-risk business wher e most of his competitors failed . Many \"coincidences\" and favors fro m people in powerful positions helped make IPS an industry leader . John also served as a highly paid consultant to some of the corpora - tions whose pockets he had previously helped to line — taking on this role partly in response to a series of not-so-veiled threats and lucra - tive payoffs . After selling IPS in 1990, John became a champion for indigenou s rights and en v ironmental movements, working especially closel y with Amazon tribes to help them preserve their rain forests . H e wrote five books, published in many languages, about indigenou s cultures, shamanism, ecology, and sustainability ; taught at universitie s and learning centers on four continents ; and founded and served o n the board of directors of several leading nonprofit organizations . One of the nonprofit organizations he founded and chaired , Dream Change Coalition (later simply Dream Change, or DC), be - came a model for inspiring people to attain their personal goals and , at the same time, to be more conscious of the impacts their lives hav e on others and on the planet . DC seeks to empower individuals t o create more balanced and sustainable communities . DC's Pollutio n Offset Lease for Earth (POLE) program offsets the atmospheric pol - lution we each create, helps indigenous people preserve their forests , and promotes earth-honoring changes in consciousness . DC has de - veloped a following around the world and has inspired people i n many countries to form organizations with similar missions . 248 \t About the Author 249"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"During the 1990s and into the new millennium, John honore d his vow of silence about his EHM life and continued to receive lu- crative corporate consulting fees . He assuaged his guilt by applyin g to his nonprofit work much of the money he earned as a consultant . Arts & Entertainment television featured him in a special title d \"Headhunters of the Amazon,\" narrated by Leonard Nimoy . Italia n Cosmopolitan ran a major article on his \"Shapeshifting\" workshop s in Europe . TIME magazine selected Dream Change as one of th e thirteen organizations in the world whose Web sites best reflect th e ideals and goals of Earth Day . Then came September 11, 2001 . The terrible events of that da y convinced John to drop the veil of secrecy around his life as a n EHM, to ignore the threats and bribes, and to write Confessions o f an Economic Hit Man . He came to believe in his responsibility t o share his insider knowledge about the role the U .S . government , multinational \"aid\" organizations, and corporations have played i n bringing the world to a place where such an event could occur . H e wanted to expose the fact that EHMs are more ubiquitous today tha n ever before . He felt he owed this to his country, to his daughter, to al l the people around the world who suffer because of the work he an d his peers have done, and to himself . In this book, he outlines th e dangerous path his country is taking as it moves away from th e original ideals of the American republic and toward a quest fo r global empire .
