[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"BRITAIN'S INTERNATIONAL ASSASSINATION BUREAU: PERMINDEX During the spring, summer and autumn months of 1963, a series of top secret conspiratorial meetings took place behind well-guarded closed doors at an exclusive resort spot at Montego Bay on the Caribbean island of Jamaica. The location for those meetings was the Tryall Compound, built at the close of World War II by Britain's highest ranking secret espionage agent, Sir William Stephenson. Nominally a \"retirement colony,\" Tryall was to serve as the command center for Her Majesty's ongoing secret war against the United States, a war measured in tons of heroin, cocaine, and marijuana crammed into the pores of America's youth. In the spirng of 1963, an only somewhat different sort of conspiratorial gathering was occupying the facilities at Tryall. Present at various times for the planning sessions were: Major Louis Mortimer Bloomfield, in 1963 still a top officer in Sir William Stephenson's British Special Operations Executive (SOE); Ferenc Nagy, a wartime cabinet minister in the pro- Hitler Horthy government of Hungary and later its Prime Minister; Georgio Mantello, a Roumanian-born Jew who had served as a trade minister under Mussolini; Colonel Clay Shaw, a former officer in the U.S. Office of Strategic Services (OSS) who in 1963 was the director of the New Orleans International Trade Mart; Jean DeMenil, a White Russian emigre who at that moment was the President of the Houston-based Schlumberger Corporation, a heavy equipment manufacturer frequently used as a covert conduit for weapons; Paul Raigor-odsky, another White Russian active in the rightwing Solidarist movement. Other individuals figured in the plot; however, the above group constituted the witting operational core. The purpose of the meetings was to plot the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in Dallas, Texas on November 22, 1963. What sort of glue held these individuals together? What common motives drove them to execute the most horrible political assassination of the century? What vast capability stood behind these relatively unknown individuals and enabled them to both execute and cover up their crimes for nearly two decades? The answer to all these questions begins with an obscure international trading exposition company incorporated in Switzerland and housed in Montreal. The name of the company is Permindex (\"Permanent Industrial Expositions\"). Its president and chairman of the board since its inception in 1958 has been Major Louis Mortimer Bloomfield. All of the"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Permindex 2 individuals present at the Tryall Compound for the Kennedy assassination plotting were, at the time, board members, officers and investors in Permindex. Each of these individuals was also a longstanding trusted asset of the British SOE. Unlike any other trade expositions company in the world, the employees and investors in Permindex had all been selected for specific operational capabilities that they represented; capabilities that would be indispensible to the conducting of high-level political assassinations. As we delve into the Permindex international assassination bureau and discover the suppressed facts behind the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, we shall encounter three capabilities in particular that are already familiar to us as Dope, Inc. First, we shall encounter an international web of dirty money outfits, responsible for channeling millions of dollars in black market revenues into the hands of the professional killers deployed on behalf of Permindex and its SOE control. Not surprisingly, we shall discover that these dirty money channels are hard-wired into the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation-centered apparatus that launders the $200 billion in annual revenues from illegal drug sales. Second, we shall discover an international band of protected killers, drawn from the ranks of the Nazi and fascist gestapos of World War II; from the street level crime syndicate responsible for the retail distribution of narcotics; and from a secret capability established by the Stephenson organization at the outset of World War II, operating under the cover of missionary activity in Latin America and the East bloc. Their missions? Political assassinations employing high-powered rifles at a distance of 1,000 yards. Third, we shall encounter a British SOE fifth column embedded deeploy into the American official intelligence community. This fifth column, linked directly to Permindex and its chairman Major Bloomfield, represents perhaps the single most crucial component of the international assassination bureau: its coverup capability. Seventeen years after the assassination of John F. Kennedy, Permindex remains one of the best kept secrets in the worldâ€”despite the fact that it has been exposed on more than one occasion as the agency behind high-level political exterminations touching on top political officials of no fewer than three sovereign nations."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Permindex 3 Louis Mortimer Bloomfield At the time of the Kennedy assassination, Major Louis Mortimer Bloomfield was acting on behalf of his superiors in the British Special Operations Executive, including \"retired\" chief Sir William Stephenson, at that time a permanent resident of the Tyrall Compound on Montego Bay, Jamaica. As president and chairman of the board of Permindex, Bloomfield was the designated chief operations officer for the Kennedy hit. Who is Louis Mortimer Bloomfield and what had brought him to the point of becoming, by 1963, the unofficial successor to Stephenson as Her Majesty's top secret agent in North America; the man entrusted to carry out the execution of John F. Kennedy, the American president who dared to violate the \"special relationship\" with the British Crown? Louis Mortimer Bloomfield was recruited into the SOE in 1938, the year that Stephenson, acting as personal emmissary of Winston Churchill, negotiated an agreement with U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt allowing British intelligence to set up shop in the United States and to effectively merge its operations with those of the FBI and military intelligence. Under SOE commission, Bloomfield was given an officer's rank in the U.S. Army and assigned to the newly created Office of Strategic Services (OSS), the wartime predecessor to the Central Intelligence Agency. As a Major in the OSS, Bloomfield was detailed into the Federal Bureau of Investigation as the contracting (recruitment) agent for its counterespionage Division Five. Bloomfield, described by numerous authors and associates as a practicing homosexual, developed a deeply personal friendship with FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover. Through that relationship, Bloomfield was able to retain his powerful position within Division Five long after the end of the war. As late as 1963, when Bloomfield was case officering the assassination plot against John F. Kennedy, he was still a top official in Division Five. When the SOE \"formally\" dissolved its U.S. operations at the close of World War II, Bloomfield returned to Montreal, Canada to resume his career as a prominent attorney. He had been a founding partner in the prestigious Hofjuden law firm of Phillips, Vineberg, Bloomfield and Goodman, the firm that represents and controls the Bronfman family's holdings. Bloomfield's name was only removed from the firm's letterhead in 1968 after French President Charles de Gaulle publicly exposed the role of Bloomfield's Permindex company in acting as a conduit for funds into the Secret Army Organization (OAS) to finance the 1962 assassination attempt against him. Such cosmetic gestures, however, have little significance in the murky world of Canadian politics, where the most"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Permindex 4 prestigious names all appear on the board of directors of Dope, Inc. From the outset, the British SOE had made it a point of operating through commercial fronts. Thus, for example, Stephenson set up the SOE command center in the United States in the Radio Corporation of America building in New York City's Rockefeller Center under the sign of an importing-exporting company. Montreal attorney and SOE operative Bloomfield created a nest of corporate entities following his return to Canada, all of which served as vehicles for ongoing SOE activity. Among Bloomfield's corporate holdings were the Israeli Continental Corporation, the Canadian subsidiary of the Dutch Heinekens Breweries and Credit Suisse of Canada, a correspondent bank to the Credit Suisse of Geneva that was among the holding companies exposed by General de Gaulle's intelligence bureau SDECE as a laundering point for hit money into the OAS. All of these companies would later be listed as investors in Permindex. Like his law partner Lazarus Phillips and his former \"clients\" the Bronfmans, Bloomfield also established himself at the top of the Zionist movement in Canada. Among his numerous honorary positions, Bloomfield is the annual chairman of the Histadrut campaign of Canada. No ordinary charity, the Histadrut owns over one-third of the gross national product of Israel; controls the second largest bank in Israel, the Bank Hapoalim; and has been caught on more than one occasion laundering money into overseas operations of the Israeli secret service, the Mossad. Some of those funds passed directly back into Major Bloomfield's Permindex were used also to bankroll unsuccessful hit attempts against de Gaulle. Among Bloomfield's other \"charitable\" activities is his chairmanship of the Canadian Red Cross Ambulance Service, a position traditionally held by a top- ranking Knight in the Queen's official chivalric order, the Most Venerable Military and Hospitaller Order of St. John of Jerusalem. As an operating arm of the sovereign Order, the Red Cross ambulance service is an official intelligence arm of the British Monarchy, frequently called upon to carry out espionage and terrorist activities. In addition to his corporate and \"charitable\" activities within his native Canada and his continuing post within Hoover's FBI Division Five, Major Bloomfield was given special responsibility following the war to develop the international network of clandestine shipping routes that would be essential to the planned skyrocketing of narcotics traffic, dirty money and related blackmarketeering."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Permindex 5 First, Bloomfield assumed the directorship of the Israeli-Canadian Maritime League, a trade association whose significance will become clear shortly. Simultaneously, he became the Consul-General in charge of the Western Hemisphere of the African state of Liberia. Liberia is a notorious tax shelter and smugglers' port of call. With no shipping regulations, Liberiaâ€”under Bloomfield's consularshipâ€”became the flag of convenience under which a sizeable portion of the ships bearing bulk cargos of Far East narcotics are registered. Liberia is also one of the secondary offshore banking centers employed by the directorate of Dope, Inc. The unregulated \"banks\" of Liberia account for $7 billion in average daily transfersâ€”the vast majority of which are related to black market transfers. The only other foreign-stationed Consul-General for Liberia is Bloomfield- Permindex associate and former Israeli Mossad official Dr. Tibor Rosenbaum, whom we shall meet shortly. One final deployment in the immediate postwar period by the SOE's Major Bloomfield would set the stage for the future emergence of the assassination bureau, Permindex. In 19 52, Bloomfield became a ranking official of the United Nations Organization; one of its leading advisers on international law. Bloomfield accomplished this by assuming a position as Overseas Representative of the International Executive Board of the International Law Association. Established in 1873, the International Law Association had from its inception been an arm of Lord Milner's Round Table group responsible for developing a code of law compatible with the \"one world\" designs of Britain's leading oligarchical families. After World War II, the ILA became an officially recognized Non-Governmental Organization of the UNO and its principle advisory body on all matters of international law. Major Bloomfield's particular area of \"expertise\" on behalf of the UNO was, naturally: international terrorism, piracy and civil aviation. In fact, to this day, the United Nations' International Civil Aviation Commission is housed in Montreal where it is presided over by one of Major Bloomfield's closest collaborators, Gerald Fitzgerald. Fitzgerald, on advisement from Bloomfield, has drafted every United Nations convention on hijacking, piracy and terrorism. In 1962, on the eve of Permindex's first major political assassination, Fitzgerald and Major Bloomfield co-authored a history of political assassinations in the twentieth century, focusing particularly on the activities of the Zionist clandestine army, the Irgun, and its 1940s murder plots against Britain's Count Bernadotte and Lord Moyne. 1958. Better than ten years have passed since Major Bloomfield's \"official\" retirement from the SOE-OSS and his"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Permindex 6 return to his native country, Canada. Sufficient distance has been created from his past activities as a master spy within Ker Majesty's most secret spy army to warrant Major Bloomfield a place on the list of \"citizens above suspicion.\" And so, in 19 58, on orders from his superiors at Montego Bay, Bloomfield created Permindex and its international subsidiaries Centro Mondiale and the Italo- American Hotel Corporation to house an international assassination bureau. The Board of Directors At the outset of this chapter on Dope, Inc.'s International Assassination Bureau, we looked in on the behind-closed-doors sessions at Tryall in which the Kennedy assassination was planned out. At that time, we were introduced to several members of the board of Permindex. It is worth briefly returning to that board of directors roster to get a closer glimpse of the sorts of individuals recruited by chief of operations Major Bloomfield to carry out the most hideous crimes of the century. According to corporate records on file in Berne, Switzerland, the following individuals were officially listed as officers and board members of Permindex at the time of its incorporation by Major Bloomfield. â€”Louis Mortimer Bloomfield, President and Chairman of the Board; â€”Ferenc Nagy â€”Georgio Mantello â€”Roy Marcus Cohn, attorney, Nev; York City; former general counsel to Senator Joseph McCarthy; chairman, American Jewish League Against Communism; President, Lionel Corporation; â€”Joseph Bonnano, syndicate boss of Montreal and Phoenix; Chairman of the Board, Lionel Corporation; â€”Major General John Bruce Medaris, former director, Defense Industrial Security Command; Board of Directors, Lionel Corporation; â€”Jean DeMenil â€”Paul Raigorodsky â€”Prince Guitierez di Spadafora, former Undersecretary of Agriculture to Mussolini; sponsor of the Sicilian Separatist Movement;"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Permindex 7 â€”Hans Seligman, banker, Basel, Switzerland; â€”Carlo D'Amelio, attorney, Rome, representing the financial holdings of the House of Savoy and the House of Pallavicini; attorney for \"Circolo Rex\"; general counsel Centro Mondiale Commerciale; â€”Max Hageman, editor, Munich, National Seitung (neo-Nazi publication); â€”Munir Chourbagi, uncle of King Farouk of Egypt; â€”Giuseppe Zigiotti, head of the Italian political party Fascist National Association for Militia Arms; â€”Ferenc H. Simonfay, former Nazi collaborator in Hungary; leader of the Solidarist movement; â€”Colonel Clay Shaw Every one of these individuals represented a decade long asset of the British SOE, called into active service for a very specific role in a very specific series of operations. Bankrolling an Assassination In 1967, the French Intelligence Bureau SDECE released the results of a five year investigation into the 1962 aborted assassination attempt against General de Gaulle, carried out by the rabidly rightwing Secret Army Organization (OAS). While the SDECE report traced the origins of the assassination plot to the Brussels headquarters of NATO and to a specific group of disgruntled French and British Generals as well as the remnants of the old Nazi intelligence apparatus, it also singled out Major Bloomfield's Permindex trading company as the agency responsible for conduiting $200,000 into the OAS to bankroll the attempt. The source of the funds was FBI Division Five, the secret counterespionage branch of Hoover's agency that was run out of the Montreal, Canada law offices of Major Bloomfield. As the result of the de Gaulle expose of Permindex's role in the OAS hit squads, Permindex was forced to shut down its public operations in Western Europe and relocate its headquarters to Johannesberg, South Africa. As a related feature of the de Gaulle crackdown, Israel's overseas intelligence branch, the Mossad, was kicked out of France. We have already noted that Permindex's Major Bloom-field established himself as one of the leading Zionists in Canada and had extended that \"charitable\" activity to a prosperous business relationship extending into international"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Permindex 8 shipping and banking. We shall now see that Bloomfield's efforts \"on behalf of Israel\" represented an extension of British SOE penetration and control over sections of the Israeli secret service and that this control constituted one of the important capabilities that were consolidated with the 1958 creation of Permindex. In the course of unraveling this piece of the Permindex web, we shall encounter those operatives within the international assassination bureau designated with the responsibility of providing the laundered millions of dollars for the financing of political violence. We begin with Basel banker Hans Seligman. According to a suppressed manuscript on the Permindex assassination cabal, the Seligman Bank of Basel, Switzerland was a subsidiary of Permindex responsible for laundering funds into Major Bloomfield's various operations; one of a dozen such subsidiaries of the Montreal trade expositions company. Hans Seligman is the last remaining European-based member of the Seligman family that made its vast fortune in the United States during the 19th century, first in dry goods and later in banking. The Seligman family of New York was one of the \"Our Crowd\" group that turned its experience in retailing dry goods into a lucrative black market in booze following the passage of the Eighteenth Amendment. Like the DeHirsh family, the Seligmans originated in Bavaria as part of the Hofjuden entourage built up around the Wittelsbach and Hapsburg courts. It was in fact the joint efforts of the DeHirsh and Seligman families that led to the founding of the DeHirsh Foundation and the Jewish Colonization Association, the agencies responsible for transplanting the likes of Yechiel Bronfman to Canada as an indentured servant. At the time of the Bronfman migration, the DeHirsh Foundation was being run out of New York City by Jesse Seligman. By 1890s, the Seligman, DeHirsh and Gunzberg Zionist interests merged with the Louis-Dreyfus family interests. Today all four families share control over the Bank Louis-Dreyfus. As we have seen in earlier chapters. Bank Louis-Dreyfu maintains financial control over the Bronfman family holdings, one of the important fronts for the channeling of the revenues of Dope, Inc. Hans Seligman's placement on the board of Permindex, headed by \"former\" Bronfman family attorney and financial adviser Bloomfield, constitutes one closed circle through which drug revenues can be passed to finance the activities of Permindex. In addition to the Seligman Bank of Basel, the suppressed Permindex document, authored by \"William Torbitt\" (an apparent pseudonym), lists a number of additional banking entities"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Permindex 9 wholly owned by Permindex. These include: Astaldo Vaduz of Miami, De Famaco Vaduz of Lichtenstein and De Famaco Astaldo Vaduz of Geneva. These entities appear to have amounted to little more than post office boxes serving as money drops in locations where virtually non-existent banking laws facilitiated such blind passes. As noted above, Bloomfield ran the Canadian subsidiary of Credit Suisse, a far more formidable banking institution with deep ties into financial circuitry behind Dope, Inc. But the largest and most formidable banking entity in the Permindex family was the Banque de la Credit Internationale (BCI) of Basel, Switzerland, which remained in business until 1974. Dr. Tibor Rosenbaum, BCI and Permindex BCI was the creation of Dr. Tibor Rosenbaum, a Hungarian born Jew who migrated to Palestine under the sponsorship of the Jewish Agency. Back in Hungary, Rosenbaum had been associated with Dr. Rudolph Kastner, whose activities as a personal collaborator of Adolph Eichmann in sending an estimated 800,000 Jews of Eastern Europe to the gas chambers at Auschwitz created a major scandal in Israel in the early 1950s and served as the basis for Ben Hecht's famous suppressed book Perfidy . Following Israel's statehood, Tibor Rosenbaum was appointed the first Minister of Supply and Finance for the foreign intelligence branch, the Mossad. In 1951, Rosenbaum was deployed to Geneva, ostensibly as the Director of Israeli Migration, holding full diplomatic papers. In as much as there was no migration from Switzerland to Israel during this period, speculation that Rosenbaum was already involved in setting up funds-laundering operations on behalf of the Mossad is well founded. According to a recently published book-length expose of the Israeli mafia by L'Express journalist Jacques Derogy, Rosenbaum traded his Israeli diplomatic papers for Liberian documents in the mid-1950s on the eve of his launching the Banque de la Credit Internationale. Rosenbaum incorporated the BCI in 1958, the same year that his fellow \"Liberian diplomat\" Major Louis Mortimer Bloomfield established Permindex. According to Derogy, Dr. Rosenbaum was designated as the \"Swiss connection\" in an international money laundering apparatus to facilitate the diamond-for-dope trade that was"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Permindex 10 to make up an increasingly larger share of the foreign trade of Israel. Despite the cosmetic cover provided to Rosenbaum's operations by his Liberian papers, his Banque de la Credit Internationale was so deeply meshed with Israeli high finance and bigtime politics that when the scandal broke in Israel in the early 1970s over Rosenbaum's dirty money operations, Israeli Finance Minister Pinchas Sapir immediately resigned, creating a government crisis. What can be said about Rosenbaum's Swiss laundering operations and how did his BCI intersect the operations of Major Bloomfield's Permindex? According to a 1967 Life magazine expose, Rosenbaum's Banque de la Credit Internationale was on the receiving end of $10 million in illegal funds, laundered through the World Commerce Bank of Nassau, Grand Bahamas. The Nassau bank was a joint venture of North American syndicate kingpin Meyer Lansky and several of his closest associates in the gambling, smuggling, extortion and dirty money rackets. The World Commerce Bank was managed by Lansky accountant Alvin Malnick. Another official of the Nassau laundering hole was a Swiss national and well-known Lansky bagman, Sylvain Ferdman. According to the Life magazine investigators, Ferdman was simultaneously listed as the chief operations officer of Rosenbaum's BCI. The picture of BCI, however, remains incomplete without the inclusion of yet another board member of Dr. Rosenbaum's Swiss establishment: Ernest Israel Japhet. Japhet's presence on the board of directors of the Banque de la Credit Internationale brings us full circle back to the London boardrooms of the Big Five commercial banks that command the international narcotics cartel top down. Who is Ernest Israel Japhet, in addition to being a board member of the BCI, an entity servicing the black market money needs of the Mossad, the Israeli mafia and the \"wizard\" of North American syndicate financing, Meyer Lansky? Japhet is the chairman and president of the Bank Leumi, the largest bank in Israel; a bank that we have already identified as a critical component of the diamond-for-dope traffic into Hong Kong. The current heir of a German Hofjuden banking family that traces its roots back centuries, Japhet recently sold the family's trading company to the Quaker Barclays Bank of London which in turn placed him on the board of directors of its thus created subsidiary Charterhouse- Japhet. Charterhouse-Japhet, like the Japhet Company before it, deals exclusively in the diamond trade between Israel and Hong Kongâ€”trading those precious stones for the same Golden Triangle opium that launched the Japhet family's career in international finance 150 years ago."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Permindex 11 Joining Japhet as a trustee of the Bank Leumi is Baron Stormont Bancroft, a member of the Hofjuden Samuel family, a former Lord-in-Waiting to the Queen of England and the Deputy Chairman of Cunard Lines, a shipping company strongly suspected of shipping large volumes of Far East heroin over its Asian and Mediterranean routes. Bank Leumi further keeps its hands in the drug trade through its 100 percent owned subsidiary Union Bank. Ernest Israel Japhet is the chairman of Union Bank, which handles over one third of the world's financing in diamonds. Bank Leumi is not the only Israeli bank to heavily interface its operations with the Geneva laundering hole of Dr. Rosenbaum. Even more heavily involved in the BCI is the Bank Hapoalim. The second largest bank in Israel, Bank Hapoalim was founded as an offshoot of the Jewish Agency. Its founder and present board director, British High Commissioner Viscount Erwin Herbert Samuel, belongs to the same Samuel family behind the Bank Leumi and the Cunard Lines. Viscount Samuel presides as head of the Israel Red Cross, an official branch of the Most Venerable Military and Hospitaller Order of St. John of Jerusalemâ€”the same order held by Major Louis Mortimer Bloomfield of Permindex. According to the already cited Derogy expose of the Israeli mafia, the Bank Hapoalim figured prominently in the same diamonds-for-dope apparatus. Illegal revenues from the diamond-for-dope exchange run between Israel and the Golden Triangle banks of Thailand would be initially deposited in an escrow account in London, for transfer to protected accounts in Johannesburg, South Africa. From South Africa, the same funds would be laundered through the Bank Hapoalim into Dr. Rosenbaum's BCI. The \"South African connection\" for this diamonds-for-dope operation, according to author Derogy, was Zwy Peerâ€”the Israeli director of the Investors Overseas Service (IOS). IOS, until its demise in 1975, was indistinguishable from the Banque de la Credit Internationale. Nominally an international mutual fund founded by Bernie Cornfeld, and eventually taken over by Robert Vesco, IOS in reality was a lundering service deploying a virtual army of \"salesmen\" in every corner of the globe, often carrying phenomenal volumes of cash which the IOS directors claimed were the investment deposits of thousands of small investors. These investors for the most part remained anonymous. According to author Hank Messick, a significant number of the so-called small investors were local operatives of the Meyer Lansky-Israeli mafia apparatus. The convergence of the drug syndicate and the intelligence"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Permindex 12 services of Great Britain and Israel in the person of Dr. Tibor Rosenbaum is further amplified by a brief look at the Swiss-based banker's other major financial holding, the Swiss-Israel Trade Bank of Geneva. Among its principal holdings, the Swiss-Israel Trade Bank owns one third interest in the Paz conglomerate. Owned until the early 1950's by the Rothschild family, the Paz group of corporations maintains a virtual monopoly over the Israeli oil and pertrochemical industry, including the vital shipping lines transporting oil and petrochemicals in and out of the Middle East. In 1978, police authorities in New York City siezed a Paz ship as it attempted entry into New York harbor. Police found its hold to be loaded with liquid hashish. Sharing the Paz ownership with Dr. Rosenbaum's Swiss-Israel entity are Max Fisher, a Detroit, Michigan based \"businessman-philanthropist\" about whom we shall learn a great deal more in a later chapter; and Sir Isaac Wolfson, a London department store magnate whose family traces its lineage back to the 13th century. It was Wolfson whose family mantle provided prestige for the Paz group following its sale by the Rothschild interests. Sir Isaac was the chairman of the British Board of Jewish Deputies, the most prestigious and powerful Zionist organization in the British Empire. His son today is the chief policy advisor to British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. The Swiss-Israel Trade Bank, the third owner of Paz, is a virtual who's who of the combined British SOE-Israeli Mossad apparatus, beginnings with the already identified Dr. Tibor Rosenbaum. The manager of the Swiss-Israel Trade Bank up until his recent semi- retirement was General Julius Klein. We shall encounter General Klein on several occasions as we unravel the complex web of front companies, offshore banks and official government services that together comprised the Permindex International Assassination Bureau. As early as 1922, following his service as a U.S. Army Counterintelligence officer during World War I, Klein was picked up by Sir William Wiseman, then head of all British intelligence operations in the United States and later a neighbor of Sir William Stephenson at the Tryall Compound on Montego Bay, Jamaica. Under Wiseman's instructions, Klein was brought onto the staff of Colonel House, the special advisor to President Woodrow Wilson who led the U.S. negotiating team at the Versaille Treaty negotiations. The Presidential advisor was a neighbor of the British spook, and House rarely made a serious political decision without first consulting Wiseman. By 1932, the young Klein was on the inside track of the Anglo-American intelligence establishment. In that year he was appointed director of the first antisubversive section established in the U.S. Department of Justice. This appointment brought Klein into close working relationship with FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover and particularly with the Division Five section. In 1938, Klein's operations, for all intents and purposes, became a subordinate feature of the British Special Operations Executive. In addition to his Justice Department antisubversive role, Klein that year founded the Jewish War Veterans, the first of several private organizations that he would create as recruiting grounds and intelligence fronts for Stephenson's SOE."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Permindex 15 Sir William Stephenson's access to the intelligence facilities of the Zionist movement in the United States and Canada was greatly facilitated by the fact that from 1922, he had employed Chaim Weitzman as his principal advisor on scientific and technical espionage activities. The fact that Stephenson's own mentor, Sir William Wiseman, was a leading figure in the Anglo-Zionist movement also provided the future SOE head with an inside track to the resources and talents of the Zionist networks. According to Richard Deacon, a semiofficial historian of British and Israeli intelligence, Stephenson was the single most important figure in establishing the Israeli intelligence services following independence. As we have already seen in the case of Permindex chief Major Louis Mortifier Bloom- field, many of the postwar commercial fronts through which the SOE operated were joint ventures with the Mossad. In the effort to create an Israeli intelligence apparatus married to the British SOE, Julius Klein would play a major role on behalf of Sir William Stephenson. From his position at the close of World War II as head of the U.S. Army Counterintelligence Corp. responsible for Western Europe, Kleinâ€”by his own admission--illegally rerouted whole shiploads of medical supplies, trucks, construction equipment, etc. from earmarked destinations in Germany and Austria into the Haganah in Palestine. Throughout the early 1950's, Klein made frequent trips to Israel to aid in the training and structuring of the Mossad. We shall turn our attention once again to General Klein at a later point in our inquiry when he emerges as a principal, background figure in the recruiting of the board of directors for Permindex. Another Rosenbaum associate in the Swiss-Israel operation was Shaul Eisenberg, the top weapons procurer and scientific spy for Israeli intelligence during the 1950's and 1960's. According to the Washington Post , Eisenberg was officially the Mossad station chief in Vienna during much of this period. Born in Shanghai, Eisenberg was the unofficial trade representative for the Israelis in the Far East. Official statistics show that 90% of the Israeli business in that region involved sales of diamonds. Shaul Eisenberg also ran a string of scientific consulting firms in New York City that maintained contracts with the major Canadian firms engaged in the exporting of nuclear technology. These companies have been publicly identified as part of the nest of high technology firms created by the Stephenson SOE following the war. Completing the board of directors of Dr. Tibor Rosenbaum's Swiss-Israel Trade Bank were: * Abe Feinberg, the head of the Americans for Haganah, a thinly-veiled front for SOE- Zionist espionage and laundering operations during the pre-independence period; * Phillip Klutznick, self-described protege of Julius Klein and Secretary of Commerce in the Carter administration; *David Gravier, the enigmatic Argentinian Zionist banker who was indicted"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Permindex 14 in the early 1970's in New York on charges of bribery and extortion and subsequently disappeared in a mysterious plane crash over Mexico that to this day has federal court officials and investigators debating whether or not he is still alive. Indictments were handed down against Gravier after considerable evidence surfaced that he was serving as \"financial consultant\" to a number of Latin American terrorist organizations kidnapping American executives and government officials for fantastic ransoms. How did this enormous international network of black market banking ventures service the operations of Major Bloomfield's \"trading company?\" According to the findings of the SDECE, $200,000 in black market revenues were channeled into the Banque de la Credit Internationales accounts maintained by Permindex. Among the sources of those funds was the Bank Hap-oalim, the Israeli banking institution owned by the Histadrut, for which Major Bloomfield was the chief Canadian fundraiser. Those funds were passed onto the New Orleans station chief of the FBI's Division Five, Guy Bannister. From New Orleans, Bannister deployed one of his agents, Jerry Brooks Gatlin, directly to Paris with a suitcase full of cash for hand delivery to the OAS Generals. In 1966, at the very outset of the Garrison investigation into the assassination of President Kennedy, Gatlin--who operated a Permindex-Division Five front called the Anti-Communist League of the Carribean--died when he was thrown out of a sixth floor window in a San Juan, Puerto Rico hotel. By this time, FBI Division Five spook Bannister had already died under equally mysterious circumstances. Sources in New Orleans reported at the time of Bannister's death that within hours of his demise, agents of Division Five had invaded his office and his home and carted off all of his files. Those documents never materialized again. Colonel Clay Shaw There was no coincidence to the fact that the Permindex funds for the 1962 aborted assassination attempt against Charles de Gaulle were laundered through a New Orleans- stationed agent of Division Five. By 1962, New Orleans had already assumed the role of field operations center for the assassination cabal headquarted offshore on the island retreat at Tryall. The reason that New Orleans assumed a special role in the cabal is that it headquartered the major U.S. subsidieary of Permindex, the International Trade Mart, directed by Colonel Clay Shaw. Within the overall organizational chart of Permindex, Colonel Shaw maintained two principal roles, Through his International Trade Mart, Shaw retained a secondary capability for washing large volumes of money on an international scale. But first and foremost, Shaw was responsible for \"handling\" the next of agents deployed through Permindex's various fronts to carry out the assassination of John F. Kennedy. By the time that the Kennedy conspiracy was placed on a fully operational footing in the spring of 1963, Colonel Clay Shaw had already put in over"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Permindex 15 twenty years of duty under the direction of Stephenson's SOE. In order to situate the special role of the New Orleans Colonel and the International Trade Mart that he presided over in the Permindex assassination cabal, it is first necessary to return briefly to the Montego Bay outpost of SOE Chief Sir William Stephenson and to retrace the process through which the Special Operations Executive turned its wartime capabilities into a postwar fifth column devoted to destroying and capturing the American republic. As we have already noted, both during and after World War II, it was the modus operandi of the SOE to operate principally through commercial fronts. In 1945, immediately following the \"official\" curtailment of SOE operations within the territorial United States, Sir William Stephenson founded the Newfoundland Development Corporation in partnership with Jerry Smallwood, then Premier of the offshore colony(it was not until 1948 that Newfoundland was admitted as a Province to Canada). The following year, Stephenson set up BRINCO, an energy exploration company also located on Newfoundland, with financing from Rio Tinto Zinc, an already familiar component of Britain's Dope, Inc. apparatus, and staffing by leading figures from wartime British intelligence. These Newfoundland ventures were the prototypes for the vast string of \"offshore\" ventures that the Stephenson apparatus would create over the next decades. The very same year that BRINCO was launched, Stephenson relocated to Jamaica where he founded the \"retirement colony\" at Montego Bay. Simultaneous to the SOE's invasion of Jamaica's Montego Bay, the Stephenson-centered group created the British- American-Canadian Corporation. According to David Ogilvie, another SOE executive who drafted the corporate prospectus, B.A.C. was to be \"a profitable company of merchant adventurers.\" Ogilvie himself became the Vice President of the company, with John Pepper, the chief of Stephenson's wartime Washington, D.C. Bureau becoming President. Ogilvie subsequently founded the New York City blue ribbon advertising agency Ogilvie and Mather, drawing upon his wartime black propaganda experience as well as his pre-war stint with the Gallup Polls organization. B.A.C. was financed thorugh the Hambros financial group in London, through Stephenson's top U.S. protege William Donovan(wartime head of the OSS), Sir Rex Benson, and U.S. Steel magnate Edward Stettinius. British-American-Canadian Corporation was soon renamed the World Commerce Corporation. By the late 1940's, W.C.C. was doing such a large share of the U.S. and British trade activity into Latin America that one contemporary source commented that if there were \"several World Commerce Corporations, there would be no need for the Marshall Plan.\" Stephenson and company were quietly and systematically building up the infrastructure of trading companies, banks, shipping lines, etc. through which to conduct their multi-billion dollar Opium War against the United States. By 1946, Colonel Clay Shaw was already a part of that covert command structure. Shaw's association with the Stephenson circle dates back to at least the onset of World War II. At that time, Shaw served as an OSS"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Permindex 16 officer stationed in London. According to Shaw's own testimony, published in The Kennedy Conspiracy by New Orleans District Attorney Garrison's staff investigator Paris Flammonde, he served as an OSS liasson officer to the headquarters of British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. Through that experience, Shaw developed such a feeling of attachment to the British Empire that he seriously considered expatriating to England at the close of the war. It is not difficult to imagine the raving Anglophile Shaw (another practicing homosexual in the mold of his Permindex superior Major Bloomfield) choosing instead to assume the role of agent of Her Majesty's government \" behind enemy lines\" in the United States. Shaw did return to the United States, to his birthplace, New Orleans, to assume the directorship in 1945 of the International House / World Trade Center, a \"non-profit association fostering the development of international trade, tourism and cultural exchange.\" Almost immediately, Shaw left the World Trade Center to found the International Trade Mart, also in New Orleans. Very much a profit making venture, the International Trade Mart sponsored permanent industrial expositions, focussed particularly on the Carribean region then being \"colonized\" by the Stephenson World Commerce Corporation. Was Shaw's New Orleans International Trade Mart a front for SOE activities from the beginning in 1946? It is a fact that in 1958, as soon as Major Bloomfield established his own \"permanent industrial expositions\" firm, Clay Shaw became a board member and with that, his New Orleans Mart became a subsidiary of Permindex's international arm, Centro Mondiale Commerciale. What sort of evil design did Shaw and Stephenson share back in 1946 when they launched their International Commerce ventures? Today, there are over 50 \"world trade marts\" located in 30 countries around the world. Each of these world trade marts is made up of over 1,000 corporate subscribers. Since 1968, all of the world trade marts have been hooked together through a massive computerized data bank. That data bank now functions through an intelligence- transmitting satellite system, one of the largest privately-owned satellite systems in existence. The satellite-computer control point is maintained by the World Trade Center Associationâ€”the offspring of the very New Orleans World Trade Center that Clay Shaw assumed the directorship of at the close of World War II on behalf of the Stephenson SOE apparatus. The computer-satellite system maintains a tracking of all international trade routes, carriers and rate scales; a virtual inventory and tracking map of every air-land-sea shipping medium and bulk cargo in the world. Among the 50-plus world trade marts hooked into the WTCA satellite-computer complex is the Hong Kong World Trade Center--a joint venture of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank and the Jardine and Mathieson Company. HKWTC is the single largest and highest-priced chunk of real estate in"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Permindex 17 Hong Kong. Dope, Inc., through this Hong Kong center thus maintains a transnational tracking system that is more sophisticated and technologically advanced than the capabilities at the disposal of any government attempting to combat its deadly traffic. In 1958, however, Permindex had not yet emerged as an international octopus of trading fronts hooked up through satellite-based computers, possessing the resources for global money laundering at the push of a button on a computer console. Yet, as court records in New Orleans, Montreal and Paris document, millions of dollars in \"hit money\" passed through the Permindex organization to bankroll the most deadly assassination plots of the century. We have already met the black market bankers, many of them linked to the financial, political and intelligence establishment of the state of Israel, whose special role in the Permindex cabal involved the laundering of the \"hit money\" into the hands of FBI Division Five couriers for delivery to the designated assassination teams. We shall now investigate the second major component of the Permindex assassination bureau, the network of protected killers whose actions have irreversibly shaped the course of history for the last two decades. Garrison Hands Down an Indictment In Febuary of 1969 proceedings began in the New Orleans Parish Court in the case of The State of Louisiana versus Clay M. Shaw. New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison, flaunting the findings of the Warren Commission, had gone before a Grand Jury and successfully petitioned for a murder conspiracy indictment against Permindex board member Clay Shaw. It would take the mysterious deaths of seventeen key prosecution witnesses and the launching of a nationwide media witchhunt against the New Orleans DA to defeat Garrison's effort to get to the bottom of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in Dallas on November 22, ]963. What evidence had Garrison compiled against the New Orleans Colonel and his co- conspirators on the board of directors of Permindex? At minimum, Garrison had \"cracked\" the Kennedy assassination plot at the operational level; at the level directed by New Orleans case officer Shaw. On March 14, 1967, Garrison brought Perry Raymond Russo, an insurance salesman from Baton Rouge, La. before a three judge criminal district court panel. Russo testified that during the middle of September, 1963, he had been witness to a conversation between Clay Shaw, Devid Ferrie and an individual he identified as \"Leon Oswald.\" The topic of the conversation was the assassin- ation of President John Kennedy. In that conversation, Ferrie, an agent of Division Five about whom we shall learn more later, emphasized the importance of using at least three marksmen in order to create a \"triangulation of fire.\" He added, according to witness Russo, that a scapegoat would be required to secure the escape of the actual assassins."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Permindex 18 According to the Garrison investigation, the individual introduced to Russo as \"Leon Oswald\" at the September ]963 meeting was in all likelihood not the Lee Harvey Oswald charged by the Warren Commission with having â€¢ conducted the \"lone assassination\" of President Kennedy. According to an unpublished manuscript by \"William Torbitt,\" the individual (bearing a striking resemblance to the actual Lee Harvey Oswald) was William Seymour, an agent for a Miami-based private detective agency called Double-Chek. Double-Chek, according to \"Torbitt,\" was a U.S. subsidiary of the Rome Centro Mondiale Commerciale and functioned as a frequently used front for Division Five and CIA activities. Double-Chek was reported to be the CIA channel for weapons into the Bay of Pigs invasionary force. Those weapons were provided through the Schlumberger Company of Houston, Texas, the Schlum-berger Company whose president Jean DeMenil was present at the Tryall Compound on Montego Bay for the meetings at which the Kennedy \"hit\" was planned. Seymour, according to the \"Torbitt\" manuscript, was one of several indiv-uals responsible for impersonating Lee Harvey Oswald in the several-month period leading up to November 22. Seymour traveled throughout Texas into Mexico under the name \"Lee Oswald.\" He left a trail of witnesses who would testify that they had spoken with \"Oswald, that \"Oswald\" was an avowed Cuban communist sympathizer, and that \"Oswald\" had made statements that in retrospect pointed strongly towards his interntion to kill the President of the United States. Seymour and the other \"Lee Oswalds\" were deployed under the direction of FBI Division Five Southern chief Guy Bannister, the same Bannister who oversaw the laundering of $200,000 in Permindex money into the hands of the OAS Generals in France. According to evidence present in the course of the Garrison inquiry into the Kennedy assassination, Clay Shaw, Georgio Mantello, and Ferenc Nagy, all of the board of directors of Permindex and its subsidiary Centro Mondiale Commerciale, were in place in New Orleans, Dallas and Los Angeles on November 22, 1963 handling aspects of the assassination and coverup. That deployment had been set by Major Bloomfield several months earlier. Evidence gathered during the Garrison grand jury and published by Garrison investigator Paris Flammonde established that several members of the Permindex cabal were present at the airport restaurant in Winnipeg weeks before the assassination in Dallas to review the final details of the plan. Witnesses identified one of the individuals at the Winnipeg airport as Major Louis M. Bloomfield. Who were the assassins deployed to carry out the \"triangular firing\" on President Kennedy in Dallas on November 22? According to \"Torbitt\" papers, the assassins â€” seven expert riflemen in all â€” were part of a special team of the most expert killers in the world that had been put together in 1943 at the combined initiative of FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover and SOE commander Sir William Stephenson. Members of that team would be implicated in the assassinations of Reverend Martin Luther King and Senator Robert F. Kennedy."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Permindex 19 We have identified a number of the specific individuals implicated in the actual execution of John Kennedy. We have traced their personal chain of command into the FBI's Division Five and into the board of directors of Permindex. To fill out the picture, however, it is now necessary to delve further into what particular operational capabilities these individuals represented. As we probe these protected assassins, we shall return over and over again to the unavoidable fact: that Britain's Dope, Inc. killed Kennedy. The Solidarists Three of the principles in the Permindex assassination of John F. Kennedy were Eastern European and White Russian emigres. Each of these individuals, Jean DeMenil, Ferenc Nagy and Paul Raigorodsky, was a leading figure in the Solidarist Movement of fascists. As we have already noted, Ferenc Nagy was a minister in the wartime Horthy government that ruled Hungary on behalf of Adolf Hitler. After the war, Nagy was himself briefly installed as Prime Minister during 3.946-47. Nagy resigned from that post through an infamous telephone call placed from the lobby of a Swiss bank where Nagy had just opened a sealed account with the government funds he had looted on the way out of Hungary. On his departure from Hungary, Nagy immediately became involved in the Solidarist movement. What are the Solidarists? The Solidarists were Eastern European and White Russian fascists, predominantly former officials of the wartime \"Quisling\" governments of Eastern Europe and vererans of the Nazi eastern front intelligence apparatus known as the \"Gehlen Organization\" after its commander Nazi General Reinhard Gehlen. When at the close of World War II, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill launched the \"Cold War\" with his Fulton, Missouri speech, the Eastern European espionage and sabotage networks created by Gehlen became highly valuable property. Even before the war had come to a close, Gehlen was in negotiations with the British and American intelligence services that were already preparing for the cold war showdowns with the Soviet Union. By the mid-1950s, Gehlen's organization, previously U.S. and British property housed in West Germany, was formally incorporated into the government of the Federal Republic of Germany as its intelligence service, the Bundes-nachrichtendienst (BND). Gehlen continued to use his position as head of the BND on behalf of the Anglo- American intelligence networks, including Permindex. Thus, for example, Gehlen was personally deeply involved in the 1962 OAS assassination attempt against General Charles DeGaulle, the assassination attempt bankrolled through Major Bloomfield's international trading company."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Permindex 20 On June 15, 1961, according to documents obtained by the French SDECE, Gehlen met with OAS head General Raouel Salan and OAS \"hit team\" director General Maurice Cahlle at the BND's safehouse in Schwabing, West Germany. At that meeting and other discussions between the BND head and the OAS Generals, Gehlen promised his support in the assassination plot and arranged escape and safehouse plans for the OAS leaders in the event of an aborted attempt. Gehlen did, in fact, provide safehousing in Munich for OAS agents, including Jacques Soustelle, Georges Bidault and General Challe. Gehlen's efforts against DeGaulle continued well after the the OAS had been driven into the underground and Permindex formally expelled from Western Europe. In early 1968, DeGaulle's intelligence service discovered that Maurice Picard, a former head of the secret security department of the French Interior Ministry and subsequently the director of the French civil defense department was a spy for Gehlen. Picard was tried and convicted in October 1968 of espionage and sentenced to seven years in prison. The Solidarists represented the core of the Gehlen spy apparatus who managed to escape from Eastern Europe in the closing moments of World War II. Among the leading components of the Solidarists movement was a highly professional espionage, sabotage and assassination network called Narodnyi Trudovoy Soyuz (National Alliance of Solidarists). Founded in the late 1920's out of the old Menshevik circles in Russia, NTS functioned as one of British secret intelligence's premier spy rings inside the Soviet Union. NTS was bankrolled by Royal Dutch Shell chairman Sir Henry Deterding and by Vickers Arms president Sir Basil Zaharoff. At the close of World War II, NTS established offices in Munich and New York City. From 1939, the principal financial backing to the NTS and all of the other \"Solidarist\" groupings was provided through the Tolstoy Foundation, a self-described refugee relief and cultural fund. The current office of the Tolstoy Foundation in New York City is located in a West 57th Street building that has been the property of the British SOE since the middle of World War II when it housed the offices of a dozen front companies all involved in smuggling arms and other military equipment to the Haganah in Palestine. At the time of this writing, one of the Tolstoy Foundation's neighbors in the West 57th Street building in Julius Klein Associates, the public relations company owned by the same General Julius Klein we have already encountered in our investigation into the dirty money branch of the Permindex organizational tree. Among the officially listed board members of the Tolstoy Foundation since the early 1960s height of Permindex activity were Paul Raigorodsky and Jean DeMenil, both of whom were in attendance at the Tryall Compound on Montego Bay for the sessions that plotted out the assassination of John Kennedy. Raigorodsky was the owner of Claiborne Oil Company of Baton Rouge, Louisiana. He later became an official United States government liasson officer to NATO. Jean DeMenil, the millionaire owner of the Schlumberger Company of Houston, was one of the prinvipal financial \"angels\" behind the cultural activities of the Tolstoy Foundation and its allied Solidarist movement."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Permindex 21 Following the Russian Revolution, DeMenil's family fled their native country winding up in France. There, Jean DeMenil married into the powerful Schlumberger family of the Neufliz, Schlumberger, Mallet banking empire. In the 1950s, Schlumberger diversified into the oil diagnostic equipment industry. The company that they created for that purpose is now the largest company in the field worldwide, accounting for the production and sale of 50% of all of the equipment in existence. In 1958, son-in-law Jean DeMenil became President of the company, headquartered in Houston, Texas. That company, as we noted earlier, served as a weapons conduit for the CIA and FBI Division Five throughout the efforts against Fidel Castro. Those smuggling operations were conducted in conjunction with the Double- Chek Company of Miami, Florida. During the mid-1960's, de Gaulle's intelligence services established that the Neufliz, Schlumberger, Mallet Bank was channeling funds into Jacques Soustelle for the purpose of bankrolling OAS terrorist activities. The American Council of Christian Churches One of the principal agencies through which the Solidarist movement maintained contact with its operatives worldwide was the Old Orthodox Catholic Church of North America, and its affiliated Synod of Bishops of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia. This splinter church out of the Russian Orthodox Church had been established originally as a front for British intelligence espionage activities inside Russia following the Bolshevik Revolution and retained that function in North America after many of its operatives had relocated to the West following World War II. The Old Orthodox Catholic Church of North America was an affiliated Church of the American Council of Christian Churches(ACCC), an umbrella organization nominally representing those traditionalist churches of all denominations that opposed the ultra-liberal outlook of the World Council of Churches and its subsidiary National Council of Churches. It is the case that many \"conservative\" churches are to this day affiliated with the ACCC for precisely the reason stated above. However, there is another side to the ACCC that prompted District Attorney James Garrison to identify it as one of the agencies deeply involved in the Kennedy assassination conspiracy; and to issue an indictment against the ACCC's west coast director Reverend E.E. Bradley, on charges that he aided Colonel Clay Shaw in assassinating the President. In 1941, J. Edgar Hoover, in consultation with British SOE head Sir William Stephenson and Division Five recruiter Louis M. Bloomfield, arranged for his close friend Reverend Carl McIntire to found the American Council of Christian Churches. Mclntire was already a contract agent of Hoover's FBI Division Five. The purpose of the ACCC was to conceal an extensive espionage and intelligence unit to be deployed throughout the United States, Canada, Nexico and Latin America. The spies and saboteurs were to operate under the cover of Christian missionaries."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Permindex 21A As part of the ACCC espionage net, Hoover, Stephenson and Bloomfield created a secret assassination unit in 1943 under the direction of ACCC Minister Albert Osborne. The unit consisted of 25-30 of the world's most skilled riflemen. It was housed in a missionary school for orphans in Pueblo, Mexico. Up through at least 1969, the special \"kill unit\" remained intact under the personal supervision of J. Edgar Hoover, operating through his trusted agent of thirty years, Albert Osborne. According to author \"Torbitt,\" it was Osborne and a team of seven expert riflemen from the Pueblo \"kill unit\" who carried out the assassination of John F. Kennedy in Dallas on November 22, 1963. The records of the Warren Commission established that Albert Osborne had been a charter member of the ACCC. In 1942 (while working for the Hoover-Bloomfield Division Five) Osborne had directed a Nazi blackshirt group called the Compfire Council in the rural area around Knoxville, Tennessee. At that time he had nearly been arrested following an incident in which he burned an American flag in protest against the U.S. entry into the war against Nazi Germany. He shortly thereafter left Tennessee to relocate to Pueblo, Mexico. Garrison documented that on October 10, 1963, Osborne had visited New Orleans, making three stops in town. First he visited the offices of Clay Shaw at the International Trade Mart building. Later, the"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Permindex 22 same day he visited the offices of FBI Division Five courier Jerry Brooks Gatlin, an individual we encountered earlier in probing the 1962 assassination attempt against French President Charles De Gaulle. Osborne's final stop in New Orleans was at the office of FBI Division Five Southern chief Guy Bannister at 544 Camp Street. From New Orleans, Osborne traveled directly to Mexico City where, according to the records of both the Garrison investigation and the Warren Commission, he was seen repeatedly in the custody of the \"Leon Oswald\" whom we met earlier in the company of Clay Shaw and David Ferrie. This circle of assasins closes a bit further as we return to the case of yet another Division Five operative who maintained a cover as a priest in the employ of the American Council of Christian Churches: David Ferrie. In 1946, Ferrie dropped out of a Roman Catholic Seminary in Ohio and joined the Byelorussian Liberation Front, simultaneously being ordained as a priest in the Old Orthodox Catholic Church of North America, an agency we have already identified as a front for the Solidarist movement and FBI Division Five. Ferrie was subsequently redeployed to the southern region of the FBI where he operated as a Division Five recruitment officer (placing him under the direct jurisdiction of Major Bloomfield). According to testimony before both the Warren Commission and the Garrison Grand Jury given by FBI operative Jack Martin, Lee Harvey Oswald was recruited into the FBI Division Five in 1956 by none other than David Ferrie. While nominally in the Marine Corps, Oswald received special training in covert espionage activites at the Naval Intelligence School on the Memphis Naval Base. One aspect of this training included special instruction in the Russian language, provided by an agent of the Solidarist movement operating in San Francisco under the cover of the Federation of Russian Charitable Organizations, a west coast branch of the Tolstoy Foundation. From 1956 up until his untimely death in the basement of the Dallas Police headquarters in November, 1963, Lee Harvey Oswald had been on a secret Division Five payroll, maintained through the Immigration and Naturalization Service, a unit within the Department of Justice. During the six-month period leading up to his murder in Dallas, the real Lee Harvey Oswald had been operating out of New Orleans and Dallas under the immediate supervision of Division Five regional director Guy Bannister. In fact, the New Orleans headquarters of the pro-Castro Fair Play for Cuba Committee, a group that Oswald actively participated in during 1963, was located in the same Camp Street office building that housed Bannister. Unbeknownst to Oswald, his \"infiltration\" into the pro-Castro grouping on behalf of Division Five had"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Permindex 23 a far different purpose than he imagined; a purpose that would become clear only after he assumed the role of the \"patsy\" that David Ferrie had discussed with Clay Shaw and William Seymour. The Syndicate and the Cubans We have now seen two components of the network of protected killers who carried out the assassinationof John Kennedy on behalf of Permindex. In the case of both the Solidarists and the American Council of Christian Churches, we have seen the fruit of Sir William Stephenson's wartime penetration of the national security apparatus of the United States. One further note must be made here concerning Stephenson's wartime activities as they would later surface in the Permindex assassination plot against Kennedy. Stephenson oversaw the recruitment of U.S. organized crime figures into the SOE-OSS during World Mar II. The best-known case in point was the \"rehabilitation\" of convicted drug-runner, pimp and suspected murderer Charles \"Lucky\" Luciano, Luciano was dispatched to Sicily under joint SOF-OSS direction to reconstitute old networks that had been dispersed or expatriated during the Mussolini period. In this effort, Luciano would actively collaborate with Count Gutierrez di Spadafora, a board member of Permindex who we shall return to in a later section of this chapter. According to a four-part series of articles published in October, 1978 in the Soviet youth magazine Ogonyok by Julian Semyonov, the Stephenson- Bloomfiled-Luciano collaboration was still operational in 1962 when Luciano was the case officer on the scene in Sicily for the assassination of Italian Oil Minister and close DeGaulle collaborator Enrico Mattei. Mattei died when his plane went down over the Mediterranean after having been tampered with during a brief, unscheduled stopover at an obscure airport in Sicily. According to Semyonov, the decision to go with the plane sabotage was made by Luciano only after the options of hiring an OAS hit team or an American \"leftist\" controlled by a Texas oil company had been rejected because they would have been too politically explosive. The Texas oil company in question was an investor in Major Bloom-field's international trade expositions firm. Luciano was by no means the only syndicate figure coopted into the employ of Permindex. According to official incorporation papers on file in New York City and Berne, Switzerland, mob attorney Roy Marcus Cohen and Montreal crime boss Joseph Bonanno were both personal stock holders in Permindex through their ownership of the Lionel Corporation of Hillside, New Jersey. At the time of Permindex's initial incorporation, 50 percent"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Permindex 24 of the corporate stock was purchased by Major Bloomfiled. A significant minority position was purchased by Lionel Corporation. Several years before the Permindex investment, Lionel had been bought up by Cohn and Bonanno. Sources indicate that the Lionel buy into Permindex was financed through a $600,000 \"loan\" that Cohn arranged through contacts in Hong Kong. New York City corporate records show that as of 1958, Joseph Bonanno was the chairman of the board of Lionel and attorney Roy Cohn was the president. In 1960, shortly after the Lionel-Permindex arrangement had been sealed, Joe Bonanno was formally removed from the chairmanship of the New York-New Jersey-headquartered defense contractor. His replacementâ€”at the personal recommendation of Major Louis M. Bloomfiledâ€”was recently retired General John Bruce Medaris. What chain of events brought Cohn, Bonanno and Medaris together as investors in Permindex? Let us begin by establishing some background information on two of three individuals in question. To appreciate the circumstances under which General John Bruce Medaris became a collaborator of Bloomfield and Permindex, it is necessary to first return to the New Orleans colonel who was indicted by District Attorney Garrison for the assassination of John Kennedy. Just prior to his retirement from the U.S. military, Clay Shaw spent 1945 in the capacity of aide-de-camp to General Charles 0. Thrasher, deputy chief of the European Theatre of Operations in the U.S. High Command. Shaw's assignment was to recruit Nazi scientists over to postwar U.S. intelligence. Shaw apparently concentrated his recruitment efforts at the Peememuende research station on the Baltic Sea, the laboratory where Nazi rocket scientists concentrated their efforts on the development of the V-2 rocket. All told, 127 Nazi scientists were brought over to the United States through the efforts of Shaw and his associates. At least two of those individuals, Werner Von Braun and Walter Dornberger, have been identified by author \"Torbitt\" as principal figures in the Permindex cabal that plotted the assassination of John Kennedy. Von Braun was given a prominent position within the U.S. rocket program and headquartered at the Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville and Mussel Shoals, Alabama. Mussel Shoals was also the operations center for the Defense Industrial Security Command, an official secret police agency established at the initiative of J. Edgar Hoover to provide security for defense installations during World War II and beyond. It had originally been chartered as the security division of the Tennessee Valley"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Permindex 25 Authority. Given its heavy concentration on counterespionage operations against Nazi and, later, Soviet spies and saboteurs, DISC was from its inception interfaced with the FBI's Division Five. By the early 1950s, DISC was under the direction of General John Bruce Medaris, an individual described by fellow senior grade officers in the U.S. Army as an anti-Semite and Nazi sympathizer. Werner Von braun was appointed as Medaris' second in command. Sharing a common rabid anti-Soviet outlook Medaris and Von Braun rapidly emerged as the two leading proponents within the U.S. military-scientific establishment for an early strategic nuclear showdown with the Soviet Union. At December 1957 Senate hearings of the Armed Services Committee, both Medaris and Von Braun denounced President Eisenhower for \"permitting\" the Soviets to carry out their successful Sputnik satellite launch. They demanded that the entire U.S. space and rocket program â€” including its civilian-related components â€” be placed under tight national security cover â€”i.e. under the control of the DISC security command â€” and proceed into an allout crash development to narrow the so-called \"missile gap.\" For approximately one year, President Eisenhower capitulated to the demands of Medaris and Von Braun representing the DISC establishment at Mussel Shoals. For reasons never fully documented, President Eisenhower dramatically reversed himself in October 1959. Summoning all concerned with the Army-controlled space program to an emergency session at the White House, the President stripped Medaris and Von Braun of their control over the space program and handed control over to a civilian agency, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Circumstantial evidence suggests that Eisenhower had caught wind of a virtual palace coup in the works. Shortly before his move against Medaris and Von Braun, Eisenhower ordered his Attorney General, Herbert Brownell, to prepare legal papers ordering the breaking up of two of the most powerful cartels operating under U.S. incorporation: the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) and the United Fruit Company. Both of these companies were from their founding, propietaries of the British SOE networks and Dope Inc. Although Eisenhower's efforts against RCA and United Fruit were ultimately blocked, his continuing concern over the spreading influence of the cabal that we have identified as Dope, Inc. was present even in his farewell speech on his retirement from office. In that speech, Eisenhower cautioned the American people that the growth of the \"military- industrial complex\" represented by far the greates threat to the continued existence of the American republic."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Permindex 26 How effective were Eisenhower's efforts in blocking the power grab by General Medaris, Werner Von Braun and the military-industrial apparatus? Despite his formal forced retirement from the U.S. Army, official records show that General Medaris remained an adviser to the U.S. Army and the Department of Defense through at least 1963. Von Braun retained his position with the rocket program and with the secret police arm of the \"military-industrial complex,\" DISC. While General Medaris and his ex-Nazi cohort Von Braun were preparing their holy war against President Eisenhower and those more sane elements in the country who favored a commercial development of nuclear technology in tacit collaboration with Western Europe and the Soviet Union (Eisenhower's \"Atoms for Peace program), parallel Red Scare efforts were being run out of the Washington, D.C. Senate chambers of Joseph McCarthy. McCarthy's legal counsel and on-the-scenes controller in the Witch Hunt was Roy Marcus Cohn, soon to be a prominent figure in the Permindex assasination bureau. Roy Cohn was born in 1927, the only son of Albert and Dora Marcus Cohn. His father was a Bronx Democratic Party boss and eventually was appointed to a New York State Supreme Court judgeship. The Marcus family gained a significant amount of wealth in the garment industry (the family fortune later evolved into the Van Heusen Shirt Company). Through his father's political connections, Roy Cohn was appointed to a post in the U.S. Attorney's Office in New York City in 1947, at the age of 20 when he graduated from Columbia University Law School. Cohn's first cases under then Assistant U.S. Attorney Irving Saypol involved the prosecution of a dozen secondary leaders of the Communist Party U.S.A. for violation of the Smith Act and related antisubversion \"Red Scare\" measures. Cohn then wrangled a position on the prosecution staff in the spy trial of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg â€” a case that established his credentials as the \"infant terrible\" of the witch hunters. By this point, Roy Cohn had already acquired the backing of a group of prominent individuals who would steer his career through the next decade. Some of these individuals have already been presented to us in our tour of Major Bloomfiled's SOE assassinatin bureau. In 1948, a group of rightwing American Jews, led by Major General Julius Klein, founded the American Jewish League Against Communism, Strong circumstantial evidence suggests that the League was, from the outset, a front for the continued activities of the British SOE and its \"partners\" in FBI Division Five."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Permindex 27 The fact that J, Edgar Hoover's longtime crony, famous bootlegger Louis Rosenteil, was one of two principal financial backers of the League lends credence, as does the presence of SOE \"Palestine Bureau\" man Julius Klein. In fact, Hoover's relationship to Rosenteil was so close that in 1957, through the mediation of Roy Cohn, Hoover's right hand man Louis Nichols was hired by Rosenteil's Schenley's Liquor as senior vice-president commanding a hefty salary of $100,000 per year. We have already seen in the case of Reverend Carl McIntyre that Hoover made a regular habit of bringing his closest friends into the clandestine operations of Division Five, often through their creating of front organizations through which Division Five could conceal its activities. Joining Klein and Rosenteil on the board of the American Jewish League Against Communism (AJLAC) were a collection of rightwing journalists, businessmen and rabbis all of whom shared a common close friendship with FBI chief Hoover. They included George Sokolsky, a Hearst columnist known for his later enthusiastic support for the McCarthy witch hunt; Alfred Kohlberg, the other financial angel of the League; Rabbi Benjamin Schultz, Eugene Lyons, Louis Waldman, Lawrence Fertig and Isaac Don Levine. In 1949, the League was handed over a confidential 100-page FBI Division Five document on communist influence in the government. The report was turned over to a Pentagon intelligence officer by Hoover's public relations man Louis Nichols with sepcific instructions to turn the document over to Julius Klein and the AJLAC. According to Roy Cohn, who had already been picked up as a bright young star in the League's orbit, series of private conferences were held in New York City and Washington, D.C. at which a list of four Senators was drawn up. Those Senators would each be approached with the secret FBI report and offered the backing of the AJLAC and Hoover in \"getting the story across to America,\" Of the four Senators, all of whom were Republicans, Joseph McCarthy of Wisconsin bit the hardest. Quoting from Roy Cohn: \"Joe McCarthy bought communism in much the same way as other people purchase a new automobile. The salesman showed him the model; he looked at it with interest, examined it more closely, kicked the tires, sat at the wheel, squiggled in the seat, asked some questions, and bought. It was just as cold as that.\" written into the contract signed between McCarthy and the League was the appointment of Roy Cohn as the general counsel of the McCarthy committee. Cohn would be the recipient of the leaked FBI file material that would be used by the Wisconsin Senator in running his witch hunt."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Permindex 28 It should be noted that strong support for McCarthy's launching of the communist witch hunt was provided by Father Edmund Walsh, the Jesuit director of the Georgetown University School of Foreign Service. On January 7, 1950, just one month before McCarthy's infamous Wheeling, West Virginia speech, the Senator met with Father Walsh at the Colony Restaurant in Washington, D.C. and received strong urging to adopt the Red Menace theme. Walsh had recently returned from Bavaria where he had maintained longtime associations with the Wittels-bach House and with Nazi \"geopolitical theoretician\" Major General Professor Karl Haushoffer. Julius Klein, during this same period was establishing his lifelong friendship with Otto Von Hapsburg. To this day, Klein hosts the Hapsburg heir during his annual trip to Chicago. When the Army-McCarthy hearings blew up in the collective faces of Cohn and the Senator from Wisconsin, Cohn returned to New York City to enter private law practice in the firm of Saxe, Bacon and O'Shea, While McCarthy's career and life both ended in a bout with alcoholism and mental collapse, Cohn consolidated the connections he had forged during the years in Washington, D.C. â€” particularly with Hoover and Rosenteil â€” and moved on to even more outrageous activities than he had engaged in while in the Senate. Conn's first major commercial venture â€” which brought him in league with one of the leading organized crime figures in North America â€” was his 1958 takeover and reorganization of the Lionel Corporation. AT the time of Â©the Cohn-Bonanno takeover, Lionel had spent several years in the red. Cohn, a distant relative of Lionel Corporation's founder Joshua Lionel Cowen, bought out the company, which was then manufacturing toys, and began buying up small companies involved in the production of electronics components all related to the defense industry and specifically the pace program. Cohn's next move was to bring General Medaris onto the directorate of Lionel. The Cohn-Medaris-Bonano combination â€” with special support from FBI cheif Hoover -- spent the next half dozen years pairing up the subsidiary companies with lucrative defense contracts. At the same time the nest of corporate fronts was used to carry out other \"business\" on behalf of Major Bloomfield's trade expositions company which, as we noted, Lionel had been an enthusiastic investor in. At the end of 1963, Cohn et al. sold off Lionel and all of its subsidiaries. One of the most lucrative pieces of the Lionel \"empire,\" the Intercontinental Corporation of Garland, Texas, was sold to Robert Vesco. It became one of Vesco's ear-"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Permindex 29 liest financial scores. It was the same Intercontinental Corporation that author \"Torbitt\" identified as the front through which a group of Cuban exiles, all veterans of the Caribbean gambling and narcotics syndicate and the Bay of Pigs paramilitary operation, were assigned to Permindex board member Ferenc Nagy to play supporting roles in the assassination of John Kennedy. Cohn's partnership with Joe Bonanno, as well as his access to hundreds of thousands of dollars in HOng Kong black market money, brings us to an even more essential point about Roy Cohn's post-McCarthy career. Far from being an \"attorney\" in any conventional sense of the word, Cohn functioned as the \"Mr. Fix- it\" for a cabal of diversified criminal elements ranging from Lionel President Joe Bonanno to FBI boss Hoover to some of the most chic Princes of the continental jet set. The common denominator of all of Cohn's ventures has been dope and dirty money. The starting point for unraveling the \"Cohn Connection\" to Dope, Inc. is the Pacific resort spot in the sun, Acapulco. The Montego Bay Tryall Compound is not the only jet set retreat where the eleite of the British SOE, the international black nobility and their chosen operatives gather to plan out their political activities â€” including murder. On more than one occasion in the past several decades, similar sessions have been convened in the Mexican resort city. Among the attendees at such recent sessions have been the Baron and Baroness Porta-nova, Howard Stein of the Bank Louis Dreyfuss, Serge Semeneko, the White Russian president of the Hilton International Hotel Corporation and the Tolstoy Foundation, John Samuel Schlesinger of the South African Eagle Star Corporation, and a collection of New York City real estate barons and garment center bigwigs. The \"host\" for the gatherings in question has been Roy Cohn. We have already seen how Sir William Stephenson and a coterie of SOE spooks moved in on MOntego Bay at the very close of World War II and built that spot up into a cross between paradise and Fort Knox. In the case of Acapulco, the guiding figure behind its postwar emergence as a watering hole for the super- rich and the super-secretive was former Mexican President Miguel Aleman, himself a central figure in the international narcotics and assassination cartel. It was during Aleman's tenure as Interior Minister (1940-46) and President of Mexico (1946-52) that J. Edgar Hoover's Divi-"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"30 Permindex sion Five was given a carte blanche to set up shop in that country. Combined SOE-Division Five operations were set up all over Mexico and very few were shut down at the end of the war. The case of Reverend Osborne's Christian boy's school has already been identified as one such case in which a \"hundred year lease\" was signed between Aleman and SOE-Division Five. When President Aleman formally retired from politics in the 1950s, he built up a vast real estate empire in Mexico that today includes a string of resort hotels; among them one of the largest resort spots in Acapulco. Not coincidentally, all of Aleman's hotel acquisitions are managed by the Canadian Pacific Corporation â€” the biggest covert importer of Golden Triangle narcotics into North America and a heavy investor in the Caribbean islands that house some of the most important black market money houses in the Dope, Inc. international portfolio. Among Aleman's other major holdings is a lion's share of the stock in the fifth largest company in Mexico, Tavos de Acero de Mejico (TAMSA). The director of TAMSA, Bruno Pagliai, is the cousin of Princess Beatriz of Savoy, herself a resi- dent of Mexico and a frequent guest at Aleman's own Acapulco jet set parties. It is through two Aleman confidants that the Mexican end of Dope, Inc. begins to emerge more clearly. Aleman's personal banker and one of his most intimate friends is Max Schein, president of the Banco Mercantil de Mejico. Schein's bank is the correspondent bank to Bank Leumi, the Israeli banking giant that we have already encountered as a major laundering vehicle for the revenues of international dope traffic. Schein is additionally the unofficial head of the Zionist lobby in Mexico as the chairman of the Sociedad Technion de Mejico, the local branch of the Israel Techneon Society â€” the Mossad's overseas scientific espionage front. Among the board members of the Techneon International is Major Louis Mortimer Bloomfield of Permindex. Aleman's other and far more exposed flank into Dope, Inc. is Gonzalo N. Santos, a former aide and well-publicized personal friend of the ex-President. Santos was a business partner of a Guadalajara-based Cuban exile named Alberto Sicilia Falcon. Falcon, once an asset of the Division Five apparatus in Miami and later Mexico City, was arrested in 1975 as the head of a major heroin importing ring that stretched from Thailand to Turkey to Marseille, The Falcon ring had an entire fleet of private planes that ran drug pickup and dropoff routes throughout Latin America into the United States. That ring also ran a string of heroin laboratories."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Pennindex 31 While Falcon's associate and Aleman staff officer SAntos survived the 1975 bust unscathed, he was the subject of a 1977 Mexican Senate inquiry into the guns-for-dope traffic across the United States-Mexican border. Santos was labeled as the major conduit of illegal weapons gotten in the United States and smuggled into the hands of some of the leading oligarchical families in Mexico. Many of these weapons were believed to have passed into the hands of the Liga 23 de Septiembre, Mexico's equivalent to the Italian Red Brigades. Where does the New York City attorney and former mouthpiece for Joe McCarthy fit into this picture? As we have already noted, Cohn has frequently been the host for secret get-togethers in sunny Acapulco drawing in a variety of personalities from the various regional boards of Dope Inc. -- including Mexico's ex-President Aleman. Sources have reported to the authors of this book that Cohn is the go-between for the delivery of high grade drugs to the jetsetters who frequent Acapulco but spend much of their time in such more mundane locales as New York City. Among Cohn's most intimate Acapulco associates are the Baron and Baroness di Portonova. The Portonovas are among the closest associates of the Princess Beatriz of Savoy and Miguel Aleman. Among other things, the Portonovas have been described as the couriers of a hundred million dollar plus annual cocaine and marihuana supply into the New York City jetset; a supply that they personally courier aboard their yacht. This dope supply is disbursed as the private stock for the New York chic through such nightpots as Studio 54. Up until Studio 54 owners Steve Rubell and Ian Schraeger were busted by the Internal Revenue Service on charges of tax evasion in 1979, they had been paying \"attorney\" Roy Cohn a $7,000 per week retainer. When Cohn had a falling out with Rubell and Schraeger --over money -- the chic disco suddenly began having severe legal problems. Hence the IRS move-in. Hence, also, the indictment of Schraeger on charges that he was part of a multi-million dollar cocaine ring. Roy Cohn's friend Baron Enrico di Portonova is the heir to a minor Genoese noble family. His personal contacts, however, cut directly into the heart of Italy's oldest Black Guelph houses, the House of Savoy and the House of Pallivicini. Both Houses are fully represented on the board of Permindex. The Baroness di Portonova is the former Sandra Cullen of Houston, Texas. The Cullen family owns one of the largest private banks and family held oil companies in Texas. Hugh Roy Cullen, the family scion, is one of the \"big four\" Texas rightwing moneymen who bankrolled Senator Joe McCarthy in 1948. We shall shortly return to the Black Guelph hand within the international dope and assassination cartel. Now it is worth noting another aspect of the \"Cohn Connection\" -- one that we shall devote a later chapter in this book to. A review of the clientel serviced by Roy Cohn's law firm reveals two striking patterns. First, Cohn is the personal attorney to New York's most \"in crowd.\" We have already seen this in the case of the Portanovas, who Cohn represents legally, and Studio 54, with which Cohn maintained a most unusual client-attorney relationship. Among his other prize clients are Bianca Jagger, Aristotle Onassis (since deceased) and Christina Onassis, the Ford Model Agency, and Conde Nast Magazines."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Perraindex 32 Cohn's second block of clients is made up of some of New York City's most powerful real estate barons. As we shall see in a later chapter, this particular cast of real estate speculators and landlords -- led by Donald Trump and Joseph Slifka and by such impressive names as Cadillac-Fairview and Olympia and York â€” represent a branch of the Dope Inc. table of organization. Their function is to take that portion of the international dope revenues designated for investment into \"legitimate business\" and wash it through the big city real estate market. As we shall see, best estimates indicate that the phenomenal profits of this \"washing\" propel New York real estate investment values above - - in total -- the entire U.S. investment in industrial capacity! Through this process, the $200 billion in annual revenues from the wholesale-to-retail cycle of international drug traffic leaps into the trillion-dollar range. In his capacity as \"Mr.Fix-It\" for the New York City-based branch office of Dope Inc. Roy Cohn has been involved in more murders than the Permindex-run assassination of President John Kennedy; in extortion and blackmail operations and in virtually every other form of political and financial corruption imaginable -- all without conviction. In June, 1973, for example, Cohn was involved in the sinking of a luxury yacht, the Defiance, off the coast of Florida. One crew member died in the sinking which serverl sources have identified as an act of sabotage designed to yield a $200,000 insurance claim for Cohn and his clients, the Pied Piper Yacht Charters Corporation. Evidence was presented to the Department of Justice substantiating the claim that the dead crewman had been shot before the boat was sunk. The Justice Department and the FBI refused to salvage the boat, leaving the insurance company and the family of the dead sailor holding the bag and Roy Cohn holding at least $20,000 of the insurance loot. The Coverup On October 13, 1967, just days after his confirmation as Attorney General of the United States, Ramsey Clark delivered a speech at the University of Virginia Law School. In that speech he stated, \"Much as I hate to do it, I just might have to prosecute Jim Garrison ... (who) took a perfectly fine man, Clay Shaw, and ruined him just for personal aggrandizement.\" Twenty four hours later, the public relations office at the Justice Department was forced to issue a full retraction of the Clark statements, which amounted to little more than a grandstand public relations intervention to discredit the Garrison inv- estigation into the assassination of John F. Kennedy. If Clark's remarks were a monstrous blunder, they did betray the fact that a massive scramble was underway during the spring, summer and autumn months of 1967 to kill the Garrison investigation before it succeded in breaking the Permindex story open in a way that could not be put to rest. As we unravel the web of government agencies, media channels and private spooks armies that were set loose both immediately after the Kennedy assassination and once again when New Orleans DA Garrison launched his own independent probe into the Clay Shaw cabal, we shall discover that the coverup of the Kennedy plot is perhaps the single most damning piece of evidence that a high level conspiracy was behind the death of the President. Once again, we shall discover the guiding hand behind the operation to be that of the British -- and Dope Inc."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Permindex 33 Attorney General Clark's flagrant interference followed more than six months' active disruption efforts on the part of a very special secret agent of the national security establishment. The agent was Walter Sheridan, the man that Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy had earlier entrusted to head up the highly irregular \"Get Hoffa\" unit of the Department of Justice. Despite such appearances of closeness to the Kennedy family machine, strong evidence suggests that Walter Sheridan had already been a longtime asset of the British SOE circuity inside the U.S. intelligence establishment at the time of his \"recruitment\" into the Kennedy camp in the late 1950s. Walter Sheridan, after graduating from the Jesuit-run Fordham University and briefly attending Albany Law School, was recruited into the Federal Bureau of Investigation, where he worked for four years. From the FBI Sheridan moved over to the newly established National Security Agency. The NSA was established in the early 1950s as the most secretive, high technology-oriented snooping agency in the U.S. government. To this day, for example, the NSA is the one intelligence service that operates under a total Official Secrets Act screen. Neither the Congress nor any other federal agency has oversight or even access to information concerning the NSA. Walter Sheridan evidently already had heavy backing. He was appointed Chief of the Counterintelligence Section, Special Operations Division, Office of Security of the NSA. He was subsequently appointed Assistant Chief of the NSA Clearance Division. The NSA had been the outgrowth of the sophisticated telecommunications and coding operations developed by the Allies during World War II. In this effort, the U.S. had been thoroughly trained by the British Special Operations Executive. Early in the war, Sir William Stephenson had established a special \"code breaking\" unit at Blechley, England, which served as a training center as well as an encoding unit employing a select group of Americans and Englishmen. Among the Americans trained at the Blechley center were Robert Sarnoff and William Buddy. Sarnoff was the son of General David Sarnoff, the founder and President of the Radio Corporation of America (Robert Sarnoff would replace his father as President on the latter's retirement during the early 1950s) and a wartime member of the SOE elite in the United States. Bundy would later become the editor of the Council on Foreign Relations' quarterly journal Foreign Affairs while his brother assumed the National Security directorship under John F. Kennedy. After the war, Sarnoff's RCA became the technological core of the capability that later was brought under top secret government control as the NSA. In that sense, the NSA is perhaps the branch of the U.S. intelligence establishment most directly run by the Stephenson SOE apparatus. Sheridan's high-level placement in the NSA Counterintelligence Division --the unit most closely interfaced with the FBI Division Five â€” belies the idea that Sheridan was first and foremost a Kennedy family loyalist. In 1958, a \"church friend\" introduced Sheridan to Robert Kennedy, who immediately hired the NSA veteran as the special investigator for the Senate Racketeering Committee, the \"McClellan Committee,\" that RFK was then serving as general counsel. When John Kennedy was elected President, Sheridan was appointed \"Confidential Assistant\" to Attorney General Robert Kennedy -- a position that placed him in the inner circle of both the Justice Department and the White House (where he maintained a secret office adjacent to the Oval Office)"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Permindex 34 As \"Confidential Assistant\" to RFK, Sheridan created the \"Get Hoffa\" unit of the Justice Department. According to sources who served close to Robert Kennedy at that time, the \"Get Hoffa\" unit rapidly became a private fiefdom of Sheridan that even the Attorney General could not penetrate after a point. Kennedy Justice Department historian Victor Navasky described the Sheriâ€” dan unit in the following way: Its modus operandi was pure cloak and dagger . . . Sheridan's relations with the FBI were highly irregular in that it received little or no cooperation from the top, yet Sheridan, an ex-FBI man, had a degree of line cooperation in the field that was, in some respects, unparalleled. He actually coordinated FBI agents with his own men â€” told them where to go and when, and they went.\" Sheridan had similar access to the resources of the internal Revenue Service, the Secret Service, the U.S. Marshalls and the Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Division of Treasury. In effect, Sheridan replicated the operational capablities and the targeting methods of the wartime SOE-Division Five network. Sheridan's private army replicated the methods of the SOE in another significant area. In addition to the official channels that Sheridan was able to navigate through every federal agency even remotely involved in intelligence and enforcement, he apparently created a nest of clandestine agencies â€” under corporate cover â€” that were deployed to carry out those special operations that were so flagrantly illegal that they could not even be remotely associated with the government. According to author Jim Hougan, Sheridan created a private investigative agency known as \"five eyes:\" International Investigators Incorporated of Indianapolis, Indiana. Although the firm was officially incorporated on October 3, 1966 (two years after Sheridan left the Justice Department), Five Eyes maintained offices in Indianapolis, Chicago, Detroit, Louis- ville, Nashville, Memphis and Minneapolis by no later than fall 1961. For its first five years of existence, no corporate records existed anywhere in the United States even suggesting its existence. Sheridan's Five Eyes (also frequently referred to as Three Eyes, for International Investigators, Inc.) went out of business in the late 1960s at the same time that another Three Eyes was being founded by some of Sheridan's top operatives in the \"Get Hofffa\" unit. That Three Eyes, the International Intelligence, Incorporated, is more commonly known as Inter-tel, the private security arm of the Caribbean gambling and dope center known as Resorts International. We shall return to this offshore paradise in our next chapter. In February 1967, Walter Sheridan was hired by the National Broadcasting Corporation (NBC) as an \"investigative journalist\" attached to the NBC White Paper television documentary series. Sheridan's assignment for NBC? To do a special television report on the investigation into the assassination of President Kennedy that had just been launched by New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison. By July of that year, Sheridan would be indicted by Garrison on four separate charges of public bribery â€”all revolving around Sheridan efforts to wreck the Garrison probe."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Permindex 35 According to evidence submitted by Garrison, Sheridan had engaged in flagrant witness tampering aimed at both publicly discrediting the Garrison probe and preventing key witnesses from appearing before the New Orleans Grand Jury. One of the witnesses targeted by Sheridan was the Baton Rouge insurance salesman Perry Raymond Russo who we met earlier as the \"fourth man\" in the assassination planning session convened by Clay Shaw. On June 19, 1967, Assistant New Orleans District Attorney Andrew J. Sciambra delivered a memo to Garrison proving that Sheridan had used his NBC team to harass Russo on a round-the-clock basis, had gotten to Russo's employers at Equitable Life Insurance to pressure them to relocate Russo outside of the Louisiana jurisdiction of Garrison, and had succeeded in smuggling Russo out of the state for a \"vacation\" in California. Once out of Garrison's hands, Russo was to be put on nationwide television to denounce Garrison for having \"doctored\" his testimony to create a phony conspiracy case against Clay Shaw. The Sciambra memo further reported that the NBC White Paper crew was working closely with a research team from the Saturday Evening Post on the \"Get Garrison\" operation. The Saturday Evening Post had just been purchased by Bert SerVaas of Indianapolis. SerVaas* name appeared in October 1966 on the incorporation papers of International Investigators, Incorporated as its president. A second bombshell exploded in the face of the Sheridan operation on August 19, 1967 in a Chicago courtroom. There, an official of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Zachary Strate, testified that he had been offered a deal by Sheridan. In return for his joining Sheridan in the propaganda blitz against Garrison, Strate would be provided with classified government documents proving that his conviction on extortion in a case involving Teamster president and Sheridan target Jimmy Hoffa, had been obtained through the use of illegal wiretaps. Extortion, blackmail, kidnapping, bribery â€” these were not the only weapons unleashed in the war against Garrison. By the time of the 1967 Garrison probe, over a dozen key witnesses had died under mysterious circumstances. Guy Bannister, the FBI Division Five chief in New Orleans, was dead. Lee Harvey Oswald was dead, shot at point blank range before a nationwide television audience in the basement of the Dallas Police Headquarters. His assassin, Jack Ruby, far from being the \"distraught good Samaritan,\" had been a business partner of Guy Bannister and David Ferrie in a series of Cuban casino ventures before the fall of Batista; and had been involved in the Schlumberger-Double-Chek gunrunning adventures first into Fidel Castro's forces, and later into the anti-Castro army put together by the CIA after the Cuban president's turn to the Soviet Union. David Ferrie was also dead, the victim of a \"suicide\" overdose of narcotics on the very eve of his appearance before District Attorney Gar-"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Permindex 36 rison's probe. According to Jules Rocco Kimble, a witness before the Garrison probe, he and Jack Helms had entered the Ferrie apartment just hours after the former Division Five contract employee had died and removed a file cabinet full of documents. Kimble and Helms, both admitted members of the Ku Klux Klan, then fled to Canada. Their flight, and their future lodgings and safety, had been guaranteed by Walter Sheridan of NBC. Sheridan's blast at Garrison did eventually air on NBC national television and did serve as the trigger mechanism for a barrage of attacks on the New Orleans DA from the national media. It should be noted here that NBC was from its founding a wholly owned subsidiary of the Radio Corporation of America. At the time of the airing of the NBC White Paper on Garrison, the president of NBC was Robert Sarnoff, the wartime veteran of Sir William Stephenson's SOE retreat at Blechley, England. In retrospect, President Dwight Eisenhower's efforts to bust up the RCA monopoly and his subsequent farewell warnings about the danger of the military-industrial complex were among the clearest, most important â€” and unheeded â€” legacies of his presidency. What apparatus within the government stood behind Walter Sheridan and his \"Get Garrison\" apparatus? We have already identified the NSA and FBI Division Five pedigree of this Jesuit-trained spook. Evidence further exists that another secret police agency â€” one that we have already encountered in our probe of Permindex â€” was instrumental in the effort to cover up the cabal behind the Kennedy assassination. According to author \"Torbitt,\" a New Orleans employee of the Double-Chek agency named Gordon Novel had infiltrated the Garrison investigation staff in Spring 1967 and determined that Double-Chek and the FBI's Division Five were being actively investigated for their parts in the Kennedy assassination. Novel was put in contact with Walter Sheridan. When Garrison discovered the double agent role being played by Novel, he subpoenaed the former \"staff investigator\" to appear before his Grand Jury probe. Novel left Louisiana under the protection of Sheridan and was delivered to a Virginia safehouse where the results of a doctored lie-detector test were released to the press by Sheridan claiming that Novel had provided conclusive proof that the Garrison probe was a pure publicity stunt with no substantive evidence. From Virginia, Novel was reportedly safehoused in Columbus, Ohio for a period of time. His protectors in Columbus were deployed out of the headquarters of the Defense Industrial Security Command. In addition to its operations center at the Redstone Arsenal at Mussel Shoals, Alabama, the DISC maintained headquarters in an office building on East Broad Street in Columbus. At he time of this safehousing, DISC was under he direction of General Joseph Carroll, formerly the Deputy Director of the FBI under J. Edgar Hoover. Carroll was the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency. According to author \"Torbitt,\" it was actually the DISC secret police apparatus that coordinated the activities of Walter Sheridan, even during the"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Permindex 37 secret sleuth's official tenure at the Whtie House and the Department of Justice. DISC was directly linked to the coverup against Garrison as well. According to the records of the New Orleans Grand Jury, nearly a dozen individuals who had worked with Lee Harvey Oswald during his residence in New Orleans and who represented potential crucial sources of evidence in the probe, had been hired by defense contractors immediately following the Kennedy killing, given lucrative positions, and placed under the constant screen of DISC, which maintained security responsibilities for all of the facilities and personnel of the nation's defense contractors. DISC, the NSA , FBI Division Five, the Radio Corporation of America, NBC Television. All agencies benefitting from the highest classifications of national security clearance carried out a string of murders, kidnappings, character assassinations and black propaganda efforts on behalf of Permindex and its Dope, Inc. employers. Seventeen years have passed since the assassination of John F. Kennedy in Dallas; and at this very moment, Permindex and the British command that ordered the cold-coup by assassination remains one of the best kept secrets in the world."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"APPENDIX The following is a listing of companies, associations, embassies and individuals listed in the Permindex directory.
