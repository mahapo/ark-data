It is the contrary that is correct. Islamic terrorist organizations are hotbeds of impostors in service of the West. It is well known that there are various dubious relationships that exist between Islamic radicals and Western powers. The truth is far more sinister. Islamic terrorists are connected with Western power through an intricate network of secret societies. While outwardly claiming to adhere to disparate religions, the Islamic terrorists follow a heretical version of the faith, ultimately rooted, like their counterparts in the West, in the same occult doctrine, the worship of Lucifer, and the belief in the use of religion as a disguise to deceive the masses. Collectively, this web is headed by a nefarious cabal commonly identified as the “Illuminati”. The Illuminati was the name of a secret society, founded by Adam Weishaupt, in Germany, in 1776, with the goal of seeking world domination through subversive means. It’s existence is one of the few instances in history in which historians are willing to recognize the existence of the diabolical conspiracy, because the evidence is undeniable. However, in 1784, the order was exposed, and forced to disband. Scholars, therefore, have used the fact of the suppression of the order as justification to suppose that no conspiracy continues to exist into our time. Nevertheless, Weishaupt himself boasted, “I have considered every thing, and so prepared it, that if the Order should this day go to ruin, I shall in a year re-establish it more brilliant that ever.” 1 The “Illuminati”, really, is merely a convenient term to refer to those individuals and secret organizations who continue to pursue the same goals in our time. In actuality, the order’s existence began long before the eighteenth century. The truth is it began in Babylon, in the sixth century BC, with the advent of the Jewish heresy of the Kabbalah. According to their own accounts though, the Illuminati represent the descendants of the Fallen Angels who inhabited the lost continent of Atlantis. These Fallen Angels interbred with humans, producing a supposedly superior race called “Aryans”, to whom they taught the Ancient Wisdom. Therefore, the Illuminati regard themselves as inheritors of a centuries- long tradition of preserving their occult knowledge, against the “tyranny” and “despotism” of “organized religion”. Ultimately, they perceive it their duty : The Clash of Civilizations"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 2 to institute a world order, to impose their cult as a one-word-religion, and governed by one of their own. Thus, throughout the centuries, the Illuminati have been carefully intermarrying with one another, to preserve their “sacred” bloodline, to transmit their esoteric knowledge from generation to generation, and from which their messiah is to issue. For this reason, they also refer to themselves as “the Family”. Today, fronted by the powerful banking dynasties of Europe, the Illuminati exercise supremacy over the world’s governments, as well as their economies, and even their cultures. Ultimately, the Illuminati are an international network, existing in a parallel world, straddled between fronts of legitimacy, and activities on the black market and in the underground. Their method of conquest is to wholly demoralize the societies of the world, wrecking their very fabric, by promoting every vice, including sexual depravity, greed and war. By enslaving the nations of the world through colossal debt, they ensure subservience, and guarantee the slow transfer of their sovereignty to global government. By encouraging stock market speculation they siphon off the wealth of the ignorant masses. In the end, by creating a global economic cataclysm of untold magnitude, they intend to demonstrate to humanity their own ineptitude, and offer their reign as salvation, by implementing a global fascist state, to be governed by their expected messiah. Deprived of any moral restraint, they fund their covert activities by dominating the world of illegal arms dealing, narcotics trafficking, and prostitution. Their activities are intertwined with those of the world’s leading intelligence services, including the CIA, Mossad, and Britain’s M16, as well as international crime syndicates, like the Mafia and the Asian Triads, and the Yakuza of Japan. 2 Adopting any disguise to suit their collective objectives, they work hand in hand with the Freemasons and numerous other secret societies, and are responsible for the emergence of numerous radical cults, from the Hare Krishna’s to the Moonies, of Christian and Muslim Fundamentalism, and most importantly, terrorism. By wielding inordinate financial and political power, the plan of the Illuminati is to foment a global war, or World War III, from which will emerge, out of the ashes of the expired civilizations of our time, like a phoenix from the fire, a New World Order. The coming confrontation is being presented as a “Clash of Civilizations”, between the “Liberal Democratic West” and “Islamic fundamentalism”. Despite all the fear mongering, however, the Muslims do not pose a threat. The Muslim world has been sufficiently weakened due to their own internal corruption, in addition to the subversive activities the Western powers that, by WWI, the Allied powers were able to brush aside the forces of the Ottoman Empire, which by that time had crumbled to near dust. Since, the Muslim world has been in disarray, incapable of uniting to even represent Islam, let alone defend its cause."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Introduction 3 This fact was acknowledged by Zbigniew Brzezinski himself, the primary architect of the fabricated threat. As to whether or not such a phenomenon is a menace to the world today, he responded: Nonsense! It is said that the West had a global policy in regard to Islam. That is stupid. There isn’t a global Islam. Look at Islam in a rational manner and without demagoguery or emotion. It is the leading religion of the world with 1.5 billion followers. But what is there in common among Saudi Arabian fundamentalism, moderate Morocco, Pakistan militarism, Egyptian pro-Western or Central Asian secularism? Nothing more than what unites the Christian countries. 3 Therefore, so as to rile the masses of the Western world against Islam, it has been necessary to artificially foment militancy in the Muslim world, by creating terrorist groups, to create the illusion of Islam’s competition with the “democratic” West. What is meant by democracy, however, is secularism. Originally, in the eighteenth century, the goal of the Illuminati had been to separate religion from the state, to replace it with a rule of their own. Through the widespread propaganda of the eighteenth century, they discredited Christianity as conflicting with the findings of science, and defined the Christian Church as an organization rife with corruption and greed. While it is certainly true that the Church was fraught with abuse, the citizens of the West were told to throw the proverbial baby out with the bathwater, for it was not its moral teachings, or the common worshipper, that were inherently corrupt, but the upper echelons of its politically minded hierarchy. Paradoxically, the secularism of the Illuminati is based not on atheism, but on ancient occult teachings. To the upper levels of the Illuminati, it was Lucifer who “liberated” man, showing him the truth that there is no truth. Rather, all morality is mere convention, invented by the dull masses. To them, there is only Will, and therefore, man triumphs by overcoming all apprehension, otherwise regarded as morality, that prevents him from achieving what he desires. Or, the “ends justify the means”. The program of the Illuminati, beginning in the eighteenth century, has been to disparage all religion as superstition, and the enemy of “Liberty”, that is, the freedom to do whatever they will. To inculcate the veneration of such a principle in the minds of the gullible masses of the West, history has been rewritten to present modern secular states as the culmination of centuries of progress towards “Liberty”, which is upheld as the fundamental characteristic defining the Western superiority over the East, where “despotism” supposedly perpetually reigns. Throughout “Western” history, we are taught, from Greece, to the Roman Empire, the Renaissance, and finally the Enlightenment, European thinkers have been progressively distancing themselves from “superstition”, or religion. The culmination of this supposed progress were the French and American Revolutions, and their implementation of secular rule, seen as the triumph of “Liberty”."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 4 In reality, these revolutions were coup d’etats effected through the machinations of the Illuminati. And, the first priority of the Illuminati, following the revolutions, as propounded by its prominent members, like the Marquis de Condorcet in France, Johann Fichte in Germany, and Thomas Jefferson in America, was the establishment of compulsory education. The first to articulate the need to interpret history as the progress of “Liberty” was Georg Hegel, German professor and member of the Illuminati. 4 Based on Kabbalah, Hegel proposed that history was the unfolding of an idea, as God coming to know himself. To Hegel, it is man who becomes God, as Western civilization overcomes superstition, by progressively advancing towards the implementation of “Liberty.” However, it was not until World War I that Hegel’s mythology of Western civilization was fully established. America, to justify its entry into the War, presented itself and the Allied Powers as, not disparate nation-states, but members of a single “Western” civilization, and capitalized on the notion of “Liberty” and “Freedom”, to cloak its imperial strategies in high ideals. Known as General Education, or the Western Civ. Course, the Hegelian interpretation of history was then imposed on the American university system. The mission was accomplished through the influence of two Illuminati front organizations, boards of trustees acting as benefactors of the educational system, the General Board of Education (GEB) chartered by the John D. Rockefeller, and the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching (CFAT). As revealed by William H. McIlhany, in The Tax-Exempt Foundations , from minutes of their meetings, these foundations asked themselves the following: “is there any means known to man more effective than war, assuming you wish to alter the life of an entire people?” They could not find one, and so helped to precipitate WWI. Following the Great War, however, recognizing the need to maintain the control of the “diplomatic machinery” of the United States they had achieved, the foundations determined that “they must control education”. Together, as William McIlhany described, the Rockefeller and Carnegie foundations “decided the key to it is the teaching of American history and they must change that. So they then approached the most prominent of what we might call American historians at that time with the idea of getting them to alter the manner in which they presented the subject.” 5 Through their influence, the entire American educational system was coordinated to serve a centralized command. Control of this system would be two-pronged, dividing study into pure and social sciences. The pure or applied sciences were to serve the emerging Military-Industrial-Complex, while the social sciences, like psychology, sociology, and anthropology, were designed to study the behaviour of human beings, towards achieving means of controlling or modifying that behaviour. Lastly, the remaining fields, like history of political science, were to inculcate a proper “interpretation” of history."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Introduction 5 Because, according to the boards’ directives, “history, properly studied or taught, is constantly reminding the individual of the larger life of the community... This common life and the ideals which guide it have been built up through the sacrifice of individuals in the past, and it is only by such sacrifices in the present that this generation can do its part in the continuing life of the local community, the State, and the Nation.” In Universities and the Capitalist State , Clyde Barrow commented that: The full-scale rewriting of history under state supervision not only facilitated a short-term justification of American participation in the war, but also helped to institutionalize a much broader and more permanent ideological conception of the United States in the social sciences and humanities. 6 The first recommendations to educators, during WWI, were careful to warn them that using outright lies or false information was a “mistaken view of patriotic duty”, that was likely to be counterproductive in the long run. These recommendations went on to provide detailed suggestions on what to teach, and how to teach history “properly”. They urged teachers to stress the difference between Germany on the one hand, and France, Britain, and the United Sates on the other, as a conflict originating in the struggle between despotism and democracy. This was a continuation of the same revolutionary struggle for Liberty, which America had initiated in the American Revolution. If it had been America’s destiny to perfect democracy, it was now America’s responsibility to defend democracy wherever it was threatened and bring it to the rest of the world. This myth of America’s role in the preservation of “democracy” and its struggle against “depostism”, is again being resorted to, towards the build up to World War III, or the so-called War on Terror. Ultimately, according to Francis Fukuyama, in deliberate reference to Hegel, we are at the “End of History”. That is, we have achieved the pinnacle of human intellectual progress. We cannot advance further, and Western style “liberal democracy” is the final product. However, one bastion of medievalism is preventing our final step forward: “militant” Islam. Therefore, according to Samuel Huntington, as first published in Foreign Affairs of the Council on Foreign Relations, a front group of the secretive and elusive Illuminati, the West is headed for an inevitable confrontation with Islam, or a Clash of Civilizations ."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 6"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"7 The Luciferian Bloodline The plot for a series of World Wars in the twentieth century, culminating in a third against the Muslim world, was devised in the nineteenth century, by American Civil War general, Albert Pike, then Grand Master of Scottish Rite Freemasonry, a primary adjunct of the Illuminati. However, though the final stages of this plot have been largely reserved for our time, the conspiracy is affiliated with a lore of occult knowledge that dates back to at least the sixth century BC. This lore begins with a heresy, known as Kabbalah, which disguises itself as Jewish, but is a pact to seek world domination, and the eradication of religion in favour of the worship of Lucifer. The goal devised by these Kabbalists has since been the installation of their “messiah” as world leader, who, according to their interpretation of the Bible, is to be of line of King David. Since that time, to preserve this purported lineage, until the advent of their expected leader, these Luciferians have been carefully intermarrying amongst each other, and have included among them many of the leading figures of history. They begin with a Persian Royal family, who intermarried with that of Alexander the Great. By combining with that of Herod the Great, these families were responsible for the creation and dissemination of the leading mystery school of the Roman Empire, the Mysteries of Mithras, which eventually succeeded in co-opting the emerging Christian movement, by producing Catholic Christianity. Nevertheless, a secret, or Gnostic, version of Christianity, also derived from Mithraism, survived to compete with Catholicism, in the form of several secret societies, like the Templars, Rosicrucians and Freemasons, practicing occult arts, or what is known as “witchcraft”. This tradition was perpetuated by the most popularized branch of the Luciferian bloodline, the Merovingians. Symbolized by the Holy Grail, the Merovingians, after intermarrying into the family of a Jewish Exilarch, or claimant to the Jewish throne, culminated in all the leading families of the Crusades. It was at this time that this European branch of the family recombined with others from Eastern Europe and Armenia. These Eastern aristocracies 1 : The Lost Tribes"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 8 derived from the enigmatic Khazars, who had populated southern Russia and the Basin of the Don River, and who, in the eighth century AD, had converted to Judaism. Legend has it, however, that the Khazars were remnants of the Lost Tribes. Armenia, just across the Caucasus, was another locale of these supposed Lost Tribes. It was the intermarriage and perpetuation of these aristocratic bloodlines that were being referred to in the heraldic symbols of the lily, the rose, the double-headed eagle, and the skull and crossbones. Also during the Crusades, this network connected with an important occult center hiding within the Islamic world, in Cairo Egypt, who followed the heretical version of Islam known as Ismailism. According to Masonic legend, a number of these “Eastern Brethren” were rescued and brought to Scotland, where they provided the basis of Sottish Rite Freemasonry, which emerged in the eighteenth century. However, at the same time, this legend also provided the basis for the establishment of Freemasonry in Egypt, which then became the second center of Illuminati activism. It was from these secret networks of Islamic impostors by which the Western powers created Islamic terrorism, used to foment of a Clash of Civilizations, through the fabrication of the terrorist threat. The Fallen Angels The Kabbalah was devised in the sixth century BC, as an aberration of Judaism, which combined Babylonian magic and astrology. It was from this point onward that the Bible was compiled, and evidently underwent some corruption in order to incorporate these new teachings. To understand the history of the Illuminati, it is therefore first necessary to look at the Bible. There, by assessing the claims of their descent, we can determine the nature of the Illuminati beliefs, before we can then follow the evolution of their conspiracy over time, from the days of Herod the Great, to the Khazars, the Crusades, and finally to our time, and the advent of al Qaeda. The Illuminati claim descent from the Fallen Angels, from whom they supposedly learned the “Ancient Wisdom”, also known as the Kabbalah. These “Fallen Angels” are referred to in the Bible, Book of Genesis , as the Nephilim , or “Sons of God”, and were said to have descended to earth and intermarried with human beings. Christian interpretations struggle with the passage, choosing to translate the term into “mighty men”. However, apocryphal Jewish texts explain that they were the Lucifer and his legions, who were cast out of Heaven, and took wives from the female descendants of Cain. They produced a race, according to the Bible, known as the Anakim . According to the Illuminati, it is these other-worldly beings who first introduced humanity to the occult arts, including astrology, magic and alchemy. This account of history is believed by occultists to accord with that of the lost"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"The Lost Tribes 9 continent of Atlantis, and that the race produced by the intermixing of these Fallen Angels and humans is thought to be the Aryans. Supposedly, their corruption caused great corruption on the earth, to such an extent that, according to these same Apocryphal works, God decided to destroy them through the Flood. Here, it is important to understand the Bible account, from which their legends are interpreted. According to the Bible, wickedness soon returned to the earth, however, when Noah’s son Ham committed a sin. Ham moved southwest into Africa and parts of the near Middle East, and was the forefather of the nations there. From Ham’s son, Mizraim, came the Egyptians, from Phut, the Lybians, and from Kush, came the Kushites, who established Ethiopia. Cush was also the father of Nimrod, the legendary founder of the ancient city of Babylon, who was responsible for instigating the building of the Tower of Babel. Supposedly, Shem, Ham’s brother, and Cush’s great uncle, became appalled by his nephew’s evil deeds, and killed Nimrod. Before his death, however, Nimrod had married and impregnated his own mother, named Semiramis. After Nimrod was slain, Semiramis instituted the worship of herself and her son among the people of Babylon, who came to regard Nimrod as a sun-god, and she was a goddess, or Queen of Heaven. Nimrod, or Bel, as he was later worshipped by the Babylonians, was also identified with the constellation of Orion, the shepherd of the stars, mythologized as a hunter by the Greeks, and therefore referred to mystically in the Bible as “a mighty hunter before the Lord”. Semiramis, later revered as Ishtar, was identified with the planet Venus, as were all the goddesses modeled after her. Nimrod was confronted in his blasphemy by Abraham, the founder of the Jewish nation, who left his own nation of star-worshippers, in Harran, to found a new religion. That religion, centered around the worship of a single transcendent God, and the practice of justice and compassion towards one’s fellow man, became known as Judaism. Abraham’s grandson Jacob, later Israel, had twelve sons, from whom were descended the Twelve Tribes of Israel. However, later, in the Bible, through the influence of the Kabbalah, these tribes acquired mystical symbolism, which would eventually become the prominent features of European heraldry. Like the astrological zodiac, these twelve tribes were divided into four camps of three, in accordance with the four seasons of the Zodiac, divided according to the Four Elements. Thus, Reuben, who is compared to running water, with Simeon and Gad, are Aquarius. Judah, the lion, with Issachar and Zebulon, are Leo. Benjamin, Manasseh and Ephraim, whom Jacob compares to the ox, are Taurus. Naphtali, Asher and Dan, whose device is the scorpion, synonymous astrologically with the eagle, are Scorpio. The brothers tried to kill their sibling Joseph, by dropping him into a well, but he was later rescued, and eventually became a governor in Egypt. When the Israelites were stricken with famine, they were forced to seek the assistance of Joseph in Egypt, who finally revealed himself to his treacherous brothers. After four hundred years in Egypt, the increasing number of Israelites"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 10 in the country began to concern Pharaoh, who oppressed them. Moses was sent by God to revive the monotheistic religion of Abraham among the Israelites, and lead them to the land promised to their forefather, in what is known as the Covenant. For according to the Bible, God had chosen the Jewish people above other nations, to follow His commandments. After confronting Pharaoh, Moses successfully acquired permission to lead his people out of the land. However, a short time after the Israelites had cross the Red Sea, and while Moses was away on Mount Sinai receiving the tablets of the Ten Commandments, they blasphemed by constructing a statue of a Golden Calf from their melted Jewelry. Scholars acknowledge that this cow-god was borrowed from the Apis Bull of the Egyptians, who was equated with Osiris. More accurately, Osiris and Isis were merely the Egyptian versions of the same couple worshipped in Babylon originally as Nimrod and Semiramis. Moses ordered the Seventy Elders to slay the idolaters, and the tribe continued its journey to the Promised Land, where they were ordered to conquer the inhabitants. According to Kabbalistic legend, it was to these Seventy that Moses had originally revealed the secret doctrine. These Seventy would become the origin for the foundation of the Sanhedrin, a legislative council that would later govern the Israelites, until their defeat at the hands of the Romans. And Moses, like his brother Aaron, was from the tribe of Levi, and the generations of priests that claimed descent from him, known as Kohanim, or Cohens, were therefore Levites as well. Palestine was then inhabited by the descendants of Ham’s fourth son, Canaan. According to the Bible, although it was Ham who had sinned, it was upon his son Canaan and his descendants that a curse would fall. According to occult interpretation, however, the Canaanites represented survivors of the Anakim. In Deuteronomy 9:1-2, we read: “Hear, O Israel! You are crossing over the Jordan today to go in to dispossess nations greater and mightier than you, great cities fortified to heaven, a people great and tall, the sons of the Anakim whom you know and of whom you have heard it said, “Who can stand before the sons of Anak?” The Israelites eventually succeed in taking hold of the land of Palestine, but soon falter into the worship of pagan gods. According to the Bible, the Jews are told repeatedly not to intermarry with the Canaanites, nor to worship their idols. Despite these warnings, not only do the early Israelites intermarry extensively with their subjects, but adopt their pagan ways, by worshipping Baal and Astarte, the Canaanite versions of Nimrod and Semiramis. Though known by different names to different peoples, this dying-god and goddess shared common characteristics. They were consistently identified with the Sun, who in winter journeyed “beneath” the earth, into the Underworld. They were therefore believed to “die”, and to resurrect in spring, corresponding to the Christian Easter. Because Baal and his sister Astarte, were regarded as twins, as well married to each other, they were identified as a single androgynous god, symbolized by Venus, whose original Latin name was Lucifer."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"The Lost Tribes 11 Basically, the ancient pagans’ belief was dualistic. They believed there to be two powers in Heaven, a good God and evil one. Because he was believed to journey there in winter, the dying-god was regarded as the god of the Underworld, reigning over the souls of the dead, and therefore identified with evil. This led to the practice of black magic. To protect oneself from him, or to summon his powers to command spirits against one’s enemies, it was believed necessary to perform heinous sacrifices. Most common was the sacrifice of children, rites which were performed in drunkenness, attended with loud music, to drown out the screams of the suffering child, and followed by sexual orgies. 1 These were the basis of the rites later known as “Mysteries”. The Medes According to Kabbalistic interpretation, the entire line of Jewish kings were descended from Joseph and Tamar, his daughter-in-law, a Canaanite woman who had disguised herself as a prostitute in order to seduce him. Their son Perez was David’s ancestor. Solomon, to whom much of Kabbalistic tradition is attributed, was the son of David from Bathsheba, a Hittite woman. Therefore, according to Kabbalistic interpretation, though the Messiah is to be a descendant of the royal line of David, being the “Son of David”, he is also descended from the Satanic lineage of the Fallen Angels, through the Canaanites. Therefore, through intermarriage with the Canaanites, the later Kabbalists could claim descent from the Anakim, and the Fallen Angels, or Lucifer and his legions. These Anakim, supposedly, were the original inhabitants of Atlantis, or Aryans. The Aryans are considered by the Illuminati to be the original core bloodline, a hybrid of humans and “divine” beings, responsible for the preservation of occult knowledge. According to modern historians, influenced by Kabbalistic legend, these Aryans, also known as Indo-Europeans, survived the Flood, or sinking of Atlantis, and found refuge in the mountains of Asia. From there they emerged the conquer the known peoples, spreading their customs and language to Central Asia, Iran, or Persia, and into Europe. Interestingly, these various peoples have also historically been identified with the so-called Lost Tribes of Israel. An important branch of these is the Medes of Iran, among whom the original Lost Tribes had been scattered, before moving on into Armenia and Southern Russia. After the death of King Solomon, in 928 BC, his realm was divided into the Kingdom of Israel in the north and the Kingdom of Judea. The Kingdom of Israel covered most of the central and northern land of Israel and was inhabited by descendants of ten of the original twelve tribes that conquered the land of Canaan under the leadership of Joshua: Asher, Dan, Ephraim, Gad, Issachar, Manasseh, Naphtali, Reuben, Simeon, and Zebulon. The Kingdom"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 12 of Judea was centered on Jerusalem, and the Judean highlands, and comprised the remaining two tribes of Judah and Benjamin. A 125 years before the same fate would afflict the nation of Judah, the Kingdom of Israel was conquered by the Assyrians in 721 BCE, and in line with the general policy of the Assyrians, its inhabitants were deported to other regions of their empire. According to the Assyrian king Tiglath-Pileser, 13,750 of the wisest and most skilled of the Israelites were deported by 733 BC, while 27,290 more Israelite sages, musicians and artisans were brought to Babylonia by Sargon II in 727 BC. According to II Kings 17:16-20, this disaster came upon the nation of Israel because: They defied all the commands of the Lord their God and made two calves from metal. They set up an Asherah pole and worshipped Baal and all the forces of heaven. They even sacrificed their own sons and daughters in the fire. They consulted fortune-tellers and used sorcery and sold themselves to evil, arousing the Lord’s anger. And because the Lord was angry, he swept them from his presence. Only the tribe of Judah remained in the land. But even the people of Judah refused to obey the commands of the Lord their God. They walked down the same evil paths that Israel had established. So the Lord rejected all the descendants of Israel. He punished them by handing them over to their attackers until they were destroyed. According to the Books of Kings , the exiled tribes were transported to the region of the Medes, known as Medea, where they assimilated themselves into the population. Medea corresponds with today’s northern Iraq, or Northwest Iran, called Kurdistan. According to Herodotus, a Greek historian of the fifth century BC, “These Medes were called anciently by all people Arian [Aryan]; but when Medea, the Colchian, came to them from Athens, they changed their name. Such is the account which they themselves give.” 2 This Medea Herodotus is referring to was the witch from the story of Jason and the Argonauts of Greek myth. She came originally from the area of then known as Colchis, just north of Armenia. According to the Greek legend, Medea later married Aegeas of Athens, after whom the Aegean Sea is named. Their son was Medus of Colchis, from whom the Medes were descended. According to Herodotus’ description, the Colchians, who dwelt in a land located along the western slope of the Caucasus Mountains near the Black Sea, were black, and probably Jewish. Like the Jews of Palestine, which he referred to as “Phoenicians”, Herodotus also regarded the people of Colchis, as deriving from an “Egyptian colony”. He not only pointed to the Colchians’ “black skin and woolly hair” as evidence, but also to their oral traditions, language, methods of weaving, and practice of circumcision. In addition, Saint Jerome, writing during the fourth century AD, called Colchis the"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"The Lost Tribes 13 “Second Ethiopia.” Similarly, two hundred years later, Sophronius, patriarch of Jerusalem, described an “Ethiopian” presence in the same region. Diodorus of Sicily, a historian of the first century B.C, in his Universal History , stated: They say also that those who set forth with Danaus [Dan, or Tribe of Dan], likewise from Egypt, settled what is practically the oldest city of Greece, Argos, and that the nations of the Colchi in Pontus and that of the Jews, which lies between Arabia and Syria, were founded as colonies by certain emigrants from their country [i.e., Egypt]; and this is the reason why it is a long-established institution among these peoples to circumcise their male children . . . the custom having been brought over from Egypt. Even the Athenians, they say, are colonists from Sais in [the Nile Delta of] Egypt. 3 By the sixth century BC, the Medes were able to establish an empire that stretched from Azerbaijan to north and Central Asia and Afghanistan. The Medes also mixed with other Iranians, especially Persians. Thus many modern Iranians are descendants of Medes. However, Mede heritage today is claimed particularly by groups in the western part of the Iranian Plateau, such as the Kurds, Lurs, Isfahan and the Turkic languages-speaking Azeri. The Scythians Although, the ten tribes, excepting Judah and Benjamin, have popularly been considered “lost” ever since, in ancient Jewish sources, their existence was well-known. According to Josephus, “...the Ten Tribes who are beyond the Euphrates till now, and are an immense multitude, whose numbers cannot be estimated.” 4 Similarly, the Apocrypha presume to also know their location. In the Fourth Book of Ezra , the Ten Tribes were said to have been carried by Hosea, a prophet in Israel in the eighth century BC, to the Euphrates, at the narrow passages of the river, from which they went on for a journey of a year and a half to a place called “Arzareth”. 5 This would have taken them to the land of the Scythians, in southern Russia, whom Josephus and others had identified as the ancestors of Gog and Magog. According to Herodotus, the Scythians emerged from beyond the Euphrates, from across the Araxes, an Armenian river that borders Armenia, Iran and Azerbaijan. 6 The Scythians first appear in Assyrian annals as Ishkuzai , related to the modern term “Ashkenazi”, from Ashkenaz, who was the brother of Magog’s brother Gomer. 7 The most significant Scythian tribes mentioned in the Greek sources resided in the basin of the Don river, just north of the Crimea, from where they invaded Armenia and Cappadocia, to become allies of the early Mede rulers. 8 In the time of Herodotus, the Cappadocians occupied the whole region from the Black Sea to the Taurus mountains, in eastern Turkey, from which the"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 14 Euphrates River descends into Syria. Certain etymologies propose that the word Scythians, from “Sacae”, in turn is derived from “Isaac Sons” or “Sons of Isaac.” Isaac, Abraham’s son, had two sons, Jacob, the father of the nation of Israel, and Esau, the forefather of the Edomites. In the Bible, Esau was the son of Isaac and Rebekah, who tricked his brother out of his birthright, the leadership of Israel. Esau was a red haired, or “red all over like a hairy garment”, and called Edom, which means red. 9 Likewise, the Scythians, according to Herodotus, “have all deep blue eyes, and bright red hair,” and practiced mystery rites dedicated to Bacchus, a Greek version of Baal. The legend persisted, such that, during the Middle Ages, German Jews regarded southern Russia and Central Asia as the location of the Lost Tribes, known to them as Red Jews, and identified with Gog and Magog. 10 In the History of the Nation of Archers, by Armenian historian of the thirteenth century AD, Grigor Akner, corroborated the legend that the Scythians were Edomites: The Esavites, who are the Scythians, descended from Esau, son of Isaac. They are black, wild, and strange looking. From them descend the Boramichk’ and Lekzik’, who dwell in holes and traps and perpetrate many crimes. And it is said that the Edomites who are the Franks also are descended from him. These three peoples, descendants of Hagar, Ketura, and Esau, mingled together and gave birth to another people, strange looking and wicked, called Tatar [Mongols], which means sharp and light. 11 Along with the Edomites, the nation of the Scythians is also closely related to that of the Tribe of Simeon. Apparently, there were only nine tribes in the northern kingdom of Israel, after the Levites joined Judah. Simeon too was still settled in the portion of the tribe of Judah although part of Simeon had immigrated to various other locations outside the Holy Land. 2Chron . 4:43-44 describes some men of Simeon who immigrated from Judah to Edom: “And some of them, even of the sons of Simeon, five hundred men, went to mount Seir, having for their captains Pelatiah, and Neariah, and Rephaiah, and Uzziel, the sons of Ishi. And they smote the rest of the Amalekites that were escaped, and dwelt there unto this day.” Thus the kingdom of Judah, after the fall of Samaria and before the Babylonian captivity, consisted of four tribes: Judah, Benjamin, Simeon, and Levi. 12"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"15 Zionism In the sixth century BC, the Assyrians finally succeeded in the sacking Jerusalem, and taking the remaining Jewish population into captivity, this time to the city of Babylon, near what is now Baghdad in Iraq. The tragedy was of enormous psychological consequence for the Jewish people. The presence of the Jewish people in the Holy Land was regarded by many as a core tenet of their faith. According to the Bible, God had ratified a covenant between Himself and Abraham, to grant the land of Palestine to his descendants. This promise, however, was contingent on the Jewish people adhering to the Commandments of the Law. Ultimately, their Exile was a punishment fulfilled for their repeated transgressions and occult leanings. Nevertheless, there were some among the Jewish exiles, who chose not to regard their captivity as a punishment, but as a temporary trial. Instead, they interpreted their status as God’s “Chosen” as a permanent relationship, and that the Promise to inhabit the land of Zion, or Palestine, was binding forever. Thus, this new Zionist interpretation was closely intertwined with the mystical directions of the Kabbalah. Therefore, this new Zionist interpretation was a bastardization of the real intent of the Jewish faith, and, as we shall see, was not an integral part of it, but was, through the centuries, increasingly imposed upon the rest of the Jewish community, by a minority committed to this diabolical scheme. In Babylon, these heretical Jews, who refused to purge their religion of pagan influences, instead added to them the adopted practices of Babylonian magic. However, knowing that magic was forbidden in Judaism, they rejected the God of Israel, choosing instead to honor Lucifer, who they identified with the traditional enemy of the Hebrew faith, Baal. In order not to reveal their apostasy, they disguised their hidden faith as an “interpretation” of the religion, a cult now known as the Kabbalah. This development is carefully described in the Koran , which explains that, though it was claimed the Kabbalah was derived originally from King 2 : The Kabbalah"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 16 Solomon, it was demons who taught such things, teaching them that which had been revealed to the angels Harut and Marut in Babylon. According to the Koran , chapter 2: 101-102: When a messenger was sent to them (the Jews) by God confirming the revelations they had already received some of them turned their backs (to God’s message) as if they had no knowledge of it. They followed what the demons attributed to the reign of Solomon. But Solomon did not blaspheme, it was the demons who blasphemed, teaching men magic and such things as were revealed at Babylon to the angels Harut and Marut. But neither of these taught anyone (such things) without saying; “we are a trial, so do not blaspheme.” They learned from them the means to sow discord between man and wife. But they could not harm anyone except by God’ s permission. And they learned what harmed them, not what benefited them. And they knew that the purchasers of (magic) would have no share in the happiness of the hereafter. And vile was the price for which they sold their souls, if they but knew. Borrowing from Jewish themes, therefore, these Kabbalists would seek world domination by arguing that they were preparing the world for the coming of the Messiah, and merely aiding God in bringing about His promise to institute them as rulers of the world. Having rejected the Jewish faith, however, they did not await the real Messiah, but would seek to establish their own ruler, who they would falsely claim as messiah, who would aid them in implementing the global acceptance of their occult creed. The Chaldean Magi The ancient world of the sixth century BC was not yet familiar with the Jewish people and their religion. Therefore, when these Kabbalists emerged from Babylon to disseminate their ideas, particularly among the Greeks, they were confusedly identified with the traditional Babylonian priests, known as the Chaldean Magi. The broad dissemination of these ideas had followed the release of the Jews from captivity by the Persians, led by Cyrus the Great, who had conquered Babylon in 539 BC. The Persians were Zoroastrians, the religion of the prophet Zoroaster, and the Magi were their priests. The Magi, according to Herodotus, were a tribe of the Medes, within the Persian Empire. The rise of the Persian Empire began in 553 BC, when Cyrus the Great, king of the Persians, rebelled against his grandfather, the Mede King Astyages. Thus the Medes were subjected to their close kin, the Persians. According to tradition, in 588 BC, Zoroaster converted the king Hystaspes. The wife of Hystaspes, Rhodah, Princess of Persia, had first been married to Zorobabel, third Jewish Exilarch of Babylon. 1 Their son, Darius,"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"The Kabbalah 17 through a conspiracy on the part of the Magi, eventually succeeded Cyrus’ son Cambyses as Persian Emperor. Cyrus the Great, and later his son and successor, Cambyses, initially curtailed the power of the Magi. As pointed out by Franz Cumont, perhaps the leading scholar of the last century, although Zoroastrianism was originally monotheistic, the Magi quickly corrupted their religion, infusing with Babylonian elements. This point has caused much confusion among scholars, who have failed to properly assess Cumont’s studies. Because, they fail to see that when numerous ancient historians refer to the “Magi”, they do not refer to orthodox worshippers of Zoroaster, but these corrupting Magi. Most interestingly, the ideas attributed to these “Magi” mirror those doctrines which later came to be acknowledged as the Kabbalah. It was they, in the sixth century BC, who developed the pseudo-science of astrology. Scholars have demonstrated that, though Babylonian religion was much concerned with astral themes, the cult of astrology could not have been invented until the sixth century BC, because of the lack of an accurate calendar system. In the Book of Daniel , Chapter 2:48, the prophet Daniel himself is made chief of the “wise men” of Babylon, that is of the Magi or Chaldeans , and yet remains faithful to the laws of his own religion. 2 Thus, this new cult of astrology and magic was incorporated into the rites of the dying-god. Mithras, the ancient god of the Persians, was assimilated to Baal, and occult mysteries and black arts were dedicated to him, which became the core of all later Ancient Mysteries. 3 In 522 BC, while Cambyses was in Egypt, a Magi named Gaumata seized power, claiming to be Smerdis, Cambyses’ brother, knowing that Cambyses had secretly killed the real Smerdis. Though Cambyses tried to advance on the usurper, he somehow died, some say by suicide. According to Herodotus, Otanes, likely the same as “Osthanes”, Cambyses’ uncle, became suspicious of the false Smerdis. From his daughter, who was married to the imposter, he learned that Smerdis was in reality a Magi. A counter-coup by Osthanes and six other nobles was then planned, until Darius, the son of Hystaspes, arrived and sided with them. Darius and Otanes debated whether to strike at once, which Darius favored, or to wait, which seemed better to Otanes. Darius’ strategy won out, the seven killed the false Smerdis, and Darius became Emperor. Ancient Greece As the Persian Empire expanded, Magian doctrines were exported to the rest of the known world, particularly to Greece. This is important towards understanding the central role that ancient Greece plays in the cult and history of the Illuminati. From the seventh century BC onward, Greece had been subject to a steady infusion of “Phoenician” immigrants, who gave Greece much of its culture,"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 18 beginning with its alphabet, which is still the basis of the one we use today. Contrary to our modern perception of it, Ancient Greece was fundamentally a Middle Eastern civilization. The case for the foreign origin of Greek culture is such that, a little over fifty years ago, a German scholar had said: ...in view of this state of affairs it could not be called out of the way to ask what there was in Archaic Greece that did not come from the orient. 4 Numerous genealogies claim that Ilus, the grandfather of Priam, was descended from Zerah, the son of Judah from Tamar, and the brother of Peres, and that he married Electra, the daughter of Atlas the Titan. 5 According to Flavius Josephus, first century Jewish historian, Zerah’ son Dara, or Darda, was also Dardanus, after whom the straight of the Dardanelles is named. From his sons, several nations have claimed descent, including the Goths, descended from his daughter Troanna. Priam’s daughter Cassandra married Aeneas, who are the reputed ancestors of the Romans, Brutus and the kings of Scotland. And from Helenus King of Troy are descended the Sicambrians, later known as Franks. According to Homer, in the Iliad , in his account of the Trojan War, the contingent of Greeks hidden within the Trojan Horse were Danaans. The Danaans were a people regarded by the Greeks as being of Phoenician origin. The Greeks, however, had no knowledge of the Israelites until the fourth century BC, and therefore, these Danaans were confused with the Canaanites of Palestine, and referred to as Phoenicians. The conquests of Greece by the Dorians, also known as Heraklids, as well, has been equated with the Denyen Sea Peoples, or Danites of the Tribe of Dan, who devastated Mediterranean civilization in the twelfth century, coinciding with the penetration of the Israelites into the Promised Land. 6 Heccataeus of Abdera, a Greek historian of the fourth century BC, confirms the hypothesis when, referring to the Egyptians, he explained: The natives of the land surmised that unless they removed the foreigners [Israelites] their troubles would never be resolved. At once, therefore, the aliens were driven from the country and the most outstanding and active among them branded together and, as some say, were cast ashore in Greece and certain other regions; their teachers were notable men, among them being Danaus and Cadmus. But the greater number were driven into what is now called Judea, which is not far from Egypt and at that time was utterly uninhabited. The colony was headed by a man called Moses. 7 Already as early as the sixth century BC, the influence of the Magi resulted in the emergence of the Mysteries of Dionysus among the Greeks. The legendary founder of the rites of Dionysus was known to have been Orpheus. Artapanus, a Jewish philosopher of the third century BC, declared of Moses that, “as a grown man he was called Musaeus by the Greeks. This Musaeus was the"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"The Kabbalah 19 teacher of Orpheus.” Certainly, Moses was not the author of heretical doctrines developed in the sixth century BC, nearly a thousand years after his death. Still, these writers at least acknowledged the Jewish origin of the Greek mystical ideas. The Magi would have adapted the Babylonian Bel to their own Mithras, who was then known as Dionysus among the Greeks, and their rites were as described by Clement of Alexandria: The raving Dionysus is worshipped by Bacchants with orgies, in which they celebrate their sacred frenzy by a feast of raw flesh. Wreathed with snakes, they perform the distribution of portions of their victims, shouting the name Eva (Eua), that Eva through whom error entered into the world; and a consecrated snake is the emblem of the Bacchic orgies. 8 Heraclitus, a Greek philosopher of the sixth century BC, equated the rites of Dionysus/Bacchus with those of the Magi, and commented: “if it were for Dionysus that they hold processions and sing hymns to the shameful parts [phalli], it would be a most shameless act; but Hades and Dionysus are the same, in whose honor they go mad and celebrate the Bacchic rites,” 9 and of the “Nightwalkers, Magi, Bacchoi, Lenai, and the initiated,” all these people he threatens with what happens after death: “for the secret rites practiced among humans are celebrated in an unholy manner.” 10 R C Zaehner has pointed out that, though the worship evil spirits was strictly forbidden in the orthodox version of the faith, the accounts of Greek authors accord in many respects with the doctrines of those referred to in Zoroastrian literature, as “sorcerers” or “deava worshippers”, or devil- worshippers. As these texts criticized, the Magi worshipped Ahriman , the Zoroastrian equivalent of the devil. 11 Plato Essentially, while the Kabbalah can be traced back to Babylon, it was not there that its initial doctrines were expounded in literary form, but in ancient Greece. Though the Jews were allowed to return to Palestine by Cyrus the Great, no evidence of Jewish literature makes its appearance until the third century AD. Rather, the earliest elaboration of Kabbalistic doctrines takes place in Greece, among the so-called philosophers, and particularly Pythagoras, and later Plato, who has long been regarded as the godfather of this tradition. The cult Orpheus, known as Orphism, became the basis of the philosophical cult developed by Pythagoras. 12 Accounts of Pythagoras having journeyed to Babylon for his learning are extensive. Through his influence, these ideas were then transmitted to Plato. Therefore, according to Momigliano, in Alien Wisdom , “it was Plato who made Persian wisdom"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 20 thoroughly fashionable, though the exact place of Plato in the story is ambiguous and paradoxical.” 13 Actually, Plato’s position is not so ambiguous. Although scholars and Momigliano are merely troubled that it evident that Plato, who is otherwise considered the example of Greek “rationality”, was evidently immersed in occult thought. Though Plato is regarded as the greatest philosopher of Western civilization, he is not deserving of that reputation, and only achieved popular notoriety over the last two hundred and fifty years, through the influence of the Illuminati press. Throughout the centuries, occultists have regarded Plato as the great founder of their agenda, and even Jewish Kabbalists regarded him as an exponent of their ideas. Essentially, while the Kabbalah was incepted in Babylon, it was Plato who first elaborated upon the Zionist principle of world domination, by formulating its vision for a totalitarian state, to be governed by the “Chosen People”, in this case, Kabbalists. In antiquity, the reputation of Plato’s purported connection with the Magi was widespread. According to Aristobulus, a third century BC Jewish philosopher, Plato had access to translations of Jewish texts, and therefore, “it is evident that Plato imitated our legislation and that he had investigated thoroughly each of the elements in it... For he was very learned, as was Pythagoras, who transferred many of our doctrines and integrated them into his own beliefs. 14 Eudoxus of Cnidus, who seems to have acted as head of the Academy during Plato’s absence, traveled to Babylon and Egypt, studying at Heliopolis, where he learned the “priestly wisdom” and astrology. According to Pliny, Eudoxus “wished magic [the cult of the Magi] to be recognized as the most noble and useful of the schools of philosophy.” 15 In the Laws , Plato proposed astrological ideas, about which E. R. Dodds, who is skeptical of the extent of Magian influence on Plato’s thought, is willing to concede that: ...the proposals of the Laws do seem to give the heavenly bodies a religious importance which they lacked in ordinary Greek cult, though there may have been partial precedents in Pythagorean thought and usage. And in the Epinomis , which I am inclined to regard either as Plato’s own work or as put together by his Nachlass (unpublished works), we meet with something that is certainly Oriental, and is frankly presented as such, the proposal for public worship of the planets. 16 The Epinomis , which is either a work of Plato, or his pupil Philip of Opus, is clearly influenced by the Magi. According to the Epinomis , that science which makes men most wise, is astrology. Astrology, claims the author, proffers man with knowledge of numbers, in other words, numerology, without which man cannot attain to a knowledge of virtue. This knowledge, according to the author, belonged originally to the Egyptians and the Syrians, “from when the knowledge has reached to all countries, including our own, after having been tested by thousands of years and time without end.”"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"The Kabbalah 21 However, the great treatise of Kabbalistic thought in the Greek language is the Timaeus . Like the Epinomis, the Timaeus categorizes the purpose of life as to study astrology. But, it is in the Republic that Plato articulates the need for a totalitarian state to be governed by philosopher-kings, who are to be instructed in this pseudo-science. When asked to provide details about this instruction, in last chapter of The Republic , Plato recounts what is called the Myth of Er . Er, the son of an Asian named Armenius [or Armenian], who died in a war but returned to life to act as a messenger from the other world. Colotes, a philosopher of the third century BC, accused Plato of plagiarism, maintaining that he substituted Er’s name for that of Zoroaster. Clement of Alexandria and Proclus quote from a work entitled On Nature , attributed to Zoroaster, in which he is equated with Er. 17 Quoting the opening of the work, Clement mentions: Zoroaster, then, writes: “These things I wrote, I Zoroaster, the son of Armenius, a Pamphylian by birth: having died in battle, and been in Hades, I learned them of the gods.” This Zoroaster, Plato says, having been placed on the funeral pyre, rose again to life in twelve days. He alludes perchance to the resurrection, or perchance to the fact that the path for souls to ascension lies through the twelve signs of the zodiac; and he himself says, that the descending pathway to birth is the same. In the same way we are to understand the twelve labours of Hercules, after which the soul obtains release from this entire world. 18 The Republic provided the basis for modern fascist projects of the Illuminati, including the elimination of marriage and the family, compulsory education, the use of eugenics by the state, and the employment of deceptive propaganda methods. According to Plato, “all these women shall be wives in common to all the men, and not one of them shall live privately with any man; the children too should be held in common so that no parent shall know which is his own offspring, and no child shall know his parent” 19 This belief is associated with a need for eugenics, as “the best men must cohabit with the best women in as many cases as possible and the worst with the worst in the fewest, and that the offspring of the one must be reared and that of the other not, if the flock is to be as perfect as possible.” More pernicious still is his prescription for infanticide: “The offspring of the inferior, and any of those of the other sort who are born defective, they will properly dispose of in secret, so that no one will know what has become of them. That is the condition of preserving the purity of the guardians’ breed.” Compulsory schooling is to be implemented in order to separate children from their parents, to have them indoctrinated in the ideals of the state: They [philosopher-kings] will begin by sending out into the country all the inhabitants of the city who are more than ten years old, and will take"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 22 possession of their children, who will be unaffected by the habits of their parents; these they will train in their own habits and laws, I mean in the laws which we have given them: and in this way the State and constitution of which we were speaking will soonest and most easily attain happiness, and the nation which has such a constitution will gain most. 20 As for propaganda, according to Plato, “Our rulers will find a considerable dose of falsehood and deceit necessary for the good of their subjects”. He further explains, “Rhetoric ... is a producer of persuasion for belief, not for instruction in the matter of right and wrong. And so the rhetorician’s business is not to instruct a law court or a public meeting in matters of right and wrong, but only to make them believe; since, I take it, he could not in a short while instruct such a mass of people in matters so important.” 21 Alexander the Great In the year 367 BC, at the age of seventeen, Aristotle had become a member of Plato’s Academy, while Eudoxus of Cnidus was its head. And though Aristotle probably did not write the work On the Magi attributed to him, he was convinced that the planets and the fixed stars influenced life on earth. Aristotle, was then the teacher of Alexander the Great, whose conquests incepted what is known as the Hellenistic Age, a period that saw the penetration of Greaco-Kabbalistic culture throughout much of the Mediterranean world. The Hellenistic Age was also the beginning of the first identifiable contacts between Greeks and Jews. Clearchus of Soli, a disciple of Aristotle, maintained that his master had conversed with a Jew, and that his master claimed that, “as he had lived with many learned men, he communicated to us more information than he received from us. 22 As well, according to both the Talmud and Josephus’ Antiquities , the High Priest of the Temple in Jerusalem, fearing that Alexander would destroy the city, went out to meet him. The narrative describes how Alexander, upon seeing the High Priest, dismounted and bowed to him. In Josephus’ account, when asked by his general, to explain his actions, Alexander answered, “I did not bow before him, but before that God who has honored him with the high Priesthood; for I saw this very person in a dream, in this very apparel.” Alexander interpreted the vision of the High Priest as a good omen and thus spared Jerusalem, peacefully absorbing the Land of Israel into his growing empire. As tribute to his benign conquest, the Sages decreed that the Jewish firstborn of that time be named Alexander, which remains a Jewish name to this very day. 23 After his death, Alexander’s generals broke up the empire, establishing realms of their own.

This network was centered around the House of Herod, and included an important Armenian bloodline. The importance of this Armenian bloodline figures both in their supposed descent from the Lost Tribe, and their mixed Alexandrian and Persian heritage, a hereditary Syrian priesthood of Baal, and the family of Julius Caesar. It was the coalescence of these families, at the turn of the first Millennium BC, that effectively incepted the conspiracy. And, while the trail of these familial relationships is complicated and detailed, it is essential to examine them, in order to properly understand the origin, direction and beliefs of their successors, the Illuminati. Essentially, these families were responsible for the formation and spread of the Mithraism, the most popular cult of the Roman Empire. It was this cult that remained the core doctrine of the Illuminati for centuries to come. Initially, the formation of Mithraism served a conspiracy to supplant the Christian Church. It was ultimately successful, when one of their descendants, Constantine the Great, implemented Catholicism, which was but an assimilation of Mithraism, associating Jesus with the cult of the dying-god. The cult eventually penetrated to the Islamic world to produce the heresy of the Ismailis, from which emerged the first terrorist network, the Assassins. It was the legend of contact with the Assassins with the notorious Knights Templars, during the Crusades, which became the basis of Scottish Rite Freemaonsry. Initially, the cult of the heretical Magi was most prevalent in that part of Asia Minor, that is, of Armenia, Cappadocia and Pontus. Pontus was founded following the death of Alexander the Great, shortly after 302 BC. As the greater part of this kingdom lay within the immense region of Cappadocia, which in early ages extended from the borders of Cilicia to the Black Sea, the kingdom as a whole was at first called “Cappadocia towards the Pontus”, but afterwards simply “Pontus”. Pontus included not only Pontic Cappadocia, but also Colchis, and Lesser Armenia. 3 : Mithraism"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 26 Therefore, this cult of the Magi, which worshipped the dying-god in the form of Mithras, was most prevalent in that part of Asia Minor to which the so-called Lost Tribes had been relocated, to be later absorbed by Scythians and Medes. As to the origin of Mithraism, Franz Cumont indicated, in Oriental Religions in Roman Paganism: These two authors agree then in fixing in Asia Minor the origin of this Persian religion that later spread over the Occident, and in fact various indications direct us to that country. The frequency of the name Mithradates, for instance, in the dynasties of Pontus, Cappadocia, Armenia and Commagene, connected with the Achemenides by fictitious genealogies, shows the devotion of those kings to Mithra. 1 Scholars have since rejected Cumont’s thesis that Mithraism began in Asia Minor, because they are insufficiently familiar with his theory, and the specifics of the cult of the heretical Magi. Finding no instances of specifically Zoroastrian influence in Mithraism, they fail to recognize these mystery rites derived instead from a corrupted form of that religion. Scholars now believe the cult was entirely a production of Roman times, and no earlier than the late first century AD. Unfortunately, they have not properly studied the evidence to recognize that, though forbidden in orthodox Zoroastrianism, the Magi of Asia Minor were described by ancient authors as practicing occult mystery rites, from as early as the sixth century BC. More recently, however, Roger Beck has submitted an intermediary theory. Beck’s theory accommodates the possibility of an early form of Mithraism, practiced among the Magi of Asia Minor, as described by Franz Cumont, but which would have been modified significantly in Roman times. Specifically, Beck located the transformation of this early mystery cult in Commagene, to serve the specific interests of its ruling dynasty. Commagene was a small kingdom, located in modern south-central Turkey, in what had once been part of greater Cappadocia, with its capital city as Samosata, or modern Samsat, near the Euphrates. Commagene was ruled by a dynasty known as the Orontids. The dynasty was founded by Orontes, who had been appointed by the Persians as “satrap”, or governor of Armenia. In 401 BC, Artaxerxes II, then reigning Emperor of Persia, gave him his daughter Rhodogoune in marriage. Artaxerxes II would have been the grandson of Xerxes, who according to Jewish tradition, married Esther, of the Book of Esther. In the Book of Esther, Ahasuerus, usually identified with Xerxes, is married to Vashti, whom he puts aside after she rejects his offer to visit him during a feast. Mordecai’s cousin Hadassah is selected from the candidates to be the kings new wife, and she assumes the name of Esther. His prime minister Haman, and his wife Zeresh, plot to have Ahasuerus kill all the Jews, without knowing that Esther is Jewish. Esther warns Ahasuerus of the plot, Haman"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Mithraism 27 is hanged, and Mordecai becomes prime minister in his place. However, Ahasuerus’ edict decreeing the murder of the Jews cannot be rescinded, so he issues another edict allowing the Jews to kill their enemies, which they do. In the late nineteenth century, some critics developed the theory that the Book of Esther was actually a story derived from Babylonian mythology, representing the triumph of the Babylonian deities Marduk, another name for Bel, and his goddess-spouse, Ishtar, over the deities of Elam. Esther is an Aramaic name for the goddess Ishtar. Mordecai means “servant of Marduk”, Marduk being another name for Bel, the chief god of the Babylonians. The description in the Book of Esther of the parade through the streets dressed in royal robes, the mock combat and other happenings are similar to the Babylonian celebration of the New Year, held in Spring, the original Easter ceremony of the dying-god. This celebration featured mock combat between one team representing the old year, and other team representing the New Year, with the old year being hanged in effigy. Apparently, Jews also took part in this New Year celebration, and eventually the story of Esther had been invented to explain the celebration and to turn it into a Jewish celebration, much as Christians were to change pagan holidays into Christian holidays. 2 In 1923, Dr. Jacob Hoschander wrote The Book of Esther in the Light of History, in which he proposed that the events of the book occurred during the reign of Artaxerxes II, as part of a struggle between adherents of the still monotheistic Zoroastrianism, and those who wanted to bring back the Magian worship of Mithra and Anahita. The Armenian kingdom of Commagene arose in 162 BC, when its governor Ptolemy broke free from the disintegrating Seleucid Empire. Ptolemy’s son Mithradates I Callinicus of Commagene embraced the Hellenistic culture and married Laodice, a Seleucid princess. Thus, their son, Antiochus I of Commagene, who lived from 69 BC to 40 BC, could claim dynastical ties with both Alexander the Great and the Persian kings. The combined heritage found in Antiochus led to the assimilation of Mithras with the Greek Hercules, which marked the first early form of the Mithraic cult. As Franz Cumont explained: This reverence for Persian customs, inherited from legendary ancestors, this idea that piety is the bulwark of the throne and the sole condition of success, is explicitly affirmed in the pompous inscription engraved on the colossal tomb that Antiochus I., Epiphanes, of Commagene (69-34 B.C.), erected on a spur of the mountain-range Taurus, commanding a distant view of the valley of the Euphrates (Figure I). But, being a descendant by his mother of the Seleucidæ of Syria, and supposedly by his father of Darius, son of Hystaspes, the king of Commagene merged the memories of his double origin, and blended together the gods and the rites of the Persians and the Greeks, just as in his own dynasty the name of Antiochus alternated with that of Mithridates. 3"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 28 Antiochus is most famous for founding the sanctuary of Nemrud Dagi, an enormous complex on a mountain-top, featuring giant statues of the king surrounded by gods, each god being a synthesis of Greek and Persian gods, where Apollo is equated with Mithras, Helios and Hermes. The gods are flanked by the heraldic symbols of a lion and an eagle. Scholars dismiss the fact that this cult could represent an early form of Mithraism. However, Mithridates VI of Pontus, the grandson of Mithridates III, who ruled between 120 and 63 BC, was allied to the pirates of Cilicia, a province bordering Commagene. According to Plutarch, who lived in the first century AD, these pirates were responsible for transmitting the mysteries of Mithras to the Romans. According to Plutarch, these were the pirates who constituted such a threat to Rome until Pompey drove them from the seas. In his biography of this general, Plutarch writes of the pirates: “They brought to Olympus in Lycia strange offerings and performed some secret mysteries, which still in the cult of Mithras, first made known by them [the pirates]”. Mithradates, meaning “gift of Mithras”, was one of Rome’s most formidable and successful enemies. His demise is detailed in the play Mithridates of 1673 by Jean Racine, which formed the basis for many eighteenth century operas, including one of Freemason Mozart’s earliest, known most commonly by its Italian name, Mitridate, re di Ponto, written in 1770. When Mithradates VI was defeated by the Roman general Pompey the Great in 65 BC, in the last of a series of three Mithridatic Wars, remnants of his army took refuge among the Cilician pirates. In the middle of the second century A.D. the historian Appian adds that the pirates came to know of the mysteries from the troops who were left behind by the defeated army of Mithridates VI. 4 The Mithraic Bloodline The House of Commagene combined with the family of Herod the Great, the Syrian priest-kings of Baal, and the family of Julius Caesar. Together, they took the early symbolism of the Mithra worship of the heretical Magi, and combined it with the emerging Kabbalistic mysticism, to form the Mysteries of Mithras. Essentially, the Mithraic mysteries adapted the ancient king-worship of the Babylonians, to the worship of the emperor, as a personification of their god the Sun. Through the influence of the Commagenian dynasty, this cult retained its Persian themes, but represented its god Mithras with the physical form of their progenitor, Alexander the Great. The reciprocal worship attributed to Alexander and Darius as representatives of god as the Sun, is mentioned in a work falsely ascribed to Callisthenes, an advisor to Alexander. The text underwent numerous expansions and revisions throughout Antiquity and the Middle Ages, and provided the basis for other versions developed in all the major languages of"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Mithraism 29 Europe and the Middle East. According to the text: Alexander then seeing the great pomp of Darius was moved almost to worship him as Mithra the divine, as though clothed in barbaric splendor he had come down from heaven, - such was his splendid array. Darius was seated upon a lofty throne, with a crown of most precious stones, wearing a robe of Babylonian silk inwoven with golden thread. [according to the Syriac version] And when Darius saw Alexander he did obeisance and worshipped Alexander, for he believed that he was Mihr [Mithras] the god, and that he had come down to bring aid to the Persians. For his raiment was like that of the gods, and the crown which rested upon his head shone with rays of light and the robe with he wore was woven with fine gold. 5 The person through which the House of Commagene was able to enter into contact with that of Herod, in addition to the family of Julius Ceasar, to produce the Mithraic bloodline, which went on to produce the leading conspiratorial families of Europe, was Antiochus IV. Antiochus IV’s great- grandfather, Antiochus I of Commagene had supported Pompey against the Parthians, and in 64 BC was rewarded with additional territories. After submitting to Greek rule under the Seleucids, the Persian Empire eventually reemerged under the Parthians, a semi-nomadic people who, in the second century BC, arose from an area southeast of the Caspian Sea. It was ruled by the Arsacids, who claimed descent from the Persian king Artaxerxes II. Through the conquests of Mithradates I and Artabanus II in the second century BC, the Parthians established control over Iran and expanded westward into Mesopotamia. Antiochus I was able to deflect Roman attacks from Mark Antony, whom he eventually joined in the Roman civil war, but after Antony’s defeat to Augustus, Commagene was made a Roman client state. This state of affairs signaled the beginning of the relationships that led to the transference of the Mithraic cult to Rome. Augustus, who ruled the Roman Empire from 27 BC to 68 AD, was the first of the Julio-Claudian dynasty, followed by Tiberius, Caligula, and Claudius, until the last of the line, Nero, who committed suicide. The dynasty is so named because its members were drawn from the Julia and the Claudius family. Julia derive their name from Iulus, or Julus, also known as Ascanius, who, according to Greek and Roman mythology, was a son of Aeneas, himself the son of Aphrodite, the Greek Venus, and the cousin of Priam. The name “Ascanius” is thought to have been derived from Ashkenazi, or Ashkuza, the name given to the Scytians by the ancient Akkadians. 6 After the Trojan War, Ascanius escaped to Latium in Italy and had a role in the founding of Rome as the first king of Alba Longa. The founder of the dynasty, Caesar Augustus, was a Julian through his adoption by his great-uncle, Julius Caesar. "},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 30 In 17 AD, Tiberius deposed Antiochus I’ successor, Antiochus III, but Caligula reinstated his son Antiochus IV of Commagene, and even enlarged his territory. And, although Caligula deposed him shortly after, he was again restored by Claudius in in 41 AD. In 52 AD, Antiochus VI campaigned against some wild tribes there which had been harrowing the coastal cities. And Beck considers that, “it is worth considering whether the germination of the Mysteries might not have taken place when Commagenean and Cilician Mithra-worship coalesced at the exposure of Commagenean administrators and military to the rites of the Cilician tribes.” Antiochus IV’s associate, Caligula, was influenced by the Babylonian or Mithraic tradition of worshipping the king as embodiment of the sun-god, and cult which he tried to institute in the Roman Empire. In addition, reflecting the characteristics of his occult leanings, Caligula was described, by H. H. Scullard, a former professor of ancient history at King’s College, as a “monster of lust and diabolical cruelty”. 7 According to an article in Wikipedia: Under Augustus, the Cult of the Deified Emperor had been established and promoted, especially in the western empire, and was generally the first organization established in any new Roman colony. Augustus proclaimed on multiple occasions that he was not himself personally divine; instead the Cult centered around his numen, his personal spirit, and gens, the collective spirit of his family and ancestors. After Augustus, Tiberius seems to have had little interest in the Cult, and its promulgation and expansion seems to have been on a local level and driven by local magistrates, rather than from a central organizational structure. Caligula expanded this Cult on an unprecedented scale. The temple of Castor and Pollux on the Forum was linked directly to the Imperial residence on the Palatine and dedicated to Caligula himself; he would appear here on occasions, dressed and presenting himself as a god, and demanding that those in his presence adopt sycophantic methods of aknowledging him. The nature of the Cult of the Deified Emperor changed from honoring the spirits around the Emperor to direct worship of Caligula himself. Likewise, Caligula’s policies affected religious practice in the whole of the Empire, not just those practices associated with the Cult. The heads of the statues of many of the gods throughout Rome and the empire were replaced with Caligula’s head, including many of the female statues, and Caligula demanded that he be worshipped as an embodiment of these gods, similar to the Hellenistic ruler-cults. A plan to place a statue of himself as Zeus in the Holy of Holies in the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem was halted only after the intervention of Herod Agrippa, a personal friend of Caligula. 8 Caligula, like Antiochus IV, was also a close friend of Herod Agrippa, king of Judea, also called the Great, who lived from 10 BC to 44 AD. Herod Agrippa was the king named “Herod” in the Acts of the Apostles, in the Bible. He was the grandson of Herod the Great, rebuilder of the Temple. Herod the Great arose from a wealthy, influential Idumaean family. The Idumaeans"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Mithraism 31 were successors to the Edomites, who had settled in Edom in southern Judea, but between 130-140 BC, were required to convert to Judaism. According to Josephus, after the murder of his father, young Agrippa was sent by Herod the Great to the imperial court in Rome. There, Tiberius conceived a great affection for him, and he eventually became a close friend of Caligula. And on the assassination of Caligula in 41AD, Agrippa’s advice helped to secure the ascension as emperor Claudius, who was also the grandson of Mark Antony and Octavia, and who eventually made Herod Agrippa governor of Judea. Along with Commagene and the Julio-Claudian families, a third would be introduced into this mix, which would feature in not only the creation of Mithraism, but its continued preservation through the centuries, culminating in the Illuminati families of Europe. That family was the hereditary priest-kings of Emesa. The Royal Family of Emesa, today Hims in Syria, was a dynasty of Priest-Kings who formed a powerful and influential aristocracy. Emesa was renowned for the Temple of the Sun, known as Elagabalus, a derivation of Baal, adored in a shape of a black stone. Around 64 BC, Pompey the Great had reorganized Syria and the surrounding countries into Roman Provinces, and had installed client kings, who would be allies to Rome. One of those client kings, would be Sampsiceramus, the founding member of the Priest-King dynasty of Emesa. Herod Agrippa gave his sister Drusilla in marriage to Azizus, King of Emesa. She had already been married to Epiphanes, the son of Antiochus I of Commagene. However, Herod had stipulated that Epiphanes should embrace the Jewish religion. Epiphanes finally refused. Azizus, in order to obtain Drusilla’s hand, consented to be circumcised. She later divorced him, though, to marry Felix Antonius, the Procurator of Judea. In 54 AD, after the death of Claudius, and during political strife within Armenia, the Parthian king Vologases I, the great-great-grandson of Antiochus I of Commagene, placed his own brother Tiridates I on the Armenian throne. This invariably led to war, since it was Rome, and not Parthia who held the right of Armenian succession. Over the next several years, Roman legions, led by the general Corbulo, invaded Armenia and the two powers fought a virtual stalemate. From 59 to 63 AD, the Romans installed Tigranes VI as King of Armenia. Tigranes was the son of Alexander, grandson of Herod the Great. His mother was the great-granddaughter of Mark Antony and Antonia. Tigranes VI married Julia, the heiress of the Edomite royal bloodline, the daughter of Herod Phollio King of Chalcis, grandson of Herod the Great. Their son Alexander of Cilicia married Iotape of Commagene, the daughter of Antiochus IV. By AD 63, however, a peace treaty was negotiated in which Tiridates would lay down his crown, hence surrendering the Parthian right to place him on the throne, but it was agreed that he would travel to Rome where Nero himself would give him the throne under Roman authority. At the coronation Tiridates declared that he had come “in order to revere you [Nero] as Mithras” 9 . In the same visit, according to Pliny, Tiridates “the Magus” brought Magi with him and “initiated him [Nero] into magical feasts [mystery rites]”. 10"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 32 The Jewish Revolt These several families also contributed to the Roman attempt to suppress a Jewish revolt in Palestine, which culminated in the capture of Jerusalem. It was among the Roman troops, who participated in this campaign, that we find the first dissemination of Kabbalistic ideas in the form of mysteries dedicated to Mithras, though attributed to the Magi. Between the years 67 to 70 AD, the Fifteenth Apollonian Legion, which had followed Corbulo against the Parthians in Armenia, was sent to Palestine to suppress the Jewish revolt. The Fifteenth Apollonian legion of the Roman army was originally formed by Julius Caesar in 53 BC, but was destroyed in Africa in the autumn of 49/48 BC. The legion was again founded in 41 or 40 BC, by Caesar’s heir Octavian, who chose the surname Apollinaris, because he worshipped Apollo above all other gods. Under Roman occupation, though rebellion had been sporadic, disturbances among the Jews of Palestine were frequent. Soon, the Roman procurator Florus lost control of the situation. However, in 67 AD, the future emperor Vespasian and his son Titus, had arrived with the Apollonian legion, and by the end of the year, Galilee was captured. Judea was reduced in three campaigns which ended with the fall of Jerusalem in 70 AD, when 97,000 Jews, according to Josephus, were taken captive. 11 Jerusalem was destroyed and became the permanent garrison town of a Roman legion. The Temple itself was sacked and the sacred contents of its inner sanctuary, the Holy of Holies, were carried back to Rome. As depicted on Titus’ triumphal arch, these treasures included the immense gold seven-branched candelabrum, so sacred to Judaism, and possibly even the Ark of the Covenant. The Apollonian legion then accompanied Emperor Titus to Alexandria, where they were joined by new recruits from Cappadocia. It seems to have been a curious mix of these several elements, after the Legion had been transported to Germany, that erected their first temple dedicated to Mithras on the banks of the Danube. 12 The Romans’ allies in suppressing the revolt had also included, not only Herod Agrippa, and Antiochus VI of Commagene, but Soaemus of Emesa. Soaemus was the grandson of Aristobulus II of Emesa, the grandson of Herod the Great, who married Iotape, the daughter of Sampsiceramus, the founding king of Emesa. As Beck noted, Commagenian military elements, under royal command, were also engaged in the suppression of the Jewish Revolt, and there would have been extensive contact with Roman legionary and other troops, including those units identified among the earlier carriers of the new mystery cult, like the Fifteenth Apollonian. According to Beck, therefore, “what I propose, then, is that the Mysteries of Mithras were developed within a subset of these Commagenian soldiers and family-retainers and were transmitted by them at various points of contact to their counterparts in the Roman world.” 13 "},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Mithraism 33 Antiochus IV reigned until 72 AD, when Vespasian deposed the dynasty. The dynasty, after its deposition, was resident for a period in Rome. As Beck points out, “Antiochus was no stranger to the city; it was presumably there that, together with Herod Agrippa of Judaea, he “associated with” (syneinai) Caligula, a relationship which the Romans observed with dismay, considering the pair of client princes “mentors in tyranny”. 14 Specifically, Beck attributes the formulation of the Mithraic cult to Ti. Claudius Balbillus, who was both the leading astrologer of the period in Rome, and related by marriage, possibly by blood too, to the Commagenian dynasty. Balbillus had also been a prefect of Egypt, and served as head of the Museum and Library of Alexandria. It is generally agreed that Balbillus was the father-in- law of Iulius Antiochus Epiphanes, the son of Antiochus IV. Scholars also accept that Balbillus was the son of the leading astrologer of the previous generation, Ti. Claudius Thrasyllus, who may also have married a Commagenian princess. The Mysteries of Mithras The Mysteries of the Mithras that came to pervade the Roman world were purportedly of Magian origin. However, the role of the House of Herod in its formation suggests a possible origin for the evident relationship that exists between them and the emerging form of early Jewish Kabbalah, known as Merkabah mysticism. The source of this early Kabbalistic influence would be the occult Jewish community of the Essenes, who, throughout the history of the Illuminati, would be regarded as a source of their doctrines. The means through which this tradition was supposedly transmitted to the West during the Crusades, was through the heretical Ismailis of Egypt. Though the Essenes were located in Palestine, their influence was spread to Egypt through a related community, known as the Therapeutae. Although Rome came to dominate the scene politically, it was the city of Alexandria in Egypt, that would continue to dominate culturally. Due to the numerous cultures that congregated in the city, whether Egyptian, Greek, Persian, Indian or Jewish, new esoteric creeds were formulated based on older traditions. These various schools held in common a type of mysticism, which some scholars term Gnosticism. More correctly, these variations represented aspects of a single school, that is, Kabbalah, exercised through the influence of the substantial Jewish community that existed in the city. As Franz Cumont remarked, a great number of Jewish colonies were scattered everywhere on the Mediterranean, and “the Jews, who were acquainted with the arcana of the Irano-Chaldean doctrines and proceedings, made some of the recipes known wherever the dispersion brought them.” 15 Founded when Alexander assigned them a quarter of the city of their own, Alexandria became the most important Jewish community of the"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 34 Diaspora. The Roman geographer Strabo, who said that the Jews were a power throughout the inhabited world, indicated that there were a million of them in Egypt alone. They formed a majority of the population in two out of five quarters of the city, occupied a quarter of their own, and enjoyed the highest status of any non-Greeks and possessed considerable autonomy. The Therapeutae derived their doctrines from the more famous group in Palestine, the Essenes. The Essenes were one of three main philosophical Jewish sects, the other two being the Pharisees and the Sadducees. The Essenes were regarded by their contemporaries as the heirs of Chaldean and Egyptian astronomy, and the medicine of the ancient Persians, and Philo of Alexandria compared them with the Persian Magi and the Indian Yogi. 16 Today, more is known about the community since the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls, which scholars are generally agreed belonged originally to the Essenes. According to Scholem, a leading scholar of Kabbalah, it was in apocalyptic literature, examples of which were found among the Dead Sea Scrolls, that contained the earliest evidence among the Jews of the development of Merkabah mysticism. Early Jewish mysticism already incorporated the several tenets that were central to the cult of the Magi, including astrology, numerology and pantheism. However, it is in Merkabah mysticism that we find the first evolution of that doctrine which would become central to all the schools of Hellenistic mysticism, the ascent through the seven planets. This mystical process involved the initiate advancing successively through the seven planetary spheres, in order to remove the astrological influence his soul had received from them on his descent into matter. The purpose of Merkabah mysticism is union with the highest god, interpreted as the vision of the Chariot of God, described in the first chapter of the Book of Ezekiel. Supporting the chariot, Ezekiel described four “creatures”, each with a human body, two sets of wings and cloven feet like that of a calf. Each creature had four faces, of a man, lion, ox and eagle, understood esoterically to represent the four seasons and elements of the zodiac. The man is Aquarius or air, the lion is Leo or fire, the ox is Taurus or earth, and the eagle is Scorpio or water. The four wings are the four winds. The creatures are set on wheels, each like “a wheel inside a wheel,” referring to the intersection of the zodiac and the celestial equator. Merkabah texts involved elaborate anthropomorphic descriptions of God, known as Shiur Komah, which were based on the Song of Solomon. The most important of all Kabbalistic texts, and from which most of its symbolism is derived, the Song of Solomon, or Song of Songs, is a collection of love poems spoken alternately by a man and a woman, a number of which describe the beauty and excellence of the beloved. To Rabbi Akiva, the great exponent of Merkabah, as for later Jews, the Song was regarded as an allegory, interpreted as a dialogue of love between the Shekinah, the nation of the Israelites, with"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Mithraism 35 whom God has made His sacred covenant, and God. The beloved, or the Shekinah, is the Kabbalah’s interpretation of the goddess. In the Song she is described as bride, daughter and sister. Originally, she is the planet Venus, the goddess of love and war of Antiquity. If Mithraism was developed for the House of Commagene, then the Kabbalistic elements of Merkabah found in it must have been introduced by the House of Herod. Herod Agrippa also gave special favor to the Essenes. From Flavius Josephus, we learn: Among those spared from being forced [to take a loyalty oath to Herod] were those we call Essenes . . . . It is worth saying what caused [Herod] to honor the Essenes. There was a certain Essene whose name was Manaemus . . . . This man once saw Herod when the latter, still a boy, was on the way to his teacher’s house, and addressed him as ‘King of the Jews.’ Herod thought he was ignorant or joking and reminded him that he was a private citizen. But Manaemus smiled gently and tapped him with his hand on the rump, saying: ‘But indeed you will be king and you will rule happily, for you have been found worthy by God. 17 The ascent through the seven “palaces”, or planets, of Merkabah mysticism seems to have been introduced to the primitive mystery rites the heretical Magi, forming the Roman Mysteries of Mithras, spread far and wide by the Roman soldiers, and through Mithraism, to the other schools of Hellenistic mysticism. Ezekiel’s vision held striking similarities to the Mithraic image of the Leontocephalus, as well as to the Orphic Phanes. According to the Orphic Theogonies, Phanes, identified with Kronos, or Time, and equated with Saturn, is described as “a serpent having heads growing upon him of a bull and a lion, and in the middle the face of a god; and he has also wings upon his shoulders, and is called ageless Time, and Herakles the same.” In Orpheus and Greek Religion, W.K.C. Guthrie remarked that, “the depicting of ageless Time himself in this form shows correspondences with Oriental, and in particular with Persian religion, which are too detailed and exact to be passed over.” 18 Much like the “creatures” that support the chariot in Ezekiel, the Leontocephalus is usually depicted as a lion-headed youth, covered in Zodiac signs, with two sets of wings, the feet of a goat, and coiled by a serpent. The Leontocephalus was depicted standing on a globe, on which there are two circles intersecting each other, the “wheel inside a wheel”, which Celsus explained, “is a symbol of the two orbits in heaven, the one being that of the fixed stars and the other that assigned to the planets.” Ultimately, reserved for the highest-ranking members, and representing the ultimate mystery, the Leontocephalus was equated with Mithras, Phanes and Ahriman, the Zoroastrian devil, all as one god. Macrobius recorded that, according to Orpheus: “one Zeus, one Hades [Greek god of the Underworld],"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 36 one Sun, one Dionysus.” 19 The Leontocephalus has also been identified with Saturn. In Armenian texts Saturn is called Zurvan 20 and according to Ptolemy, the people of Persia and Mesopotamia “worship the star of Aphrodite [Venus], naming it Isis, and the star of Kronos [Saturn] as Mithras Helios.” 21 Saturn, known as the nocturnal Sun, and “Pluto”, Porphyry explained, “is the Sun going beneath the earth and voyaging round the invisible world...” 22"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"37 Herod the Great Through the promotion and dissemination of the Mysteries of Mithras, the House of Herod seems to have been involved in a plot to subvert the emerging Christian movement, by altering its doctrines to conform with their own Mithraic teachings, or the death and resurrection of the dying-god. According to the Gospel of Mark, “Be careful,” Jesus warned his disciples, “watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees and that of Herod.” 1 It was also this Herod who, according to the Gospel of Matthew, after having been warned by the Magi of the coming of a “King of the Jews”, ordered the murder of all male children in Bethlehem under the age of two. The power of the Pharisees was exercised through the Sanhedrin, who also seemed to have played an important role in this plot. God commanded Moses to “lay hands”, a rite of ordination known Semicha, on Joshua. It is from this point, according to Rabbinic tradition, that the Sanhedrin began, with seventy elders, headed by Moses, for a total of seventy-one. The Great Sanhedrin was an assembly of the greatest Jewish judges who constituted the supreme court and legislative body of ancient Israel. However, the Sanhedrin lost much of its significance when a powerful king was at the helm. In 47 BC, however, Hyrcanus II was appointed Ethnarch of the Jews, a man devoted to the cause of the Pharisees, and the Sanhedrin was reorganized according to their wishes. One of the first acts of the now all-powerful assembly was to pass judgment upon Herod the Great, accused of cruelty in his government. Therefore, when Herod eventually established his power in Jerusalem in 37 BC, forty-five of his former judges were put to death. According to the Catholic Encyclopedia, though Herod allowed Sanhedrin to continue, “this new Sanhedrin, filled with his creatures, was henceforth utilized as a mere tool at his beck”. 2 According to the New Testament, it was the Sanhedrin which conspired to have Jesus killed, by paying one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, thirty pieces of silver in exchange for his delivery into their hands. Interestingly, a second and distinct meaning of Semicha, practiced by the Sanhedrin, is the 4 : Gnosticism"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 38 laying of hands upon an offering of a sacrifice in the times of the Temple in Jerusalem. This involved pressing firmly on the head of the sacrificial animal, thereby symbolically “transmitting” sins onto the animal. 3 It would seem that the Sanhedrin had conspired to kill Jesus as a form of ritual sacrifice, and as atonement for their sins. This was in keeping with Kabbalistic and Mithraic doctrines, perpetuated by the House of Herod, whereby, human sacrifice was an act pleasing to their god, and was believe to liberate the devotee from sin, that is, from obedience to God. It was Joseph of Arimathea, a member of the Sanhedrin, when heard of Jesus’ death, who requested from Pilate permission to remove the body. Joseph of Arimathea then retrieved the body, and placed it in his own tomb, an act witnessed by Mary Magdalene and “the other Mary”. Then, according to Matthew 27:57-66: The next day, the chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate. “Sir,” they said, “we remember that while he was still alive that deceiver said, “After three days I will rise again.” So give the order for the tomb to be made secure until the third day. Otherwise, his disciples may come and steal the body and tell the people that he has been raised from the dead. This last deception will be worse than the first.” “Take a guard,” Pilate answered. “Go, make the tomb as secure as you know how.” So they went and made the tomb secure by putting a seal on the stone and posting the guard. By this time, Joseph of Arimathea would have already removed the body, and conspired with the two Marys to spread the message that Jesus had resurrected from the dead. Those disciples mentioned in the Gospels as spreading this message were again the two Marys but also Salome. Mary Magdalene is usually identified as the woman out of which Jesus exorcised seven demons, or with Mary of Bethany, and the woman sinner, who anointed Jesus’ feet. She is also identified with the adulterous woman he saved from stoning by the Pharisees. But if Mary Magdalene came to be identified with harlotry, it is because of an esoteric interpretation which regards her as a “sacred prostitute”, who officiates at the mysteries, or as goddess and consort to the “son of god”, as she is featured in the Gnostic texts. There is some contention as to the exact identity of Salome, who appears briefly in the canonical gospels, and who appears in more detail in apocryphal writings. However, one Salome was the step-daughter of Herod Antipas, and danced before Herod and her mother Herodias at the occasion of Herod’s birthday, and by doing so caused the death of John the Baptist. According to Josephus’ Jewish Antiquities: Herodias, [...], was married to Herod, the son of Herod the Great, who was born of Mariamne, the daughter of Simon the high priest, who had a daughter, Salome; after whose birth Herodias took upon her to confound the laws of our"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Gnosticism 39 country, and divorced herself from her husband while he was alive, and was married to Herod, her husband’s brother by the father’s side, he was tetrarch of Galilee; but her daughter Salome was married to Philip, the son of Herod, and tetrarch of Trachonitis; and as he died childless, Aristobulus, the son of Herod, the brother of Agrippa, married her; they had three sons, Herod, Agrippa, and Aristobulus. 4 The purpose of this mission would be that, contrary to Jesus would be interpreted as the “Son of God”, and believed to have died and risen again. This would have been in accordance with the same mystery doctrines that had so plagued the orthodox tradition that Jesus was trying to uphold. To those initiates who could be duped into higher levels, however, they would be instructed of the real meaning of the interpretation, where Jesus was equated as the enemy of their “god”, Lucifer, and believed to have been killed as a form of ritual sacrifice. This esoteric interpretation came to be known as Gnosticism, and became the basis through which the Western occult tradition subverted Christianity, and secretly inculcated the worship of Lucifer. Paul the Gnostic The agent responsible for the formulation and spread this Gnostic interpretation of Christianity, was Paul, the Thirteenth Apostle. Paul has otherwise been thought of as having been an ardent enemy of the Gnostic tradition. Gnosticism is currently being popularized, by works like Brown’s Da Vinci Code, and scholars like Elaine Pagels, as merely an alternative, and possibly purer, form of Christianity. This notion has, however, been disproven by the most recent scholarship on the subject. As Moshe Idel indicates, “far more than did scholars in the first half of the twentieth century, contemporary scholars of Gnosticism refer to Jewish influence on the emerging Gnostic literature; the studies of Gilles Quispel, George MacRae, B. Pearson, Gedalliahu Stroumsa, and Jarl Fossum have altered the earlier Iranian-Egyptian-Greek explanations of Gnosticism.” 5 Specifically, the Jewish influence Idel is referring to is that of Merkbah. Essentially, the diffusion of Merkabah ideas into Greek and Roman culture, resulted in the emergence of several mystical schools, namely Neoplatonism, Hemeticism and Gnosticism. Scholars have recognized the similarities in these systems, but have mistakenly attributed them to what they term as “syncretism”, meaning that they “influenced” each other. A more correct way to perceive them is that they were merely branches of a single system. The core teachings were found in Merkabah, but were known outwardly to the Roman world as Mithraism. The alchemical symbolism of Mithraism was found in Hermeticism, said to derive from a supposed ancient Egyptian sage known as Hermes Trismegistus. The interpretation of these mysteries was offered in a school of philosophy known as Neoplatonism, believed to derive"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 40 originally from Plato. When these ideas were melded to the emerging Christian movement, they produced the heresy of Gnosticism. Despite numerous attempts to apologize for Gnosticism as being merely goddess worship, the Gnostics equated the goddess with Venus. In other words, Lucifer. Gnosticsm was actually an adaptation of the Merkabah’s perception of Lucifer, presented in the mystery terms as the worship of the dying-god. Gnostic doctrine articulated the central rationalization for the the indulgence in evil which has become the basis of Illuminati strategy. In order to worship evil, it is first necessary to elevate it to the level of a god, a notion which the Gnostics borrowed from the primitive dualism of the pagans. According to doctrines of Gnosticism, from which the entire Western occult tradition derives its source, the Bible is to be interpreted in reverse. Though he was a lesser god, in the pantheon of pagan gods, God sought to proclaim himself the sole god. Therefore, God, who created the world, is evil. After having created humanity, he was oppressive in his insistence of rules of morality. Supposedly then, it is the devil, or Lucifer, identified with the dying- god, who “liberated” man by instructing him in the truth: the Kabbalah. The followers of Jesus had persisted in Jerusalem following the crucifixion, where they were known as the Early Church, or Nazarenes, and were headed by James, the “brother of the Lord”. In compliance with the mission of Jesus, as set out in Matthew, they were strict adherents of the Law. On the contrary, Paul imposed a mystical interpretation of the religion, whereby Jesus was equated with the dying-god of the mysteries, who was believed to have died for the sins of mankind, and therefore, it was permitted not to follow the ancient Law. Thus, Paul’s Gentile converts were permitted to reject circumcision. It was this matter that brought him into direct conflict with the Early Church of Jerusalem, who attempted to suppress his deviations. Paul seems to have been part of a conspiracy on the part of the House of Herod, to subvert the emerging Christian movement, by conforming it to their occult doctrines. Paul was from Tarsus, the capitol city of Cilicia, the very hub of the intrigues that produced the Mithraic religion. In addition, according to Robert Eisenmen, in Paul as a Herodian, there is evidence, in the New Testament, early Church literature, Rabbinic literature, and Josephus, to suggest some connection between Paul and so-called “Herodians.” Eisenmen concludes: Though these matters are hardly capable of proof, and we have, in fact, proved nothing, still no other explanations better explain the combination of points we raise. One thing cannot be denied, Paul’s Herodian connections make the manner of his sudden appearances and disappearances, his various miraculous escapes, his early power in Jerusalem, his Roman citizenship, his easy relations with kings and governors, and the venue and terms of his primary missionary activities comprehensible in a manner no other reconstruction even approaches. 6"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Gnosticism 41 According to Eisenmen, Paul’s rejection of the Law is representative of the liberal attitudes of the Herodians to religious law, and their pro-Roman policies. Paul speaks in an unguarded moment in Rom 16:11 of his “kinsman Herodion.” The reference immediately preceding the one to “Herodion” in Rom 16:10, i.e., is to a certain “household of Aristobulus,” being that there were two or three Aristobuluses in the Herodian family, from different lines living at the same time. In particular, Paul’s repudiation of the Law rejected the necessity of circumcision for converts. This was an issue particularly sensitive for the Herodians, who were in the practice of forging various dynastic alliances with non-Jews in Cilicia and Lower Armenia, including Commagene. In addition to Drusilla, there was also the case of Monobazus’ mother Helen, Queen of Adiabene, later part of Armenia, and Polemos of Cilicia, whom Bernice, the daughter of Herod Agrippa, divorced after he was circumcised. Thus, explains Eisenmen, Paul arrives with funds gathered in overseas fund-raising from many of the areas into which Herodians have expanded and, in part because of this, those areas where circumcision had become such an issue because of the marital practices of Herodian princesses. He notes, The “Christian” community in Antioch, where Christians were first called Christians (Acts 11:26) — a suitable locale for the crystallization of this terminology — comprises, even according to Acts’ dubious historical reckoning, various persons of this “Herodian” mix. Among these one should include the curious “Niger” “Lucius of Cyrene,” who was very likely none other than Paul’s other famous traveling companion Luke, and “Manaen who was a foster-brother of Herod the Tetrarch” (Acts 13:1). 7 Suspiciously, following an unsuccessful conspiracy among forty Jews to assassinate Saint Paul, the Romans decided to send him to Felix in Caesarea. After the death of Herod, Judea was once more added to the great Roman province of Syria to be presided over by governors. Felix was originally a slave, but manumitted and promoted by Caesar, and appointed governor of Judea in 52 AD, and stayed in office until 58 AD. Felix was reputed to be a very cruel and lustful man. He had first been married to Drusilla, the daughter of Ptolemy King of Mauritania, the grandson of Mark Antony and Cleopatra, but later divorced her to marry another Drusilla, the daughter of Herod Agrippa, after she had already been married to Epiphanes, the son of Antiochus IV of Commagene, and then to Azizus, Kind of Emesa. 8 Before Felix, Paul was merely asked from which province he had come. Five days later, members of the Sanhedrin appeared, and made charges, which Paul denied. 9 Felix delayed the proceeding further until Claudias Lysias, the captain of the Roman troops in Jerusalem, could come to give evidence. After a few days, Felix’ wife, Drusilla, the Jewess, wanted to see and hear Paul. Paul appeared and gave the gospel to Felix and Drusilla. Felix trembled but was"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 42 unrepentant. He wanted a bribe from Paul so did not acquit him. Felix kept Paul a prisoner in Caesarea, under loose house arrest, for two years until the arrival of Festus, the new governor. Eisenmen makes note that it is very unlikely that Paul could have made the miraculous escapes without the support of the Herodians and their Roman sponsors. As in, for example, the attack on Paul in the Temple, and his rescue by Roman soldiers witnessing these events from the Fortress of Antonia. 10 This episode, too, makes mention of a nephew and possibly a sister of Paul, resident in Jerusalem, but also presumably carrying Roman citizenship, who warn him of a plot by “zealots for the Law” to kill him. Without this kind of intervention, Paul could never have enjoyed the protection he does in Caesarea, and retired to Rome in such security. Eisenmen also points out that there is reference in Josephus about a member of the Herodian family named “Saulus”, which was not a common name in the period. This Saulus plays a key role in events leading up to the destruction of Jerusalem and the Temple. This Saulus is not only the intermediary between “the men of Power [the Herodians], the principal of the Pharisees, the chief priests, and all those desirous for peace”, in other words, peace with the Romans. Josephus also describes him as “a kinsman of Agrippa.” The mention of Saulus’ relation to “the chief priests” parallels material in Acts, relating to Saul’s commission from the chief priest to arrest “Christians”. Most importantly, it was the Valentinians, chief among the early Gnostic groups, claimed to have received their doctrines from Theudas, a disciple of Paul. Elaine Pagels points out: Instead of repudiating Paul as their obstinate opponent, the Naassenes and Valentinians revere him as the one of the apostles who, above all others, was himself a Gnostic initiate. The Valentinians, in particular, allege that their secret tradition offers direct access to Paul’s own teaching of wisdom and gnosis. According to Clement “they say that Valentinus was a hearer of Theudas, and Theudas, in turn, a disciple of Paul.” 11 As a result of Paul’s mission, Christianity grew among non-Jewish communities, referred to as Gentiles, which became increasingly separated from the teachings of the Nazarenes of Jerusalem. Until, the Nazarene community were eventually treated as a deviant sect. Then, in response to what were perceived as growing heretical tendencies, the emerging orthodoxy stressed their version of the apostolic tradition, by focusing on the gospels and letters of Paul, whereby Jesus was equated with the dying-god of the mysteries, whose death and resurrection were celebrated every Easter."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"43 Britain Though Joseph of Arimathea had already prepared his own tomb, because he was “waiting for the Kingdom of God”, but which he chose to bury Jesus, he lives on for at least another thirty years, and supposedly, around the year 63 AD, he was said to have travelled to England. In the eighth century AD, Rabanus Maurus, Archbishop of Mayence, stated in the Life of Mary Magdalene that Joseph of Arimathea was sent to Britain, and he goes on to detail who traveled with him as far as France, claiming that he was accompanied by, in addition to Mary Magdalene and Lazarus, and again, Salome. 1 With him was the “Holy Grail”, which he concealed for safekeeping at Glastonbury Tor, where he established the first church in Britain Isles, which developed into Glastonbury Abbey. His descendants would eventually culminate in the person of King Arthur. The prominence of Britain in this tale is a mark of its long-standing affiliation with the practice of the occult. Scholars have in fact speculated that, already at the beginning of the first millennium BC, the Phoenicians ventured as far as Britain to exploit the tin trade, connecting them to the religious traditions of the Near East. The Britons traced their descent to Brutus, grandson of Ascanius, who in turn was supposedly descended from Zerah. In addition, according to the ancient chronicles of Ireland, the lineage of the Britons was supplemented in the sixth century BC, with the royal blood of the House of David, resulting in the kings of Scotland. Irish legend maintains that the Scottish originate from Fenius Farsaidh, a descendant of Edom, who founded kingdom of Scythia. 2 Fenius’ son Nel married Scota, an Egyptian. Thus explaining why the name Scoti was applied by the Romans to Irish raiders, and later to the Irish invaders of Argyll and Caledonia, which became known as Scotland. Scota and Nel had a son, Goidel Glas, the eponymous ancestor of the Gaels, who was expelled from Egypt shortly after the Exodus of the Israelites by a pharaoh.

When the Jews were persecuted by Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, Mattaniah, the son of King Josiah, and a direct descendant of King David, was installed in Judah. Known as King Zedekiah, he acceded to the throne of Jerusalem in 598 BC. Twelve years later, Jerusalem fell to Nebuchadnezzar, whereupon Zedekiah was taken to Babylon and blinded, and his sons were murdered, except for his daughter Tamar. Tamar, it is said, arrived with an aged man named Ollam Fodhla, and his secretary, one Simon Brug. These have been identified with the prophet Jeremiah, his scribe Baruch, who, along with the princes Tamar, eventually traveled to Sicily, Spain, possibly even Norway and Denmark, and later, Ireland. Tamar married one of the later Irish Kings, Eochaid I, from which all the High Kings of Ireland descend. She and her companions brought with her a mysterious chest, supposedly the Ark of the Covenant, and a golden-colored banner, emblazoned with the heraldic device of a red Lion, and the Stone of Destiny. 4 The Stone of Destiny, or the Stone of the Covenant, became known as Lia Fail. It is believed to be the original Pillar that Jacob dedicated to God after his all-night wrestling vigil with an angel. The Stone was installed at the stronghold at the Hill of Tara, where it served as the place of coronation for all the early Irish kings. As early as the first centuries AD, it was believed that the Celts learned the arts of the Magi through the students of Pythagoras. 5 According to Pliny the Elder, in the first century AD, magic, meaning the cult of the Magi, was so entrenched in Britain that he said it would almost seem as if it was the British who had taught it to the Babylonians, and not the other way around. 6 Magian, or Kabbalistic, teachings are clearly discernible among the Druids, who were particularly concerned with astronomy, or astrology, practiced vegetarianism, believed in reincarnation, and worshipped Dis, or Pluto, the god of the Underworld. Even after Patrick had converted the Irish to Christianity, the teachings of the Druids were never completely abandoned, but instead a unique culture developed, known as Celtic Christianity. Essentially, the arts of the Druids survived early Irish Christianity, as its abundant hagiography, steeped in magical ideas, plainly shows. Saint Columba, abbot and missionary traditionally credited with the main role in the conversion of Scotland to Christianity, after becoming a monk, lived and studied with a bard in Leinster, and later defended the cause of the Druids when their schools and teachings were attacked. 7 As well, in the fifth century AD, Fergus Mor, a direct descendant of Eochaid and Tamar, had migrated into Scotland from Ireland and established Dalriada in present Argyle.

The Stone of Destiny was then moved to Scone in Scotland due to the Norse invasions of Iona. Fergus’ grandson was Aidan Mac Gabhran of Argyll, King of the Scots, who lived from 574 to 608 AD, referred to by Geoffrey of Monmouth as the Uthir, meaning “terrible”, crowned King of Scots Dalriada, and Pendragon of the Celtic Isle, by his third cousin St. Columba, in 574 AD. 8 Uther Pendragon’s mother, Lluan of Brecknock, was supposedly a direct descendent of Joseph of Arimathea. 9 Uther Pendagran was the father of King Arthur. His mother was Ygerna del Acqs, the High Queen of the Celtic kingdoms. 10 Merlin was also an elder cousin to King Aedan. Merlin was a Celtic Druid and Vivien del Acqs, the grandmother of Arthur was the Queen of Avalon and High Priestess of the Ancient Celtic Religion. Constantine King Arthur was also related to the Constantine the Great, the Emperor who converted the Roman Empire to Christianity in 333 AD. King Arthur’s mother, Igraine, was descended from Dionotus II King of Britain, the great- grandson of Constantine. His wife Elen Lwyddog verch Eudaf, whose mother was descended from the Roman Emperor, Marcus Aurelius, who belonged to the Herodian line. 11 Caesar’s grandson, Gaius Calpernius Piso, had married Mariamne, the sister of Herod Agrippa. Their granddaughter, Pompeia, was the wife of Emperor Trajan, who was the grandfather of Marcus Aurelius. It was use of the dragon standard, or Draco, by these ancestors, Trajan and Marcus Aurelius, which according to Arrian, was of originally of Scythian origin, that came to be adopted by the Pendragon family. 12 As Emperor, Constantine was not only descended from Caesar, and Alexander the Great, but, according to British chroniclers of the Middle Ages, would also have been descended from Joseph of Arimathea, through his mother, Saint Helena, the finder of the “true cross”. Geoffrey of Monmouth made Saint Helena the daughter of Coel of Gloucester, and Strada “the Fair” of Combria. Her grandmother, therefore, would have been Gladys of Britain, who was descended from King Coel of Britain, whose mother was descended from Anna, the daughter of Joseph of Arimathea, and Beli Mawr, and also from Tamar Tephi, through the kings of Ireland. 13 King Coel’s father, Meric of the Britons Coel was the grandson of Emperor Claudius. 14 Constantine’s father was descended from Septimus Severus, who in 172 AD seems to have been appointed to the Roman Senate by Marcus Aurelius, before eventually becoming Emperor. Septimus married Julia Domna, the daughter of Julius Bassianus, who was the great-great-grandson of Gaius Julius Alexio, the Syrian priest-king Emesa, the son of Soaemus and Drusilla of Mauritania. 15 This Drusilla was the great-granddaughter of Marc"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 46 Antony and Cleopatrahad, who also been married to Felix Antonius. 16 Gaius Julius Alexio married Claudia, daughter of Arrius Calpurnius Piso, King of Syria, and Servilla, an illegitimate daughter of Roman Emperor Claudius, from whom the subsequent priests of Emesa were descended. 17 Included among these was the noted Neoplatonic philosopher, Iamblichus, who died in 325 BC. Iamblichus was the author of the most extensive surviving text pertaining to the Mysteries of Mithras, titled On the Cave of the Nymphs, in which he describes the symbolism of a grotto mentioned in Homer, in relation to the cave rituals of Mithraism. Iamblichus, a Syrian philosopher, who lived from 250 to 330 AD, sought to revive paganism by a return to its roots among the Babylonians and Egyptians, and the leading proponents of classical thought, like Pythagoras, Plato, Aristotle, and finally, in the mysteries. It was he, along with his teacher Porphyry, who wrote biographies of Pythagoras, recounting his sojourn among the Magi. Septimus Severus was the father of Caracalla, who succeeded him. But, in 217 AD, emperor Caracalla, was killed and Macrinus ascended to the imperial throne. His cousin, Julia Soaemias Bassiana, the daughter of Julia Domna’s sister, Julia Maesa, would not allow the usurper to stand unopposed. Together with her mother, Julia, she plotted to substitute Macrinus with her son, Marcus Aurelius Antonius, who appropriated the name Elagabalus, the name of the dying-god worshipped by the priest-kings of Emesa. In 218 AD, Macrinus was killed and Elagabalus became emperor. Elagabalus replaced Jupiter, head of the Roman pantheon, with a new god, Sol invictus, which in Latin means “the Sun, God Unconquered”. The cult of Sol Invictus was harmonized with the cult of Mithras, with which it was so similar that the two are often confused. Elagabalus forced leading members of Rome’s government to participate in religious rites celebrating Sol invictus, which he personally led. Their rule was not popular and soon discontent arose. Elagabalus developed a reputation among his contemporaries for eccentricity, decadence, and zealotry. With the emperor’s death in 222 AD, his religion ceased, though succeeding emperors continued to be portrayed on coinage with the radiant sun-crown, for close to a century. The emperor Aurelian introduced an official religion of Sol Invictus in 270 AD, making the sun-god the premier divinity of the empire, and wearing his rayed crown himself. The worship of Sol Invictus was continued by Constantine, who some think never converted to Christianity. Rather, when Constantine made Christianty the official religion of the Empire, he succeeded in fulfilling the Herodian plot of subverting the true Christian message, by instituting Paul’s version, known as Catholicism, which assimilated Jesus to the Gnostic figure of the dying-god."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"The Anglo-Saxons 47 The Saxons The Britons had supported their allies in Gaul during the Gallic Wars against the Roman Republic, prompting Julius Caesar to invade the island in 55 BC. The whole southern portion of the island became a prosperous region of the Roman Empire. It was finally abandoned by the Romans, early in the fifth century AD, when the weakening Empire pulled back its legions to defend borders on the Continent. Unaided by the Roman army, Roman Britannia could not long resist the tribes from the area of modern Germany, called the “Anglo-Saxons”, who arrived in the fifth century and sixth centuries AD. The Saxons were again descended from the Scythians. Strabo asserts that the most ancient Greek historians knew the Sacaea as a people who lived beyond the Caspian Sea. Ptolemy finds the Saxons in a race of Scythians, called Sakai, who came from Media. Pliny said: “The Sakai were among the most distinguished people of Scythia, who settled in Armenia, and were called Sacae-Sani.” Albinus, the learned tutor of Charlemagne, maintained that: “The Saxons were descended from the ancient Sacae of Asia.” 18 A tradition that the Saxons are descended from the Sacae has also been recorded by both the Camden and John Milton, the former in his Britannia, and the latter in his History of England. Camden writes: The origin and etymology of the Saxons, like those of other nations, have been involved in fable ... Each of these writers adopts the opinion most agreeable to them; I mean not to controvert any of them, but that of the most learned Germans seems most probable and worthy to be embraced, which makes the Saxons descended from the Sacae, the most considerable people of Asia, and to be so called quasi Sacasones, q.d. Sons of the Sacae, and to have gradually overspread Europe from Scythia or Sarmatia Asiatica, with the Getae, Suevi, Daci and others. 19 The Saxons, like the Vikings, claimed descent from a Hunnish leader named Uldin, later Odin, or Wotan. According to the Yngling Saga, written from historical sources available to the Icelander Snorri Sturluson, Odin came from the land of Asgaard, which was on the northwestern coast of the Black Sea, at the basin of the Don River: On the south side of the mountains which lie outside of all inhabited lands runs a river through Swithiod, which is properly called by the name of Tanais [Don River], but was formerly called Tanaquisl, or Vanaquisl, and which falls into the Black Sea. The country of the people on the Vanaquisl was called Vanaland, or Vanaheim; and the river separate the three parts of the world, of which the easternmost part is called Asia, and the westernmost Europe... The country east of the Tanaquisl in Asia was called Asaland, or Asaheim, and the chief city in that land was called Asgaard. In that city was a chief called Odin, and it was a great place for sacrifice. 20"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 48 Asgard is likely the same as Arsareth, to which the Lost Tribes, following the captivity, were to have been relocated.

And they entered in at the narrow passages of the river Euphrates, for the most High then showed them signs and stayed the springs of the flood till they were passed over; for through the country there was great journey, even of a year and a half, and the same region is called Arsareth. The Prose Eddas and the Heimskringla, also from Snorri Sturluson, recount that the ancestors of the Norse kings resided east of the river Don, and were led by Odin, or Uldin, who had vast holdings south of the Ural Mountains. He and his people were known as Ases, or Asir, and after many battles, he left two brothers in charge of his domains, along a ridge of the Caucasus Mountains, called Asgaard, likely Chasgar, and with his people headed north. 21 Most, however, were men, as apparently they took “women of the land” in Scandinavia as wives. This would have been approximately 450 AD, when Odin’s descendants were said to have founded the nations of the Danes, Swedes, and Norwegians, and in Germany, the Saxon tribes. Thor Heyerdahl had suggested the people noted by Snorri as the Ases, or Alans, or the Asir, may have been the Azerirs of Azerbaijan. 22 In turn, the Azeris are descended from the Medes, and genetic researcher David Faux has discovered that of all the groups anywhere, only the genetic samples from the Azeri contained haplotypes that were very similar to participants tested in the Shetlands, settled by “Vikings”. 23 Odin, though a real man, was eventually worshipped as a god by his ancestors. One-eyed, with a long white beard, he was a sorcerer who practiced divination from a severed head, and could change shape at will. Ancient scholars identified him with Mercury, known to the Greeks as Hermes, another species of dying-god that can be identified with Lucifer. Odin was married to Freya, the great-granddaughter of King Coel, whose grandfather, Aviragus, King of the Britons, married Genuissa, another daughter of Emperor Claudius. 98 L ike Astarte, Freya came to be worshipped as a goddess of fertility, love and war.

During the early Middle Ages, the Mithraic families intermarried with their brethren among the Saxons, and, most importantly, the descendants of Charlemagne, founder of the Holy Roman Empire. This combined lineage was again reconnected, during the Crusades, with the long- lost lineage of the Lost Tribes of Israel. These included the royal dynasty of Armenia, but also the branches of Eastern European aristocracies, of Poland, Bulgaria and Hungary, descended from the enigmatic Khazars of southern Russia. It was the reunion of these disparate dynasties that would incept in Europe the Illuminati’s diabolical plot to supplant Christianity. Their emergence was marked by the advent of the lore of the Holy Grail, and their feared symbol was the skull and crossbones. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, written in the ninth century AD, begins by saying that the Britons, like the Saxons, came from Armenia and the Picts of Scotland from the south of Scythia. The idea that the Scots came from Scythia is found in most legendary accounts and also in unedited versions of the Venerable Bede. 1 It was their counterparts, who chose to remain behind in the Don River Basin, who converted to Judaism in the eighth century AD, and who were known as Khazars. Therefore, these various peoples all descend from the Scythian tribes, who first appeared in Europe in the seventh century BC, when they crossed the Araxes River, the ancient name of the Aras River in Armenia, the area where the Israelites were last known before departing for Europe. In the article in the November 2001 issue of The American Journal of Human Genetics, Ariella Oppenheim, of the Hebrew University of Israel, wrote that her new study revealed that Jews have a closer genetic relationship to populations in the northern Mediterranean, including Kurds, Anatolian Turks, and Armenians, than to populations in the southern Mediterranean, like Arabs and Bedouins. 6 : The Ashkenazi"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 50 The Armenians traditionally identify themselves as descendants of Ashkenaz, the son of Magog. However, both Armenian and Georgian historians also record that after the destruction of the first Temple, Nebuchadnezzar transported numbers of Jewish captives, not only to Babylon, but also to Armenia and the Caucasus. By the end of the fourth century BC, some Armenian cities had large Jewish populations. 2 The medieval Armenian historian Moses of Khorene, wrote that King Tigranes II the Great, king of Armenia in the first century BC, settled thousands of Jews from Syria and Mesopotamia in Armenian cities. It appears that some of these earliest Jewish settlers later converted to Christianity. Josephus wrote that Judean Jews were taken by the Armenian king Artavazd II, and resettled in Armenia, again during the first century BC, but some years after Tigranes’ resettlement. 3 Researcher Kevin Alan Brook suggests that one possible avenue for the transmission of Armenians genes to Ashkenazi Jewry might be the aristocracy of the ancient kingdom of Adiabene, who converted to Judaism in the first century AD. According to Josephus, Monobazus: ...the king of Adiabene, who had also the name of Bazeus, fell in love with his sister, Helena, and took her to be his wife, and begat her with child. But as he was in bed with her one night, he lad his hand upon his wife’s belly, and fell asleep, and seemed to hear a voice, which bid him to take his hand off his wife’s belly, and not hurt the infant that was therein, which by God’s providence, would be safely born, and have a happy end. 4 The child’s name was Izates, and when he was older, a Jewish merchant named Ananias acquainted him with the religion of Judaism, with which he became deeply interested. His mother, Queen Helena, had been previously won over to Judaism without his knowing it. Upon ascending the throne, on the death of his father, Izates discovered the conversion of his mother, and he himself intended to convert to Judaism, and even to accept circumcision. He was, however, dissuaded from it by both his teacher Ananias, and by his mother, but was ultimately persuaded thereto by another Jew, Eleazar. Izates was succeeded by his brother, Monobazes II, who, according to Jewish tradition, as recorded in the Jewish Encyclopedia, was the son of Agrippa II and Helena. 5 Monobazes II himself had a son, named Izates II, who married Cleopatra, the granddaughter of Mark Antony and Cleopatra, and sister to Ptolemy King of Mauritania, who had been married to Drusilla, before she divorced him for Felix Antonius. 6 Their granddaughter, Awde of Osrhoene, married Mithridates Arshakuni, the son of Vologaeses I of Parthia, the great-grandson Antiochus I of Commagene, and from him were descended the kings of Armenia and Parthian and Sassanid Empires of Persia. 7 The grandson of Awde and Mithridates Arshakuni, Vologaeses V “Great King” of Parthia, married the daughter of Pharamenses III, who was a descendant of Alexander the Great, as well as Cleopatra and Mark Antony.

Manichaeism was founded by an individual named Mani, born near Baghdad in 214 AD, to a family related to the Persian royal house. According to the Fihrist of Ibn al-Nadim, Mani was brought up within the sect of the Elkasites, a Christian baptismal sect with Gnostic tendencies, resembling that of the Essenes, known as the Mughtasilah, that is, “those who wash”, or “baptize”, “themselves”. The Mughtasilah may have been related to the Mandaeans. The Mughtasilah, like the Mandaeans, wore white and performed baptisms. Mandaeans do not recognize Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad, but acknowledge instead John the Baptist, whom they revere as one of their greatest teachers. Scholars believe they originated in a Jewish-Gnostic group from Jordan, who emigrated to Babylonia in the first or second century AD, and among those still in Iraq, are Gnostic books preserved dating from seventh or eighth century AD. They dwelled in east Judea and northern Mesopotamia, from where the Mandaeans migrated to southern Mesopotamia, according to their legends. However, Mani protested against his upbringing, and around 240 AD, he began to propagate his own teachings, and became renowned for his spiritual healing and exorcisms. His followers proclaimed him “the new Jesus” and even credited him with a virgin birth. Mani regarded Zoroaster, Buddha, and Jesus as his forerunners and declared that he, like them, had received essentially the same enlightenment from the same source. His teachings were a fusion of Gnosticism, with aspects of Zoroastrian and Mithraic traditions, purporting that the creator god was evil. According to the Kephalaia, Mani spent many years in attendance of Shapur, the Emperor of the Sassanid Empire, and many years preaching in Persia, Parthia and Adiabene. 8 Shapur I was the second ruler of the Sassanian Empire of Persian, established by his father, Ardashir, which replaced the Parthians. Ardashir, the father of Shapur, was a descendant Antiochus I of Commagene. He married Ziyanak Arshakuni, a descendant of Monobazes of Adiabene, through her father, Artabanus IV Arshakuni, King of Media, the brother of Chosroes I “the Great” of Armenia. Under the leadership of Ardashir I, the Sassanids created an empire that was constantly changing in size as it reacted to Rome, to Byzantium to the west, and to the Kushans of Afghanistan to the east.

According to Alexander of Lycopolis, who wrote in the fourth century AD, Mani, as a member of court of Shapur I, accompanied him on his campaigns. 9 Mani made excursions into the Kushan Empire, in what is today Pakistan and northwestern India, when Shapur I extended his authority eastwards into the region, where the previously autonomous Kushans were obliged to accept his suzerainty. The Kushan Empire, which stretched from Tajikistan to the Caspian Sea to Afghanistan, and down into the Ganges river valley, became a stronghold of Mani’s religion, and a base for missionary expeditions into Central Asia. Manichaeism spread with rapidly throughout both the east and west. By 354 AD, Hilary of Poitiers wrote that the Manichaean faith had a significant following in southern France. Its most famous adherent was St. Augustine, who was a Manichean before his conversion to Christianity. The Manichaean faith was also widely persecuted. The faith maintained a sporadic and intermittent existence in west Mesopotamia, Africa, Spain, France, North Italy, the Balkans for a thousand years, and flourished for a time in the land of its birth, Persia. In 1000 AD, the Arab historian Al-Biruni wrote: “The majority of the Eastern Turks, the inhabitants of China and Tibet, and a number in India belong to the religion of Mani”. 10 When Shapur I died, sometime between 270 and 273 AD, and was succeeded by his son Hormizd, Mani received from him the same permission to teach that Shapur had granted him. But after only a year in power, Hormizd died, and was in turn succeeded by another of Shapur’s sons, Bahram. Soon after his accession, Bahram caused Mani to be crucified, had the corpse flayed, his skin stuffed, and hung up at the city gate. 11 The Paulicians Manicheanism was the source of an important Gnostic heresy in Armenia, called Paulicianism, whose eventual spread into Europe signaled the birth of the Illuminati conspiracy in that part of the world. This cult penetrated first into the Balkans, to influence the aristocratic families of Eastern Europe. These families derived their origin from the enigmatic Khazars, that Turkic peoples of southern Russia, descendants of the Scythians, who converted to Judaism in the eighth century AD. They were thus an important link in the transference of the inheritance of the so-called Lost Tribes, and the Armenian influence, to Western Europe. During the important era of the Crusades, it was their intermarriage with their counterparts among the Saxons, and another important faction of the Mithraic bloodline, whose primary representative was Charlemagne, that"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"The Ashkenazi 53 they transmitted Paulician influence to southern France. As Catharism, this creed would become the secret Gnostic doctrine of that family, identified collectively by the symbolism of the Holy Grail, or known as the Order of the Rose, and being the hidden power behind the vairous pernicious organizations, beginning with the Knights Templar, leading to the Rosicrucians, Freemasons, and finally the Illuminati. The earliest accounts of the introduction of Christianity into Armenia date from the first century AD, when it was first preached by two Apostles of Jesus, St. Bartholomew and St. Thaddeus. 12 The Armenian Apostolic Church, sometimes incorrectly called the Armenian Orthodox Church, has been around since the days of the apostles and therefore makes the claim of being one of the oldest denominations in Christianity. Armenia was the first country to adopt Christianity as its State religion, in 301 AD, when St. Gregory the Illuminator converted Tiridates III “the Great”, King of Armenia, the grandson of Tiridates II, and members of his court. According to a Manichean Sogdian text, a younger contemporary of Mani, brought Manichean beliefs to Armenia. 13 There, where there was already a significant Christian community, in the second half of the third century AD, Manichaeism influenced the formation of the sect of the Paulicians. The sect emerged under the dynasty of the Mamikonians, a noble family which dominated Armenia, between the fourth and eighth centuries, whose heraldic symbol was the double-headed eagle. The dynasty was incepted when Narses Souren I “the Great” Pahlav, a direct descendant of Tiridates II, married Sandoukht, the daughter of Vardan I. 14 According to Moses of Khorene, an Armenian historian of the fifth century AD, the tale of the Mamikonians’ origin begins with a rebellion of two Chinese brothers, who were princes, against the Chinese emperor in the early part of the third century AD. The brothers, Mamik and Konak, fought against the Chinese emperor but lost. They fled to the land of the Kushans, then under the influence of Manichaeism, and sought the refuge of the Persian king, which would have been Shapur. The Chinese emperor demanded the rebels be returned to China, or Persia would face war with the Chinese. The Persian king, not wanting to kill the brothers, but also wanting to avoid conflict with the Chinese, instead sent them west to Armenia, resulting in peace again between China and Persia. 15 The name “Paulicians” was derived from their respect for the Paul of Tarsus, whose Letters they honoured, in addition to the Gospel of Luke, though otherwise rejecting the Old Testament and the Letters of St. Peter. In the ninth century AD, Photius related that it was a certain Manichee woman, named Kallinike, who sent her two sons Paul and John to Armenia, to propagate this heresy. 15 The founder of the sect was Constantine-Silvanus, who hailed from Mananalis, a dualistic community near Samosata, the capitol of Cilicia. They Paulicians believed in a distinction between the God who made and governs the"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 54 material world, and the “God of heaven” who created souls, who alone should be worshipped, in other words, Lucifer. Therefore, like all Gnostic sects before them, they thought all matter to be corrupt. For the Paulicians, Christ was an angel sent into the world by their “God”. Jesus’ real mother was not the Virgin Mary, but the heavenly Jerusalem. This idea is derived from the Kabbalah, where the “Shekhina”, or “beloved” in the Song of Solomon, is equated with the “congregation of Israel”. Jesus’ work, they claimed, consisted only in his teaching that to believe in him saves men from judgment. Their enemies, therefore, accused them constantly of gross immorality, even at their prayer-meetings. The Khazars Adherents of the Paulician sect fled, with the Armenian Paul at their lead, to Episparis, in the Armenian district Phanaroea, the best part of Pontus, according to Strabo. 17 Pontus was a name applied, in ancient times, to the extensive region in the northeast of Asia Minor, now Turkey, the greater part of which lay within the immense region of Cappadocia, which in early ages extended from the borders of Cilicia to the Black Sea. But some of the Paulicians, it would seem, found their way to the land of the Khazars, who were then warring against the Arabs in the same region. The Khazars were sometimes credited with Armenian origin. This is stated by the seventh-century Armenian bishop and historian Sebeos, and the fourteenth century Arab geographer Dimashqi. 18 The Cambridge Document, discovered by Solomon Schechter in the late nineteenth century, and also known as the Schechter Letter, the Schechter Text, and the Letter of an Anonymous Khazar Jew, discusses how Jewish men fled either through or from Armenia into the Khazar kingdom in ancient times, escaping from “the yoke of the idol-worshippers”. This instance would refer to the persecution metted out in Armenia against the Paulicians. Like the Armenians, the Khazars were identified with Gog and Magog. They were regarded as descendants of Japheth, Noah’s third son, and connected with the Torgom-Togarmah and Ashkenaz of the Old Testament. 19 The “Ashkuza” of the Akkadians have also been linked to a branch of the Turks, and related to the Huns, called Oghuz, to which the Khazars belonged. 20 The Khazars were descendants of the Scythians, and the word “Ashkenaz” is thought to have originally applied to the Scythians (Ishkuz), who were called Ashkuza in Assyrian inscriptions. Lake Ascanius and the region Ascania in Anatolia derive their names from this group. 21 Therefore, it has been claimed that the Khazars derived from both the Edomites and the so-called “Lost Tribes”. Like their Edomite ancestors, the Khazars were also red-headed, and came to be known as “Red Jews”. As outlined by Raphael and Jennifer Patai, in The Myth of the Jewish Race:"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"The Ashkenazi 55 ...one should remember that the Khazars were described by several contemporary authors as having a pale complexion, blue eyes, and reddish hair. Red, as distinguished from blond, hair is found in a certain percentage of East European Jews, and this, as well as the more generalized light coloring, could be a heritage of the medieval Khazar infusion. 22 In particular, the Khazars were said to descend from the Tribe of Simeon, who had been assimilated into the Edomites. According to Eldad ha-Dani, a Jewish traveller of the ninth century, the Khazars were remnants of Simeon and Manasseh. The tribe of Zebulon, on the other hand, he explained, occupies the land extending from the province of Armenia to the River Euphrates. Likewise, one version of the Letter of King Joseph, also known as the Khazar Correspondence, reported that the Khazars had a tradition that they were descended from the Tribe of Simeon. The Cochin Scroll also maintains that the Khazars were descended from Simeon and Menasseh. According to the Schechter Letter, after the Jews from Armenia and Persia had eventually assimilated almost totally with the nomadic Khazars, a strong war-leader arose, named Bulan, who succeeded in having himself named ruler of the Khazars. Sabriel, who happened to be remotely descended from the early Jewish settlers, and his wife Serakh, convinced him to adopt Judaism, in which his people followed him. 23 Arthur Koestler, in The Thirteenth Tribe, popularized the theory that the majority of European Ashkenazi Jews are in fact not descended from the ancient inhabitants of Israel, but from Khazarian converts to Judaism. The term “Ashkenaz” describes a relatively compact area of Jewish settlement in northwestern Europe, including northeastern France and northern Germany, where Jewish settlement is documented dating back to at least the sixth century AD. The traditional explanation of East European Jewish origins was that most Ashkenazi Jews reached Poland and Russia from Germany, and Germany from France. Modern genetic studies, however, have proven Koestler’s theory incorrect. Studies of mitochondrial DNA have demonstrated that Ashkenazi Jewish communities in Europe were composed mostly through intermarriage of Jewish men with women of European descent. The reason is that Radhanites, Persian Jewish merchants, had migrated to Poland or Germany or France, since the fifth century AD, where they mostly married into those communities for hundreds of years. The Proceedings of the National Academy of Science report, appears to bear out that Ashkenazi Jews must have arrived in Eastern Europe, not from the west and southwest, but from the south and east, that is, via northern Italy and the Balkans, Asia Minor and the Greek Byzantine empire, the Volga kingdom of the Khazars, or a combination of all three. 24 The non-Israelite haplogroups found in Ashkenazi samples include Q, which is typically Central Asian, and R1a1, which is typically Eastern European. Q is considered by researcher Doron Behar to constitute a minor"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 56 founding lineage among Jewish populations. Approximately five to ten percent of Ashkenazi Jews today are in this haplogroup, which originated in Central Asia. It is an extremely rare haplogroup in both Europe and the Middle East, found only Scandinavia, and the few countries that Khazars were known to have migrated to, like Poland, Hungary and Lithuania. 25 It has also been found that about half of Ashkenazi Levites possess Eastern European non-Israelite haplotypes belonging to the R1a1 haplogroup, which is typically Eastern European. The Levites are particularly interesting because, among them, it is the Cohens, or Kohamin, for whom the office of priest has traditionally been reserved. Levitical status is generally determined by oral tradition, passed from father to son, with children being Levites if their father and grandfather was. Until the eighteenth century in Europe, many Cohens could accurately trace their lineage back to a verifiable Kohamin such as Ezra. Today, families may verify their priestly lineage via the tombstones of deceased ancestors, as the universal symbol of the hands arranged for the Priestly Blessing. This is the hand gesture porpularized as Spock’s Vulcan salute in Stark Trek. Some scholars maintain, however, that because of the destruction of Jerusalem’s temple and the unavailability of lineage records, there is now no way to establish who is a Levite reliably. Levites in Orthodox Judaism continue to have additional rights and obligations compared to lay people, although these responsibilities have diminished with the destruction of the Temple. Orthodox Judaism maintains a belief in and hope for a restoration of a Third Temple in Jerusalem, and Kohanim are regarded as retaining their original sanctity, and some elements of their original roles and responsibilities, and having a status of waiting in readiness for future service in a restored Temple. Some Orthodox Jews have founded schools to train priests and Levites in their respective roles. The R1a1 haplogroup is almost never found among Sephardic Levites, and may have been introduced into the Ashkenazi Levite lines by Slavs, or Khazars who converted to Judaism. 26 R1a1, rather, is found all over Armenia, Georgia, and Eastern Europe in general, including the Sorbs, the Poles, and many people of central Europe. It’s also found in Finland, and many R1a1 people went west to Scotland and Scandinavia. Interestingly, the R1a1 was introduced only 900-1000 years ago into only the Ashkenazi Levite male population. The irony, of course, is the R1a1 Kurgans who are the founders of this haplogroup are considered the epitome of Indo-Europeanism. The homeland of the Indo-Europeans is the steppes north of the Black Sea, right where the Khazarian Empire was located. But the problem is that not only were Khazars most likely significantly R1a in their ancestry, but most Eastern Europeans are also R1a. 27 The finding raises the question of how the signature became so widespread among the Levites. The foreign genetic signature found among Levites occurs on the male or Y chromosome and comes from a few men, or perhaps a single ancestor, who lived about 1,000 years ago, just as the Ashkenazim were beginning"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"The Ashkenazi 57 to be established in Europe. It has been proposed that the ancestor who introduced it into the Ashkenazi Levites could perhaps have been from the Khazars. Ultimately, it was through the infiltration of Armenian Jews that the double-headed eagle of the Mamikonians became their heraldic symbol the Khazars. The striking or rising eagle, Togrul or Togarmah, meaning “the powerful eagle”, represents for Khazars the messenger and mediator of Tängri, meaning “The Lord-God-The sun”. It also represents the sacred royal imperial power, in Hebrew Malchut Ha-Shmayim, since more than three thousand years, and is the heraldic symbol of the two merged royal clans, in Hebrew Ha-Shechina, and Turkic Ashina. Thus it is the very emblem of any Khagan, meaning “King of Kings, Emperor”, of Khazars. 28 The Magyars At its height, the Khazarian empire covered the area of the Ukraine, southern Russia to the Caucasus, and the western portions of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan to the Aral Sea. The town of Kiev, meaning “the site at the shore”, at the Dnepr river, had been founded by the Khazars around the beginning of the eighth century AD, as a trading and administrative center in the western part of the Khazarian empire. However, a mounted force Viking force, known as the Kievan Rus, lead by prince Svyatoslav, in a treacherous collaboration with Byzantium, succeeded in penetrating the Khazarian empire, and destroying their capital Itil in 967 AD. Svyatoslav was the great-grandson of Halfdan Frodason King of Denmark, in turn descended from Odin, and whose mother was Hilda of the Vandals. Hilda’s father was Hilderic of the Vandals, whose mother was Eudoxia of Rome, the great-great-granddaughter of Constantine. 29 The resulting dispersal of the Khazars penetrated into the nations of Poland, Bulgaria, and the Magyars of Hungary, who were vassals of the Khazars. At the end of the ninth century AD, the Khanagate of the Khazars had appointed a man named Arpad, to be the leader of the kingdom of Hungary, formed by seven Magyar and three Khazar tribes under his leadership. 30 And, as recounted in the Gesta Hungarorum, Latin for “The Deeds of the Hungarians”, a record of early Hungarian history, written by the unknown author around 1200 AD, the Magyars were Scythians, originally descended from Magog: Scythia, which is called Hungary upon the [river] Don, is quite a vast land. Its eastern border stretches from the northern region to the Black Sea. Behind it runs the Don river with its enormous marshlands, where there are enough martens not just to lavishly clothe the noblemen and the lower ranking people, but also the herdsmen, swineherdsmen, and shepherds. The land is rich in gold and silver, and its rivers offer pearls and semi-precious stones. Scythia’s eastern neighbours were the nations of Gog and Magog, who were cut off from the world by Alexander the Great. The dimensions of the Scythian land are extremely"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 58 large. The people inhabiting it are still customarily called Don-Hungarians; they have never been under the yoke of any ruler. The Scythians are, namely, an ancient nation which has power over the east. Scythia’s first king was Magog, son of Japheth, and the nation obtained its name “Magyar” from him. 31 The Gesta goes on to explain that, from Magog’s descendants, Attila the Hun, came from Scythia to Pannonia, in 451 AD, with an enormous army, driving out the Romans and conquering the land. In the year 819 AD, it continues, Ogyek, the commander of Scythia and also descendant of Magog, decided to marry a woman named Emesh. During her pregnancy, Emesh saw a supernatural vision, in the shape of a turul, which landed on her body and made her pregnant. The Turul, like the Turkic Toghrul of the Khazars, is a giant mythical eagle, a messenger of god in Hungarian mythology, who sits on top of the tree of life, along with the other spirits of unborn children in the form birds. Turul is often replaced by the sun in illustrations of the tree of life. 32 Since a dream in Hungarian is called álom, the boy was named Almos, and became the father of Arpad. According to an early Greek document, Arpad and the Magyar clan was Manichean in religion. 33 Arpad and his clan began a push westward, eventually settling in what is today Hungary, where a unified Magyar state was established by Arpad’s great-grandson Geza, in 971 AD. Although still a pagan, when he became ruler, an alliance was concluded between the Holy Roman Empire and Byzantium in 972 AD, forced Geza to convert to Christianity, to secure a lasting peace for Hungary. Although Geza was baptized in 985 AD, it is doubtful his conversion was sincere, for according to the Bishop of Merseburg, he continued to worship pagan gods. 34"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"59 The Franks During the Crusades, those members of Eastern European aristocracy descended from the remnants of the Khazars, in addition to the the ruling families of Armenia, reconnected to ignite an important network, by intermarrying with the descendants of the Merovingians. The Da Vinci Code of Dan Brown has recently popularized the legend of that the Merovingians, the most important of the Illuminati bloodlines, was derived originally from the union of Jesus and Mary Magdalene. The likelihood of this possibility is nil, as the core doctrines of this lineage are based on the Luciferian teachings of Gnosticism. Rather, the myth of the union of Jesus and Mary Magdalene was preserved to disguise a more occult secret about the origin of this bloodline. More importantly, the descendants of the Merovingians eventually intermarried with the family of Charlemagne, founder of the Holy Roman Empire, and supposedly, that of an Exilarch, or claimant to the Davidic throne, named Rabbi Makhir. It is from this lineage that all the leading lines of European aristocracy descend, a bloodline featured as the central secret of Grail lore. The Merovingians, again, came originally from Scythia, where they were known as the Sicambrians, taking their name from Cambra, a tribal queen of about 380 BC. Then, in the early fifth century AD, the invasion of the Huns provoked large-scale migrations of almost all European tribes. It was at this time that the Sicambrians, a tribe of the Germanic people collectively known as the Franks, crossed the Rhine and moved into Gaul, establishing themselves in what is now Belgium and northern France. The Merovingians are believed in occult circles to have originally been Jewish, and descended from the Tribe of Benjamin, who had entered Greece known as Cadmus and Danaaus. Certain important details of the history of the Merovingians are related in the Fredegar’ Chronicle, a facsimile of which is in the Biblioteque Nationale in Paris. Fredegar, who died in 660 AD, was a Burgundian scribe, and his Chronicle covered the period from the earliest days of the Hebrew patriarchs to the era of the Merovingian kings. Fredegar’s Prologue tells how the Sicambrian line of “Franks”, from whom 7 : The Merovingians"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 60 France acquired its name, were themselves first so called after their chief Francio, a descendant of Noah, who died in 11 BC. Prior to their Scythian days, Francio’s race originated in ancient Troy after which the French city of Troyes was named. The city of Paris, established by the sixth century Merovingians, likewise bears the name of Paris, the son of King Priam of Troy, whose liaison with Helen of Sparta sparked the Trojan War. The claim, asserted in The Da Vinci Code, is that Mary Magdalene had brought to southern France a child she bore to Jesus, and that her lineage was survived among the Merovingians. However, as explained by genealogical researcher David Hughes: This theory was popularized in 1982 by the occultic book “Holy Blood, Holy Grail” in which the author to sensationalize his work purposely misidentified Jesus of Nazareth with His cousin Jesus “of Gamala”, for the author surely would have known better from his research. The author by this misidentification could make the claim that Jesus of Nazareth married Mary Magdalene and sired children and had descendants who eventually became the ruling houses of medieval and modern Europe, which the author refers to as the “Jesus Dynasty” or “Jesus Bloodline”, however, these are the wife and children of Jesus “of Gamala”, the cousin of Jesus of Nazareth, who by all accounts was celibate. It is true that descendants of Jesus’ so-called “brothers” and “cousins”, the “Desposyni”, gave Europe some of its noble and royal houses, however, none descend from Jesus of Nazareth Himself but only from His relatives “according of the flesh”, and, ultimately descend from Israel’s Davidic Dynasty, which according to the Bible has a “divine right” to rule. 1 According to the genealogies compiled by James Allen Dow, and based largely on the work of David Hughes, a descendant of Mary Magdalene and this Jesus, Quintus Tarus, a prefect of Rome, married Argotta, heiress of the Franks, to father Merovech, King of the Franks. 2 The most famous of all Merovingian rulers, though, was Merovee’s grandson, Clovis I, who reigned between 481 and 511 AD. Gaul was the richest and largest area of the western empire, but the Frankish tribes had not succeeded in organizing a single state, until Clovis defeated the surviving Roman forces in 486 AD. During his reign and that of his sons, Frankish power was extended over nearly all of Gaul and far into Germany. The Frankish kingdom eventually became the strongest and most extensive of the new German states, and it was the only one that truly survived into later centuries, and from it were descended the modern states of both Germany and France. Charlemagne Clovis converted to Roman Christianity, and an accord was ratified between him and the Roman Church, followed by a great wave of conversion. Clovis"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"The Merovingians 61 was granted the title of New Constantine, presiding over a Holy Roman Empire. Clovis’ successors, however, did not retain his ruthlessness, and instead became mere figureheads, puppets of the Mayors of the Palace, in whose hands was the real power. On Clovis’ death, his son Dagobert, acceded to the kingdom of Austrasia, but was deposed by a conspiracy on the part of Pepin the Fat, the king’s mayor of the palace, which the Church of Rome approved, immediately passing the Merovingian administration of Austrasia to him. Pepin was followed by Charles Martel, one of the most heroic figures in French history, and who was the grandfather of Charlemagne, according whose name the dynasty came to be known in history as that of the Carolingians. The Carolingians were partly of Merovingian descent, but more importantly, they represented the union of the once divided lineage of the Mithraic bloodline. This lineage had survived in two branches. Julia, the heiress of the Edomite royal bloodline, was the daughter of Herod Phollio King of Chalcis, whose grandfather was Herod the Great, and whose mother was the daughter of Salome, married Tigranes King of Armenia, the son of Alexander of Judea. Their son Alexander married Iotape of Commagene, the daughter of Antiochus IV. From them was descended St. Arnulf, a Frankish noble who had great influence in the Merovingian kingdoms as Bishop of Metz, and who was later canonized as a saint, and who lived from 582 to 640 AD. 3 In St. Arnulf, this lineage was united with the other branch. That other branch was survived in the priest-pings of Emesa, descended from Claudia, the grand-daughter of the Emperor Claudius, which had also culminated in the person of the Neoplatonic philosopher Iamblichus. 4 Saint Arnulf was the grandfather of Peppin II, the father of Charles Martel. Charles Martel’s son, Peppin III, was the father of Charles the Great, known as Charlemagne. In 771, Charlemagne assumed the throne and took advantage of his brother’s death to unite the Carolingian territories. Charlemagne’s goal was to unite through conquest all the Germanic people into one kingdom. By 800 AD, the Frankish kingdom included all of modern France, Belgium, Holland, Switzerland, almost all of Germany and large areas of Italy and Spain. Charlemagne received substantial help from an alliance with the Pope, who wanted to cut the remaining ties with the Byzantine Empire. In this way, the domains of the Pope became an independent state in central Italy. In the same year, 800 AD, Charlemagne was crowned Emperor by the Pope, becoming the first emperor in the west, since the last Roman emperor was deposed in 476 AD, and thus inaugurating the Holy Roman Empire. Charlemagne’s dual role as Emperor, and King of the Franks, provides the historical link between the Frankish kingdoms and later Germany, as both France and Germany look unto Charlemagne as the founding figure of their respective countries."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 62 Guillaume of Gellone It is frequently claimed by genealogists that all of European aristocracy can claim descent from Charlemagne. Less well-known, though significant for occult lore, is that Charlemagne’s descendants were intricately intertwined with those of one Rabbi Makhir, a Jewish Exilarch from Baghdad, known as Rabbi Makhir, or Natronai, who became the father of Guillaume the Gellone. This was the important union, infusing European aristocracy with Davidic lineage, by which occult societies, and books like the Holy Blood Holy Grail, have claimed represented the secret of the Holy Grail. It is also the reason for which one of the stated aims of the Illuminati, like the enigmatic Priory of Zion, mentioned in The Da Vinci Code, is to reinstitute the descendants of Merovingians, as rulers of a New World Order. The origin of the office of Exilarch is not known, but the princely post was hereditary in a family that traced its descent from the royal House of David. It was recognized by the state and carried with it certain definite prerogatives, first under the Parthian Empire of the Persians. The office lasted to the sixth century AD, under different regimes, when there was no Exilarch for a century, until the position was restored under the Muslims. In the eigth century AD, an Exilarch, named Judah Zakkai, had as rival candidate Natronai ben Habibai, who, however, was defeated and sent “West” in banishment. Natronai was the great-grandson of Izdundad Princess of Persia, the daughter of Yazdagird III, ruler of the Sassanid Empire, and married Exilarch Bustenai ben Hanina, who lived from 590 to 670 AD. Coincidentally, according to Medieval Jewish legends, one Makhir, often confused with Natronai, apparently arrived in southern France by the invitation of Charlemagne, who is said to have sent an embassy, in which a Jew, Isaac, took part, to ask the “king of Babel” to send him a man of royal Jewish lineage. In response, the Caliph Harun al Rashid, dispatched Rabbi Makhir to him. According to the appendix of a fourteenth century work titled Sepher ha Kabbalah: Then King Charles sent to the King of Baghdad [Caliph] requesting that he dispatch one of his Jews of the seed of royalty of the House of David. He hearkened and sent him one from there, a magnate and sage, Rabbi Makhir by name. And [Charles] settled him in Narbonne, the capital city, and planted him there, and gave him a great possession there at the time he captured it from the Ishmaelites [Arabs]. And he [Makhir] took to wife a woman from among the magnates of the town; *...* and the King made him a nobleman and designed, out of love for [Makhir], good statutes for the benefit of all the Jews dwelling in the city, as is written and sealed in a Latin charter; and the seal of the King therein [bears] his name Carolus; and it is in their possession at the present time. The Prince Makhir became chieftain there. He and his descendants were close [inter-related] with the King and all his descendants."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"The Merovingians 63 The translation that of the mention that Makhir was “close to the king and all his descendants”, as meaning he was inter-related with French aristocracy, through intermarriage, was proposed by Arthur Zuckerman , in A Jewish Princedom in Feudal France, 768 900. There are numerous confusing genealogies provided as to the descent of this Makhir, or Natronai. According to the research of James Allen Dow, Natronai married one Rolinda of Aquitaine. Their sons were Makhir and Gilbert of Rouergue. Makhir married Alda, the daughter of Charles Martel. 5 According to Zuckerman, Makhir would have assumed the Christian name of Theodoric, or Thierry, and assumed the title of King of the Jews, and ruled over the independent state of Septimania in southern France, with the city of Narbonne as its capital. In the Mediaeval, romances Theirry is called Aymery, and he was the father of Guillaume de Gellone, about whom there were at least six major epic poems composed before the era of the crusades. The device of his shield was the Lion of Judah. At the height of his power, he included as part of his dominion, northeastern Spain, the Pyrenees, along with the region of Septimania. Zuckerman maintains the reference of Makhir’s descendants being “close” to those of the king should be understood to mean “inter-related”, or that Guillaume’s ancestors intermarried with those of the Carolingians. As late as 1143 AD, Peter the Venerable of Cluny, in an address to Louis VII of France, condemned the Jews of Narbonne who claimed to have a king residing among them, a claim based presumably on the legend of Makhir. In 1144 AD, Theobald, a Cambridge monk, spoke of “the chief Princes and Narbonne where the royal seed resides.” In 1165-66 AD, Benjamin of Tudela, the famous Jewish traveler and chronicler, reports that in Narbonne there are “sages, magnates and princes at the head of whom is... a remnant of the House of David as stated in his family tree.” 6 The Guilhemids And, again, though the lines we are about to trace are intricate, it is only through a careful study of them that we may discern that there was a central importance attributed to these bloodlines. This concurs with the claim that this bloodline contained a certain “potency”, purportedly derived from the fact that, not only, these families descend from the Line of David, but as we have seen, from the Mithraic bloodline, but, as well, a claimed descent from Lucifer himself. Because, as we will discover, this careful intermarrying constructed lines of descent to produce specific individuals who would play pivotal roles in this occult history we are following. A look at the numerous dynastic alliances between this Guillaume de Gellone, and the descendants of Charlemagne, will illustrate the degree of penetration of his lineage, and demonstrate the basis for his perceived"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 64 importance in occult circles. Their descendants, known as the Guilhemids, would form an important nexus, through intermarriage, with their Saxon and Scandinavian relations, as well as the aristocracy of Eastern Europe, descended from the Khazars, and the royal family of Armenia, that would figure centrally in the occult conspiracy that was brought to birth during the Crusades. Their subsequent subversive activities would alter the history of Europe, and provide an occult influence that would remain a hidden, though powerful influence, until they finally came to light as the Illuminati in the eighteenth century . Most historians consider the establishment of the Holy Roman Empire to actually begin with the split of the Frankish realm between the sons of Charlemagne’s son, Louis the Pious, at the Treaty of Verdun in 843 AD, who continued the Carolingian dynasty independently in three separate sections. The eastern part fell to Louis the German, while Charles “the Bald”, was granted Italy. Charles “the Bald” married Ermetrude d’Orleans, the granddaughter of Guillaume de Gellone. Their daughter was Judith of England, who married Baldwin I of Flanders, from whom descend the Counts of Flanders. Their granddaughter, Gunhilde d’Urgell, married Raymond II of Toulouse, who was descended from Bertha d’Autun, William of Gellone’s sister, and from them were descended the Counts of Toulouse. 7 The grandson of Raymond II Count of Toulouse, William Taillefer Count of Toulouse, married Emma of Provence, who was both descended from William of Gellone, and Priset of the Khazars. 8 Priset’s son, Barjik King of the Khazars, was the father of Irene, also known as Tzitzak. Irene married Constantine V “Copronymus” the Isaurian, a descendant of Antiochus I of Commagene, and became the father of Leo the Khazar, who became Byzantine Emperor in 775 AD. From Leo the Khazar was descended Michael III “the Drunkard” the Phrygian, and from him Charles Constantine. Charles Constantine was the father of Constance of Arles and Vienna, who married Boso of Provence, the great-grandson of Bernard Plantevelue, himself the grandson of Guillaume de Gellone. Their son was William Taillefer Count of Toulouse. 9 William Taillefer’s brother, Raymond III Count of Toulouse, married Adelaide of Anjou, daughter of Fulk II Count of Anjou. 10 Her brother, Geoffrey I Count of Anjou, married Adelais of Vermandois, who was descended from Pippin, brother of Louis the Pious, and son of Charlemagne, who married Cunigundis of the Franks, daughter of William of Gellone. Geoffrey of Anjou and Adelais’ daughter was Ermangarde of Anjou. Her daughter was Judith of Brittany, who married Richard II of Normandy. 11 Richard was the great-grandson of Rollo Ragnvaldsson, a Norman Viking leader, who married Poppa of Bavaria, the great-granddaughter of William of Gellone, and from whom were descended the Dukes of Normandy. Rollo’s daughter, Adele of Normandy, married William III Duke of Aquitaine, from whom are descended the Dukes of Aquitaine. 12"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"The Merovingians 65 William of Gellone’s sister Ida Redburga, married Egbert of Wessex, of the Anglo-Saxon invaders who displaced the Britons from England, and a direct descendant, according to the chronicles, of Odin. Egbert had been forced into exile at Charlemagne’s court by a rival Saxon to the throne, Offa, King of Mercia, and returned to England in 802 AD, where he eventually became King of Wessex, and later first king of England. 13 Their son, Ethelwulf King of the English, was the father of Alfred “the Great” King of England, who in turn became the father of Edward the Elder, King of England. Redburga was also the grandmother of Thyra Dannebod Queen of Denmark, who became the wife of the Viking King Gorm “the Old” of Denmark, and the mother of Harald Bluetooth Blataand King of Denmark. Harald’s son, Sven I of Denmark, embarked on a full-scale invasion of England, and was accepted as King of that country, following the flight to Normandy of king Ethelred the Unready in late 1013 AD. 14 When Sven was baptized, along with the rest of the royal family, he was given the name of Otto, in honor of Otto I the Great, who was crowned Holy Roman Emperor in 962 AD. 15 Otto was the son of Henry I “the Fowler”, Holy Roman Emperor, who in turn was the son of Otto “the Illustrious”. The mother of Otto “the Illustrious” was Oda Billung, the daughter of Billung I Count of Thuringia, a Saxon. Billung had married Alda of the Franks, the daughter of Charlemagne’s son Pippin, and Bertha of Toulouse, the daughter of William of Gellone. 16 Hedwige, the sister of Otto the Great, married Hugh the Great, son of Robert I of France and Beatrix of Vermandois, a direct descendant of William of Gellone. Their descendants would become the dynasty of Capetians, from whom would descend all the kings of France until the Second Republic established in 1848. Quarrels, however, ensued between Hugh the Great and Louis IV of France, who was the son of Charles the Simple, the grandson of Charles the Bald, and Princess Eadgifu, daughter of Edward the Elder, King of England. These were mended upon the ascension of Lothair I of France, the son of Louis IV and Gerberge, the daughter of Otto the Great. Lothair granted Hugh the Great the Duchy of Burgundy and of Aquitaine, expanding the Capetian dominions. The son of Otto the Great, Otto II, who succeeded him, married Theophano Princess of Byzantium. Their son was Otto III, who became Holy Roman Emperor in 996 AD. Otto III had given full support to the crowing of Hugh Capet, the son of Hugh the Great, as King of France in 987 AD, after the death of Louis V, the son of Lothair. Hugh de Capet was succeeded by his son Robert II King of France, by his wife Adele of Aquitaine, the granddaughter of Poppa of Bavaria and Rollo Ragnvaldsson. Robert II married Constance d’Arles, a descendant of both Guillame de Gellone, and the Khazars.

The grandfather of Henry II was Henry I, Duke of Bavaria, the brother of Otto the Great. His mother was Gisela of Burdungy, a niece of Otto the Great’s wife Adelheid. The father of Henry II’s wife, Cunigonde of Luxemburg, was descended from Charles the Bald, and Ermentrude d’Orleans, the granddaughter of Guillaume de Gellone. 18 Cunigonde’s mother was Hedwig of Lotharingia, the niece of Otto I the Great. After their deaths, both Henry II and his wife Cunigonde were eventually canonized by the Catholic Church. In 1027 AD, Henry II was succeeded as Holy Roman Emperor by Conrad II, the son of Henry of Speyer and Adelheid of Alsace, the sister of Saint Cunigonde. Henry of Speyer was the grandson of Otto the Great and Edith of Wessex, and his brother was Pope Gregory V. Gregory V was succeeded by Sylvester II, known as Gerbert d’Aurillac, who was tutor to both Otto II and Otto III. Gregory V, Otto’s cousin, appointed him Archbishop of Ravenna in 998, and the emperor elected him to succeed Gregory as pope in 999. Gerbert introduced Arab knowledge of Arithmetic and Astronomy and the Abacus to Europe. Gerbert was reputed to have studied Kabbalistic arts in Spain, and to have been a sorcerer in league with the devil. Gerbert was supposed to have built a bronze head, that would answer his questions. He was also reputed to have had a pact with a female demon called Meridiana, who had appeared after he had been rejected by his earthly love, and with whose help he managed to ascend to the papal throne. The Bogomils Finally, when these various bloodlines reconnected with their counterparts in the east, they became introduced to the Paulicianism, whose influence produced the heresy of the Cathars, that was adopted by the Guilhemids, and ultimately figuring in the lore of their secret bloodline, the Grail legends. There was one union in particular, which set off the beginning of this relationship, and from which would derive the most important line of descent, and which would later figure at the center of the various covert activities of the early predecessors of the Illuminati. That union was the one between Adiva, the daughter of Edward the Elder, King of England, and Boleslav I, the Duke of Bohemia, and the person produced was a daughter named Dubrawka. 19 At the end of the eighth century AD, Bohemia, like the neighbouring sates of Great Moravia and Hungary, fell to the invading Magyars, and Boleslav I, known as “the Cruel”, became the first king of an independent Bohemia, after he led a Czech force in alliance with Otto the Great, that was victorious over them in 955 AD.

According to the Letter of King Joseph, Hasdai ibn Shaprut, who was foreign minister to Abd al-Rahman, Sultan of Cordova, made first unsuccessful attempt to resort to the Byzantine embassy to transmit his letter to the king of the Khazars. But, the envoys of Boleslav I, who were then in Cordova, and among whom were two Jews, Saul and Joseph, suggested a different plan. They offered to send the letter to Jews living in Hungary, who, in their turn, would transmit it to Russia, and from there through Bulgaria, to its destination at Itl. As the envoys guaranteed the delivery of the message, Hasdai accepted the proposal. 20 Dubrawka, the daughter of Boleslav and Adiva, married Mieszko I King of Poland, a member of the Piast dynasty. Mieszko and Dubrawka’s daughter, Adelaide, married Geza Arpad. 21 Their daughter Hercegno married Gavril Radomir, the son of Samuil, Tsar of Bulgaria. 22 Samuil was one of four sons of Prince Nikola Kumet, Count of Bulgaria, who was descended from Kubrat the first King of Bulgaria, himself descended from Attila the Hun. 23 Another branch of the Turks, the Bulgars, during the seventh century AD, had come under domination of the Khazars, with whom they shared a language. The Khazars forced some of the Bulgars to move to the upper Volga River region where the independent state of Volga Bulgaria was founded, while other Bulgars fled to modern-day Bulgaria. Through Jewish influence, Nikola Kumet’s sons were all given Jewish names, which included David, Moses, and Aaron. Nikola married Rhipsime Bagratuni, the daughter of Ashot II Erkat, Shahanshah of Armenia. 24 Bagratuni was the name of the dynasty that succeed the Mamikonians as rulers of Armenia, in the ninth century AD, and claimed Jewish descent. Moses of Chorene, who wrote a History of Armenia at the request of Isaac Bagratuni, the middle of the fifth century AD, stated that King Hracheye joined Nebuchadnezzar in his first campaign against the Jews, and took part in the siege of Jerusalem. From among the captives he selected the distinguished Jewish chief Shambat, and brought him with his family to Armenia. Shambat was purportedly descended from Nedabiah, the son of Tamar of the Davidic Dynasty, the daughter of Johanan Prince of Judah. 25 It is from this Shambat the Bagratuni claim descent. 26 These Bulgarian Csars became defenders of Bogomilism, a Gnostic heresy that developed in Bulgaria, in the tenth century AD, from Manichaeism and Pauliciansism. In 970 AD, the Byzantine emperor John Tzimisces, himself of Armenian origin, transplanted as many as 200,000 Armenian Paulicians to Europe, and settled them in the Balkans, which then became the centre for the spread of their doctrines. Settled there as a kind of bulwark against the invading Bulgarians, but the Armenians, instead, converted them to their religion, eventually evolving into what is known as Bogomilism. 27 Signifying in Slavonic “friends of God”, their doctrine maintained that God had two sons, the elder Satanael, the younger Jesus.

Then, aided by the companions of his fall, he created the visible world, the image of the celestial, having like the other its Sun, Moon, and stars, and last he created man and the serpent which became his minister. Later Christ came to earth in order to show men the way to heaven, but His death was ineffectual, for even by descending into Hell he could not defeat the power of Satanael. The belief in the impotence of Christ and the need therefore to appease Satan, led to the doctrine that Satan should be worshipped. Nicetas Choniates, a Byzantine historian of the twelfth century, described the followers of this cult as Satanists because, “considering Satan powerful they worshipped him lest he might do them harm.” 28 In the first half of the tenth century, Bogomil teaching, led by the priest Bogomil, appeared in Macedonia. Within a short period of time Bogomilism had grown into a large-scale popular movement. The Byzantine Empire was unable to eradicate the heresy, and David, Moses, Aaron and Samuil, began a rebellion in 869 to defend Bogomilism against its enemies, resulting in breaking Macedonia away from the Bulgarian Empire, establishing the first Slavic-Macedonian state. After their considerable territorial conquests Samuil was proclaimed Emperor and was crowned by the Pope of Rome. 29"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"69 The Sabians During the early Middle Ages, a new power appeared on the scene, a threat that would ultimately contribute to the Crusades. The impetus behind this great expansion of the Arabs, that led to the collapse of the Persian Empire, and seizure of much of the territories of the former Roman Empire, was the religion of Islam, revealed to Mohammed in the seventh century AD. Essentially, Islam did not claim to be a new religion, but to be a reaffirmation of the timeless message sent to mankind since the beginning of time, including the prophets of the Bible, and Jesus. However, in time, Islam too was subverted through the same pernicious occult influences that were infecting Europe, from a community in Harran, in southeastern Turkey, known as the Sabians. It was through their influence that there emerged the most notorious of radical Islamic groups, known as the Assassins, who, through contact with the famous Knights Templars during the Crusades, would be resonsible for transmitting the occult tradition to the West. Resulting in first the lore of the Holy Grail, the legend of this contact would also form the basis of Scottish Rite Freemasonry. Finally, the theme would form the rational for the continued relationship between the Masons and their counterparts in the East, who would claim descent from the Assassins, known as the Muslim Brotherhood. These are the primary instigators of “Islamic” terrorism, or false flag operations on behalf of the Illuminati conspiracy . The Sabians were related to the Mughtasilah, of which Mani had originally been a member. By transmitting its ancient Gnostic and occult lore the Islamic world, the cult would contribute to the emergence of Ismailism, particularly that faction centered in Egypt, with which the occult organizations of the West would have a long lasting relationship, and which in the twentieth century, would produce Islamic terrorism. Scholars believe the Mandeans originated in a Jewish-Gnostic group from Jordan, who emigrated to Babylonia in the first or second century AD. The Sabians were related to the Mandaeans. In Mandeans of Iraq and Iran, E.S. Drower maintains that in the mass of material offered by Arab authors there is a good deal 8 : The Assassins"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 70 to indicate that the Sabians had points of common belief with the Mandeans, and that the Sabians merely chose to adopt the language of Neoplatonism in order to lend an air of scholarship and philosophy to their tenets. 1 Harran, originally known as Carrhae, was less than a hundred miles from Samosata, the capital of Commagene, and belonged to the Roman province of Osrhoene, which was originally governed by descendants of Izates’ daughter, who married Mannos VI King of Osrhoene. It was their daughter, Awda of Osrhoene, who married Mithridates Arshakuni, the great- great-grandson of Antiochus I of Commagene, from whom were descended the kings of Armenia and Parthian and Sassanid Empires of Persia. 2 Often, according to Medieval scholars, the term Armenia had included much of Anatolia, or otherwise referred to cities on the Syrian-Mesopotamian route, such as Harran, and Edessa, the capitol of Osrhoene. 3 The Sabians were an important school of translators of Greek works into Arabic, primarily those dealing with mathematical and astronomical works. Most importantly, the Sabians were concerned with the philosophies of Hermeticism and Neoplatonism, which they transmitted to the Arabs, who in turn were responsible for introducing these ideas to the West. Following the closing of the Academy, the last of the Neoplatonists moved east, seeking temporary refuge at the court of the Persian king, though, finding their situation inhospitable, they departed from Persia to an unknown destination, some say to Harran in northwestern Iraq. According to al-Biruni, a Muslim scholar of the eleventh century AD, the Sabians were originally remnants of Jews exiled at Babylon, where they had adopted the teachings of the Magi, or Zoroastrians. These, he believes, were the real Sabians. However, he indicates, the same name was applied to an occult community of the so-called Sabians of Harran: They derive their system from Agathodaemon, Hermes, Walis, Maba, Sawar. They believe that these men and other sages like them were prophets. This sect is much more known by the name of Sabians than the others, although they themselves did not adopt this name before 228 A. H. under Abbasid rule, solely for the purpose of being reckoned among those from whom the duties of Dhimmies (protected non-Muslim community) are accepted, and towards whom the laws of Dhimmy are observed. Before that time they were called heathens, idolaters, and Harranians.... 4 The Sabians, according to Chwolsohn, author of a monumental work, the Ssabier, retained a mixture of Babylonian and Hellenistic religion, superposed with a coating of Neoplatonism. 5 As Majid Fakhry has explained: Their religion, as well as the Hellenistic, Gnostic, and Hermetic influences under which they came, singularly qualified the Harranians to serve as a link in the transmission of Greek science to the Arabs and to provide the Abbasid court from the"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"The Assassins 71 beginning of the ninth century with its greatly prized class of court astrologers. 6 The Sabians professed to follow Hermes and Agathodaimon, identified with Seth and Enoch. Essentially, like other dualistic sects, the Sabians taught the possibility of salvation through gnosis, which is attained in bypassing evil Archons that obstruct the ascent of the soul through the heavenly spheres, to reunion with the supreme deity. That supreme deity, to the Sabians, was the primal cause of the universe, but had no contact with mankind and instead had placed the universe under the rule of the planets. Hence the Sabians worshipped the planets, or rather the demonic beings that were believed to govern them. They were said to sacrifice to the gods of the seven days of the week, whose names were partly Babylonian and partly Greek. They were also reputed to celebrate “mystery” rites addressed principally to Tammuz or to Shamal, lord of the Jinn, and, in which they were suspected of making use of human sacrifice. 7 They were reputed to sacrifice a child, whose flesh was boiled and made into cakes, which were then eaten by a certain class of worshippers. 8 The Sabians, acting as translators and astrologers, were responsible for the diffusion of mystical teachings to the Islamic world, and of contributing to the formation of a mystical version of that faith, known as Sufism. It is also accepted that a set of Sufi treatises, known as the Epistles of the Ikhwan al Saffa wa Kkhullan al Wafa, or of “The Brethren of Purity and Loyal Friends”, a philosophical and religious encyclopedia, which scholars regard as reflecting elements of Pythagorean, Neoplatonic, and the traditions of the Magi, were drawn up in the ninth century AD, under Sabian influence. It is generally agreed that the Epistles of the Ikhwan as Saffa were composed by leading proponents of the Ismaili sect. The Ismailis were a splinter group of the Shiah, a sect that resulted from a split in Islam, in the middle of the seventh century, over who was to be the rightful successor of Mohammed. The majority, known as Sunnis, adhered to the Khilafas, Abu Bakr, Omar and Osman, while the Shiah insisted on the successorship of Ali, the Prophet’s nephew. Through the influence of Sufism, the central institution of the Shiah, the Imam, the office occupied by their leaders, had acquired a mystical significance. This office of Imam was thought to have been passed on directly from Ali, to the sixth Imam, Jafar as Sadiq, and then on through to the twelfth Imam, who disappeared in 873 AD. The Shiah majority, following twelve Imams, were known as Twelvers. Some of Jafar’s followers, however, remained loyal to his son Ismail, and came to be known as Seveners, or Ismailis. The Ismailis While terrorism does not belong in Islam, it was a method of political action first devised by a sect of the Ismailis, known as the Assassins. However, it was"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 72 the Crusaders who first came into contact with the Assassins who imported their techiques to Europe, where they were later reintroduced to the Freemasons of Egypt, to produce Islamic terrorism. In particular, the Ismailis perfected a method of indoctrination that would be employed by the Illuminati throughout the subsequent centuries. Though they professed outwardly to represent Islam, the Ismailis were committed to Islam’s destruction. Therefore, they devised grades of initiation, wherein the leaders could adhere to heretical Gnostic beliefs, while restricting the lower levels to professing some degree of orthodoxy. This allowed them to appear to defend the faith, all the while working towards its destruction, thus recruiting the lower ranks into undermining the religion they falsely believed themselves to be representing. It was an alleged member of the Brethren of Purity, Abdullah ibn Maymun, a charismatic leader, who succeeded in capturing the leadership of the Ismaili movement in about 872 AD. Though the earliest Ismailis had not deviated from the central tenets of Islam, it was primarily through his influence that the movement became definitely subversive, and not just of Islam, but eventually of all religions. Ibn Maymun, who has been variously described as a Jew, as a follower of the Mesopotamian Gnostic heretic Bardasanes, and, most commonly, as a Zoroastrian dualist, was brought up on Gnosticism, but was well versed in all religions. For Ibn Maymun, Islam was merely a front. The purpose of the seven degrees of initiation of the sect known as the Batinis, which he created, was, according to Nesta Webster: ... to link together into one body the vanquished and the conquerors; to unite in the form of a vast secret society with many degrees of initiation free-thinkers – who regarded religion only as a curb for the people – and bigots of all sects; to make tools of believers in order to give power to sceptics; to induce conquerors to overturn the empires they had founded; to build up a party, numerous, compact, and disciplined, which in due time would give the throne, if not to himself, at least to his descendants, such was Abdullah ibn Maymun’s general aim – an extraordinary conception which he worked out with marvelous tact, incomparable skill, and a profound knowledge of the human heart. The means which he adopted were devised with diabolical cunning... It was... not among the Shi-ites that he sought his true supporters, but among the Ghebers, the Manicheans, the pagans of Harran, and the students of Greek philosophy; on the last alone could he rely, to them alone could he gradually unfold the final mystery, and reveal that Imams, religions, and morality were nothing but an imposture and an absurdity. The rest of mankind – the “assess,” as Abdullah called them – were incapable of understanding such doctrines. But to gain his end he by no means disdained their aid; on the contrary, he solicited it, but he took care to initiate devout and lowly souls only in the first grades of the sect.

He became the founder of the Qaramitah, which became active in Arabia, where a number of Arabs were enlisted into the society. He put forward to them arguments borrowed from Gnostic dualism, permitted them pillage, and taught them to abandon prayer, fasting and other precepts. As a result of these teachings, the Qaramitah rapidly became a band of brigands, pillaging and massacring all those who opposed them, and spreading terror throughout the surrounding districts. The Qaramitah succeeded in dominating Iraq, Yemen, and especially Bahrain, and in 920 AD, extended their ravages westwards. They took possession of the holy city of Mecca, in defense of which thirty thousand Muslims were killed. The majority of Ismailis believed the successorship of the Imam continued among the Fatimid dynasty, who has established their own caliph and moved their capital to Cairo in 973 AD. The founder of the Fatimid dynasty was Ubeidullah, known as the Mahdi, who claimed descent through a line of “hidden imams”, from Muhammad, son of Ismail, and through him, from Fatimah, daughter of the Prophet. He was accused of Jewish ancestry by his adversaries the Abbasids, the Sunni rulers of Baghdad, who declared him the son or grandson of Ahmed, son of Abdullah ibn Maymun, by a Jewess. After the establishment of their power in Egypt, the substance of the teaching of the Fatimids was not very different from the code of Abdullah Ibn Maymun, and his more violent initiate, Qarmat. In 988 AD, the Fatimids established the university of Al Azhar, the oldest university in the world, and the most prestigious educational institution in Islam, though now under the orthodox Sunnis. In 1004 AD, the Fatimids established the Dar ul Hikmat, or the “House of Wisdom”, as a wing of Al Azhar. Under the direction of this Grand Lodge of Cairo, the Fatimids continued the plan of Abdullah ibn Maymun’s secret society, with the addition of two more degrees, making nine in all. As he progressed through these degrees, at first, the initiate was persuaded that all his former teachers were wrong, and that he must place his confidence solely in the Imams of the Ismailis, as opposed to the twelve Imams of the Twelvers. Eventually, he was taught to disregard the laws of Islam, and taught the doctrines of dualism. Finally, in the ninth degree, the adept was taught that all religious teaching was allegorical, and that religious laws need be observed only to maintain order, while he who understands the truth may disregard all such constraints."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 74 The Assassins A fatal schism split the Ismailis over the succession to the Fatimid Caliph al- Mustansir, who died in 1094 AD. The Egyptian Ismailis recognized his son al Mustali, but the Ismailis of Iran and Syria held the claim for his older son, Nizar. The Nizari were led by Hasan Sabbah. Having initially converted to the Ismaili sect, and then declaring himself to be a devoted adherent of the Fatimid Caliphs, Hasan Sabbah journeyed to Cairo, where he was received by the Dar ul Hikmat. His actions having eventually embroiled him in disgrace, he fled to Aleppo. After enlisting recruits in a number of cities, he succeeded in obtaining the fortress of Alamut in Persia, on the Caspian Sea. There he completed the plans for his great society, the infamous Assassins, deriving their name from the Arabic hashishim, or “eaters of hashish,” referring to the marijuana they consumed for ritual purposes. At Alamut, Hasan and his followers established a castle, or the Eagle’s Nest, where Hassan Sabbah took the traditional title of Sheikh al Jabal, or “Old Man of the Mountain”. According to a legend reported by Marco Polo, the Old Man had made, “the biggest and most beautiful gardens imaginable. Every kind of wonderful fruit grew there. There were glorious houses and palaces decorated with gold and paintings of the most magnificent things in the world. Fresh water, wine, milk and honey flowed in streams. The loveliest girls versed in the arts of caressing and flattering men played every musical instrument, danced and sang better than any other women.” 9 The Old Man would make his dupes fall asleep, so that when they awoke, they would find themselves in the garden, which he persuaded them was the Paradise described by Mohammed. So assured of its existence, they were willing to risk their lives on any mission assigned to them. The Assassins waged an international war of terrorism against anyone that opposed them, but eventually turned on each other. The Old Man of the Mountain was murdered by his brother-in-law and his son Mohammed. Mohammed, in his turn, while aiming to take the life of his son Jalal ud-Din, was instead anticipated by him with poison, though his son was again avenged by poison, so that from Hassan the Illuminator, down to the last of his line of Grand Masters, all fell by the hands of their next-of-kin. Finally in 1250 AD, the conquering Mongols, lead by Mangu Khan, swept over Alamut and annihilated the Assassins . Nevertheless, Nizaris survived, though in two rival lines. The minor line died out by the eighteenth century, while the major line, led by an imam called Aga Khan, moved from Iran to India in 1840.

The importance of Scotland was that it was thought to be there that the sacred bloodline was thought to survive, characterized by their red hair. While also deriving from Scythia, during the Crusades, a particular bloodline was composed, by way of intermarriage with the Eastern aristocracy, again, through the important person of Dubrawka of Bohemia, to result in the sacred bloodline of the Stuarts and Sinclairs, The Sinclairs were a Norman family descended from Rollo the Viking, a Norman Viking leader, who married Poppa of Bavaria, the great- granddaughter of William of Gellone, and from whom were descended the Dukes of Normandy. Rollo the Viking was the son of Rangvald the Wise, Jarl of Orkney. Orkney consists of about two hundred small islands just north of Caithness in northern Scotland. The islands were invaded by Vikings in the ninth century AD, where they ruled as Jarls, and made the islands the headquarters for their raiding expeditions. Studies have discovered that the genetic component of the population of Orkney is characterized by a type not found in other British samples, but one in high frequency in Russia, Ukraine, Bohemia, and throughout Central Asia, and rare in East Asia and Western Europe. According a study, titled The Eurasian Heartland: A continental perspective on Y-chromosome diversity, conducted by the National Academy of Sciences, the distribution of this gene grouping is “...likely to represent traces of an ancient population migration originating in southern Russia/Ukraine”, where it is found at a high frequency. 1 In other words, this specific genetic type originated in Scythia. The infusion of the racial component of these new invaders into the peoples of Scotland resulted in a prevalence of the red hair which was characteristic of the Scythians. Scotland has the highest proportion of redheads of any country in the world, with around thirteen percent of the population having naturally red 9 : The Holy Grail"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 76 hair. A further forty percent of Scots carry the variant gene which results in red hair. Ireland, as well, has the second highest population of naturally redheaded people in the world, amounting to about ten percent of its inhabitants. 2 Ragnvald was the great-grandson of Halfdan the Old. According to Snorri, Halfdan the Old was the most famous of all kings. Halfdan performed a human sacrifice at the winter solstice, that he might live three hundred years. Instead, however, he received the answer that he would not live more than the normal span of a man’s life, but that for three hundred years all of his descendants would achieve great repute. Emma of Normandy, the daughter of Rollo’s great-grandson, Richard Duke of Normandy, married Ethelred the Unready, the son and successor of Edward the Elder. When England was invaded by Sven I of Denmark, Ethelred was forced to flee from England to Normandy, to seek shelter with his brother- in-law, Robert. Ethelred returned to England in only 1014 AD, after Sven died, but he himself also died only two years later. Ethelred the Unready was then succeeded by his son, Edmund II Ironside. However, Canute the Great, the son of Sven and Gunhilda, the daughter of Dubrawka and Mieszko I of Poland, enjoyed greater support from the English nobility. 3 Nevertheless, Ethelred and Canute, negotiated a peace, in which they agreed that upon either of their deaths, territories belonging to the deceased would be ceded to the living. When Edmund II died, Canute became King of England, Denmark and Norway. To associate his line with the overthrown English dynasty, and to insure himself against attack from Normandy, where Ethelred’s other son, Edward the Confessor, and Alfred Atheling, remained in Exile, Canute married Ethelred’s widow, Emma of Normandy. He then designated their son Harthacanute as heir to the throne, in preference to his other son, Harold Harefoot, an illegitimate child by Aelgifu of Northampton, a concubine. In opposition to his brother, Harold proclaimed himself King of England in 1037 AD, after the death of his father, and had Alfred Atheling blinded and killed when they attempted to return to England. Harold himself died in 1040 AD, and Harthacanute, who was just then preparing an invasion, succeeded him to the throne. Harthacanute then invited his half-brother Edward the Confessor back from Normandy, to become his co-ruler and heir. Edward the Confessor then heard that another half-brother, Edward the Exile, the son of Ethelred the Unready by another woman, was still alive, he had him recalled to England and made him his Heir. When only a few months old, Canute the Great had sent Edmund’s son, Edward the “Exile” to be murdered in Denmark. Instead, however, he was secretely brought to Kiev, and then made his way to Hungary. In Hungary, Edward the Exile married Agatha of Bulgaria, the daughter of Gavril Radomir, son of Samuil of Bulgaria. Agatha’s mother was Hercegno of Hungary, daughter of Geza and Adelaide, daughter of Mieszko I and Dubrawka. 4 "},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"The Holy Grail 77 However, Edward the Exile died shortly after his return, so Edward made his great nephew Edgar Atheling his heir. But Edgar had no secure following among the nobles. The resulting succession crisis opened the way for the successful invasion by William the Conqueror, Duke of Normandy, the son of Robert of Normandy. Though Edgar Atheling was elected king after Harold’s death, he was brushed aside by William of Normandy, who would use his relationship, as grandnephew of Ethelred the Unready, as the basis of his claim to the throne, claiming that the childless Edward the Confessor had chosen him his heir. William further strengthened his claim by marrying, in 1053 AD, Matilda of Flanders. Matilda was descended from Baldwin II of Flanders, of the Guilhemids, who had married Ethelswith, the daughter of Alfred the Great. Baldwin II was the son of Judith of England, the daughter of Charles the Bald and Ermentrude of Orleans, herself the daughter of William of Gellone. 5 She was first married to Ethelwulf before she married Baldwin’s II father, Baldwin I Count of Flanders. Baldwin II’s grandson, Baldwin III Count of Flanders, was married to Matilda of Billung, whose father, Herman Billung, was the brother to Oda Billung, mother of Otto “the Illustrious”, Holy Roman Emperor. Matilda’s grandfather, Baldwin IV Count of Flanders, married Otgive of Luxembourg, daughter of Frederick of Luxembourg, brother of Saint Cunigunde. Camelot This marriage effected in Hungary came at a point when the numerous strains of this dispersed bloodline were reconnected, just in time for the Crusades, which brought into existence a number of organizations that incepted the occult conspiracy in Europe. The daughter of Edward the Exile and Agatha of Bulgaria was St. Margaret Queen of Scotland. 6 Thus, when she married Malcolm III of Scotland, who was descended from Aidan, the father of King Arthur, the joint Saxon and Khazar heritage was joined to the Scottish. Malcolm and Margaret’s son became David I of Scotland, while David’s sister, Editha, married Henry I King of England, the son of William the Conqueror. It was their descendants, the Stuarts and Sinclairs, the purported Grail family, who would figure centrally in coming developments. One influencing factor in the rise of Arthurian legend among the Normans was that William the Conqueror was also a descendant of the Bretons, who had also supported William the Conqueror at the Battle of Hastings, providing a large proportion of the knights. The Bretons had kept alive the legends of King Arthur, brought with them when they fled Britain during the Saxon invasions five centuries earlier. The reason being, as the authors of the Holy Blood Holy Grail have shown, might have been that, in contrast to later Grail chroniclers, Wolfram von Eschenbach, instead locating of Arthur in Britain, maintained"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 78 that his court of Camelot was situated in France, quite specifically at Nantes in Brittany. According to Wolfram, then, Arthur’s court is in Brittany. Originally settled by Celtic tribes, Brittany was conquered by Julius Caesar in 56 BC. Christianised in the third century, Brittany was successively invaded by the Saxons, in the third century. In the fourth century, Romanized Britons from across the English Channel started to settle, and at an increasing rate as Roman troops began their withdrawal from Britain, having been pushed by the raiding Anglo-Saxons. The immigrant Britons gave the region its current name and contributed to the Breton language, a sister language to Welsh language and Cornish. During the ninth century AD, Brittany was severely affected by Viking attacks, contributing to the nobility being fraught by dynastic disputes. The authority of the reigning dukes suffered even further from the pressures of resisting claims by both the dukes of Normandy and the counts of Anjou. This process of fragmentation was halted and reversed from the eleventh century, when intermarriage resulted in the ducal title vesting in one individual, Duke Alain IV, and scion of a direct line of descent of kings of Brittany, and before that, of Britain, descended from Llyr the Celtic Sea god, the father of Bran the Arch Druid, who married Anna, the daughter of Joseph of Arimathea. Bran and Anna had twelve sons, and it was Alain le Gros, their youngest son, who became known as the Fisher King, and Keeper of the Grail. 7 Alain IV Duke of Brittany married Ermengarde of Anjou, the daughter of Fulk IV. The counts of Anjou were descended from Ingelger, Count of Anjou, who was knighted by Louis, son of Charles the Bald, as the first lord of Anjou. Ingelger was the father of Fulk I of Anjou, whose grandson, Geoffroi I comte d’Anjou married Adelaide of Vermandois. The House of Vermandois were Guilhemids, descended from from Guillaume’s daughter Cunigonde and Bernard of Italy, grandson of Charlemagne. Their son was Fulk III Count of Anjou, whose daughter, another Ermingarde, was the mother of Fulk I. Ermengard had previously been married to William IX Duke of Aquitaine, who lived from 1071 to 1112 AD. He was direct descendant of Guillaume de Gellone. His granddaughter was Eleanore of Aquitaine. Eleanor’s father was William X of Aquataine, and her mother, Philippa of Toulouse. Eleanor inherited the Duchy of Aquitaine, and, marrying Louis VI, the grandson of Philip I, became queen of France. However, Eleanor’s conduct aroused Louis’s jealousy and marked the beginning of their estrangement. Their marriage was finally annulled in 1152 AD. Eleanor then married Henry II King of England. Fulk IV’s son, Fulk V was the father of Geoffrey V Plantagenet, through whom were united the Guilhemid, Norman, Saxon and Khazzarian lines, when he married Matilda, the daughter of Henry I of England, and Editaha of Scotland. Their son was Henry II, who became King of England in 1154 AD, and married Eleanore of Aquitaine, the granddaughter of William IX of Aquitaine."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"The Holy Grail 79 Thus, Henry II ranks as the first of the Plantagenet kings of England, and through his marriage to Eleanor, established the Angevin Empire, as it is called, that controlled a domain dwarfing the power of France, and incorporating all of England, half of France, as well as Scotland and Ireland. Eleanore bore him five sons and three daughters, one of whom was Richard I, “the Lion- Hearted”, who succeeded his father as king of England, and under whom the Angevin Empire attained its height. The Cathars Somehow, perhaps through these intermarriages, Paulician and Bogomil influences ended up in in southern France, among the Guilhemids, where they produced the heresy of the Cathars. Though, this heresy also received influences from the Kabbalah, which was then flourishing in the region. It was Eleanor’s grandfather, William IX of Aquitaine, who is recognized as the first of the troubadours, part of a culture of “Courtly Love” that developed out of the influence of Catharism, which flourished in the Languedoc, particularly the regions of Toulouse and Aquitaine. Essentially, the Cathars were Gnostic. The New Testament they attributed to the benevolent God, but that the God of the Old was evil, equating him with Satan. They believed also that the Christ who was born in the visible, and terrestrial Bethlehem, and crucified in Jerusalem, was an evil man, and that Mary Magdalene was his concubine. For the good Christ, as they claimed, never ate, nor drank, and never assumed physical form, except spiritually in the body of Paul. They also regarded the Church of Rome was a “den of thieves”, and as the harlot of the Apocalypse. 8 The Cathars also practiced vegetarianism and believed in a form of reincarnation. Marriage was frowned upon, and they believed that those who bore children could not be saved in this world. It was as a result of this particular belief that the term “buggery” was introduced, since if they were to give in to sexual temptation in this manner, it would at least ensure that no children resulted. And, like the Gnostics before them, the Cathars were accused of engaging in sexual orgies, sometimes involving incest, and of practicing secret rituals in worship of the Devil, involving the sacrifice of children and eating their flesh in cannibalistic rites. The Crusades Gershom Scholem, the foremost scholar of the subject, acknowledged that Catharism was influenced by a Kabbalistic text known as the Sepher ha- Bahir. The origin of the work is unknown. Though there had been important"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 80 mystical developments leading up to that time, the teachings of the Rabbis of the Languedoc region underwent a powerful transformation, due to the infusion of a new mystical tradition, which the Bahir exemplified. Scholars of the Kabbalah have been unable to account for the source of this tradition, however, because it represented a form of classical Gnosticism of a kind that had disappeared since the first centuries AD. One possible avenue for the transmission of the Gnostic knowledge of the Sepher ha-Bahir, corroborated by rumours familiar in the occult, is that the infamous Knights Templar had undertaken excavations beneath the Temple of Solomon in Jerusalem. Therefore, because of the special associations that persisted between the Templars and the Cathars, as well as the leading families of the Languedoc region, it would appear that the Crusades were instigated deliberately to provide the Templars this very opportunity, because it was likely known among them that such texts, or other treasures, still remained buried beneath the Temple. In March of 1095, ambassadors sent by Byzantine emperor Alexius I called for help in defending his empire against the Seljuk Turks. Later that year, at the Council of Clermont, Pope Urban II called upon all Christians to join a war against the Turks, promising those who died in the endeavor immediate remission of their sins. The first to respond, a ragtag band led by Peter the Hermit, were known collectively as the People’s Crusade. However, lacking in military discipline, and ill-equipped, they were massacred by the Seljuk Turks. The venture that did succeed was the one led by the leading representatives of the Guilhemids, known as the Princes’ Crusade. The son of Alexius I Comnenus, John II Comnenus, married Piroska of Hungary. She was the daughter of King Ladislau I of Hungary, the great-grandson of Michael, brother of Geza, and Adelaide, the daughter of Mieszko I King of Poland. John II’s son, Manuel I Comnenus, married Maria, the daughter of Raymond of Antioch, the son of William IX “the Troubadour” of Aquitaine, and Mahaut Countess of Toulouse. The father of Mahaut, William IV of Toulouse, was the brother of Raymond IV, leader of the First Crusade. His mother, Constance, Princess of Antioch, was the daughter of Bohemund II, the grandson of Robert Guiscard, and Alix Princess of Jerusalem, whose father, Baldwin II King of Jerusalem, shared a grandfather with Godfroi de Bouillon, Manasses III. Raymond’s mother, Almodie de la Marche, was a descendant of Gilbert de Rouergue, the brother of Rabbi Makhir. His son Fredelon married Bertha of Autun, the sister of William of Gellone. Their grandson son was Raymond I of Toulouse. 9 Raymond was joined by Bohemond, the son of Robert Guiscard, who was married to Constance of France, the daughter of Philip I King of France. Philip I’s father was Henry I King of France. Henri married Anne of Kiev, the daughter of Yaroslav I the Wise, one of numerous sons of Vladimir Grand Duke of Kiev. Yaroslav’s mother was the famous Rogneda of Polotsk. It has been speculated that her father Ragnvald, who came from Scandinavia, and"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"The Holy Grail 81 established himself at Polatsk in the mid-10th century, belonged to the Ynglings royal family of Norway. In or about 980, Vladimir of Novgorod, on learning that Rogneda was betrothed to his brother Yaropolk I of Kiev, took Polotsk and forced Rogneda to marry him. Having raped Rogneda in the presence of her parents, he ordered them to be killed, along with two of Rogneda’s brothers. Rogneda gave him several children, among which was Yaroslav. 10 Most importantly, Raymond and Bohemund were aided by Godfroi of Bouillon, duke of Lorraine. Godfroi’s father, Eustace II, was descended Baldwin I of Flanders, Alfred the Great, and from Siegried, the father of Cunigunde of Luxemburg, whose wife was Hedwig of Nordgau, was the granddaughter of Henry the Fowler. Siegfried’s mother was Cunigunde of Hainaut, the great- granddaughter of Charles the Bald. Godfroi’s mother was Ida of Verdun, who was descended on her father’s side from Hugh the Great, and Friedrich of Upper and Lower Lorraine, the brother of Siegried of Moselgau. Ida’s mother is descended from Hedwig’s sister, Albrada of Lorraine. When the Princes’ Crusade succeed in capturing Jerusalem, in 1099 AD, Godfroi was offered the crown as “King of Jerusalem”. He refused, and it was instead accepted by his brother, Baldwin. The Templars Then, in 1118 AD, the order of the Templars was founded in the conquered city. The Templars, one of two of the principal order of crusading knight, along with the Knights Hospitallers of St. John, are well recognized as the typical image of the crusaders, with long white mantles, emblazoned with the equal armed red cross “pattee.” Originally concerned with ensuring safe passage of Christian pilgrims between the port of Jaffa and the city of Jerusalem, the order was founded by a French nobleman, Hughes de Payens, and eight other soldiers, who took the name, Poor Knights of the Temple, from Temple of Solomon, from where they were first stationed. The legend recounted in occult circles is that the Templars learned from certain “initiates of the East”, a Jewish doctrine which was attributed to St. John the Apostle. 11 These Christians of St. John, known as Johannites, and reputed to inhabit the “banks of the Euphrates”, are identified with the Mandeans or the Sabians. The Templars were also reputed to have acquired such teachings from the Assassins. The Hermeticism of the Sabians, also preserved by the Ismailis of the Grand Lodge in Cairo, was thought to represent the preserved Gnostic teachings of Hellenistic Alexandria. Because the Mandeans revered John the Baptist as the prophet of the ancient religion of Moses, Kurt Rudolph, noted scholar of Gnosticism, has pointed out, “the attempt has been made to deduce from this that we have here historical traditions of the disciples of the Baptist, but this cannot be proved up to now. It"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 82 is more likely that the Mandeans took over legends of this kind from heretical Christians, possible Gnostics, circles and shaped them according to their ideas.” 12 The “Johannite” doctrine, derived originally from Talmudic or Kabbalistic sources, taught that Jesus was the illegitimate son of Mary, who as a boy, was taken to Egypt, where he was initiated into the secret doctrines of the priests of the Essenes, and returned to Palestine to deceive the people with his magic. 13 According to Kabbalistic legend, it had also been in Egypt that Moses was initiated, where he learned the highest mysteries, which he then passed on to his brother Aaron and to the leaders of the Israelites. Jesus, therefore, was then supposedly instructed in these traditions, at a school in Alexandria, in the degrees of Egyptian initiation, giving rise to the legend that he had belonged to the Essenes, by which he initiated or baptized his disciples in the manner of St. John. It was from the Mandeans that the Templars appropriated the teaching that Jesus was a false Messiah sent by the devil, for they had, as occultist Eliphas Levi described, “two doctrines; one was concealed and reserved to the leaders, being that of Johannism; the other was public, being Roman Catholic doctrine.” 14 Therefore, contact with the Sabians or Assassins was one possible avenue for the transmission of the Gnostic knowledge that went to form the content of the Bahir. Nathaniel Deutsch, in The Gnostic Imagination: Gnosticism, Mandaeism and Merkabah Mysticism, recognizes that: At present, we must be satisfied with acknowledging the phenomenological parallels between the Mandaean and Kabbalistic traditions, although we must also seriously consider the possibility that both Mandaean and Kabbalistic sources drew on a common pool of earlier (Jewish?) theosophic traditions. 15 The other possibility is that the Bahir was derived from text discovered hidden beneath the Temple by the Templars. In fact, the Templars had long been rumored to have discovered a “treasure”, while stationed in Jerusalem, that made them phenomenally wealthy and powerful. And, in 1867, Captain Wilson, Lieutenant Warren and a team of Royal Engineers found strong support for these rumours. They had re-excavated the area and uncovered tunnels extending vertically, for some 25 meters, before fanning out under the Dome of the Rock, which is generally thought to be the site of King Solomon’s temple. Crusader artifacts found in these tunnels attest to Templar involvement. More recently, a team of Israeli archaeologists, intrigued by the Warren and Wilson discovery, reinvestigated the passage and concluded that the Templars did in fact excavate beneath the Temple. 16 The Templars may have discovered texts that had been hidden beneath the site prior to its destruction by the Roman invasion in 70 AD, thus accounting for the mysterious appearance of the Bahir, as it was described by the Kabbalists as having reached them from Palestine, “in extremely mutilated form, as remnants of scrolls, booklets and traditions.” 17 Once in southern France, this new mystical approach touched off not only a revolution in Jewish thinking,"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"The Holy Grail 83 producing what is now known as the Medieval Kabbalah, but contributed to the Christian heresy of the Cathars, and from them the Templars. The influence of the Bahir, through the Cathar culture of Courtly Love entirely transformed the legend of King Arthur, known as the Matter of Britain, makes its appearance in French literature, in the years following the Templar discovery. The Templars then became the focus of the various Arthurian romances, which gained popularity in the twelfth century. Arthur was said to hold court at Camelot, and to have gathered the Knights of the Round Table, including Lancelot, Gawain, Galahad, and others, who were descendants of the Fisher Kings. These knights engaged in fabulous quests, most importantly, the quest for the “Holy Grail”. The Grail legends therefore refer cryptically to the Templar project in the Holy Land. The Templars were the agents of the Guilhemids. And, it was among the Jews of Narbonne that the Kabbalah underwent this transformation. Narbonne had been the capital of Septimania, where Rabbi Makhir had originally been appointed “King of the Jews”, and taken the name of Thierry, and which continued to be governed by his descendants, the Guilhemids. Scholem also concludes, “whatever we know about the earliest Kabbalists and As Scholem has pointed out, the Cathars agree with the Kabbalists on a number of points, but that, “the question of a possible link between the crystallization of the Kabbalah, as we find it in the redaction of the Bahir, and the Cathar movement must also remain unresolved, at least for the moment. This connection is not demonstrable, but the possibility cannot be excluded.” 18 Several thirteenth century Christian polemicists had reproached the Cathars for their relations with Jews, and historian Paul Johnson notes that, “the Church was by no means wide of the mark when it identified Jewish influences in the Cathar movement...” 19 In Jewish Influences on Christian Reform Movements, Louis I. Newman concludes: ... that the powerful Jewish culture in Languedoc, which had acquired sufficient strength to assume an aggressive, propagandist policy, created a milieu wherefrom movements of religious independence arose readily and spontaneously. Contact and association between Christian princes and their Jewish officials and friends stimulated the state of mind which facilitated the banishment of orthodoxy, the clearing away of the debris of Catholic theology. Unwilling to receive Jewish thought, the princes and laity turned towards Catharism, then being preached in their domains. 20 Ultimately, the secret of the Holy Grail, as the authors of the Holy Blood Holy Grail revealed, is that of a sacred lineage. Therefore, the authors concluded, the Sangreal should be translated to mean, “Sang Real” or Royal Blood”. The authors, like Dan Brown after him, erred in asserting descent from Jesus and Mary Magdalene. Grail lore, like that of the Cathars, is Gnostic. Rather, Mary Magdalene is an esoteric symbol, referring to the goddess, and"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 84 the royal blood of the Grail is a Lucifarian bloodline, which stems from the unholy conspiracy against the life of Jesus. According to a anonymous Grail legend by the name of the Perlesvaus, we find: “here is the story of thy descent; here begins the Book of the Sangreal.” Theodoric was known as Aymery in the romances, and was the father of Guillaume de Gellone, about whom there were at least six major epic poems composed before the era of the crusades, including Willehalm, by Wolfram. In a Wolfram poem, Perceval is the father of Lohengrin, the Knight Swan. One day, in his castle Munsalvaesche, he hears a bell toll as a signal to come to the aid of a damsel in distress. According to some sources, she was the duchess of Bouillon, whom Lohengrin hastened to her rescue in a boat drawn by swans. Having defeated her persecutor, he married the lady, though, requiring of her that she not question about his ancestry. At last, wrought with curiosity, she broke the vow, at which point Lohengrin was forced to leave. Though, he left her with a child, according to various accounts, that was either father or grandfather of Godfroi de Bouillon. Baphomet To deal with the Cathar heresy, at first, the Church tried conversion, by sending a number of legates into the region of Toulouse. But the local nobles protected the Cathars, and the Bishops of the district rejected the authority of the Pope’s legates. Papal legate Peter of Castelnau, known for excommunicating the noblemen who protected the Cathars, excommunicated Raymond VI, the Count of Toulouse. Raymond VI was the great-grandson of Raymond I, who led the First Crusade. Raymond I’s wife was Elvira of Castile and Leon, the daughter of Zaida of Denia, an Ismaili of the Fatimids, who had married Alfonso VI “the Brave” of Leon. 21 Elvira had first married Roger II Guiscard. Raymond VI’s mother was Constance Capet of Toulouse, the great-great-granddaughter of Constance of Arles and Vienna. 22 Raymond VI was himself married to Joan Plantagenet, daughter of Eleanor of Aquitaine and Henry II King of England. Peter of Castelnau was then murdered near Saint Gilles Abbey in 1208, on his way back to Rome. As a response, the Pope, in what is known as the Albigensian Crusade, in reference to the Languedoc center at Albi, moved in to extirpate the heresy. Finally, in 1229, the Pope established the Inquisition to root out the Cathars, and in 1244, final defeat came upon the Cathars at their famous stronghold of Montsegur, when more than 200 Cathar priests were massacred by the Crusaders. A half-century later, the Templars would come under similar suspicions. Though the Templars had grown very powerful, by 1291, Jerusalem fell to Muslim leader Saladin, and nearly all of the Crusader holdings in Palestine came into Arab control. The Templars established their new headquarters in"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"The Holy Grail 85 Cyprus, but with the loss of the Holy Land, the purpose of their existence was lost. Suspicion about the order began to mount. The true allegiances of the order were in doubt, as it became generally believed that the Templars were engaged in forming secret pacts with the Muslims. This rumor seems to have been confirmed when the Order entered into an alliance with the Amir of Damascus against the Hospitallers of Knights of St. John. It is known that there were frequent examples of the Templars forging alliances with the Muslims, and that they had established contacts with the Ismaili Assassins in a plot to gain control of Tyre. Pope Clement V came under strong pressure from Philip IV the Fair of France at this time, and in response, in November 1307, ordered the arrest of the Templars in every country. King Philip had every Templar in France arrested on Oct. 13 of that year. On March 22, 1312, the Templars’ property throughout Europe was transferred to the Hospitalers, or confiscated by the state. Many Templars were executed or imprisoned, and in 1314 the order’s last grand master, Jacques de Molay, was burned at the stake. The Templars were charged with practicing witchcraft, of denying the tenets of the Christian faith, spitting or urinating on the cross during secret rites of initiation, worshipping a skull or head called Baphomet in a dark cave, anointing it with blood or the fat of anabaptized babies, worshipping the devil in the shape of a black cat, and committing acts of sodomy and bestiality. Despite the fact that a great number of the knights, including the Grand Master himself, Jacques du Molay, confessed to most of these accusations, modern historians continue to apologize for the Templars, instead accusing Phillip of political ambition or greed in seizing the order’s property. However, those acts of which the Templars were accused are typical of those that had been attributed in times past to the Ancient Mysteries, Gnostics or the Sabians of Harran. The Sinclairs Nevertheless, despite their supposed persecution, the Templars were reputed to have survived in Scotlland, where they were represented by the influential family of the Sinclairs. Legend has it that, when the Templars came under trial, their leader de Molay arranged for the Templar treasures to be removed in a fleet of galleys from the port of La Rochelle. The majority of these treasure ships sailed to Scotland. Templars have been suggested as the source of mounted soldiers who assisted Robert the Bruce’s forces at the battle of Bannockburn, as the Scots themselves did not have a mounted force. The Templars had apparently chosen Scotland because they knew they would be immune from attack from the Catholic Church there, because King Robert the Bruce, and the whole Scottish nation, had been excommunicated for taking up arms against King Edward II of England. The more likely"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 86 reason, however, was that they ventured to Scotland to align themselves with the bloodline that had just produced itself through the marriage of Margaret to Agatha of Bulgaria and Malcolm III of Scotland. The famous “Scottish Declaration of Independence”, which was drawn up by Bernard de Linton, Chancellor of Scotland in the year 1320, should prove of value. Preserved as it is in the Register House, Edinburgh, this historic document bearing the seals of all the Scottish barons of the day was signed by Robert the Bruce and addressed to Pope John XXII after he attempted to secure Scottish submission to Edward II of England. It reads: We know, Most Holy Father and Lord, and from the chronicles and books of the ancients gather, that among other illustrious nations, ours, to wit the nation of the Scots, has been distinguished by many honours; which, passing from the greater Scythia through the Mediterranean Sea and Pillars of Hercules, and sojourned in Spain among the most savage tribes through a long course of time, could nowhere be subjugated by any people, however barbarous; and coming thence one thousand two hundred years after the outgoing of the people of Israel, they, by many victories and infinite toil, acquired for themselves the possessions in the West which they now hold ... In their Kingdom one hundred and thirteen kings of their own royal stock, no stranger intervening, have reigned. 23 The Templar force at the Battle of Bannockburn was led by Sir William Sinclair, of a family who, say genetic researchers Elizabeth Hirschman and Donald Panther-Yates, authors of a forthcoming book, When Scotland was Jewish, were secret Jews, among the many Sephardic Jews from Spain and southern France that entered Scotland from around 1100 AD onward. The first group would have accompanied William the Conqueror and assisted in setting up the civil administration in England. Some then made their way to Scotland, around 1150, at the invitation of Malcolm III and his son David I. 24 The Sinclairs, like all Norman nobility, were also descended from the Viking, Rollo Ragnvaldsson and Poppa of Bavaria. Charles the Simple, King of France, met Rollo at the castle of St. Clair, and there made him Duke of Normandy. The Sinclairs soon multiplied to such an extent that they could not all stay at the castle of St. Clair, and were given various other castles around France. However, they all went to England with the Conqueror. One Sinclair, named William, did not like the Conqueror, his cousin, so with some other discontented barons, he went to Scotland. William St. Clair, like William the Conquerer, and Alain IV of Brittany, were descended from Conan I of Brittany. The two Williams were the grandsons of Emma of Normandy’s brother, Richard II “the Good” of Normandy, and Judith of Brittany, the daughter of Conan I of Brittany and Ermangard of Anjou. 25 It was William St. Clair, serving on a delegation for his father’s cousin, King Edward the Confessor, who escorted his successor, Edward “the Exile”,"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"The Holy Grail 87 from Hungary back to England, after which his daughter Margaret later married Malcolm III of Scotland. According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicles, in 1128, soon after the Council of Troyes, Hugh de Payens, the Templars’ first Grand Master, met with their son, King David I of Scotland. King David granted Hugues and his knights the lands of Ballantradoch, by the Firth of Forth, but now renamed Temple. King David later surrounded himself with Templars, and appointed them as “the Guardians of his morals by day and night”. 26 David married Maud of Northumberland, whose mother was Judith of Lens, the daughter of Godfroi de Bouillon’s brother, Lambert II de Boulogne, and Adeliza, the sister of William the Conqueror. Godfroi’s younger brother, Eustace III, married David’s sister, Mary Scots. Their daughter, Mathilde married Stephen I King of England, who was the son of Henry Count of Blois, and Adela of Normandy, the daughter of William the Conqueror. Adela’s brother, Henry I King of England, married David’s sister, Editha of Scotland. Their daughter, Mathilda Empress of England, married Geoffrey V, Comte d’Anjou, whose son became Henry II King of England and married Eleanor of Aquitaine. Robert the Bruce claimed the Scottish throne as a great-great-great- great grandson of David. He was also a descendant of Robert the Brus II, who married William St. Clair’s sister Agnes. Robert the Bruce was also the grandson of Walter Stewart, 3 rd High Stewart of Scotland. Walter Stewart, the sixth High Steward of Scotland, played an important part in the Battle of Bannockburn. Walter Stewart then married Majory, daughter of Robert the Bruce, and their son Robert II, eventually inherited the Scottish throne after his uncle David II of Scotland died. From them were descended all subsequent Stewart, or Stuart, kings of Scotland. Before his death, Robert the Bruce had requested that his heart be taken to Jersusalem, and buried in the Templar Church of the Holy Sepulchre. The heart was taken by Sir William Sinclair, great-grandson of the first William St. Clair, and Sir James Douglas, but the two never made it to the Holy Land, having been killed in Spain in battle with the Muslims. 27 His grandson, also named William Sinclair, in the fifteenth century, became the third Earl of Orkney, first Earl of Caithness, and High Chancellor of Scotland. William’s mother was Jill Douglas, the great-granddaughter of James Douglas. 28 James Douglas’ mother was Elizabeth Stewart, the daughter of Alexander Stewart, 4th High Steward of Scotland. 29 In 1441, King James II Stewart appointed William Sinclair to the post of Hereditary Patron and Protector of Scottish Masons. These were not Freemasons but working stone masons. It was not until well later that “speculative” Masons joined the guilds, which came to be known as Freemason. William Sinclair also designed the most sacred site in Freemasonry, Rosslyn Chapel, a church in the village of Roslin, replete with occult symbolism, and which has often been rumored to be the burial site of the Holy Grail, being the remains of Mary Magdalene."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 88 The myth of the family has recently been popularized by Dan Brown’s The Da Vinci Code. It is at Rosslyn Chapel that Sophia, the protagonist of the book, finds out about the pedigree of her parents, who, “incredibly, both had been from Merovingian families — direct descendants of Mary Magdalene and Jesus Christ. Sophie’s parents and ancestors, for protection, had changed their family names of Plantard and Saint-Clair.” 30 Dan Brown also divulges the ultimate secret of the Illuminati bloodline, which is perceived to be red hair, which of course is at its highest concentration in Scotlland. Red hair, having been introduced by their Scythian ancestors, is believed to be its characteristic trait, a mark of their Luciferian nature. Not only is Sophia a redhead, but Brown makes repeated references to the importance of red hair, and carefully notes that Mary Magdalene was portrayed by Da Vinci as having red hair, as a deliberate reference to her “sacred” heritage. According to Dan Brown, Rosslyn takes its name from the rose, which the traditional secret symbol of Mary Magdalene and the Holy Grail. As Brown explains: The chapel’s geographic coordinates fall precisely on the north-south meridian that runs through Glastonbury. This longitudinal Rose Line is the traditional marker of King Arthur’s Isle of Avalon and is considered the central pillar of Britain’s sacred geometry. It is from this hallowed Rose Line that Rosslyn — originally spelled Roslin— takes its name... or, as Grail academics preferred to believe, from the “Line of Rose”— the ancestral lineage of Mary Magdalene. 31 There are hundreds of stone carvings in the walls and in the ceiling of the Rosslyn Chapel, which represent biblical scenes, Masonic symbols, and examples of Templar iconography.

The rose, like the “rose-line” of Rosslyn, or the rose cross of the Templars, contributed the significance to an alternative name for the Illuminati, being the Order of the Rose. The origin of the skull and crossbones symbol, also known as the Jolly Roger, begins with the tale of Baldwin, brother to Godfroi of Bouillon, and first Crusader King of Jerusalem. The story is first recounted by Walter Mapp, in the twelfth century AD. Although the story at this time is not connected with the Templar Knights, at the time of their trials 1307-1314, it was well woven into the Templar legend. In fact it was called upon during the actual trials of the Templars. According to the legend, an anonymous “Lord of Sidon” was in love with a “great lady of Maraclea [Marash in Cilician Armenia]”. 2 This “Lord of Sidon” was Baldwin, and the Armenian princess, whom he married, was Arda of Armenia. She belonged to the Rubinian Royal House of Armenia, founded by her grandfather, Ruben of Cilicia. Ruben was descended from a daughter of I-Buzir Khagan of the Khazars and Priset, who married Constantin II of Abkhazia . 3 Armenia had became vulnerable to the Seljuk Turks, under Alp Arslan, in the latter half of the eleventh century AD. To escape death or servitude Gagik II, King of Armenia, and his son, named Ruben I, with some of his countrymen, went into the gorges of the Taurus Mountains, and then into Tarsus of Cilicia, where they were given shelter by the local Byzantine governor. Baldwin, who along with the rest of the Crusaders, was passing through Asia Minor, bound for Jerusalem, left the army, and was adopted by Thoros of 10 : The Name of the Rose"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 90 Edessa, Ruben’s grandson. Being enemies to both the Seljuk Turks, and the Byzantines, the Armenians readily accepted the rule of Baldwin, who was made ruler of the new crusader County of Edessa, when Thoros was assassinated. It seems that, in general, the Armenians enjoyed the rule of Baldwin, and a number of them fought alongside the crusaders. When Antioch was taken in 1097 AD, Constantine, Thoros’ father, received from the crusaders the title of baron. According to Walter Mapp, Baldwin’s wife died suddenly, and on the night of her burial, he supposedly crept to her grave, dug up her body and violated it. Then a voice from beyond ordered him to return nine months later, when he would find a son. He returned at the appointed time, opened the grave again, and found a head on the leg bones of the skeleton: a skull and crossbones. The same voice then apparently commanded him to “guard it well, for it would be the giver of all good things”, and so he carried it away with him. It became his protecting genius, and he was able to defeat his enemies by merely showing them the magic head. In due course, it passed to the possession of the Templars, where, during the trials, it came to be known as the Baphomet. The inquisitors would have picked up on the fact that the woman of the story was Armenian by background. This they would have connected with the Armenian Church and its Paulician sects. The Paulicians and the Bogomils were equated with Catharism, which the church had all but wiped out during the Albigensian Crusade. 4 In 1113 AD, Baldwin then married Adelaide del Vasto. Under the marriage agreement, if Baldwin and Adelaide had no children, the heir to the kingdom of Jerusalem would be Roger II of Sicily, Adelaide’s son by her first husband Roger I Guiscard. This Roger was to become the “Jolly Roger” of history, having flown the skull and crossbones on his ships. 5 Roger married Elvira, daughter of Alfonso VI of Castile and his Ismaili wife, Zaida. The House of Lusignan Within a century, the heirs of Rubenid dynasty were further rewarded by the grant of a kingdom known as Cilicia or Lesser Armenia, to be held as a vassal government of the Holy See and of Germany. This kingdom lasted till 1375 AD, when the Mamelukes of Egypt destroyed it. 6 During this time, continuing intermarriage between the aristocracy Armenia and the Templars produced the influential house of Lusignan, a family would come to dominate throughout the remainder of the Crusaders’ occupation of the Holy Land, and whose lineage would exercise a powerful influence in the development of the occult tradition of the Middle Ages. The lords of Lusignan were counts of La Marche. The province of France called Marche was originally a small border district, partly of Limousin and partly of Poitou. Marche first appeared as a separate fief about the middle"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"The Name of the Rose 91 of the tenth century when William III, duke of Aquitaine, gave it to one of his vassals named Boso, the great-grandson of Bernard Plantevelue, who had married Constance of Arles and Vienna, himself the grandson of Guillaume de Gellone. 7 In the twelfth century, the district passed to the family of Lusignan, in Poitou, at that time a part of the French duchy of Aquitaine, held by Queen Eleanor of England, her third son Richard, and her husband the English king Henry II. The family derive their name from the Château de Lusignan, near Poitiers, a château-fort, is still the largest castle in France. It was named Lusignan, because it was believed to have been built in single night, through magical powers, by a female demon named Melusina. Also known as Melusine, she was Melusinde, the daughter of Baldwin II. A Templar, Baldwin II married Morfia of Armenia, the sister of Toros and granddaughter of Constantine Rubenid. Baldwin II was on the First Crusade, with Geoffrey de Bouillon, between August 1096 and July 1099. He was named count of Edessa by Baldwin I, and later became king of Jerusalem in 1143. 8 The story of Melusinde, became wrapped in legend, as recounted by Jean d’Arras, in the Roman de Mélusine, written in the fourteenth century. According to d’Arras, the King of Albany, a meaning Scotland, went hunting one day and came across a beautiful lady in the forest, named Pressyne. He persuaded her to marry him and she agreed, but only on the promise that he must not enter her chamber when she birthed or bathed her children. She gave birth to triplets. When he violated this taboo, Pressyne left the kingdom, together with her three daughters, and traveled to the lost Isle of Avalon. On her fifteenth birthday, Melusina, the eldest, asked why they had been taken to Avalon. Upon hearing of their father’s broken promise, she sought revenge. She and her sisters captured Elynas and locked him in a mountain. Pressyne became enraged, and Melusine was condemned to take the form of a serpent from the waist down, until she should meet a man who would marry her under the condition of never seeing her on a Saturday. Melusina now went roaming through the world in search of the man who was to deliver her. She passed through the Black Forest, and that of Ardennes, and at last she arrived in the forest of Poitou. Just as her mother had done, she laid a condition, that he must never enter her chamber on a Saturday, an allusion to the witches Sabbath. He broke the promise and saw her in the form of a part-woman part-serpent. She forgave him. Only when, during a disagreement with her, he called her a “serpent” in front of his court, did she assumed the form of a dragon, provided him with two magic rings and flew off, never to return. 9 Baldwin II had no male heirs but had already designated his daughter Melisende to succeed him. He wanted to safeguard his daughter’s inheritance by marrying her to a powerful lord, and so chose Fulk V of Anjou, after he had been married to his first wife, through whom he fathered Georffrey Plantagenet. Fulk V was also the brother of Ermengarde of Anjou, who married Alain IV"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 92 of Brittany. Fulk V joined the crusade in 1120, and become a close friend of the Knights Templar. After his return he began to subsidize the Templars, and maintained two knights in the Holy Land for a year. The son of Fulk V and Melusinde was Amalric I King of Jerusalem, who married Agnes de Courtenay, Princess of Sidon, granddaughter of Templar, Joscelin I, comte d’Edessa, and Beatrice Rupenid, daughter of Constantine I Rupenid. Their daughter Sybilla, Queen of Jerusalem, married Guy de Lusignan. The House of Lusignan were descended from Herbert of Thoüars, who lived from 940 to 988 Ad. His great-grandson was Hugh V of Lusignan, who married Almodie de la Marche. Almodie had also been married to Pons III Taillefer Count of Toulouse, through whom she had two sons, Raymond IV of Toulouse, and William IV of Toulouse, whose daughter Philippa married William IX the Troubadour Duke of Aquitaine. Hugh V of Lusignan and Almodie de la Marche’s grandson, Hugh VII of Lusignan, married Sarazin of Armenia. They had two children, Aimee of Lusignan and Hugh VIII, a Templar Knight. 10 Hugh VIII “le Brun” Count of Lusignan was succeeded by three sons, Hughes, Guy and Amalric of Lusignan, who arrived in Jerusalem in the 1170s. Guy became King of Jerusalem through his marriage to Sybilla. Guy de Lusignan’s term as king is generally seen as a disaster. He was defeated by Saladin at the Battle of Hattin in 1187, and was imprisoned in Damascus as Saladin reconquered almost the entire kingdom. Upon his release, his claim to the kingship was ignored, and when Sibylla died at the Siege of Acre in 1191, he no longer had any legal right to it. Richard, now king of England and a leader of the Third Crusade, supported Guy’s claim, but in the aftermath of the crusade Conrad of Montferrat had the support of the majority of nobles. Richard then had Conrad assassinated by a team of Ismaili Assassins. 11 The heiress of Jerusalem was then Isabella of Jerusalem, Queen Sibylla’s half- sister. Isabella was also the daughter of Almaric I King of Jerusalem, but from Maria Komnena, the granddaughter of Alexius I Byzantine Emperor. Eight days after the death of Conrad, she was married to Henry II of Champagne, the son of Richard’s step-daughter, Marie de France, daughter of Eleanor of Aquitaine and Louis VII King of France. Instead, Richard sold Guy the island of Cyprus, which he had conquered on his way to Acre. Guy thereby became the first Latin lord of Cyprus. Amalric succeeded Guy in Cyprus, and also became King of Jerusalem in 1197. When Henry II de Champagne died in the same year, when a balcony or gave way and he fell out of a window, Queen Isabella then married Almaric. Sybille, the daughter of Isabella and Almaric, then married Leo II, the son of Stephen I of Armenia, the nephew of Thoros. 12 Their union began a series of reciprocal marriages as a result of which the succession of Lesser Armenia actually passes to the Lusignan, which lasted until 1375 AD, when the Mamelukes of Egypt destroyed it."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"The Name of the Rose 93 The Knight Hospitallers Most occult histories focus on the history of the Templar, both because it marks the birth of the occult tradition in the west, and because they are perceived as martyrs in the battle of “liberty” against religion. While in actual fact, the Templar holdings were handed over to their rivals, the Knights Hospitallers, who were then became aligned to the House of Lusignan. The male line of the Lusignans in the Levant died out in 1267 with Hugh II of Cyprus, Amalric’s great-grandson, though the male line continued in France until 1307. At that point, Hugh of Antioch, whose maternal grandfather had been Almaric’s son, Hugh I of Cyprus, took the name Lusignan, thus founding the second House of Lusignan, and managed to succeed his deceased cousin as Hugh III King of Cyprus. Hugh III’s mother was the granddaughter of Amalric, and his father was Henry I of Antioch. Henry I of Antioch was the grandson of Bohemund III of Antioch, whose father was Raymond I of Poitiers, the son of William IX the Troubadour of Aquitaine, and whose mother was Constance of Antioch, daughter of Bohemond II Guiscard prince of Antioch, and Alix de Rethel, another daughter of Baldwin II and Morphia of Armenia. These new Lusignans remained in control of Cyprus until 1489. They were rulers of Jerusalem, or more accurately, Acre, from 1268 until the fall of the city in 1291. Also after 1291 the Lusignans continued to claim the lost Jerusalem, and occasionally attempted to organize crusades to recapture territory on the mainland. The Lusignans also intermarried with the royal families of the Principality of Antioch and the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia. Hugh III’s second son, Henri II recovered possession of Acre, and in 1286 was crowned king of Jerusalem at Tyre. The stronghold of Acre from the time of its capture by Richard, to its final conquest by the Muslims, formed for two hundred years the base of the crusading empire in Palestine. There were headquartered both the orders of the Templars and of the Hospitallers. In 1291, the Muslims attacked Acre with an army of 200,000 men. Of the Templars, including their Grand Master, only ten escaped of five hundred knights. Henry II, the patriarch, and the Grand Master of the Hospitallers, with the few survivors, escaped back to Cyprus. However, on their return to Cyprus, the Templars conspired to place Henry II’s brother Almaric, Prince of Tyre, on the throne. Henry II was sent in confinement in Armenia. But, it was at this time, in 1306, under pressure from Phillip IV king of France, that the Pope summoned Jacques de Molay, the Grand Master, from Cyprus to answer the charges of heresy. In 1308, Almaric received letters from the Pope directing him to arrest all the Templars in Cyprus. Their property was handed over to the Hospitallers, and after the assassination of Almaric, they supported Henri II’s return to the throne of Cyprus."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 94 Therefore, the arrest of the Templars seems merely to have been a pretext to transfer their property to the Hospitallers. The nobility of Europe had been calling for a unification of the orders of the Templars and the Hospitallers, but Jacques de Molay was resisting the move. Following the fall of Acre, when Phillip IV of France was calling for a renewed Crusade, de Molay again refused participation. In 1309, after over two years of campaigning, the Hospitallers captured the island of Rhodes, and were then known as the Knights of Rhodes. They were eventually forced from there by the Ottoman Turks, and then settled in Malta, after which they were renamed as the Knights of Malta. The Order of the Garter Again, in England, the property of the Templars was also transferred to the Knights Hospitallers, by King Edward II, the son-in-law of Phillip IV of France. Edward II was married to Phillip IV’s daughter, Isabella of France. But Edward II initially refused to implement the papal order enforced by his father-in-law. Between October 13, 1307 and January 8, 1308, the Templars went unmolested in England. During this period many fugitive Templars, seeking to escape torture and execution, fled to apparent safety there. Although, after the intercession of Pope Clement V, King Edward II ordered the seizure of members of the order in England on January 8, 1308. Only handfuls of Templars were duly arrested however. But most Templars in England, as well as elsewhere outside France, altogether escaped arrest, let alone torture and execution. 13 As a result, the traditions of the Templars seems to have taken on a new guise, under the Order of the Garter, founded by Edward II’s son, Edward III King of England. Edward III’s sister, Joanna, married David II King of Scotland, the son of Robert the Bruce. While, in exile in the French court, it was David who created the The Guarde De Ecosse, derived from the Templar faction known as Scots Guard who came to the aid of Robert the Bruce. As the Scots Guard continued through the years, two of the prominent families involved in its history were the Sinclairs and the Stuarts. In France, they become the Personal Bodyguard to the French Kings, in perpetuity. 14 The inspiration of the Order of the Garter, founded in 1348, as “a society, fellowship and college of knights.” was the King Arthur and the Round Table. Various legends have been described to explain the origin of the Order. The most popular legend involves the “Countess of Salisbury”, possibly Edward’s cousin, Joan of Kent. While the Countess was dancing with or near Edward at Eltham Palace, her garter is said to have slipped from her leg to the floor. When the surrounding courtiers snickered, the king supposedly picked it up and tied it to his own leg, exclaiming Honi soit qui mal y pense, meaning “evil upon he who thinks it”. This phrase has since become the motto of the Order."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"The Name of the Rose 95 As historian Margaret Murray pointed out, the garter is an emblem of witchcraft. Garters are worn in various rituals and are also used as badges of rank. The garter is considered the ancient emblem of the high priestess. In some traditions, a high priestess who becomes Queen Witch over more than one coven adds a silver buckle to her garter for each coven under her. According to Murray: The importance of the lace or string among the witches was very great as it was the insignia of rank. The usual place to carry it on the person was round the leg where it served as a garter. The beliefs of modern France give the clue as to its importance. According to traditions still current, there is a fixed number of witches in each canton, of whom the chief wears the garter in token of his (or her) high position; the right of becoming chief is said to go by seniority. In Haute Bretagne a man who makes a pact with the Devil has a red garter. 15 Murray believed that all the Plantagenets were witches. She said Edward III founded two covens. As the story is to be understood, therefore, Edward did not wish to have the people think that the Countess was a witch. Edward III’s actions were to let Lady Salisbury know that her secret of her witch-hood was safe with him, because he himself was a priest of a coven. According to another legend about the Order, King Richard the Lionhearted was inspired in the twelfth century by St George the Martyr, while fighting in the Crusades, to tie garters around the legs of his knights, who subsequently won the battle. King Edward III supposedly recalled the event in the fourteenth century when he founded the Order. St. George, the patron saint of England, Georgia and Moscow, is the origin of the knightly tale of rescuing a maiden from a dragon. The traditional account of St. George’s, a soldier of the Roman Empire who later became a Christian martyr, is considered to have originated in the fourth century AD. George was a Cappadocian, born in Cilicia, and his mother was from Lydda, Palestine. According to the legend, a dragon was threatening a town in Libya, and the people were forced to sacrifice their sheep to appease it. However, when their sheep ran out, they starting sacrificing their children, chosen by means of a lottery. Eventually, the kings daughter was chosen. Saint George, then a knight errant, wounds the dragon with his lance. He then instructs the princess to remove her girdle and to use it around the dragon’s neck. The princess then leads the dragon back to the city, and Saint George tells the people he will kill the dragon if the entire town will become Christians. The dragon is killed and the townspeople are all baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Though recounted with a veneer of Christianity, the story of St. George is obviously a cryptic occult tale. The legend is a Christian adaptation of the typical dual of the Middle Eastern dying-god against the Sea-Dragon. The Dragon is Baal, and the reference to child-sacrifices in the legend is an allusion to the practice that was typical of his cult in ancient times. Historians note that"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 96 the origin of the saint is Cappadocia, and is similar to the ancient god named Sabazios. The rites of Dionysus were the same as those performed in honor of Cybele in Asia Minor. Known as the Magna Mater, the Great Mother, Cybele, was identified with Venus and worshipped as the goddess of fertility. Her consort was Attis, known Adonis. Attis, named after the Phrygian name for goat, 16 became one with Dionysus-Sabazius, or assumed some of his characteristics. 17 The cult of St. George first reached England when the Templars, who were introduced to the cult presumably through their contact with the Rupenids of Armenian Cilicia, returned from the Holy Land in 1228. The battle flag of the Templars, known as the Beauseant, in some versions had four quarters, black and white, with a red cross patee in the center. Others, however, say that the red cross had straight arms, like the St. George cross of England. 18 An account known as the Golden Legend, recounts that St. George appeared during the First Crusade, with such a cross, emblazoned on his white armour, as he led the liberation of Jerusalem from the Muslims. 19 The War of the Roses The symbolism of the Order of the Garter is closely connected with that of the Rose, the most important symbol of the Illuminati bloodline. Another is the lily. The second chapter of the Song of Solomon, the most important of ancient Kabbalistic texts, begins with, “I am the rose of Sharon, and the lily of the valleys.” Originally, the fleur-de lis was a common Jewish symbol. Not only are lilies frequently mentioned in the Songs of David, but early Jewish coinage also featured similar lilies. 20 The great Kabbalistic book, the Zohar, begins with an exposition of the mystical significance of the lily, which it describes as being the symbol of the “Jewish congregation”. 223 The fleur-de- lis, a highly stylized depiction of the real flower, began to be adopted as the heraldic symbol of the House of Capet and the kings of France with King Philip I. According to the Zohar, so too is the rose also a symbol of the “Jewish Congregation”, who are in continuing “exile”, longing for redemption, like a bride longing to return to her “beloved”. Basically, the Song of Songs is a mystical allegory of the love between the dying-god and the goddess. Often called the “Mystical Rose of Heaven”, the rose has symbolized the Virgin Mary, who, esoterically, is understood to represent the goddess, or Venus. In Grail lore, the rose is supposed to refer to Mary Magdalene, and is featured throughout Rosslyn chapel. The rose was composed of five petals, to recall the five-pointed star, or pentagram of Lucifer. The rose then became a symbol of the ruling House of Plantagenet. The Plantagenets ruled England from 1154 and Ireland from 1185. The primary line of the dynasty is considered to have ended with the deposition of Richard"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"The Name of the Rose 97 II of England in 1399. Two secondary lines ruled from 1399 to 1485 as the House of Lancaster and the House of York. The House of York was a dynasty of English Kings descended from Richard, Duke of York. The symbol of the House of York was the White Rose of York. And, the House of Lancaster, whose symbol was the Red Rose, were opponents of the House of York in the Wars of the Roses, an intermittent Civil war which affected England and Wales during the fifteenth century. The antagonism between the two houses started with the overthrow of King Richard II by his cousin, Henry Bolingbroke, Duke of Lancaster, in 1399, who was crowned as Henry IV. Henry V’s short reign was challenged by Richard, Earl of Cambridge, a grandson of Edward III, but he was executed in 1415 for treason. Henry V died in 1422, and Cambridge’s son, Richard, Duke of York, grew up to challenge his successor, King Henry VI. Richard Duke of York was the great-grandson of Edward III. He was also a member of the Order of the Garter. In the person of Richard Duke of York, we have another example of the pivotal conspiratorial role usually played by a figure in whom the various branches of the bloodline, having been divergent for some time, are recombined. Richard was created Earl of March by Henry VI King of England in 1425. The Earls of March derived their titles from the French la Marche, and represented the combined heritage of the House of Brittany and of Lusignan, helping to explain his motivation behind his attempt to seize the crown. The sister of Hughes VIII of Lusignan, Aimée, married vicomte Guillaume de Thoüars, whose mother was Agnes of Poitiers, the daughter of William IX the Troubadour of Aquitaine. Their son was Guy de Thouars, who married Constance Duchess of Brittany, daughter of Conan IV of Brittany, great-grandson of Alain IV of Brittany, thus incorporating the line of Fisher Kings. Alain IV himself married Ermisende of Anjou, the daughter of Fulk IV of Anjou, after she had been married to William IX of Aquitaine. Alain IV’s son, Conan III, married Matilda, illegitimate daughter of King Henry I of England. Conan IV, his grandson, married Margaret of Huntington, was the granddaughter of David I of Scotland. Guy and Constance’s daughter, Alix de Thoüars, was the mother of Yolande de Penthièvre, who married Hugues XI “le Brun”, sire de Lusignan, Comte de la Marche and Angouleme, also a Templar. Their son, Hughes XII “le Brun”, was the father of Jeanne de Lusignan, who was the mother of Joan of Geneville. 22 Joan of Geneville married Roger Mortimer, first Earl of March, regent of England during minority of Edward III, and usurper who had supplanted Edward II. 23 Mortimer was a founding member of the Order of the Garter. Thus, by marrying Roger Mortimer, Joan of Geneville introduced the bloodline of King Arthur, formerly exclusive to the royalty of Wales, into the House of Plantagenet. 24 Their great-grandson, Edmund de Mortimer, Third Earl of March, married Philippa Plantagenet, whose father was the second son of Edward III king of England. Their grandchild, Anne de Mortimer, married"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 98 Richard Earl of Cambridge, to father Richard Duke of York. 25 Richard was the first to use the surname Plantagenet since Geoffrey of Anjou, and did so to emphasize that his claim to the throne was stronger than that of Henry VI. With King Henry’ VI’s insanity in 1452, Richard was made Lord Protector, but had to give up this position with the King’s recovery and the birth of his heir, Edward of Westminster. Richard gradually gathered together his forces, however, and the civil wars known as the Wars of the Roses eventually broke out in 1455. The House of York was victorious over the Lancastrians, and though Richard had been unable to seize the throne for himself, Parliament did agree to the compromise of making him heir to the throne, in effect recognizing the Yorkist claim to the throne as superior to the Lancastrian one. Meanwhile, the Lancastrians, led by Henry’s wife, Margaret of Anjou, continued the war, during which Richard was finally killed in 1460, along with his second son, Edmund, Earl of Rutland. Nevertheless, Richard’s eldest son finally succeeded in putting the Yorkist dynasty on the throne in 1461 as Edward IV of England. Edward IV, however, disappointed his allies when he married Elizabeth of Woodville. Again, in her we have an example of a conspiratorial attempt to install a member of the bloodline. Elizabeth had insisted on marriage, which took place secretly on May 1, 1464, at her family home, with only the bride’s mother and two ladies in attendance. Thus, Elizabeth managed to reintroduce the lost branch of the Lusignans and of Brittany into the Rose lineage. These surviving lines of Lusignan, stemming from Alix of Thouars’ two children, and the descendants of Almaric of Lusignan, culminated in the person of Pierre I Count of St. Pol. Jean I, seigneur de Beaurevoir & de Richebourg, a descendant of Alix’s son, John of Brittany, married Marguerite d’Enghien, comtesse de Brienne, who was descended from Almaric of Lusignan. Almaric of Lusignan had a son by another woman, before marrying Isabeau Queen of Jerusalem, the daughter of Almaric King of Jerusalem, grandson of Baldwin II and Morphia of Armenia. That son was Hughes I King of Cyprus, who married Alix of Jerusalem, the daughter of Isabeau Queen of Jerusalem by another man, Henri II “le Jeune”, comte Palatin de Champagne. The son of Jean I Seigneur de Beaurevoir and Richebourg, and Margerite of countess of Brienne was Pierre Count of St. Pol, the grandfather of Elizabeth Woodville. With Edward’s sudden death in 1483, Elizabeth briefly became Queen Mother, but on June 25, 1483, her marriage was declared null and void by Parliament, and all her children were declared illegitimate. Edward’s brother, Richard III, accepted the crown. Elizabeth Woodville was widely believed to have been a witch, and Richard III tried to show there had never been any valid marriage between Edward and Elizabeth, that it was result of love magic perpetrated Elizabeth and her mother.

Henry Tudor’s forces defeated Richard’s in 1485 and Henry Tudor, exactly thirtieth male-line descendant of King Arthur, became King Henry VII of England. Elizabeth Woodville’s marriage to Edward IV was declared to have been valid, and thus their children were once again legitimized. Henry then strengthened his position by marrying Elizabeth of York, daughter of Edward IV and the best surviving Yorkist claimant.

This took place largely in the period after the Templar persecution, following which much of the occult community was forced underground, as a result of pressure from the Catholic Inquisition to suppress witchcraft. Though lying dormant for nearly three centuries, this same occult underground would choose to again resurface, under the name of the Order of the Rosy Cross. Again, their conspiracy was focused around the reunification of the lost branches of the bloodline, this time between the Stuarts and the House of Guelph. Though the House of Guelph remained distinct from those developments in the bloodline taking place in Scotland, they were developed from a Guilhemid line, and again, from that person who seems to have acted as the most important gateway in the original nexus of this Luciferian family, Dubrawka of Bohemia, the daughter of Boleslav ‘the Cruel’ of Bohemia. When Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor, died without an heir, there was controversy about the succession. Frederick and Conrad, of the Hohenstauffen dynasty and Dukes of Swabia, were grandsons of Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor and nephews of Henry V. As duke of Franconia, Conrad supported the unsuccessful candidacy of his brother, Frederick II, Duke of Swabia, for the kingship of Germany. Elected king of Italy in December 1127 AD, in opposition to Lothair III, Conrad acknowledged Lothair as emperor only in 1135 AD. The election of Lothair II, to the throne as Holy Roman Emperor, was supported by Henry “the Black”, Duke of Bavaria. Henry the Black belonged to the House of Guelph, descended from Welf, a ninth century Frankish count, through his son, Conrad of Auxerre. Welf was married to Hedwig of Saxony, who was descended from Saint Arnulf of the Franks, grandfather of Pippin II. 1 Welf’s other child, Judith of Bavaria, married Louis the Pious, son of Charlemagne, while his daughter Dhuoda, married Bernard of Septimania, the son of William of Gellone. 2 Conrad of Auxerre was the father of Guelph I, and his son, Eticho, married Judith of Wessex, daughter of Ethelwulf, the King of 11 : The Holy Roman Empire"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 102 England, and granddaughter of Redburga, sister to William of Gellone. 3 The House of Welf is the older branch of the House of Este, a dynasty whose oldest known members lived in Lombardy in the ninth century AD. For this reason, it is sometimes also called Welf-Este. Azo II of Este married Cunigonde of Bavaria, the daughter of Guelph II, and Judith of Luxemberg, daughter of Sainte Cunigunde’s brother Frederick of Luxembourg. Their son was Guelf IV, who inherited the property of the Elder House of Welf, and became duke of Bavaria in 1070 AD. He then married Judith of Flanders, the daughter of Baldwin IV of Flanders and Eleanor of Normandy, another daughter of Robert II Duke of Normandy, who was also the grandfather of William the Coqueror and William St. Clair. 4 In 1089 AD, their son, Guelph V married countess Matilda of Tuscany. 232 Guelph V’s brother, however, Henry “the Black”, married Wulfhildis, the daughter of the last Billung duke of Saxony. The duchy of Saxony had originally belonged to the Saxon noble family of Billung, who at the same time were the Ottonian dynasty of the Holy Roman Empire. After the extinction of the male line of Billungs, the duchy was given to Lothar II, descended from Svyatoslav of Kiev, who then also became Emperor for a short time. 5 The mother of Wulfhildis was Sophia of Hungary, whose father was Bela Arpad King of Hungary, the grandson of Michael Arpad, brother to Geza, while her grandmother was Katun Kometopoulos, daughter of Samuil, the Bogomil King of Bulgaria. When Henry the Black’s brother, Guelph V, died childless in 1120 AD, he succeeded him as Duke of Bavaria. Henry the Black had initially shown his allegiance to his son-in-law Frederick II, Duke of Swabia, but switched his support, after Lothair promised that Gertrud, his only daughter and heir, would marry his son Henry X “the Proud” Duke of Bavaria and also of Saxony. After the death of the intervening king and emperor Lothar III, in 1137 AD, Conrad became Conrad III of Germany. Henry the Proud had been the favoured candidate in the imperial election, against Conrad III of the Hohenstaufen, but lost, as the other princes feared his power and temperament, and he was dispossessed of his duchies by Conrad III. Conrad III became Holy Roman Emperor in 1138 AD, being the first of the Hohenstaufen dynasty, which was about to restore the glory of the Empire even under the new conditions of the 1122 Concordat of Worms. When King Conrad III had dispossessed Henry’s father, he had handed his duchies of Saxony to Albert “the Bear”, and Bavaria to Leopold IV of Austria. Albert the Bear was himself a descendant of Dubrawka and Mieszko, and his mother was Eilika of Saxony, the sister of Wulfhildis. 7 Leopold IV’s father, Leopold III of Austria, also a descendant of Dubrawka, 8 had married Agnes Salien, daughter of Henry VI Holy Roman Emperor. Leopold IV married Mary of Bohemia, daughter of Sobeslav and Adelheid Arpad. 9 Leopold IV’s sister Gertrud married Vladislav of Bohemia. Their son Friedrich King of Bohemia married Elizabeth Arpad. 10"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"The Holy Roman Empire 103 Conrad III was succeeded by Frederick I Barbarossa, the grandson of Henry IV, and whose mother, Judith of Bavaria, was descended from the Guilhemid Houses of Flanders and Normandy. It was Babarossa who first called the Empire “holy”, and introduced the idea of the “Romanness” of the Empire, as an attempt to justify the Empire’s power independently of the now strengthened Pope. Barbarossa made several unsuccessful attempts to regain Italy. The supporters of Frederick became known as Ghibellines. While campaigning in Italy to expand imperial power there, the Lombard League and its supporters became known as Guelphs, “Guelph” being most probably an Italian language form of Welf. Henry the Proud did not relinquish claims to his inheritance, and Conrad III had returned Saxony to him in 1142 AD. In 1156 AD, Bavaria was also reacquired by his son Henry ‘the Lion’, a decision of the new Emperor Frederick Barbarossa. Both Henry the Lion and Frederick Barbarossa were from Henry the Black and Wulfhildis of Saxony. Frederick Barbarossa was the son of Henry the Lion’s sister, Judith of Brunswick, who married Frederick of Swabia. Henry the Lion was both Duke of Bavaria and Duke of Saxony. He was the son of Henry the Proud, and Gertrud, only daughter of Emperor Lothair III, Holy Roman Emperor and his wife Richenza of Nordheim, heiress to the Saxon territories of Nordheim and the properties of the Brunones, counts of Brunswick. He was the most powerful of the German princes of his time. At the height of his reign, Henry ruled over a vast territory stretching from the coasts of the North Sea and Baltic Sea to the Alps, and from Westphalia to Pomerania. He achieved this great power in part by his political and military acumen, in part through the legacies of his four grandparents. 11 Henry is the founder of Munich and Lübeck; he also founded and developed the cities of Stade, Lüneburg and Brunswick. In Brunswick, his capital, he had a bronze lion, the Lion of Judah, his heraldic animal. In 1168 AD, Henry married Matilda of Anjou, daughter of Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine. However, when Henry the Lion had declined to participate in Frederick Babarossa’s Italian campaigns, after those expeditions ended in disaster, the furious Emperor retaliated by having Henry stripped of his lands. Henry the Lion was finally deposed as duke of Saxony, and Bavaria, which was awarded as fief to Otto I Herzog Duke of Bavaria of the Wittelsbach family, which ruled from 1180 to 1918. 12 Otto’s son Ludwig I of Bavaria was married to the daughter of Elizabeth Arpad, Ludmila of Bohemia. When Frederick sent troops against Henry, his allies deserted him, and he finally had to submit in November 1181 AD. He was exiled from Germany for three years, and stayed with his father-in-law, Henry II of England, in Normandy, before being allowed back into Germany in 1185 AD. He was exiled again in 1188, and his wife Matilda died in 1189 AD. In 1189 AD, Fredrerick Barbarossa joined Richard the Lionhearted in the Third Crusade, during which he was killed.

In 1194 AD, with his end approaching, Henry made his peace with the Emperor, and returned to his much diminished lands, where he finished his days as the duke of Brunswick. Despite these initial disputes, through intermarriage, the several lines of Henry the Lion, and those to whom his father’s lands had initially been bequeathed, Otto I Duke of Bavaria, and Albert I “the Bear” Margrave of Brandenburg, were reunited in the person of Frederick I Margrave of Brandenburg, from whom would emerge the bloodlines that would figure importantly in the intrigues of the occult underground. The son of Albert I “the Bear” was Bernard III Duke of Saxony, who married Judith of Poland, the daughter of Mieszko III, and Elizabeth Arpad, granddaughter Geza Arpad and of Vladimir I of Kiev. Bernard’s son, Albert I of Saxony married Helene of Brunswick-Luneburg. 13 Their daughter, Helene of Saxony, married Friedrick III of Nurnburg, the son of Conrad III. Their great-grandson was Frederick I of Brandenburg. Frederick’s mother was Elisabeth Princess of Bayern-Landshut. Elisabeth’s mother was Mathilda of Wittelsbach, the daughter of Ludwig IV Holy Roman Emperor, who was the great-grandson of Henry the Lion. Ludwig’s mother was Matilda of Habsburg, daughter of Rudolf I of Habsburg, Holy Roman Emperor. Frederick’s sons included John III the Alchemist. Initially Burgrave of Nuremberg, Frederick was created margrave of Brandenburg. In 1320 the Brandenburg Ascanian line came to an end, and from 1323 until 1373, Brandenburg was under the control of the Wittelsbach family, better known as rulers of Bavaria, after it was initially lost to them from Henry the Lion. After a period of rule by the Imperial Luxembourg dynasty, however, the margravate was granted 1415 by the Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund, to Frederick, becoming Elector of Brandenburg. and of the house of Hohenzollern, that would rule until the end of World War I. The Habsburgs As it was the birthplace of the emerging bloodline, in Drubrawka of Bohemia, Prague would become the center of occult intrigue in the Middle Ages. This power it would come to exercise through perhaps the most powerful family of the all, the Habsburgs. This family, who would command the headquarters for the developments and spread of the New Kabbalah, and the most significant Jewish community of the High Middle Ages, was itself an important fusion of the various strains of the Luciferian bloodline, but also of the Jewish exilarchs as well. In the thirteenth century, the Habsburg family began to extend its influence over Austria, then ruled by descendants of the Arpads, who governed as Margraves and and then Dukes. The Kings of Austria were descended from"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"The Holy Roman Empire 105 Frowiza, who was the child of Maria, daughter of Geza, and Otto the Doge of Venice. As the Habsburg continued their policy of acquisition through dynastic marriages with the houses of Bohemia, Moravia and Hungary, the double-headed eagle became their heraldic symbol. Bohemia was originally governed by the Premysl dynasty that intermarried with the Piasts. The first king of Bohemia was the father of Dubrawka, Boleslav I ‘the Cruel’. His great-grandson Vratislav II, who became King of Bohemia in 1085 AD, married Swatawa Piast, the daughter of Casimir I, the great-grandson of Mieszko, and Dobronega, the daughter of Vladimir I, King of the Rus of Kiev, whose father was Svyatoslav, who originally conquered Kiev from the Khazars. His son, Vladislav II King of Bohemia married Gertrud of the Brabenberg dynasty of Austria, descended from Frowiza. Vladislav was succeeded by his son Ottokar I, who married Constance Arpad, daughter of Bela III Arpad, and Princess Marguerite of France. Marguerite was daughter to Louis VII King of France, who had formerly been married to Eleanor of Aquitaine, and Costanza, from the Guilhemid dynasty of Castile. Ottokar’s son, Wenceslas King of Bohemia, married Kunigunde of Swabia, who was the daughter of Philip Hohenstauffen, Frederick Barbarossa’s son, and Irene of Constantinople. In 1251 AD, Ottokar’s son, Ottokar II, King of Bohemia, secured his election as duke of Austria, where he strengthened his position by marrying Margaret, the daughter of Leopold VI of Austria and his wife Theodora. Theodora was the daughter of Isaak II Angelos, Byzantine Emperor, and Margaret Arpad, sister of Constance Arpad. 14 Ottokar II was replaced by the Habsburg ruler Rudolf in 1273 AD. However, Rudolf I’s son, Holy Roman Emperor Albert I, was assassinated in 1308 AD, after which the title was denied the Habsburgs for more than a century. Holy Roman Emperor, Charles IV of Luxemburg, then became King of Bohemia in 1348. He was born as Wenceslaus, but later changed his name to Charles at his confirmation. Charles’ mother was Elizabeth of Bohemia, the granddaughter of Ottokar II. Her mother was Jutta of Habsburg, daughter of Rudolf I. She married John of Luxemburg, son of Henry VII Holy Roman Emperor. Charles IV’ son was Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor, and king of Hungary and Bohemia, who, in 1431, commissioned the formation of the Order of the Dragon, to protect the royal family. Sigismund was a member of the Order of the Garder, and therefore, the dragon was allusion to the dragon slain by St. George. Included in the Order were a number of important vassals and nobles, like Vlad II Dracul, father of Vlad III Dracula, also known as “Count Dracula”, or Vlad “the Impaler” of Transylvania. The post-title “Dracul” was a reference to being invested with the Order of the Dragon. Between 1349 and 1411 AD, the Habsburgs also absorbed Moravia. At the end of the eighth century, Great Moravia, which encompassed Bohemia, Hungary,"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 106 and several other states, had also fallen to the invading Magyars. Moravia then came under the rule of Boleslaus I of Poland between 999 and 1019 AD, before becoming part of Bohemia in 1019 AD. It was raised to the status of a Margrave in 1182 AD, and shared its history with Bohemia, and came under the House of Luxembourg, when Charles IV became Margrave of Moravia in 1334. After Albert II, King of Bohemia and Hungary, and Duke of Austria, became Holy Roman emperor in 1438, the imperial office remained in Habsburg hands for the next four hundred years. Albert II’s father was the grandson of Albert III Duke of Austria, the son of Albert I Holy Roman Emperor. Albert III of Austria married Beatrix of Hohenzollern, the sister of Frederick I of Brandenburg. Their son was Albert IV of Austria, who married Joanna of Bavaria, the sister of Joanna of Bavaria, whose father was the brother of Matilda of Wittelsbach. Albert IV and Joanna’s son was Albert II Holy Roman Emperor. 15 Albert II was succeeded by Frederick III Holy Roman Emperor. Frederick III was the son of Ernst II “the Iron” of Austria, a Habsburg, and a member of the Order of the Dragon, and Cymburgis of Mosavia, from the Piast dynasty. Friedrich III was also a member of the Order of the Garter, and married Eleanor de Aviz, Princess of Portugal, the daughter of Eleanor of Aragon, whose brother, Alfonso V King of Aragon and Naples, was a member of the Order of the Dragon. The Houses of Aragon, like the houses of Castile and Sicily, derive from the Piast dynasty. The House of Castile is descended from Alfonso VII “the Emperor” of Galicia, Leon and Castile, and Richeza of Poland, the daughter of Wladislaw II of Poland, a descendant of Mieszko I, and Adelaide, the daughter of Michael Arpad. The House of Aragon is descended from Bela III, King of Hungary. Bela III was descended and Vasul, the son of Michael Arpad and Adelaide the daughter of Mieszko King of Poland. Vasul married Katun Kometopoulos, the daughter of Samuil, the Bogomil King of Bulgaria. Bela III married Agnes of Chatillon, the granddaughter of Bohemund II Prince of Antioch. Their granddaughter, Yolande Arpad, married James I King of Aragon. When James’ father was slain, when he took up arms against the Albigensian crusade on behalf of the Cathars, James had been entrusted to Guillen de Monredon, head of the Templars in Spain and Provence. 16 Alfonso VIII, grandson of Alfonso VII, married Eleanor of Anjou, daughter of Henry II of England and Eleanor of Aquitaine. Their daughter, Blanche of Castile, married Louis VIII King of France. Their grandson was Charles II King of Jerusalem and Sicily, who married Maria of Hungary of the Arpad dynasty. Sigismund had no children and adopted the son of Frederick III, Maximilian I, also member of the Order of the Garter, who became Holy Roman Emperor in 1493.

After the marriage of Maximilian I, with Mary,"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"The Holy Roman Empire 107 heiress of Burgundy in the Low Countries, and the marriage of his son Philip with Juana, heiress of Spain and its newly-founded empire, Charles V inherited an empire where “the sun does not set”. In 1521, Maximilian’s grandson, Charles V, who had also been King Charles I of Spain, assigned the Austrian lands his brother and successor Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor. Ferdinand was descended from Paloma, who belonged to the bin Yahya family, a Portuguese family of rabbis of Spain and Portugal in the Middle Ages, and before that going back to the Exilarchs in Babylonia and Persia, members of which were prominent in Portugal, Spain, Italy, and Turkey. Paloma, married Federico of Castile. 17 Paloma and Federico’s grandmother was the sister of Alfonso IV of Portugal, the Grand Master of the Knights of Christ. Following their suppression elsewhere, the Templars did not go underground in Portugal, but merely changed their name to the Knights of Christ, and Alfonso IV, a descendant of Roger II Guiscard, became their first Grand Master. Alfonso IV initiated a policy of sending ships on long voyages out into the Atlantic. This tradition was continued by his great-grandson, Henri the Navigator, who also became the order’s Grand Master, with the aim of finding a seaway to India round the southern tip of Africa. Henry the Navigator was the third son of John I of Portugal, the founder of the Aviz dynasty; and of Philippa of Lancaster, the daughter of John of Gaunt. Henry VI of England awarded him the Order of the Garter. 18 Paloma and Federico’s granddaughter married John II King of Aragon, and their son was Ferdinand II of Spain, who, along with his wife Queen Isabella, sponsored Knight of Christ, Columbus, to sail to America. Isabella’s father, John I of Portugal, was a member of the Order of the Garter, as was her husband Ferdinand. Ferdinand and Isabella’s daughter, Queen Juana married Phlip I Habsburg, King of Spain, and their son was Ferdinand I, also belonged to the Order. He succeeded to the title of King of Bohemia in 1526, and as Ferdinand I of the Holy Roman Empire in 1558. Ferdinand married Anna of the Jagellon dynasty, which descends from the Piasts, who between the fourteenth century and sixteeth century reigned, as grand dukes of Lithuania, kings of Poland, of Hungary and of Bohemia. Ferdinand gained the title of King of Hungary in 1526. Jogaila, Grand Duke of Lithuania, and the founder of the dynasty in Poland, became king of Poland as Ladislaus II of Poland after converting to Christianity. He married Jadwiga of Poland, who is venerated by the Catholic Church as Saint Hedwig the Queen, patron saint of queens and united Europe. She was the youngest daughter of Louis I of the House of Angevin, King of Hungary and Poland. Louis was the great-grandson of Charles II, King of Jerusalem and Sicily, and Maria of Hungary.

It was largely as an attempt to bolster this emerging Protestant movement, that, following the union of the Stuart and Guelph bloodlines, that they formed the Order of the Rosy Cross, to mark that underground’s entry into public attention, and begin the concerted effort to incept the conspiracy to, first, supplant the power of the Catholic Church, and ultimately erect a New World Order. The Habsburg realm became internally divided when the German princes of the Empire had supported the Protestant movement against the Catholic Church, which was ostensibly defended by the Habsburg rulers. The rising tide of the Protestant movement came to a head in Bohemia, where the Kabbalistic underground surfaced in the manner of the Order of the Rosicrucians, otherwise known as the Order of the Rosy Cross. The ultimate aim of the Order was that of abolishing the Church, and replacing it with a government of “wise” rulers. As explained by occult historian Laurence Gardner: It was by no chance that Martin Luther’s protest gained support in some very influential circles, for Rome had many enemies in high places. Not the least of these enemies were the Knights Templars, and the underground Hermetic societies whose esoteric crafts had been condemned by the Catholic Inquisition. The truth was not so much that Luther gained the support of others, but that he was the willing instrument of an already active movement which endeavored to dismantle the rigid international domination of the Pope. 1 In England, the most significant consequence of the Reformation was the establishment of the independent church, created by King Henry the VIII, the son of Elizabeth of York and Edward VII. It was followed by the establishment of the Church of England under his daughter, Queen Elizabeth I. Queen Elizabeth I’s 12 : Rosicrucians and Freemasons"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 110 court was steeped in esoteric thought. An important source of these tendencies, as well as much of Rosicrucian philosophy, was a famous occultist John Dee. Dee believed that he found the secret of conjuring angels by numerical configurations in the tradition of the Kabbalah, and claimed to have gained contact with good angels, from whom he learned advancement in knowledge. While acting as Astrologer Royal to Queen Mary, who had succeeded Henry VIII to the throne, Dee was accused of high treason and practicing sorcery against Mary’s life. He was thrown in prison, but managed to clear himself of the charges, though he continued to be strongly suspected of being a magician and a conjurer. When Elizabeth became Queen after Mary’s death, Dee was fortunate enough to have the benefit of her favour, and subsequently tutored the new queen in the understanding of his own mystical writings. Elizabeth did not marry, and therefore had no direct heir. Mary Stuart, also known as Mary Queen of Scots, the granddaughter of Henry VIII’s sister, was the nearest relative, but she was Catholic. Elizabeth of York and Henry VII of England were the parents of Henry VIII, but also of Margaret Tudor, who married James IV of Scotland, thus introducing the Armenian heritage of Lusignan, and the Fisher Kings of Brittany, to the Stuart line. Their son James V of Scotland, a member of the Order of the Garter, married Marie de Guise to father Mary Queen of Scots. Revealing her affiliation to the bloodline, in 1546, Marie Guise, had signed an unusual Bond and Obligation to Sir William Sinclair Baron of Rosslyn: “In likewise that we sall be Leal and trew Maistres to him, his Counsill and Secret shewn to us we sall keep secret--and in all mattres gif to him the best and trewest Counsell we can as we sall be requirite thereto...and sall be reddy att all tymes to maintain and defend him...” 2 The House of Guise was an important branch of the Guilhemids. It had been founded in the sixteenth century, as a cadet branch of the House of Lorraine by Claude, first Duke of Guise. Claude’s great-grandfather was Rene d’Anjou, whose combined heritage provided him with the titles of Count of Provence, Count of Guise, Duke of Anjou, Duke of Lorraine, King of Hungary, King of Naples and Sicily, King of Aragon, Valencia, Majorca and Sardinia and King of Jerusalem. One of Rene’s daughters, Marguerite d’Anjou, in 1445, married Henry VI of England, and played a prominent role in the Wars of the Roses. Rene d’Anjou at one time employed Christopher Columbus, and was associated with Joan of Arc, who was the daughter of Edward I King of England and Eleanor of Castile. Edward was the son of Henry III of England and Eleanor of Provence, whose father, Raymond Berengar V Count of Toulouse, was the great-grandson of Alfonso VII King of Castile and Richenza of Poland. 3 Rene, who was well-versed in the occult, included at his court a Jewish Kabbalist known as Jean de Saint-Remy, who, according to some accounts, was the grandfather of Nostradamus. Rene’s interests also included Arthurian and Grail romances.

The Habsburg King Philip of Spain and the Catholics in France plotted for Mary Queen of Scots’ accession to the throne of England, and when Elizabeth discovered that plots to place the Scottish queen on the English throne threatened her life, she had Mary Stuart imprisoned and eventually executed. However, Mary had married Henry Stuart, who was the great-grandson of Eleanor Sinclair, the daughter of William Sinclair, and John Stewart. And, following Elizabeth’s childless death in 1603, the throne was left vacant. Thus, James VI of Scots, the son of Mary Queen of Scots and Henry Stuart, was deemed to be Elizabeth’s closest living relative. He became King James I of England, the first monarch of England of the Stuart line. It would be concern for the preservation of this line which would become the central theme of that branch of the Illuminati at the center of all its intrigues, Scottish Rite Freemasonry. Bohemia King James did not share Elizabeth’s sympathies for John Dee, and when he appealed to the king for help in clearing his reputation from charges of conjuring devils, the King ignored him. Dee finally died disgraced and in abject poverty in 1608. Prior to his death, though, and after his career in England had come to an end, John Dee had found his way to Prague, then under Habsburg Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II, where he influenced the Rosicrucian movement. Rudolph II, like his father, Maximilian II, was a member of the Order of the Garter. And, he chose to move his capital from Vienna to Prague, in Bohemia, which became an occult oriented court, a center of study in alchemy, astrology, and magic. Rudolph II devoted vast sums of money to the building of his library, which comprised of the standard corpus of Hermetic works, as well as the notorious Picatrix, an Arabic work expounding on Sabian themes. The Emperor Rudolf II’s fascination with Hermeticism was matched by his interest in Kabbalah, when his reign became a “golden age” of Jewry in Prague in Bohemia. Despite their initial persecution during the Crusades, the Jewish community of Bohemia often enjoyed exceptional privileges. Although originating in southern France, it was in Spain that the Kabbalah would develop, and where the most important medieval Kabbalistic text, the Sepher ha Zohar, or Book of Light, was produced in 1286 AD. Ultimately, the spread of Kabbalistic influence, and the occult rites it involved, or mysteries, generally known as “witchcraft”, caused the Church to become increasingly suspicious, and to eventually attempt its brutal suppression. "},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 112 Therefore, a year before the Templars were arrested, in 1307 AD, France expelled its Jewish population. The Jews had already been expelled from England in 1290 AD, by King Edward, when all the crowned heads of Europe followed his example. Saxony followed suit in 1348. On the extinction of the house of Arpad of Hungary, and under the Angevin kings who then occupied the throne, the Hungarian Jews suffered many persecutions, and were expelled in 1360, and in 1370 Belgium, in 1380 Slovakia, in 1420 Austria, and in 1444 the Netherlands. However, the anti-Jewish offensive of the papacy in the early thirteenth century little affected the conditions of Bohemia’s Jewish community. The Bohemian monarchs ignored the resolutions of the Lateran Council of 1215 AD, which set out to limit the economic and social influence of the Jewish Communities in Europe. In return, the Jews were careful to guard the independence of the Bohemian aristocracy, and became the true servants of the royal Chamber. They were given a number of concessions and freedoms by the charter issued by Ottokar II, and the tolerant government of the last Premyslid kings proved favorable to the development of the Jewish community. With the end of the Premyslid dynasty, however, the first few decades of the fourteenth century became a period of general insecurity. The long reign of Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV, though, again brought the Jews of Prague new privileges. Charles IV ensured their protection, and allowed them to settle within the walls of Prague’s New Town, which he founded in 1348. And, in 1357, Charles IV, allowed the Jews of Prague to have their own city flag, a red banner that featured, in gold, the Kabbalistic six-pointed star, known as the “Star of David”, or “Seal of Solomon”, being the first Jewish flag of its kind. Red, as demonstrated by Andrew Colin Gow, author of the Red Jews: Anti-Semitism in an Apocalyptic Age: 1200-1600, had become a color distinctly associated with the Jews. Between the thirteenth and sixteenth century, as he has shown, it became popular in German literature to identify Gog and Magog with the Lost Tribes of Israel, who collectively were referred to as “Red Jews”. As he further noted, Jews were often portrayed by medieval illustrations in Christian texts with red hair and in red clothes. According to Gow: This connection was so widely-accepted as to be included prominently in illustrations of Hebrew manuscripts, though in such cases, these depictions presumably lacked or did not evoke the negative associations generally marked by red hair. The Jews by whom these manuscripts were made and for whom they were intended seem to have attached no negative significance to the color red. Yet as we have seen, Christian iconography “saw red” in connection with Judas. The Metzgers’ manuscript illuminations suggest that to Jews as to Christians, Jews were typically red-headed and wore red clothes; it was taken for granted. 4"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"Rosicrucians and Freemasons 113 In 1557, Ferdinand I, at the instigation of his younger son, the Archduke Ferdinand, who was governor of the region, issued a decree exiling all Jews from Prague and Bohemia. Many Jewish families departed, but a number of families who managed to earn exceptions remained. This situation lasted until the Archduke’s brother, Maximilian II ascended the throne. The new king revoked all decrees of expulsion by degrees, and instead confirmed many of the forgotten privileges originally granted to the Jews. Under Rudolf II, many Jewish refugees who had been expelled from Moravia, Germany, Austria and Spain came to Prague. In Prague, Jews studied Kabbalah undisturbed. The city, says Frances Yates, “was a great center for Jewish Cabalism, and a very remarkable personality, Rabbi Loew, was prominent in Prague in the late sixteenth century.” 5 Rabbi Judah Loew ben Bezalel, also known as the Maharal of Prague, published more than fifty religious and philosophical books. Rabbi Loew became legendary as the mystical worker who created the Golem, an artificial man made of clay brought to life through magical combinations of the sacred letters of the Hebrew alphabet, which acted as a guardian over the Jews. Lurianic Kabbalah It was in Bohemia, therefore, that the most important modern development in Kabbalah took root, known as the New Kabbalah, derived by Isaac Luria. Luria’s revolutionary knew conception of Zionism and the purpose of the Jewish people in history would become the fundamental creed of two important new heresies that would go on to become the basis of all Illuminati intrigues. These were, first, the heresy in the seventeenth century, of the false messiah Shabbetai Zevi, and in the following century, that developed by one of his successors, Jacob Frank. Luria’s novel interpretations essentially fired new Messianic hopes, which were accepted positively by Jews who recently endured the expulsion from Spain. As in other parts of Europe, violent persecution had been growing in Spain and Portugal, where in 1391, hundreds of thousands of Jews had been forced to convert to the Catholicism. Publicly, the Jewish converts, known as Marranos, were Christians, but secretly they continued to practice Judaism, including following the Kabbalah. After 1540, many Marranos fled to England, Holland, France, the Ottoman Empire, Brazil and other places in South and Central America. These Marranos maintained strong family ties and became influential where they lived. In Spain, during the fifteenth century, the Marranos “crypto-Jews”, founded the Christian heresy of the Alumbrados. The Illuminati Order was not invented by Adam Weishaupt, but was rather renewed and reformed. 6 The Alumbrados, or Illuminati, claimed to have direct intercourse with God.

Therefore, like all Gnostics before them, they believed carnal desires could be indulged in, and other sinful actions committed freely without corrupting the soul. As young man, Ignatius of Loyola became a member of the Allumbrados, though, as a cover for his activities, he became very active as a Roman Catholic. Ignatius of Loyola was born in 1491, from wealthy Marranos parents a year before the expulsion of the Jews from Spain. 7 Loyola moved to Rome where he founded the Order of Jesus, known as the infamous Jesuits, which was approved by Pope Paul III in 1540. In setting up the Jesuit order, Loyola devised an elaborate spy system, so that no one in the order was safe. If there was any opposition, death was meted out swiftly. The Jesuit order not only became a destructive arm of the Roman Catholic Church, but developed into a secret intelligence service. Ultimately, the Jesuits would follow the same conspiratorial methods as the Ismailis, to undermine the religion they were purportedly representing, and for indoctrinating dupes into their subversive mission, as the following, taken from the secret oath of the Jesuits, demonstrates: You have been taught to insidiously plant the seeds of jealousy and hatred between communities, provinces, states that were at peace, and incite them to deeds of blood, involving them in war with each other, and to create revolutions and civil wars in countries that were independent and prosperous, cultivating the arts and the sciences and enjoying the blessings of peace. To take sides with the combatants and to act secretly with your brother Jesuit, who might be engaged on the other side, but openly opposed to that with which you might be connected, only that the Church might be the gainer in the end, in the conditions fixed in the treaties for peace and that the end justifies the means. Rabbi Isaac Luria was a faithful follower of Ignatius Loyola. 8 Luria’s father, a member of an Ashkenazi family from Poland and Germany, emigrated to Jerusalem. Following his father’s death, as a child, Luria was taken to Egypt. Egypt has always harboured an important Jewish community, and of Gnostic speculation, from Hellenistic times, to the Ismailis of the Fatimids, as it was in Luria’s time. It was for this reason that Egypt would figure so prominently as one of the focal points of Illuminati, even into the twentieth century, with the creation of Islamic fundamentalism. In Egypt, here he became versed in rabbinic studies, engaged in commerce, and eventually concentrated on study of the Zohar, the central work of the Medieval Kabbalah. In 1570, he went to Safed in Galilee, where he studied under Moses ben Jacob Cordovero, the greatest Kabbalist of the time, and developed his own Kabbalistic system. Although he wrote few works, Luria’s doctrines were recorded by his pupil Hayyim Vital, who presented them in a large posthumous collection. Because of this work, Lurianic"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"Rosicrucians and Freemasons 115 Kabbalah became the new thought that influenced all Jewish mysticism after him, competing with the Kabbalah of Cordovero. Luria initiated a new interpretation of the role of the Kabbalah in preparation for the arrival of the messiah. In Luria’s system, all being is said to have been in exile, that is, separated from God, since the very beginning of creation, and the task of restoring everything to its proper order is the specific role of the Jewish people. The final redemption, however, cannot be achieved merely through the advent of the Messiah, but must be brought about historically, through a long chain of actions that prepare the way. Essentially, the important notion that was transmitted to the Kabbalists was this, that they must not merely await the fulfillment of prophecy with regards to the coming of the Messiah, and the restoration of the Jewish people in the Promised Land. Rather, they ought to work actively to prepare for his appearance. First, this meant manipulating the course of fate through the use of magic, and finally, of preparing the necessary political and moral circumstances to receive his coming, that is, a New World Order. The Rosicrucians The first instance of the consequence of Luria’s thought, as appropriated by the underground occult stream, was the formation of the Order of the Rosy Cross, or the Rosicrucians. Again, the theme behind the formation of this secret society was the union of the Guelph and Stuart bloodlines. But it’s secondary was to boldly announce itself to the world, and begin its challenge against the Church. For, thought the movement initially ended in failure, it would immediately contribute to the emergence of Freemasonry, and ultimately result in the installation of a monarch over England who would issue from the unification of bloodlines, King George I. The circumstances out of which this secret society emerged, occurred as crisis came upon the Protestant movement, when Rudolph II died in 1612, threatening the immunity enjoyed by esoteric circles among the Protestants of Bohemia and other German provinces. As a consequence, the German leaders of the Protestant cause in the Palatinate of the Rhine, a small province of the Holy Roman Empire, sought means to pursue their plight against the Hapsburgs. It was at this point that the German prince Frederick V, Elector of the Palatinate, began to be seen as the ideal incumbent to take the lead of the Protestant resistance against the ruling Hapsburgs. Frederick V was descended from the House of Guelph. Specifically, he belonged to the House of Wittelsbach, hereditary rulers of the Palatinate of the Rhine. In Carolingian times, the count palatine was merely the representative of the king in the high court of justice. In 937 AD, Otto the Great appointed a count palatine for Bavaria, and several other duchies, with the Elector of Lorraine later"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 116 foremost in rank. In 1155 AD, after the death of its Elector, Frederick Barbarossa transferred the office to his half-brother Conrad, who united the lands to his own possessions on the central Rhine, and made his residence at Heidelberg. Thus the palatinate of Lorraine became the palatinate “of the Rhine”. Conrad’s daughter, Agnes of Hohenstaufen, married Henry I of Saxony and Bavaria, the son of Henry “the Lion” and Matilda of England, and their son Henry II became Elector of the Palatinate of the Rhine in 1195 AD. Henry II married Agnes of Lausitz, daughter of Conrad III, Margrave of Lausitz, and Elizabeth of Poland, herself the daughter of Elizabeth Arpad and Mieszko III King of Poland. Their daughter was Agnes of Brunswick, who was the mother of Rudolf I, Elector of the Palatinate of the Rhine, and Ludwig IV Holy Roman Emperor, who married Matilda, the daughter of Rudolf I of Habsburg. Ludwig’s daughter, Matilda of Wittelsbach, was the father of Frederick I Elector of Brandenburg. Frederick IV Elector of the Palatinate is also descended from Frederick I of Brandenburg’s sister, Margaret of Hohenzollern, who married Herman Margrave of Hessen. Frederick IV was the father of Frederick V, Elector of the Palatinate of the Rhine. The Protestant conspiracy around Frederick V went under the cover of the Rosicrucians. Ultimately, the Rosicrucians declared themselves to the world through the notorious Rosicrucian Manifestos. The first of the Rosicrucian manifestos was the Fama Frateritatis, appearing in 1614, part of a larger Protestant treatise titled, The Universal and General Reformation of the Whole Wide World, an allegorical history of the Rosicrucians, which was followed by a second tract a year later. The Manifestos purported to issue from a secret, “invisible” fraternity of “initiates” in Germany and France, and vehemently attacked the Catholic Church and the old Holy Roman Empire. The Rosicrucians derive their name from Christian Rosencreutz, who, according to the Manifestos, founded the order a century earlier. A poor descendent of nobility, he had been cloistered at an early age with a Jesuit order, before traveling to the Middle East to learn magic, alchemy and Kabbalah. Rosenkreuz is German for “rose cross”, referring both to the symbol of the Rosicrucians, which is a cross superimposed over the five-petaled rose of the Kabbalah. In the Rosicrucian Enlightenment, Frances Yates suggests that a component of the new Lurianic Kabbalah should be considered as figuring in the Manifestoes. Jacob Boehme, born in Bohemia in 1575, the man who came to articulate Lurianic Kabbalah for the Christian audiences of Europe, became active in around the same time, and likely influenced that trend among the Rosicrucians. Christian Rosenkreuz, the hero of the Rosicrucian tales, Yates claims, “describes in the Fama travels in the east whence he has returned with a new kind of Magia and Cabala which he incorporates into his own outlook.” 254 The Fama relates the life story of Christian Rosenkreuz, who supposedly founded the Rosy Cross brotherhood, as early as the 1300’s. Like Luria, Rosenkreuz was said to have traveled to Egypt, and upon his return to Europe, to have established a secret “House of the Holy Spirit”,"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"Rosicrucians and Freemasons 117 modeled on the Ismaili “House of Wisdom” in Cairo. 10 A further Rosicrucian tract appeared in 1616, titled the Chemical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreuz. The wedding refers to that important dynastic alliance, forged primarily through the efforts of John Dee, through the marriage of Frederick V Elector of the Palatinate, and Elizabeth Stuart, daughter of King James I of England. The Protestant conspirators had hoped that King James, who appeared to support the Protestant cause, would come to the assistance of his son-in-law Frederick, in the case of an uprising against the Catholic Church and its Habsburg supporters. In addition, in the Chemical Wedding, Christian Rosenkreuz is associated with an order of chivalry. This was in reference to the Order of the Garter. As Frances Yates has pointed out, as a necessary component of his future married to Elizabeth Stuart, Frederick V was invested with the Order of the Garter, a week before the wedding. Therefore, the “rose cross” of the Rosicrucians is derived from the dual symbolism of the Order of the Garter, being the Kabbalistic rose of the House of York, but also being the “red cross” of St. George, and ultimately of the Templars. 11 As the conspiracy began, Frederick V was offered the throne of Bohemia by rebellious Protestants, after which he moved to Prague with his family. This was seen as an intolerable affront to the Church, and thus precipitated the Thirty Years War. Frederick’s forces, however, were utterly routed outside of Prague. And, contrary to the hopes of the Rosicrucian movement, King James did not offer the assistance of England in support of his son-in-law, and the movement ended in complete ignominy. Within two years, Frederick and Elizabeth had been driven into exile in Holland, and Heidelberg was overrun by Catholic troops. The Freemasons Nevertheless, though the Rosicrucian conspiracy apparently ended in failure, its members merely regrouped, this time, in England, and under the name of the Freemasons. During the Thirty Years War, Johan Valentin Andrea, the author of the Rosicrucian Manifestos, created a network of secret societies known as the Christian Unions. According to Andrea’s directives, each society was headed by an anonymous prince, assisted by twelve others divided into groups of three, each of whom was to be a specialist in a given sphere of study. The purpose of these Unions was to preserve the occult Rosicrucian sciences from Church persecution. More importantly, the Christian Unions functioned as a refuge for the defeated Rosicrucians in England. There, these men, both English and European, formed the Invisible College, later the Royal Society. Virtually all of the Royal Society’s founding members were Freemasons. According to Masonic legend, though, Freemasonry dates back"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 118 to the guilds of Mediaeval masons, believed to have been Templars, who encrypted occult messages in the Gothic cathedrals, like Notre Dame in Paris. One of the earliest inductions into a Masonic lodge on record, however, was for Robert Boyle, in 1641. Boyle also had intimate relations with the Royal Society. Another initiate was Elias Ashmole, antiquarian who wrote The Institutions, Laws, and Ceremonies of the Most Noble Order of the Garter. Along with astrologer William Lilly, Ashmole founded a Rosicrucian lodge in London in 1646. This lodge was based on the utopian ideal of the creation of a New Atlantis, as expounded by Francis Bacon, the likely godfather of the Rosicrucian movement, which symbolized the golden age before Adam’s Fall, when humanity was spiritually perfect. The Freemasons were often suspected of being behind the English Civil War, though their position during the affair is unclear. In 1642, when King Charles I of England, the son of King James, tried to arrest five MPs for obstructive behavior, the English Civil War erupted, and Oliver Cromwell assumed command of the Parliamentary forces. Charles I was given the opportunity to escape, but was later recaptured, and finally, in 1649, was tried and beheaded. When Cromwell died in 1658, Charles II, the late king’s son, was invited back to rule as King of England. The “Restoration” of Charles II Stuart to the throne thus occurred in 1660, eleven years after the execution of his father. As John Robison notes, in Proofs of a Conspiracy, written in 1798, early Masonic ritual was shaped to promote the ideals of the sympathizers to the Stuart cause. He states: Nay the Ritual of the Master’s degree seems to have been formed, or perhaps twisted from its original institution, so as to give an opportunity of founding the political principles of the candidate, and of the whole Brethren present. For it bears so easy an adaptation to the death of the King [Charles I], to the overturning of the venerable constitution of the English government of three orders by a mean democracy, and its re-establishment by the efforts of the loyalists, that this would start into every person’s mind during the ceremonial, and could hardly fail to show, by the countenances and behaviour of the Brethren, how they were affected. 12 Freemasonry came to be more closely allied to the Stuart cause with the abdication of James II. When James II King of England, King Charles II’s brother and successor, issued a Declaration for Liberty of Conscience, to give protection to the followers of Catholicism, he was forced to leave the throne. The throne was then offered jointly to William of Orange and his wife Mary. William and Mary were cousins. Mary was the daughter of James II, while William was the son of James II’s sister Mary, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange-Nassau and William II von Nassau-Dillenburg, Prince of Orange, the grandson of William of Orange. 13 "},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"Rosicrucians and Freemasons 119 Though William and Mary were of Stuart lineage, the Scots were disappointed at the loss of a Stuart monarch, and in 1689, the year of James II’s deposition, Bonnie Dundee led a force of Highlanders against government troops at Killiecrankie. The rebellion was called a Jacobite Rising, because of their support of James II, which is derived from the Latin Jacomus, or Jacob in Hebrew. The emblem of the Jacobites, like that of the Rosicrucians, was the five-petaled White Rose of York. In March 1702, William died and the throne passed to Mary’s sister who became Queen Anne. The failure of either Anne or of her sister to produce an heir precipitated a succession crisis, for, in the absence of a Protestant heir, the Roman Catholic James II could attempt to return to the Throne. The Parliament of England then passed the Act of Settlement in 1701, whereupon the Electress Sophia of Hanover, the daughter of Frederick of the Palatinate and Elizabeth Stuart, was designated heir to the British throne, if William III and his sister-in-law, Anne, both died without issue. Sophia was the closest Protestant relative of the British Royal Family, though numerous Catholics with superior hereditary claims had to be bypassed. When Sophia died a few weeks before Anne, Sophia’s son George became the first Hanoverian King. Therefore, the supposed support of the Freemasons for the Stuarts, and their opposition to the Hanoverians, was merely staged to provide a pretext for the intallation, as King of England, the issue of the Chemycal Wedding of the Rosicrusians, the marriage of Frederick V and Elizabeth Stuart, united the divergent lines of the Stuarts and the House of Guelph. Freemasonry was supposed to be independent of political issues and problems. In practice, however, the Grand Lodge, which was established only three years after the coronation of William of Orange, supported the new German monarchy at a time when many Englishmen were strongly opposed to it. The Grand Lodge, had been created in 1717, and consisted at first of only one degree of initiation. Within five years of the Lodge’s founding, two additional degrees were added, when the system consisted of three steps: Entered Apprentice, Fellow Craft, and Master Mason. These degrees are commonly known as the “Blue Degrees”, the color blue being symbolically important in them, and have remained the first three degrees of nearly all Masonic systems since. The new Grand Lodge was reportedly very strict in its rule of forbidding political controversy within the lodges. The English Grand Lodge, however, was decidedly pro-Hanoverian, and its proscription against political controversy really amounted to a support of the Hanoverian status quo. During the ensuing generations, members of the Hanoverian royal family became Grand Masters. Augustus Frederick (1773-1843), the ninth son of George III, was Grand Master for the thirty years before his death. George’s father was the the son of George II, Frederick Loius Prince of England, who married Augusta of Saxen- Gotha-Altenburg, a descendant of Ferdinand of Habsburg, and through him from the bin Yahya family of Portugal. Prior to that, George’s older brother, who became King George IV, had held the Grand Master position. A later royal"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 120 Grand Master was King Edward VII, son of Queen Victoria. Edward served as Grand Master for 27 years while he was the Prince of Wales. The most recent royal Grand Master to become a king was the Duke of York, afterwards becoming King George VI, reigning from 1936 to 1952. Nevertheless, the Grand Lodge managed both sides of the controversy. While English Masonry, on the other hand, lost all trace of affection for the Stuarts, a new branch of Freemasonry was created to assist the Stuart cause, and patterned after the old Knights Templar. The man who reportedly founded Knights Templar Freemasonry was one of supporters of James III, successor to James II, Michael Ramsey, of the Royal Society. It was mainly in France, where the family had taken refuge, that Freemasonry became definitely affiliated with the cause of the Stuarts, who, it came to be believed, represented the “Grail” family, descended from the Templars of Scotland. An important figure of the Jacobite cause was Charles Radclyffe. In 1725, Radclyffe is said to have founded a lodge in Paris, the first such one outside of England, and was eventually acknowledged grand master of all French lodges. While English Freemasonry offered three degrees of initiation, that became universal throughout the order about 1730, Radclyffe appears to have been responsible for promulgating, if not in fact devising, Scottish Rite Freemasonry, which introduced higher degrees, and promised initiation into greater and more profound mysteries, supposedly preserved and handed down in Scotland. The Jacobite cause alleged that a Masonic lodge had been founded in Scotland, during the early eighteenth century, which drew its charter from a surviving Templar chapter in Bristol, but which had already been in operation for several hundred years. It was maintained that, during the Crusades, a small group of “Syrian Christians”. These were understood to be eastern mystics issuing from the Gnostic traditions that had been believed to have survived from the Essenes, found in Fatimid Egypt of the Ismailis, and deriving from the as the Sabians of Harran. They are known in Freemasonry as “Johannite Christians”, referring to the Mandeans belief in John the Baptist. They are said to have been rescued from the Muslims by the Templars, and eventually settled in Scotland, to found a new chapter of the Templar Order, which later merged with a lodge of Freemasonry. 14 James III Stuart adopted the Templar title, “Chevalier St. George.” His son, Charles Edward, “Bonnie Prince Charlie,” also known as the Young Pretender, was initiated into the Order of Knights Templar on September 24, 1745, the same year in which he led the next major Jacobite Rising, by invading Scotland. Charles was the son of James Francis Edward Stuart, known as the Old Pretender, himself the son of James II. The Bonnie Prince was symbolically crowned King Charles III by the clergy of Scotland’s Episcopal Church. Though, a year later, he was disastrously defeated at the Battle of Culloden Moor, and the Scots’ attempt to take London and install a Stuart king were foiled."},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"Rosicrucians and Freemasons 121 In Paris, in 1758, Jacobites participated in a Grand Council of Emperors of the East and West which organized a Rite of Perfection, consisting of twenty-five degrees, the highest being the Sublime Prince of the Royal Secret, that incorporated in its symbolism their political aspirations of a return of the House of Stuart to the thrones of England and Scotland. In 1762, Frederick the Great of Prussia, became the head of the Rite, drew up the constitutions of the “Antient and Accepted Scottish Rite”, and rearranged the degrees to bring their total to 33. 15 Frederick, who had been principally responsible for Prussia’s rise to power, was the great-grandson of Frederick V, Elector of the Palatinate of the Rhine, and Elizabeth Stuart.

Therefore, Freemasonry, which it too was forged from Lurianic Kabbalah, and founded in the Rosicrucian conspiracy that united the divergent heritage of the House of Guelph and the House of Stuart, was aligned, in the eighteenth century, with the most central development of this school, when it was infiltrated by the Illuminati. The goal of this organization was to fulfill the ancient dream of Plato, of establishing a New World Order, governed by an elite instructed in the occult. Therefore, the question of Jewish involvement or responsibility for the scheming of the Illuminati has since plagued investigators with accusations of anti-Semitism. However, Rabbi Marvin Antelman has recently resolved the issue by exposing that the Illuminati was operated by a fringe Gnostic group of Judaism, known as the Shabbateans, incepted by the false-messiah, Shabbetai Zevi. Despite the movement’s growing influence over the coming centuries, their malevolent designs were largely kept secret from the rest of the Jewish community, and were often inimical to it. And, this ignorance would continue to be fostered by the Illuminati, who would to barricade themselves behind these same accusations of anti-Semitism. According to Gershom Scholem, “...Lurianic Kabbalah became a dominant factor only about 1630-40 and the ideology of the Shabbatean movement was closely connected with this development.” 1 As Scholem explained, the Shabbatean movement was “the largest and most momentous messianic movement in Jewish History” since the destruction of Jerusalem. In 1666, Shabbetai Zevi, followed by his prophet, Nathan of Gaza, proclaimed himself the promised Messiah of Judaism. Zevi succeeded in rallying a large following, extending to nearly half of the Jewish population of the world at the time, including the Jews of Palestine, Egypt, and Eastern and Western Europe. The movement was shattered however, when, forced 13 : The Illuminati"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 124 by the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire to choose martyrdom or conversion, Zevi chose conversion to Islam. Nathan became a Roman Catholic, and the movement largely collapsed, though some followed Zevi into conversion, and there is, down to the present time, an Islamic sect in Turkey that follows his teachings, known as the “Doenmeh” , who profess Islam outwardly, while adhering to a mixture of traditional and heretical Judaism in secret. The Shabbatean heresy, which for some time survived in secret circles akin to something of a Masonic organization, eventually reasserted itself through the sect known as the Frankists. 2 They were also known as the Zoharists, or the Illuminated, or, in Podolia, from where they originated, as Shabbatean Zevists. The leader of the Zoharists was Jacob Frank, originally named Jacob Leibowicz, who regarded himself as a reincarnation of Zevi. Reviving the vilest Gnostic traditions of the Kabbalah, the Frankists were bent not only on the eradication and humiliation of the majority of the Jewish community who refused to accept their deviations, and therefore of Judaism as a whole, but of all religions, and exploited the Zionist ideals to disguise their quest for world domination. The Frankists believed that in the Messianic age, the laws of the Torah were no longer valid, and all that had been formerly prohibited was now permitted, or even mandatory. This included all the prohibited sexual unions and incest. Therefore, their practices, which included orgiastic, sexually promiscuous rites, led the Jewish community to brand them as heretics. Frank preached a “Religious Myth of Nihilism”. Ultimately, Frank taught his followers that the overthrow and destruction of society was the only thing that could save mankind. Despite the fact that they were all outwardly religious, the Frankists sought “the annihilation of every religion and positive system of belief,” and they dreamed “of a general revolution that would sweep away the past in a single stroke so that the world might be rebuilt.” Of the revolutionary philosophy of the Frankists, Gershom Scholem wrote in Kabbalah and Its Symbolism: “for Frank, anarchic destruction represented all the Luciferian radiance, all the positive tones and overtones, of the word Life.” 3 Jacob Frank promulgated his nihilistic religion as “the way to Esau” or “Edom”. According to Frank, all the great patriarchs had sought the way to God, but without success. It was therefore necessary to find a new way, which leads to “true life”, which Esau or Edom symbolize as liberation, or man’s nature unbridled by law. In order to achieve this goal, it would be necessary to abolish all laws, but to be accomplished in secret. As the “true believers” had already passed through Judaism and Islam, they ought now also to assume the “religion of Edom”, or Christianity, outwardly, using it to conceal the real core of their belief of Jacob Frank as the true Messiah and the living God. In 1759, members of the sect converted to Christianity, but nevertheless persisted in heretical ways. As a result, the Inquisition imprisoned Frank in 1760.

In the period between Frank’s conversion to his death, the community of his followers strengthened their position not only in Poland, but also in the Austrian territories of Moravia and Bohemia. The movement became active in Masonic organizations and began to combine revolutionary Kabbalistic ideas with the philosophical ideals of the Enlightenment. Among Frank’s followers, according to Scholem, some were accepted into the administration and aristocracy of the Habsburgs, “but they preserved a few Frankist traditions and customs, so that a stratum was created in which the boundaries between Judaism and Christianity became blurred, irrespective of whether the members had converted or retained their links with Judaism.” 4 Many Frankist families kept a miniature of Frank’s daughter Eva, who assumed leadership after him, to be sent to the most prominent households. As describes Gershom Scholem: The sect’s exclusive organization continued to survive in this period through agents who went from place to place, through secret gatherings and separate religious rites, and through dissemination of a specifically Frankist literature. The “believers” endeavored to marry only among themselves, and a wide network of inter-family relationships was created among the Frankists, even among those who had remained within the Jewish fold. Later Frankism was to a large extent the religion of families who had given their children the appropriate education. The Frankists of Germany, Bohemia, and Moravia usually held secret gatherings in Carlsbad in summer round about the ninth of Av. 5 The ninth of the month of Av was not only the supposed date of birth of Shabbetai Zevi, but is also known in Judaism as Tisha B’av. In Judaism, Tisha B’Av is the darkest day on the Jewish calendar, commemorating the destruction of the Temple of Jerusalem, first by the Babylonians, and secondly by the Romans. Also, the ninth of Av, 1492, was the day the Jews were expelled from Spain. The day is observed by Jews as a day of fasting and prayer. However, the Frankists celebrated the day with revel and orgies. The Illuminati The Jesuits, the precursors of the organization, continued to be the source of much intrigue, and were responsible for the formation of their predecessors, the Illuminati. John Robison, in Proofs of a Conspiracy, written in 1798, which exposed the devious evolution of the Illuminati, remarked of German Freemasonry, “I saw it much connected with many occurrences and schisms in the Christian church; I saw that the Jesuits had several times interfered in it; and that most of the exceptionable innovations and dissentions had arisen about the time that the order of Loyola was suppressed; so that it should seem, that these intriguing brethren had attempted to maintain their influence by"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 126 the help of Free Masonry.” 6 Therefore, when Pope Clement XIV dissolved the Jesuits in 1773, Adam Weishaupt, referred to as “a Jesuit in disguise” by his closest associate, Baron von Knigge, established the Illuminati as a secret order modeled on them. 7 According to Rabbi Marvin S. Antelman, in To Eliminate the Opiate, it was the founder of the Rothschild dynasty who convinced Weishaupt to accept the Frankist doctrine, and who afterwards financed the Illuminati. 8 A Jewish goldsmith, born Amschel Moses Bauer, who decided to settle in Frankfurt. He opened a Counting House, and over the door placed his sign, a red shield, featuring a “Star of David”. The shied is the same flag granted to the Prague Jews by Charles IV, and is in accordance with the Frankist doctrine of Edom or Esau, and the red banner of the Khazars, or Red Jews. As “red shield” in German is “Rot Schild”, Bauer’s son, Amschel Mayer Bauer, took on the name Rothschild. It is Rothschild who said, “give me control of a nation’s money, and I care not who makes her laws.” Rothschild’s wealth was largely achieved through his association with the family of Hesse-Kassel. Rothschild served a three year apprenticeship in Hanover at the Bank of Oppenheim, at the service to Lt. Gen. Baron von Estorff, who was the principal adviser to Landgrave Frederick II of Hesse-Kassel. Frederick II was a member of the Order of the Garter, as well as the wealthiest man in Europe, much of it inherited from his father, Wilhelm VIII, brother of the King of Sweden. The House of Hesse is descended from Philip I the “Magnanimous” Landgrave of Hesse, who was a leading champion of the Protestant Reformation. In the early Middle Ages, Hesse was a part of Thuringia, but in the War of the Thuringian Succession, in the thirteenth century, Hesse gained its independence and became an Earldom within the Holy Roman Empire. The state existed until the death of Philip in 1567. Philip was a descendant of Margaret, the sister of Frederick I Margrave of Brandenburg, who had married Hermann Landgrave of Hessen. Philip married Chistine of Saxony, whose mother was Barbara of Jagellon, a great-granddaughter of Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund. Despite Philip’s intentions, Hessen was split among his four sons, but the only two to states to survive were Hessen-Kassel and Hessen-Darmstadt. Philip’s daughter, Elizabeth, married Ludwig VI Elector of the Palatinate of the Rhine, grandfather of Frederick V. Frederick II of Hessen-Kassel was the great-grandson of Elizabeth Charlotte, the sister of Frederick V of the Palatinate. Elizabeth Charlotte was also the grandmother to Frederick I King of Prussia. Frederick II of Hessen-Kassel was a direct descendant of “Maurice the Learned” of Hesse-Kassel, uncle to Frederick IV of the Palatine. Maurice had procured the services of prominent Rosicrucians and alchemists, like Michael Maier, while the town of Kassel itself, according to Francis Yates, was where the Rosicrucian Manifestos were first published. Frederick II of Hessen-Kassel married Maria Princess of Hanover, cousin of Frederick II the Great King of Prussia, and the daughter of George II King of England."},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"The Illuminati 127 Baron von Estorff advised the Landgrave that Mayer Amschel showed an exceptional ability to increase wealth through his investments. Mayer Amschel arranged to hire 16,800 Hessian soldiers to assist the nephew of Federick’s wife, King George III of England, in suppressing the American Rebellion. When Frederick II of Hessen-Kassel died in 1785, Rothschild obtained total influence over his successor, Karl’s brother Elector Wilhelm IX, who he managed to make one of the wealthiest monarchs of his time. In 1773, Mayer Rothschild had invited twelve other wealthy and influential men, to convince them to pool their resources in a plot to bring about a new world order. Thus was Adam Weishaupt commissioned to establish the Illuminati. Though born Jewish, as a young boy, Weishaupt was educated by the Jesuits. On May 1, 1776, three years after the Jesuit order was disbanded by the Church, Weishaupt announced the foundation of the Order of Perfectibilists, which later became more widely known as the Illuminati. The Illuminati is the one instance in modern history where we have verifiable evidence of a large-scale conspiracy. Weishaupt dreamed of a utopian superstate with the abolition of private property, social authority and nationality. In this Gnostic state, human beings would live in “harmony” within a universal brotherhood, based on free love, peace, spiritual wisdom and equality. Weishaupt’s principal targets for reform were the monarchy, the Church and the aristocracy. The doctrines of the Illuminati, according to Albert Pike, a 33 rd degree Scottish Rite Mason, were, like their predecessors, the Templars, Rosicrucians, and Freemasons, the ancient tradition of the Kabbalah: The Occult Science of the Ancient Magi was concealed under the shadows of the Ancient Mysteries: it was imperfectly revealed or rather disfigured by the Gnostics: it is guessed at under the obscurities that cover the pretended crimes of the Templars; and it is found enveloped in enigmas that seem impenetrable, in the Rites of the Highest Masonry. Magism was the Science of Abraham and Orpheus, of Confucius and Zoroaster. It was the dogmas of this Science that were engraven on the tables of stone by Enoch and Trismegistus. Moses purified and re-veiled them, for that is the meaning of the word reveal. He covered them with a new veil, when he made of the Holy Kabbalah the exclusive heritage of the people of Israel, and the inviolable Secret of its priests. The Mysteries of Thebes and Eleusis preserved among the nations some symbols of it, already altered, and the mysterious key whereof was lost among the instruments of an ever- growing superstition. Jerusalem, the murderess of her prophets, and so often prostituted to the false gods of the Syrians and Babylonians, had at length in its turn lost the Holy Word, when a Prophet announced by the Magi by the consecrated Star of Initiation [Sirius], came to rend asunder the worn veil of the old Temple, in order to give the Church a new tissue of legends and symbols, that still and ever conceal from the Profane, and ever preserves to the Elect the same truths. 9"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 128 Weishaupt’s poor diplomatic skills prevented him from successfully preaching for the order, until he recruited Freiherr von Knigge, a man well known in Masonic circles. By the great international convention of Freemasons held at Wilhelmsbad, in 1782, the “Illuminated Freemasonry”, which Knigge and Weishaupt now proclaimed the to be the only “pure” Freemasonry, had already gained such a reputation that almost all the members of the convention sought admission to it. A number of the most prominent representatives of Freemasonry and “enlightenment” became Illuminati, including, in 1783, Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick, the foremost leader of European Freemasonry. Ferdinand was the great-grandson of George I of England, and married Augusta, a sister of George III. Other famous members were Goethe, Herder and Nicolai. Within a short time the Illuminati had lodges all over Germany and Austria, while branches were founded in Italy, Hungary, France, and Switzerland. However, it was the Illuminati plot to overthrow the Hapsburgs in 1784, exposed by police spies who had infiltrated the order, which led to the Bavarian government banning all secret societies, and driving the followers of Weishaupt underground. Nevertheless, suspicion remained that its members might still be working in secret, spreading subversive ideas, and scheming behind the scenes. 10 Prior to the French Revolution, Weishaupt is to have said, “Salvation does not lie where strong thrones are defended by swords, where the smoke of censers ascends to heaven or where thousands of strong men pace the rich fields of harvest. The revolution which is about to break will be sterile if it is not complete.” 11 The Asiatic Brethren Though the Illuminati was essentially disbanded, the Frankists would continue to exercise a formative influence in the development of Freemasonry and related secret societies. Primarily, they would be responsible for the evolution of fringe Freemasonry, which would attempt to revive the lost Gnostic tradition of Egypt. This agenda would divide the occult community into two centers of activity, one in Europe, and the other in Egypt. It was from these two centers that there evolved the most important transformations in the development of modern secret societies, as well as similar societies in the Middle East, comprised of impostors posing as Islamic fundamentalists, with which they would conspire to foment the Clash of Civilizations. Jacob Frank’s nephew and successor was Moses Dobruschka, who converted to Christianity, and entered the Habsburg nobility with the name of Franz Thomas von Schoenfeld. As Franz, he entered into Austrian Freemasonry, and became involved with Ecker von Eckhoffen. During the early 1780s, Eckhoffen became disgruntled with an order known as the Gold and Rosy Cross of 1777, and, with Dobruschka and members of the Habsburg nobility, formed what became known as the Asiatic Brethren. 12"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"The Illuminati 129 The basis of the Asiatic Brethren, also known as the Fratres Lucis, or the Brotherhood of Light, was the Rosicrucianism, Martinism and the Illuminati. The order, comprised chiefly of Jews, Turks, Persians, and Armenians, purportedly represented a survival of the same “Syrian Christians” rescued by the Templars, that is, the Sabians, or their successors, the Ismailis of Egypt. The full title of the organization was The Knights and Brethren of St. John the Evangelist. The Grand Master of the Asiatic Brethren, and leading member of the Illuminati, was Prince Karl, the brother of Wilhelm I of Hessen-Kassel. 13 Both were the sons of Frederick II of Hessen-Kassel, from his wife, Mary of Hanover, Princess of Great Britain, daughter of George II King of England, and therefore cousin to Frederick II the Great of Prussia, and of Augusta, the wife of Ferdinand Duke of Brunswick. Karl married his first cousin, Louise, Princess of Denmark, of the Oldenberg dynasty that produced the Kings of Denmark, Norway, Greece, and the later Romanovs, Emperors of Russia. According to legend, the Oldenbergs are descended from Elgimar, a brother of Godfroi of Bouillon, from the Swan Knight and whose mother was Karl’s mother’s sister, Louise of Hanover, Princess of England. 14 Another member of the Asiatic Brethren was the Comte de St. Germain a notorious charlatan and alchemist, whom many believed to be immortal. He continues to be regarded among occultists as perhaps the leading figure of their modern history. As such, he is believed to have many magical powers such as the ability to teleport, levitate, walk through walls, influence people telepathically, etc. He is described as one of the later incarnations of Christian Rosenkreuz. Theosophists consider him to be an Ascended Master, those beings who have been secretly guiding the history of humanity. His title is said to be the “Lord of Civilization”. Some esoteric groups credit him with inspiring the Founding Fathers to draft the Declaration of Independence and the United States Constitution, as well as providing the design of the Great Seal of the United States. In his time, St. Germain was the supposed Grand Master of Freemasonry, and had become an acquaintance of Louis XV King of France and his mistress Madame de Pompadour. St. Germain was a permanent houseguest of Karl’s, who called him “the greatest philosopher who ever lived,” and nicknamed him “Papa”. 15 St. Germain was in St Petersburg, where he participated in a conspiracy when the Russian army assisted Catherine the Great in usurping the throne from her husband Peter III of Russia. Catherine was a German princess with a very remote Russian ancestry. She was from the House of Anhalt Zerbst, formed in the twelfth century, from the son of Albert I Margrave of Brandenburg, Bernard III Duke of Saxony, who married Judith of Poland, the daughter of Mieszko III, and Elizabeth Arpad, granddaughter Geza Arpad and of Vladimir I of Kiev. Catherine the Great is remembered as one of the “Enlightened Monarchs”, because she implemented several political and cultural reforms on behalf of the Illuminati. Voltaire, with whom she maintained regular"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 130 correspondence, called her “Semiramis of Russia”, in reference to the ancient Babylonian queen, on whom the worship of the goddess Astarte was based. Catherine was succeeded by her son Csar Paul I. In her memoirs, she strongly implies that his father was not her husband, the Grand Duke Peter, later Emperor, but her lover Sergei Saltykoff. 16 One of many aliases, Saltykoff was the name the Count St. Germain assumed when he served as a Russian General while they were fighting the Turks. 17 Their son, Csar Paul I, was also a Mason, as well as Grand Master of the Knights of Malta. 18 Leading Illuminati like Pasquales, Saint-Martin and Swedenborg were all members of the Asiatic Brethren. 19 Following the order’s demise, the title of Illuminati was given to the Martinists, founded by Saint-Martin. The origin of the Ordre Martiniste et Synarchique is found in French mystic, Martinez Pasquales, born in 1727. He organized a movement which he named the Ordre des Chevalier Maçons Elus-Coën de L’Univers, or “Order of the Knight Masons, Elected Priests of the Universe”, though his work was carried on by his pupil, Louis-Claude de Saint-Martin, who later founded the order known as the Martinists, or the French Illuminés. In 1771, an amalgamation of all the Masonic groups was effected at the new lodge of the Amis Réunis. A further development of the Amis Réunis was the Rite of the Philalethes, formed by Savalette de Langes in 1773, out of Swedenborgian, Martinist, and Rosicrucian mysteries. Emmanuel Swedenborg became interested in the teachings of Dr. Samuel Jacob Falk, known as the “Baal Shem” of London, who was reputed to exercise miraculous powers through his supposed mastery of the magical names of God. Falk was a crypto-Shabbatean, who collaborated with a network of fellow Frankists in England, Holland, Poland, and Germany. 20 Nesta Webster, in Secret Societies and Subversive Movements, explained, “Falk indeed was far more than a Mason, he was a high initiate – the supreme oracle to which the secret socieites applied for guidance.” Finally, according to Savallete de Langes, “some people believe him to be the Chief of all the Jews and attribute to purely political schemes all that is marvelous and singular in his life and conduct.” 21 Webster also suggests that Falk would have been the source for the “Egyptian Rite” Count Cagliostro created in London. Cagliostro, whose original name is thought to have been Giuseppe Balsamo, was a magician and charlatan who enjoyed enormous success in Parisian high society, in the years preceding the French Revolution. According to his own fraudulent account, however, he was born an orphan on the Island of Malta. His earliest memories, he claimed, are of the holy city of Medina in Arabia, where he was called “Acharat”, and where he lived in the palace of the Mufti Salahaym. Four persons were attached to his service, the chief of whom was an Eastern Adept named Althotas, who instructed him in the various sciences and made him proficient in several Oriental languages. Though both teacher and pupil conformed outwardly to the religion of Islam, Cagliostro later wrote, “the true religion was imprinted in our hearts.” 22"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"The Illuminati 131 Historians, however, believe Balsamo was the son of poor parents, and grew up as an urchin in the streets of Palermo. Escaping from Sicily after a series of minor crimes, he traveled through Greece, Egypt, Persia, Arabia, and Rhodes and apparently studied alchemy. He eventually assumed the title of count, and in 1768 married the Roman beauty Lorenza Feliciani, called Serafina. He traveled all the major European cities, selling elixirs of youth and potions, and posing as an alchemist, soothsayer, medium, and miracle healer. His séances had become popular in fashionable society in Paris by 1785. According to his own admission, Cagliostro’s mission “was to work so as to turn Freemasonry in the direction of Weishaupt’s projects”. 23 Louis Blanc, in his History of the French Revolution, 1848, reported that Cagliostro was initiated into the Illuminati at Frankfort, 1781, under the authority of “the Grand Masters of the Templars”. From them he received instructions and funds to carry out their diabolical intrigues, through the famous “affair of the necklace” against Marie Antoinette, in preparation for their eventual seizure of power. As a consequence, he spent nine months in the Bastille prison, until he was finally banished from France. In 1789 he was arrested in Rome after his wife had denounced him to the Inquisition as a heretic, magician, conjuror, and Freemason. He was finally tried and sentenced to death, but his sentence was later commuted to life imprisonment in the fortress of San Leo in the Apennines, where he eventually died. The French Revolution Despite the ban, the Illuminati proceeded with their plot for revolution in France. The chief conduit of their activities was the Loge des Chevaliers Bienfaisants at Lyons. This Lodge stood at the head of French Freemasonry, and is where the fictitious Order of Masonic Knights Templars was formed. Its Grand Master was Illuminati member, the Duke of Orleans. He was merely Lieutenant to Frederick the Great, the Grand Master of all Freemasonry, though both shared Stuart lineage. The Duke’s great-grandfather was Philippe II, son of Philip I and Elizabeth-Charlotte, grand-daughter of Frederick, Elector of the Palatinate of the Rhine, and Elizabeth, daughter of King James I of England. Thus, the Duke of Orleans’ primary motivation, besides his hatred of the King and his wife, Marie Antoinette, was to himself succeed as King following the sought revolution. About eight years before the Revolution, Orleans was elected Grand Master of France, and the whole association of various lodges came to be known as the Grand Orient. The chief instigators of the Revolution, Mirabeau, Condorcet, Rochefoucault and others, were high-ranking officers of these lodges. The Count Mirabeau was himself a member of the Illuminati, and had attended the Grand Masonic Convention in 1782, at Wilhelmsbad, in Hessen-Kassell, where the ground-plan for the coming revolution was reputed"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 132 to have originally been discussed. In 1788, deputies of the Illuminati were sent, upon his request, to inform the French lodges on strategy. Their first item of advice was the creation of a Political Committee in every lodge, and from these committees arose the Jacobins Club. Soon, nearly every lodge in the Grand Orient was infiltrated by supporters of Weishaupt, who became active in spreading the political policies of terrorism against the state. All the leading philosophers of the Enlightenment were Freemasons, or members of the Illuminati, and assisted in propagating its goals. To ensnare the masses, the Illuminati exploited the Gnostic ideal of “liberty”. In order to present the struggle for “liberty” in context, the Illuminati constructed the myth of progress, as history evolving from superstition to “freedom” from despotism, in this case, meaning the Catholic Church. This myth of progress was actually an adaptation of Lurianic Kabbalah, and disguised the ultimate Illuminati goal of supplanting the world’s religions, and incepting an occult New World Order, to be governed by their messiah. According to Illuminati member, Marie Jean Caritat, Marquis de Condorcet, who wrote, Outline of a Historical Picture of the Progress of the Human Mind, history progresses through nine stages, with a tenth, still ahead, when man will enjoy freedom, equality, and justice. The first of these epochs, is that of mankind living in kinship organization, with the simplest possible economy and the beginnings of religion. The eight succeeding epochs develop through the origins of language, craft, pastoralism, villages, towns, commerce, and reaching the heights of ancient classical civilization. Next was the “barbarism” of Christian society, succeeded by the Renaissance, the rise of modern science, with the ninth epoch culminating in the success of the project of the Enlightenment. For Condorcet, “everything points to the fact that we are verging upon the epoch of one of the great revolutions of the human race . . . The existing state of knowledge guarantees that it will be auspicious.” The tenth epoch still in the future, will represent man’s final achievement of full equality, liberty, justice, and abolition of not merely poverty and hunger, but of all remaining impediments upon the human mind. Likewise, in The Education of the Human Race, Illuminati member, Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, incorporated Enlightenment ideas of human advancement. Lessing is most famous for his Nathan the Wise, in reference to “crypto-Shabbatean”, Rabbi Falk of London. Much more substantial and systematic was the work of Johann Gottfried Herder, also of the Illuminati, and the leading figure behind the rise of the German nationalism of the Romantic period. In Outlines of a Philosophy of History of Man, Herder presents mankind in a ceaseless process of evolution: commencing with the beginnings of the human race, proceeding, stage by stage, and reaching the level of civilization which was German at its best, but including the rest of the West as well. The final German Enlightenment philosopher of note was Immanuel Kant, who was influenced by Emmanual Swedenborg. Kant wrote the Idea of a Universal History from a Cosmopolitical Point of View, in which the"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"The Illuminati 133 progress of mankind is made central. Some of his propositions clearly outline the Illuminati agenda: ...The history of the human race, viewed as a whole, may be regarded as the realization of a hidden plan of nature to bring about a political constitution, internally, and, for this purpose, also externally perfect, as the only state in which all the capacities implanted by her in mankind can be fully developed. 24 Through these methods of indoctrination, the French successfully riled into toppling their government, opening the way for the Illuminati’s deceptive seizure of power. In 1789, when the Bastille was stormed, the Comte de Mirabeau, allegedly said, “the idolatry of the monarchy has received a death blow from the sons and daughters of the Order of the Templars.” 25 Albert Pike declared that, “the secret movers of the French Revolution had sworn to overthrow the Throne and the Altar upon the Tomb of Jacques de Molay.” 26 The revolutionaries, many of whom were members of Masonic organizations, adopted the symbolism and language of the occult societies. The Masonic tenets of Equality, Liberty and Fraternity, became their rallying cry. When Louis XIV, King of France was executed, a voice in the crowd cried out “De Molay is avenged!” The American Revolution Just prior to the French Revolution, the Illuminati had been conspiring to bring about the American Revolution of 1776. Finally, among the fifty-six American rebels who signed the Declaration of Independence, only six were not Masons. The American constitution itself was inspired by the French Revolution, and the ideals of Freemasonry. It enshrined “Liberty”, meaning freedom from the yoke of Christian morality, rules which it attempted to replace with “unalienable rights”, a concept originally discussed among the secret meetings of the Illuminati. Both Washington and Jefferson, founder of the Democratic Party, were the leading descendants of Alain IV de Bretagne, the Fisher King, and therefore, descendants of Joseph of Arimathea and the “Sea god”. 27 Also, both Washington and Jefferson were ardent defenders of Adam Weishaupt, while Jefferson even referred to him as an “an enthusiastic philanthropist”. George Washington wrote instead that he did not deny “the Doctrines of the Illuminati, and principles of Jacobinism had not spread in the United States.” “On the contrary”, he replied “no one is more truly satisfied of this fact than I am.” He continued: The idea that I meant to convey, was, that I did not believe that the Lodges of Free Masons in this Country had, as Societies, endeavored to propagate the diabolical tenets of the first, or pernicious principles of the latter (if they are susceptible of separation).

Jefferson defended Weishaupt saying: As Weishaupt lived under the tyranny of a despot and priests, he knew that caution was necessary even in spreading information, and the principles of pure morality. This has given an air of mystery to his views, was the foundation of his banishment.... If Weishaupt had written here, where no secrecy is necessary in our endeavors to render men wise and virtuous, he would not have thought of any secret machinery for that purpose. 29 In September 18, 1793, President George Washington dedicated the United States Capitol. Dressed in Masonic apron, the president placed a silver plate on the cornerstone and covered it with the Masonic symbols of corn, oil and wine. The plan of the city of Washington DC itself was designed by Freemason and architect Pierre Charles L’Enfante in the form of a pentagram, or five-pointed star. In 1848, in a Masonic ceremony, the cornerstone was laid of the Washington Monument, an obelisk or pillar, like those formerly dedicated to the dying gods of ancient Middle East. And, every president of the United States since Independence has purportedly been a 33rd degree Freemason."},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"135 1848: The Year of Revolutions The continuing intrigues of the Illuminati culminated in the several political upheavals of 1848, known as the Year of Revolutions. This year was the fruition of the machinations of Egyptian Rite Freemasonry, a derivation developed through the influence of the Asiatic Brethren. It was out of these associations that would develop the most pernicious occult organizations through the rest of the century, known as the Occult Revival, and into the twentieth, when they would eventually ally themselves with related secret societies in Egypt, who purportedly represented a survival of the Ismaili “Grand Lodge” of Fatimid times, to produce Islamic fundamentalism. It was Cagliostro who had been responsible for the mystical teachings incorporated into the Masonic Rite of Mizraim, the Biblical name of Egypt, based purportedly on the secret teachings he learned on his travels to that country. The army of Napoleon, composed of members of the Philalethes, Asiatic Brothers, and Martinists, brought Cagliostro’s Masons to Egypt, where they supposedly came in contact with a native esoteric fraternity, representing the Grand Lodge established by the Ismailis in the eleventh century, and known in the occult as the Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor. In 1798, a Grand Lodge of Freemasonry was established at Cairo, when Napoleon and his general Kleber received investiture with a ring at the great Pyramid of Cheops, at the hands of an “Egyptian Sage”, as a symbol of their union with the “ancient occult Masonry of Egypt”. Mohammed Ali Pasha, then ruler over Egypt, had also supposedly been a patron of Freemasonry until his death, while the Egyptian lodges maintained correspondences with their confreres in Europe. 1 Samuel Honis, a native Egyptian, was supposedly initiated at the Grand Lodge of Cairo, by the enigmatic Comte St. Germain. St. Germain was also reputedly the Grand Master of Freemasonry, and initiated Cagliostro into the mysteries of Egyptian Freemasonry. 2 Afterwards, Samuel Honis brought the Egyptian Rite of Freemasonry to France, and in 1815, a lodge, Les Disciples 14 : The Palladian Rite"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 136 de Memphis, was founded by Honis, Marconis de Negre and others. In 1816, this lodge was closed, and Honis and Marconis de Negre disappeared from the scene. However, in Paris in 1838, the latter’s son, Jacques-Etienne Marconis de Negre, commonly known as Marconis, ignorantly called “the Negro” because of his Egyptian features, established the Memphis Rite, as a variation of Cagliostro’s Rite of Mizraim, but failed to attract much of a following. Having gone underground for some time, the Egyptian Rite of Freemasonry, known as the Antient and Primitive Rite, was eventually revived, and along with a great number of Frankists who had joined the ranks, participated in a spree of subversive movements, beginning in 1848. 3 Among them was Karl Marx, who in 1845 moved to Brussels, and with Friedrich Engels reorganized the Communist League. The Communist League was formerly known as the League of the Just, an off-shoot of the Parisian Outlaws League, itself evolved from the revolutionary French Jacobins, originally founded by the Illuminati. In 1848, Marx published the Communist Manifesto, borrowing heavily from Clinton Roosevelt’s, The Science of Government Founded on Natural Law, that echoed the philosophies of Weishaupt. Engels described their goals as “the same as those of the other Parisian secret societies of the period.” 4 According to Rabbi Antelman, in To Eliminate the Opiate, Marx was a Shabbatean, his father Heinrich having been inducted into the sect. 5 Paul Johnson, in the History of the Jews, pointed out that Marx’s theory of history resembles the Kabbalistic theories of the Messianic Age of Shabbatai Zevi’s mentor, Nathan of Gaza. 6 Marx’s philosophy of history was derived from Lurianic Kabbalah, through the influence of Hegel. Like Hegel, Marx believed that the world develops according to a dialectical formula, but he totally disagrees with Hegel as to the motive force of this development. Hegel believed in a mystical entity called Spirit. For Marx, it is matter, not spirit. Scarcely was the Manifesto published, when a wave of revolutions broke out in Europe. The first started in France, led by Freemason of the Rite of Memphis, Louis Blanc. King Louis Philippe was overthrown and Louis Blanc’s revolution established the second republic. The revolution in France gave the impetus to similar ideas in other countries of Europe, which in turn started other revolutions. The February revolution in France also gave the German states the idea to make a proposal for a unified German country with a national parliament. But the old order was restored because the provisional government couldn’t decide on a constitution for the new government. Italy, which at the time, like Germany, was but a hodge-podge of states also saw a revolution in the same year which made Pope Pius IX flee. This gave a leader of unification, Giuseppe Mazzini the chance to unify Italy. This plot of Mazzini, however was a failure because of the Italians’ overwhelming protectiveness of their independence. Mazzini had been appointed head of the Illuminati in 1834, after Weishaupt died in 1830. Mazzini had become a member of a revolutionary"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"The Palladian Rite 137 secret society by the name of the Carbonari, which provided the main source of opposition to the conservative regimes imposed on by the victorious allies after the defeat of Napoleon in 1815. Their influence prepared the way for the Risorgimento movement. Meaning “Rising Again”, the Risorgimento was a movement for Italian unification that culminated in the establishment of the Kingdom of Italy in 1861 . Also, in 1860, Mazzini had founded the Mafia. The Palladian Rite The relationship established between the European occultists and their brethren in Egypt opened the opportunity to devise the great Illuminati plot to take place in the twentieth century: three world wars, the last of which would be against Islam. The plan was devised by the four leading member of what is known as the Palladian Rite. In 1870, Mazzini, Lord Henry Palmerston of England, Otto von Bismarck of Germany and Albert Pike, all thirty third degree Scottish Rite Masons, completed an agreement to create a supreme universal rite of Masonry, that would arch over all the other rites, even the different national rites. It centralised all high Masonic bodies in the world under one head. To this end the Palladium Rite was created as the pinnacle of the pyramid of power: an international alliance to bring in the Grand Lodges, the Grand Orient, the ninety- seven degrees of Memphis and Mizraim of Cagliostro, also known as the Ancient and Primitive Rite, and the Scottish Rite, or the Ancient and Accepted Rite. 7 Lord Palmerston, the Grand Patriarch or Master of Grand Orient Freemasonry, as well as knight of the Order of the Garter, was Queen Victoria’s Foreign Secretary. Palmerston was also Prime Minister during the Britain’s Opium Wars against China, in 1840 and 1858, beginning a policy of narcotics exploitation that would later characterize the Illuminati’s strategy in the twentieth century. Opium was first exploited by the Portuguese in the sixteenth century, followed by the Dutch, before attracting the British. Starting in 1773, the British East India Company established a monopoly on the production of Indian opium, transporting it to China, and bartering it for silk, tea and porcelain. 8 The drug trade soared, and by 1830, opium was the largest commodity in world trade. In China, local criminal gangs, known as Triads, were selected by the British trading companies to distribute their opium. 9 When the Chinese rulers acted to stop the supply of opium, the British used their military and naval might to defeat them. The peace treaty that then followed gave the British a guaranteed right to increase the flow of opium, to be paid as compensation for the opium the Chinese rulers had confiscated, and to exercise sovereignty over strategic ports and offshore islands. This is how Hong Kong came under British rule. Hong Kong has since been used as a center for Far East drug trafficking, run by the Triads crime syndicate, who continue to operate within the Illuminati today. Britain’s official policy was outlined by Lord Palmerston:"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 138 ...we must unreminttingly endeavor to find, in other parts of the world, new vents for our industry [opium]...

Thirty-third degree Mason, Otto von Bismark, was one of the most prominent leaders of the nineteenth century. Appointed to represent Prussia in Frankfurt, Bismarck slowly became convinced that a Prussian-led unified German nation was an important goal. As Prime Minister of Prussia, through a series of successful wars, he unified the numerous states of the German confederation, created by the Congress of Vienna, into a nation-state, except Austria, Luxembourg, Netherlands, and Liechtenstein. In 1871, Wilhelm I of Prussia was proclaimed German emperor, and the Second German Reich, to succeed the First Reich, the Holy Roman Empire, was born. Bismarck became the first Chancellor of the German Empire. Pike was born in 1809, in Boston, studied at Harvard, then later served as a Brigadier-General in the Confederate Army. After the Civil War, he was found guilty of treason and jailed. He was pardoned by fellow Freemason President Andrew Johnson in 1866, with whom he met at the White House the very next day. The only monument to a Confederate general in Washington, D.C. was erected in Pike’s honor. Pike was one of the founding fathers, and head of the Ancient Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry, being the Grand Commander of North American Freemasonry from 1859-1891. In 1869, he was a top leader in the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, and in 1871 wrote the Masonic handbook, the Morals and Dogma of the Ancient and Accepted Rite of Freemasonry. In addition to a Supreme Council located in Charleston, South Carolina, Pike established Supreme Councils in Rome, Italy, led by Mazzini; London, England, led by Palmerston; and Berlin, Germany, led by Bismarck. He set up 23 subordinate councils in strategic places throughout the world, including five Grand Central Directories in Washington, DC (North America), Montevideo (South America), Naples (Europe), Calcutta (Asia), and Mauritius (Africa), which were used to gather information. These branches have been the secret headquarters for the Illuminati’s activities ever since. 11 In a letter that he wrote to Mazzini, dated August 15, 1871, Pike graphically outlined plans for three world wars, that were seen as necessary to bring about the One World Order. For a short time, this letter was on display in the British Museum Library in London, and was copied by William Guy Carr, former Intelligence Officer in the Royal Canadian Navy, and author of Pawns in the Game. Carr summarizes:"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"The Palladian Rite 139 The First World War was to be fought so as to enable the Illuminati to overthrow the powers of the Tzars in Russia and turn that country into the stronghold of Atheistic-Communism. The differences stirred up by the Agentur of the Illuminati between the British and German Empires were to be sued to foment this war. After the war ended, Communism was to be built up and used to destroy other governments and weaken religions. World War Two was to be fomented by using the differences between Fascists and Political Zionists. This was to be fought so that Nazism would be destroyed and the power of Political Zionism increased so that the sovereign state of Israel could be established in Palestine. During world war two International Communism was to be built up until it equaled in strength that of united Christendom. At this point it was to be contained and kept in check until required for the final social cataclysm... World War Three is to be fomented by using the differences the agentur of the Illuminati stir up between Political Zionists and the Leaders of the Moslem world. The war is to be directed in such a manner that Islam and Political Zionism (including the State of Israel) will destroy themselves while at the same time the remaining nations, once more divided against each other on this issue, will be forced to fight themselves into a state of complete exhaustion physically, mentally, spiritually and economically... 12 Pike then told Mazzini that, after World War Three would have ended, a global social cataclysm will be provoked that will be greater than the world has ever known: We shall unleash the Nihilists [meaning terrorists] and the atheists, and we shall provoke a formidable social cataclysm which in all its horror will show clearly to the nations the effect of absolute atheism, origin of savagery and of the most bloody turmoil. Then everywhere, the citizens, obliged to defend themselves against the world minority of revolutionaries, will exterminate those destroyers of civilization, and the multitude, disillusioned with Christianity, whose deistic spirits will from that moment be without compass or direction, anxious for an ideal, but without knowing where to render its adoration, will receive the true light through the universal manifestation of the pure doctrine of Lucifer, brought finally out in the public view. This manifestation will result from the general reactionary movement which will follow the destruction of Christianity and atheism, both conquered and exterminated at the same time. 13 Nihilism Nihilism is a philosophy derived originally from the ideas of Shabbetai Zevi and Jacob Frank, but became an applicable political strategy through Mikhail Bakunin. Bakunin was a Grand Orient Freemason, a disciple of Weishaupt, and an avowed Satanist. Bakunin left Russia in 1842 and moved to Paris where he"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 140 met Marx. He participated in the 1848 French Revolution, and then moved to Germany where he called for the overthrow of the Habsburg Empire. The most famous episode of Bakunin’s later years was his quarrel with Marx. While living in Geneva in 1868, he joined the socialist First International. At the same time, however, he enrolled his followers in a semi-secret Social Democratic Alliance, which had a direct affiliation to the Illuminati, and which he conceived as a revolutionary avant-garde within the International. 14 The First International was opposed to Bakunin’s activities, and at a congress in 1872 at The Hague, Marx secured the expulsion of Bakunin and his followers from the International. The resulting split in the revolutionary movement in Europe and the United States persisted for many years. In the first meeting of Social Democratic Alliance, Bakunin openly professed atheism, and called for the Illuminati goals of the abolition of marriage, property, and of all social and religious institutions. It is from the philosophy of Nihilism, being the belief in the use of violence to achieve political ends, that twentieth century terrorism was devised, and which was eventually adopted by those Islamic fundamentalists in the employ of the Illuminati. In the Catechism of a Revolutionist, published by Bakunin, was included the famous passage, defining the mentality of a terrorist: The Revolutionist is a doomed man. He has no private interests, no affairs, sentiments, ties, property nor even a name of his own. His entire being is devoured by one purpose, one thought, one passion - the revolution. Heart and soul, not merely by word but by deed, he has severed every link with the social order and with the entire civilized world; with the laws, good manners, conventions, and morality of that world. He is its merciless enemy and continues to inhabit it with only one purpose - to destroy it. He despises public opinion. He hates and despises the social morality of his time, its motives and manifestations. Everything which promotes the success of the revolution is moral, everything which hinders it is immoral. The nature of the true revolutionist excludes all romanticism, all tenderness, all ecstasy, all love. 15 Nihilism’s political philosophy rejected all religious and political authority, social traditions, and traditional morality as standing in opposition to “freedom”. Every state thus became the enemy, and the enemy was ferociously attacked using terrorism and assassination. Reflecting the dictum of Weishaupt, Bakunin sought, “the unchaining of what is today called the evil passions and the destruction of what is called public order,” and made the declaration, still identified with nihilism: “Let us put our trust in the eternal spirit which destroys and annihilates only because it is the unsearchable and eternally creative source of all life – the passion for destruction is also a creative passion!” 16"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"141 Mohammed Abdul Wahhab The plot to prepare a third world war against Islam would be pursued by the Illuminati by continuing to develop its relationships with their brethren occultists in Egypt. Egypt would continue to play a pivotal role in the conspiracy against Islam. However, that role would be buttressed by another important contributor to the conspiracy, Saudi Arabia. While the occultists of Egypt would provide the necessary networks of Islamic terror, the ideology they adopted, to justify the use of terror, is derived from a heresy of Islam, known as Wahhabism, which was created in Arabia, now Saudi Arabia, by agents of the Illuminati in the eighteenth century. Before serving the purpose of defiling the message of Islam in the twentieth century, the creation of Wahhabism served the important British strategy of dividing to rule, by pitting the Arabs against their Turkish overlords. The Turks had conquered Constantinople, now Istanbul, in 1453, establishing the Ottoman Empire, and had carried out significant expansions into Europe. However, by 1683, the Turks’ campaign against the Europeans was curtailed, when they were decisively defeated in Vienna. The Empire had reached the peak of its expansion. Nevertheless, the Empire continued to command significant amounts of territory, and still held sway in regions where the British colonialism was hoping to expand. Therefore, following their typical strategy of “divide and rule”, the British, through their Masonic agent, sought to undermine the Ottoman Empire from within, by pitting against their own brothers in Islam, the Arabs of the peninsula. It was not legal in Islam for a Muslim to fight another Muslim. Therefore, in order to rile the Arabs against their Turkish brethren, it was necessary to first create a new interpretation of Islam that would sanction such murder, but under the guise of “Jihad”. This new interpretation came to be known as Wahhabism, and was founded by British agent, Mohammed Abdul Wahhab. Mohammed ibn Abdul Wahhab was born in 1703, in the small town in a barren wasteland called Najd, in the eastern part of what is now called Saudi Arabia. Ominously, Mohammed, the prophet of Islam, had already refused 15 : The Wahhabis"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 142 to confer blessings on the region, claiming that from it would emerge only “disturbances, disorder and the horns of Satan”. Abdul Wahhab’s father was a chief judge, adhering to the Hanbali school of Islamic jurisprudence, traditionally prevalent in the area. Yet, both he and Abdul Wahhab’s brother, Sulayman, detected signs of doctrinal deviance in him from early on. It was Sulayman who would first come out with a lengthy denunciation of his brother. Following his early education in Medina, Abdul Wahhab traveled outside of the peninsula, venturing first to Basra. He then went to Baghdad, where he married a wealthy bride and settled down for five years. According to Stephen Schwartz, in The Two Faces of Islam, “some say that during this vagabondage Ibn Abdul Wahhab came into contact with certain Englishmen who encouraged him to personal ambition as well as to a critical attitude about Islam.” 1 Specifically, Mir’at al Harramin, a Turkish work by Ayyub Sabri Pasha, written in 1888, states that in Basra, Abdul Wahhab had come into contact with a British spy by the name of Hempher, who “inspired in him the tricks and lies that he had learned from the British Ministry of the Commonwealth.” 2 The details of this relationship are outlined in a little known document by the name of The Memoirs of Mr. Hempher: A British Spy to the Middle East, said to have been published in series in the German paper Spiegel, and later in a prominent French paper. A Lebanese doctor translated the document to Arabic, from which it was translated to English and other languages. The Memoirs outlines the autobiographical account of Hempher, who claims to have acted as a spy on behalf of the British government, with the mission of seeking ways of undermining the Ottoman Empire. Because, as recorded by Hempher, the two principal concerns of the British government, with regards to its colonies in India, China and the Middle East, were: 1. To try to retain the places we have already obtained; 2. To try to take possession of those places we have not obtained yet. For we are the sort of people who have developed the habit of taking a deep breath and being patient. Hempher claims to have been one of nine spies sent to the Middle East for such a purpose. He reports, “we were designing long term plans to wage discord, ignorance, poverty, and even diseases in these countries. We were imitating the customs and traditions of these two countries, thus easily concealing our intentions.” The pretext Hempher was offered for his actions was: We, the English people, have to make mischief and arouse schism in all our colonies in order that we may live in welfare and luxury. Only by means of such instigations will we be able to demolish the Ottoman Empire. Otherwise, how could a nation with a small population bring another nation with a greater population under its sway? Look for the mouth of the chasm with all your might, and get in as soon as you find it. You should know that"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"The Wahhabis 143 the Ottoman and Iranian Empires have reached the nadir of their lives. Therefore, your first duty is to instigate the people against the administration! History has shown that “The source of all sorts of revolutions is public rebellions.” When the unity of Muslims is broken and the common sympathy among them is impaired, their forces will be dissolved and thus we shall easily destroy them. In 1710, the Minister of Colonies sent Hempher to Egypt, Iraq, Arabia and Istanbul, where he learned Arabic, Turkish and Islamic law. After two years, he first returned to London for briefing, before being sent to Basra, a mixed city of Sunni and Shiah, where Hempher met Abdul Wahhab. Recognizing his insolence towards the Koran and traditions of Islam, Hempher recognized him as the ideal candidate for the British strategy. To ensure his corruptibility, he had a temporary marriage arranged, known in Islam as Muttah marriage, and not considered legal, with a Christian women sent by the British government to seduce the Muslim men. As he had been told, “We captured Spain from the disbelievers [he means Muslims] by means of alcohol and fornication. Let us take all our lands back by using these two great forces again.” Hempher was then called away to parts of Iran, and then to Baghdad. In the interim, he was concerned that his pupil would be brought back to the fold by those more knowledgeable than he. And so, Hempher advised Abdul Wahhab to venture in the mean time to Iran, an area where the Shiah dominated, and which, according to Hempher, was plagued with ignorance, and therefore, less of a challenge to Wahhab’s heterodoxy. Wahhab did travel to Iran, territory of Shiah, a tradition contrary to his own, which was Sunni, and for which he later engendered quite a hatred. Therefore, his journey can only be explained as having been in the service of Hempher, who specifically advised him, “when you live among the Shiah, make Taqiya; do not tell them that you are Sunni lest they become a nuisance for you. Utilize their country and scholars! Learn their customs and traditions. For they are ignorant and stubborn people.” Because, as remarks Hamid Algar, in Wahhabism, A Critical Essay: If indeed he undertook such a journey despite his antipathy for Shi’ism, the motives that inspired him to do so are a mystery. There is no mention of Muhammed b. ‘Abd al-Wahhab in the Persian sources of the period, which may mean – always supposing that he indeed visited Iran – that his attempts at propagating his notions of rectitude were disregarded there as significant or that he contradicted himself by making provisional use of the Shi’i practice of taqiya (meaning to shield or guard, the practice that permits the believer to deny publicly his Shia membership for self-protection, as long as he continues to believe and worship in private). 3 Hempher was then again called back to London. This time his authorities were pleased with his activities, and agreed with his appraisal of"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 144 Abdul Wahhab. He was then introduced to certain secrets, many of which were contained in a thousand-page book that outlined the deficiencies of the Muslims, and prescribed ways to destroy them. The book notices that, despite commandments to the contrary in Islam, the Muslims’ weak points are as follows: sectarian divisions, illiteracy, and poor hygiene making them vulnerable to disease. They are ruled by unjust dictatorships, there is poor infrastructure, general disorderliness, where rules of the Koran are almost never put into practice. They exist in a state of near economic collapse, poverty, and retrogression. The military is weak, and weapons employed are out-of-date or obsolete. Women’s rights are commonly violated. What the book recommends corresponds closely with British and then American covert strategy in the Third World into the twentieth century. It recommends, in order to undermine the Muslims’ strong points, to popularize their other shortcomings, according to the following methods: foment discord and publish literature to further incite controversies. Obstruct education, and encourage forms of otherworldliness like mystical Sufism. Encourage oppressiveness among emperors. Encourage secularism, or the need to separate religion from state affairs. Aggravate economic decline through sabotage. Accustom statesmen to such indulgences as sex, sports, alcohol, gambling, and interest banking. Then, in order to make the new generation hostile towards their rulers and scholars, expose them for their corruption. In order to spread the misconception that Islam is chauvinistic towards women, they must encourage the misinterpretation of the verse in the Koran which state, “Men are dominant over women,” and the saying, “The woman is altogether evil.” Most importantly, they ought to introduce fanaticism among Muslims, and then criticize Islam as a religion of terror. The means of popularizing these vices were determined as having spies appointed as aides to Islamic statesmen, or passed off as slaves and concubines to be sold to their close relatives. Missionary projects are to be carried out in order to penetrate into all social classes of the society, especially into such professions as medicine, engineering, and bookkeeping. The publication of propaganda was to be issued using as fronts churches, schools, hospitals, libraries and charitable institutions in the Islamic countries. Millions of Christian books were to be distributed free of charge. Spies were to be disguised as monks and nuns, and placed in churches and monasteries, and appointed leaders of Christian movements. Eventually, the British administrators decided to come straight with Abdul Wahhab about their intentions for him. He agreed to cooperate, but on certain terms. Stipulations were that he was to be supported with adequate financing and weaponry, to protect himself against states and scholars who would certainly attack him after he would announce his ideas. And, that a principality ought to be established in his native country of Arabia. Finally, Hempher joined Abdul Wahhab in Najd, who was imparted with the obligations of declaring all Muslims, that is, all who did not follow him, as"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"The Wahhabis 145 disbelievers, and announce that it is permitted to kill them, to seize their property, to violate their chastity, and to enslave them and sell them at slave markets. He was to discourage Muslims from obeying the Sultan in Istanbul, and provoke revolt against him. He is to allege that all sacred sites and relics are idols, and that respect of them is tantamount of polytheistic and apostasy, and that they ought to be demolished. He is to do his best to produce occasions for insulting the Prophet Muhammad, his Khalifas, and all prominent scholars of Madhhabs, differing schools of legal interpretation. Finally, he was to do his utmost to encourage insurrections, oppressions and anarchy in Muslim countries. Ultimately, the reforms issued by the British through the mouth of Abdul Wahhab were designed to instigate the Muslims against other Muslims, and more specifically, against the Ottoman Empire. Thus, despite the very grave problems that were plaguing the Muslim world, as well and the encroachment of non-Muslim powers on traditional Muslim lands, Abdul Wahhab sought to identify the ills troubling the Muslims, in according to the stipulations of the plan, as their practice of visiting mausoleums and asking intercession from “saints”, or deceased holy men. Muslim worshippers were often in the habit of visiting the graves of holy men, and asking them to pray on their behalf. To fulfill his obligation to the British, Abdul Wahhab used this pretext to argue that, by asking help from someone other than God, they were actually “worshipping” these holy men, and were ignorantly committing an act of idolatry that caused them to forfeit Islam and become apostates. It was then permitted, he argued, to fight them. This was the pretext used by the British, through the mouth of Wahhabi, to incite the Arabs against the Turks. To further his argument, Wahhab suggested that all the world of Islam was mired in a state of ignorance, which could be likened to Arabia prior to the arrival of Islam. There are several instances in the Koran where God calls attention to the hypocrisy of a man who will pray to God alone when he is faced with some calamity, but that, once he is free of distress, returns to his idols. Abdul Wahhab declared then, that the Muslims were similar, and that, despite otherwise insisting they were worshipping the one God, they were nevertheless also idol worshippers. Thus, Abdul Wahhab fulfilled the prophecy of the Prophet Mohammed, who warned there would come a group who would “transfer the Koranic verses meant to refer to unbelievers and make them refer to believers.” Ibn Taymiyyah Finally, Abdul Wahhab declared it incumbent upon his followers to wage “Jihad” against all the Muslims, and that it was permitted for them to enslave their women and children. This approach was derived from the influence of Ibn Taymiyyah, who remains to this day an important influence guiding the"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 146 principles of Islamic terrorism. It is strange that, of all the Muslim scholars throughout history that he could have chosen from, that Wahhab, and all modern Muslim “reformers” after him, emphasize the importance of Ibn Taymiyyah, whose orthodoxy was questionable, and who in his own time was repeatedly in conflict with the leading scholars and the ruling establishment. Ibn Taymiyyah’s life was marked by persecutions. As early as 1293, he came into conflict with local authorities for protesting a sentence, pronounced under religious law, against a Christian accused of having insulted the Prophet. In 1298, he was accused of having criticized the legitimacy of the Islamic scholarly establishment, and of anthropomorphism, or ascribing human characteristics to God, despite a tradition in Islam of avoiding all such allusions. Ibn Battuta, the famous traveler and chronicler, reported that while Ibn Taymiyyah was preaching in the mosque, he said, “God comes down to the sky of this world just as I come down now,” and descended one step of the pulpit. 4 Opinions about Ibn Taymiyyah varied considerably. Even his enemies, like Taqi ud Din al Subki, were ready to concede to his virtues: “Personally, my admiration is even greater for the asceticism, piety, and religiosity with which God has endowed him, for his selfless championship of the truth, his adherence to the path of our forbearers, his pursuit of perfection, the wonder of his example, unrivalled in our time and in times past.” 5 And yet, he was chided by one of his own students, the famous historian and scholar, Al Dhahabi, who said, “Blessed is he whose fault diverts him from the faults of others! Damned is he whom others divert from his own faults! How long will you look at the motes in the eyes of your brother, forgetting the stumps in your own?” 6 It was for his intemperance that Ibn Battuta declared that Ibn Taymiyyah had a “screw loose”. 7 During the great Mongol crisis of the years 1299 to 1303, and especially during their occupation of Damascus, Ibn Taymiyyah led a party of resistance, and denounced the faith of the invaders which he considered suspect, despite their conversion to Islam. Until the Mongol invasion, Ibn Taymiyyah had lived in Harran, the seat of the occult Sabian community, and may have come under their influence. Their texts expounded on anthropomorphic visions of the cosmic Adam, in a manner similar to the Kabbalistic idea of Shiur Khomah. During the ensuing years, Ibn Taymiyyah was also engaged in intensive polemical activity against the Sufis and Shiah. In 1306, however, he was summoned to explain his beliefs to the governor’s council, which, although it did not condemn him, sent him to Cairo. There, Ibn Taymiyyah appeared before another council on the charge of anthropomorphism, and was imprisoned for eighteen months. If he adhered to such ideas, as was customary among Ismailis, he shared them only secretly with select disciples advanced to higher grades. Abu Hayyan, who knew him personally, held him in great esteem, until he was introduced to a work, in which Ibn Taymiyyah offered anthropomorphic descriptions of God. 8 The book had been acquired deceptively by a man who had pretended to be among his supporters, in order to receive the instructions that Ibn Taymiyyah reserved"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"The Wahhabis 147 only for his inner-circle of initiates. This demonstrates that Ibn Taymiyyah had one doctrine he espoused in public, and more esoteric doctrine he confided only to initiates, a doctrine similar to occult ideas. Ibn Taymiyyah’s repudiation of praying to saints was perceived by him as an attempt to purify Islamic monotheism. The pillar of Islamic belief is the unity of God, or monotheism. Islam began as a message that confronted the paganism of the Arabs, and called for a return to the worship of the one God, the same worshipped by the Prophets of the Old Testament. Therefore, worshipping any being or object other than God was considered tantamount to apostasy. This idea Abdul Wahhab carried to the extreme. The Saudi Family Eventually, the British Ministry of Commonwealth managed to acquire for Wahhab the support Mohammad Ibn Saud, the Amir of Dariyah. It was agreed between them that, from then on, power would be held among their descendants, with the Saudis maintaining political authority, and the Wahhabis administering the cult. The Saudis are an important Illuminati family, being secret Jews, like their Doenmeh counterparts in Turkey. According to Mohammad Sakher, who was apparently ordered killed for publishing his findings, Ibn Saud, though pretending to defend the reforms of Abdul Wahhab, was of Jewish origin. In the fifteenth century, Sakher maintains, a Jewish merchant from Basra, named Mordechai, immigrated to Arabia, settling in Dariyah, where he claimed to belong to the Arabian tribe of the Aniza, and there assumed the name of Markan bin Dariyah. 9 The Aniza tribe, to which the Saudis belong, as well as the ruling Sabah family of Kuwait, originally issued from Khaybar in Arabia, and there are well documented traditions about descendants of Jews from the region, who were supposedly forcibly converted to Islam. More specifically, according to modern occult legend, the Aniza are regarded as being the source of the European Witch Cult, through the person of Abu el-Atahiyya. These legends were popularized by Gerald Gardner, the founder of the modern cult of Wicca. Gardner was also a close associate of Aleister Crowley, as well as a Co-Freemason, the irregular branch of French masonry, co-founded by Annie Besant, which admits women to the 33rd degree. Gardner was also the friend and teacher of notorious charlatan Idries Shah, whose book on Sufism is disguised Luciferianism. Idries Shah described the “Maskhara” Dervishes who were also known as the “Revellers” and the “Wise Ones”, whose leader was Abu el-Atahiya. The name Aniza, he maintains, means goat and el-Atahiya was commemorated by the “Revellers” with the symbol of a torch burning between the horns of a goat, in obvious allusion to the Baphomet of the Templars. After Atahiya’s death, a group of his followers migrated to Moorish Spain. 10"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 148 In the early eighteenth century, the Aniza had entered the Syrian Desert where they established themselves as a powerful and influential tribe. German traveller Carlsten Niebuhr referred to them in 1761 as the strongest tribe in the Syrian Desert. Today the Aniza remain one of the largest Arabian tribes, having branches in Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. In Arabia, the Saudi family was primarily engaged in banditry, which pitted them in conflict against the Ottoman state. This, however, notes Schwartz, “also created a propensity for them to ally with the British, who were then taking control of the richer and more valuable parts of the Arabian Peninsula: the coastal emirates from Kuwait to Aden.” 11 By declaring the Ottomans all apostates, in 1746, the Wahhabi Saudi alliance made a formal proclamation of “Jihad” against all who did not share their understanding of Islam, thus merely “legalizing” their former practice of pillaging. In Islam, it is a very serious charge to accuse another Muslim of apostasy. A tradition claims that when one makes such an accusation, then surely either the accused or the accuser is an apostate. Such a dire warning did not deter Abdul Wahhab from declaring all those outside of his reforms as unbelievers. In 1746, even before he had aligned himself with Ibn Saud, Abdul Wahhab sent a thirty-man delegation to the Sharif of Mecca, to seek permission for he and his followers to perform the Hajj pilgrimage. The Sharif discerned an ulterior motive, of his desire to exploit the opportunity to disseminate his heresy, and therefore organized a debate between them and the scholars of Mecca and Medina. Abdul Wahhab’s emissaries failed to defend their views, and the Qadi, or chief judge, of Mecca, instead pronounced them unbelievers, declaring that they had been unjustified in declaring others as such. 12 From then on, the Wahhabi movement was characterized by maliciousness towards the Muslims, despite the encroachments the “infidel” British were making in the region. Motivated by a concern for their Indian enterprise, in 1755 Britain made an initial but unsuccessful attempt to pry Kuwait from the Ottomans. Ten years later, Mohammed Ibn Saud died and his son Abul Aziz became ruler of Dariyah. During the following two decades, the Wahhabis extended their sphere of influence, paralleling infiltration by the British. Britain again moved against Kuwait in 1775, seeking protection for their mail service through the territory, and attempted unsuccessfully again to seize it, when they were defeated by the Ottomans. Nevertheless, the following year, Abdul Wahhab declared himself leader of the Muslims of the world, in direct opposition to the authority of the Sultan in Istanbul, reinforced by a Fatwa ordering “Jihad” against the Ottoman Empire. And, significantly, in 1788, Abdul Aziz ibn Saud was joined by British forces in occupying Kuwait. In 1792, Abdul Wahhab died, and Abdul Aziz assumed the leadership of the Wahhabi movement, and extended raids over the next three years into the city of Medina, and the regions of Syria and Iraq. In 1801, the Wahhabis"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"The Wahhabis 149 attacked the Shiah holy city of Karbala, in Iraq, slaughtering thousands of its citizens. They ruined and looted the tomb of Husayn, the grandson of the Prophet Mohammed. As a result, it seems that Abdul Aziz was murdered in 1803, most likely by a Shiah avenger. His son Saud ibn Abdul Aziz then succeeded him. After sacking Karbala, the Wahhabis moved against Mecca. The Ottoman governor of Mecca failed to negotiate a peace, and retreated into the fortress in the city of Ta’if, where he was pursued by some 10,000 Wahhabis. In the taking of Ta’if, the Wahhabis then set about destroying all the holy tombs and burial grounds, followed by the mosques and Islamic madrassas. It is even said that the leather and gilt bindings of the Islamic holy books they had destroyed were used by them to make sandals. Al Zahawi, an Islamic historian of the time, recounted: They killed everyone in sight, slaughtering both child and adult, the ruler and the ruled, the lowly and the well-born. They began with a suckling child nursing at his mother’s breast and moved on to a group studying Koran, slaying them, down to the last man. And when they wiped out the people in the houses, they went out into the streets, the shops, and the mosques, killing whoever happened to be there. They killed even men bowed in prayer until they had exterminated every Muslim who dwelt in Ta’if and only a remnant, some twenty or more, remained. These were holed up in Bait al Fitni with ammunition, inaccessible to the Wahhabis’ approach. There was another group at Bait al Far numbering 270, who fought them that day, then a second and third day, until the Wahhabis sent them a guarantee of clemency; only they tendered this proposal as a trick. For when the Wahhabis entered, they seized their weapons and slew them to a man. They induced others to surrender with a guarantee of mercy and took them to the valley of Waj where they abandoned them in the cold and snow, barefoot, naked and exposed in shame with their women, accustomed to the privacy afforded them by common decency and religious morality. They then plundered their possessions, wealth of any kind, household furnishings, and cash. They cast books into the streets, alleys, and byways to be blown to and fro by the wind, among which could be found copies of Koran, volumes of Bukhari, Muslim, other canonical collections of Hadith and books of Islamic jurisprudence, all mounting to the thousands. These books remained there for several days, trampled upon by the Wahhabis. None among them made the slightest attempt to remove even one page of Koran from underfoot to preserve it from the ignominy of this display of disrespect. Then, they razed the houses, and made what was once a town a barren waste. 13 Next, the Wahhabis entered the holy city of Mecca. Ghalib, the Sharif of the city, repelled them, but Wahhabi raids then turned against Medina. Saud ibn Abdul Aziz addressed the people saying, “there is no other way for you than to submit. I will make you cry out and vanish as I did the people of Ta’if.” In Medina, they looted the Prophet’s treasure, including books, works of art, and other priceless relics that had been collected over a thousand years."},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 150 Finally, while in control of these two holy cities, they imposed their version of Islam, barred pilgrims from performing the Hajj, covered up the Kabbah with a rough black fabric, and set about the demolition of shrines and graveyards. Wahhabi perniciousness against the Ottoman Empire continued to serve British interests. During this period, Britain acquired as a client in southeast Arabia, the state of Oman, with sovereignty over Zanzibar in Africa and parts of the Iranian and neighboring coasts. Britain also expanded its influence northward into the area of the United Arab Emirates. The British also eventually seized control of Aden, on the southern coast of Yemen. Despite these encroachments into Muslim lands, by a hostile non-Muslim power, the Wahhabis would let nothing distract them from their “Jihad” against Islam. The Wahhabis persisted in their violence in Arabia until 1811, when Mohammed Ali Pasha, the viceroy of Egypt, was engaged by the Ottoman Sultan to address the Wahhabi nuisance. He appointed his son Tosun Pasha commander, but his forces were badly defeated. Ali Pasha then assumed command, and in 1812, swept through Arabia, eradicating the Wahhabi problem. Two of the worst Wahhabi fanatics, Uthman ul Mudayiqi and Mubarak ibn Maghyan, were sent to Istanbul, paraded through the streets, until they were executed. Ali Pasha also sent troops under his second son, Ibrahim Pasha, to root the Wahhabis out of Syria, Iraq and Kuwait. Those Arabs that had suffered at the hands of the Wahhabis rose in revolt, joining Ali Pasha’s forces. In 1818, the Wahhabi stronghold of Dariyah was taken and destroyed, though some of the Saudis received protection from the British in Jeddah. Saud ibn Adbul Aziz had died of fever in 1814, but his heir, Abdullah ibn Saud, was sent to Istanbul, where he was executed along with other captured Wahhabis. The rest of the Wahhabi clan was held in captivity in Cairo. Despite their initial defeat, the Wahhabis regrouped in Najd, establishing a new capital in Riyad. Within a few decades, the Wahhabis began a renewed expansion which, as noted by Hamid Algar, “was fortuitous in that it ultimately brought the Sauds into contact with the British who were not only seeking to consolidate their dominance of the Persian Gulf but also beginning to lay plans for the dismemberment of the Ottoman State.” 14"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"151 The Crown The first purpose served by the Wahhabis was aiding the Western powers in toppling the crumbling Ottoman Empire after World War One. This act opened up the Middle East to colonization, specifically, providing access to the monopoly of that most crucial of resource, oil.

Through this relationship, the Saudis would lead a central role in the Illuminati conspiracy in the 20th century, through both its aiding in the control of oil, and through the use of the wealth it would accumulate, to fund the spread of its deviant interpretation of Islam, and finally, and most importantly, to finance Islamic terrorism. The plot of the Illuminati is directed from London, where the objectives are guided by a financial oligarchy, in the City of London, which is run by the Bank of England, a private corporation. The square-mile-large City is a sovereign state, located in the heart of greater London. As the “Vatican of the financial world,” the City is not subject to British law. 1 It is said to be run by the “Crown”, meaning the British monarch, the titular head of the Illuminati, as the representative of the culmination of centuries of intermarriage among the Lucifarian bloodlines.

The Order of the Garter is the parent organization over Free Masonry, worldwide. When a Mason reaches the 33rd degree, he swears allegiance to that organization, and thereby to the Queen. According to researcher Dr. John Coleman, who interviewed a Grand Master at Oxford, the Knights of the Garter are the inner-sanctum, the elite of the elite of Her Majesty’s Most Venerable Order of St. John of Jerusalem. The Knights of the Order of the Garter are the leaders of the Illuminati hierarchy, and Queen Elizabeth II’s most trusted “Privy Council”. 3 Queen Elizabeth II heads a circle of individuals who represent the pinnacle of centuries of intermarrying among the aristocracy of Europe and Armenia, and more recently, of the family of Frederick II the Great of Prussia, and the descendants of Karl of Hessen-Kassel, the Grand Master of the Asiatic Brethren, Catherine the Great, and Queen Victoria. A central figure in this lineage is the Ethiopian Gannibal. Abram Petrovich Gannibal, a Black Falasha Jew of Ethiopia, was brought to Russia by Peter the Great, where he became a major-general. Gannibal was first taken to Istanbul to the court of the Ottoman Sultan, and then taken by the Russian Embassador, on orders from his superiors, one of whom was Pyotr Tolstoy, the great-grandfather of Leo Tolstoy. Gannibal was baptized in 1705, with Peter the Great as his godfather. During time in France, he became friends with leading Illuminati philosophers like Diderot, Montesquieu and Voltaire, who called him the “dark star of the Enlightenment”. Gannibal and his second wife had five children, including a son Osip. Osip in turn had a daughter Nadezhda, who was the mother of Aleksandr Pushkin. 4 Gannibal became the lover of Elizabeth Albertine, the mother of Charlotte Mecklenburg-Strelitz, queen consort of George III, King of England. Queen Charlotte’s son married the daughter of Frederick III of Hessen-Kassell. She was the grandmother of Queen Victoria. Charlotte’s brother was Charles II Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, whose daughter married the heir of the Prussian crown, Frederick William III.

Queen Victoria is more is recognized as the greatest monarch of the age, and her children and grandchildren married into nearly all the royal families of Europe. Less well known, however, is that this was achieved to almost a greater extent by Christian IX, the grandson of Karl Landgrave of Hessen-Kassel. Christian IX was, in the last years of his life, named Europe’s “father-in- law”. He was not expected to become king until a series of dubioius circumstances made him heir in 1852. He succeeded to the throne in 1863. He married Louise of Hessen-Kassel, the daughter of Karl’s brother, Frederick III of Hessen- Kassell, and Caroline of Nassau-Usingen, a descendant of Habsburg emperor Ferdinand I, and thorugh him, from the ibn Yahya family of Portugal. 5 At his death in 1906, their children or grandchildren sat on the thrones of Great Britain, Russia, Norway, Greece and, of course, Denmark itself.

The Illuminati comprises of a Supreme Council, in which a generational seat is accorded to a descendant of the Habsburgs, and to the ruling families of England and France. In America, the Illuminati were represented by old-money families, like the Rockefellers, Mellons, and Carnegies. 9 Heading the council, though, are the Rothschilds. With the power of the Church removed, as a result of the French and American Revolutions, the Rothschilds could embark on the great wealth- creating enterprise, founded on the formidable possibilities afforded through interest banking. Mayer Rothschild sent one of his five sons, Nathan, who showed exceptional ability in finance, at the age of twenty-one, with plans of securing control of the Bank of England. Mayer Rothschild also expanded his financial empire by installing each of his sons in other European cities, including Frankfurt, Vienna, Naples, Paris. Rothschild successfully kept the fortune in the family, according to ancient Illuminati practice, by carefully arranged marriages between closely related family members. In order to carefully maintain the bloodline, of the eighteen marriages made by Mayer Amschel Rothschild’s grandchildren, sixteen were contracted between first cousins. The most successful of the five sons were James in Paris and Nathan Mayer in London. In Paris, James had also achieved dominance in French finance. In Baron Edmond de Rothschild , David Druck writes of him that, “Rothschild’s wealth had reached the 600 million mark. Only one man in France possessed more. That was the King, whose wealth was 800 million."},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 156 The aggregate wealth of all the bankers in France was 150 million less than that of James Rothschild. This naturally gave him untold powers, even to the extent of unseating governments whenever he chose to do so. It is well known, for example, that he overthrew the Cabinet of Prime Minister Thiers.” 10 Before Nathan gained control of the Bank of England, he and his international entourage had been backing Germany to defeat Napoleon. Over the course of little more than a decade, Napoleon had acquired control of most of the western and central mainland of Europe. Following its conquest under Napoleon in 1806, the Holy Roman Empire had been abolished. Napoleon instead organized the Confederation of the Rhine, but it collapsed when his campaign failed in Russia 1813. A German Confederation was then created by the Congress of Vienna in 1815, to organize the surviving states of the Holy Roman Empire. Immediately after the Napoleonic wars, the Illuminati assumed that all the nations of Europe were so destitute and so weary of wars that they would willingly accept any solution. Through the Congress of Vienna, the Rothschilds had hoped to create a sort of early League of Nations, their first attempt at one-world government. However, Csar Alexander I, the son of Paul I of Russia, saw through the planned European Federation, recognizing it as an Illuminati ploy, and would not go along with it. Alexander was initially favourable to Freemasonry as well, but seems to have eventually turned against the political objectives of the secret societies. 11 Alexander instead signed a Treaty of Holy Alliance with Austria, and Frederick William III of Prussia, nephew to Frederick II, which guaranteed the sovereignty of any monarch who would adhere to Christian principles in the affairs of State. The enraged Nathan Rothschild, then the head of the dynasty, vowed that some day he or his descendants would destroy the Czar and his entire family, a threat which his descendants accomplish in 1917. 12 Napoleon staged a comeback known as the Hundred Days, but was defeated decisively at the Battle of Waterloo in Belgium, on June 18, 1815, followed shortly afterwards by his capture by the England, and his exile to the island of Saint Helena, where he died. When the Battle of Waterloo was about to be fought, Nathan was in Paris, and arranged for carrier pigeons to relay information about the fighting, as well as to provide disinformation to the British. Once he was sure the Duke of Wellington was victorious, he had his agents inform the British public of his defeat, and that Napoleon was on the war path. The stock market crashed, and values fell to an all-time low. Nathan then set off for London, where he and his associates bought all the stocks, bonds, shares, securities and other properties and they could afford. When the truth of Wellington’s victory became known, values returned to normal, and the Rothschilds made a fortune. 13 Nathan set up his London business, N. M. Rothschild and Sons, which also had branches with his brothers in Paris, Vienna, Berlin and Naples. His sons included Lionel Nathan, Anthony Nathan, Nathaniel, Mayer Amschel,"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"The Round Table 157 known as Baron Mayer de Rothschild. In 1816, four of the brothers were each granted the title of Baron or by Austria’s Francis von Habsburg, formerly Francis II, the last Holy Roman Emperor. Nathaniel de Rothschild, was the founder of the French wine-making branch of the Rothschild family, Château Mouton Rothschild, rivaled by his uncle James’ neighboring Château Lafite- Rothschild vineyard. In 1847, Lionel, who headed the bank, was first elected to the British House of Commons, as one of four MPs for the City of London, and in 1858, finally became the first Jewish member of Parliament. The Rothschilds soon learned that lending money to governments and kings was more profitable than lending to private individuals. Not only were the size of loans far greater, but they were secured by the nation’s taxes. By cooperating within the family, and using the fractional reserve techniques of interest-banking, the Rothschilds’ banks soon dominated all European banking, and they became the wealthiest family in all the world. Thus, E.C. Knuth wrote, in The Empire of the City , “The fact that the House of Rothschild made its money in the great crashes of history and the great wars of history, the very periods when others lost their money, is beyond question.” 14 The Rothschild family would play a crucial role in international finance for next two centuries. As Frederick Morton, in The Rothschilds wrote, “For the last one hundred and fifty years the history of the House of Rothschild has been to an amazing extent the backstage history of Western Europe.” 15 Although, as Morton noted, “Someone once said that the wealth of Rothschild consists of the bankruptcy of nations.” 16 The Round Table The promotion of the interests of the “Crown” became the guiding principle of that society through which the Illuminati carried out all of its key strategies in the twentieth century, the Round Table, which was founded through the sponsorship of the Rothschilds. The siphoning of the British people’s wealth into the coffers of the Illuminati in the City of London, created severe economic equalities, and stifled the nation’s ability to adapt technologically at a pace similar to that of the rapidly expanding nation of Germany. And so, by the 1870s, the British Empire reached its high point, and England began the longest economic depression in its history, one that it was not to recover from until the 1890s. Therefore, the country of Britain no longer provided the economic capacity to support the global ambitions of the Illuminati. It was at that point that the Illuminati sought to confer increasing power to its branches in the United States, which it could rule by proxy in the coming century, while still based financially in Britain. The son of Baron Lionel Rothschild, Nathaniel Mayer, also known as “Natty” de Rothschild, became head of NM Rothschild and Sons after his father’s death in 1879. In 1876, he had succeeded to the Baronetcy, created for his uncle"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 158 Anthony Rothschild, who died without a male heir. In 1884, Nathaniel Mayer became the first Jew elevated to the House of Lords. Following the Rothschild’s funding of the Suez Canal, Natty de Rothschild developed a close relationship with Benjamin Disraeli and affairs in Egypt. Natty also funded Cecil Rhodes in the development of the British South Africa Company, and the De Beers diamond conglomerate. He administered Rhodes’s estate after his death in 1902, and helped to set up the Rhodes Scholarship at Oxford University. In the first of seven wills, Cecil Rhodes called for the formation of a “secret society”, devoted to “the extension of British rule throughout the world.” Rhodes posited that only the “British elite” should be entitled to rule the world for the benefit of mankind. In other words, the Illuminati of the City of London would exploit the expansion of British imperialism, to increase their control over gold, the seas, the world’s raw materials, but most importantly, after the turn of the century, a new precious commodity: oil. The goals Rhodes articulated included the “ultimate recovery of the United States as an integral part of the British Empire”, and would culminate in: ...consolidation of the whole Empire, the inauguration of a system of Colonial Representation in the Imperial Parliament which may tend to weld together the disjointed members of the Empire, and finally the foundation of so great a power as to hereafter render wars impossible and promote the best interests of humanity. 17 In his third will, Rhodes left his entire estate to Freemason Lord Nathaniel Rothschild as trustee. Rhodes had also been initiated into Freemasonry in 1877, shortly after arriving at Oxford, and joined a Scottish Rite Lodge. To chair Rhodes’ secret society, Lord Nathaniel Rothschild appointed Alfred Milner, who then recruited a group of young men from Oxford and Toynbee Hall. All were well-known English Freemasons, among them Rudyard Kipling, Arthur Balfour, also Lord Rothschild, and other Oxford College graduates, known collectively as “Milner’s Kindergarten.” And, with a number of other English Freemasons, they founded together the Round Table. 18 The man charged by the Round Table with bringing the United States within the financial control of the Rothschilds was German-born Jacob Schiff. In America, Schiff bought into Kuhn and Loeb, a well-known private banking firm. Shortly after he became a partner, he married Loeb’s daughter, Teresa. Then he bought out Kuhn’s interests and moved the firm to New York, where it became Kuhn, Loeb, and Company, international bankers, with Schiff, agent of the Rothschilds, ostensibly as sole owner. Then, following the Civil War, Schiff began to finance the great operations of the Robber Barons. Thus, Jacob Schiff financed the Standard Oil Company for John D. Rockefeller, the Railroad Empire for Edward R. Harriman, and the Steel Empire for Carnegie. However, instead of monopolizing all the other industries for Kuhn, Loeb, and Company, Schiff opened the doors of the House of Rothschild to"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"The Round Table 159 bankers like J.P. Morgan. In turn, the Rothschilds arranged the setting up of London, Paris, European and other branches for these bankers, but always in partnerships with Rothschild subordinates, and with Jacob Schiff in New York as boss. Thus, at the turn of the nineteenth century, Schiff exercised firm control of the entire banking fraternity on Wall Street, which by then, with Schiff’s help, included Lehman brothers, Goldman-Sachs, and other internationalist banks that where headed by men chosen by the Rothschilds. 19 John D. Rockefeller Sr. was tasked by the Rothschilds, through their agents John Jacob Astor and Jacob Schiff, to gain control of the American oil industry. 20 The Rockefellers are themselves an important Illuminati family, being Marranos, who initially moved to Ottoman Turkey, and then France, before arriving in America. 21 John D. Rockefeller Sr. founded Standard Oil, which, through the second half of the nineteenth century, achieved infamy for its ruthless practices towards its competitors. Growing public hostility toward monopolies, of which Standard Oil Trust was the most egregious example, caused a number of states to enact anti-monopoly laws, leading to the passage of the Sherman Antitrust Act by Congress in 1890. In 1892, the Ohio Supreme Court decided that Standard Oil was in violation of it monopoly laws. Rockefeller evaded the decision by dissolving the trust, and transferring its properties to companies in other states, with interlocking directorates, so that the same men continued to control its operations. In 1899, these companies were brought back together in a holding company, Standard Oil Company of New Jersey, which existed until 1911, when the U.S. Supreme Court declared it in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act, and therefore illegal. The splintered company, though under various names, continued to be run by Rockefeller. Thus, the fate of the world would be guided the Round Tablers, headed by the Rothschilds in London, and their various subsidiaries, aided by the control Rockefeller would come to exercise over the United States through his monopoly of its crucial oil supply. Carol Quigley, President Clinton’s now deceased Georgetown University Professor and mentor, in Tragedy and Hope: A History of Our Time, explained: There does exist, and has existed for a generation, an international Anglophile network which operates, to some extent, in the way the radical Right believes the Communists act. In fact, this network, which we may identify as the Round Table Groups, has no aversion to cooperating with the Communists, or any other groups, and frequently does so. I know of the operations of this network because I have studied it for twenty years and was permitted for two years, in the early 1960’s, to examine its papers and secret records. I have no aversion to it or to most of its aims and have, for much of my life, been close to it and many of its instruments. 22"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 160 Quigley further confirms that the far-reaching aim of this network “is nothing less than to create a world system of financial control in private hands able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole.

The means by which this was to be accomplished was through the spread of Scottish Rite Freemasonry in the Middle East, in order to recruit members into the conspiracy, who would then contribute by acting as reformers, and misguiding the Muslim community into backwards and belligerent principles, now known collectively as “fundamentalism”. This strategy was spearhead by what has been referred to as the Oxford Movement, established in the 1820’s, with a group of missionaries appointed by a combined grouping of Oxford University, the Anglican Church, and Kings College of London University, all under Scottish Rite Freemasonry. 1 The center of this activity, again, was Egypt. The movement would continue to capitalize on the theme of Egyptian Freemasonry created by Cagliostro, as Egypt, in this case, was of particular importance, as the Scottish Rite Freemasons regarded themselves as the inheritors of the classical Gnostic tradition that had survived through the Grand Lodge of the Fatimid Ismailis The leading promoters of the Oxford Movement were Pike’s fellow member of the Palladian Rite, Lord Palmerston, and Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli, and Edward Bullwer-Lytton, the leader of a branch of the English Rosicrucians, a branch of Rosicrucianism that developed from the Asiatic Brethren. The Oxford movement was further supported by the Jesuits. Also involved were the British royal family itself, and many of its leading prime ministers and aides. Benjamin Disraeli was Grand Master of Freemasonry, as well as knight of the Order of the Garter. It was in Coningsby, that he confessed, through a character named Sidonia, modeled on his friend Lionel de Rothschild, that, “the world is governed by very different personages from what is imagined by those who are not behind the scenes.” Of the influence of the secret societies, Disraeli also remarked, in Parliamentary debate: 17 : The Salafi"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 162 lt is useless to deny. . . a great part of Europe – the whole of Italy and France, and a great portion of Germany, to say nothing of other countries – are covered with a network of these secret societies, just as the superficies of the earth is now being covered with railroads. And what are their objects? They do not attempt to conceal them. They do not want constitutional government. They do not want ameliorated institutions; they do not want provincial councils nor the recording of votes; they want. . . an end to ecclesiastical establishments. . . . 2 Bulwer-Lytton was the Grand Patron of the Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia (SRIA), founded in 1865 by Robert Wentworth Little, and based on the Asiatic Brethren. Many members of the Asiatic Brethren, or Fratres Lucis, had become members of a German Masonic lodge called L’Aurore Naissante, or “the Nascent Dawn”, founded in Frankfurt-on-Main in 1807. It was at this lodge where Lord Bulwer Lytton was initiated. 3 Bulwer-Lytton, who served as the head of Britain’s Colonial Office and India Office, was also a practicing member of the cult of Isis and Osiris. He wrote the Last Days of Pompeii, and The Coming Race, or Zanoni, in which he set the foundations for later Nazi racist theories. He became the grandfather of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood of John Ruskin, the Metaphysical Society of Bertrand Russell, and occult societies like the Golden Dawn of Aldous Huxley, and the Theosophical Society of Madame Blavatsky. In Egypt, the Oxford movement centered on the creation of a “reform” movement of Islam, known as the Salafi. Initially, the creation of the Salafi reform movement would serve as an early example of the methods in which Islamic terrorists were used in the future. As in more recent occurances, the Islamists were used to provide a pretext for invasion, to safeguard a most important commodity, oil. Essentially, the Salafi were employed in the protection of Britain’s growing interest in the Suez Canal, as it would later become crucial to the shipment of their oil cargo to Europe and elsewhere . In 1854 and 1856, Ferdinand de Lesseps had obtained concessions from Said Pasha, the viceroy of Egypt, who authorized the creation of a company for the purpose of constructing a maritime canal open to ships of all nations. The canal had a dramatic impact on world trade, playing an important role in increasing European penetration and colonization of Africa. In 1875, the mounting debts of Said Pasha’s successor, Ismail Pasha, forced him to sell Egypt’s share in the canal to the British. Thus, the British government, under Benjamin Disraeli, financed by his friend, Lionel Rothschild, aquired nearly half the total shares in the Suez Canal Company, and though not a majority interest, it was for practical purposes a controlling interest. A commission of inquiry into the failing finances of Ismail in 1878, led by Evelyn Baring, First Earl of Cromer, and others, had compelled the viceroy into ceding his estates to the nation, to remain under British and French supervision, and accepting the position of a constitutional sovereign."},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"The Salafi 163 The angered Egyptians united around Ahmed Urabi, a revolt that ultimately provided a pretext for the British to move in an “protect” the Suez Canal, followed by a formal invasion and occupation that made Egypt a colony. The agent provocateur revolt against Ismail was organized by movement of Jamal ud Din al Afghani, the founder of the so-called Salafi “reform” movement in Islam. Aghani was t he person through which the British mission acted to, not only subvert Egyptian rule, but to spread its occult influence throughout the Middle East. Throughout his forty-year career as a British intelligence agent, Jamal ud al Afghani was guided by two British Islamic and cult specialists, Wilfred Scawen Blunt and Edward G. Browne. 4 E. G. Browne was Britain’s’ leading Orientalist of the nineteenth century, and numbered among his protégés at Cambridge University’s Orientalist department Harry “Abdullah” St. John B. Philby, a British intelligence specialist behind the Wahhabi movement. Wilfred S. Blunt, another member of the British Orientalist school, was given the responsibility by the Scottish Rite Masons to organize the Persian and the Middle East lodges. Al Afghani was their primary agent. 5 Very little is known of Jamal ud Din al Afghani’s origins. Despite the appellation “Afghani”, which he adopted and by which he is known, there are some reports that he was a Jew. 6 On the other hand, some scholars believe that he was not an Afghan but a Iranian Shiah. And, despite posing as a reformer of orthodox Islam, al Afghani also acted as proselytizer of the Bahai faith, the first recorded project of the Oxford Movement, a creed that would become the heart of the Illuminati’s one-world-religion agenda. In 1845, Afghani’s family had enrolled him in a madrassa (Islamic school) in the holy city of Najaf, in what is now Iraq. There, Afghani was initiated into “the mysteries” by followers of Sheikh Ahmad Ahsai. Sheikh Zeyn ud Din Ahmad Ahsai was the founder of the Shaikhi school. Ahsai was succeeded after his death by Seyyed Mohammad Rashti, who introduced the idea of a “perfect Shiah, called Bab, meaning “gate”, who is to come. In 1844, Mirza Mohammad Ali claimed to be this promised Bab, and founded Babism, among whose followers Afghani also may have had certain family connections. 7 One of the Bab’s followers, Mirza Hoseyn Ali Nuri, announced that he was the manifestation the “One greater than Himself”, predicted by the Bab, assuming the title of Baha Ullah, meaning in Arabic “Glory of God”. Baha Ullah was descended from the rulers of Mazandaran, a province in northern Iran, bordering the Caspian Sea in the north. These were an Ismaili dynasty, who had intermarried with descendants of Bostanai, Exilarch of the seventh century AD. 8 Referring to himself, Baha Ullah stated, “The Most Great Law is come, and the Ancient Beauty ruleth upon the throne of David. Thus hath My Pen spoken that which the histories of bygone ages have related.” 9 Baha Ullah founded the Bahai faith, which drew on a mix of Islam, Christianity, Zoroastrianism and Judaism, but claimed to supercede all other"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 164 religions in a “one world faith”. The principal Bahai tenets are the essential unity of all religions and the unity of humanity. Bahais believe that all the founders of the world’s great religions have been manifestations of God and agents of a progressive divine plan for the education of the human race. Therefore, according to the Bahais, despite their differences, the world’s great religions teach an identical truth. However, the Bahais quickly found themselves disliked in Persia for their extremism. In 1852, a Bahai leader was arrested for the attempted assassination of the Shah of Persia, after which the movement was suppressed, and many members were exiled to Baghdad and Istanbul. Throughout this time, as reports Robert Dreyfuss, the Bahai leaders maintained close ties to both Scottish Rite Freemasonry and various movements that began to proliferate throughout India, the Ottoman Empire, Russia and even Africa. 10 A l Afghani is thought to be from Asadabad, a town in Persia, near Hamadan, an area of Ismaili settlement. Like the Ismailis before him, Afghani believed in the need of religion for the masses, while reserving the subtler truth of atheism for the elite. According to Nikki R. Keddie, in her study of Afghani, “much as esoteric Ismaili doctrines had in earlier centuries provided different levels of interpretation of the same texts, binding masses and elite in a common program, so Jamal ud Din’s practice of different levels of teaching could weld the rationalist elite and the more religious masses into a common political movement.” 11 Several of those who witnessed Afghani’s teachings confirm his deviation from orthodoxy. Among them was Lutfi Juma, who recounted, “his beliefs were not true Islam although he used to present they were, and I cannot judge about the beliefs of his followers.” And again, Dr. Shibli Shumayyil, a Syrian admirer of his, writes that, when he heard that Afghani had written a treatise against the “materialists”, he commented, “I was amazed, because I knew that he was not a religious man. It is difficult for me after my personal experience of the man to pass definite judgment regarding what I heard about him afterwards, but I am far more inclined to think that he was not a believer.” 12 In addition, Afghani had acquired considerable knowledge of Islamic philosophy, particularly of the Persians, including Avicenna, Nasir ud Din Tusi, and others, and of Sufism. Evidence also proves that he possessed such works, but also that he showed interest in occult subjects, such as mystical alphabets, numerical combinations, alchemy and other Kabbalistic subjects. Also demonstrating Afghani’s interest in mysticism, of a Neoplatonic type, is a twelve-page treatise on Gnosticism copied in his handwriting. There is much controversy as to Afghani’s activities during the period of 1858-1865. However, according to one biographer, Salim al Anhuri, a Syrian writer who later knew him in Egypt, Afghani’s first travels outside of Iran were to India. It was there, he maintains, that Afghani acquired his heretical bent. His studies in religion, relates Anhuri, led into atheism and pantheism. Essentially, Afghani believed in a philosophy akin to Lurianic Kabbalah, of a"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"The Salafi 165 natural evolution of the universe, of which the intellectual progress of man was a part. As Anhuri described, Afghani believed: Man began by saying that he would pass on after his death to an eternal life, and that the wood or the stone were what would lead him to his highest place if he showed reverence to it and showered devotion upon it, and there arose from this worship liberation from the bitterness of thought about a death with no life after it. Then it occurred to him that fire was more powerful and greater in benefit and harm, so he turned to it. Then he saw that the clouds were better than fire and stronger, so he adhered to and depended on them. The links of this chain, wrought by the two tools of delusion and desire together with the instinct and nature of man, continued to increase until man culminated at the highest state. The result of natural laws was a reaction leading to the conviction that all the above is idle talk which originates in desires, and that it has no truth and no definition. 13 In 1866, Afghani appeared in Qandahar, Afghanistan, less than two decades after the unsuccessful attempts of the British, in league with the Aga Khan. And, according to a report, from a man who must have been an Afghan with the local government, Afghani was: ...well versed in geography and history, speaks Arabic and Turkish fluently, talks Persian like an Irani. Apparently, follows no particular religion. His style of living resembles more that of an European than of a Muslim. 14 At the end of 1866, Afghani became confidential counselor Azam, the ruler in Afghanistan. That a foreigner should have attained such a position so quickly was remarked upon in contemporary accounts. Some scholars have speculated that Afghani, then calling himself “Istanbuli”, was, or represented himself to be, a Russian agent able to obtain for Azam Russian money and political support against the British, with whom Azam was on bad terms. When Azam lost the throne to one of his rival, Shir Ali, he was suspicious of Afghani, and had him expelled from his territory in November 1868. Throughout his stay in Afghanistan, Afghani had maintained ties to the Bahais, British Freemasons, and certain Sufis based in India, where he also met with Nizari Muslims. According to British intelligence reports of the time, during his repeated travels to India, Afghani went by the name of Jamal ud Din Effendi. It is then that would visit the Aga Khan, the leader of the Ismailis. And, despite posing as a Sufi Sheikh of the Mawlavi order, or Mevlevi, who follow the very influential Iranian mystic and poet of the thirteenth century, Jalal ud Din ar Rumi, he was also proselytizing for the Bahai faith, purportedly having been sent on such a mission by Baha Ullah himself. One of such report, dated 1891, is from an unnamed Indian Muslim, acting as a British agent, who pretended to become a Bahai in order to gather more information, and reads:"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 166 The following is the substance of a statement made by an apparently well informed person, as to the real objects of the presence in India of Saiyid Jamal-ud-din, who is described by the informant as a Persian, but who calls himself a Turk of Constantinople:- In the city of Akka (? Acre) shore now lives one Husen Ali, a Turk, who calls himself Baha-ullah Effendi alias Jamal Mubarik [the Blessed Beauty]. This man declares all religions to be bad, and says that he himself is God. He converted a number of people and collected them at Baghdad. About four years ago they rebelled against the Shah, but they were suppressed and gradually withdrew from Persia to Turkey in Asia. Baha-ullah is now under surveillance at Akka, which is called “Az Maksud” [Ar Maqud, a common term among Iranian Bahais for the Holy Land] by the converts. Balla-ullah’s agents go about to all countries and endeavour to persuade people that he is visited by messengers of God, and that his converts will become rulers of the earth. Baha-ullah’s son, Muhammad Ali, came to Bombay on this mission, and then returned to Akka. Agents are appointed everywhere, Saiyid Jamal- ud-din is one of these agents. He came to Kailaspur and stayed 10 days with me. He told me all about Baha-ullah and his own mission, and proposed to appoint me as his agent, and asked me to go with him to Bombay to see Muhammad Ali. I agreed to become a disciple of Baha-ullah in order to discover why Saiyid Jamal-ud-din had come to India. I agreed to become his agent for the same reason, and he now often writes to me. I have not got his letters with me, but can produce them if wanted. He is now in Farukhabad, and I believe that he has obtained a number of converts in India. He has plenty of money and spends it freely, and goes first class by railway. There is in Bombay a man named Agha Saiyid Mirza [Afnan], a merchant of Shiraz, who supplies him plentifully with money. 15 ...On the 21st September 1891, the same informant wrote direct to the General Supdt., T. and D. Department [General Superintendent, Thagi and Dakaiti Department, responsible for monitoring criminals and trouble-makers], as follows:– “The man Saiyid Jamal-ud-din Shah is no ‘Rumi,’ he is a man from Astrabad Mazinderan in Persia, and his name is Mirza Muhammad Ali. He is no Muhammadan [Muslim] but a “Babi,” and his head-quarters are at Akka in Palestine. 16 Afghani then appeared in Istanbul in 1870, brought there by Ali Pasha, himself a Freemason, and Grand Vizier five times during the reign of Sultan Abdul Majid and Sultan Abdul Aziz. Afghani was severely disliked by the clergy for his heretical views, however. Hasan Fahmi, a leading scholar of his time, and the Shaikh al-Islam of the Ottoman Empire, pronounced a Fatwa declaring Afghani a disbeliever, and he was expelled. In 1871, Afghani went to Cairo, sponsored by Prime Minister Mustafa Riad Pasha, who had met him in Istanbul, and who then placed him on a generous salary, and had him appointed to the prestigious Muslim university of Al Azhar. Initially, Afghani remained strictly orthodox, but in 1878, he moved into the"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"The Salafi 167 Jewish quarter of Cairo, where he began open political organizing. Afghani then announced the formation of the Arab Masonic Society. And, despite their public profession of orthodox Islam, the members of Afghanis inner-circle evinced their adherence to the Gnosticism of the Ismailis. Afghani would refer to his Masonic brethren as ikhwan al saffa wa khullan al wafa, in deliberate reference to the tenth century Ismaili brotherhood by the same name. 17 With the help of Riad Pasha and the British embassy, Afghani reorganized the Scottish Rite and Grand Orient lodges of Freemasonry, and began to organize around him a network of several Muslim countries, particularly Syria, Turkey, and Persia. 18 For the next few years he attracted a following of young writers and activists, among them Mohammed Abduh, who was to become the leader of what is often regarded as the “modernist” movement in Islam, otherwise known as the Salafi, and Sad Pasha Zaghlul, self-professed Freemason, and founder of Wafd, the Egyptian nationalist party. 19 The Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor Afghani would have purportedly been a representative of a mysterious Egyptian quasi-Masonic secret society, which supposedly represented a survival of the Sabian teachings of the Grand Lodge of the Ismailis of Cairo, which became known among Western occultists as the Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor (H.B. of L.), also thought to have had originally been the influence behind the creation of Samuel Honis’ Rite of Mizraim. One of Afghani’s closest associates was James Sanua. Sanua was born in Cairo to a well-connected Italian Jewish family of Sephardic origin. Sanua was raised as a Jew by his father, who had been born in Italy, and went on to become a valued advisor to the Egyptian royal family. In addition to his Jewish upbringing, and fluency in eight languages, Sanua became so well- versed in the Koran and Islamic lore that he earned himself the title “sheikh”, a factor which led to rumors of his conversion to Islam. As a youngster, Sanua had studied in Italy, where he was introduced to the ideas of Giuseppe Mazzini. When he returned to Cairo, he was wholeheartedly devoted to the teachings of Mazzini. Sanua was also responsible for establishing the foundation of the modern Egyptian theater, a forerunner to its well-known film industry. However, his plays became suspect in the eyes of the Egyptian authorities. And, when he learned of a plot to poison him, he fled to France, where he preferred to be known as Abu Naddara. In Paris, Sanua founded a journal dedicated to the principle, much like that of the Bahai, of a one-world-religion, often featuring articles by Afghani. Sanua’s girlfriend Lydia Pashkov, was a woman of Russian origin and correspondent for Le Figaro in Paris. Through their circles, Afghani became friendly with the directors of the Illuminati regional headquarters in southern Lebanon, like"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 168 Sheik Medjuel el-Mezrab, who married British dilettante, Jane Digby, and Lydia Pashkov. Between 1870 and 1875, the Illuminati apparently began a project to replicate the Italian Carbonari in all the countries of the Middle East. 20 Both Sanua and Lydia Pashkov were also friends and traveling companions of Helena P. Blavatksy, who in 1856, Mazzini had initiated into the Carbonari. Helena P. Blavatsky, the famous medium and mystic, was the godmother of the occult revival of the late nineteenth century. After writing monumental works such as Isis Unveiled, and The Secret Doctrine, the Theosophical Society was formed in 1875, to spread her teachings worldwide. The Theosophical Society had Freemasons Henry Steel Olcott and George H. Felt appointed president and vice-president respectfully. Among the early members was also Albert Pike. According to Manly P. Hall, a leading Masonic historian: The Secret Doctrine and Isis Unveiled are Madame Blavatsky’s gifts to humanity, and to those whose vision can pierce the menacing clouds of imminent disaster it is no exaggeration to affirm that these writings are the most vital literary contribution to the modern world. No more can they be compared with other books than can the light of the sun be compared with the lamp of the glowworm. The Secret Doctrine assumes the dignity of a scripture. 21 Blavatsky claimed to receive her revelations from “Secret Chiefs”, or disembodied “Ascended Masters”, who were aiding humanity to evolve into a race of supermen. At first, Blavatsky attributed names to these Masters, like “Tuitit Bey”, “Serapis Bey”, and “Hilarion”, who purportedly belonged to the “Brotherhood of Luxor”. According to Joscelyn Godwin, in The Theosophical Enlightenment, if we interpret the “Brotherhood of Luxor” to be the coterie of occultists with which Blavatsky was associated in Egypt, then we ought to assume Jamal ad-Din al Afghani to have been one of its members. 22 Although there is no direct evidence of Blavatsky having met with Afghani, according to K. Paul Johnson, in The Masters Revealed, circumstances would suggest such contact. Not only was Afghani familiar with her associates Sanua and Pashkov, but he and Blavatsky were both in India in 1857 and 1858, both in Tbilisi in the mid-sixties, and both in Cairo in 1871. Again, Afghani left Egypt for India in late 1879, the same year that Blavatsky and Olcott arrived there. After leaving India in late 1882, he resided in Paris throughout 1884, the year in which Blavatsky spent the summer there. Through Jamal ud Din al Afghani, Blavatsky acquired her central doctrines, derived from Ismailism, which she would then communicate the Western occult community. As Johnson points out, in Blavatsky’s article, The Eastern Gupta Vidy and the Kabbalah, she claims the “real Kabbalah” is to be found in the Chaldean Book of Numbers. Although it is unknown to scholars, Blavatsky cites this book frequently in her tomes, Isis Unveiled and The Secret Doctrine. She claims to have received it from a “Persian Sufi”, and as K. Paul Johnson points out, Afghani is its most likely source."},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"The Salafi 169 According to Johnson, a fundamental structure in Blavatsky’s doctrines can only be attributed to one source, which is also related to the ideas of another occultist, Gurdjieff: Ismaili Gnosticism. The Chaldean Book of Numbers teaches a sevenfold cosmology similar to the eclectic Ismaili mysticism. “The centrality of the number seven”, notes Johnson: ...is a major clue which points to Ismaili gnosis as an important source for both Blavatsky and Gurdjieff. Henri Corbin’s Cyclical Time and Ismaili Gnosis describes the doctrine of a sevenfold cosmic evolutionary process, repeated in a sevenfold historical scheme, paralleled by a sevenfold initiatory path for the individual adept. This corresponds exactly to the Mahatma letters [of Blavatsky] teaching that “the degrees of an Adept’s initiation mark the seven stages at which he discovers the secret of the sevenfold principles in nature and man and awakens his dormant powers.” The doctrine of the Resurrection acquires a specific meaning in Ismaili gnosis which relates it to Blavatsky’s teachings. Each of the seven principles of the individual is “resurrected” by the influence of the next higher principle. HPB’s sevenfold breakdown of human principles was presented variously as Chaldean, Tibetan, and Chaldeo- Tibetan. But in fact its closest historical analogue is Ismaili. 23 Blavatsky’s teachings also influenced the establishment of a prominent secret society known as the Golden Dawn, which would emerge out of Afghani’s contacts with the leaders of Egyptian Rite Freemasonry. Having gone underground for some time, until 1848, the “Year of Revolutions”, the Egyptian Rite of Freemasonry then revived its activity in Paris, and by 1856 had also established itself in Egypt, America, Romania, and other countries. In 1872, when the Egyptian Rite came to be known as the Antient and Primitive Rite, the Grand Mastership of the order was assumed by John Yarker, having been handed to him by Marconis de Negre. Yarker was also familiar with Blavatsky, having met her in England in 1878, and appears to have conferred on her a Masonic initiation, though there have been attempts to refute her involvement in Freemasonry. In Paris, Yarker met Pascal Beverly Randolph, an African-American occultist who had traveled to Egypt, where he was supposedly initiated by a secret priestess of the Ismaili Muslims. Paschal Randolph was a noted medium, healer, occultist and author of his day, and also counted among his personal friends Bulwer-Lytton. Randolph’s Brotherhood of Eulis claimed descent from the Rosicrucian Order, by charter of the “Supreme Grand Lodge of France”, and taught spiritual healing, western occultism and principals of race regeneration through forms of sex magic. Through Randolph, Yarker passed on the tradition of the Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor, that was reborn as the Hermitic Brotherhood of Light, a continuation of the Frates Lucis, or Asiatic Brethren. In 1873, Carl Kellner, an associate of Randolph, was another of the many occultists associated with Egyptian Freemasonry, who had traveled to Cairo in the time of al Afghani’s activity. There he met, for the first time, a mysterious young man, then going by the name of Aia Aziz, also known as"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 170 Max Theon. Actually, this Max Theon was the son of the last leader of the Frankist sect, Rabbi Bimstein of Warsaw, Poland. Max Theon traveled widely, and in Cairo worked with Blavatsky, and also became a student of Paulos Metamon, a “Coptic magician”. Paulos Metamon was also Blavatsky’s first “Master”, whom she had met in Asia Minor in 1848, and again in Cairo in 1870, and it was he who introduced her to the Hermetic Brotherhood of Light. Interestingly, the sevenfold cosmology of Ismailism was common to both Theon and Blavatsky. In 1873, Metamon passed the Grand Mastership to Aziz, who, adopting the name of Max Theon, moved to England to propagate the same order. It was Carl Kellner and Thoedore Reuss, another member of Bulwer- Lyttons’ Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia, who would put together the ritual of Egyptian Rite Freemasonry, chartered to Reuss by John Yarker, to convey the inner secret of the Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor. Regarding Kellner, Reuss wrote: In the course of his many and extensive travels in Europe, America and the Near East, Bro. Kellner came into contact with an organisation which called itself The Hermetic Brotherhood of Light. The stimulus which he received through his association with this body, as well as other circumstances which cannot be mentioned here, gave rise to Bro. Kellner’s wish to found a sort of Academia Masonica which would make it possible for questing brethren to become acquainted with all the existing Masonic degrees and systems. In the year 1895 Bro. Kellner had long discussions with Bro. Reuss in Berlin about how this idea of his could be realised. In the course of talks with Bro. Reuss he abandoned the proposed title Academia Masonica and produced reasons and documents for the adoption of the name Oriental Templars. At that time in 1895 these deliberations did not lead to any positive result because Bro. Reuss was then busy with his revived Order of the Illuminati and Bro. Kellner had no sympathy for this organisation or for the people who were active in it with Bro. Kellner. 24 It was John Yarker who supposedly provided a charter for the founding of the Ordo Templi Orientis, or O.T.O., effected by Reuss, which attempted to revive the traditions of the Ancient Mysteries, the Knights Templars, the Freemasons, Rosicrucians and the Illuminati. Ordo Templi Orientis meant “Order of Eastern Templars”, in reference to the Johannite myth of Sabian or Ismaili influence. The occult inner circle of the O.T.O. would be organized parallel to the highest degrees of Egyptian Rite Masonry, and the esoteric Rosicrucian doctrines of the H.B. of L. Reuss was succeeded as head of the O.T.O. by the notorious Aleister Crowley. Aleister Crowley, a thirty-third degree Mason of the Scottish Rite, had also been a member of the Isis-Urania Temple of Hermetic Students of the Golden Dawn. Known simply as The Golden Dawn, the order was founded in 1888, by Masons and members of the Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia of Bulwer-Lytton. This Isis Cult was organized around the 1877 manuscript Isis"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"The Salafi 171 Unveiled by Helena Blavatsky. The Order of the Golden Dawn included, among others, William Butler Yeats, Maude Gonne, wife of Oscar Wilde, and Arthur Edward Waite. The Golden Dawn was led at the time by McGreggor Mathers, who traced the spiritual ancestry of the order to the Rosicrucians, and from there, through to the Kabbalah and to Ancient Egypt. And, it was while in Egypt, in 1904, that Crowley made contact with an entity by the name of Aiwass, which dictated to him the content of his Book of the Law, containing the famous dictum of modern occultism, “Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.” The Salafi After Afghani’s departure from Egypt, his pupil, Mohammed Abduh, was inexplicably named the chief editor of the official British-controlled publication of the Egyptian government, the Journal Officiel. Working under him was fellow-Freemason, Saad Zaghul, later to be founder of the Wafd nationalist party. In 1883, Abduh joined Afghani in Paris, and then went to London, where he lectured at Oxford and Cambridge, and consulted with British officials about the crisis in Sudan against the Mahdi. In Paris and London, Abduh assisted Afghani in administering both a French-language and Arabic journal in Paris, called Al Urwah al Wuthkah, or the “Indissoluble Bond”, also the name of a secret organization he founded in 1883. Among the members of Afghani’s circle in Paris were Egyptians, Indians, Turks, Syrians, North Africans, as well as many Christians and Jews, and Persian Bahais expelled from the Middle East. When the French suppressed the Al-Murwah al-Wuthkah, Abduh traveled for several years, throughout the Arab world, under various disguises, particularly to Tunis, Beiruk, and Syria. In each city, he would recruit members into the secret society of Afghani’s fundamentalism. 25 Like his teacher, Abduh was associated with the Bahai movement, which had made deliberate efforts to spread the faith to Egypt. Bahais began establishing themselves in Alexandria and Cairo beginning in the late 1860. Abduh had met Abdul Baha when he was teaching in Beirut, and the two struck up a very warm friendship, and agreed with his one-world-religion philosophy. 26 Remarking on Abdul Baha’s excellence in religious science and diplomacy, Abduh said of him that, “[he] is more than that. Indeed, he is a great man; he is the man who deserves to have the epithet applied to him.” 27 Abduh was known for his reformist views about Islam. But, in How We Defended Orabi, A.M. Broadbent declared that, “Sheikh Abdu was no dangerous fanatic or religious enthusiast, for he belonged to the broadest school of Moslem thought, held a political creed akin to pure republicanism, and was a zealous Master of a Masonic Lodge.” 28 Like the Ismailis before him, he would advance his students progressively into deeper levels of heresy. To the higher initiates, he"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 172 would reveal the doctrines of the Scottish Rite and the philosophy of one-world government. However, for those Abduh deemed were much more disposed, he would introduce to an officer of British intelligence from London. 29 From 1888, until his death in 1905, Abduh regularly visited the home and office of Lord Cromer. In 1892, he was named to run the administrative Committee for the Al Azhar mosque and university, the most prestigious educational institution in Islam, and the oldest university in the world. From that post, he reorganized the entire Muslim system in Egypt, and because of Al Azhar’s reputation, much of the Islamic world as well. In 1899, Lord Cromer, made Abduh the Grand Mufti of Egypt. He was now the chief legal authority in Islam, as well as the Masonic Grand Master of the United Lodge of Egypt. Lord Cromer was an important member of England’s Baring banking family, that had grown rich off of the opium trade in India and China. His motive in making Abduh the most powerful figure in all of Islam was to change the law forbidding interest banking. Abduh then offered a contrived interpretation of the Koran, to create the requisite loophole, giving British banks free reign in Egypt. Of Abduh, Lord Cromer related, “I suspect my friend Abduh was in reality an agnostic,” and he said of Abduh’s Salafi reform movement that, “They are the natural allies of the European reformer.” 30 The Salafi movement then became allied with the Wahhabis of Saudi Arabia, through another Freemason, Mohammed Rashid Rida, who, after the death of Afghani in 1897, and Abduh in 1905, assumed the leadership of the Salafis, Rida had become a member of the Indissoluble Bond at a young age. He was promoted through Afghani’s Masonic society through his reading of Al-Urwah al Wuthkah, which he later confessed was the greatest influence in his life. Rida had never met Afghani, but in 1897, he had gone to Egypt to study with Mohammed Abduh. Though Rida did not share his master’s opinions about the Bahai movement, it was through his influence that the Salafi movement became firmly aligned with the State of Saudi Arabia."},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"173 Oil As executed by the Round Table organizations, the brunt of the Illuminati’s plan for the twentieth century depended significantly on the assistance of the Salafi intriguers, beginning with the destruction of the Ottoman Empire. More important still was the role-played by the puppet-state of Saudi Arabia, which became the sponsor of Salafi terrorism. The Saudis would become an important linchpin in the Illuminati strategy to make the world dependent on Rockefeller-controlled oil, thus not only increasing demand and profits, but enhancing their strangle-hold over the world’s governments and economies. The primary agent in this agenda was Winston Churchill. Winston Churchill was a descendant of the first famous member of the Churchill family, John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough. Churchill’s legal surname was Spencer-Churchill, as he was related to the Spencer family, though, starting with his father, Lord Randolph Churchill, his branch of the family used the name Churchill in his public life. Randolph Churchill’s mother, like his grandfather’s wife, and his great-grandfather’s wife, was a Stewart, also descended from James Douglas. Winston Churchill’s mother was Jennie Jerome, daughter of American Jewish millionaire Leonard Jerome. 1 Winston Churchill, a Scottish Rite Freemason, was eventually invested as Knight of the Order of the Garter. He was also a member of the Ancient Order of Druids, created by Wentworth Little, founder of the SRIA. 2 The famous “V for Victory” sign used by Churchill has been attributed to Aleister Crowley. At the request of his friend, naval intelligence officer Ian Fleming, creator of James Bond 007, Crowley provided Winston Churchill with valuable insights into the superstitions of the Nazis. Crowley suggested that Churchill exploit the Nazis’ magical paranoia by being photographed as much as possible giving the two-fingered “V for Victory” gesture, a powerful symbol of destruction and annihilation that, according to magical tradition, is capable of defeating the perverted solar energies represented by the Nazi swastika. 3 18 : World War One"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 174 ` As indicated in “The Rothchilds, Winston Churchill and the Final Solution”, by Clifford Shack, no naval issue would affect Britain’s foreign policy more than the crucial debate whether or not the Royal Navy should be converted from coal propulsion to oil. 4 Oil was not only superior to coal, but the French branch of the Rothschilds were, together with the Rockefellers, supreme rulers of the oil business, having entered into a world cartel with Standard Oil. Lord Nathaniel Mayer Rothschild was a keen proponent of increases in the strength of the Royal Navy, for in 1888, the London house of Rothschild had issued shares worth £225,000 for the Naval Construction and Armaments Company. However, in order to provide the pretext to legitimize Britain’s increased spending for naval construction, the Rothschilds fabricated the threat of Germany’s naval build-up in the late nineteenth century. On July 1, 1911, Kaiser Wilhelm, a Rothschild front-man, sent a gunboat, called the Panther, steaming into the harbor at Agadir, on the Atlantic coast of Morocco, which was perceived as a direct challenge to British global positions. Nathaniel Rothschild was an intimate friend of Lord Randolph Churchill, the father of Winston Churchill, who immediately after the Agadir crisis, was appointed First Lord of the Admiralty. 5 Churchill vowed to do everything he could to prepare Britain militarily for the “inescapable day of reckoning”. His charge was to ensure that the Royal Navy, the symbol of Britain’s imperial power, was to meet the German “challenge” on the high seas. According to Daniel Yergin’s Pulitzer prize winning book, The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money and Power: One of the most important and contentious questions he faced was seemingly technical in nature, but would in fact have vast implications for the twentieth century. The issue was whether to convert the British Navy to oil for its power source, in place of coal, which was the traditional fuel. Many thought that such a conversion was pure folly, for it meant that the Navy could no longer rely on safe, secure Welsh coal, but rather would have to depend on distant and insecure oil supplies from Persia, as Iran was then known. 6 The importance of guaranteeing a supply of oil for Britain’s navy had assumed centre stage, as oil had not yet been discovered in its Arab possessions in the Gulf. On June 17, 1914, Churchill introduced a bill proposing that the British government invest in an oil company, after which it acquired 51 percent of Anglo-Persian, which in actuality was already partially-owned by the British government, and was financed in part by the Rothschilds bank. Britain had acquired its first oil concession, and kept its involvement secret. By the summer of 1914, the British Navy was fully committed to oil and the British government had assumed the role of majority stockholder in Anglo- Persian. The company grew rapidly, first into Anglo-Iranian, and then finally into British Petroleum, or BP."},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":" World War One 175 Anglo-Persian was not to be Britain’s sole supplier of oil, as Churchill stated to Parliament in 1913, “On no one quality, on no one process, on no one country, on no one route and on no one field must we be dependent. Safety and certainty in oil lie in variety, and variety alone.” 7 Germany had already expanded toward Turkey and South into Africa. But, Germany’s move eastward was restricted by Britain’s control of important sea lanes. Therefore, Germany struck a deal with the Ottoman Empire to build a railway from Berlin to Baghdad. The Round Table was especially alarmed about this agreement, as it would provide direct German access to the Middle East oil, bypassing the Suez Canal controlled by the British. Britain had earlier precluded extension of the railway to the Persian Gulf by secretly concluding an agreement with the Sabah clan, of Kuwait, another family of secret Jews, related to the Saudis through the Anza tribe, to establish Kuwait as a “British protectorate”, thus effectively sealing it off from the Ottoman Empire. The last northern link of the railway was in Serbia. History books record that World War I started when the nations went to war to avenge the assassination of the Archduke Francis Ferdinand, the heir-apparent to the Habsburg throne of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. However, top-level officials of European Freemasonry met in Switzerland in 1912, during which it was decided to assassinate the Archduke Ferdinand, in order to bring about World War I. 8 The actual date on which the murder was to be committed was postponed, as the time was not yet considered appropriate. The act was finally committed on June 28, 1914, in Sarajevo, by members of a Serbian terrorist organization called the Black Hand, with ties to Freemasonry. The Austro-Hungarian Empire then declared war on Serbia, and WWI officially began. The Federal Reserve The further purpose of WWI was to create the preconditions for the Russian revolution of 1918, which was financed and orchestrated by Jacob Schiff, through Kuhn, Loeb & Company of New York, to overthrow the aristocracy. The result was to exact the Rothschilds’ revenge against Russian Czar Alexander I, for having thwarted their first attempt at world government at the Congress of Vienna in 1815. According to Albert Pike, the further aim was to transform Russia into a bastion of their atheistic communist creed, “to be built up and used to destroy other governments and weaken religion.” 9 When WWI was eventually mired in a stalemate at the fronts of Europe, the Illuminati used their agent President Woodrow Wilson to gain America’s entry into the war. Wilson’s friend and “alter ego” was Rothschild agent Col. Edward Mandell House. Col. House was a member of the Round Table, whose projects for the US included a graduated income tax, a central bank, creation of a Central Intelligence Agency, and the League of Nations."},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 176 According to the Col. E.M. House Report, a ten-page “progress report”, addressed to British Prime Minister David Lloyd George, Col. House details progress in preparing “for the peaceful return of the American colonies to the dominion of the Crown.” “Crown” refers, not to the Queen, but to the owners of the Bank of England. Col. House writes: “We have wrapped this plan in the peace treaty so that the world must accept from us the League or a continuance of the war. The League is in substance the Empire with America admitted on the same basis as our other colonies.” 10 In 1911, prior to Wilson’s taking office as President, House had returned to his home in Texas and completed a book called Philip Dru, Administrator. Ostensibly a novel, it was actually a detailed plan for the future government of the United States, “which would establish Socialism as dreamed by Karl Marx”, according to House. It was published anonymously by B. W. Huebsch of New York, and widely circulated among government officials, who were left in no doubt as to its authorship. The novel predicted the enactment of the graduated income tax, excess profits tax, unemployment insurance, social security, and a flexible currency system. In short, it was the blueprint which was later followed by the Woodrow Wilson and Franklin D. Roosevelt administrations. One of the institutions outlined in Philip Dru was the Federal Reserve System. The bankers had not been in a position to gain control of the issuance of money from the government of the United States, to whom it was designated through its Congress by the Constitution, until the Congress granted them their monopoly for a central bank. Therefore, much of the influence exerted to have the Federal Reserve Act passed was done behind the scenes, principally by two non-elected persons, Col. House and Paul Warburg, a Shabbatean, and representative of the Rothschild dynasty in France and England. 382 Effectively, the Federal System ceded the right to print money to what was merely a legalized cartel of private banks, affiliated with the Rothschilds in London, through the agency of the Warburgs, Rockefellers, Kuhn-Loeb, and J.P Morgan. House was responsible for Wilson’s campaign that promised to keep the US out of the war. However, when Wilson was presented with incriminating evidence of his illicit relationship with a former colleague, he was forced to comply with appointing Louis Dembitz Brandeis, to the Supreme Court. 12 Brandeis, a leading Frankist, was head of world Zionism, when the war forced the movement to move its headquarters to New York from Berlin. 13 Then, Wilson, Mandel House, J .P. Morgan and Winston Churchill conspired together to ensure that the passenger ship, the Lusitania, would be sunk by a German U-boat. 14 Finally, relying to a great extent upon the legal opinion of Justice Brandeis, President Wilson addressed both houses of Congress on April 2, 1917.

The Warburgs had reached their financial eminence during the years of the nineteenth century, with the growth of Kuhn, Loeb Company, with whom they stood in a personal union and family relationship. Also in the American delegation were Walter Lippman, and brothers Allen and John Foster Dulles. Lloyd George was accompanied by Sir Philip Sassoon, a member of the British Privy Council, and direct descendant of Amschel Rothschild. The advisor to Georges Clemenceau, the French Prime Minister, was Georges Mandel, also known as Jeroboam Rothschild. 15 Late in 1920, Churchill told Lloyd George that he wanted to move to another cabinet post. On February 14, 1921, Churchill was appointed Colonial Secretary. When he took over the Colonial Office, the Balfour declaration was part of his legacy. The text was prepared by Leo Amery, assistant secretary to the War Cabinet. Amery worked under the Rothschild front-man, Lord Milner, who was a member of the inner War Cabinet. The declaration was addressed to Nathan Mayer Rothschild’s son, Walter. The declaration proclaimed that the British government favored: The establishment of a national home for the Jewish people and will use their best endeavors to facilitate the achievement of that object, it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine. When negotiations at the Paris conference had been deviating from Illuminati designs for the Middle East, Jacob Schiff sent President Wilson a cable, that “instructed” him what to defend with regard to the Palestine Mandate, German reparations and other issues, in the name of the Association of the League of Free Nations. 16 The creation of the League of Nations became a centrepiece of Wilson’s “Fourteen Points” that he believed would, if made the basis of a postwar peace, prevent future wars, and was eventually accepted by the Paris conference. However, the intention of the Illuminati was also to prepare the preconditions leading to WWII, by making German acceptance of the terms intolerable. 17 Therefore, despite Wilson’s best efforts, the Treaty of Versailles, signed in June 1919, departed significantly from the Fourteen Points of Wilson, leaving both the Germans and many Americans bitterly disillusioned. Nevertheless, the League of Nations, headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, did achieve one important Illuminati objective when it officially recognized the Soviet regime of their agents the Bolsheviks. It was Churchill who divulged:"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 178 From the days of Spartacus Weishaupt, Karl Marx, Trotsky, Bela Kun, Rosa Luxemburg, and Ema Goldman, this world conspiracy has been steadily growing. This conspiracy played a definite recognizable role in the tragedy of the French revolution. It has been the mainspring of every subversive movement during the 19th Century. And now at last this band of extraordinary personalities from the underworld of the great cities of Europe and America have gripped the Russian people by the hair of their head and have become the undisputed masters of that enormous empire. 18 Largely because of the efforts of Sen. Henry Cabot Lodge, who saw through Wilson’s plan, the United States didn’t join the League, and in 1921, made a separate peace treaty with Germany and Austria. Weakened by the failure of the United States to join, and the dissatisfaction of nations such as Japan, Italy and Germany, the League failed. The League had little impact on international affairs, and ceased to exist in when the United Nations was established. The Illuminati then realized that America would not join any scheme for world government without a change in public opinion. Therefore, Round Table members Lionel Curtis, Balfour, Milner and others, formed the Royal Institute for International Affairs (RIIA), for the purpose of coordinating British and American efforts. Arnold Toynbee later became director. They also formed an American branch, known as the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), founded by Col. House, with Rockefeller family funding, and including members like J.P. Morgan, Paul Warburg, and Jacob Schiff. In Tragedy & Hope, late CFR member Carroll Quigley, stated, “The CFR is the American Branch of a society which originated in England, and which believes that national boundaries should be obliterated, and a one-world rule established.” Rear Admiral Chester Ward, for sixteen years a member of the CFR, warned of the organization’s ultimate intentions: The most powerful clique in these elitist groups have one objective in common — they want to bring about the surrender of the sovereignty of the national independence of the United States. A second clique of international members in the CFR comprises the Wall Street international bankers and their key agents. Primarily, they want the world banking monopoly from whatever power ends up in the control of global government. 19 Fall of the Ottoman Empire A further purpose of the WWI was to cause the destruction of the Ottoman Empire, in order to free the land of Palestine from its grasp, leading to the creation of the Zionist state of Israel. After Prime Minister of England, Lord Asquith, was deposed in 1916, because he had opposed Zionist interests, David Lloyd George,"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":" World War One 179 whose career was made as a lawyer for the World Zionist Organization, as well as Winston Churchill and Arthur Balfour of the Round Table, were placed in power. Present at the first official meeting of the Political Committee were Lord Rothschild, James de Rothschild, the son of Edmund de Rothschild of Paris, former owner of Rothschild colonies in Palestine, and Sir Mark Sykes. There, the future mandates of Palestine, Armenia, Mesopotamia, and Arabia, then still forming parts of the Ottoman Empire, were discussed in detail. 20 The Illuminati had also been agitating to undermine the Ottoman Empire from within. In Turkey, Jamal ud Din Al Afghani was part of the creation of a Masonic political party, modeled on the Carbonari, named the Committee of Union and Progress, or the Young Turks. From the middle of the nineteenth century, the British had worked to develop an alliance between several leading Sufi orders in Turkey, such as the Beqtashi and the Naqshabandi, and the Scottish Rite Freemasons of Afghani and his followers. It was this alliance, sponsored by the British, that became the Young Turks. 21 The Young Turks led a revolutionary movement against the crumbling regime of the Ottoman sultan, Abdul Hamid II, which culminated in the establishment of a constitutional government in 1908, and ruled the Ottoman Empire until the end of World War I, in November 1918. The preliminary, though unsuccessful military attack against the Ottoman Empire, was undertaken by Churchill, known as the Dardanelle campaign, aimed at taking Istanbul, the capital of the Empire. As Clifford Shack describes, however: For a variety of reasons, history views his campaign as a failure. In reality, however it was a crowning success for the war planners. For not only did the Dardanelle campaign spell the beginning for the end of the Ottoman empire, but the feigned bungling of the operation set in motion a series of orchestrated events that would empower the Turks to execute the Armenian genocide. Eliminating the Armenian presence in the Baku oil region eliminated the ethnic conflict between the region’s Moslem majority which actually interrupted the oil production in 1905, when the oil fields were set ablaze. 22 To further aggravate the situation against the Ottomans, Britain deceptively employed the assistance of Sharif Hussayn of Mecca, who belonged to the Hashimite dynasty, descendants of the Prophet, who had traditionally administered the Haramayn, or two holy precincts of Mecca and Medina. Sharif Hussayn was initially allied with the Ottomans and the Germans, but he was dismayed by the increasing discrimination against non-Turks of the Ottoman Empire by the Young Turks. He was finally convinced by the British that his assistance would be rewarded instead by the creation of an Arab empire, encompassing the entire span between Egypt and Persia, with the exception of imperial possesions and interests in Kuwait, Aden, and the Syrian coast. However, in accordance with the cunning duplicity that has always characterized their foreign policy, the British offered him assurances in"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 180 contradiction to the designs they had in mind. The British also renewed their special relationship with the Wahhabi sect, and its leader, Abdul Aziz ibn Saud. Following the collapse of the first Saudi insurgency at the hand of Mohammed Ali Pasha, the Wahhabi movement was largely reconstituted, but internal disputes over succession had brought about its demise in 1891 Ibn Saud’s father, Abdul- Rahman, fled with his family to Kuwait, leaving Riyadh under the occupation of the Ottomans. In January 1902, Ibn Saud led a raid to regain control of Riyadh. The British sought the support of Ibn Saud through the diplomatic aid of “Abdullah” St. John Philby, who supposedly converted to Wahhabi Islam, though he also doubled as a Nazi intelligence agent. In 1915, the British had signed with Ibn Saud a “treatise of friendship and cooperation”, to be supported with British financing. By 1917, the Saudi ruler was receiving five thousand pounds per month. Through the instigation of Lawrence of Arabia, Hussayn’s son Faisal led the Arab Revolt against the Ottomans. Faisal seized Damascus in 1918. Five days after the conquest of Damascus by Faisal’s forces, an armistice with the Ottoman Empire came into effect. The Ottoman government effectively collapsed, and the empire was divided amongst the victorious powers. France and Britain got control of most of the Middle East while Italy and Greece were given much of Anatolia. The Turkish people refused to accept this arrangement, however, and under Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the remnants of the Young Turk movement formed a government in Ankara, and created an army that forced the Greeks and Italians out of Anatolia, while the British and French refused to intervene. In Salonika in Greece, the heartland of Turkish Freemasonry, and the Young Turk movement, many Jews claimed that Ataturk was a “Doenmeh”, of the community of secret Jews descended from the followers of false messiah Shabbetai Zevi who converted to Islam. 23 And in 1923, when the Republic of Turkey was founded, it was Ataturk who was elected the republic’s first president. Then, in 1924, the Islamic Caliphate was formally abolished, bringing to an end thirteen centuries of consolidated Islamic rule. The victory of the Allied forces against the Ottoman Turks marked the beginning of the end of WWI, and the central powers one by one surrendered, signing an armistice on November 11, 1918. At the end of the war, Faisal continued his advance, and eventually took what is today Jordan, large parts of the Arabian peninsula and parts of southern Syria. However, unbeknownst to Hussayn, the British had secretly negotiated the Sykes-Picot agreement, to divide up the Middle East according to terms drawn up by Rothschild parties. Arbitrary divisions were created, which largely exist to the present, including the creation of Syria, and Lebanon as French “protectorates”. Hussayn was betrayed, and granted rule only over Iraq, which, along with Trans-Jordan, and Kuwait, were effectively British entities, as was Palestine, which was accorded to the Zionists. The mandate for Palestine was drafted by Felix Frankfurter, the prominent American Zionist, who afterwards became Chief Advisor in the"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":" World War One 181 White House to President Roosevelt, and also United States Supreme Court Justice, and helped found the ACLU. Frankfurter is reported to have received a copy of Eva Frank’s portrait from his mother, a descendent of the Prague Frankist family. 24 According to Frankfurter, “The real rulers in Washington are invisible and exercise their power from behind the scenes.” 25 Saudi Arabia By providing the excuse that Hussayn lacked disciplined fighting forces to be able to maintain the region, the British lent support to their agent Ibn Saud. Therefore, after WWI, with the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, and with British assistance, Ibn Saud and his Ikhwan, or “brotherhood”, the shock troops of Wahhabism, set out to conquer the entirety of the Peninsula. As described by Algar, in Wahhabism: A Critical Essay: Far from being spontaneous or autonomous development, the extension of Saudi control across the peninsula should therefore be placed in the context of the general reconfiguration of the Middle East that was then underway, largely under the charitable auspices of the British, ever generous with lands that were not theirs. It formed part of the same pattern as the division of the Arab lands of the Fertile Crescent into artificial units; the implantation of Zionism in Palestine under the protection of the British mandate; the establishment of the “secularist” Turkish Republic; and the rise of the Pahlavi dynasty in Iran. 26 This Wahhabi conquest of the Arabian peninsula, however, came at the cost of 400,000 killed and wounded. Cities such as Ta’if, Burayda, and al Hufa suffered all out massacres carried out by the Ikhwan. The governors of the various provinces appointed by Ibn Saud are said to have carried out 40,000 public executions and 350,000 amputations. Ibn Saud’s cousin, Abdullah ibn Musallim ibn Jilawi, the most brutal among the family, set about subjugating the Shiah population, by executing thousands. Nevertheless, after a visit to the newly conquered Arabian peninsula, Rashid Rida published a work praising Ibn Saud as the saviour of the Holy sites, a practitioner of authentic Islamic rule and, two years later, produced an anthology of Wahhabi treatises. Ultimately, the Salafi and Wahhabism shared common fundamentals. Primarily, a disdain for all developments in Islam subsequent to the first two generations of Muslims, or the Salaf as Salih, the repudiation of Sufism, and the abandonment of adherence to one of the Madhhabs, or four legal schools otherwise followed by all of Sunni Islam. 27 By 1924, the Wahhabis, through the instigation of “Abdullah” Philby, reconquered Mecca, and expelled the Hashimites. Ensuing protests to Wahhabi vandalism and cruelty rang out throughout the Muslim world, but in 1926, Ibn"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 182 Saud called an international conference to ratify his control of the Haramayn. And, finally, in 1932, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was officially created, with British sanction. Even long before he had become King, the English monarch knighted Ibn Saud, and bestowed upon him the Order of the Bath, an order of chivalry founded by George I, the grandson of Frederick Elector of the Palatinate, and the highest honor accorded to nonroyalty. Through the assistance of Jack Philby, Allen Dulles, a former president of the CFR, who would later head the CIA, then working for the firm of Sullivan & Cromwell, helped the Rockefeller oil companies gain Saudi Arabia, which would be the world’s single greatest oil resource, accounting for nearly half of total oil production. 28 In 1933, the Saudis granted oil concessions to California Arabian Standard Oil Company (CASOC), affiliate of Standard Oil of California, (Socal, today’s Chevron), headed by John D. Rockefeller Jr., of the Round Table, and a founding members of the CFR. In 1936, Socal and the Texas Oil Company had created a partnership, which would later be named Aramco, or the Arabian-American Oil Company. To Socal and Texaco were added the Standard of New Jersey and Socony- Vacuum, the predecessors of Exxon Mobil. The Aramco partners, along with British Petroleum (BP), Royal Dutch Shell, and Gulf Oil combined as a cartel to control the price of oil, known collectively as the Seven Sisters. With the Saudi royal family, they controlled the world’s largest source of petroleum. In 1945, Roosevelt met with Ibn Saud aboard the USS Quincy in Egypt, to forge an important US-Saudi economic alliance. Roosevelt had acted on the advice of Harold Ickes, then Petroleum Coordinator for National Defense, and a State Department which in December 1942 had noted, “It is our strong belief that the development of Saudi Arabian petroleum resources should be viewed in the light of the broad national interest.” 29 The Saudis, however, would be unable to concede to Roosevelt’s request to approve increased Jewish settlement in Palestine, due to the precarious task the Saudis had adopted for themselves, of pretending to defend Islam, though also supporting American interests in the region, and refraining the rest of the Arab world from aggressive action against Israel. Under the stipulated conditions, American military and technical personnel would be admitted to Saudi Arabia. A US Air Force base was built at Dharan in 1946. Britain however, retained the major responsibility of maintaining Western security interests for another decade. In return, the Saudis declared war on the Axis powers, doing so within a month of the meeting with Roosevelt, and were allowed to be included in the founding conference of the U.N."},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"183 The Nazis Those secret societies that developed from the Asiactic Brethren, and preserving the doctrines and rituals of the Shabbeteans, divided in two directions. The first, was the Freemasonry in Egypt, and resulting in the Salafi movement. The second was those principal occult societies of the Occult Revival of the late nineteenth century. However, these two divergent lines would continue to collaborate. Specifically, the European arm of this tradition would culminate in the creation of the Nazis, who would then collaborate, throughout the twentieth century, with their counterparts in the Middle East, the Salafi, to participate in the propagation of terrorism on behalf of the Illuminati. Like the Salafi, the Nazis were also a principal component in the execution of Illuminati strategy, in their case, towards the creation of World War II. In accord with the plan worked out by Albert Pike, and summarized by William Guy Carr, the plan for WWII “was to be fomented by using the differences between Fascists and Political Zionists. This was to be fought so that Nazism would be destroyed and the power of Political Zionism increased so that the sovereign state of Israel could be established in Palestine.” 1 Therefore, the harsh terms imposed by the agents of the Illuminati at the Treaty of Versailles, that ruined Germany financially, were to set the stage for World War II. These harsh economic conditions created the situation in which a leader like Hitler could arise, a leader promoted to power by Illuminati backers. It was Montagu Norman, as Chairman of the Bank of England, who, from 1933 through 1939, met repeatedly with Hjalmar Schacht, Reich Minister of Economics, and a member of the Rhodes Round Table, to plan the overall budget of the Nazi regime with British credit, and guided the strategies of Hitler’s primary supporters, the Rockefellers, Warburgs, and Harrimans. While Hitler cynically denounced the company as an “international Jewish organization,” Schacht nevertheless awarded huge contracts to produce munitions and chemicals for the German military buildup to IG Farben, the giant chemical firm, that ultimately produced the Zyklon B gas used in Nazi extermination camps. And, IG Farben and Rockefeller’s Standard Oil of New 19 : The Muslim Brotherhood"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 184 Jersey were effectively a single firm, having been merged in hundreds of cartel arrangements. It was led, up until 1937 by Rockefeller’s partners, the Frankist Warburgs. 2 After WW II began, Standard Oil pledged to keep the merger with I.G. Farben, even if the U.S. entered the war. In addition, the Nazi party was thoroughly an occult organization. The Nazis were the result of a merging of the O.T.O of Crowley and the Thule Gesselschaft of Germany. The chief architect of the Thule group was Baron Rudolf von Sebottendorff, who had contact with Dervish Orders, and knew much about Sufism. The doctrines of the Thule order were founded on The Coming Race by the Bulwer-Lytton, and the theory of the Atlantean origins of the Aryans race developed by Blavatsky. In 1919, the members of the Thule Society formed a political party named the “Germany Workers Party”. They were in turn later renamed the “National Socialist German Workers’ Party”, more popularly known as the Nazis, by Adolph Hitler in 1920, who became Chancellor of Germany in 1933 and dictator in 1934. Also a member of the Thule Society was black magician, Heinrich Himmler, leader of the SS, whose insignia was a Runic symbol, thought to represent the lost wisdom of their supposed Aryan forefathers. The Muslim Brotherhood The fruit of the shared occult knowledge of the two factions that developed out of Afghani’s influence, the Nazis and the Salafis, would work together to revive the ancient mind-control tactics of the Ismailis, to form a body of agent- provocateurs, more commonly known as terrorists. The name of the organization is the Muslim Brotherhood. Ultimately, following the example set by Afghani and Abduh, the upper leadership of the Muslim Brotherhood would profess Islam only to deceive. In truth, their true faith was the Gnostic cult of the Ismailis, through which they shared a common history with their occult brethren in the West. Thus, as Robert Dreyfuss described, in Hostage to Khomeini, a revealing look at the conspiracy to promote the Muslim Brotherhood: The Muslim Brotherhood is a London creation, forged as the standard-bearer of an ancient, anti-religious (pagan) heresy that has plagued Islam since the establishment of the Islamic community (umma) by the Prophet Mohammed in the seventh century. Representing organized Islamic fundamentalism, the organization called the Muslim Brotherhood (Ikhwan al-Muslimum in Arabic) was officially founded in Egypt, in 1929, by the British agent Hasan al-Banna, a Sufi mystic. Today, the Muslim Brotherhood is the umbrella under which a host of fundamentalist Sufi, Sunni, and radical Shiite brotherhoods and societies flourish. 3 The founder of the Muslim Brotherhood was a Freemason, named Hassan al Banna, born in 1906, who developed from the influence of the three"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"The Muslim Brotherhood 185 Salafi reformers, Afghani, Abduh and Rida. Banna’s father was as student of Abduh, while Banna himself was greatly influenced by Rashid Rida. By age twenty-one, Banna was introduced to the leadership of Al-Manar, founded by Rida, and, beginning in the early 1920s, would often meet and discuss with Rida. Through Rida, Banna developed his opposition to Western influence in Egypt, in favor of “pure Islam”, meaning to the pernicious version of Wahhabism. When Hitler came to power in the 1930’s, he and Nazi intelligence made contact with al Banna to see if they could work together. 4 Banna was also a devout admirer of Hitler. Banna’s letters to Hitler were so supportive that he and other members of the Brotherhood, were recruited by Nazi Military Intelligence to provide information on the British and work covertly to undermine British control in Egypt. Banna himself said that he had “considerable admiration for the Nazi Brownshirts” and organized his own forces along fascist lines. 5 Banna’s Brotherhood also collaborated with the overtly fascist “Young Egypt” movement, founded in October 1933, by lawyer Ahmed Hussein, and modeled directly on the Hitler party, complete with paramilitary Green Shirts, aping the Nazi Brown Shirts, Nazi salute and literal translations of Nazi slogans. Among its members, Young Egypt counted two later presidents, Gamal Nasser and Anwar Sadat. The Islamo-Fascists A key individual in the Islamo-fascist nexus, and go-between for the Nazis and Banna, became the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Hajj Amin al Husseini, later the mentor of Yasser Arafat, from 1946 onward. Hajj Amin al Husseini was convicted in absentia after fleeing to Syria for his involvement in the 1920 attack on Jews at the Western Wall. However, despite his involvement and conviction, he was pardoned by the local British High Commissioner Herbert Samuel, and made the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem in 1921. Beginning in 1933, al Husseini regularly met with local Nazi representatives and openly expressed admiration for Hitler’s ideas. During these meetings, he served as a liaison for the Muslim Brotherhood to the Nazis. Between 1936-1939, Adolf Eichmann, oversaw funding from the SS to al Husseini and his associates, to aid their efforts in encouraging a revolt in the region. 6 However, in the late 1930’s, al Husseini openly called for direct aide from Germany to Arab forces, and had to flee to Syria. In April 1941, al Husseini assisted the pro-Nazi revolt in Iraq, and attempts by the Syrian Social Nationalist Party, or the Syrian Nazi Party, to support the revolt after the British moved to suppress it. Those involved included Saddam’s uncle Khairallah Tulfah, and the Syrian Social Nationalist Party, who formed the Baath Parties of Syria and Iraq. 7"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 186 Thus, the mufti was to flee once again, ultimately reaching Berlin, to a hero’s welcome. He remained in Germany as an honored guest and valuable intelligence asset throughout most of the war, met with Hitler on several occasions, and personally recruited leading members of the Bosnian-Muslim “Hanjar” division of the Waffen SS. One member was Alija Izetbegovic, who later lead Bosnia’s move for independence. 8 In the summer of 1942, when German General Erwin Rommel’s Afrikakorps were poised to march into Cairo, Anwar Sadat, Gamal Nasser and their cronies were in touch with the attacking German force and, with help from the Muslim Brotherhood were preparing an anti-British uprising in Egypt’s capital. 9 A treaty with Germany had been drafted by Sadat, which included provisions for German recognition of an independent, but pro-Axis Egypt, and guarantying that “no British soldier would leave Cairo alive.” When Rommel’s push failed in the fall of 1942, Sadat and several of his co-conspirators were arrested by the British, and sat out much of the remainder of the war in jail. After the defeat of Nazi Germany, al Husseini fled to Egypt. His arrival in 1946 was a precursor to a steady stream of Third Reich veterans. Cairo became a safe haven for several thousand Nazi fugitives, including former SS Captain Alois Brunner, Adolf Eichmann’s chief deputy. Convicted in absentia for war crimes, Brunner would later reside in Damascus, where he served as a security advisor for the Syrian government. Several of the Germans, recognizing British puppet King Farouk’s political weakness, soon began conspiring with Nasser and his “Free Officers,” who, in turn, were working closely with the Muslim Brotherhood, to overthrow the king. When Banna was assassinated by Egyptian officials in 1949, the movement was destabilized, but not for long. On July 23, 1952, a coup d’etat was carried out by the Free Officers with Brotherhood assistance. Newsweek marveled that, “The most intriguing aspect [of] the revolt ... was the role played in the coup by the large group of German advisors serving with the Egyptian army... The young officers who did the actual planning consulted the German advisors as to ‘tactics’... This accounted for the smoothness of the operation.” 10 The Odessa Network Assisting the Egyptians in coordinating with the Nazis was the CIA, headed by Allen Dulles. A 33rd Degree Freemason and Knight Templar, Allen Dulles was also a founding member of the CFR, an in-law of the Rockefellers, Chairman of the Board of the Rockefeller Foundation, and Board Chairman of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Prior to working for the CIA, Dulles was as a director of the J. Henry Schroeder bank in London, a prime instrument employed by Montagu Norman in his support of Nazi of Germany. Allen’s brother John Foster Dulles can be credited for having created the Versailles Treaty’s harsh"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"The Muslim Brotherhood 187 terms against Germany. And yet, it was the two of them who secretly went to Hitler to confirm that the Illuminati bankers would back his rise to power. As partners in the Sullivan and Cromwell firm, Allen and John Foster also represented I.G. Farben, the Rockefeller-Harriman-Warburg combination. 11 Allen Dulles served with the U.S. Office of Strategic Services (OSS), a Round Table creation that would eventually become the CIA, and of which he would become head. In 1938, US president Franklin Delano Roosevelt executed a secret agreement with British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, which in effect ceded U.S. sovereignty to England, by agreeing to let the Special Operations Executive (SOE) control U.S. policies. To implement this agreement, Roosevelt sent General “Wild Bill” Donovan to London before setting up the OSS under the aegis of SOE-MI6. The entire OSS program, as well as the CIA, have since worked on guidelines set up by the Tavistock Institute. 12 Miles Copeland, a former CIA operative specializing in the Middle East, revealed in his autobiography, The Game Player, that in 1951 and 1952 the CIA became interested in Nasser through a project known secretly as “The Search for a Moslem Billy Graham.” According to Copeland, who activated the project in 1953, the CIA needed a charismatic leader in order to divert the growing anti-American hostility that was dominant at the time. Copeland describes the first secret meeting he had with three army officers, including Major Abdel Moneim Ra’ouf, of Gamal Abdun Nasser’s inner circle. In March 1952, Kermit “Kim” Roosevelt, grandson of President Roosevelt, who headed the CIA Near East Operations, had begun a series of meetings with Nasser that led to the coup four months later. When Nasser wanted to overhaul Egypt’s secret service, he turned to the CIA. However, the U.S. government “found it highly impolitic to help [Nasser] directly,” Copeland recalled in his memoirs, so the CIA instead secretly bankrolled more than a hundred Nazi espionage and military experts to train Egyptian police and army units in the mid-1950s. 13 Allen Dulles turned to Reinhard Gehlen, the most senior eastern front military intelligence officer, who, just before the end of WWII, had turned himself over to the U.S. In exchange for his extensive intelligence contacts in the USSR, Dulles and the OSS, reunited Gehlen with his Nazi associates, to establish “the Gehlen Organization”, which then functioned within the OSS, and later the CIA. 14 Gehlen handpicked 350 former German army and SS officers who were released from internment camps. That number eventually grew into 4000 undercover agents, called V-men. The more notorious of these henchmen included Gestapo captain Klaus Barbie, otherwise known as the “Butcher of Lyon”, Alois Brunner, Adolf Eichmann’s right-hand man in orchestrating the Final Solution, and Emil Augsburg, who directed the Wannsee Institute, where the Final Solution was formulated, and who served in a unit that specialized in the extermination of Jews. Another was the former Gestapo chief Heinrich"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 188 Muller, Adolf Eichmann’s immediate superior, whose signature appears on orders written in 1943 for the deportation of 45,000 Jews to Auschwitz for killing. By the early 1950s, Reinhard Gehlen was in charge of developing the new German intelligence service. To build Egypt’s spy and security forces, Gehlen hired the best man he knew for the job, former SS colonel Otto Skorzeny, who was described by the OSS, as “the most dangerous man in Europe”. It was Skorzeny who, at the end of the war, organized the infamous ODESSA network, the purpose of which was to establish and facilitate secret escape routes, called ratlines, out of Germany to South America and the Middle East for hunted members. With ties to Argentina, Egypt, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, and the Vatican, they operated out of Buenos Aires and helped Adolf Eichmann, Josef Mengele, Erich Priebke, Aribert Heim and many other war criminals find refuge in Latin America and the Middle East. According to Nazi-hunter Serge Klarsfeld of Paris, it was the banking contacts of Francois Genoud that set in motion the ODESSA networks, which transferred millions of marks from Germany into Swiss banks. 15 According to European press accounts, Genoud was managing the hidden Swiss treasure of the Third Reich, most of which had been stolen from Jews. 416 Genoud later employed these funds to pick up the tab for the legal defense of Adolf Eichmann, Klaus Barbie, and Carlos the Jackal. Genoud had traveled to Palestine on behalf of the Nazis, when Adolf Eichmann was providing financial assistance from the SS to al-Husseini, with whom he developed a lifelong friendship. It is also likely that Genoud had some part in al-Husseini’s escape from Europe, as he was a representative of the Swiss Red Cross at the end of the war. 17 Through the same ratlines, Dulles also orchestrated an operation in Italy, known as “Stay-Behind”, to build a Europe wide secret network of anti- communist terrorists, who would fight behind the lines in the event of a Soviet invasion. The plan was later codified under the umbrella of the Clandestine Co-ordinating Committee of the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE), the military arm of NATO. US planners, worried over the growing influence of Italy’s large and popular communist party, organized the Stay- Behind” network into what was called Operation “Gladio” in 1956. The name derived from the short sword used by Roman. In addition to the CIA, Gladio was also operated by the secret Masonic lodge “Propaganda Due”, also known as P2, headed by Licio Gelli, known as the “Puppet-master”. During the war, Gelli had been a member of Mussolini’s notorious “Black shirts”, and later acted as liaison officer to the Hermann Goering SS division. 18 Also involved in the Nazi smuggling operations was George Herbert Walker, maternal grandfather of George H.

The Bush family are descendants of several prominent English families, like the Pierces and the Groverners, who trace their descent to the Fisher King, Alain IV Duke of Brittany. 20 However, the U.S. government investigated both Bert Walker and Prescott Bush, and under the Trading with the Enemy Act, seized all shares of Union Banking, including shares held by Prescott Bush, because “huge sections of Prescott Bush’s empire had been operated on behalf of Nazi Germany and had greatly assisted the German war effort.” 21 The German chemical company I.G. Farben also directly financed Joseph Mengele’s experiments at Auschwitz. 422 In 1940-41, I.G. Farben built a gigantic factory at Auschwitz in Poland, to utilize the Standard Oil-IG Farben patents with concentration camp slave labor to make gasoline from coal. The SS, who were paid by Standard Oil funds, guarded the Jewish and other inmates and selected for killing those who were unfit for I.G. Farben slave labor. 23 Mengele was among the hundreds of high-ranking Nazis which the US intelligence and military services extricated from Germany, during and after the final stages of World War II, known as Operation Paperclilp. Of particular interest were scientists specialising in aerodynamics and rocketry, such as those involved in the V-1 and V-2 projects, chemical weapons, chemical reaction technology and medicine. However, Christopher Simpson shows how the CIA hired former Nazis “for their expertise in propaganda and psychological warfare,” and other purposes. 24 According to the author of Mind Control The Ultimate Terror , it was through Mengele that the MK-Ultra and Monarch programs were developed. The project was begun in the 1950s, and coordinated by the British psychological warfare unit called the Tavistock Institute, with the Scottish Rite Freemasons, the CIA, and other British, American, Canadian, and UN agencies. 25 The Tavistock Institute, formed at Oxford University, London, by the RIIA in 1922, became the Psychiatric Division of the British Army during World War II. 26 The plan was to employ the age-old indoctrination methods of the Ismaili Assassins, to continue to create mind-controlled agent-provocateurs, more commonly known as “terrorists”. In 1952, Dulles founded Banque Commerciale Arabe in Lausanne, Switzerland, representing a pact between the"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 190 CIA and the Muslim Brotherhood, which is comprised of Saudi royal family members. 427 The bank was co-founded by a longtime British intelligence agent, Benoist Mechin, a protégé of Jack Philby. 28 Dean Henderson, author of Geopolitics: The Global Economy of Big Oil, Weapons and Drugs, summarizes the nature of this relationship: Part of this Faustian bargain may have involved the House of Saud chieftains providing information to US intelligence on how to create mind-controlled assassins. The Muslim Brotherhood claims to have first perfected this technique during the 11th century Crusades when it launched a brutal parallel secret society known as the Assassins, who employed mind-controlled “lone gunmen” to carry out political assassinations of Muslim Saracen nationalists. The Assassins worked in concert with Knights Templar Christian invaders in their attacks on progressive Arabs, but were repelled. 29 The ostensible reason for MK-Ultra, incepted by then director of the CIA, Dulles, in 1953, was to counteract the mind-control capabilities of the communists. This concern was largely based on the fact that U.S. prisoners captured during the Korean War were coerced into signing false confessions of crimes, and some had defected to North Korea, because of the effects of brainwashing. However, The Manchurian Candidate, a 1959 book, which was made into a movie in 1962, explains the true intended purpose. The film features a communist plot to use a U.S. soldier brainwashed in Manchuria to assassinate the leading U.S. presidential candidate. The CIA would employ the expertise of former Nazis in mind-control to program assassins for home- grown operations, but ultimately, members of Islamic fundamentalist groups to carry out acts of terrorism. The Muslim World League With Skorzeny now on the job of assisting Nasser, Egypt became a safe haven for Nazi war criminals. 30 Ultimately, the Free Officers coup was the work of many foreign intelligence agencies, though especially the British, French and American, in collusion with the Muslim Brotherhood. However, tensions eventually grew between the Free Officers and the Brotherhood. Nasser emerged in 1954, naming himself prime minister, and when his government moved towards a confrontation with the British, the Brotherhood was directed to wage war against him. To that effect, the Brotherhood received assistance from Israeli intelligence, for which reason, among others, it was accused by Al Ahram, and other Egyptian press, as being the tool of imperialists “and the Zionists”. 31 So when Nasser threatened to nationalize the Suez Canal, so important as a conduit for oil cargo to Europe and elsewhere, the Rothschilds employed their assassins from the Muslim Brotherhood against him. The Rothschilds"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"The Muslim Brotherhood 191 had maintained an interest in the canal, ever since Baron Lionel de Rothschild financed his friend’s Benjamin Disraeli’s purchase of the canal for the British government in 1875. When Brotherhood members fired shots at Egyptian leader Gamal Abdun Nasser in 1954, the group was forcibly suppressed by the government, with thousands of members being imprisoned. Six of its leaders were tried and executed for treason, and many others were imprisoned. Interrogations revealed that the Muslim Brotherhood functioned virtually as a German Intelligence unit. As well, as divulged by Copeland: Nor was that all. Sound beatings of the Moslem Brotherhood organizers who had been arrested revealed that the organization had been thoroughly penetrated, at the top, by the British, American, French and Soviet intelligence services, any one of which could either make active use of it or blow it up, whichever best suited its purposes. Important lesson: fanaticism is no insurance against corruption; indeed, the two are highly compatible. 32 The CIA also became concerned over his leanings towards the Soviet Union. Great Britain and the United States had originally agreed to help finance the first stage of the Nasser’s Aswan High Dam project. Although, in 1956, the U.S. secretary of state, John Foster Dulles, canceled the U.S. offer, and the next day Britain followed suit. Five days later, Nasser announced the nationalization of the Suez Canal, promising that the tolls Egypt collected would in five years pay for the dam. In response to Nasser’s nationalization of the Canal, the United Kingdom and France, with the help of Israel, invaded the Sinai and much of Port Said, sending the Egyptian military into retreat. However, due to pressure from both the United States and the Soviet Union, the British and the French had to withdraw. Though Israel did achieve the cessation of Egyptian raids, Nasser was hailed as having achieved a victory for the Arab world. Fleeing members of the Muslim Brotherhood were then shuttled to the CIA’s ally, Saudi Arabia. When John Loftus, a Justice Department official in the eighties, was permitted to peruse classified government documents, he discovered that the British Secret Service convinced American intelligence that the Arab Nazis of the Muslim Brotherhood would be indispensable as “freedom fighters” in preparation for the next major war, which was anticipated against the Soviet Union. Kim Philby, the Soviet agent who infiltrated the British Secret Service, and the son of “Abdullah” Philby, helped the US acquire these Arab Nazis, then being expelled from Egypt, who were afterwards sent to Saudi Arabia. There, according to Loftus, “they were given jobs as religion education instructors.” 33 Thus, beginning in the 1960s, the Salafi became more formally allied to the Wahhabis, who became the principal patrons of the Brotherhood, which set up branches in most Arab states. With the CIA’s tacit approval, the Saudis provided"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 192 funds for Brotherhood members who joined the anti-Nasser insurgency in Yemen in 1962. “Like any other truly effective covert action, this one was strictly off the books,” wrote Robert Baer, a nineteen-year veteran of the CIA, in Sleeping with the Devil. “There was no CIA funding, no memorandum of notification to Congress. Not a penny came out of the Treasury to fund it. In other words, no record.” Describing the Brotherhood as a “silent ally” that provided a “cheap no-American casualties way” to do “our dirty work in Yemen, Afghanistan, and plenty of other places,” Baer explained, “All the White House had to do was give a wink and a nod to countries harboring the Muslim Brothers.” 34 In 1962, with CIA encouragement, the Saudis established an organization called the Muslim World League. 35 Underwritten initially by several donors, including Aramco, then a CIA collaborator, the League established a powerful international presence, with representatives in 120 countries. 36 It was headed by then chief Mufti of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed ibn Ibrahim Al al-Sheikh, a lineal descendant of Mohammed ibn Abdul Wahhab, and the presidency remains vested in the Saudi Mufti to this day. Included among its eight members were important representatives of the Salafi Muslim Brotherhood: Said Ramadan, son-in-law of Hasan al Banna, Maulana Abul Ala Maududi, leader of Brotherhood offshoot, the Jamati Islami of Pakistan, and Maulana Abul Hasan Nadvi, of India. “Moreover”, as Abul El Fadl describes, ...the proponents of Wahhabism refused to be labeled or categorized as the followers of any particular figure including ‘Abd al-Wahhab himself. Its proponents insisted that they were simply abiding by the dictates of al- salaf al-salih (the rightly-guided predecessors, namely the Prophet and his companions), and in doing so, Wahhabis were able to appropriate the symbolism and categories of Salafism. 37 Nevertheless, as El Fadl mentions, “even with the formation of the Saudi state, Wahhabism remained a creed of limited influence until the mid-1970’s when the sharp rise in oil prices, together with aggressive Saudi proselytizing, dramatically contributed to its wide dissemination in the Muslim world. 38 This opportunity presented itself in 1967, when Israeli forces routed a coalition of Arab states, including Saudi Arabia, in the Six Day War. Israel then seized control of Jerusalem, the West Bank of the Jordan River, the Gaza Strip, the Sinai Peninsula, and the Golan Heights. In consequence, a summit of Arab leaders met, who resolved to employ their oil wealth to help confront Israel."},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"193 Population Control The essential Illuminati plot of the late twentieth century was a large-scale agenda that involved several components. The first two world wars were to be followed by a third, against the Muslim World. Despite the diversion of the supposed Cold War, much of its nuances were directed a preparing the stage for this third and final war. Essentially, the scheme involved increasing the power of the West, at the detriment of the so-called Third World, to secure its dominance. This strategy was accomplished by increasing its wealth through its monopoly on oil, based on the collaboration of the Saudi family, and the steady impoverishment of the Third World, to secure its power, towards to the establishment of a single global world order. The underlying philosophy of this strategy is known as Malthusianism, and was implemented through the activities of the Round Table, through their sponsorship of the Fabian Socialist Society of England. The Fabians were a group of socialists whose strategy differed from that of Karl Marx in that they sought world domination through what they called the “doctrine of inevitability of gradualism.” This meant their goals would be achieved “without breach of continuity or abrupt change of the entire social issue,” by infiltrating educational institutions, government agencies, and political parties. Prominent Fabian and writer, George Bernard Shaw, revealed that their goal was to be achieved by “stealth, intrigue, subversion, and the deception of never calling socialism by its right name.” 1 George Bernard Shaw’s mistress, Florence Farr, was a witch in the Order of the Golden Dawn, and the Fabian society was also an integral partner with the Golden Dawn, itself basically an extension of the Theosophical society. 2 When Blavatsky passed away in 1891, leadership of the worldwide theosophical movement passed to Annie Besant. Through her membership in the Fabian socialists, she became close friends with its leading members, which included men like H.G. Wells, Aldous and Julian Huxley, and Bertrand Russell. The Malthusian philosophy originates with Thomas Parson Malthus, who was a professor of political economy with the British East India Company’s East India College at Haileybury. His father was a personal friend of David 20 : Petrodollars"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 194 Hume, and an acquaintance of Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Malthus’ father was a disciple of Marie-Jean Condorcet, of the French Illuminati. His father also introduced him to the ideas of William Godwin, friend of Illuminati member, and inspiration to Hegel, Franz von Baader. It was in response to the “perfectibility of society” thesis then being advanced by Godwin and Condorcet, that Malthus’s decided to set his ideas down on paper. It was eventually published in 1798, as a pamphlet known as the Essay on Population. According to Malthus, “population, when unchecked, increases in a geometrical ratio. Subsistence increases only in an arithmetic ratio.” Therefore, Malthus concluded that society should adopt certain social policies to prevent the human population from growing disproportionately larger than the food supply. Among the genocidal policies promoted by Malthus were: Instead of recommending cleanliness to the poor, we should encourage contrary habits. In our towns we should make the streets narrower, crowd more people into the houses, and court the return of the plague. In the country, we should build our villages near stagnant pools, and particularly encourage settlement in all marshy and unwholesome situations. But above all, we should reprobate specific remedies for ravaging diseases; and those benevolent, but much mistaken men, who have thought they were doing a service to mankind by projecting schemes for the total extirpation of particular disorders. 3 Lord Bertrand Russell believed the white population of the world would soon cease to increase, and therefore would “have to defend themselves by methods which are disgusting even if they are necessary.” For Russell, population control was a prerequisite to World Government: I have already spoken of the population problem, but a few words must be added about its political aspect. .... It will be impossible to feel that the world is in a satisfactory state until there is a certain degree of equality, and a certain acquiescence everywhere in the power of the World Government, and this will not be possible until the poorer nations of the world have become ... more or less stationary in population. The conclusion to which we are driven by the facts that we have been considering is that, while great wars cannot be avoided until there is a World Government, a World Government cannot be stable until every important country has nearly stationary population. 4 Aldous and Julian Huxley were the grandsons of Thomas H. Huxley. Known as “Darwin’s Bulldog”, for his defense of evolutionary theory, he also coined the term “agnosticism” to describe his religious belief. He was also a founder of the Round Table, and a lifelong collaborator of Arnold Toynbee. Toynbee himself sat on the RIIA, headed the Research Division of British intelligence throughout WW II, and served as wartime briefing officer for British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. Trained at Toynbee’s Oxford, Aldous"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"Petrodollars 195 Huxley, author of Brave New World, was a member of the Children of the Sun, a Dionysian cult, comprised of the children of Britain’s Round Table elites. Among others were T.S. Eliot, W.H. Auden, Sir Oswald Mosley, and D.H. Lawrence. 5 H.G. Wells, head of British foreign intelligence during World War I, was also a founding member of Rhodes and Milner’s Round Table, and tutored Aldous and Julian Huxley at Oxford. It was also Wells who had first introduced the Huxley brothers to Aleister Crowley during the late 1920s. 6 The Open Conspiracy, Wells wrote: ...will appear first, I believe, as a conscious organization of intelligent and quite possibly in some cases, wealthy men, as a movement having distinct social and political aims, confessedly ignoring most of the existing apparatus of political control, or using it only as an incidental implement in the stages, a mere movement of a number of people in a certain direction who will presently discover with a sort of surprise the common object toward which they are all moving... In all sorts of ways they will be influencing and controlling the apparatus of the ostensible government. 7 Sir Julian Huxley, who became a British scientist and intellectual, and who played a leading part in creating the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), also held much the same views. Basically, Julian Huxley saw scientific advancement, such as penicillin, DDT and water purification, as a two-edged sword. He wrote, “We can and should devote ourselves with truly religious devotion to the cause of ensuring greater fulfillment for the human race in its future destiny. And this involves a furious and concerted attack on the problem of population; for the control of population is... a prerequisite for any radical improvement in the human lot.” 8 These repugnant opinions were held even by some of the most important managers of the global financial institutions. Fritz Lutweiler, the chairman of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the world banking headquarters, has said, “it means the reduction of real income in countries where the majority of the population is already living at the minimum existence level or even under it. That is difficult, but one cannot spare the highly indebted countries this difficult path. It is unavoidable.” 9 The BIS was later joined by the World Bank and International Monenatary Fund (IMF). The World Bank and IMF, both private entities with shareholders, owned largely by the Rothschild and Rockefeller families, were created in 1944, at a UN sponsored monetary conference in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire. The theoreticians who drafted the plan were prominent Fabian Socialists from England, like John Maynard Keynes, and the Assistant Secretary of the U.S. Treasury, Harry Dexter White. White, who became the first Executive Director for the US at the IMF, was also a CFR member, and later discovered to be part of the Soviet espionage ring in Washington. Robert McNamara, who became president of the World Bank, and ran the Vietnam War, stated:"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 196 There are only two possible ways in which a world of 10 billion people can be averted. Either the current birth rates must come down more quickly. Or the current death rates must go up. There is no other way. There are, of course, many ways in which the death rates can go up. In a thermonuclear age, war can accomplish it very quickly and decisively. Famine and disease are nature’s ancient checks on population growth, and neither one has disappeared from the scene.... To put it simply: Excessive population growth is the greatest single obstacle to the economic and social advancement of most of the societies in the developing world. 10 The World Wildlife Fund was created by Prince Philip, the husband of Elizabeth II Queen of England. Baptized with the name of Philip Battenberg, he belongs to the House of Oldenburg. He is the great-great-grandson of Grand Master of the Asiatic Brethren, Karl Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel, and also descended from George II, Catherine the Great of Russia, and Frederick I King of Prussia. Prince Philip is on record as saying that if he were to be reincarnated he would like to return as a killer virus, to help solve the overpopulation problem. Since then, other WWF executives have voiced the same concerns about overpopulation. Dr. Arne Schiotz, a WWF director has said, “Malthus has been vindicated, reality is finally catching up with Malthus. The Third World is overpopulated, it’s an economic mess, and there’s no way they could get out of it with this fast-growing population. Our philosophy is: back to the village.” 11 Sir Peter Scott, of the WWF, warned, “If we look at things causally, the bigger problem in the world is population. We must set a ceiling to human numbers. All development aid should be made dependent on the existence of strong family planning programs.” 12 Thomas Lovejoy, past vice-president of the WWF, said, “The biggest problems are the damn national sectors of these developing countries. These countries think that they have the right to develop their resources as they see fit. They want to become powers.” 13 The Oil Crisis The largest single expenditure of the postwar European Recovery Program, the Marshall Plan, named after its architect, Secretary of State George C. Marshall, by recipient countries in Western Europe, was to purchase oil, supplied primarily by American oil companies, and derived mainly from Saudi Arabia. The Seven Sisters reaped enormous profits for their oil sales to the new world market in that period. A consequence of the extraordinary expansion of the importance of the major American oil companies was the parallel rise of New York banking groups tied to these oil companies. During the early 1950s, a wave of bank mergers increasingly consolidated the already enormous political and financial"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"Petrodollars 197 influence of the New York banks over domestic US policy. According to William Engdahl, in A Century of War: Anglo-American Oil Politics and The New World Order: The net effect of this postwar cartelization of American banking and financial power into the tiny handful of banks in New York, strongly oriented to the fortunes of international petroleum markets and policy, had enormous consequences for the following three decades of American financial history, overshadowing all other policy influences in US and international policy, with the possible exception of the Vietnam War deficit-financing. 14 In 1955, Chase National Bank of David Rockefeller, grandson of John D. Rockefeller, merged with the Bank of Manhattan and the Bronx County Trust, to create the Chase Manhattan Bank. The National City Bank of New York, closely tied to the Standard Oil group, like Chase, acquired the First National Bank of New York to form the First National City Bank, later Citibank Corp. Bankers’ Trust took over the Public Bank & Trust, Title Guarantee & Trust and several other regional banks, to form another powerful group, while the Chemical Bank & Trust merged with the Corn Exchange Bank and the New York Trust Co. to form New York’s third-largest bank group, Chemical Bank New York Trust, also tied to Standard Oil. However, the culmination of the power of the oil industry would be achieved through their orchestration of the Oil Crisis. As pointed out by William Engdahl, in A Centruy of War: Anglo-American Oil Politics and the New World Order, it was by means of this fabricated crisis, that the Illuminati, through their manipulation of the Seven Sisters, deliberately impoverished the Third World, in compliance with their genocidal ambitions, funneling its wealth into their client state of Saudi Arabia. Already in May 1973, at a Bilderberg meeting at Saltsjoebaden, Sweden, a group of 84 of the world’s leading financial and political representatives discussed how to manage the coming flow of OPEC petroleum revenues, in advance of their plans to bring about the Oil Crisis. 15 Named for the Hotel Bilderberg near Arnheim, the super secret Bilderberg annual meetings had been initiated in 1954 by Prince Bernhard of Holland. Bernhard was married to Garter Knight, Queen Juliana of the Netherlands. A Freemason, Prince Bernhard had been a member of the SS. He later worked for I. G. Farben. But during the German invasion of the Netherlands, Bernhard helped organize the resistance. He offered to work for British intelligence but was not trusted. However, on the recommendation of George VI of the United Kingdom, he was later permitted to work in the war planning councils. 16 Prince Bernhard’s counterpart in America is David Rockefeller, Chairman of the board of the CFR whose economic base is the giant Chase Manhattan Bank and Standard Oil. 17 Among the other Bilderbergers were Baron Edmund de Rothschild, Robert McNamara of the World Bank, Sir Eric Roll of S.G. Warburg"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 198 and Co., Ltd and director of the Bank of England, Pierce Paul Schweitzer of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and George Ball of Lehman Bothers investment bank, past director of SOCAL, as well as member of the CFR. Present at the 1973 meeting were leading lights of the oil industry, and London and New York banking, including Sir Eric Roll, George Ball, David Rockefeller. Also included were Robert O. Anderson of Atlantic Richfiled Oil Co., former head of Arco, an oil company affiliated with Exxon; Lord Greenhill, chairman of British Petroleum; Zbigniew Brzezinski, soon Carter’s national security advisor; Gianni Agnelli of Italy’s Fiat, and Otto Wolff von Amerongen of Germany, director of Exxon and Trilateralist. Also present at the meeting was Henry Kissinger. According to Antelman, in To Eliminate the Opiate, German-born Kissinger is a Frankist. 456 Kissinger was appointed Assistant for National Security Affairs by Richard Nixon, and served as Secretary of State under both Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter. Kissinger is also reputed to belong to the CFR, the Royal Institute for International Affairs and the Trilateral Commission. William Engdahl asserts that the Yom Kippur War of 1973, when Egypt and Syria invaded Israel, was secretly coordinated by Washington and London, using the intricate diplomatic channels developed by Henry Kissinger. 19 Kissinger, already in firm control of all US intelligence estimates as Nixon’s National Security Adviser, secured control of US foreign policy as well, persuading Nixon to name him Secretary of State, just prior to the Yom Kippur war. Kissinger controlled the Israeli response through his relationship with Israel’s ambassador to Washington, Simcha Dinitz. In addition, Kissinger exploited channels to the Egyptians and Syrians. His method was to misrepresent to each party the critical elements of the other, ensuring the war and the subsequent Arab oil embargo. By October 16, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, raised the price of oil, and declared an embargo on the U.S. and the Netherlands, Rotterdam being the major oil port of Europe. As part of Kissinger’s plot to profit from the opportunity, the U.S. Treasury had established a secret accord with the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency, SAMA, according to which a substantial portion of the outflow of Saudi petrodollars resulting from the crisis, were to be invested in financing U.S. government deficits. And, Wall Street investment banker, David Mulford, was sent to advise SAMA investments into the banks of London and New York. As Engdahl summarizes, “... while Kissinger’s 1973 oil shock had a devastating impact on world industrial growth, it had an enormous benefit for certain established interests – the major New York and London banks, and the Seven Sisters oil multinationals of the United States and Britain.” 20"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"Petrodollars 199 Third World Poverty Following the Oil Crisis, the preconditions were in place for a dominant US policy, which, under Henry A. Kissinger, became decidedly “neo-Malthusian”. In 1974, in the midst of the Oil Crisis, Kissinger issued National Security Council Study Memorandum 200 (NSSM 200), on the subject of Implications both Worldwide Population Growth for US Security and Overseas Interests, directed to all secretaries, the military Joint Chiefs of Staff, the CIA and other key agencies. NSSM 200 argued that population expansion in select developing posed potential US “national security threats.” On October 16, 1975, at Kissinger’s insistence, President Gerald Ford issued a memorandum confirming the need for “US leadership in world population matters,” based on the contents of the classified NSSM 200 document. 21 The NSSM 200 warned that, under pressure from their expanding populations, countries possessing important and needed resources will tend to demand better terms of trade for their export to the United States. Therefore, the study identified a list of thirteen countries, singled out as “strategic targets” for US efforts at population control. In a memorandum, Kissinger had stated, “how much more efficient expenditures for population control might be than [funds for] raising production through direct investments in additional irrigation and power projects and factories.” 22 The thirteen countries were Brazil, Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Egypt, Nigeria, Mexico, Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand, Turkey, Ethiopia, and Colombia. Sadly, as Engdahl describes, “with this secret policy declaration, the government of the United States had committed itself to an agenda which would contribute to its own economic demise as well as untold famine, misery, and unnecessary death throughout the developing sector.” 23 Therefore, the countries made to suffer most heavily from the economic impact of the oil crisis were in the “Third World”. Because, the majority of the world’s less-developed economies, without significant domestic oil resources, were suddenly confronted with an unexpected and unpayable increase in costs of energy imports. The New York and London banks took the OPEC oil profits that had been deposited with them, and relent them as Eurodollar bonds or loans, to countries of those countries, now desperate to borrow dollars to finance their oil imports. Henry Kissinger termed this, “recycling petrodollars”, a strategy that had already been discussed at the 1971 Bilderberger meeting in Sweden. These conditions initiated a Third World debt crisis that is spiraling out of control. In 1974, Sudan, India, Pakistan, Philippines, Thailand, and numerous countries in Africa and Latin America, were faced with immense deficits in their balance of payments. As a whole, over 1974, developing countries incurred a total trade deficit of $35 billion according to the IMF, a colossal sum in that day, a deficit precisely four times as large as in 1973, and in proportion to the oil price increase. Following the several years of strong"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 200 industrial and trade growth of the early 1970s, the severe drop in industrial activity throughout the world economy in 1974-75 was greater than any other such decline since the war. The debt crisis began when Paul Volcker and the U.S. Federal Reserve had unilaterally increased U.S. interest rates in late 1979, ostensibly to try to save the failing dollar. After three years of record high U.S. interest rates, the dollar was “saved”, but much of the Third World was struggling economically, due to the large increase of their interest payments. By August 1982, the unjust recycling mechanism finally collapsed, and Mexico announced it would likely default on repaying Eurodollar loans. Finally, to enforce debt repayment, the London and New York banks brought the IMF in to act as “debt policeman”. Public spending for health, education, welfare was slashed on IMF “structural adjustment” recommendations, to ensure a country’s ability to repay loans. Living standards plummeted as IMF policies opened markets to the predatory process of globalization, led by US- based multinationals seeking cheap labor and raw materials. 24 Petrodollar recycling represented the siphoning off of the world’s wealth by oil producing countries, but primarily Saudi Arabia. Thus, despite all its posturing as a defender of orthodox Islam, not only was the Wahhabi regime of Saudi Arabia failing to represent the just principles of Islamic charity, and to point to the real causes of the poverty debilitating the Third World, but did the very opposite. Saudi Arabia has been a direct accomplice in one of the most evil crimes in history, the deliberate impoverishment of a great section of humanity, and abetted in the empowerment of the Illuminati banking elites."},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"201 Sex, Drugs and Rock ‘n Roll The combination of intoxicants and music to induce a state of altered consciousness has been the basis of occult rites since the very beginning. The use of these intoxicants was perfected by the Assassins, who used marijuana to create a mind-controlled assassins. Again, these same practices were revived by the Illuminati through their contacts with their Egyptian Brethren, who claimed descent from the Ismaili Grand Lodge. These same practices were the adopted by the Illuminati, in the twentieth century, to serve two ends. The first was, again, to create the mind-controlled agent-provocateurs, to perpetrate acts of terror in the name of Islam. The second aspect of this mission is to bring about the wholesale indoctrination of society as a whole. Important to ensuring the compliance of Western citizens, or at least ensuring they remain oblivious, to the diabolical schemes of the Illuminati, was a sophisticated large-scale indoctrination program, known collectively as the media and entertainment. Specifically, these devices were exploited to distance Western societies from their formerly- held Christian morals, which would otherwise motivate them to confront such a conspiracy. The means of accomplishing this denigration of society were, essentially, sex and drugs and rock ‘n roll. This strategy, implemented by agents of the Round Table, regarded as the bringing in the Age of Aquarius. The basis of the occult interpretation of history is that mankind history is determined by astrological ages. Every two thousand years or so, we enter into a new astrological age, as the sun rises under a new sign of the zodiac during the equinox. We are currently in the Age of Pisces, though we are considered to be about to enter the Age of Aqurius, which will mark the beginning of a New Age, when occult ideas will gain supremacy. These ideas began to gain popular appeal through the work of Alice Bailey, who had succeeded Annie Besant as head of the Theosophical movement. Together with her husband, Foster Bailey, Alice launched Lucifer Publishing Company, which published the theosophical periodical Lucifer . Though, they changed the name to Lucis Publishing Company.

Together, they work to implement what is termed “the Plan”, as was revealed in 24 books written by Bailey, and published by Lucis Trust. Alice Bailey claimed that it as Djwhal Khul, her “Ascended Master”, actually wrote the books through her while she was in a trance. Another “Master” Bailey claimed to have been in contact with was the enigmatic Comte St. Germain, whom she referred to as the “Master Rakoczi”, or the “Master R.” In Bailey’s The Externalisation of the Hierarchy, his title is said to be the “Lord of Civilization”. He is said to telepathically influence people who are seen by him as being instrumental in bringing about the new civilization of the Age of Aquarius. She said that “sometime after AD 2025”, Master Jesus, Master Rakoczi, Kuthumi, and the others in the Spiritual Hierarchy would “externalise”, i.e., descend from their spiritual planes, and live physically on Earth in ashrams surrounded by their disciples. The focus of “the Plan” she was instructed to pursue is to usher in the “Harmonic Convergence,” also known as the Omega, Mind Convergence, Fusion or Turning Point, which can occur only when nations put aside their differences in a “New World Order” of global unity. When world government and religion are finally realized, the New Age, or the Age of Aquarius, will have dawned. Only then will Jesus Christ the Avatar appear, and the implementation of the New World Order fully begin. This “Christ” is also known as Lord Maitraya, said to be awaited also by Jews, Moslems, Buddhists, and Hindus, though he is known by these believers respectively as the Messiah, Imam Mahdi, the fifth Buddha, or Krishna. Bailey makes it very clear that there is to also be a world religion: The spirit has gone out of the old faiths and the true spiritual light is transferring itself into a new form which will manifest on earth eventually as the new world religion. ...Judaism is old, obsolete and separative and has no true message for the spiritually-minded which cannot be better given by the new faiths...the Christian faith also has served its purpose; its Founder seeks to bring a new Gospel and a new message that will enlighten all men everywhere. 1 The Lucis Trust is run through an international board of trustees, whose membership is said to have included: John D. Rockefeller, Norman Cousins, Robert S. McNamara, Thomas Watson, Jr. of IBM, and former U.S. Ambassador to Moscow, Henry Clauson, a Grand Commander of the Supreme Council, 33rd Degree, Southern District Scottish Rite, and Henry Kissinger, thus tying Bailey’s organization into the various Round Table groups, including the CFR, the Bilderberger group, and the Trilateral Commission. 2 The plan would be brought about through the Tavistock Institute and its MK-Ultra mind-control program, a continuation of the MK-Ultra program. The basis of this program would be derived from the ancient mind-control techniques of the Assassins, acquired through their affiliation with the Salafi. 3 These same"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"The Age of Aquarius 203 basic methods would be adopted by the Tavistock Institute, but employed on a mass scale, using “sex and drugs, and rock ‘n roll”, to induce mental states in their audiences that would open them to specific forms of indoctrination. The Frankfurt School There are two approaches involved in mind-control. The first is manipulation of the individual, to fulfill specific tasks, and the second is indoctrination of entire societies, to induce their compliance with certain objectives. MK-Ultra grew out of the experimentation in psychiatry related to the field of eugenics, first developed by the Germans prior to WWII. Through the Tavistock Institute, three families, the Rockefellers, Warburgs, and Harrimans, together with British Crown agencies, jointly sponsored much of these social engineering projects, which called for the killing or sterilization of people whose heredity made them a public burden. 4 The Tavistock Institute’s projects were a follow-up on the work of the German scientists, known as Frankfurt Institute for Social Research, or the Frankfurt School, which focused on the study and criticism of culture developed from the thought of Freud. As an atheist, Freud believed that conventional morality is an unnatural repression of the sexual urges imposed during childhood. David Bakan, in Sigmund Freud and The Jewish Mystical Tradition, has shown that Freud was a “crypto-Shabbatean”. Freud, when he was made aware of the Lurianic Kabbalah exclaimed “This is gold!” and asked why these ideas had never previously been brought to his attention. 5 In his book Moses and Monotheism , Freud makes clear that, as in the case of the Pharaohs of Egypt, incest confers god-like status on its perpetrators. In the same book, Freud claims that Moses was an Egyptian, in an attempt to discredit the origin of the Law conferred by him. Commenting on these passages, Bakan claims that Freud was a follower of Shabbetai Zevi, and that his attack on Moses was an attempt to abolish the law in the same way that Zevi did. 6 The Frankfurt School converged on the thesis that mass media could be used to induce “regressive mental states, atomizing individuals and producing increased lability”, in other words, creating passivity by fostering alienation. Following the Tavistock Institute’s study of war psychosis, and its breakdown of individual personality, as Wolf describes, in Brainwashing: How The British Use The Media for Mass Psychological Warfare : From their work, an evil thesis emerged: Through the use of terror, man can be reduced to a childlike and submissive state, in which his powers of reason are clouded, and in which his emotional response to various situations and stimuli can become predictable, or in Tavistockian terms, “profitable.” By controlling the levels of anxiety, it is possible to induce a similar state in large"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 204 groups of people, whose behavior can then be controlled and manipulated by the oligarchical forces for whom Tavistock worked. 7 When the Frankfurt School researchers relocated to America, they were established at Columbia University in New York, where they also had links to the Radio Research Institute at Princeton University. While All Souls College at Oxford University was the base for Round Table operations in England, the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton University, established by Abraham Flexner, the prominent education theorist, of the Rockefeller and Carnegie Foundations, was the center of activities in America. 8 Lord Bertrand Russell, who joined with the Frankfurt School in this effort at mass social engineering, explained the basis of the strategy, in his 1951 book, The Impact of Science on Society: Physiology and psychology afford fields for scientific technique which still await development. Two great men, Pavlov and Freud, have laid the foundation. I do not accept the view that they are in any essential conflict, but what structure will be built on their foundations is still in doubt. I think the subject which will be of most importance politically is mass psychology.... Its importance has been enormously increased by the growth of modern methods of propaganda. Of these the most influential is what is called “education.” Religion plays a part, though a diminishing one; the press, the cinema, and the radio play an increasing part.... It may be hoped that in time anybody will be able to persuade anybody of anything if he can catch the patient young and is provided by the State with money and equipment. ...The subject will make great strides when it is taken up by scientists under a scientific dictatorship... The social psychologists of the future will have a number of classes of school children on whom they will try different methods of producing an unshakable conviction that snow is black. Various results will soon be arrived at. First, that the influence of home is obstructive. Second, that not much can be done unless indoctrination begins before the age of ten. Third, that verses set to music and repeatedly intoned are very effective. Fourth, that the opinion that snow is white must be held to show a morbid taste for eccentricity. But I anticipate. It is for future scientists to make these maxims precise and discover exactly how much it costs per head to make children believe that snow is black, and how much less it would cost to make them believe it is dark gray. ...Although this science will be diligently studied, it will be rigidly confined to the governing class. The populace will not be allowed to know how its convictions were generated. When the technique has been perfected, every government that has been in charge of education for a generation will be able to control its subjects securely without the need of armies or policemen. 9 While music can have many beneficial aspects, it had long been long been used in the occult mystery rites to enflame the passions and rile the worshipper into a trance state of demon possession. These qualities were recognized by"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"The Age of Aquarius 205 the Illuminati researchers of the Frankfurt School as powerful for indoctrination purposes. Essentially, music can be used to reduce the listener to a state of emotional immaturity, which renders him susceptible to the message it contains. Aldous Huxley, the principal agent of this conspiracy, published a book called The Devils of Loudun in 1952, where he described this phenomenon: If exposed long enough to the tomtoms and the singing, every one of our philosophers would end by capering and howling with savages. Assemble a mob of men and women, treat them to amplified band music, bright lights, and in next to no time you can reduce them to a state of almost mindless subhumanity. Never before have so few been in a position to make fools, maniacs, or criminals of so many. 10 The social theory of rock was elaborated by musicologist Theodor Adorno, who headed the Radio Research Project: In an imaginary but psychologically emotion-laden domain, the listener who remembers a hit song will turn into the song’s ideal subject, into the person for whom the song ideally speaks. At the same time, as one of many who identify with that fictitious subject, that musical I, he will feel his isolation ease as he himself feels integrated into the community of “fans.” In whistling such a song he bows to a ritual of socialization, although beyond this unarticulated subjective stirring of the moment his isolation continues unchanged... The comparison with addiction is inescapable. Addicted conduct generally has a social component: it is one possible reaction to the atomization which, as sociologists have noticed, parallels the compression of the social network. Addiction to music on the part of a number of entertainment listeners would be a similar phenomenon. 11 In 1939, the Radio Project published some of their findings in the Journal of Applied Psychology. Their conclusion was that Americans had, over the previous twenty years, become “radio-minded,” and that their listening had become so fragmented that repetition of format was the key to popularity. The play list determined the “hits”, and repetition could make any form of music, or any performer, a “star.” As long as a familiar form or context was retained, almost any content would become acceptable. “Not only are hit songs, stars, and soap operas cyclically recurrent and rigidly invariable types,” said Adorno a few years later, “but the specific content of the entertainment itself is derived from them and only appears to change. The details are interchangeable.” 12 Researchers of the Radio Research Project concluded that radio had already so conditioned the minds of its listeners, having already rendered them fragmented and unthinking, that repetition of format was the key to popularity. 13 In a report prepared for the University of Michigan’s Institute for Social Research, Paul Hirsch described the product of Adorno’s Radio Research Project. According to Hirsch, the establishment of postwar radio’s Hit Parade “transformed the mass"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 206 medium into an agency of sub-cultural programming. Radio networks were converted into round-the-clock recycling machines that repeated the top forty hits.” Hirsch documented how all popular culture, including movies, music, books, and fashion, is now run on the same program of preselection. 14 The CIA and Operation Mockingbird The director of the Radio Research Project was Paul Lazersfeld, with a Ph.D. in industrial psychology, who married Herta Herzog, the first director of research for the CIA’s Voice of America, and eventually became Chairman of the Board of the RAND Corporation, and also head of Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS). The founder and chief executive officer of CBS was career intelligence operative William Paley, also a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. 15 At the behest of his friend Allen Dulles, Paley hired CIA agents to work undercover at CBS, as part of operation Mockingbird. Mockingbird was created in 1948 as part of Office of Policy Coordination (OPC), by its director Frank Wisner, as an effort to recruit American news organizations and journalists to become spies and disseminators of propaganda. Wisner was told by the CIA to create an organization that would concentrate on: Propaganda, economic warfare; preventive direct action, including sabotage, anti-sabotage, demolition and evacuation measures; subversion against hostile states, including assistance to underground resistance groups, and support of indigenous anti-Communist elements in threatened countries of the free world. 16 CIA Director Dulles had staffed the CIA almost exclusively with Ivy League graduates, especially from Yale with figures like George Herbert Walker Bush from Yale’s Skull and Bones Society. 17 Prescott Bush was introduced to Paley by Averell Harriman, who in 1929 had represented CBS in a merger with Paramount Studios. In 1932, Bush took an active role in arranging the financing for Paley to purchase the company, and joined the board of directors, a position which he retained for several years. Thus, through Rockefeller money, Henry Luce, a member of Skull and Bones, was financed to set up a number of national magazines, among them Life, Time, Fortune, and later House and Home and Sports Illustrated. The Rockefellers also directly or indirectly financed the Coles Brothers’ Look magazine, and a chain of newspapers. They financed Sam Newhouse, who controlled Random House and the Newhouse magazines, which included The New Yorker, Parade, and a Conde Nast list of nine U.S. magazines, among them Glamour and Vogue. Eugene Meyer, one of the founders of CFR, and first president of the World Bank, bought the Washington Post, Newsweek, the"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"The Age of Aquarius 207 Weekly magazine, and other publications. Lehmans, Goldman-Sachs, Kuhn- Loebs, and the Warburgs, controlled of the film industry, Hollywood, radio, and television. 18 The CIA had infiltrated the nation’s businesses, media, and universities with tens of thousands of on-call operatives to act as spies and stimulate the anti- communist hysteria of the Cold War. Ultimately, the CIA’s media assets would eventually include ABC, NBC, CBS, Time, Newsweek, Associated Press, United Press International (UPI), Reuters, Hearst Newspapers, Scripps-Howard, Copley News Service, etc. and 400 journalists, who have secretly carried out assignments according to documents on file at CIA headquarters, from intelligence-gathering, to serving as go-betweens. 19 These journalists sometimes wrote articles that were commissioned by Wisner himself, and the CIA also provided them with classified information to help them with their work. 20 Paley said that television created the capability to “out-Goebbels, Goebbels.” 21 To Adorno and his “fellow travelers”, “Television is a medium of undreamed of psychological control.” 484 Adorno declared, “Television aims at the synthesis of radio and film, and is held up only because the interested parties have not yet reached agreement, but its consequences will be quite enormous and promise to intensify the impoverishment of aesthetic matter so drastically...” 23 Adorno states that all television programming contains, first, an overt message, referring to the plot, characters, scene, etc. It is in this overt content that successful formula are employed to guarantee viewership. But within this overt content, according to Adorno, there lies a “hidden message” that is less obvious, and which represents a particular moral theme for purposes of indoctrination. MK-Ultra Essentially, MK-Ultra involves the use of trauma-based programming techniques to deliberately induce a state of Multiple Personality Disorder (MPD), also known as Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID). Of the various subprojects under the umbrella of MK-Ultra was Project Monarch, officially begun by the U.S. Army in the early 1960’s. Project Monarch was the catchword for mind-control projects involving US military, CIA, NASA and other government agencies. Methods used by Project Monarch included drugs, hypnosis, torture and electroshock. John W. DeCamp, in The Franklin Cover- up, quotes Anton Chaitkin explaining that it is, “the production of a horde of children in whom the soul is crushed, who would spy, whore, kill and commit suicide.” 24 Recovering Monarch victims confirm of ongoing trauma being conducted through “ritual abuse”, or “satanic ritual abuse”, typically involved in Satanism or Luciferianism. Basically, MPD involves hypnosis, which is recognized as a branch of magic, or a phenomenon once known as demon possession. Mind-control"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 208 programming seeks to create “alters” in the victim: alternative personalities. These can be used for specific tasks, including illegal activities, like delivering drugs, or other black-market activities, or assassinations. These alter personalities are segregated and compartmentalized within the victim’s mind by the repeated use of stun guns, drugs and hypnosis. This creates denial mechanisms that isolate specific memories in certain areas of the mind. An alter can be accessed by anyone who knows the “codes” or “triggers”. These triggers, which induce a trance state, or possession, can including telephone tones, nursery rhymes, and dialogue from certain movies or hand signals. The most notorious aspect of Tavistock’s mind-control program were the outrages committed by Ewen Cameron. Cameron had been hired by Tavistock to evaluate the sanity of Nazi official Rudolph Hess, and was later to testify as an expert at the Nuremberg war crimes trials. 25 In 1943, the Rockefeller Foundation created the Allen Memorial Institute at McGill University in Montreal. Donald Ewen Cameron was placed in charge of the institute’s psychiatry. Experiments in coercive interrogation and brainwashing would be conducted by Cameron under the auspices of the Canadian military, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the CIA. Dr. Cameron’s “terminal” use of electric shock as a brain-burning torture, psychosurgery, and brainwashing with drugs and hypnosis would make the Canadian program the most famous aspect of the CIA’s MK- Ultra experiments. Dr. Allen Cameron had founded the Canadian branch of the World Federation for Mental Health, headed by his friend, Tavistock Institute chief, Brig. Gen. John R. Rees. In 1948, Dr. John Rawlings Rees, was picked by Montagu Norman, to act as president of the World Federation for Mental Health, and run the world’s psychological services. 26 World Federation for Mental Health was created on the recommendation of the United Nations’ World Health Organization (WHO) and Unesco. Unesco’s partnership with Rees was guided by its founding secretary general, eugenics strategist Sir Julian Huxley, and by Unesco social sciences chief Dr. Otto Klineberg, a Tavistock- affiliated psychologist specializing in the supposedly racial characteristics of the “American Negro”. 27 The World Federation and Tavistock functioned to supply LSD to the United States as part of the Aquarian Conspiracy, through their agents, Aldous Huxley and Allen Dulles. Lysergic acid diethylamide, or LSD, was developed in 1943 by Albert Hoffman, a chemist at Sandoz A.B. a Swiss pharmaceutical house owned by S.G. Warburg, of the Warburg family, who also operated I.G. Farben. Allen Dulles, the director of the CIA when that agency began MK- Ultra, was the OSS station chief in Berne, Switzerland, throughout the early Sandoz research. One of his OSS assistants was James Warburg, who worked with both Aldous Huxley and Robert Maynard Hutchins, president of the University of Chicago. 28 Huxley’s A Brave New World is set in London in the twenty-sixth century,"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"The Age of Aquarius 209 The entire planet is united as The World State, a peaceful world government established in the aftermath of an apocalyptic global war in the 21st century. Warfare and poverty have been eliminated, and everyone is permanently happy, by keeping them immersed in promiscuous sex, and consumption of a drug called Soma. The name Soma is telling of Huxley’s occult tendencies, as it is the same as the narcotic drug once used for occult purposes by the ancient Chaldean Magi. In a lecture to the California Medical School, in San Francisco, in 1961, Huxley explained: There will be, in the next generation or so, a pharmacological method of making people love their servitude, and producing dictatorship without tears, so to speak, producing a kind of painless concentration camp for entire societies, so that people will in fact have their liberties taken away from them, but will rather enjoy it, because they will be distracted from any desire to rebel by propaganda or brainwashing, or brainwashing enhanced by pharmacological methods. And this seems to be the final revolution. 29 In 1960, Huxley was appointed visiting professor at MIT in Boston. He created a circle at Harvard parallel to his West Coast LSD team. The Harvard group included Huxley, Osmund, and Watts, Timothy Leary, and Richard Alpert. From the discussions of the Harvard seminar, Leary put together the book The Psychedelic Experience, based on the ancient Tibetan Book of the Dead. Watts at the same time founded the Pacifica Foundation, which sponsored the WKBW in San Francisco and WBM-FM in New York City radio stations, which were among the first to push the Rolling Stones, the Beatles, and the Animals, and would later pioneer “acid rock” and eventually “punk rock.” As admitted by Jefferson Airplane’s leading musician, Paul Kantner: The new rock music is intended to broaden the generation gap, alienate parents from their children, and prepare young people for revolution. 30 Dr. Gregory Bateson, anthropologist with the OSS, and the former husband of anthropologist Margaret Mead, became the director of a hallucinogenic drug experimental clinic at the Palo Alto Veterans Administration Hospital. Through drug experimentation on patients, already hospitalized for psychological problems, Bateson established a core of “initiates” into the nest of Isis Cults, which Huxley had founded in southern California and in San Francisco. Foremost among his Palo Alto recruits was Ken Kesey. By 1967, through Kesey’s efforts in disseminating the drug, they created the “Summer of Love”, in the Haight-Ashbury district of San Francisco. 31 The catalyst to expand this mystical “free-love” philosophy was the “anti-war”movement. Lord Bertrand Russell had begun laying the foundations for the anti-war movement, or Ban the Bomb, in the 1950s, as a means toward"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 210 one-world government. The banks in New York provided financing to establish the Institute for Policy Studies (IPS), the U.S. branch of the Russell’s Peace Foundation, among whose founding trustees was James Warburg. The founding director of IPS was Marcus Raskin, a fellow of the National Training Labs, a U.S. subsidiary of the Tavistock Institute. After its creation by the League for Industrial Democracy, Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), the umbrella of the student anti-war movement, was financed and run through IPS. 32 The infrastructure for providing the drugs that swamped the anti-war movement and the college campuses of the United States in the late 1960s was organized crime. The role of the Mafia in the Aquarian conspiracy was coordinated by John Maynar Hutchins. At only age twenty-eight, Hutchins was appointed dean of Yale Law School, where became one of the primary advocates for the Institute of Human Relations, Yale’s propaganda organ for the New World Order, founded by members of the ultra-secret Skull and Bones society. Two years later, he was appointed president of the University of Chicago, where he was one of the leading proponents of “general education”, pushing the study of “Western civilization”. With the help of his longtime associate Mortimer J. Adler, he introduced the Great Books program at the university. Hutchins established the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions (CSDI) in Santa Barbara, California, which was principally financed through organized crime. Hutchins also recruited Aldous Huxley, Elisabeth Mann Borghese, the daughter of Thomas Mann, and a number of Rhodes Scholars, who had originally been brought into the University of Chicago during the 1930s and 1940s. The two main sources of funds for the CSDI were the Fund of Funds, a tax-exempt front for Bernie Cornfeld’s IOS, and the Parvin Foundation, a parallel front for Parvin-Dohnnan Co. of Nevada. IOS and Parvin-Dohnnan held controlling interests in the Desert Inn, the Aladdin, and the Dune, all Las Vegas casinos that were associated with Meyer Lansky’s Mafia crime syndicate. Effectively, IOS acted as a conduit for LSD, hashish, and marijuana distribution throughout the 1960s. 33"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"211 The Aspen Institute and the Club of Rome Part of the indoctrination process sought for through the Aquarian conspiracy was not only to degrade morals and immerse the public in numerous diversions, but also to inculcate the basic principles of the New Age cult, towards establishing a one-world-religion. The means of achieving this objective has been the Environmental movement. This movement was spearheaded by the Aspen Institute, who, together with the United Nations, the Club of Rome, the Tavistock, and other such organizations originating from the Round Table, began propagandizing around the issue of nuclear energy. 1 The reason being that proliferation of nuclear energy as an alternative posed a threat to the oil interests that were dominated by the Rockefellers and the Saudis. However, they claimed deceptively that it was the environment that was being destroyed, and therefore instead rallied against “industrialization” and for “limits to growth”. The American oilman, Robert O. Anderson, was a central figure in this agenda. Anderson and his Atlantic Richfield Oil Co. funneled millions of dollars, through their Atlantic Richfield Foundation, into select organizations to confront nuclear energy. Robert O. Anderson’s major vehicle to spread his propaganda strategy among American and European establishment circles, was his Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies. The Aspen Institute was founded in 1949, by Aldous Huxley, and John Maynard Hutchins, in commemoration of the 200th birthday of German philosopher and author of Faust, and a member of the Illuminati, Goethe. Robert O. Anderson also contributed significant funds to a project initiated by the Rockefeller family, together with Aurelio Peccei and Alexander King, at the Rockefeller’s estate at Bellagio, Italy, called the Club of Rome. In 1972, this Club of Rome, and the US Association of the Club of Rome, gave widespread publicity to their publication of the notorious “Limits to Growth.”. Supported by research done at MIT, this report concluded that industrialization had to be halted to save the planet from ecological catastrophe. These organizations were exploiting the panic induced when Paul Ehrlich, a biologist at Stanford, and admirer of Bertrand Russell, in 1968, 22 : One-World-Religion"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 212 wrote his Malthusian projections in a best-selling book called The Population Bomb. In it, Ehrlich suggested, “a cancer is an uncontrolled multiplication of cells; the population explosion is an uncontrolled multiplication of people.... We must shift our efforts from the treatment of the symptoms to the cutting out of the cancer. The operation will demand many apparently brutal and heartless decisions.” 2 Ehrlich also advocated placing birth control chemicals into the world’s food supplies. The chief individual in this agenda is director of the Aspen Institute, Canadian multi-millionaire Maurice Strong. Strong is being heralded as the “indispensable man” at the center of the U.N.’s global power. He has served as director of the World Future Society, trustee of the Rockefeller Foundation and Aspen Institute, and is a member of the Club of Rome. Strong is now Senior Advisor to UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, Senior Advisor to World Bank President James Wolfensohn, Chairman of the Earth Council, Chairman of the World Resources Institute, Co-Chairman of the Council of the World Economic Forum, and member of Toyota’s International Advisory Board. However, Strong also now heads the Golden Dawn, operates an international drug ring, and is a top operative for British Intelligence. 3 He was a founding member of both the Planetary Citizens. Strong and other luminaries, like Queen Juliana of the Netherlands, Sir Edmund Hillary, Peter Ustinov, Linus Pauling, Kurt Vonnegut, Leonard Bernstein, John Updike, Isaac Asimov, Pete Seeger, are listed as original endorsers of Planetary Citizens. Founded by Donald Keys, a disciple of Alice Bailey and former UN consultant, and presided over for many years by the late Norman Cousins (CFR), the Planetary Citizens organization supports the expansion of UN power and institutions. In Earth At Omega, Keys maintains: We have meditations at the United Nations a couple of times a week. The meditation leader is Sri Chinmoy, and this is what he said about this situation: “The United Nations is the chosen instrument of God; to be a chosen instrument means to be a divine messenger carrying the banner of God’s inner vision and outer manifestation. One day the world will ... treasure and cherish the soul of the United Nations as its very own with enormous pride, for this soul is all-loving, all-nourishing, and all-fulfilling”. 4 Maurice Strong also sits on the board of directors, and serves as director of finance, for the Lindisfarne Center. Lindisfarne was founded by New Age philosopher William Irwin Thompson, a former professor of humanities from MIT and Syracuse University. Thompson said: We have now a new spirituality, what has been called the New Age movement. The planetization of the esoteric has been going on for some time... This is now beginning to influence concepts of politics and community in ecology... This is the Gaia [Mother Earth] politique... planetary culture.” Thompson"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"One-World-Religion 213 further stated that, the age of “the independent sovereign state, with the sovereign individual in his private property, [is] over, just as the Christian fundamentalist days are about to be over. 5 The Lindisfarne Center is located in Manhattan’s historic Episcopal Cathedral of St. John the Divine, dedicated to St. John, traditionally revered by Freemasons of the Johannite creed. Maurice Strong is the Finance Director. The center is supported by the Lilly Endowment, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, and the Rockefeller Foundation, and lists among its faculty members Amory Lovins, Gaia theory biologist James Lovelock, and Luciferian adept and New Age author David Spangler. According to Spangler, in Reflections on the Christ: Lucifer, like Christ, stands at the door of man’s consciousness and knocks. If man says, “Go away because I do not like what you represent, I am afraid of you,” Lucifer will play tricks on that fellow. If man says, “Come in, and I will give to you the treat of my love and understanding and I will uplift you in the light and presence of the Christ, my outflow,” then Lucifer becomes something else again. He becomes the being who carries that great treat, the ultimate treat, the light of wisdom.... 6 Located at the same Cathedral of St. John the Divine that houses the Lindisfarne Luciferians is the Temple of Understanding. It was founded by Lucis Trust, and is the controlling authority for World Goodwill of Alice Bailey. Launched in the early 1960s as the “spiritual counterpart of the United Nations,” its founding sponsors included: John D. Rockefeller IV; then-Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara, Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger, IBM president Thomas J. Watson, Socialist Party leader Norman Thomas, Eleanor Roosevelt, Time-Life president James A. Linen, author Christopher Isherwood, columnist Max Lerner; and entertainer Jack Benny. The Temple organization, which works closely with the UN Secretariat, the World Council of Churches, and the World Conference on Religion and Peace, promotes the “Interfaith Movement” with its centennial celebration of the World’s Parliament of Religions. Maurice Strong is also a member of the Bahai World Faith. With Haifa, in Israel, as the site of its international headquarters, the Bahai movement now exercises a strong presence in the United Nations and its One-World Religion agenda. Its involvement in the UN dates back to its founding in 1945. In 1948, the Bahai community was recognized as an international non-governmental organization. In May 1970, they were granted consultative status with the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), and later with the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF). The Bahai organization has a working relationship with the World Health Organization (WHO), is associated with the UN Environment Programme, as well as many other religious, environmental and social programs."},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 214 In 1978, Strong bought the Colorado Land & Cattle Company, which owned 200,000 acres of San Luis Valley in Colorado, from Saudi arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi. 7 A mystic had informed Maurice and his wife Hanne, that the ranch, which they call “the Baca”, “would become the center for a new planetary order which would evolve from the economic collapse and environmental catastrophes that would sweep the globe in the years to come.” The Strongs say they regard the Baca, which they also refer to as “The Valley Of the Refuge Of World Truths”, as the paradigm for the entire planet. The first groups to join the Strongs in setting up operations at the desert site were the Aspen Institute and the Lindisfarne Association. The Baca is replete with monasteries, and Ashram, Vedic temple, Native American shamans, Hindu temple, ziggurat, and subterranean Zen Buddhist center. Shirley MacLaine’s astrologer told her to move to the Baca, and she did. She is building a New Age study center there where people can take short week- long courses on the occult. Another of Strong’s friends, Najeeb Halaby, a CFR member, former chairman of Pan American, and father of the Queen of Jordan, wife to Freemason King Hussein, has built an Islamic ziggurat at the Baca. Apparently, the Kissingers, the Rockefellers, the McNamaras, the Rothschilds also make their pilgrimage to the Baca. 8 Few areas in the US are as rife in paranormal activity as Baca. The modern history of unexplained occurrences began in the 1950s when green fireballs were reportedly seen by thousands, and even before that were rashes of “UFOs” that sound like what the Natives called “spirit lights.” So frequent are such reports in the valley that a UFO “watchtower” was erected. “From the fall of 1966 through the spring of 1970 there were hundreds of unidentified flying object sightings and many of the first documented cases of unusual animal deaths ever reported,” notes Christopher Obrien, in The Mysterious Valley, a website dedicated to a study of the strange occurrences and sightings in the region. “During peak “UFO” sighting waves in the late 1960s dozens of cars would literally “line the roads” watching the amazing aerial displays of unknown lights as they cavorted around the sky above the Great Sand Dunes/Dry Lakes area.” 9 An interview, titled The Wizard Of the Baca Grande, which Maurice Strong conducted with West magazine of Alberta, Canada, in May 1990, he provides details which elucidate the reasons behind the Illuminati’s support of the environmental movement. Strong concluded with a disturbing apocalyptic scenario he would to include in a novel he says he would like to write: Each year the World Economic Forum convenes in Davos, Switzerland. Over a thousand CEOs, prime ministers, finance ministers, and leading academics gather in February to attend meetings and set the economic agendas for the year ahead.

Isn’t it our responsibility to bring that about? This group of world leaders form a secret society to bring about a world collapse. It’s February. They’re all at Davos. These aren’t terrorists – they’re world leaders. They have positioned themselves in the world’s commodity and stock markets. They’ve engineered, using their access to stock exchanges, and computers, and gold supplies, a panic. Then they prevent the markets from closing. They jam the gears. They have mercenaries who hold the rest of the world leaders at Davos as hostage. The markets can’t close. The rich countries...?” and Strong makes a slight motion with his fingers as if he were flicking a cigarette butt out of the window. 10 The Earth Summit One of the more important achievements of the Aspen Institute was a conference on Technology: Social Goals and Cultural Options, held in 1970, that paved the way for the UN’s Earth Summit in Stockholm in 1972, chaired by Aspen board member, Maurice Strong. As remarked Engdahl, the Stockholm conference created the necessary international organizational and publicity infrastructure, so that by the time of the Kissinger orchestrated oil crisis, an intensive anti- nuclear propaganda offensive could be launched, aided through the millions of dollars made available from oil-linked channels of the Atlantic Richfield Company, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund and other such elites. Among the groups that were funded were organizations including the World Wildlife Fund, then chaired by Prince Bernard, and later by Royal Dutch Shell’s John Loudon. As Engdahl noted: It is indicative of this financial establishment’s overwhelming influence in the American and British media that, during this period, no public outcry was launched to investigate the probable conflict of interest involved in Robert O. Anderson’s well-financed anti-nuclear offensive, and the fact that his Atlantic Richfield Oil Co. was one of the major beneficiaries from the 1974 price increase for oil. Anderson’s ARCO had invested tens of millions of dollars in high-risk oil infrastructure in Alaska’s Prudhoe Bay and Britain’s North Sea, together with Exxon, British Petroleum, Shell and the other Seven Sisters. 11 Strong was Secretary-General of the UN Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), held at the June 1992 UN Earth Summit in Brazil. It was hoped that an Earth Charter would be the result of the Earth"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 216 Summit, but it was not the case. Nevertheless, an international agreement was adopted, named Agenda 21, which laid down the international “sustainable development” necessary to form a future Earth Charter agreement. Maurice Strong hinted at the overtly pagan agenda proposed for a future Earth Charter, when in his opening address to the Rio Conference delegates he said, “It is the responsibility of each human being today to choose between the force of darkness and the force of light.” And, he said, “We must therefore transform our attitudes and adopt a renewed respect for the superior laws of divine nature”. According to Strong, “The real goal of the Earth Charter is that it will in fact become like the Ten Commandments.” 12 The summit was described by Time magazine as a “New Age carnival.” On the eve of the UNCED, a midnight-to-dawn homage to the “Female Planet” was held on Leme Beach. After dancing all night, the worshipers followed a Brazilian high priestess to the water’s edge, where they offered flowers and fruits to the Voodoo mother goddess, “Iemanje, mae orixa, mother of the powers, queen of the seas,” known in Western mythology as Aphrodite or Venus, and then invoked the blessings of the sea goddess upon the summit’s deliberations. At the culmination of the program, a group calling itself the “Sacred Drums of the Earth”, performed a ceremony by which they would “maintain a continuous heartbeat near the official site of the Earth Summit, as part of a ritual for the healing of our Earth to be felt by those who are deciding Earth’s fate.” 13 Thus, the environmental movement, while helping to advance the cause of the oil industry, is an extension of the Aquarian conspiracy, incepted by Alice Bailey, designed ultimately to foster the acceptance a one-world- religion, based on the occult, or the New Age, as it is called. The Union for Natural Environment Protection, an environmental group based in Sao Leopoldo, Brazil, declared the following about the work of the summit: A world-wide citizens’ movement is born around the UN system and will be in the years ahead a central focal point for the New World Order which Alice Bailey wrote about many decades ago and which is going to be politically free, socially fair, economically efficient and environmentally sustainable. 509 The environmental movement is being used as a cover to promote return to the creed of the Ancient Mysteries, in the form of the worship of mother-nature, a pagan notion that equates the goddess with earth, known among the ancient Greeks as Gaia. Originally, she is the Babylonian Ishtar, known to the Bible as Astarte, or the Egyptian Isis. This pantheistic idea has its origins in ancient paganism, and is central to the Kabbalah and all Western occult tradition, including Freemasons and the Illuminati. Plato wrote: “We shall affirm that the cosmos, more than anything else, resembles most closely that living Creature of which all other living creatures, severally or genetically, are portion; a living creature which is fairest of all and in ways most perfect.” 510 Known as Anima Mundi, the “Soul of the World”, it"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"One-World-Religion 217 is related to the concept of the Neoplatonists, the Logos, or the Word, also known as the “Son of God”, or the ancient dying-god."},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 218"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"219 Islamic Fundamentalism The “Limits to Growth” ideology of the environmental movement would also be used by the Illuminati, towards the end of the Cold War, to set the stage for the phase of its agenda, a third world war targeted against the Muslim World. This final showdown would be incepted by bin Laden, with his attack on the World Trade Center. However, the conditions necessary for this final even had been in the making for twenty-five years. The basis of this condition was the proliferation of Islamic terrorism, and the expansion of the network of terrorists to be eventually employed. This plot began with the installation of the Ayatollah Khomeini in Iran. The means of achieving this would be through the Aspen Institute’s and Club of Rome’s “limits to growth” strategy. As Robert Dreyfuss described, the impoverishment of the Third World was a deliberate policy of British colonialism, in which it employed corrupt regimes like that of Saudi Arabia, and radical terrorist cults like the Muslim Brotherhood. He writes: For Americans, British sponsorship of the Muslim Brotherhood should not be surprising. The policy of the British Empire was to maintain London’s colonies in a state of underdevelopment. In the Middle East, the British have always sought out the corrupt tribal leaders and the venal clergy to lead movements whose objectives have always seemed to coincide with the British objectives. With the Muslim Brotherhood, British Imperial policy was institutionalized in the form of a disciplined organization dedicated to returning the Middle East to the Dark Ages. 1 The explosion of violence throughout the Middle East, in the late seventies and early eighties, was not something that occurred by chance, but was the result of a deliberate plan developed by the Illuminati strategists, such as Dr. Alexander King, Henry Kissinger, Zbigniew Brzezinski, and British operative Bernard Lewis. It was Bernard Lewis, Professor Emeritus of Near Eastern Studies at Princeton, and a former British agent, who first 23 : The Arc of Crisis"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 220 coined the phrase “Clash of Civilizations”, in a September 1990 Atlantic Monthly article, on “The Roots of Muslim Rage,” which appeared three years before Huntington’s diatribe. In 1979, Bernard Lewis, attended the super-secret Bilderberg meeting in Austria, and contributed to the discussion of “Muslim Fundamentalism”. The Bernard Lewis Plan, is the code-name for a top-secret British strategy for the Middle East. Lewis’ Plan endorsed the Muslim Brotherhood movement behind Khomeini, in order to promote for the Balkanization and fragmentation of the entire Muslim Near East along ethnic and religious lines. 2 Lewis argued that the West should encourage nationalistic upheavals among minorities, such as the Lebanese Maronites, the Kurds, the Armenians, Druze, Baluchis, Azerbaijani Turks, Syrian Alawites, the Copts of Ethiopia, Sudanese mystical sects, Arabian tribes and so on. The result would be, in Brzezinski’s terminology, an Arc of Crisis. Brzezinski, who served as National Security Advisor during the Carter administration, believed that global dominance was dependent of control of the numerous states of Soviet Central Asia. Brzezinski had, in turn, been seduced by Bernard Lewis, into believing that Islamic fundamentalism could be played as a “geo-strategic” card to destabilize the USSR. This strategy would be achieved by employing all the covert means made available through Illuminati channels, and with the CIA again exploiting the services of the Muslim Brotherhood, to foment revolution and deface the image of Islam. Despite all their posturing as defenders of orthodoxy, the Muslim Brotherhood are using the pretext of seeking to implement the global “caliphate”, or Muslim ruler, to seek the destruction of Middle Eastern societies, to conspire with the Illuminati towards the implementation of a New World Order, based on occult principles. As described by Robert Dreyfuss: The real story of the Muslim Brotherhood is more fantastic than the mere imagination of the authors of espionage novels could create. It functions as a conspiracy; its members exchange coded greetings and secret passwords; although no formal membership list exists, its members are organized into hierarchical cells or “lodges” like the European freemason societies and orders. The Muslim Brotherhood does not respect national frontiers; it spans the entire Islamic world. Some of its members are government officials, diplomats, and military men; others are street gangsters and fanatics. While the leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood are at home in plush-carpeted paneled board rooms of top financial institutions, at the lower levels the Muslim Brotherhood is a paramilitary army of thugs and assassins. At its highest level, the Muslim Brotherhood is not Muslim. Nor is it Christian, Jewish, or part of any religion. In the innermost council are men who change their religion as easily as other men might change their shirts. Taken together, the generic Muslim Brotherhood does not belong to Islam, but to the pre-Islamic barbarian cults of mother-goddess worship that prevailed in ancient Arabia. As much as the peddlers of mythology might want"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"The Arc of Crisis 221 us to believe that the Muslim Brotherhood and Ayatollah Khomeini represent a legitimate expression of a deeply rooted “sociological phenomenon”, it is not the case. Nor does the Muslim Brotherhood represent more than a tiny fraction of the world’s Muslim believers. 3 In 1955, the Muslim Brotherhood relocated its headquarters from Cairo to London and Geneva, making more obvious its relationship with the powers installed there. In Geneva, its leader, Said Ramadhan, who was married to the daughter of Hasan al Banna, set up the Institute for Islamic Studies. In Cairo, Ramadhan had been indicted on charges of conspiring to murder Nasser, and was accused of maintaining ties with Israeli intelligence. 4 In 1973, Ramadhan founded the Islamic Council of Europe, with headquarters in London, together with Salem Azzam, of the important Azzam family. By allying itself with a faction of the Muslim Brotherhood, the Club of Rome and the Aspen Institute, in furtherance of the Illuminati’s objectives in Iran, used the same pretext of environmental and spiritual concerns, to orchestrate the overthrow of the Shah in that country. Based on the same philosophy of “limits to growth”, the reason provided for his overthrew was the proposed expansion of his country’s nuclear industry. As explained by Peter Goodgame, in The Globalists and the Islamists, “with the rise in energy prices the development of the Third World was checked, but the Arab Middle East became greatly enriched. This was when the Globalists turned to their allies, the Islamists, to remedy the situation. Islam would be used to attack industrialization and modernization using the lie that human progress was un- Islamic and a Western plot against the servants of Allah.” 5 The Existentialists As the Aspen Institute began agitating against the Shah, the Club of Rome shifted the focus of the Muslim Brotherhood in Western Europe around a new, synthetic, zero-growth version of Islam. 6 The Shah of Iran had originally been installed by a CIA sponsored coup, orchestrated by Kim Roosevelt, and H. Norman Schwartzkopf, father of the Gulf War General of same name. The reason was to overthrow Mossadegh, who had been popularly elected president in 1953. However, the Western powers later became opposed to the Shah’s attempts at developing the country’s nuclear power industry. First, the Shah signed petroleum agreements with ENI, the Italian oil company. In the behind-the-scenes discussions, at a symposium held by the Aspen Institute in Persepolis, Iran, in 1975, as described Robert Dreyfuss, “plans for reversing the Shah’s industrialization program and for turning Iran into a model dark ages regime were mapped out.” 7 Attending the Persepolis symposium were at least a dozen members of the Club of Rome, including its"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 222 chairman, Aurellio Peccei, Sol Linowitz of Coudert Brothers law firm, Jacques Freymond of the Institute of International Studies in Geneva, and Robert 0. Anderson and Rarlan Cleveland, both Aspen Institute officials and associates of the Club of Rome in the United States. The Aspen Institute session stressed a single theme: modernization and industry undermine the “spiritual, nonmaterial” values of ancient Iranian society, and that these values must he preserved above all else. 8 From 1975 onward, the Aspen Institute developed closer ties to the Iranian ministry of education, through agents like Manuchehr Ganji, who introduced the Institute to Iran. Mary Catherine Bateson, daughter of Aquarian conspirator Gregory Bateson, taught at Damavand College in Teheran, where she was a critical participant in this strategy, sowing the seeds of “antimaterialist” rebellion among the youth of Iran. Instructions were passed to Professor Ali Shariati to intensify his political activity. “More than anyone else”, says Robert Dreyfuss, “Shariati was the guiding light behind the Iranian students and intellectuals who brought about the Muslim Brotherhood revolution.” 9 Ali Shariati, a Freemason, and many of the leading educators in Iran’s universities, were brought into the circle of opposition to the Shah. Shariati’s father was Aqa Muhammad Taqi Shariati, who, though he had also been a Freemason, started the Center for the Propagation of Islamic Truth in Mashad, Iran. Traveling often between Paris and Teheran, Ali Shariati built up a cult following among the youth of Iran. Shariati introduced Iranian students to the works of Jean-Paul Sartre, Frantz Fanon, Albert Camus, Jacques Berque, and Louis Massignon, all writers of anticapitalist existentialist camp, and all funded and guided by the same Club of Rome networks that gathered at Persepolis. 10 It was not Islam, but these philosophers, all followers of Nietzsche, who provided the ideological framework of terrorism. These philosophers themselves held various associations that prove them to be not mere thinkers, but actual propagandists promoted by the Illluminati. They presented arguments for anti-colonialist struggle, based on Bakunin’s anarchistic philosophy of violence as a purgative force. A key figure in this tradition was the German philosopher Martin Heidegger. Heidegger was indirectly influenced by Jacob Boehme, and ultimately Lurianic Kabbalah, through his interest in Friedrich Schelling, Freemason and friend of Hegel. Heidegger argued that, in order to escape the yoke of Western capitalism and the “idle chatter” of constitutional democracy, the “people” would have to return to their primordial destiny through an act of violent revolutionary “resolve.” 11 This vision of the postmodernist revolution went from Heidegger into the French postwar Left, especially the works of Jean-Paul Sartre, eager apologist for Stalinism and the Cultural Revolution in China. Several of Sartre’s writings dwell on the theme that “dirty hands” are necessary in politics, and that a man with so-called bourgeois inhibitions about bloodshed"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"The Arc of Crisis 223 cannot usefully serve a revolutionary cause, and in some of his later writings suggested that violence might even be a good thing in itself. 12 In The Wretched of the Earth, Sartre’s protégé, the Martiniquan writer Frantz Fanon argued that violence was necessary for Third World peoples, not just as a way to gain their liberty, but also because it would cure them of the inferiority complex created in them by the White man and his colonial rule. 523 Fanon wrote the Wretched of the Earth after having travelled to Algeria in 1953, to join the National Liberation Front, or FLN guerillas, in their fight against French colonial rule. As reported by Pierre Beaudry, Frantz Fanon and Otto Skorzeny were the theoretician and the commando training officer of the FLN, both advocating terrorism as a means of achieving national liberation. 14 Algerian War for Independence In 1958, the Arab Commercial Bank in Geneva, set up by Genoud, with the help of Otto Skorzeny, had helped to provide arms and money to both sides of the war of Independence in Algeria. Several Third Reich veterans, including Maj. Gen. Otto Ernst Remer, who served as Hitler’s bodyguard, helped smuggle weapons to the Algerian rebels seeking independence, while other Nazi advisors provided military instruction. 15 Skorzeny became engaged in an ultra-right faction within the French Army, the French Secret Army Organization (OAS), in support of a conspiracy to block President Charles de Gaulle’s plans to grant independence to Algeria. The OAS was controlled from the outside by financier Pierre Guillain de Benouville, in cooperation with Allen Dulles of the CIA, Hitler’s Economics Minister, Hjalmar Schacht and Genoud. 16 Francois Genoud had been in contact with Allen Dulles since 1943, and also through their joint support of the French Secret Army Organization (OAS) in Algeria. 17 When Allen Dulles was OSS Station Chief in Berne, Switzerland, he helped Genoud transfer Hitler and Goebel trusts into Swiss bank accounts. 18 Though more could be learned about Genoud’s contacts with the Americans, the State Department has yet to declassify sixteen documents relating to his case, while twenty-nine other documents relating to his application for a visa or permit to enter the U.S. remain classified. 19 The OAS fomented the war of independence in Algeria, of 1954 to 1962, by simultaneously aiding the fascist and colonial supporters of French Algeria, and the guerrilla fighters, represented by the Algerian National Liberation Front (FLN). Instrumental in the conspiracy was François Mitterrand, a holdover of the fascist, Freemasonic organization called the Cagoule. It was through the initiative of Mitterand, that head of the OAS, Jacques Soustelle, was nominated governor-general of Algeria. 20 The OAS teamed up with Skorzeny, who trained leading components"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 224 of both the OAS and the FLN. Skorzeny was, at that time, also reportedly providing assistance to the right-wing fascist Jabotinsky networks of the Israeli Mossad, through the services of James Jesus Angleton’s CIA operations in Spain. In November 1954, the FLN guerrillas launched a series of attacks against the French military, and issued a proclamation calling on all Muslims of Algeria to join the fight for “the restoration of the Algerian State, sovereign, democratic, and social, within the framework of the principle of Islam.” 21 The response was given, not by the Minister of Defense, but by Minister of the Interior, Francois Mitterrand, who replied: “The only possible negotiation is war.” 22 Pierre Beaudry describes the atrocities that ensued: In August 1955, the FLN was deployed to conduct the massacre of Philippeville, murdering 123 people, including women and children. Algeria’s Governor- General Soustelle ordered massive retaliation attacks, which, according to some estimates, killed 1,273 guerrilla fighters (the FLN reported 12,000 deaths). The truth is probably half-way, about 6,000 victims. The cycle of vengeance was on. Thousands of Muslims were tortured and killed in an orgy of bloodletting organized by the French Armed Forces and police. The idea was to unleash an unstoppable process of escalation of violence and retaliation. 23 The Revolution in Iran In 1977, by the Club of Rome, with the Muslim Brotherhood, created an organization to pursue to the retardation of Iran’s industry, called Islam and the West. Headquartered in Geneva, Islam and the West came under the guidance of Muslim Brotherhood leader, and former Syrian prime minister, Marouf Dawalibi, in addition to two non-Muslim luminaries, Aurelio Peccei, and another original endorser of Planetary Citizens, Lord Caradon, Britain’s Jerusalem expert and former British ambassador to the U.S. 24 One of the sponsors of Islam and the West was the prestigious International Federation of Institutions of Advanced Studies. Among its funders were Aurelio Peccei, Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands, and Robert O. Anderson. Islam and the West held its first planning sessions at Cambridge University in England. Backed by the International Federation of Institutes of Advanced Study, headed by Alexander King, Islam and the West assembled a policy outline in 1979, on science and technology for the subversion of Islam. Alexander King was also a Club of Rome member, and a founder of NATO. According to researcher Dr. John Coleman, when it was decided that a super- body would control European affairs, the RIIA founded the Tavistock Institute, which in turn created NATO. 25 Islam and the West declared: “We have to return to a more spiritual conception of life... The first lesson of Islamic science is its insistence on the notion of a balanced equilibrium which would not"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"The Arc of Crisis 225 destroy the ecological order of the environment, on which collective survival finally depends.” 26 This argument was used to attack “Western” science and technological progress in Europe and North America. Through the behind-the-scenes efforts of the Club of Rome, when the Shah introduced his plan for modernization, the Ayatollah Khomeini had emerged as the leader of the religious opposition. Up until his exile from Iran in 1964, Khomeini was based at the religious city of Qom, where, according to Radio Free Iran, as reported by Dr. Coleman, a former British Intelligence agent, he received a “monthly stipend from the British, and he is in constant contact with his masters, the British.” 27 Khomeini was kicked out of Iran and settled in Iraq. He lived there for a number of years until he was arrested by the Iraqi government and deported in 1978. French President D’Estang was then pressured to offer Khomeini refuge in France. Khomeini’s stay in France was financed by Francois Genoud. 538 As Coleman writes, “Once Khomeini was installed at the Chateau Neauphle, he began to receive a constant stream of visitors, many of them from the BBC, the CIA and British intelligence.” 29 The BBC then became the Ayatollah’s main promoter. Dr. Coleman writes: It was the BBC, which prepared and distributed to the mullahs in Iran all of the cassette tapes of Khomeini’s speeches, which inflamed the peasants. Then, the BBC began to beam accounts of torture by the Shah’s SAVAK to all corners of the world. In September and October 1978, the BBC began to beam Khomeini’s revolutionary ravings directly to Iran in Farsi. The Washington Post said, “the BBC is Iran’s public enemy number one.” 30 Soon a large segment of the Iranian population, most of them young students, became opposed to the Shah, and were convinced that a return to “pure” Shiah Islam, under the Ayatollah Khomeini’s leadership, was the only way to save their country. The Carter Administration, manipulated by Zbigniew Brzezinski, then collaborated with the British to topple the Shah and install Khomeini. In 1980, in accordance with the Nihilist philosophy he was serving, Khomeini proclaimed to the people of Iran, “destroy, destroy, destroy. There cannot be enough destruction.” 31 In his memoirs, looking back on the events that removed him from power, the Shah lamented, “I did not know it then, perhaps I did not want to know - but it is clear to me now, the Americans wanted me out.” 32"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 226"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"227 Iran-Contra Operation Before embarking on its plan for World War III, the Illuminati would first have to end the Cold War, by subduing the Soviet Union, to render America the remaining Western superpower to be pitted against the Muslim World. Therefore, in a Time magazine cover story, published on Jan. 15, 1979, Brzezinski proclaimed Iran, Afghanistan, and the Indian subcontinent as an “arc of crisis” that posed a grave challenge to the West, though one that could also spell doom for the Soviet empire. Essentially, in the Illuminati agenda, the Arc of Crisis was used as a pretext to ignite a band of Islamic fundamentalism across Central Asia, that could be first be used to bankrupt and destroy the Soviet Union, and then to recruit and engage a wave of Islamic fundamentalists to later be used as the specter of terrorism with which to frighten the Western world. This strategy was revealed in the 1998 interview which Brzezinski gave to the Le Nouvel Observateur: Yes. According to the official version of history, CIA aid to the Mujahadeen began during 1980, that is to say, after the Soviet army invaded Afghanistan, 24 Dec 1979. But the reality, secretly guarded until now, is completely otherwise. Indeed, it was July 3, 1979 that President Carter signed the first directive for secret aid to the opponents of the pro-Soviet regime in Kabul. And that very day, I wrote a note to the president in which I explained to him that in my opinion this aid was going to induce a Soviet military intervention... We didn’t push the Russians to intervene, but we knowingly increased the probability that they would. 1 Chief among these Mujahideen dissidents was CIA asset Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, who for their sake postured a radical view of Islam and anti-Americanism. Hekmatyar received a diploma in engineering from Kabul University in 1968. At this time, he showed no sign of religious fundamentalism, though in 1970, he joined the Muslim Youth, a faction of the Muslim Brotherhood. Nevertheless, he was also a member of the quasi- 24 : Guns, Drugs and Jihad"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 228 Marxist PDPA, until he was accused in 1972 of murdering a Maoist student. He was found guilty and sent to jail for a period of two years. During the Daoud coup of 1973, Hekmatyar escaped to Pakistan, and was recruited by Pakistani intelligence. In Pakistan, Hekmatyar then founded the Hezbi Islami, or Party of Islam, even though he had never received a classical Islamic education. On December 24th of that same year, after being invited by the Afghani government, the Russian military took up positions to protect government assets from rebel attacks. The CIA’s backing of the Mujahideen war in Afghanistan would become its largest covert operation in history, funded by an intricate series of clandestine and illegal activities, known as the Iran-Contra Affair, which involved the complicity of the Muslim Brotherhood and the Saudi regime. Essentially, the tremendous wealth created in Saudi Arabia through the orchestration of the Oil Crisis, would act as a slush fund to finance the CIA’s covert operations. When Reagan became president, his administration engaged in an expansion of the relationship already set out with Roosevelt, by which Saudi Arabia would build a massive network of naval and air defense facilities that could sustain U.S. forces, under the pretext that they would be needed to protect the region or wage war against an aggressor. The program also involved a new understanding that Saudi Arabia would become a partner in covert operations, but not just in the Middle East. The Saudis agreed to fund anti-communist guerrillas in Afghanistan, Angola, and elsewhere, who were supported by the Reagan administration, including the Contras of Nicaragua. 2 Aside from Iran-Contra, when war broke out between Iran and Iraq in 1980, the U.S. secretly backed both sides of the conflict, and also became involved in an operation known as Iraq-gate. The Reagan administration used proceeds from arms sale to Iran to fund the right-wing Contras, in an effort to overturn Nicaragua’s left-wing, but democratically elected, Sandanista government. Both actions were contrary to acts of Congress, which prohibited the funding of the Contras, and the sale of weapons to Iran, which it regarded as a “terrorist state”. In addition, both activities also violated United Nations’ sanctions. Throughout this period, until the death of Khomeini in 1989, Iran was the command center of international terrorism, inciting all Muslims, both Sunni and Shiah, to fight the Western countries, which he categorized as “greater and lesser Satans”. At the behest of the Americans, and using the local Shiah communities as intermediaries, Iran had supported and financed a number of “liberation” movements and armed factions, from Palestine to Northern Ireland, to Sudan, and the Ivory Coast. 3 Initially, in order to side-step Congress, the U.S. approached Prince Bandar to solicit Saudi aid in funding the Contras. Prince Bandar bin Sultan, who was the grandson of Ibn Saud, and Hassa bint Ahmed al-Sudairi, one of the most honored and respected women in Saudi Arabia, was appointed Saudi ambassador to the U.S. in 1983, at the age of 34, an appointment he served for twenty years. Prince Bandar has had unprecedented access to Presidents and"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"Guns, Drugs and Jihad 229 most senior American officials since the Reagan era. He was a close family friend of the Bushes, named affectionately by Barbara as “Bandar Bush”. After the Hezbollah bombed American facilities in Beirut, and kidnapped CIA station chief William Buckley, it was Casey and Bandar who agreed to assassinate Sheikh Fadlallah, the terrorist group’s leader. Control of the operation was handed to the Saudis, who turned to the services of an operative from Britain’s elite special forces. The plan backfired, however, when the car bomb took down an apartment building near Beirut, killing eighty innocent civilians. Fadlallah escaped unharmed. Nevertheless, to cover their tracks, the Saudis provided Fadlallah with information identifying the operatives they had hired. 4 Over time, Saudi aid to the Contras amounted to $32 million. Bandar was also used as an intermediary with Saddam, when he made known his readiness to accept American aid. The U.S. had also been aiding the Iranians, primarily to gain their influence with militant groups that held several American hostages in Lebanon, and who supported bombings in Western European countries. However, the U.S. was also concerned with supporting Saddam, to protect the Saudis and its oil reserves. Though Congress would not have approved, the Reagan administration secretly allowed Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Egypt to transfer U.S. weapons, including howitzers, helicopters, and bombs, to Saddam. Also, part of the proceeds of the weapons sales to Iran had been channelled to finance the Mujahideen in Afghanistan: The Washington Post reported that profits from the Iran arms sales were deposited in one CIA-managed account into which the U.S. and Saudi Arabia had placed $250 million apiece. That money was disbursed not only to the contras in Central America but to the rebels fighting Soviet troops in Afghanistan. 5 The complexities of the Iran-Contra operation, and the arming of the fundamentalist Islamic Mujahideen in Afghanistan, were orchestrated by William Casey, then director of the CIA. Known as “off-the-shelf”, meaning unaccountable and invisible, Casey’s operations involved arms being traded with the Contras for cocaine, and profits from its sale to Black street gangs of Los Angeles, funds from which were then used for the various covert CIA campaigns. The U.S. government’s involvement in drug-trafficking for the financing of covert activities dates back at least to the Office of Strategic Service (OSS), the predecessor of the CIA. A private agreement was settled between Allen Dulles, then Swiss “Station Chief” for the OSS, and later Director of the CIA, and SS General Karl Wolff, against the direct, written orders of President Roosevelt. The SS were granted freedom from prosecution in return for agreeing to secretly work for American intelligence against the Russians in the cold war. However, since it was impossible for the OSS to fund this secret network, Dulles allowed the Nazis to finance themselves from their vast stocks of Morphine, plundered Jewish gold, and a mass of counterfeit British bank-notes. 6"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 230 During the Vietnam War, the CIA, with the assistance of the Hmong hill tribes of Vietnam, were smuggling huge amounts of Heroin from the Golden Triangle region of Southeast Asia. Prior to that, the French had controlled the Opium trade in this part of the world, a ring later became known as the “French Connection”. With the embarrassing defeat of the French at Dien Bien Phu, in 1954, the French began to withdraw their forces from Indochina, the Americans prevailed over the French, and appropriated the Opium trade, facilitated through the CIA’s Air America network of aircraft. Years after the Vietnam War was over, the CIA remained an important player in the Golden Triangle heroin trade. This fact was corroborated by Colonel Bo Gritz, a legend in the Special Forces community, after whom Sylvester Stallone modeled himself in the movie “First Blood”. During 1989, Gritz and two others traveled to the Shanland region of northern Burma, controlled by warlord Khun Sa, who runs the Golden Triangle Opium business. Gritz videotaped a meeting with Khun Sa, in which he revealed that the US government official he dealt with was Richard Armitage, the US Assistant Secretary of Defence. Khun Sa said that Armitage, in turn, used the services of a “traffic manager,” who he named on camera as Santos Trafficante, Florida’s notorious Mafia “Boss”. 7 Armitage had been a professional assassin in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia during the Vietnam war, and lead teams similar to the Phoenix program that killed and tortured tens of thousands of Asians. He has been accused of links to illicit gambling, drug smuggling and expansion of organized crime in Russia, Central Asia and the Far East. 8 As Assistant Secretary of Defense in the Reagan Administration, Richard Armitage was in charge of coordinating covert military operations, and was in close liaison with Oliver North. Armitage’s deputy and chief anti-terrorist official, Noel Koch, was part of the team set up by Oliver North, in addition to Richard Secord, George Cave, a former CIA station chief in Tehran, and Colin Powell, military assistant to U.S. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger. It was William Casey, with the collaboration of Richard Armitage in the Pentagon, who ran the Mujahideen covert war. Stinger missiles, mountain caves equipped as operation centers, military training camps for internationally recruited Islamic combatants, as well as training and recruitment inside the United States, were part of what was funded, using profits from the sale of opium and illicit drugs, funneled through the notorious Bank of Credit and Commerce International, or BCCI, at the behest of the Saudi Arabian government, working closely with the American CIA that used a proxy to cover its involvement, ISI, the Pakistani secret service."},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"Guns, Drugs and Jihad 231 BCCI From the beginning of the Afghan War, the CIA, partnered with Pakistani Intelligence, in organizing the rebel Mujahideen fighters.

The power of the ISI increased for its first twenty years, until the emergence of Pakistan’s first popularly elected leader, the socialist Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in 1971. Bhutto fell out of favor with the British, and was overthrown by General Zia Ul-Haq, who had been appointed Chief of the Army Staff by Bhutto in 1976, at the insistence of Gulam Jilani Khan, the Director General of the ISI. In his book, If I Am Assassinated, penned in prison, Bhutto relates how Henry Kissinger threatened him for pushing forward on Pakistan’s nuclear energy program, telling him, “We will make an example of you!” 9 Bhutto was executed in 1978. A spokesman of the Muslim Brotherhood boasted, “The Brotherhood has taken over in Iran and Pakistan. Bhutto stood for intrusion of the West into Islam. Bhutto was everything that Pakistan was not. That is why we killed him. And we will use his death as a warning to others.” 10 The primary conduit for CIA funds to the Mujahideen fighting in Afghanistan would be the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, BCCI. BCCI, the first Third World multinational bank, which was created in 1972 by Pakistani banker Agha Hasan Abedi, was initially funded by Sheik Zayed of Abu Dhabi, in anticipation of the petrodollar bonanza of the oil crisis. In The Outlaw Bank, Beatty and Gwynne describe that, “BCCI had been built from oil, from the enormous wealth that flowed into the Middle East after the huge OPEC oil price increases of the 1970s.” 11 Of the coincidence, they further note, “though Abedi could not claim full credit for it, the timing of BCCI’s launch was nothing short of miraculous” 12 , particularly since the American speaker at the 1973 Bilderberg meeting stated that, once oil prices would have increased, “serious problems would be caused by unprecedented foreign exchange accumulations of countries such as Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi.” 13 One of BCCI’s early moves to gain legitimacy was its purchase in 1976 of 85% of the Banque de Commerce et Placements of Geneva, Switzerland. After taking over the bank, BCCI installed Alfred Hartmann as manager. Hartmann then became the chief financial officer for BCC Holding, and thus one of BCCI’s most influential directors. Hartmann maintained connections with the Rothschilds, being president of Rothschild Bank AG of Zurich. Hartmann was also vice-chairman of NY-InterMaritime Bank of Geneva, run by Mossad operative Bruce Rappaport, who was on the board of N.M. Rothschild and Sons in London. Though BCCI was created by a Pakistani, it was ultimately a British- based and British-controlled bank. BCCI was initially incorporated in Luxembourg, famous for its lax banking restrictions, and soon branches and"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 232 holding companies sprouted up around the globe: in the Cayman Islands, the Netherlands Antilles, Hong Kong, Abu Dhabi, Washington DC and just about everywhere else. However, by 1980, when the BCCI finally applied for and received a license from the Bank of England, there were already more branches in the UK than in any other nation. In fact, one of BCCI’s primary economics advisors was the former British Prime Minister Lord James Callaghan. 14 “Black funds” for the CIA traveled through BCCI for the Contra war, the Iranian-Israeli payoffs, and large covert wars in Afghanistan and Angola. Casey had wanted to establish an offshore entity capable of conducting covert operations that was “stand-alone”, financially independent, and free from congressional oversight. BCCI was the solution. In the early eighties, Casey began meeting regularly with Abedi in Washington D.C. 15 While he had until then been reticent, some secret deal seems to have been struck with Casey, because Abedi then moved aggressively to establish BCCI in the U.S. 16 CIA assistant director Robert Gates once referred to BCCI jokingly as the “Bank of Crooks and Criminals.” 17 BCCI became the favored bank for Middle Eastern terrorists, and arms and drug runners, South American drug cartels, organized crime lords, and intelligence services such as the ISI, Mossad, MI6 and the CIA. A branch was set up in Panama, for the cash that Manuel Noriega was funneling out of his country. Noriega, who had been a long-standing U.S. intelligence asset, was also an informant for the Mossad. He had undergone military and intelligence training in Israel, and-like Uganda’s dictator Idi Amin, wore his Israeli paratrooper wings on his uniform for years afterward. On one of his visits to Israel, in the 1980s, Noriega bought a seaside villa in the Tel Aviv suburb of Herzliya. Back in Panama, he sent his children to the Jewish community’s prestigious Alberto Einstein day school, and even to an Israeli kibbutz one summer. 18 Noriega’s mentor was Michael Harari, a Mossad intelligence agent. When Harari finished directing Mossad death squads against the PLO in the early 1970s, he was transferred to Central and South America. Harari supervised what became known as the Harari Network, set up in 1982 by the Reagan administration and the Israeli government, to run a secret aid program for the Nicaraguan contras. Operating out of Mexico, Panama, and Florida, the network integrated his operations with the emerging cocaine trade, particularly those of Colombia’s Medellin and Cali cocaine cartels, and shipped guns to the Contras and smuggled cocaine from Colombia to the US via Panama. 19 It was the CIA that had set up the meetings in which various Colombian drug dealers organized into a drug trafficking Medellin cartel in 1981, permitting it to deal with a group rather than many independent drug dealers. 20 In his book, Defrauding America: Encyclopedia of Secret Operations by the CIA, DEA and Other Covert Agencies, Rodney Stich reports a conversation recorded by one of his informants, Gene “Chip” Tatum, a helicopter pilot for the US Army and the CIA, where Harari explained:"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"Guns, Drugs and Jihad 233 What we do has nothing to do with preserving a country’s integrity. It’s just business and third world countries see their destiny as defeating borders and expanding. The more of this mentality we can produce, the greater our wealth. We train and we arm: that’s our job. And in return we get a product far more valuable than the money for a gun. We’re paid with product and we credit top dollar for product [i.e., drugs]. Look, one gun and 3,000 rounds of ammo is $1,200. A kilo of product [cocaine] is about $1,000. We credit the Contras $1,500 for every kilo. That’s top dollar for a kilo of cocaine. It’s equivalent to the American K-Mart special: buy four, get one free. On our side we spend $1,200 for a kilo and sell it for $12,000 to $15,000. Now that’s a profit center. And the market is much greater for the product than for weapons. It’s just good business sense. Understand? 21 The more conventional departments of BCCI handled such services as laundering money for the drug trade and helping dictators loot their national treasuries. BCCI also operated a clandestine division of the bank called the “black network”, which functioned as a global intelligence operation and a Mafia-like enforcement squad. The black network used sophisticated spy equipment and techniques, along with bribery, extortion, kidnapping, prostitution, and even, by some accounts, assassination. The black network operated a lucrative arms-trade business and transported drugs and gold. According to an international arms dealer, who frequently worked with the black network: B.C.C.I. was a full-service bank. They not only financed arms deals that one government or another wanted to keep secret, they shipped the goods in their own ships, insured them with their own agency and provided manpower and security. They worked with intelligence agencies from all the Western countries and did a lot of business with East bloc countries. 22 It is evident the BCCI’s black network is an appendage of an original Illuminati body. To understand how so-called “Islamic terrorists” are deceptively recruited, it is revealing to consider an account reported by Beatty and Gwynne through their source, a Palestinian named Sami Masri, who had defected from the Pakistani branch of the operation: They recruited me in 1984 when I was going to college in Pittsburgh... They called me on the phone, they knew me from home, they knew a lot about me, and it was easy to relate to them. When they showed up, they were just normal people, very humble, down to earth... They were young white people, Persians, Armenians out of Jordan, Pakistanis living in the Emirates. They all spoke Arabic, most of them with a Palestinian accent. It was all very friendly at the beginning. They gave me money, there were"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 234 parties and women, and then they began to explain the power and connections they had and suggested that I join their organization. They told me I would learn later what the orgnization was really about. They were always there for you and they just sort of took control of everything. They taught me about leadership, gave me books to read – books on how to deal with people, on psychology. They talked about not showing your emotions. They were always saying “That’s what a leader does, and you should behave like a leader. In 1985 I got my first operation: there were six people, and I was in charge; I had instructions, support, cash. We went out of Karachi to Bangladesh and then to India. We had documents, passports, and we flew to England. People were waiting for us there. They picked up the stuff and gave us new passports and travel documents. I got paid $50,000 and the others got $10,000 each. I found out later that this first operation was an easy one; it was meant to go like clockwork to give us confidence. We got into the really heavy things later.... All of a sudden they started talking to us differently; it was almost like boot camp. It wasn’t friendly anymore. We trained with arms, and there was other special training: breaking and entering, setting up bugs, and eavesdrop devices.... We were acting as couriers, delivering documents and gathering military and industrial information... government secrets. I was sent to interrogate people – people that were targeted. We would learn everything about them; we would do that ourselves or hire detective agencies. At times when there were people we wanted to recruit, or people who had information that we wanted, we would put hundreds of thousands of dollars in their bank accounts before we talked to them... It is a very good technique if you can afford it, and we had unlimited money. If you look at your bank account and see that you have a million dollars that you didn’t think you had... it is much harder to return that money then it is to turn it down in the first place. And in some circumstances, you are already compromised just because the money is in your account and you can’t explain it.... [Those targeted were...] People we wanted to work with us. Generals, politicians, government officials, bank officers, it was in all countries... We trained together [with the Mossad] in Karachi for covert operations. We gathered information for the Mossad, spying on the Gulf States because we were so close to the ruling families there that we were familiar with the foreign policies. The Israelis sold U.S. arms, technology, expertise to Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka, and BCCI brokered the deals... [BCCI] gave the Mossad, Israel, the use of their agents in the Emirates. BCCI was friends with everybody... We did joint operations; BCCI was financing Israeli arms going into Afghanistan. There were Israeli arms, Israeli planes, and CIA pilots. 23 Sheikh Zayed and Sheikh Kamal Adham, director of Saudi intelligence between 1963 and 79, brother-in-law of King Faisal, and the CIA’s key liaison in the Arab world during the 1980’s, secretly acted as BCCI nominees in a hostile take-over of Washington D.C.’s largest bank, Financial General Bankshares, that soon became First American Bankshares. From BCCI’s initial attempts to acquire First American, in 1978, until his forced resignation in 1991, former Secretary of"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"Guns, Drugs and Jihad 235 Defense Clark Clifford, from his position as the top official at the bank, was one of the central figures in BCCI’s acquisitions and management of American banks. Clark Clifford, who had been Washington’s preeminent attorney, was referred to by the Financial Times as “the ultimate insider”. According to Gwynne and Beatty, Clifford “was without doubt one of the most remarkable personalities ever to navigate the treacherous currents of national politics.” 24 Clifford became special counsel to the president in 1946, and assisted in the formulation of the Truman Doctrine, which stated that the United States would support “free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures.” Clifford was instrumental in persuading Truman to recognize the nation of Israel. Clifford was also co-author of the National Security Act of 1947, which set up both the CIA and NSC, and was important in the creation of the Department of Defense. In 1950, Clifford left politics and became the first Washington lawyer to earn a million-dollar income. He was John F. Kennedy’s attorney while he was still a senator, and continued to offer his advice during his campaign and presidency. Clifford returned to government in 1968 as Lyndon B. Johnson’ secretary of defense, where he advised the president to end the war in Vietnam. His advice was also sought by Pres. Carter, who consulted Clifford regarding difficulties involving his budget director, Burt Lance. It was precisely his reputation and connections that led the Arab front men for BCCI to seek Clifford’s help in acquiring an American bank. The Federal Reserve Board approved the takeover in 1981, reassured by Clifford that there would be no control by BCCI, which he also represented. Ten years later, Robert Morgenthau, the district attorney in New York City, found evidence that the parent company of Clifford’s bank was in fact secretly controlled by BCCI. The D.A. convened a grand jury to determine whether Clifford and his partner, Altman, had deliberately misled federal regulators. Clifford’s predicament worsened when it was disclosed that he had made about six million dollars in profits from bank stock that he bought with an unsecured loan from BCCI. A New York grand jury handed up indictments, as did the Justice Department. Clifford’s assets in New York, where he kept most of his investments, were frozen. Clifford said the investigation caused him pain and anger. If the regulators had been deceived about any secret ownership by BCCI, he said, he too had been deceived. Mena, Arkansas BCCI’s First American was set up in the U.S. with the assistance of Jackson Stephens, of Little Rock, Arkansas, the former operational headquarters of Albert Pike. The Stephens Group, a multibillion-dollar empire of companies, which is operated by Jackson Stephens and his family, dominates the Arkansas economy,"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 236 where they own a large part of more than a dozen banks, the most exclusive hotel in Little Rock, and the building that houses Bill Clinton’s Arkansas office. Stephens is named in the court records as having brought Saudi billionaire Ghaith Pharaon, of BCCI, together with Stephens’ close friend Bert Lance, who had been a cabinet official under President Jimmy Carter. However, Stephens, and Lance, like Clark Clifford, all maintain they did not know the group of investors headed by Pharaon, were actually fronting for BCCI. Clinton’s staff has also refused to comment on the series of connections. 25 Stephens played a part in the CIA-supervised cocaine smuggling operation based in Mena, Arkansas, during Bill Clinton’s term as governor in the 80s. Mena was a key CIA trans-shipment point for the Iran-Contra operation. 26 One estimate suggests that Barry Seal, who also worked for the CIA and the Drug Enforcement Administration, ran as much as a hundred million worth of cocaine a month through Mena. 27 It was Barry Seal’s plane crashing in Nicaragua that exposed the Iran-Contra affair. Nevertheless, CBS News correspondent Bill Plante complained there is a trail of “tens of millions of dollars in cocaine profits [from Mena], and we don’t know where it leads. It is a trail that has been blocked by the National Security Council.” 28 Barry Seal had been recruited at the age of seventeen, along with Lee Harvey Oswald, by CIA agent David Ferrie, at a two week summer camp of the Louisiana Civil Air Patrol in 1957. 29 David Ferrie, a career U.S. intelligence agent, was a participant in the assassination of President Kennedy, and the first focal point of Jim Garrison’s investigation of Kennedy’s murder. The assassination team went by the name of Operation 40, established by Allen Dulles, which had played a major role in the Bay of Pigs invasion. The group was presided over by then-Vice President Richard M. Nixon, and recruited former Batista-regime intelligence officers, mob henchmen, mercenaries like Frank Sturgis and CIA case officer Howard Hunt, who would later become one of the Watergate burglars. As revealed by John Hankey, in his film JFK II, at a 1975 Senate re-investigation into the case, William Colby, as head of CIA, testified that George Bush Sr. and Hunt headed the Kennedy assassination, but said that “...they weren’t really in charge. They were just taking orders from civilians like Allen Dulles and the Rockefellers.” Colby was then promptly dismissed, and George Bush Sr. was appointed to head the CIA in his place. One important business in the Arkansas narcotics network was Park- on-Meter, or POM Inc. Commercially, POM was to produce parking meters and machine parts. Covertly, it was manufacturing untraceable custom weapons parts for the Contras, and shipping them to Mena. POM had subcontracted the job from a CIA front, called Iver Johnson’s Firearms, of Jacksonville, Arkansas. Former CIA scientist, Michael Riconosciuto, is one of the original architects of the backdoor to PROMIS, a people-tracking software system sold to intelligence organizations and government drug agencies worldwide, originally part of a U.S. plot to spy on other spy agencies. Riconosciuto has"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"Guns, Drugs and Jihad 237 told reporters that he was closely involved in these covert operations, and claims that he supervised high-tech equipment transfers to POM, and had developed software to help launder the Mena drug money. 30 Park-On-Meter was the first company to receive a loan from the Arkansas Development Finance Authority (ADFA), created by the Arkansas state legislature at Clinton’s urging in 1985. Its ostensible purpose was to attract capital to the state, for the purpose of economic development, by offering companies long- term loans financed through the sale of tax-exempt bonds. ADFA, however, had no regulator and no legislative oversight. The governor could appoint the board and had the right to approve or disapprove every bond issue. POM president and co-owner Seth Ward’s brother-in-law, Webster “Webb” Hubbell, who served on POM’s board during the early 80s, co-wrote the documents which created the ADFA in 1985. Later Webb Hubbell would become a partner in the Rose Law Firm, which employed Hillary Clinton, and which eventually was at the center of the Whitewater scandal. Hillary Clinton, representing the Rose Law Firm, had also successfully defended Systematics, a subsidiary of Stephens Inc, during Stephen’s and Adham’s hostile takeover of Financial General. Clinton appointed Hubbell as the Associate Attorney General, the number-three position in the Justice Department, but he later resigned under questions about his role in Whitewater, and a question about the million dollars owned by POM to the Rose firm, not only shielding him from other accusations related to Whitewater, but also serving to get POM out of the headlines. The names of Hubbell and the Rose law firm appear on the bond issues and loan agreements for the largest contributions to Clinton’s presidential campaign. The banks, which extended several loans of more than three million, were all owned by a company named Stephens Inc., which was also a primary underwriter of ADFA bonds. In 1992, Stephen’s Worthen Bank of Little Rock, Arkansas, made a timely, and much needed, two million dollar loan to the primary campaign of the then future president, Bill Clinton. 31 Part of Stephens’ laundering worked through front companies set up by bond broker Dan Lasater, of Lasater & Company, the principle bond underwriter for the ADFA. Lasater had first made his fortune founding Ponderosa, a steakhouse chain that went public in 1971, and then moved to Little Rock. He had close ties with Bill Clinton, through his friendship with Clinton’s mother and half-brother, Roger. In 1982 he was one of the biggest contributors to Clinton’s election campaign, when he won back the governorship after a term out of office. Terry Reed alleges in court documents, and in his recent book, Compromised: Clinton, Bush and the CIA, that Barry Seal made deposits of cash from the Mena drug operation directly to Lasater & Co."},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 238 The Mujahideen Ultimately, the primary purpose of the BCCI, and the reason behind its meteoric rise, was its connection to the ISI, and the Mujahideen fighting the Soviet Union in Afghanistan. After Zia replaced Bhutto as Pakistan’s president, he appointed his friend Fazle Haq to be the governor of Pakistan’s North-West Frontier Province in 1978. This is the area that borders Afghanistan, through which tons of drugs and weapons were smuggled over the Khyber Pass. Fazle Haq was an important friend and backer of BCCI’s founder Hasan Abedi, and the BCCI was used to launder untold millions of ISI narcotics revenues. 32 Under National Security Directive 3, signed by President Reagan in 1982, Vice President George Bush was placed in charge of the entire global covert action program. It was Bush’s Special Situation Group (SSG), and Crisis Pre-Planning Group (CPPG), at the White House, that employed Oliver North, Richard Secord, “Public Diplomacy” head Walter Raymond, and the entire Iran-Contra operators. Throughout the 1980s, the Afghan War was the largest single program under this Bush chain of command. 33 As indicated by a series of articles in the October 13, 1995, issue of the Executive Intelligence Review, titled “the Anglo-American support apparatus behind the Afghani mujahideen”, the City of London also played a leading role in promoting the Afghan “Jihad”. Following the Soviet invasion, Lord Nicholas Bethell, a career British Intelligence agent, and close friend of British double agent Kim Philby, formed Radio Free Kabul, as a voice for the Mujahideen. Other members included Winston Churchill III, former Foreign Secretary Baron Chalfont, Lord Morrison of Lambeth, the former head of the Foreign Office, and British Intelligence official Ray Whitney. In 1981, Lord Bethell accompanied Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on a tour of the U.S. to drum up support for the resistance, leading to the creation of the Committee for a Free Afghanistan (CFA). The CFA’s funding came largely from the neo-conservative Heritage Foundation, which is part of the Tavistock Institute network, directed by British Intelligence. 34 The list of CFA’s Council of Advisers included Gen. John Singlaub, the former president of World Anti-Communist League, who was deeply involved in various Iran- Contra operations; former U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency head Gen. Daniel Graham; former Reagan-Bush administration National Security Adviser Richard V. Allen. Other members of its advisory council included Washington Times editor Arnaud de Borchgrave, whose cousin Alexander de Marenches was then running French intelligence; and two known CIA operatives, Louis Dupree and Thomas Goutierre. 35 Another British creation was the Afghan Relief Committee (ARC), established in 1980 by Wall Street investment banker and spy John Train. From its inception, the ARC worked closely with Freedom House, chaired by Leo Cherne, and which was has also included among its board"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"Guns, Drugs and Jihad 239 of trustees, Zbigniew Brzezinski and Samuel Huntington, author of The Clash of Civilizations. Founders of the ARC also included four former U.S. ambassadors to Afghanistan: Francis L. Kellogg, a decades-long associate of Train; Train’s cousin, Sen. Claiborne Pell; and again Louis Dupree and Thomas Gouttierre. Neo-conservative Jeane Kirkpatrick, later the Reagan administration ambassador to the U.N., also of Freedom House, was co- chairman of the group. Among the main known financial beneficiaries of the group were Doctors Without Borders. Also operative were Leo Cherne’s International Rescue Committee (IRC); the National Endowment for Democracy (NED); and the State Department’s Agency for International Development. CIA director William Casey was on the IRC’s board of directors, and had served as its president at one time. Leo Cherne was then vice-director of the President’s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board (PFIAB), with offices at the White House. Deeply involved in providing safe haven for the Afghan Mujahideen, and facilitating their dispersal throughout the world, was Ismaili Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan, the second son of the hereditary Imam of the Ismailis. In the 50s, Prince Sadruddin had become publisher of the Paris Review, an important British intelligence operation at the time, which was active promoting the Children of the Sun, the Dionysian cult, comprised of the children of Britain’s Roundtable elites. John Train, who was then the managing editor of the publication, had been Prince Sadruddin’s roommate at Harvard. Prince Sadruddin was made coordinator of the U.N. Humanitarian and Economic Assistance Programs for Afghanistan, working with John Train, in what was code-named Operation Salam, which was officially intended to organize the repatriation of Afghan refugees after the Soviet withdrawal. Prince Sadruddin’s program also reportedly was involved in the military training and covert military supply of the Mujahideen, who often operated out of U.N. refugee camps that he administered on the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. 36 Prince Sadruddin has also been a key figure in Prince Philip’s World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), which, according to the EIR, is “the British royal family’s most important intelligence agency”. 37 Since its creation in 1961, Prince Sadruddin has been one of is primary funders, as has his nephew, the current leader of the Ismailis. Through his London-based Aga Khan Foundation, and the Geneva-based Bellerive Foundation, he has emerged as a top figure in the environmental movement. In 1983, the WWF successfully persuaded the Pakistani government to create two national parks directly on the Afghan border, renowned for the quality and abundance of its opium poppy, which was assiduously cultivated by the Mujahideen. It was also a primary staging area for smuggling arms into Afghanistan. Prior to the Soviet-Afghan war, opium production in Afghanistan and Pakistan was channelled to small regional markets. There was no local production of heroin. According to Alfred McCoy, however, within two years"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 240 of the CIA operation in Afghanistan, border between Pakistan and Afghanistan became the world’s top heroin producer, supplying sixty percent of U.S. demand. In Pakistan, the heroin-addict population went from near zero in 1979, to 1.2 million by 1985, a much steeper rise than in any other nation. CIA assets again controlled this heroin trade, but once the heroin left Pakistan’s laboratories, the Sicilian mafia managed its export to the U.S., which it distributed to street gangs through a chain of pizza parlors, according to the DEA.’ 38 Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, who was leading recipient of CIA funding among the Mujahideen groups, and affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood, was at the center of the drug trade laundered through BCCI to fund the Mujahideen campaign. According to journalist Tim Weiner, “[Hekmatyar’s] followers first gained attention by throwing acid in the faces of women who refused to wear the veil. CIA and State Department officials I have spoken with call him “scary,” “vicious,” “a fascist,” “definite dictatorship material.” 39 Over time it has emerged that Hekmatyar was not only an ISI asset, who laundered his money through BCCI, but that he also cooperated with the KGB to ensure his status as the most powerful warlord among many rivals.

The lowest ranks may sincerely believe they are defending Islam, and confronting “Western imperialism”. However, these various terrorist groups, though representing different factions, are part of a single network serving the same Illuminati cause. When we explore the political and financial connections of the terrorists, we find that these are not merely wayward fanatics, operating in isolation, but that their channels penetrate to the upper reaches of power, in the British and American governments, and outward into the nether regions of the occult and criminal underworlds. Svali, a former member of the cult, the Illuminati “.... are truly an international group, and the group’s agenda supersedes any nationalistic feelings.” 1 That members of this network could share a common goal, despite adhering to apparently conflicting ideologies and religious creeds, is explained by the fact that the Illuminati believe there is no truth. This reality, according to them, is too difficult to handle for all but the “elite”. As for the masses, however, they require religion. It is therefore perceived as necessary by the Illuminati to don the façade of religion to lead them. As Robert Dreyfuss clarifies: The real Muslim Brothers are those whose hands are never dirtied with the business of killing and burning. They are the secretive bankers and financiers who stand behind the curtain, the members of the old Arab, Turkish, or Persian families whose genealogy places them in the oligarchical elite, with smooth business and intelligence associations to the European black nobility and, especially, to the British oligarchy. And the Muslim Brotherhood is money. Together, the Brotherhood probably controls several tens of billions of dollars in immediate liquid assets, and controls billions more in day-to-day business operations in everything from oil trade and banking to drug-running, illegal arms merchandising, and gold and diamond smuggling.

Exercised through the Muslim Brotherhood, it would reach to the Afghan exile communities in Europe, North Africa, other parts of the Islamic world, and America. The recruitment drive to attract Muslims from all parts of the world was of course a pretext. The Mujahideen were able to attract but a few thousand volunteers. In reality, the recruitment effort was aimed at indoctrinating an international pool of terrorists to serve beyond the war in Afghanistan, to be later used to instigate the phony War on Terror. For the meantime, these would be regarded as “Freedom Fighters”, but the war in Afghanistan provided the Illuminati the opportunity to mobilize an international army of terrorist recruits, whose directives would later be changed to attack the US. The prime recruiting ground for these dupes, of course, was the bastion of that fanatical version of Islam created by the British in the eighteenth century, Saudi Arabia, a country now which, following the orchestration of the oil crisis, was in a financial position to fund these covert operations on behalf of their co-conspirators in London and Washingston. To solicit Saudi Arabia’s support, Casey contacted Bandar, who arranged a meeting with King Fahd, as a result of which the Saudis, funneled through the BCCI, would match “America dollar for dollar supporting the Mujahideen,” according to Prince Turki al Faisal, longtime head of Saudi intelligence. 3 Besides ridding themselves of an increasingly volatile section of the population, according to Craig Unger, the war in Afghanistan was: ...a mission that could be embraced by the gamut of Saudi society, from the wealthy merchant families and the House of Saud to the militant clerics and the fundamentalist masses. For the royal family, the war was not just part of the cornerstone of the burgeoning Saudi alliance with the United States, but served other purposes as well. Contributing to the war effort placated the militant clerics and helped accommodate the growing unrest and the more radical elements of society. 4 The ISI requested the presence of a Saudi prince to lead the “Jihad” in Afghanistan. While no volunteers were forthcoming, the Saudi leaders recommended the scion of a wealthy family that was close to the monarchy, Osama bin Laden. He was dispatched to the Pakistan border, arriving there just in time to hear Brzezinski, donning a turban, shout “Allah is on your side”."},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"Al Qaeda 243 But, while Osama was responsible for the organization and training of new recruits, it was Sheikh Abdullah Azzam who formulated the ideological argument, according to Islamic law, in order to justify the war in Afghanistan as “Jihad”, by which recruits were to be motivated to serve American interests against the Soviets. Barnett R Rubin, a Columbia University associate professor, and senior fellow at the CFR, says sources have told him that Abdullah Azzam was “enlisted” by the CIA. 5 Unrelated to the Egyptian Azzams, Azzam was a Palestinian-born teacher of religion, and an active member of the Muslim Brotherhood in the West Bank. Later, he pursued an education in Jordan and Damascus before receiving his doctorate in Islamic jurisprudence from Cairo’s Al Azhar University in 1973. While in Cairo, Azzam met the family of Sayed Qutb. 6 Thereafter, he moved to Saudi Arabia, after being invited to teach at King Abdul Aziz University, where he linked up with Sayed Qutb’s brother Mohammed. Mohammed Qutb, like many in the Muslim Brotherhood, had emigrated under CIA sponsorship to Saudi Arabia during Nasser’s crackdown. 7 He was given different official positions at Saudi universities to teach and to carry out the mission of the Muslim Brotherhood. While in Saudi Arabia, Mohammed Qutb conceived of the organization now known as the World Assembly of Muslim Youth (WAMY), which was established in 1972, thanks to large donations from the bin Laden family. Osama’s brother Omar was at one time its executive director, and another brother, Abdullah, who also served as a director, was being investigated as a source of terrorist funding until the Bush administration halted the FBI’s investigation at the beginning of his term in 2001. 8 Like Abdul Wahhab, and typical of all Muslim Brotherhood ideology, Azzam depended on an interpretation of Islamic law derived from Ibn Taymiyyah. In Ibn Taymiyyah’s time, the Islamic world had come under the sway of the Mongols. Despite the fact that the Mongol invaders had accepted Islam, Ibn Taymiyyah insisted that their religion was tainted, and therefore that they were unbelievers. By categorizing the Mongol rulers as infidel invaders, Ibn Taymiyyah argued that it was obligatory for the Muslims to fight them. Azzam employed similar arguments, claiming that once a Muslim land is invaded, the Muslims of the world must unite to defend it. Ultimately, what Azzam did was to convince his Muslim brethren that, despite the rampant corruption in their own countries, it was incumbent upon them to fight the unholy infidels in far away Afghanistan, omitting the fact that it was not a Muslim country, but had already been subjected to Communism. Azzam, however, was finally assassinated in a car bomb attack in late 1989. Some US intelligence officials believe bin Laden ordered the killing. 9"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 244 Osama Bin Laden Osama bin Laden’s father, Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden, emigrated from Yemen to Saudi Arabia as a bricklayer, and slowly built the largest Saudi construction firm. He established a close relationship with Ibn Saud, who asked him to rebuild the sacred city of Mecca. Ever since, the bin Ladens have been responsible for construction in Mecca and Medina. After Mohammed’s death in a plane crash in 1967, his sons built the Saudi BinLaden Group into a multibillion-dollar enterprise. Recent ventures have included building a freeway around Riyadh, expanding King Khaled Airport, and constructing a base for U.S. troops. By the late 70s, Osama was running the business. As points out John K. Cooley, an ABC News correspondent, and Middle East specialist: Through his own personal reputation as a pious Muslim who favoured the cause of Wahabi Islamism, and through involvement of the bin Laden companies in construction and renovation at the holy shrines of Mecca and Medina, he seemed to both Saudi Intelligence and the CIA an ideal choice for the leading role he began to play. Bin Laden began to pay, with his own company and funds, for recruitment, transportation and training of the Arab volunteers who flocked, first to Peshawar, and to Afghanistan... By 1895 bin Laden had collected enough millions from his family and company wealth... to oragnize al Qaida. 10 While attending King Abdul Aziz University in Jeddah, Osama bin Laden also became close to Mohammed Qutb, and was initiated into the Muslim Brotherhood. 11 Osama had also attended Azzam’s classes and was caught up into his militant ideology. In 1979, Azzam left Saudi Arabia, being one of the first Arabs to join the Afghan jihad, and Osama, at just twenty-two years of age, followed soon after, leading them to found the MAK, or “Maktab al- Khidamat”, or the Mujahideen Services Bureau, based in Peshawar, Pakistan. According to John Loftus, however, it was George Bush Sr., as vice president, who was in charge of the covert operations that supported the MAK. 12 The MAK was nurtured by Pakistan’s ISI, and linked up with Pakistan’s Muslim Brotherhood organization, the Jamaat-e Islami, founded by Abul Ala Maududi, to recruit fighters. By the late 1980s, there were branches of the MAK in fifty countries around the world, by means of which unsuspecting dupes from around the globe poured in to fight “Jihad” in Afghanistan. Azzam and bin Laden then recognized that many of the prospective Mujahideen lacked training, and established the Bayt Al-Ansar in Peshawar, as a central training base, or Al Qaeda, founded with the assistance of the resident CIA chief in Peshawar. 13 Bin Laden had made the first of many contacts with the CIA in 1979, after graduating from university in Jeddah, when he went to Istanbul, which the American intelligence center had chosen as a way station for the volunteers. 14 "},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"Al Qaeda 245 When the Americans decided to change the tide of the war, Osama was brought to the US under the false name of “Tim Osman”. Osama then met with three men in Sherman Oaks, California. Among them was Ted Gunderson, a retired FBI agent, who had been approached by a high-level official in the administration of President Ronald Reagan to provide, outside of government channels, assistance to the Afghan Mujahideen. In 1986, Gunderson then arranged a meeting between himself, Riconosciuto, and Ralph Olberg. Michael Riconosciuto was architect of the Promis software who was closely involved with Hubbell’s Park-on-Meter operation. Olberg covertly represented the State Department where he served on its Middle East desk. 5 Gunderson’s role was to put the key players in contact with Sir Dennis Kendall, a former member of the British parliament, and a double agent during World War II, who had worked for both the Germans and the British. After leaving Gunderson in California, Riconosciuto, bin Laden, Olberg and Kendall traveled to Boston, where they met with Abdullah Azzam, and details of the aid plan were further formulated. Interpol provided secure communications and kept the operation, formalized with a number of unnamed congressmen, from being compromised or discovered. 6 The project ultimately provided the Afghani resistance with 600 stinger surface-to-air, shoulder-fired missiles, which had been modified so they could not be used against American aircraft if captured. Gunderson confirmed that these weapons turned the tide of battle in Afghanistan against the Soviets, whose aircraft, and particularly attack helicopters, fell victim to the missiles. 7 America’s support of the Mujahideen, even included, as revealed by John Cooley, a former journalist with the US ABC, and author of Unholy Wars: Afghanistan, America and International Terrorism, training inside the US. Training included rifle shooting at the High Rock gun club in Naugtuck, Connecticut. More technical training took place at the CIA’s Camp Peary, nicknamed “The Farm,” in Virginia. Among the topics that were covered were surveillance and counter surveillance, counter-terrorism, counter-narcotics and paramilitary operations. Michael Springman, the head of the American visa bureau in Jeddah from 1987 to 1989, told the BBC: In Saudi Arabia I was repeatedly ordered by high-level State Department officials to issue visas to unqualified applicants. People who had no ties either to Saudi Arabia or to their own country. I complained there. I complained here in Washington to Main Street, to the inspector general, and to Diplomatic Security, and I was ignored... What I was doing was giving visas to terrorists – recruited by the CIA and Osama bin Laden to come back to the United States for training to be used in the war in Afghanistan against the then Soviets. 8 A former U.S. Army Sergeant, Ali Mohamed, testified in a New York court that he helped train members of Al Qaeda after he left the army"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 246 in 1989. An Egyptian, Ali Mohamed rose to the rank of major his country’s Special Forces. In 1984, he was expelled from Egypt’s military as a religious extremist. He contacted the CIA, offering to act as a spy, but the CIA judged him unreliable. He was later placed on a U.S. government watch list, and yet was able to obtain a U.S. visa, marry an American woman, and become an American citizen. Until 1989, he was lecturing on the Middle East at the U.S. Army’s John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School at Fort Bragg. In 2000, he admitted involvement in the bombing of the embassies in Africa. Though his relationship with the FBI and the CIA remain shrouded in secrecy, a close friend of his, obstetrician Ali Zaki, stated, “everyone in the community knew he was working as a liaison between the CIA and the Afghan cause.” 9 In 1988, while still on active duty, he visited Afghanistan on leave, where he fought the Soviets and made contact with Osama bin Laden, apparently with CIA sponsorship. After Mohamed was honorably discharged in 1989, he joined the Reserves for another five years. Documents from U.S. court cases demonstrate that while either on active duty or a member of the Reserves, he continued to travel abroad to meet with Osama bin Laden and his colleagues, as well as training al Qaeda members within the U.S. Retired Lt. Col. Robert Anderson, who was at Fort Bragg testified that, as nothing was done after he had advised his superiors of Mohamed’s activities, he was forced to conclude that Mohamed was “sponsored” by U.S. intelligence. 10 Mohamed Ali returned to California in the mid 1990s, where he helped Zawahiri raise money for the Egyptian Islamic Jihad. 11 Finally, even Ayman al Zawahiri, the alleged “number two man” in Al Qaeda, was part of several dubious associations. Zawahiri is a member of another Muslim Brotherhood organization, Islamic Jihad, founded in 1977, which had been discovered responsible for the assassination of Sadat. Zawahiri was one of the men charged in the plot. Zawahiri is also related to the family of the Azzams. His grandmother was the sister of the renowned Abdul Rahman Azzam, while his uncle was Salem Azzam. After he fled Egypt, he based his operations in Geneva, working under the cover of the Muslim Brotherhood- controlled Islamic Center, led by Said Ramadan. The Sudan, Bosnia and the Philippines At the end of 1989, Osama bin Laden returned to Saudi Arabia. Although, when the Gulf War broke out in 1990, he became an outspoken critic of the setting up of US bases in the country, which had been permitted by the Saudi family. Bin Laden decided to leave Saudi Arabia in 1991, going first to Pakistan and back to Afghanistan, before finally settling in Sudan, when General Omar Hassan al-Bashir took power in a military coup. Just a few months later, at the Muslim Brotherhood meeting in London in 1989, it was decided that Sudan would be"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"Al Qaeda 247 a new base for the Islamist movement, and a Muslim Brotherhood leadership council of nineteen members was subsequently established in Khartoum under Turabi, who would emerge as the real power in the Sudanese regime. 12 Hassan al-Turabi, born in 1932, joined the Muslim Brotherhood while studying law at the British-run Gordon College in Khartoum. He received a master’s degree from the University of London, and then attended the Sorbonne University in France, receiving his doctorate in 1964. According to bin Laden biographer Roland Jacquard, Turabi visited London in 1992 and was a guest at the Royal Institute of International Affairs. In addition, Turabi seems to have Masonic connections. When their relationship had broken down, and after Turabi had foiled an attempted coup by he and his party, Bashir denounced him as being sponsored by “Zionists and freemasons”. 13 According to several authoritative sources, as the war was winding down in Afghanistan, leaders of the CIA in Peshawar held secret meetings with bin Laden, at the end of 1991, at Green’s Hotel, under the authority of Prince Turki al Faisal, the head of Saudi intelligence. It was agreed to maintain the valuable collaboration of the “Afghan” Mujahideen, though the exact substance of the meeting is not known. 14 Consequently, many of the fighters who had trained and volunteered in Afghanistan were removed to Sudan. With support from his family, Osama extended large loans to the Islamic regime, in exchange for which the Binladen Group launched a great infrastructure construction project, including the building of highways, bridges, airports, and luxury residences. Bin Laden also continued to finance training camps, for which he often returned to Afghanistan. On each of these visits he met with the CIA experts. 15 Together with weapons shipments to Sudan, bin Laden also managed an opium supply chain that was established before he departed for Afghanistan with Hekmatyar. 16 The DEA confirms having received multi-source information that Bin Laden has been involved in the financing and facilitation of heroin trafficking activities. 17 Al Qaeda reportedly earns as much as six billion a year from drug- trafficking. 18 In Bosnia, where al Qaeda Mujahideen collaborated with the US, the militants established connections with Bosnian organized crime figures. The officials said al Qaeda and the Taliban found a route for the trafficking of heroin from Afghanistan into Europe through the Balkans. 19 Followers also have been tied to bank robberies, holdups, credit card fraud and other crimes. 20 Bin Laden had also pushed early funding through the International Islamic Relief Organization (IIRO), as arranged in meetings between al Qaeda’s inner-circle and the charity’s directors. Al-Zawahiri was employed by the IIRO in Albania. The Philippine branch office was run by Osama’s brother-in-law, who made a hand-off of cash to the terrorist group Abu Sayyaf, an al Qaeda offshoot. The Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG), was co-founded by Edwin Angeles, who also went by the Muslim name of “Ibrahim Yakub”, an undercover agent for the Defense Intelligence Group, who, as the ASG’s operations officer and chief recruiter, was largely responsible for the spread and criminalization of"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 248 the group. Filipina television news reporter, Arlyn de la Cruz, in her history of the ASG, wrote that Angeles/Yakub “holds the key to the deep intricacies of how some government agencies manipulated the rawness of the Abu Sayyaf during its early years.” 21 WTC Bombing On November 5, 1990, in New York City, Meir Kahane, the founder of the terroristic Jewish Defense League (JDL), was assassinated by an Arab assailant. Kahane had been elected to the Knesset, the Israeli parliament, in 1884, by advocating the expulsion of all Arabs from Israel, but was subsequently barred from office after a new law banned parties that had racist platforms. Essentially, the history of the JDL and its founder indicates that the JDL functioned as an arm of the Mossad. Kahane’s biographer, Robert Friedman, revealed that “high-ranking members of Mossad” were directing Kahane, and that the “central player” was former Mossad operations chief, Yitzhak Shamir. 22 Kahane had also been an asset of the FBI and the CIA, including a stint for the CIA in Africa, as a “news correspondent.” In 1965, under the name “Michael King,” Kahane and Joseph Churba formed a group to mobilize campus support for the Vietnam War, as part of a CIA operation “working both sides” of the Vietnam War issue, simultaneously funding anti-war groups. In 1968, Michael King became Rabbi Meir Kahane. His colleague, Churba, also a rabbi, was a key liaison between the Likudnik right-wing in Israel and neo-conservatives in Washington. 23 Churba became an influential asset for Israeli intelligence in U.S. foreign policy-making circles, having been promoted by the John Birch Society, and funded by CIA-backed Korean cult leader Sun Myung Moon. 24 The man accused of assassinating Kahane was El Sayed Nosair, one of dozens of Arabs who had spent time at the Al Kifah Refugee Center in Brooklyn, where the CIA had once recruited prospects to join the Afghan Jihad in the eighties. According to the February 1993 issue of the newsletter, Inside Israel, Kahane’s son claimed that “both the FBI and Mossad had infiltrated the group to which Nosair belonged.” As reported by Jane Hunter, for the Middle East International, “Benyamin Kahane says he was told by an FBI informant he identifies as Mustafa Shalabi that Nosair’s brother worked for the FBI.” 25 Shalabi, a former colleague of Sheik Omar Abdul Rahman, later turned up dead. Files found in Nosair’s possession gave details of a terrorist cell, mention al Qaeda, and discuss the destruction of tall US buildings, but were not translated until years later. Instead, within twelve hours of the assassination, New York police declared the assassination was the work of a “lone gunman”, and stuck with that story. At Nosair’s trial, to which Bin Laden contributed for the defense, prosecutors chose nevertheless not to introduce his incriminating possessions as evidence, nor was his confession even mentioned, and a"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"Al Qaeda 249 supposedly “open-and-shut case” ended with an acquittal. However, Nosair was sentenced to twenty-two years on other lesser charges. 26 Many of those involved in Kahane’s assassination later planned the 1993 WTC. As one FBI agent put it, “the fact is that in 1990, myself and my detectives, we had in our office in handcuffs, the people who blew up the World Trade Center in ‘93. We were told to release them.” 27 Evidence found in Nosair’s apartment linked him to the “Blind Sheikh”, Omar Abdur Rahman. Curiously, despite Sheikh Omar’s link to Nosair, a formal investigation was not undertaken. During the war in Afghanistan, Abdur Rahman had made frequent trips to Peshawar in Pakistan, where he was a friend of Abdullah Azzam. Sheikh Omar was known to have befriended bin Laden while in Afghanistan, and bin Laden secretly paid Abdul-Rahman’s US living expenses. 28 Though he had been tied to the assassination of Anwar Sadat, the CIA nevertheless regarded him as a valuable asset, because they saw his anti-Western polemics as successful in uniting the Mujahideen forces. According to Peter Bergen’s Holy War, Inc., even though the Blind Sheikh was known to be the leader of the Gamat al Islamiyya, the radical offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood, he had been issued a visa in 1987 and 1990. 29 As one FBI agent said in 1993, he is “hands-off.... It was no accident that the sheikh got a visa and that he’s still in the country. He’s here under the banner of national security, the State Department, the NSA, and the CIA.” 30 The charge that Sheik Omar Abdur Rahman operated with CIA sanction has come from a number of sources, including an anonymous government official, who leaked that it was a CIA officer assigned as a consular official that approved the Sheik’s visa from the Sudan after the consulate approved it, according to the New York Times on July 14, 1993. Egyptian President Mubarak suggested that the visa had been issued to Rahman as a payoff for “services” rendered. “The sheikh has been a CIA agent since his days in Afghanistan,” Mubarak told Egypt’s al-Gomhuria newspaper. “He still earns a salary.” 31 Specifically, according to Barnett R Rubin, a Columbia University associate professor, and senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, Abdur Rahman received the visa for having gone to Peshawar on behalf of the CIA, soon after Azzam was killed, “to preach to the Afghans about the necessity of unity to overthrow the Kabul regime.” 32 Also according to Rubin, not long after the sheikh was arrested, a source asked Robert Oakley, former U.S. Ambassador to Pakistan, how the U.S. would respond if the sheikh disclosed he had worked for the CIA. Oakley laughed, saying it would never happen, because the admission would ruin the sheikh’s credibility with his militant followers. 33 In the wake of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, thousands of suspected terrorists were rounded up and jailed, among them were Omar Abdul Rahman, who was eventually convicted of a conspiracy to blow up New York City landmarks. Emad Salem, the Egyptian bodyguard for Sheikh Rahman,"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 250 and the key witness in the trial, was an FBI informant. It was eventually revealed under questioning that Mr. Salem had received a quarter million to one million dollars for his services as an FBI informant. Salem testified that the FBI knew about the attack beforehand and told him they would thwart it by substituting a harmless powder for the explosives. However, this plan was called off by an FBI supervisor, and the bombing was not stopped. 34 Defense attorney William Kunstler investigated and discovered that not only was Salem a lieutenant colonel in the Egyptian army, he never stopped working for the Egyptian government. Apart from the FBI, Salem was also funded, according to Kunstler, by other sources linked to foreign governments, including money from an organization founded by Rabbi Meir Kahane. 35 Renegade Mossad agent, Victor Ostrovsky, who left Israel’s secret police agency and wrote his best-selling book, By Way of Deception, told the Village Voice that Israeli intelligence may have been behind the World Trade Center bombing. Mossad had motive and opportunity, says Ostrovsky, though he readily admits he doesn’t have “a shred of evidence” to support his theory. Ostrovsky says that the Mossad would have infiltrated the radical mosques in New Jersey and Brooklyn, where Abdul Rahman preached and disciples like El Sayyid Nosair prayed, and almost certainly recruited a close associate of the Blind Sheikh. The insider is recruited in what Ostrovsky calls a “false flag operation.” The Arab “thinks he is being recruited by an Iranian agent or a Libyan,” says Ostrovsky. He never suspects he is actually being “run” by Mossad. 36 Ostrovsky points out that in the past the Mossad has effectively used this modus operandi. In the early 1950s, Mossad recruited agents to bomb American buildings in Cairo, hoping to drive a wedge between the U.S. and Nasser. When the facts became known in Israel, the scandal brought down the government. According to Ostrovsky, in 1984 Mossad detonated bombs outside of the U.S. embassy in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia’s capital city, claiming credit in the name of an unknown radical Saudi resistance group. A member of Mossad at the time, Ostrovsky says the purpose was to weaken U.S./Saudi relations, by demonstrating to the U.S. that the regime was fragile and about to fall. 37 As reported by Robert Friedman, Ahmad Ajaj, of the men accused of conspiring to bomb the World Trade Center, may have been a Mossad mole, according to Israeli intelligence sources. The FBI had identified Ajaj as a senior Intifada activist in the occupied territories, having close ties to both El Fatah, a constituent group of the PLO, and Hamas. According to federal sources and the Israeli National Police, the Israeli military expelled him to Jordan in 1991, for conspiring to smuggle weapons to El Fatah on the West Bank. However, according to Kol Ha’ir, a highly regarded weekly in Jerusalem, Ajaj was never involved in Intifada activities, or with the PLO, or Hamas. Citing court papers and other sources, Kol Ha’ir related that Ajaj was actually a small-time crook, and that during his prison stay, after having been sentenced in 1988 for counterfeiting U.S. dollars, he was apparently recruited"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"Al Qaeda 251 by Mossad. Curiously, following his release, only a year later, he had seemingly undergone a radical transformation, and became a devout Muslim. 38 It was soon after that when he was arrested for smuggling weapons into the West Bank, allegedly for El Fatah. However, Israeli intelligence sources say that the arrest for weapons smuggling, and Ajaj’s supposed torture and deportation, were staged by Mossad to establish his credentials as an intifada activist. Mossad allegedly “tasked” Ajaj to infiltrate radical Palestinian groups operating outside Israel. Israeli intelligence sources say that it is not unusual for Mossad to recruit from the ranks of common criminals. 39 Ramzi Yousef, the bomb plot’s mastermind, proclaimed at his sentencing hearing in January 1998, “Yes, I am a terrorist and proud of it as long as it is against the U.S. government.” While it is expected that men like Youssef would be opposed to many of the actions of US imperialism and its overt support of Israeli aggression, it is unfortunate that they could not channel their dissent otherwise, rather than being duped into serving their enemies, and helping to undermine the very religion they naively claim to serve."},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 252"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"253 Texas In 1999, the French Parliament commissioned an extensive and thorough investigation of global money-laundering. After publishing reports on Liechtenstein, Monaco and Switzerland, it also produced a report titled, The City of London, Gibraltar and the Crown Dependencies: Offshore Centers and Havens for Dirty Money, part of which was an addendum titled, The Economic Environment of Osama bin Laden. The report concluded that up to forty British banks, companies and individuals were associated with bin Laden’s network, including organizations in London, Oxford, Cheltenham, Cambridge and Leeds. 1 In introducing the report, Arnaud Montebourg, a French Member of Parliament concluded, “Tony Blair, and his government, preaches around the world against terrorism. He would be well advised to preach to his own bankers and oblige them to go after dirty money... Even the Swiss co-operate more than the English.” 2 Implicated in the report was Khalid bin Mahfouz, the largest shareholder of BCCI, and important figure within the Saudi government, with extensive business ties to the Bush family and the CIA. Nevertheless, representatives of bin Mahfouz later managed to argue that the report was in fact prepared by Jean-Charles Brisard, author of Forbidden Truth, and not French intelligence. Bin Mahouz has begun libel proceedings against Brisard, claiming that he has made unfounded and defamatory allegations. 3 Similarly, bin Mahfouz has also successfully acquired retractions from Fortune Magazine, the Washington Post and USA Today, for allegations he had ties with terrorist financing. James Woolsey, former Director of CIA, testified to a congressional sub-committee, that Khalid Bin Mahfouz was bin Laden’s brother-in-law, but when it was found that he had mispronounced the name, he was forced to retract his statement, claiming that he was no longer sure if the information he was provided was accurate. Nevertheless, the authors of Forbidden Truth provide the following information which is accurate: 26 : Dollars for Terror"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 254 Khalid bin Mahfouz was a key figure in the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, or BCCI, affair. Between 1986 and 1990, he was a top executive there, holding the position of operational director. His family held a 20 percent share in the bank at the time. He was charged in the United States in 1992 with tax fraud in the bank’s collapse. In 1995, held jointly liable in the BCCI’s collapse, he agreed to a $245 million settlement to pay the bank’s creditors, allowing them to indemnify a portion of the bank’s clients. The specific charges against the bank were embezzlement and violation of American, Luxembourg and British banking laws. 4 In 2002, an investigation did find that charitable contributions had been made by bin Mahfouz for the purpose of funding bin Laden. 5 Nevertheless, bin Mahfouz had maintained close business relationships with the Bush family. First of all, during the 1980’s, bin Mahfouz’s banking syndicate performed major CIA-inspired banking operations for such former CIA assets as Osama bin Laden, as well as for Saddam Hussein, Manuel Noriega and other drug dealing generals, such as in Pakistan. 6 However, when Salem bin Laden, head of the wealthy Saudi Arabian family, and one of seventeen brothers to Osama bin Laden, died in 1988, Khalid bin Mahfouz inherited his interests in Houston. Salem was described by a French secret intelligence report as one of two closest friends of Saudi Arabia’s King Fahd, who often performs important missions for Saudi Arabia. 7 Salem’s sole U.S. business representative had been James Bath, who then ran a business for bin Mahfouz, and joined a partnership with he and Gaith Pharaon, BCCI’s frontman in Houston. James Bath had extensive ties both to the bin Laden family and major players in the BCCI. Time magazine described Bath, in 1991, as “a deal broker whose alleged associations run from the CIA to a major shareholder and director of the Bank of Credit & Commerce.” 8 Bath was recruited in 1976 by then CIA Director, George Herbert Bush, to create offshore companies to move CIA funds and aircraft between Texas and Saudi Arabia. 9 One of James Bath’s former business partners, Charles W. “Bill” White, a former Annapolis graduate and United States Navy pilot, claimed that Bath was involved in a secret conspiracy to funnel Saudi money into the United States. He also claimed that, since 1976, Bath had worked as a CIA liaison to Saudi Arabia. Until the early 90s, Bath was also involved with Bin Mahfouz in their company, Southwest Airport Services, refuelers of the presidential plane, Air Force One, when the president was in Houston. 10 Bath also operated Skyway Aircraft Leasing Ltd., an aviation business based in the Cayman Islands, owned by bin Mahfouz. First, within a month of its incorporation, the temporary board at Cotopax named Bath as company president, changed the company name to Skyways and then resigned en mass, leaving Bath as a sole director. One of the original subscribers to Cotopax, a company called Cayhaven Corporate Services, Ltd., was also a subscriber"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"Dollars for Terror 255 to “I.C., Inc.”. In reality, IC Inc. was the same entity as ICIC, which is the International Credit and Investment Corporation of Grand Caymans, termed BCCI’s “bank-within-a-bank” in the Kerry Committee report. Thus, James Bath’s Skyways Aircraft Leasing is an enterprise related to Mahfouz’s BCCI via “IC Inc.” The company was found by investigators to be at the very center of a chart found in Oliver North’s White House safe, showing the banking network of the Iran-Contra operation. 11 Bath was a close family friend of George W. Bush. In the early 1970s, the two flew fighter jets together in the Texas Air National Guard. In 1979, Bush’s first business, Arbusto Energy, obtained financing from Bath. As one of many investors, including Bildeberger George Ball, Bath gave Bush fifty thousand dollars for a five percent stake in Arbusto. In the Outlaw Bank, Beaty and Gwynne suggest that Bath’s investment in Arbusto may have belonged to bin Mahfouz, since young George Bush “had no substantial money of his own at the time.” After several transformations, Arbusto emerged in 1986 as Harken Energy Corporation. The father of Harken’s chairman, Alan Quasha, was Manila-based attorney William Quasha, who advised executives of the defunct and scandal-ridden Nugan Hand Bank in Australia, which had employed a number of former high-ranking CIA and Pentagon officials. According to a 1983 Australian government report, and the Wall Street Journal, Nugan Hand Bank was involved in money laundering for international heroin syndicates and secretly aided U.S. covert activities, while former CIA director, William Colby, was its attorney. Some of the persons interacting with Nugan Hand Bank executives in the 1970s were later to become central figures in the Iran- Contra affair, such as Richard Secord, Casper Weinberger, who was later pardoned by former President Bush. 12 In 1987, when Harken ran into trouble, a 17.6 percent share was purchased by Saudi Sheik Abdullah Taha Bakhsh, a business partner with Pharaon, while his banker was bin Mahfouz. 13 Though Bush told the Wall Street Journal he had “no idea” BCCI was involved in Harken’s financial dealings, the network of connections between Bush and BCCI is so extensive that the Journal concluded by stating: “The number of BCCI-connected people who had dealings with Harken – all since George W. Bush came on board – raises the question of whether they mask an effort to cozy up to a presidential son.” 14 Or even the president: Bath finally came under investigation by the FBI in 1992 for his Saudi business relationships, accused of funnelling Saudi money through Houston, in order to influence the foreign policies of the Reagan and first Bush administrations. In 1987, the original plan for Harken Oil and Gas was to obtain 25 million dollars in investment capital from the Banque de Commerce et de Placements (BCP), a joint venture between the Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS) and BCCI, as the controlling interest. The managing director of BCP"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 256 was Dr. Hartmann. The financing was brokered by Dr. Hartmann and Bruce Rappaport. The InterMaritime Bank of Geneva and New York, which was affiliated with a global network of many Mahfouz-connected banks, around the Saudi National Commercial Bank, was also involved in multiple covert CIA operations. Rappaport, a golfing buddy of then CIA director William Casey’s, was deeply implicated in the BCCI affair, involving secret accounts for illegal arms sales to Iran, partnered with Oliver North. 15 Dr. Hartmann was also the chairman of the Swiss affiliate of yet another criminal bank, the Italian Banco Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL). According to the Congressional Record in 1992, BNL was alleged, by U.S. House Banking Committee Chairman Henry Gonzalez, to have secured billions of dollars in illegally-used, weapons-directed loans from the first Bush administration to Saddam Hussein just prior to Desert Storm. 16 Harken’s financing by BCP was structured by Jackson Stephens of Little Rock, which, according to the Asian Wall Street Journal, apparently did not comply with U.S. banking regulations. Finally, in the course of restructuring the deal, UBS decided to sell off its shares. Stephens found a new buyer for the UBS’s shares, Sheikh Abdullah Bakhsh. 17 According to the 1992 Senate BCCI investigation, however, the Bush Justice Department went to great lengths to block prosecution of BCCI. The Senate probe determined that federal officials repeatedly obstructed congressional and local investigations, and for three years impeded attempts by Robert Morgenthau, Manhattan district attorney, from obtaining critical information. The Senate investigation concluded that, in 1990 and 1991, the Bush Department, with Assistant Attorney General Robert Muller taking the lead, consistently put forward the mistaken impression that they were aggressively moving against the bank. However, the probe said the Justice Department was actually interfering with “the investigation of others through a variety of mechanisms, ranging from not making witnesses available, to not returning telephone calls, to claiming that every aspect of the case was under investigation in a period when little, if anything, was being done.” 18 More incriminating is the fact that, in 1996, French intelligence secretly monitored a meeting of Saudi billionaires at the Hotel Royale Monceaus in Paris, with the financial representative of al Qaeda, a key Saudi prince, and joined by Muslim and non-Muslim arms dealers, to determine by how much to pay off bin Laden. According to the author of Forbidden Truth, Jean-Charles Brisard and reporter Greg Palast, Sheikh Abdullah Bakhsh and Khalid bin Mahfouz were among approximately twenty people at the meeting, in addition to Prince Turki al Faisal, and Iran-Contra operative Adnan Khashoggi. Representatives of Mahfouz, however, deny his involvement, and that he has ever attended a meeting with representatives of al Qaeda. But again, Mahfouz has begun libel proceedings against Mr. Brisard, claiming his allegations are unfounded. 19"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"Dollars for Terror 257 The deal was that bin Laden not attack Saudi Arabia. This is an arrangement that purportedly dates back to 1991. In Why America Slept, Gerald Posner claims that a still classified US intelligence report describes that this secret arrangement had been established between bin Laden and Saudi intelligence minister, Prince Turki al-Faisal, the Saudi Intelligence Minister. 20 The participants also agreed that bin Laden should be rewarded for promoting Wahhabism in Chechnya, Kashmir, Bosnia, and other places. 21 The supposed “pay-off” is obviously an excuse to reward bin Laden for a “job well-done”. In this way, bin Laden can save face among his followers for failing to address the problems in Saudi Arabia, despite the egregious extremes of the royal family, and instead focus his invectives away from them, against the American “crusaders”. Bin Laden has therefore had to alter his rhetoric so as not to appear entirely hypocritical. As noted by Stephen Schwartz, in The Two Faces of Islam, of the content of his “Declaration of War Against America”, bin Laden’s complaints about the Saudis were “those of a critic, not a revolutionary enemy.” He continues: Throughout bin Laden’s writings, one had the sense of someone going out of his way not to say certain things. Those things involved the personalities of the Saudi rulers. Since bin Laden continued to draw on financial resources in the kingdom while living in Afghanistan and was in no physical danger from Saudi hands, he could only be observing a policy of discretion, not expressing fear. Bin Laden was not a major strategist; he was an opportunistic improviser in the style of Hitler or Stalin. Calling for action by the Saudi populace to expel U.S. troops, he advised murdering Americans. But when he summoned Saudi citizens to correct the policies of their government, he never called for killing or other forms of terror against the Saudi rulers. Rather, he praised the drafting of petitions to the king and he recommended that Saudi women boycott American consumer goods. He was aggrieved by the failure of the Saudi Army to serve ably in the Gulf War, but also by the destruction inflicted on Iraq, which he exaggerated. Unlike the Saudi and other Arab governments, he called for lifting the U.N. sanctions on Saddam Husayn. 22 If bin Laden were sincere, he would not accept pay-offs from a cast of characters that not only hold close ties with the most culpable of American “crusaders”, but who are the principal instigators of the Luciferian conspiracy to overthrow Islam. Rather, Adnan Khashoggi, who is among the richest men in the world, and the arms merchant at the center of the entire Iran-Contra operation, has been a life-long friend of the bin Laden family. Adnan Khashoggi’s father was the physician to Mohammed bin Laden, and got his start in business by arranging a large truck import deal for Salem bin Laden. In 1985, bin Mahfouz’s Saudi National Commercial Bank had loaned Khashoggi 35 million dollars to purchase weapons to sell illegally to Iran, at the behest of Oliver North. 23"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 258 The Neo-Nazis Khashoggi had forged an association with Sheik Kamal Adham, the front-man for BCCI, and the CIA, with the incorporation of Barrick Gold, a Canadian company he founded with Peter Munk. Barrick Gold was itself a spin-off of Barrick Resources International (BRI), the nascent firm founded two years before, by Kermit Roosevelt, to serve as a dummy business front for the CIA. The company’s seed investors were Saudis with CIA ties, including Shiek Kamal Adham, Adnan Khashoggi, and Prince Nawaf bin Abdul Aziz, a major investor in Barrick, code-named “Tumbleweed” by his CIA contacts. Khashoggi distanced himself from Barrick shortly after the Iran-Contra scandal broke, but held onto his stock, tied up as collateral for North’s arms transfers to Iran. 24 Prince Turki al-Faisal is also head of Faisal Islamic Bank of Saudi Arabia, which has been named by Luxembourg banking authorities as being directly involved in running accounts for bin Laden. Faisal Bank was founded by Youssef Nada, naturalized Italian, and a member of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood and Gama al Islamiya. Nada was another valued World War II Nazi. As a young man, he had joined the armed branch of the “secret apparatus” of the Muslim Brotherhood, and then was recruited by German military intelligence. When Grand Mufti el-Husseini had to flee Germany in 1945, as the Nazi defeat loomed, Youssef Nada is rumored to have been personally involved in arranging through the SS his escape via Switzerland back to Egypt and then Palestine. 25 Nada served as president of Al Taqwa, an international banking group. Al Taqwa, which literally means “Fear of God,” had been channeling funds to Muslim extremist organizations around the world, including Hamas in Palestine. Serving on the board of Nada Management, a component of Al Taqwa, was Ahmed Huber, a neo-Nazi, and a former journalist who converted to Islam, and changed his first name from Albert. A well-known figure in European neofascist circles, Huber “sees himself as a mediator between Islam and right-wing groups,” according to Germany’s Office for the Protection of the Constitution. 26 Huber is also a member of a group calling itself Avalon, which claims to be based on the “great Celtic tradition”, and at every solstice he meets under the moon, in a forest grove, with a few hundred European Druids, with whom he is preparing the “end of our decline”. With the Thule Society, he works for the restoration of “greater Germany”. 27 Nada was appointed president by Francois Genoud, who is believed to have founded and directed al Taqwa in its support of terrorism, including Bin Laden. 28 Described by the London Observer as “one of the world’s leading Nazis”, Genoud played a key role in the continuation of the Nazi Islamist relationship. 29 He was a former associate of Otto Skorzeny in Algeria, and supposedly helped finance the ODESSA network through his management of the hidden Swiss treasure of the Third Reich, which had been stolen from Jews. Genoud is also"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"Dollars for Terror 259 believed to have masterminded the 1972 hijacking of a Lufthansa flight from Bombay by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PLFP). 30 In addition, Mahfouz’ Saudi Investment Corporation (SICO) is partnered with the Saudi BinLaden Group. SICO was covertly involved in supporting the Mujahideen in Afghanistan during the late 1980’s, in connection with the BCCI-controlled National Bank of Oman. Those responsible for arranging SICO’s financing of Osama bin Laden were the top two InterMaritime Bank executives, Alfred Hartmann of Harken and Bruce Rappaport, in addition to William Casey. 31 The company is chaired by Yeslam bin Laden. Board members are Beatrice Dufour, Baudoin Dunant and Tilouine el Hanafi. Lafour is Yeslam bin Laden’s sister-in-law. She is of Iranian origin and is married to a Swiss financier. Baudoin Dunant, one of French-speaking Switzerland’s leading lawyers, is on the boards of over twenty companies in Geneva, Fribourg, Morges, Nyons, etc. He received international publicity in 1983, when he represented Nazi banker Francois Genoud. 32 Sami Baarma, a top executive of the Saudi National Commercial Bank (NCB), sits on the board of Mahfouz’s Middle East Capital Group (MECG), that had on its board, Sheikh Bakhsh. In addition, Baarma sits on the board of the Carlyle Group, which had former President George H. W. Bush as a senior advisor. Carlyle is the eleventh largest military contractor in the U.S., and a leading contributor to George W. Bush’s 2000 presidential campaign. Former President George H.W. Bush has visited Saudi Arabia at least twice to successfully court bin Laden family financing for the Carlyle Group. The Carlyle Group’s relationships with prominent Saudis is particularly murky considering that, despite assertions that Osama is estranged from the family, the documentary records contradict the claim. According to the Wall Street Journal: Among its far-flung business interests, the well-heeled Saudi Arabian clan - which says it is estranged from Osama - is an investor in a fund established by Carlyle Group, a well-connected Washington merchant bank specializing in buyouts of defense and aerospace companies. Through this investment and its ties to Saudi royalty, the bin Laden family has become acquainted with some of the biggest names in the Republican Party. In recent years, former President Bush, ex-Secretary of State James Baker and ex-Secretary of Defense Frank Carlucci have made the pilgrimage to the bin Laden family’s headquarters in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Mr. Bush makes speeches on behalf of Carlyle Group and is senior adviser to its Asian Partners fund, while Mr. Baker is its senior counselor. Mr. Carlucci is the group’s chairman. Osama is one of more than 50 children of Mohammed bin Laden, who built the family’s $5 billion business, Saudi Binladin Group, largely with construction contracts from the Saudi government... 33 The long-time Chairman of the Carlyle Group, Frank Carlucci, was not only a former Secretary of Defense in the Reagan Administration, but a Deputy"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 260 Director of the CIA during the Carter Administration. As the Second Secretary in the US Embassy in the Congo during the time of the reign and consequent assassination of Patrice Lumumba, Carlucci was intimately involved in the US efforts to overthrow Lumumba’s government. In 1974, Frank Carlucci headed the American CIA operation to overthrow the Lisbon socialist government. He had been Chief of Sears Roebucks international operations, an actual espionage operation, and later a top official of the American intelligence. Blood Diamonds A critical element in the laundering of drug money is the use of gold and diamonds. Hong Kong, the international hub of drug-money laundering, was under the financial control of Israel’s largest finance house, Bank Leumi, which in turn is under control of Barclay’s Bank, on whose board sat Henry Oppenheimer, and the Oppenheimer family. Harry Oppenheimer, the manager of the largest South African gold producer, Anglo-American, is also the presiding manager of the De Beers corporation, originally created by Cecil Rhodes, which runs the worldwide diamond cartel. The diamond cartel sells raw diamonds to 300 secret, select customers, following which the diamonds are sent to either Antwerp or Ashqelon, in Israel, for cutting. The Israeli processing is financed by Bank Leumi, and the Antwerp processing by the Banque Bruxelles-Lambert. The latter bank is controlled by the Lambert family, the Belgian cousins of the Rothschilds. 34 As revealed by Douglas Farah, in Blood From Stones: The Secret Financial Network of Terror, since at least 1998, Al Qaeda operatives were converting their funds by buying and reselling millions of dollars in “blood diamonds” from the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) terror organization in Sierra Leone, headed by Foday Sankoh. The agent in the transactions was the brutal Charles Taylor, the dictator in neighboring Liberia. At the request of the Liberian government, Charles Taylor had been arrested and imprisoned in the U.S. in 1984. And yet, fifteen months later he mysteriously escaped from the Plymouth House of Corrections, and made his way back to Liberia to lead the revolt that toppled Doe. Taylor’s escape, which he has hinted was carried out with the collaboration of the CIA, greatly enhanced his reputation in Liberia as a “big man,” or a person protected by a great foreign power. 35 Douglas Farah asked his source, “CR”, a member of Taylor’s entourage, “Do fighters in the bush really offer human sacrifices and eat the hearts of their victims to gain their strength?” CR didn’t blink an eye. Yes he said, but only a few “really big men”, like Taylor, Foday Sankoh, and their senior commanders carried out the practice because it was such powerful magic. The main organ that gave one spiritual power was the heart. So it was often roasted and eaten. 36"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"Dollars for Terror 261 During the 80s, Taylor and Sankoh passed through the terrorist training camps of the World Revolutionary Headquarters in Lybia, operated by leader Colonel Muammar al Qadhafi. Despite all his revolutionary and anti-Western rhetoric, Qadhafi is a Freemason conspirator. 37 In 1980, when Ronald Reagan became president, the United States government accused the Libyan government of sponsoring international terrorism, and in 1986, ordered major bombing raids against so-called “terrorist sites”, killing approximately sixty people, including Qadhafi’s adopted daughter. However, according to Dr. Stoney Merriman, former Public Affairs Chief of the US Marine Corps at the Pentagon, US Special Forces ground troops had intercepted and protected Colonel Qadhafi in order to prevent his injury during the bombing of his home. The US soldiers were also tasked with protecting any other dignitaries that were visiting Quaddafi. 38 Allegedly, Lybia retaliated in 1988 by bombing Pan Am flight F 103, and putting that corporation into bankruptcy. Though, Pan Am’s own investigation found that U.S. government employees of the CIA had blown up the aircraft, to prevent a U.S. Army “hostage rescue team” on board from blowing the whistle on a Syrian heroin-dealing operation being used by the White House for its illegal Iran-Contra weapons sales. 39 It was in Lybia that Taylor met Ibrahim Bah, whom the FBI identify as the RUF’s main diamond dealer with Al Qaeda. Also known by a host of aliases, Senegalese born Bah speaks fluent French, Arabic, and English, as well as several local dialects. By the late 80s, he had already fought in a Senegalese revolt, studied Muslim theology in Egypt, trained in special warfare in Libya for four years, and served with the Mujahideen in Afghanistan. After returning to Lybia, he joined the Hezbollah in southern Lebanon and fought against Israel. Returning to Lybia, he served as Quaddafi bodyguard and trainer. In 1998 Al Qaeda’s Abdullah Ahmed Abdullah went to Liberia to set up the arrangement with Bah and the RUF, for Al Qaeda to buy the illegal Sierra Leone diamonds on a regular basis. The Bah network goes directly to Antwerp Belgium, the world’s largest diamond center. Bah arranged for al Qaeda operatives to buy all diamonds possible from the RUF, the Charles Taylor-supported rebel army that controlled much of neighboring civil-war- torn Sierra Leone. “The rebels used the cash from al Qaeda to buy the weapons. The stones gave al Qaeda a fail-safe way to hide its assets outside banks and other financial institutions,” writes Farah. “Belgian investigators later traced $20 million through a single account they believe was used by al Qaeda to purchase diamonds.” 40 The CIA has been reluctant to corroborate any evidence of a link because it reflects badly on them. The US had used Liberia as a main CIA base throughout the Cold War. Taylor himself was a CIA informant for years, and the U.S. backed his anti-Doe activities in the eighties and then his bid for power in the nineties. 41 This fact, and Liberia acting as a haven for Al"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 262 Qaeda operatives, like Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani, now being held in connection with the 1998 bombings of two US embassies in Africa, would explain why the United States waited so long to support Taylor’s ouster, and continues to refrain from using its influence to bring him before a UN war crimes tribunal. Taylor, who was deposed last year, is living in exile in Nigeria under a deal brokered by the United States. As recently as June 2003, the FBI reported to the US General Accounting Office that there was no al Qaeda presence in West Africa, despite what intelligence and military officials said was a plan to capture Ghailani, in the weeks after the September 11 attacks, using a U.S. special forces team stationed in nearby Guinea. However, that mission was called off, although it is unclear exactly why. 42 In the mean time, leaders of al Qaeda continued to receive Taylor’s protection. “For some reason our intelligence people have been very anxious to disprove this as happening, something that can’t be disproven,” said Joseph Melrose, who was US ambassador to Sierra Leone until September 2001. 43 Farah called Taylor’s Liberia “a Disneyland for criminals,” where Israeli organized crime figures supplied weapons to Hezbollah arms dealers, ex-Soviet planes could deliver merchandise anywhere in the world, and everyone would be protected by Liberia’s status as a sovereign nation. “The entire diamond operation”, notes Paul Rasche, “depends on the complicity of Israeli diamond interests and of the Israeli intelligence and mafia organizations, which dominate world diamond trade.” 44 The key figure in the entire operation interfacing Al Qaeda, Sierra Leone’s RUF and Taylor’s Libya, is retired Israeli army Lt. Colonel, Yair Klein. According to a report in the Israeli newspaper, Yedioth Aharonoth, in 1996, Klein began a contract to provide weapons and training in Taylor’s Liberia, and to the RUF in Sierra Leone which controls the wealthy diamond district. Klein, though ostensibly a retired and so-called rogue intelligence free agent, enjoys the highest-level of protection from Israeli authorities. In the early 90s, he trained the forces of the Colombian drug cartels in assassination, bombings and other covert operations. 45 Involved in the Liberian diamond trade was Victor Bout, a notorious Russian arms dealer originally from Tajikistan. Bout supplied maintenance for Ariana Airways, Afghanistan’s national airline, which was essentially taken over by al Qaeda, and began transportation for their illegal trade network. Passenger flights became few and erratic, and instead the airline began flying drugs, weapons, gold and personnel mostly between Afghanistan, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Pakistan. Finally, Ariana’s international flights were banned in 1999 by order of the UN. The charter service, which operated with UN authorization from November 2000 through January 2001, was provided by the Flying Dolphin Airline, owned by Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed bin Saqr al Nayhan, a member of the ruling family in Abu Dhabi, who used to"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"Dollars for Terror 263 be the UAE ambassador to the United States. Flying Dolphin was registered in Liberia, but had its operations in Dubai. A UN report called Zayed a “close business associate of Bout.” 46 In 2002, the Belgian government, through Interpol, issued a warrant for Bout, on charges of illegal weapons trafficking. Though Interpol was told by the Russian government, “we can say for sure Bout is not in Russia,” Bout was in the middle of taping a two-hour interview for a Moscow radio station. Obstacles in arresting him persisted, until the US suddenly backed off the case. Intelligence officials said Bout flew US clandestine operatives into Afghanistan, as well as badly needed ammunition and other supplies to the Northern Alliance. In exchange, they said, his past activities would be ignored. 47"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 264"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"265 Rothschilds and the Holy Grail Jacob Rothschild, the current head of the Rothschild dynasty, has intermarried with the Sinclair family, forging an important dynastic alliance between the head family of the Illuminati, and the supposed “Grail family”. This marriage is significant, as it is an exception in the marriage practices of the Rothschilds. The founder of the dynasty, Mayer Amschel Rothschild, had ordered his sons to marry only their first cousins. The first exception was Hannah, daughter of Nathan Rothschild, who married the Rt. Hon. Henry Fitzroy, a direct descendant of Charles II Stuart King of England. However, more recently, the great-great-great grandson of Nathan Mayer, Nathaniel Charles Jacob Rothschild, Fourth Baron Rothschild, current head of the dynasty, married Mary Serena Dunn, whose mother was Lady Mary Sybil St. Clair-Erksine, the daughter of James Francis Harry St. Clair-Erskine, 5th Earl of Rosslyn. The title of Earl of Rosslyn was created in 1801 for Alexander Wedderburn, 1st Baron Loughborough, the former Lord Chancellor. The earldom was created with special remainder to his nephew, Sir James St Clair-Erskine, who was Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Scotland, on behalf of King George IV. The Erskine family were the hereditary Earls of Mar. They are descended from Robert I Erksine, who married Elizabeth Stewart, the daughter of Robert II of Scotland, the son of Robert the Bruce’s daughter Marjorie and Robert Stewart. John 5 th of Erskine was guardian of King James V, and afterwards of Mary, Queen of Scots. James V had an illegitimate child through his daughter, Margaret, named James Stewart, step-brother to Mary Queen of Scots. In 1565, Queen Mary made Margaret’s brother, John 7 th Earl of Mar. Jacob Rothschild is the current head of the UK Rothschild family, having inherited the fourth baronetcy from his father, Victor, an eminent zoologist, and sometime MI5 agent and friend of KGB agents Anthony Blunt and Guy Burgess. Jacob resigned from the family’s bank NM Rothschilds in 1980, run by his cousin Evelyn, and started RIT Capital Partners.

Jacob was a close personal friend of Princess Diana, and maintains strong personal and business links with Henry Kissinger. His country estate has been a regular venue for visiting heads of state including Presidents Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton. Margaret Thatcher received French President François Mitterrand there at a summit in 1990. He hosted the European Economic Round Table conference in 2002, attended by such figures as James Wolfensohn, president of the World Bank, Nicky Oppenheimer, Warren Buffet and Arnold Schwarzenegger. He knows Rupert Murdoch well, having been friends since the Australian newspaper magnate first came to the UK in the 60s. The Neo-Conservatives Rupert Murdoch, head of the notorious Fox network, has become one of the principal mouthpieces for the new Neo-Conservative agenda, currently orchestrating the so-called “Clash of Civilization”. The main intellectual influence on the neoconservatives was Leo Strauss, who, according to Barry Chamish, is today to leading proponent of the Frankist agenda. 1 Strauss, a student of Heidegger, arrived in the US in 1937 as a refugee from Nazi Germany, and taught at the Rockefeller funded University of Chicago. Strauss was brought to the university by its Chancellor, Robert Maynard Hutchins, one of the original sponsors of the Aspen Institute, an Aquarian conspirator, and a member of the CFR. Strauss argued that the works of ancient philosophers contain deliberately concealed esoteric meanings. Strauss, like Plato, taught that within societies, some are fit to lead, while others only to be led. But for Strauss, it was Machiavelli who initiated the Enlightenment, by rejecting the purely theoretical world of Plato, in favor of a more practical interpretation of reality, thus creating political science. For Strauss, in accordance with Machiavellian thinking, virtue would not be applicable, because no regime could meet its standards. Rather, a new regime should be created, by accepting, understanding, and harnessing man’s tendency for self-interest, or “human nature”. Strauss thought that those who are fit to rule are they who realize there is no morality. Strauss believed the world to be a place where policy advisers may have to deceive their own publics, and even their rulers in order to protect their countries. If exposed to the absence of absolute truth, the masses would quickly succumb to nihilism or anarchy. They “can’t handle the truth”. Thus, according to Strauss, it is necessary to maintain these “pious frauds”, or “the Noble Lie”, as Plato would have referred to it. Finally, like Thomas Hobbes, Strauss believed that the inherently aggressive nature of human beings could only be restrained by a powerful"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"Total War 267 nationalistic state. In other words, Fascism. “Because mankind is intrinsically wicked, he has to be governed,” he wrote. “Such governance can only be established, however, when men are united – and they can only be united against other people.” 2 According to Shadia Drury, in Leo Strauss and the American Right, “Strauss thinks that a political order can be stable only if it is united by an external threat.” Ultimately, as Drury clarifies, “following Machiavelli, he maintained that if no external threat exists then one has to be manufactured.” 3 Thus, in September 2000, the Project for the New American Century (PNAC), a neo-conservative think-tank, with strong ties to the right-wing American Enterprise Institute, and funded by three foundations closely tied to Persian Gulf oil and weapons and defense industries, drafted a plan for U.S. global domination. AEI is also connected to the Heritage Foundation, through the same funders. The project’s participants included individuals who would play leading roles in the second Bush administration: Vice President Cheney, of the CFR and a Trilateralist, secretary of defense Rumsfeld, a Bilderberger, and his deputy Wolfowitz, also a Bildeberger. Several of PNAC members, including Cheney, Khalilzad and the Bush family, all have ties to the oil industry. These PNAC signatories represent a core group of Neo-conservatives, who are believed to now actually dictate the policies of the Bush administration. They are called “neo-conservatives” because many of them started off as anti- Stalinist leftists or liberals, before moving to the far right. Others include Elliott Abrams, National Security Council staffer; Douglas Feith, of the Pentagon; Lewis “Scooter” Libby, Cheney’s chief of staff; and John R. Bolton, of the State Department. Outside the administration, are James Woolsey, former CIA director, and Richard Perle, nicknamed the “Prince of Darkness”. The nation of Israel is a major concern to these neo-conservatives, and many of them has continuing ties to it. As political scientist Benjamin Ginsberg puts it: One major factor that drew them inexorably to the right was their attachment to Israel and their growing frustration during the 1960s with a Democratic party that was becoming increasingly opposed to American military preparedness and increasingly enamored of Third World causes [e.g., Palestinian rights]. In the Reaganite right’s hard-line anti-communism, commitment to American military strength, and willingness to intervene politically and militarily in the affairs of other nations to promote democratic values (and American interests), neocons found a political movement that would guarantee Israel’s security. 4 Titled, Rebuilding America’s Defenses: Strategy, Forces and Resources for a New Century, the PNAC report envisioned an expanded global military role for the U.S., by stipulating, “The United States has for decades sought to play a more permanent role in Gulf regional security. While the unresolved conflict with Iraq provides the immediate justification, the need for a substantial American force presence in the Gulf transcends the issue of the"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 268 regime of Saddam Hussein.” However, it added, “even should Saddam pass from the scene,” the plan states, U.S. military bases in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait will remain, despite domestic opposition in the Gulf states to the permanent stationing of U.S. troops. Iran, it says, “may well prove as large a threat to U.S. interests as Iraq has.” A “core mission” for the U.S. military, according to the PNAC, is to “fight and decisively win multiple, simultaneous major theater wars”. The “transformation” of the U.S. military into an imperialistic force of global domination would require a massive increase in defense spending, to “a minimum level of 3.5 to 3.8 percent of gross domestic product, adding $15 billion to $20 billion to total defense spending annually,” the PNAC plan said. “The process of transformation,” the plan further clarifies, “is likely to be a long one, absent some catastrophic and catalyzing event — like a new Pearl Harbor.” 5 September 11 September 11 offered the opportunity to finally embark upon the ultimate plan devised by Albert Pike, and articulated more recently by Samuel Huntington as a Clash of Civilization, a global war against Islam. As William Engdahl pointed out, “if the Bush administration had been unprepared for the shock of September 11, 2001, they certainly wasted no time in preparing their response, the war on terror. Terror was to replace communism as the new global image of “the enemy”. 6 On September 18, 2001, Niaz Niak, former Pakistani foreign secretary, told the BBC he had been informed by senior US officials at a mid-July Berlin meeting that “military action against Afghanistan would go ahead by the middle of October.” 7 Ultimately, the invasion of Afghanistan was a furtherance of the initial plans devised by Brzezinski to gain control over Central Asia. As experts have consistently pointed out, there is little credibility to the mythology that al Qaeda acted alone. When asked if he thought Osama bin Laden was responsible for the attacks, Milton Beardman rebuffed the possibility, noting that, on his evaluation of the scale of the attacks, blame should not be automatically attributed to bin Laden. Instead, he added that it was more likely that a far more “sophisticated” intelligence operation was responsible. 8 Former CIA official Robert Baer, who was Case Officer in the Directorate of Operations for the agency from 1976 to 1997, and who received the Career Intelligence Medal, observed that, “did bin Laden act alone, through his own al-Qaeda network, in launching the attacks? About that I’m far more certain and emphatic: no.” 9 Stan Goff, a retired US Army Special Forces Master Sergeant, also remarked:"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"Total War 269 This cartoon heavy they’ve turned bin Laden into makes no sense, when you begin to appreciate the complexity and synchronicity of the attacks. As a former military person who’s been involved in the development of countless operations orders over the years, I can tell you that this was a very sophisticated and costly enterprise that would have left what we call a huge “signature.” In other words, it would be very hard to effectively conceal. 10 Military-strategic analyst and retired Major General Dr. Mahmoud Khalaf, Fellow at Egypt’s Higher Military Academy, Member of the Royal College of Defence Studies in London, Honorary Member of the Association of the United States Army in Fort Benning, in a presentation at the Center for Asian Studies in the University of Cairo, related: First we are confronted with a technical operation of extremely great dimensions. We estimate that the planning organ for this operation must have consisted of at least 100 specialized technicians, who needed one year of planning... The high level of the operation does not match the level of evidence presented... Now, the puzzling question is the preparation and training of these people who had the capability to follow up and execute... There is, actually, one question, which is posed here. That is that there is no proportionality between the performance of the operation and the performance of bin Laden and his followers. 11 Rather, there are numerous instances of evidence that point to complicity in the attacks at the highest levels. Sibel Edmonds, an FBI translator, says the agency covered up evidence warning of the 9-11 attack. She tried to blow the whistle on the cover-up of intelligence that names some of the culprits who orchestrated the 9/11 attacks, but she is now under two gag orders that forbid her from testifying in court or mentioning the names of the people or the countries involved. She has nevertheless been quoted saying: “My translations of the 9/11 intercepts included [terrorist] money laundering, detailed and date- specific information ... if they were to do real investigations, we would see several significant high-level criminal prosecutions in this country [the US] ... and believe me, they will do everything to cover this up”. 12 The several examples of suspicious activity begin with Arab specialist Antoine Sfeir, according to whom“the CIA maintained contacts with bin Laden until 1998. Those contacts didn’t end after bin Laden moved to Afghanistan.” 13 The last time bin Laden met with the CIA was in July of 2001. As reported by the French daily Le Figaro, Osama Bin Laden was to undergo treatment at the American Hospital in Dubai, where he met a CIA official. Radio France International (RFI) corroborated the report, based on authoritative French intelligence sources, as well as “a witness, a professional partner of the administrative management of the hospital.” 14 Though bin Laden has denied the incident, maintaining it was one of his sons who had been mistaken for him, the doctor who treated him has since"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 270 refused to respond to questioning. While he was hospitalized, bin Laden also received visits from many members of his family, as well as prominent Saudis and Emiratis. The newspaper recorded: According to Arab diplomatic sources as well as French intelligence, very specific information was transmitted to the CIA with respect to terrorist attacks against American interests around the world, including on US soil. A DST [French intelligence] report dated 7 September enumerates all the intelligence, and specifies that the order to attack was to come from Afghanistan. 15 And, days before September 11, a delegation headed by Lt. Gen. Mahmoud Ahmed, Director-General of the Pakistani ISI, was in Washington, for top-level meetings in the White House, the Pentagon, the NSC, and with George Tenet, then head of the CIA, and Marc Grossman, the under-secretary of state for political affairs. The day before the attacks, the Pakistani Daily News, recognizing that talks must have centered around Afghanistan and Osama bin Laden, had noticed that the last time such visits had taken place domestic politics turned “topsy-turvy”, and foresaw, “that this is not the first visit by Mahmoud in the last three months shows the urgency of the ongoing parleys.” 16 However, just before the commencement of the bombing campaign against Afghanistan, Mahmoud was dismissed from his position, at U.S. instigation. It had been discovered that, at his bidding, $100,000 had been wired to Mohammed Atta, the supposed ring-leader of the 9/11 attacks. The transfer was made through Ahmad Omar Sheikh, who was one of the three militants released in exchange for passengers of the hijacked Indian Airlines plane in 1999. 17 As to what such a connection implies, in an article for the Guardian, Michael Meacher pointed out that, “the case of Ahmed confirms that parts of the ISI directly supported and financed al-Qaeda, and it has long been established that the ISI has acted as go- between in intelligence operations on behalf of the CIA.” 18 Omar Sheikh is now waiting to be hanged in Pakistan for the murder of Daniel Pearl in 2002, which he did not commit. Both the US government and Pearl’s wife have since acknowledged that he was not responsible, but the Pakistani government refuses to try other suspects newly implicated in case because it could reveal too much. Rather, the New York Times has since reported that “American officials said that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, once al-Qaida’s top operational commander [and the architect of 9/11], personally executed Daniel Pearl ... but he was unlikely to be accused of the crime in an American criminal court because of the risk of divulging classified information”. 19 In 1993, according to court affidavits, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was quizzed by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) after an agent of al Qaeda was caught entering the US with his driver’s license and a false passport. However, the Mounties released Mohammed when the FBI claimed him as a prized asset, and the former US Army sergeant was free to continue running with al-Qaeda.

The FBI informant was only picked up in late 1998 and sentenced for his part in the crime. 20 Terrorist Flight Training and MK-Ultra Aside from the various theories that claim some sort of foul play in the 9/11 incident, it is investigative reporter Daniel Hopsicker who discovered a hornet’s nest of intrigue in and around a flight school in Venice Florida, where the terrorists Mohammed Atta and Marwan al-Shehhi, were trained to fly. Hopsicker’s research reveals a circle of evidence which is otherwise ignored by the authorities, but which nevertheless offers up the most incriminating trail of information. According to Newsweek, the Washington Post and the New York Times, U.S. military officials gave the FBI information “suggesting that five of the alleged hijackers received training in the 1990s at secure U.S. military installations.” 21 Hijackers may have been trained in strategy and tactics at the Air War College in Montgomery Alabama. Two were former Saudi Air Force pilots. Mohammed Atta, their supposed ringleader, attended International Officers School at Maxwell Air Force Base in Montgomery, while Abdulaziz Alomari attended Aerospace Medical School at Brooks Air Force base in Texas, and Saeed Alghambi the Defense Language Institute in Monterey California. Daniel Hopsicker, in Welcome to Terrorland: Mohamed Atta & the 9- 11 Cover-up in Florida, reveals that least eight of the terrorist pilots received their initial training in Venice, Florida, at either of the flight schools owned by Arne Kruithof and Rudi Dekkers. Dekkers, the owner of Huffman Aviation, had reportedly been indicted in his native Holland, on charges that included fraud and money laundering. Dekkers purchased the flight school at just about the time the terrorist pilots moved into town and began their lessons. Atta and al-Shehhi paid $28,000 each to Rudi Dekkers, for flight instruction that was available nearby for a fraction of the price. Yeslam bin Laden also provided several students for training at Huffman, though he still claims to be estranged from his step-brother. 22 More might have been known about Dekkers’ dubious history, but following 9/11, the FBI removed the files at Huffman, and loaded them onto a C-130 military cargo plane at the Sarasota airport, which took off for Washington with governor Jeb Bush on board. 23 Wally Hilliard, Dekkers’ financier, a supposedly retired, born-again insurance executive from the midwest, entered the aviation business in Florida with an assortment of criminal and covert intelligence elements. Less than three months before the two terrorists began flight training, a Lear jet owned by Hilliard, carrying 43 pounds of heroin, was seized by the DEA. Charges were dropped for “lack of evidence”, but the DEA refused to return Hilliard his plane. Hilliard had gotten his Lear jet from World Jet Inc, owned by drug smuggling brothers Don and Bill Whittington, who had supplied Barry Seal his plane. 24 "},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 272 The Justice Department declined to prosecute the pilot, Diego Levine- Texar, even though the DEA agent in charge revealed he had guilty knowledge and should have been charged. Diego’s other job had been to fly for Venezuela’s Air Force One. The co-pilot, it turns out, on Diegos’ heroin runs, unnamed in the court documents, was a DEA agent. 25 Hilliard was then loaned a plane, a Beechcraft King Air 200, worth over $2 million, by Truman Arnold, for only one dollar. Arnold, the chief fund-raiser for the Democratic Party in 1995, when the Whitewater scandal broke, was investigated for dubious money-raising schemes, from renting out the White House’s Lincoln Bedroom, to selling tickets on Air Force One. Arnold, who played golf with Clinton, had also been responsible for coordinated payments to convicted Clinton friend Web Hubbell, of the Mena cocaine ring. 26 Arnold was defended during the Whitewater Investigation by slick Washington lawyer Richard Ben-Veniste, who had also not only served on the Watergate and then Whitewater panels, and defended Barry Seal, but was recently serving on the official 9/11 probe. 27 The plane was conveyed from Arnold to a Hilliard company, Oryx, founded by Sheik Kamal Adham, former director of Saudi intelligence, and BCCI front-man, and Adnan Khashoggi. 28 A colleague of Khashoggi, Amr Ibrahim “Anthony” Elgindy, according to Kenneth Breen, an assistant federal attorney, notified his Salomon Smith Barney broker to sell off stocks, predicting that a stock market crash was imminent and the index would fall to 3000, which it did. Breen, suggested to the judge, “perhaps Mr. Elgindy had foreknowledge of Sept. 11, and rather than report it he attempted to profit from it.” 29 Elgindy was charged of being the leader of a criminal racketeering enterprise alleged to have been short-selling and illegally manipulating stock in companies that were under criminal investigation. The information about these companies was provided to Elgindy, allegedly, by FBI agents that were members of his criminal enterprise. Among the other counts against Elgindy, he is accused of extorting shares from companies that he learned, via the information these FBI agents provided him, were under criminal investigation. 30 Elgindy’s brother, Khaled, was linked to the Iran-Contra scandal, through his ties with Elliot Abrams, who had been Reagan’s Assistant Secretary of State. Abram’s is also a Bush-pardoned Iran-Contra war criminal. Now, via his new role in the NSC, he will now be working on Arab-Israeli peace initiatives. Abram’s new official title is Special Assistant to the President and Senior Director for Near East and North African Affairs. Abrams chaired the US Commission on International Religious Freedom, and sitting on the Washington DC Human Rights Committee chaired by him, was Khaled Elgindy, where he served as a policy analyst. Anthony and Khaled’s father, Ibrahim Elgindy, was reported to have founded an umbrella group of Muslim organizations in Chicago, and led a 1998 protest on behalf of Muhammad Salah, a man the US government calls a designated global"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"Total War 273 terrorist. Salah confessed to Israeli authorities that he was raising money for Hamas’ suicide bombings and training cells in the US to make explosives. 31 One of the companies Elgindy targeted and traded was GenesisIntermedia, or GENI. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil suit in 2003 against individuals in scams involving GenisisIntermedia, which included Iran-Contra arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi, but also stock-fraud artist Rafi Khan, the Toronto branch of Deustche Bank Securities, the Vancouver Stock Exchange (VSE), and Thomas Brooks, a broker, who can’t seem to account for shares loaned from Native Nations Securities. Other than Adnan Khashoggi, ties between Iran-Contra conspirators and GENI included its director, Michael Roy Fugler, who was an integral part of Barry Seal’s organization. Apparently, it was Fugler’s job to set-up the front companies for Seal’s drug proceeds. 32 The Securities and Exchange Commission is claiming that the clearing firm of MJK was defrauded when millions of dollars outstanding on Native Nations Securities’ borrowed GENI shares could not be collected. Native Nations Securities, a New Jersey firm, was run by Valerie Red-Horse, office manager for junk-bond king Michael Milken of Drexel, Burnham, Lambert, a junk-bond securities company with Mafia associates, and high-ranking political connections in New York State. Drexel, Burnham, Lambert is connected to the Drexel Company, itself, according to FBI investigator Richard Taus, part of the K-Team which was involved in the Iran-Contra operation. 33 Investigations carried out by FBI Special Agent Richard Taus discovered covert CIA operations which included the looting of Savings and Loans, and drug-trafficking with the American faction of the Mafia. Agent Taus says he discovered that Oliver North, the White House, and the National Security Council, were all involved. Taus mentioned a white-collar upper-echelon faction of the American Mafia, called the “K-Team”. The K-Team had a front operation with the patriotic sounding name National Freedom Institute, and called its operation the “Enterprise”, the same that repeatedly surfaced in the hearings of the Iran-Contra affair. 34 Taus was warned by his supervisors that he would be “seriously hurt” if he continued investigating the K-Team, a group involving operatives of the Iran-contra affair. When he refused, he was finally arrested on trumped up charges in 1988. Taus described government drug routes and suppliers in the Middle East, by way of Turkey, Bulgaria and Lebanon. Taus also spoke of competition between the American and Sicilian factions of the Mafia, which he explained as the reason behind personnel at the Justice Department moving towards eliminating the Sicilian Mafia. According to Taus, the K-Team was based in Freeport, Long Island and it partially consisted of several operators that were associated with a CIA banking front, Drexel Company, which later changed its name to Castle Securities. Taus described how his investigation into their activities took him to Florida and looking into certain flight and aviation"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 274 fronts, like Southern Air Transport, which was employed by the CIA in the Iran-Contra operation. 35 Britannia Aviation, which operated from a hangar at Huffman Aviation at the Venice Airport, had a “green light” from the Justice Department’s Drugs Enforcement Administration (DEA), and the Venice Police Department “had been warned to leave them alone.” 36 Britannia was contracted to operate a large maintenance facility at the Lynchburg, Virginia, Regional Airport, though virtually nothing was known of the company. Britannia was chosen over a successful multi-million dollar Lynchburg company with more that forty employees, though Britannia was worth less than $750. It was also found that Britannia had been providing maintenance services for Caribe Air, a Caribbean company, and notorious CIA proprietary carrier, with a checkered past. Caribe Air aircraft had been seized a decade before by federal officials, at the infamous Mena airbase in Arkansas, after having been accused by the government of using as many as twenty planes to ship drugs valued in the billions of dollars into the U.S. 37 Britannia’s move from Venice to Lynchburg, VA, was eased because Hilliard had loaned Jerry Falwell a million dollars, which the televangelist showed no indication of intending to repay. Falwell needed the money because he was being foreclosed upon by Jackson Stephens. Many flight trainers who trained the Arab terrorists also moonlighted by flying “Christian missionary” flights to Central and South America, out of the Venice and Sarasota Airports, for Falwell crony, Pat Robertson’s Operation Blessing. 38 Hilliard and Dekkers were partners with Rick Boehlke in the creation of a new airline, Florida Air, or Flair. Boehlke was also then a participant in Portland, OR., in the $340 million looting of pension funds of mostly Mafia run unions, like the Laborers Union. Boehlke was assisted by his friend Jeff Grayson, head of the firm Capital Consultants LLC, who invested $6 million with Title Loans of America, a legalized loan-sharking firm in Georgia, owned by Alvin Malnik, known as “Meyer Lansky’s heir”. Alvin Malnik, a Jewish lawyer from Miami, has extremely close ties to Prince Turki al Faisal. Malnik’s son, Mark, converted to Islam, changed his name to Shareef, and then married the daughter of Sheikh al Fazzi, whose other daughter is married to Prince Turki. 39 Boehlke owned one of the largest holdings of freestanding retirement homes, one of which was on the opposite side of the street, and a block away from Huffman Aviation, of an opulent three-story red-brick building belonging to the empire of Jackson Stephens. The building houses Stephens’ former law firm, Boone Boone & Boone, which some credit with running the town of Venice. One local journalist explained, “I don’t think you could safely say that they run everything in town. But you could safely say they run almost everything. They exert a strong influence here, including out at the airport.” 40 Hilliard’s business partner in a number of airplanes was Mark Shubin, a Russian with experience in the Jamaican military, and links with the CIA and"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"Total War 275 the KBG, and the Russian Mob. The offices of his company, Sky Bus Inc. were located in the same hangar as the Whittington Brother’s company, World Jet. Mark Shubin was in business with the notorious Ken Wood, who played a large part in the Silverado Saving and Loan collapse. He was in business with Neil Bush, brother to the current president. Peter Brewton, of the Houston Post, who broke the CIA-Mafia connection to the S&L Scandal, said that Neil Bush’s Silverado partners “all had connections to individuals or S&L connected to [New Orleans “Mafia Kingfish”] Beebe, allegedly connected to the underworld.” 42 Hilliard owns an FBO, or “full service fixed based operator”, in Nassau called Executive Jet Support with a guy named Alfonso Bowe, whose sister is married to the Prime Minister of the Bahamas. He also runs a flight school with Pervez Khan, who bought the Air Florida Certificate. Khan apparently has a contract with the U.S. Treasury Foreign Assets Control to fly directly to Havana, Cuba, by special permission, though foreign nationals aren’t allowed to own U.S. air carriers, or supposed to be flying to Havana. 42 Wally Hilliard also did business with Myron Du Bain, who had worked alongside late ex-CIA director John McCone, on the boards of several banks. Du Bain was on the board of United California Bank (UCB), right after former CIA director John McCone had served as chairman. The UCB had been on the brink of collapse, “under the weight of highly irregular loans.” Essentially, UCB had been known as John McCone’s “piggy bank”, and with Myron Du Bain on board, they had “attempted to recover monies looted and missing” by Saudi arms dealers, such as Adnan Khashoggi and former CIA personnel. 43 Boarding a plane from Lexington was Prince Ahmed bin Salman, a nephew of King Fahd. Ahmed’s father, Prince Salman bin Abdul Aziz, was the governor of Riyadh and member of the Sudairi clan, who had worked closely with Osama bin Laden during the Afghanistan war. Ahmed was better known as the owner of many top racehorses, like Point Given, the 2001 Horse of the Year, which won two legs of the Triple Crown. Related is the incident when Abu Zubayda, the chief of operations for al Qaeda, was captured in Pakistan. The CIA attempted to intimidate him into confessing by sending a team of Arab Americans posing as Saudi security agents, because of their reputation for brutality. The opposite was the effect. Instead, Zubaydah was relieved, and provided the agents the contact information for Prince Ahmed bin Salman, explaining, “he will tell you what to do.” He said that, several years, earlier the royal family had settled a deal with al Qaeda, by which the Saudis would help the Taliban, if al Qaeda would refrain from attacking Saudi Arabia. Therefore, Zubayda added, he dealt with Prince Ahmed. The CIA asked Saudi intelligence of the truth of Zubayda’s allegations, but they rebuffed the possibility. Nevertheless, Prince Ahmed eventually turned up dead. News reports said the forty-two year old had died of a heart attack in his sleep. Ahmed was not the only person named by Zubayda to suffer consequences. The next day, Ahmed’s cousin, Prince Sultan bin Faisal bin Turki"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 276 al Saud, was killed in a one-car crash, while en route to Ahmed’s funeral. Then, a week later, Prince Fahd bin Turki bin Saud al Kabir, the third to be named by Zubaydah, was found in the desert, having apparently died of thirst. 44 When Osama Basnan, a Saudi living in Washington, pleaded for assistance from the Saudi embassy in California, because his wife was suffering from a thyroid condition, Bandar and his wife Haifa, the sister of Prince Turki al Faisal, contributed a total of $130,000 to the couple over a four-year period. Basnan, however, handed the money over to another Saudi, who in turn subsidized two men who helped hijack the airplane that crashed into the Pentagon. There is no evidence, though, that Bandar or his wife knew how their money was used, and both have denied allegations they knowingly financed terrorists. John Villada stated, “I was Wally’s jet manager. My office was next to his. I could overhear everything he said. I still don’t know who he is.” Nobody knows for sure who Wally works for,” said Mark Shubin. “I know more about Wally Hilliard than I ever want to know,” said a former Huffman Aviation Executive. Referring to the U.S. military deliberately leaving an escape route open to Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan, he further noted, “why do you think the U.S. military didn’t close the passes into Pakistan during the Tora Bora bombing? This all goes far deeper than you think.” Like many other witnesses in Venice, he demanded anonymity. He explained, “I’ve got a family”. 45 Though Dekkers denied there was such a relationship, according to Venice cab driver Bob Simpson, Dekkers and Mohammed Atta, “knew each other well, really well. They were friends.” 46 Most of Atta’s closest associates in Venice were not Arabs, but Europeans with connections to the drug trade. Amanda Keller, Atta’s girlfriend in Venice, claimed that all of his friends, with the exception of al Shehhi, were German and Dutch, including Dekkers and Kruithof. Atta called certain Arabic people “my brother”, but he also called his German friends, Wolfgang and Juergen, “my brother” as well. 47 As discovered by Daniel Hopsicker, Atta lived two months with Amanda Keller, an American stripper and lingerie model. He apparently loved the nightlife, to drink, and snorted cocaine. Atta’s email list also included names of people who worked for defense contractors, like one who, for instance, worked for a Canadian firm, Virtual Prototypes, which helped develop the avionics for F-15, F-22 and B-2. Under pressure from the FBI, Keller publicly retracted her story though. Similarly, according to two employees of a bar in Ft. Lauderdale, Atta and two companions had gotten “wasted”, and Atta blurted “F*ck God!” However, these witnesses too mysteriously retracted their statements. 48 The only way to explain why Mohammed Atta would have hurled himself into a building, because it was certainly not for Islam, was that he was an Illuminati mind-control subject. He certainly depicted the psychopathic behavior typical of such a condition. After Amanda Keller threw him out of their apartment, revenged himself by disemboweling her pet cat and dismembering its half-dozen baby kittens, then strewing the pieces around her"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"Total War 277 apartment to be discovered when she returned home from work. 49 An eyewitness from a bar, where Atta had embarked on a drinking binge, explained that, “he was just kind of strange, because he was just staring. Everytime I’d walk in and out, he had the same look on his face, so God knows what was going through his mind.” 50 Daniel Hopsicker, in Welcome to Terrorland, also reports he “heard speculation, from people who had been in his presence in Venice, that he looked as if he might have been brainwashed, not that anyone in town had ever seen anyone who had been brainwashed, but he looked the way they thought somebody in that condition might look.” 51 For four of the years Atta lived in Hamburg, he was a “scholarship” student at an elite international exchange program, part of a “joint venture” between the U.S. and German governments, run by an organization with ties to figures, like David Rockefeller and Henry Kissinger. The U.S. end of the program is run out of an address at the U.N. Plaza in New York, by CDS International, named after Carl Duisberg, who headed the Bayer Corporation, and founded I.G. Farben. 52 During WW I, Duisberg devised the slave labour system later perfected by IG Farben, which financed the infamous Joseph Mengele, who later developed the MK-Ultra and Monarch mind control programs. 53 Captain John McCarthy, US Army Special Forces (Ret.), who ran CIA assassination teams out of Saigon during the Vietnam War, told his friend, LAPD whistleblower Mike Ruppert, that “MK-Ultra is a CIA acronym that officially stands for “Manufacturing Killers Utilizing Lethal Tradecraft Requiring Assassinations.” 54 Henry Kissinger nevertheless lauded the program at a dinner celebration of the CDS International in 1987, congratulating it for its 20 years of service in keeping close business ties, not only between Germany and the U.S., but more also through career development programs for participants from “other countries”. During his visit to Germany, to commemorate the Berlin Airlift, Clinton noted the U.S. “will be working hard to expand our support” for the CDS program, which “has already given more than 10,000 German and American students the chance to visit each other’s countries.” 55 Mohammed Atta was likely a believer, though he was clearly mentally unbalanced. More likely than the possibility that he was programmed to carry out the destruction of 9/11, is the likelihood that he was merely a patsy. According to CIA hypnosis expert Milton Klein, creating such a candidate is easier than programming a Manchurian Candidate. The patsy can be induced by hypnosis to do things which later show up as circumstantial evidence that will get him falsely blamed for a crime. Klein has claimed he can create a patsy in three months; a Manchurian Candidate takes six months. 56"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 278 The Wahhabi Lobby Although the Saudi government is primarily responsible for the financing of terrorism, the cooperation at high levels of the Republican government in propagating its Wahhabi version of Islam in the U.S reveals the depth of the conspiracy. On September 26, 2001, George W. Bush gathered fifteen prominent Muslim and Arab-Americans at the White House, where he proclaimed that, “the teachings of Islam are teachings of peace and good.” This assemblage of Muslim “moderates” was a necessary diplomatic maneuver to deny that the Bush administration was at war with Islam. However, many of the leaders present were part of a large network of Islamic organizations, created through Saudi funding for the spread of Wahhabi Islam, and often with ties to terrorist activities. Since 1975, the Saudis have spent as much as seventy billion dollars towards this international project, making it the largest propaganda campaign in history. 57 Unlike other parts of the world, where the progress Wahhabi preaching has been impeded by stubborn adherence to traditional interpretations of Islam, the American Islamic community is relatively new, and therefore, more vulnerable to Saudi influence. Out of thousands, the Wahhabis reportedly control as many as eighty percent of mosques in the U.S., giving them control over the appointment and training of Imams, the content of preaching, and of literature distributed in Islamic bookstores. 58 To win political clout in America, the Saudis deliberately imitated the model of the Jewish lobbying groups. With Saudi backing, American Muslims started organizations like the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR), which was similar to the anti-Defemation League; the American Muslim Council (AMC), which was modeled on the American Jewish Committee; the Muslim Public Affairs Council (MPAC), which was similar to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, and so on. According to Mustafa Elhussein, secretary of a center for Muslim intellectuals known as the Ibn Khaldun Society, “there is a great deal of bitterness that such groups have tarnished the reputation of mainstream Muslims” because “self-appointed leaders... spew hatred toward America and the West and yet claim to be the legitimate spokespersons for the American Muslim community.” Elhussein believes not only that they should “be kept at arm’s length from the political process, but that they should be actively opposed as extremists.” 59 In support of Elhussein contention, it was discovered, in October 2001, that not only was a secretive group of prominent Muslim charities and businesses in Northern Virginia funneling millions of dollars to foreign terrorists, but was part of a suspicious agenda designed to sway the Muslim vote in favour of the Republican party. The probe of the groups in Herndon, Virginia, was the largest federal investigation of its kind in the world. The network was centered around the SAAR Foundation, named after its chief sponsor, Sulaiman Abdul"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"Total War 279 Aziz al Rajhi, head of one of Saudi Arabia’s wealthiest families. The treasurer of SAAR was Cherif Sedky, an American lawyer for the Rahji family, and representative and business partner of Khalid bin Mahfouz. The Safa Group, as the network of organizations are referred to in Herndon, had transmitted more than $26 million in untraceable money overseas, and leaders of the organization committed and conspired to provide material support to terrorist organizations. The president of Safa, Jamal Barzinji, is a former business associate of Youssef Nada. 60 The ties between Nada and Safa were many, as were ties to other Brotherhood leaders. 61 According to David Kane, of Homeland Security, who charged the Safa Group in Herndon, there was no innocent explanation “for the use of layers and layers of transactions between Safa Group companies and charities other than to throw law enforcement authorities off the trail.” The express purpose of the Safa Group, “set up primarily with donations from a wealthy Saudi family, was to fund terrorism and hide millions of dollars.” Kane insisted that the complex nature of “the myriad financial transactions and the fact that much of the money was sent to tax havens with bank secrecy laws make it impossible to trace the final destination of much of the money.” 62 The Safa trust provided funds for a political group called the Islamic Free Market Institute. The nonprofit Islamic Institute was started by Grover Norquist, in collaboration with Karl Rove, now President Bush’s chief political adviser. Grover Norquist is the president of the noted anti-Tax lobbying group, Americans for Tax Reform, and is a well-connected Conservatism activist with close ties to business and to the media. The institute was founded in 1999, and has helped to arrange meetings between senior Bush officials and Islamic leaders. Its chairman was Khaled Saffuri, a Palestinian-American raised in Kuwait who had been an official of the American Muslim Council, a political group in Washington. Saffuri, who has met with many top-level administration officials, including Secretary of State Colin Powell, and FBI Director Robert Mueller, is listed as the treasurer of National Muslims for a Greater America, a defunct political action committee that received contributions from individuals connected to the Safa Group. The Islamic Institute’s founding chairman was a Palestinian American investor from Chicago, Talat Othman. According to the Chicago Tribune, in August 10, 2003: “In 1990, media reports implied that Othman was a front man for [Abdullah Taha] Bakhsh, who had acquired a 17.6 percent stake in Harken Energy Corp. in the 1980s. Serving alongside Othman as a Harken corporate officer: then-presidential son George W. Bush.” 63 Othman was later granted privileged access to George W. Bush when he became president, attending White House meetings with him to discuss Middle East policy, according to records obtained by the National Security News Service. 64 On July 21, 2000, the Republican national convention opened with a duaa, or Muslim benediction, that was offered by Othman."},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 280 The Safa Group was linked to Abdurahman M. Alamoudi, a politically connected Muslim activist, who was welcomed at the White House by former President Bill Clinton and President Bush for his work on behalf of Muslim causes. In the mid 1990s, he helped recruit as many as a hundred “Islamic lay leaders” for the U.S. military. In 2000, Alamoudi reportedly attended a terrorist summit in Beirut, with leaders of Hamas, Hezbollah and al Qaeda. According to an article by Frank Gaffney, Alamoudi had contributed $20,000 to help found Norquist’s Islamic Institute. 65 However, Alamoudi recently pleaded not guilty to an eighteen count federal indictment alleging that he laundered money and violated immigration and customs laws, by accepting $340,000 from the Libyan government, which is considered a state sponsor of terrorism. Safa was also linked to Sami al Arian, a Kuwaiti-Palestinian computer science professor at the University of South Florida. Between 1988 and 1992, Al Arian hosted a series of conferences of the world’s leading terrorists, and openly associated with Hamas officials in the U.S. and elsewhere. Al Arian was also alleged to have “helped oversee terrorist cells in the Middle East,” according to Newsweek. 66 Al Arian and his family were photographed with a beaming Bush and his wife, Laura, during a Florida campaign stop. Norquist, who along with other institute leaders, courted Muslim voters for the Bush 2000 presidential campaign, credits the “Muslim vote” of putting Bush in a position to win the Florida contest. 67 During the 2000 election cycle, Norquist championed the prohibition of “secret evidence”, a personal priority of Al Arian. The following year, Al Arian bestowed on Norquist an award from the National Coalition to Protect Political Freedom for his work against secret evidence. Thanks in large part to Norquist’s efforts, in a presidential campaign debate with Al Gore, George W. Bush pledged, if elected, to prohibit the use of secret evidence, and succeeded in attracting the Muslim vote. Encouraged by his promise, a Michigan umbrella group of more than twenty Arab-American groups came out for Bush, and the American Muslim Political Coordination Council called a press conference in Washington and announced its endorsement of him. Thus, Bush received thousands of votes from Muslims duped by their so- called leaders. Agha Saeed, the AMPCC chairman said, “it won’t be long before political analysts realize that Muslim voters have played a historic role.” 68 Al Arian boasted that he had delivered “considerably more” than the 537 votes that gave Bush his victory in Florida, and allowed him to capture the White House. 69 As Craig Unger describes, “in other words, without the mobilization of Saudi- funded Islamic groups, George W. Bush would not be president today.” 70 In June 2001, Al Arian was invited to the White House, along with a 160 members of the American Muslim Council, to be briefed by Karl Rove. For much of a decade, John Loftus tried unsuccessfully to have Al Arian arrested. Al Arian was finally arrested in February 2003, and was revealed as an FBI informant. The Justice Department accused him of conspiracy to commit murder by suicide attacks in Israel, and said he kept secret his role as a top leader of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad."},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"Total War 281 Coincidentally, al Arian’s attorney also represented Theresa LePore, the local ballots chief in Palm Beach, one of the key problem areas during balloting. Theresa “Madam Butterfly” LePore also assisted a company called Database Technologies (DBT)/ChoicePoint Inc, providing information retrieval from public records data Prior, of which Richard Armitage was a board member prior to his appointment to the State Department. As the Guardian’s Tim Wheeler noted in May 2003: “ChoicePoint Inc, a data-processing firm... is notorious for purging Black and Latino voters in Florida to help George W. Bush steal the 2000 election...” 71 LePore had also moonlighted as a flight attendant on private planes owned by the notorious arms dealer, Adnan Khashoggi. 72 Total War What the neo-conservatives seek is not merely “regime change” in Iraq, but “total war,” as their most influential spokesman, Michael Ledeen, put it. Leedeen is a resident scholar at the right-wing “think-tank”, the American Enterprise Institute, where he works with the former chairman of the Defense Policy Board, Richard Perle. He is also a contributing editor to the U.S. National Review and the Jewish World Review, and was a founding member of the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs, JINSA. In 2003, the Washington Post discovered that he was the only full-time international affairs analyst consulted by Karl Rove, George W. Bush’s closest advisor. 73 Ledeen had been in Italy in the late 1970s, when he consulted for Italian military intelligence, and cultivated strong connections to the right-wing in Italy, including to the notorious P2 Masonic Lodge. 74 When P2 had come under increasing scrutiny in 1979, grandmaster Licio Gelli had reportedly made his base of operations the Montecarlo Comite. Reported members of the Montecarlo Comite are Gelli, Henry Kissinger, Alexander Haig, former Supreme Commander of NATO, and Michael Ledeen. P2 was responsible for Italy’s “Strategy of Tension”, which was a campaign of false-flag terror operations, waged by the Gladio Brigades, constituted from Dulles’ “Stay Behind” network of former Nazis, under the patronage of the CIA and the Mafia. These operations were intended to discredit the increasingly popular Communist Party. In early 1978, Prime Minister Aldo Moro was kidnapped and later assassinated by the so-called “Red brigades”, a pro-Soviet terrorist group. Evidence now exists that shows Moro’s murder was orchestrated by P2, and that both the “Red” and “Black” brigades were heavily penetrated by US intelligence, who are credited with “running” them. The Strategy of Tension campaign culminated in the Bologna train station bombing of 1980. 75 According to Jim Lobe, Ledeen then returned to Washington in 1981 as “anti-terrorism” advisor to Haig, then new secretary of state. Over the next"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"Terrorism and the Illuminati 282 several years, Ledeen used his position as consultant to Haig, the Pentagon and the National Security Council under Ronald Reagan, to boost the notion of a global terrorist conspiracy based in the Kremlin, whose KGB pulled the strings of all of the world’s key terrorist groups, especially in the Middle East. 76 Ledeen was a major figure in the Iran-Contra Affair. As a consultant of National Security Adviser Robert C. McFarlane, Ledeen vouched for Iranian intermediary Manucher Ghorbanifar, and met with Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres, and officials of the Israeli Foreign Ministry and the CIA, to arrange meetings with high-ranking Iranian officials and the much-criticized weapons-for-hostages deal with Iran, that would become known as the Iran- Contra scandal. Ledeen had, along with Arnaud de Borchgrave, in The New Republic, “exposed” some details of Billy Carter’s dealings with the Muammar Gaddafi regime in Libya, which deligitimized his brother’s presidency. Ledeen seems to be again involved in the fabrication of evidence, this time in the instance of the forged documents “uncovered” by Italian intelligence. 77 These depicted an attempt by Iraq’s Saddam Hussein regime to purchase yellowcake uranium from Niger, which formed the basis of President Bush’s support for the invasion of Iraq, and which subsequently unraveled into the “Plamegate” scandal. In Ledeen’s own words, on a leadership trait he admires, quoted from his book Universal Fascism: In order to achieve the most noble accomplishments, the leader may have to ‘enter into evil’. This is the chilling insight that has made Machiavelli so feared, admired and challenging... we are rotten.... It’s true that we can achieve greatness if, and only if, we are properly led. 78 “Regime change” must be achieved by any means necessary in Iraq, Iran, Syria, Saudi Arabia and the Palestinian Authority. Leeden stated, at a meeting of the American Enterprise Institute, involving Richard Perle, Newt Gingrich, Nathan Sharansky and James Woolsey: No stages. This is total war. We are fighting a variety of enemies. There are lots of them out there. All this talk about first we are going to do Afghanistan, then we will do Iraq... this is entirely the wrong way to go about it. If we just let our vision of the world go forth, and we embrace it entirely and we don’t try to piece together clever diplomacy, but just wage a total war... our children will sing great songs about us years from now.” 79 In his book, Machiavelli on Modern Leadership: Why Machiavelli’s Iron Rules Are as Timely and Important Today as Five Centuries Ago, Michael Ledeen proclaimed, “Change – above all violent change – is the essence of human history.” 80 Ultimately, Ledeen believes that violence in the service of the spread of “freedom” around the world is merely a continuation of America’s revolutionary struggle. “Total war” says Ledeen, “not only destroys the enemy’s"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"Total War 283 military forces, but also brings the enemy society to an extremely personal point of decision, so that they are willing to accept a reversal of the cultural trends. The sparing of civilian lives cannot be the total war’s first priority... The purpose of total war is to permanently force your will onto another people.” 81 "},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"Introduction: The Clash of Civilizations 1 Robison, John, Proofs of a Conspiracy , p. 84. 2 Svali.
