They gave us the news straight, which they don't al ways do. They told us what was going on without the cynicism and without the a tti-tude. For that, they deserve our thanks and our admira-tion. But it shouldn't take a national catastrophe of unp ar-alleled magnitude to get the news without the usual biases. Before September 11, the media elites, too often, behaved badly. And they will again. It is, a fter all, who they are. And that is what this book is all about. Introduction \"They Think You're a Traitor\" I have it on good authority that my liberal friends in the news media, who account for about 98 percent of all my friends in t he news media, are planning a big party to congratulate me for writing this book. As I understand it, media stars like Dan Rather and Tom Brokaw and Peter Jenn ings will make speeches thank-ing me for actually saying what they either c an't or won't. They'll thank me for saying that they really do slant the news in a leftward direction. They'll thank me for pointing out that, when critic ized, they reflexively deny their bias while at the same time saying their crit ics are the ones who are really biased. They'll thank me for observing that in their opin-ion liberalism on a whole range of issues from abortion and affirm ative action to the death penalty and gay rights is not really liberal at all , but merely reasonable and civilized. Finally, they'll thank me for agreeing w ith Roger Ailes of Fox News that the media divide Americans into two groups - m oderates and right-wing nuts. My sources also tell me that Rather, Brokaw, or Jen nings - no one is sure which one yet - will publicly applaud me for alerting the networks that one reason they're all losing viewers by the truckload is that fewer and fewer Americans trust them anymore. He'll applaud, too, when I say that the media need to be more introspective, keep an open mind when critics point to specific examples of liberal bias, and systemati-cally work to end slant ed reporting. According to the information I've been able to gath er, this wonder-ful event will take place at a fancy New York City hotel, at eight o'clock in the evening, on a Thursday, exactly three days after Hell freeze s over. Okay, maybe that's too harsh. Maybe, in a cheap att empt to be funny, I'm maligning and stereotyping the media elites as a bu nch of powerful, arrogant, thin-skinned celebrity journalists who can dish it out, which they routinely do on their newscasts, but can't take it. Except I don 't think so, for reasons I will come to shortly. First let me say that this was a very difficult boo k to write. Not because I had trouble uncovering the evidence that there is in fa ct a ten-dency to slant the news in a liberal way. That part was easy. Just tur n on your TV set and it's there. Not every night and not in every story, but it's there too often in too many stories, mostly about the big social and cultu ral issues of our time. What made doing this book so hard was that I was wr iting about peo-ple I have known for many years, people who are, or once were, my friends. It's not easy telling you that Dan Rather, whom I have worked wit h and genuinely liked for most of my adult life, really is two very dif-feren t people; and while one Dan is funny and generous, the other is ruth-less and u nforgiving. I would have"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"preferred to write about strangers. It would have b een a lot easier. Nor is it easy to write about other friends at CBS News, including an important executive who told me that of course the networks t ilt left - but also warned that if I ever shared that view with the outside wo rld he would deny the conversation ever took place. I think this is what they call a delicious irony. A news executive who can tell the truth about liberal bias in network news - but only if he thinks he can deny ever saying it! And these are the people who keep i nsisting that all they want to do is share the truth with the American people! It wasn't easy naming names, but I have. I kept thi nking of how my colleagues treat cigarette, tire, oil, and other company execu tives in the media glare. The news business deserves the same hard look because i t is even more important. Fortunately, I was on the inside as a news correspo ndent for twenty-eight years, from 1972, when I joined CBS News as a twenty-six-y ear-old, until I left in the summer of 2000. So I know the business, and I know what they don't want the public to see. Many of the people I spoke to, as sources, would no t let me use their names, which is understandable. They simply have too much to lose. You can talk freely about many things when you work for the big net-wor k news operations, but liberal bias is not one of them. Take it from me, t he liberals in the newsroom tend to frown on such things. And there are a few things that are not in this boo k - information I picked up and confirmed but left out because writing about it would cause too much damage to people, some powerful, some not, even if I didn' t use any names. But much of what I heard didn't come from Deep Thro at sources in parking garages at three o'clock in the morning, but from what the big network stars said on their own newscasts and in other big public arenas, for the world to hear. When Peter Jennings, for example, was asked about l iberal bias, on Larry King Live on May 15,2001, he said, \"I think bias is very largely in the eye of the beholder.\" This might offend the two or three conse rvative friends I have, but I think Peter is right, except that instead of saying \"very largely\" he should have left it as \"sometimes in the eye of the behold er.\" Because it's true that some people who complain about lib-eral bias think Al Roker the weatherman is out to get conservatives just because he forecast r ain on the Fourth of July. And some people who say they want the news without bias really mean they want it without liberal bias. Conservative bias would be ju st fine. Some of Dan, Tom, and Peter's critics would think i t fine if a story about affirmative action began, \"Affirmative action, the program that no right-thinking American could possibly support, was taken up by the U.S. Supreme Court today.\" But I wouldn't. Bias is bias. It's important to know, too, that there isn't a wel l-orchestrated, vast left-wing conspiracy in America's newsrooms. The bi tter truth, as we'll see, is arguably worse. Even though I attack liberal bias, not liberal valu es, I will be portrayed by some of my old friends as a right-wing ideologue. I ndeed, I've already faced this accusation. When I wrote an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal in 1996 about liberal bias among the media elites, my professiona l life turned upside down. I became radioactive. People I had known and worked w ith for years stopped talking to me. When a New York Post reporter asked Rather a bout my op-ed, Rather replied"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"that he would not be pressured by \"political activi sts\" with a \"political agenda\" \"inside or outside\" of CBS News. The \"insid e\" part, I think, would be me. Sadly, Dan doesn't think that any critic who utters the words \"liberal bias\" can be legitimate, even if that critic worked with Dan himself for two decades. Such a critic cannot possibly be well-meaning. To Dan, s uch a critic is Spiro Agnew reincarnated, spouting off about those nat-tering n abobs of negativism. Too bad. A little introspection could go a long way. I know that no matter how many examples I give of l iberal bias, no matter how carefully I try to explain how it happens, some wil l dismiss my book as the product of bad blood, of a \"feud\" between Dan Rathe r and me. How do I know this? Because that is exactly how Tom Brokaw characterize d it when I wrote a second Wall Street Journal piece about liberal bias in May 2001. In it I said that as hard as it may be to believe, I'm convinced that Dan and Tom and Peter \"don't even know what liberal bias is .\" \"The problem,\" I wrote, \"is that Mr. Rather and the other evening stars thi nk that liberal bias means just one thing: going hard on Republicans and easy on Democrats. But real media bias comes not so much from what party they attack. Liberal bias is the result of how they see the world.\" The very same morning the op-ed came out, Tom Broka w was on C-SPAN promoting his new book, when Brian Lamb, the host, asked about my op-ed. Tom smiled and said he was \"bemused\" by the col-umn, adding, \"I know th at he's [Goldberg's] had an ongoing feud with Dan; I wish he would confine it t o that, frankly.\" Here's a bulletin: in my entire life I have mention ed Dan Rather's name only once in a column, be it about liberal media bias or anything else. Five years earlier, when I wrote my first and only other piece about liberal bias, I did in fact talk about the \"media elites,\" of which Dan su rely is one. So counting that (and before this book), I have written exactly two times about Dan Rather and liberal bias - or, for that mat-ter, about Dan Rath er and any subject, period! Two times! And that, to Tom Brokaw, constitutes a \" feud,\" which strikes me as a convenient way to avoid an inconvenient subject tha t Tom and many of the other media stars don't especially like to talk about or, for that matter, think too deeply about. I also suspect that, thanks to this book, I will he ar my named linked to the words \"disgruntled former employee\" and \"vindictive .\" While it's true I did leave CBS News when it became clear that Dan would \"never\" (his word) forgive me for writing about liberal bias in the news, let me state the following without any fear whatsoever that I might be wrong: Anyone w ho writes a book to be vindictive is almost certainly insane and at any mo ment could find himself standing before a judge who, acting well within the law, might sign official papers that could result in that \"vindictive\" perso n being committed to a secure facility for people with mental defects. I don't know this from firsthand experience, but my guess is it would be easier to give birth to triplets than write a book, especi ally if you've never written one before. Staring at a blank page on a computer s creen for hours and hours and hours is not the most efficient way to be vin-dicti ve. It seems to me that staring at the TV set for a couple of seconds and b lowing a raspberry at the anchorman would take care of any vin-dictive feelin gs one might have. So, does all of this lead to the inevitable conclus ion that all the big-time"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"media stars bat from the left side of the plate? Do es it mean that there are no places in the media where the bent is undeniably co nser-vative? Of course not! Talk radio in America is overwhelmingly right of ce nter. And there are plenty of conservative syndicated newspaper columnists. There are \"magazines of opinion\" like the Weekly Standard and National Review. There 's Fox News on cable TV, which isn't afraid to air intelligent con-servative voices. And there's even John Stossel at ABC News, who rou-tinely challenges the conventional liberal wisdom on all sorts of big issues. But, the best I can figure, John's just about the only one, which says a lot about the lack of di versity inside the network newsrooms. On February 15,1996, two days after my op-ed on lib eral bias came out in the Wall Street Journal, Howard Kurtz of the Washington Post wrote about the firestorm it was creating. \"The author was not some conservative media critic, but Bernard Goldberg, the veteran CBS News correspo ndent. His poison-pen missive has angered longtime colleagues, from news division president Andrew Heyward and anchor Dan Rather on down.\" Kurtz quoted several dumbfounded CBS News people, o ne of whom suggested I resign, and ended his story with something I told h im, more out of sadness than anything else. Journalists, I said, \"admire people on the outside who come forward with unpopular views, who want to make some thing better. But if you're on the inside and you raise a serious question abou t the news, they don't embrace you. They don't admire you. They think you' re a traitor.\" I am not a traitor, nor am I the enemy. And neither are the millions of Americans who agree with me. The enemy is arrogance . And I'm afraid it's on the other side of the camera. The News Mafia I can't say the precise moment it hit me, but I do know that it was on a Sunday night while I was watching the HBO series The Sopra nos. That's when I started noticing that the wise guys in the mob and the news guys at the networks had the same kind of people skills. Maybe Tony had somebody killed. Or maybe just rough ed up. Or it might have been only words, something he said to his psychiatrist. I'm not sure. But the more I watched the more I saw how striking the simi-lariti es are between the Mafia and the media. And, let the record show, I mean no disrespect to t he Mafia. In between hijacking trucks and throwing people off bridges, t he wise guys are always going on about honor and loyalty and family, the holy tri nity as far as guys with names like Tony Soprano and Paulie Walnuts are conc erned. These are people who are exquisitely and mon-umentally delusional, of co urse. But it's this fundamental belief - that despite the bad PR, deep down where it really counts, they are just a bunch of honorable men who care abo ut the important things in life and only hurt people who hurt them - that allo ws the wise guys to crush anyone who gets in their way.   , It's the same with the News Mafia. On The Sopranos., the biggest sin a wise guy can co mmit is to open his big mouth to the wrong people and blab about family business. On this matter, there is no difference - no difference whatsoever! - between th e wise guys who operate in"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"the dark shadows of the underworld and the news guy s who supposedly operate in the bright sunlight. If a wise guy on The Sopranos - or one from the real-life Gambinos or Bonannos or Colombos - becomes too chat ty about dirty little family secrets, there's a very good chance he will get ver y unhealthy very quickly. Same with the News Mafia. Trust me. I'm speaking from up-close-and-personal f irsthand expe-rience, from twenty-eight years on the inside as a news correspo ndent with one of the three big families, CBS News. So, what happened? Well, as Tony Soprano might put it to his old pal Pussy Bompensiero in the Bada Bing! Lounge: Bernie G open ed his big mouth to the wrong people - and he got whacked! (Which is precisely wh at happened to Pussy after he opened his big mouth to the wrong people.) The Don in this case is actually The Dan. Dan Rathe r. Capo di tutti news guys. It's not generally known, but The Dan even speaks h is own secret language, which around CBS is known as Dan-ish (it shouldn't be con fused with the language they speak in Denmark). In Dan-ish, \"it's all my fault\" means \"it's all your fault\"... \"no problem\" means \"big prob-lem\" ... \"do n't worry, amigo\" means \"worry a lot, you unworthy piece of crap!\" In The D an's presence, you get the feeling that if things start going wrong for The Da n, something real bad could start going wrong - for you! If CBS News were a prison instead of a journalistic enterprise, three-quarters of the producers and 100 percent of the vice presid ents would be Dan's bitches. In the 1980s there actually was a vice president at CBS News whose unofficial title was \"vice president in charge of Dan Rather.\" His main job was to make sure Dan was happy. This was a very important job. But in spite of the aura of fear that surrounds The Dan, he's also one of the most generous people I've ever known. At holiday ti me, I would often get a nice gift from The Dan. And if you were one of his loyal guys - and for twenty-five years, I was - he'd also send nice handwritten note s telling you how much he appreciated you being around. To this day - even th ough he's the one who wanted me whacked - I still have an old framed picture on my wall at home in Miami of The Dan, with his arm around my young son, Brian, a nd me at CBS News in New York, all of us with big smiles. And he's also funny, in a disarming, folksy kind of way. If you've ever tuned in to CBS News on Election Night, you might think you hit the wrong button on your remote and stumbled onto an old rerun of Hee Haw. \"Democrats and Republicans are nervous as pigs in a packing plant over these returns because the polls have closed and we don't know the results.\" Must be a hot race, huh, Dan? \"Why, it's hotter than an armadillo's hide at a Wes t Texas picnic on the Fourth of July.\" How 'bout that cliffhanger down in Florida, Dan, be tween Dubya and Al Gore? \"That race is tighter than the rusted lug nuts on a '55 Ford.\" Looks like Dubya's got the lead. \"Yeah, but that lead is shakier than cafeteria Jell -O.\" Those boys sure are playin' hardball, huh, Dan? \"Nasty enough to gag a buzzard.\" Who do you think will win? \"I wouldn't touch that one with an eleven-foot pole , which is the pole I reserve"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"for things I won't touch with a ten-foot pole.\" That's Dan playing Will Rogers on pork rinds. It's all written down and rehearsed, of course, but Dan makes it sound like g enuine, off-the-cuff, good-ol'-boy ad-libs. I know that Dan Rather real well. And I like him. But a few years ago, I got to meet the other Dan Ra ther, the one behind the big anchorman smile. The one the public doesn't get to see. The one who operates with the cool precision of a Mafia hit man who kiss es you on the cheek right before he puts a bullet through your eyeball. So when that Dan assured me, sounding more like The Godfather than The Anchorman, that \"Bernie, we were friends yesterday, we're friends today, and we'll be friends tomorrow\" - I knew I was dead. It was just a matter of time. February 13,1996, was the day I committed my unpard onable sin and began to die. Which was what, exactly? What terrible, unforgivabl e crime had I perpetrated against The Dan? Did I sell crack to his kids? No. Did I spill a drink on his wife's head at the CBS N ews Christmas party? No. Did I sneak into his office after work one night an d make off with one of his Savile Row suits, which are tailored by the same ho use that made Edward R. Murrow's clothes, and which cost more than my house ? No. But I wish I had. What I did was worse. Much worse, as far as The Dan was con-cerned. I violated the code of omerta, the sacred code of silence that both wise guys and news guys live and die by. I said out loud what millions of TV news viewers al l over America know and have been complaining about for years: that too often, D an and Peter and Tom and a lot of their foot soldiers don't deliver the news s traight, that they have a liberal bias, and that no matter how often the netw ork stars deny it, it is true. I would have been a lot better off if I had spilled a drink on his wife's head, sold crack to his kids, and stolen one of his Savil e Row suits! Actually I didn't say the networks were biased - I wrote it in one of the most important and widely read newspapers in the entire country, the Wall Street Journal, whose editorial page liberals love to hate . In an op-ed piece, I wrote, \"There are lots of reasons fewer people are watch-i ng network news, and one of them, I'm more convinced than ever, is that our vie wers simply don't trust us. And for good reason. \"The old argument that the networks and other 'medi a elites' have a liberal bias is so blatantly true that it's hardly worth discuss ing any-more. No, we don't sit around in dark corners and plan strategies on h ow we're going to slant the news. We don't have to. It comes naturally to most reporters.\" As my old buddy Wayne, who's never set foot in a ne wsroom in his life, put it, \"What's the big deal; everybody knows that's true.\" Maybe, Wayne, but there's a big difference between when Rush Limbaugh or Bill B uckley says it and when a CBS News correspondent says it. This was coming from the inside, from one of Rather 's guys. Limbaugh could rave"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"on about the liberal media all he wanted and the me dia elites would brush him off like a flake of dandruff on a blue suit. If Wil liam F. Buckley had written, word for word, what I had written, Dan Rather would have yawned and jumped in his limousine and headed for lunch at The Four Seas ons. Limbaugh and Buckley and all those other \"right-win gers\" - every-body to the right of Lenin is a \"right-winger,\" as far as the m edia elites are concerned - were all a bunch of Republican partisans. But I wasn't. I was a newsman. One of their newsmen ! I had done a thousand stories for Walter Cronkite and Dan Rather on the C BS Evening News and later as the senior correspondent on 48 Hours, the prime-tim e show Rather fronted. They don't let you stick around for more than two decade s if you've got a political ax to grind. No, I was what The Dan and his nominal bosses in the front office call all of their reporters and producers: objectiv e... fair... balanced. I'll bet anything those are the exact words CBS New s would have used to defend me if I had reported a story for the Evening News t hat came down hard on big business or the military or even the church. CBS Ne ws would have said, Bernie has a well-deserved reputation for being objective, fair, and balanced, and we stand by Bernie and our story. But this piece I had written for the Wall Street Jo urnal wasn't about business or the military or the church or any other safe tar get. Writing about the evils of business or the military or the church is like t aking a walk in the park. I had just taken a stroll through a field of land min es. Taking on the pope is one thing. Taking on the media elites is quite another. And taking them on from the inside - violating their sacred code omerta - is a sin. A mortal sin. It's funny how some of the biggest, most dramatic c hanges in our lives happen almost by accident. If we hadn't gone to that parti cular drug-store to buy toothpaste and tissues on that particular day, we m ight not have met an old friend whom we hadn't seen in years, who invited us to a party where we met somebody's accountant, who walked us over to this s choolteacher whom we fell in love with and married. Go to a dif-ferent drugstore and wind up with a different life. Which brings us to Hurricane Andrew, the costliest natural disaster in the entire history of the United States, which just hap pened to blow through my house and thousands of others in South Florida in 1 992. This brought me into contact for the very first time with a good ol' boy named Jerry Kelley, a chain-smoking, fifty-something building contrac-tor who grew up in Enterprise, Alabama, and who makes Gomer Pyle sound like Lauren ce Olivier. Without Hurricane Andrew there would have been no J erry Kelley. And without Jerry Kelley there would have been no Wall Street J ournal op-ed piece that changed my life forever. Jerry Kelley saved my family and me. He repaired th e damage the hurricane had done to our house. He was always there when we need ed him. And we became friends, a kind of odd couple. We talked often, mos tly about politics and current events, which he loved. And on February 8, 1996, Jerry Kelley called me at home, wonder-ing whether I had caught the CBS Evening News that night. \"Did you see that 'Reality Check' story on Dan Rath er tonight?\" he wanted to know, sounding even more like a cracker than he usu ally did, if that was"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"possible. Jerry wasn't an angry kind of guy, but he was pretty hot that night. I told him I missed the Dan Rather newscast and asked what the problem was. \"The problem,\" he said, \"is that you got too many s nippy wise guys doin' the news, that's what the problem is.\" We went around l ike this for a while, and he told me to get a tape of the news and watch it. The n \"you tell me if there's a problem.\" Fair enough. The next day I went into the CBS News bureau in Miami to watch a videotape of the story that had Jerry so worked up. The reporter was Eric Engberg, a Washington corresp ondent whose \"Reality Check\" was about presidential candidate Steve Forbes and h is flat tax, which was the centerpiece of the Forbes campaign. Not exactly a sexy subject. So what's the big deal, I wondered. But as I watched the videotape, it became obvious that this was a ha tchet job, an editorial masquerading as real news, a cheap shot designed to make fun of Forbes - a rich conservative white guy, the safest of all media tar gets - and ridicule his tax plan. Still, blasting the flat tax wasn't in the same lea gue as taking shots at people who are against affirmative action or abortion, two of the more popular targets of the liberal media elites. How worked up was I su p-posed to get... over the flat tax? But the more I watched the more I saw that this sto ry wasn't simply about a presidential candidate and a tax plan. It was about something much bigger, something too much of big-time TV journalism had be come: a showcase for smart-ass reporters with attitudes, reporters who d on't even pretend to hide their disdain for certain people and cer-tain ideas that they and their sophisticated friends don't particularly like. Rather introduced Engberg's piece with the standard stuff about how it would \"look beyond the promises to the substance\" of the Forbes flat tax. Television news anchors enjoy using words like \"sub-stance,\" m ostly because a half-hour newscast (about twenty-one min-utes after commercia ls) has so little of it. Engberg's voice covered pictures of Steve Forbes on the campaign trail. \"Steve Forbes pitches his flat-tax scheme as an economic e lixir, good for everything that ails us.\" Scheme? Elixir? What the hell kind of language is t hat, I wondered? These were words that conjured up images of con artists, like Doctor Feelgood selling worthless junk out of the back of his wagon. But that was just a little tease to get us into the tent. Then Engberg interviewed three different tax experts. Every sing le one of them opposed the flat tax. Every single one! Where was the fairness and bal-ance Rather was always preaching about? Wasn't there any expert - e ven one - in the entire United States who thought the flat tax might work? Of course there was. There were Milton Friedman and Merton Miller, both of the University of Chicago and both Nobel Prize winners in economics. There was James Buchanan of George Mason University, another Nobel laureate. There were also Harvey Rosen of Princeton, William Poole of Brown, and Robert Barro of Harvard. All of them were on the record as supporting the fl at tax to one degree or another. Engberg could have found a bunch of economists to s upport the flat tax, if he had wanted to. But putting on a supporter of the fl at tax would have defeated"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"the whole purpose of the piece, which was to have a few laughs at Steve Forbes's expense. There is absolutely no way - not one chance in a mi llion - that Engberg or Rather would have aired a flat-tax story with that same con-temptuous tone if Teddy Kennedy or Hillary Clinton had come up with t he idea. But even if you opposed the flat tax, even if you t hought it was a bad idea that helped only the wealthiest Americans - fat cats lik e Steve Forbes himself - what about simple journalistic fairness? What about pres enting two sides? Isn't that what Rather was always saying CBS News was about: o bjectivity, fairness, balance? And then Engberg crossed that fuzzy little line tha t's supposed to separate news from entertainment. He decided it was time to amuse his audience. And who could blame him? The flat tax didn't have much pizzazz by showbiz standards. The audience might lose interest and, God forbid, chang e the channel. In the United States of Entertainment there is no greater sin tha n to bore the audience. A TV reporter could get it wrong from time to time. He c ould be snippy and snooty. But he could not be boring. Which is why Eric Engberg decided to play David Let terman and do a takeoff of his Top Ten list. \"Forbes's Number One Wackiest Flat-Tax Promise,\" En gberg told the audience, is the candidate's belief that it would give parents \" more time to spend with their children and each other.\" Wacky? This was a perfectly acceptable word in the United States of Entertainment to describe, say, a Three Stooges mov ie. Or Hamlet, starring Jerry Lewis. Or My Fair Lady, with Chris Rock playing Pro -fessor Higgins. But \"wacky\" seemed an odd word to describe a seriou s idea to over-haul America's ten-trillion-page tax code that enables lobbyists t o donate tons of money to politicians who then use this same Byzantine tax co de to hand out goodies to the very same special interests that just gave them all that money. If anything is \"wacky,\" it's the current tax sys-tem, not an hones t attempt to replace it with something new. Besides, what Forbes meant is that since many Ameri cans - not just the wealthy - would pay less tax under his plan, they might not h ave to work as many hours and might actually have more time to spend at home with their families. Maybe it's true and maybe it isn't, but is \"Svacky\" the faires t and most objective way to describe it? Can you imagine, in your wildest dreams, a network news reporter calling Hillary Clinton's health care plan \"wacky\"? Can you imagine Dan Rather or any other major American news anchorman allowing it? And finally, the coup de grace, the knife to Steve Forbes's throat as Engberg went on camera to end his story. The \"on camera,\" a s we call it in the TV news business, is when the reporter gets to look the vie wer in the eye and deliver a sermonette. This is when the reporter, if he hasn't been slanting the news up to this point, will often give you a little editorial just to make sure you know how you're supposed to think about the subject at h and. Eric Engberg ended his little vaudeville act thus: \"The fact remains: The flat tax is a giant, untested theory. One econo-mist suggested, before we put it in, we should test it out someplace - like Albania.\" Engberg flashed his sign ature smirk and signed off - \"Eric Engberg, CBS News, Washington.\""},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"There is junk science, junk food, and junk bonds. T his was junk journalism. I don't believe for a second that Eric Engberg woke up that morning and said, \"I think I'll go on the air tonight and make fun of St eve Forbes.\" The problem is that so many TV journalists simply don't know what to think about certain issues until the New York Times and the Washington Post te ll them what to think. Those big, important newspapers set the agenda that netwo rk news people follow. In this case the message from Olympus was clear: We do n't like the flat tax. So nei-ther did Eric Engberg, and neither did anyone a t CBS News who put his story on the air. It's as simple as that. That the flat tax was a conservative idea only made the job of bash-ing it more fun. Yes, it's true that a number of conservative p oliticians came out against it. Lamar Alexander, for one, called it \"a truly nu tty idea.\" But Alexander, and some others who came out against Forbes's version o f the flat tax - like Pat Buchanan, who said it was a plan that favored \"the boys down at the yacht basin\" - just happened to be run-ning for president agains t Steve Forbes. That raises a few legitimate questions about their motives. Make no mistake: the flat tax is fundamentally cons ervative. In Newsweek, George Will wrote, \"In the 1990s conservatism had two genu inely radical proposals for domestic reform, proposals that would have fundamen tally altered the political culture. Term limits for mem-bers of Congress would have ended careerism, today's strongest motive for entering, and for part icular behavior in, politics. A flat tax would have taken the tax code out of pla y as an instrument for dispensing political favors, and would have put out of business a parasite class of tax lawyers and lobbyists in Washington.\" By and large, the angst over the flat tax came from the Left. Which makes perfect sense. Liberals have an uneasy feeling abou t tax cuts in general and are downright hostile to the kinds of cuts that benefit the wealthy in particular, even if they also help a lot of other Americans. Th ey may argue against the flat tax on economic grounds, which is fair enough since there are legitimate questions and concerns about a flat-tax rate. But m uch of the opposition from the Left had little to do with economics. It was vi sceral, from the same dark region that produces envy and the seemingly unquenc hable liberal need to wage class warfare. Paul Begala, the political strategist who worked on both the 1992 and 1996 Clinton-Gore campaigns, charmingly explained the Le ft's philosophy on people with money when, according to Bob Wood-ward's The A genda, he told Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, \"Fuck them [the rich].\" Karl Marx couldn't have said it better. So the Left routinely uses words like \"scheme\" inst ead of the more neutral \"plan\" to describe tax cuts that favor \"the wrong p eople.\" Sometimes they put the word \"risky\" before \"scheme\" to make it sound r eally scary. Al Gore did precisely that, about a hundred times a day, when h e was running for president against George W. Bush. I under-stand why Al Gore a nd other liberals call something they don't like a \"scheme.\" Politicians a nd partisans are allowed to do that. But should supposedly objective people lik e news reporters, people like Eric Engberg, use that kind of loaded language? Sho uld a journalistic enterprise like CBS News - which claims to stand for fairness and objectivity - allow words like \"scheme\" and \"wacky\" in what is sup-posed to b e a straight news story about a legitimate candidate running for president of the United States?"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Engberg's piece - its strident, mocking tone, its l ack of objectivity, its purposeful omission of anyone who supported the fla t tax - was like a TV campaign commercial paid for by Opponents of the St eve Forbes Flat Tax. From top to bottom the Engberg piece was breathtaki ng in its lack of fairness. So how could CBS put it on the air? Well, news fans , here's one of those dirty little secrets journalists are never supposed to re veal to the regular folks out there in the audience: a reporter can find an exper t to say anything the reporter wants - anything! Just keep calling until one of the experts says what you need him to say and tell him you'll be right do wn with your camera crew to interview him. If you find an expert who says, \"You know, I think that flat tax just might work and here's why...\" you thank him, h ang up, and find another expert. It's how journalists sneak their own person al views into stories in the guise of objective news reporting. Because the repo rter can always say, \"Hey, I didn't say the flat tax stinks - the guy from that Washington think tank did!\" It happens all the time. I don't know Steve Forbes. I've never met him. I do n't even buy his magazine. And I had never voted for a Republican candidate fo r presi-dent in my entire life! But he was a serious, intelligent man seeking the most important job in our country, and what CBS News had just done to him was shameful and not worthy of an important network news organization. So I called Jeff Fager, who had just taken over as executive producer of the CBS Evening News. I had known Jeff for more than ten ye ars. I asked him how in the world he could have put that story on the air. Fage r didn't remember any details of the Engberg report. That's how uncontroversial i t was to him. I told Fager I had been complaining privately about bias at CBS News for years, that I always kept it in-house, but this time was d iffer-ent. This time, I told him, I was going to write about it, and then maybe he and the other people who decide what gets on the air would listen. Jeff Fager is an interesting guy. Funny. Smart. Eas ygoing. But in some ways he's too cool. Nothing fazes him. Jeff is the kind of gu y who never suffers a crisis of confidence, not on the outside where you could t ell, anyway. From what I could tell by working with him over the years, Jeff is someone who is more in touch with his \"inner self\" than all those self-est eem gurus who show up on PBS during a pledge drive put together. Which is probab ly why he wasn't upset with the Engberg hatchet job. So I sat down and started writing the op-ed piece. The way I saw it, I wasn't taking on Engberg or Rat her or CBS News for airing one snooty story about some politician's tax plan. For me, this was about a nagging problem that none of the big shots would ta ke seriously. It was about the liberal biases that overwhelm straight news rep orting. I knew, of course, that The Dan didn't tolerate dis sent. I knew that to Dan Rather dissent was betrayal. As Andrew Heyward, the president of CBS News, once told me: \"Dan can't distin-guish between mainstream, legitimate criticism and criticism coming from extr emists. It's all the same to him. He just can't separate one from the other.\" He yward also said, \"If anyone around here ever takes Dan on, he'll find a way to get even.\" Even though I knew how unforgiving Dan might be, I sure as hell wasn't trying to be a martyr. I couldn't afford to lose my job over this, not with a mortgage, wife, and kids. My son, Brian, by this time was at Carnegie Mellon University, where the cost of tuition is about the same as the cost of the space shuttle. My"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"daughter, Catherine, who was only seven, would be i n college soon enough. CBS News was paying the bills, and I wasn't about t o throw it all away because of a lousy piece on the evening news. But I felt I had to say something where it might get attention and have some impact. My in-hou se protests hadn't worked, but maybe an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal would open my colleagues' eyes to what everyone else could see - the bias that showed up too often on the evening news. Over the years I had spoken to Heyward and a few ot hers dozens of times about bias on the evening news and other programs. You ca n't talk directly to the anchorman about such things, because anchormen in g eneral don't do well with criticism. They're like royalty. Which means everyo ne is always kissing their royal ass, and after a while they behave more like kings than journalists. Sure, they may have to take crap from time to time from t hose pain-in-the-ass TV critics, but guys like Dan Rather sure as hell aren 't about to take it from their own reporters, no matter how diplomatically w e might deliver it. And if you offend The Dan, The Dan can keep you off the ai r, which for a TV reporter can be a very bad thing - like the end of your live lihood. The bias I'm talking about, by the way, isn't so mu ch political bias of the Democratic-versus-Republican sort. There is that, f or sure, but I know that reporters would tear down their own liberal grandmo thers if they thought it would make them look tough and further their career s. For me that isn't the real problem. The problem comes in the big social and cu ltural issues, where we often sound more like flacks for liberal causes than obje ctive journalists. Why were we doing the work of the homeless lobby by exaggerating the number of homeless people on the streets of America? And why were we portraying them as regular folks just like you and me when we all knew they were overwhelmingly alcoholics and drug addicts and schizophrenics? Why were we doing PR for the AIDS lobby by spreadin g an epi-demic of fear, telling our viewers about how AIDS was about to bre ak out into mainstream heterosexual America, which simply was not true? Why did we give so much time on the evening news to liberal femi-nist organizations, like NOW, and almost no time to cons ervative women who oppose abortion? I always had expressed my concerns privately, like a good, if some-what disgruntled, soldier. All I wanted was a discussion , someone to take these concerns seriously. But no one ever did. I admit it: when I got off the phone with Jeff Fage r, I was angry. Maybe it was what I perceived as his indifference. To this day I 'm not sure. I just felt that I had to make my case. Out loud. Jerry Kelley from Enterprise, Alabama, spotted the bias in the Engberg report. Jerry Kelley spotted the wise guy tone and the one- sidedness. And Jerry Kelley is a general building contractor, not a newsman. Who didn't find anything wrong with Engberg's piece ? First off, Engberg didn't. His producer in Washington didn't. The Evening News senior producer in Washington didn 't. Jeff Fager, the executive producer of the CBS Eveni ng News in New York, didn't. His team of senior producers in New York didn't."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Andrew Heyward, the CBS News president and Harvard Phi Beta Kappa, didn't. And finally, Dan Rather, the anchorman and managing editor of the CBS Evening News, didn't. Not one of them spotted anything wrong with a story that no one should have let on the air in the first place. These are people so sensitive and so \"in tune\" with our politically correct times that they'd practically go into cardiac arres t if a reporter used the word \"Indian\" instead of \"Native American\" on the air. O r said \"handicapped\" instead of \"disabled\" - or better yet, \"physically chal-len ged.\" These journalists can spot a slight a mile away but could not see anythin g wrong with one of their own mocking the flat tax proposed by a rich white guy r unning for the Republican presidential nomination. So how was Jerry Kelley able to see something that all the high-priced, big-shot network journalists couldn't see? It's easy. Jerry' s not part of their crowd. More to the point, they'd rather eat rat poison tha n be part of his. Except for Rather. Rather might wear custom-tailore d British suits and live on Park Avenue, but he has never forgotten his own roo ts: that his father, \"Rags,\" dug ditches in East Texas during the Great Depressi on while his mother, Byrl, was a waitress. Most of the others don't know peopl e like Jerry Kelley, or people like Dan's father or mother, for that matter . They don't have blue-collar people like that in their families. They don't have blue-collar friends, and they don't want any. They don't talk to people like Jerry Kelley, and they certainly don't listen to people like Jerry Kelley. Too many news people, especially the ones at worldw ide headquar-ters in New York, where all the big decisions are made, basical ly talk to other people just like themselves. What the journalist John Podhoretz said about New Yorkers in general is especially true of the New York media el ite in particular: they \"can easily go through life never meeting anybody who ha s a thought different from their own.\" Far-fetched? Just think back to that famous observa tion by the New Yorker's otherwise brilliant film critic Pauline Kael, who i n 1972 couldn't figure out how Richard Nixon had won the presidency. \"I can't believe it!\" she said. \"I don't know a sin gle person who voted for him!\" Nixon carried forty-nine states to McGovern's one, for God's sake - and she wasn't kidding! That's one of the biggest problems in big-time jour nalism: its elites are hopelessly out of touch with everyday Americans. Th eir friends are liberals just as they are. They share the same values. Almost all of them think the same way on the big social issues of our time: abortion, gun control, feminism, gay rights, the environment, school prayer. After a whi le they start to believe that all civilized people think the same way they and th eir friends do. That's why they don't simply disagree with conservatives. They see them as morally deficient. What reasonable person, they wonder, could possibly be against affirmative action? Maybe some stupid people in the South and M idwest who wear polyester pants are against it. But what could you expect fro m them, anyway? The sophisticated media elites don't categorize the ir beliefs as liberal but as simply the correct way to look at things. They thin k they're middle of the road - raging moderates - while everyone else (the peopl e who live in the \"red"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"states\" that George W. Bush carried) is on the frin ge. It's scary to think that so many important people who bring Americans the ne ws can be so delusional. David Awbrey, once the editorial page editor of the Wichita Eagle in middle-America Kansas, had it right: \"With their si x-figure salaries, establishment journalists have little understanding of how hard it is to raise a family on a working-class paycheck. They are more l ikely to vacation in London or on Martha's Vineyard than in Branson or at Disne y World. And from their gilded Manhattan and Georgetown ghettoes, many of t hem look contemptuously upon such towns as Wichita, Omaha, and Des Moines as lit tle more than overgrown gopher prairies as depicted in Sinclair Lewis's Mai n Street? So I wrote the op-ed piece. In it I said, \"It's not just Democrats and some Republican presidential candidates who don't like t he flat tax - it's also a lot of big-time reporters. The flat tax rubs them the w rong way. Which is fair enough - until their bias makes its way into their reporting.\" I wrote about the liberal bias that permeates the n ational press, and I dissected Engberg's \"Reality Check\" point by point, showing how slanted it was. Then I wrote, \"One thing to remember about network news is that it steals just about everything from print. So if the New York Tim es is against the flat tax, and the Washington Post is against the flat tax, th e networks can't and won't be far behind.\" I concluded with this: '\"Reality Check' suggests th e viewers are going to get the facts. And then they can make up their mind. As Mr. Engberg might put it: 'Time out!' You'd have a better chance of getting t he facts someplace else - like Albania.\" A few hours after I faxed the op-ed to the Wall Str eet Journal, I got a call back from an editor named David Asman (now with the Fox News Channel). He told me he liked the piece and that \"We're going to run it next Tuesday.\" \"Be prepared,\" I sighed, \"to run my obituary next W ednesday.\" Mugged by \"The Dan\" It wasn't a phone call I was anxious to make, but I knew I had to. The Dan was in Iowa on February 12,1996, covering the pres-iden tial caucuses. I was at the CBS Broadcast Center in New York. I wanted to give him a heads-up, an early warning about the Wall Street Journal piece that wo uld be coming out the next morning. \"I wrote a piece for the Wall Street Journal, Dan, and my guess is you won't be ecstatic about it.\" I hadn't given him any particulars yet, so before I could go on, he assured me that it couldn't be that bad. \"Bernie,\" he told me, \"we were friends yesterday, we're friends today, and we'll be friends tomorrow. \" \"So tell me about it,\" he said, sounding mildly cur ious but not espe-cially concerned. I told him it was about a story that had run on his evening newscast a few days earlier. That it was about how the story was cynical and biased and loaded with cheap shots aimed at one of the can-did ates running for president. I also told him about how the supposedly objective ne ws story was part of an ongoing problem at the networks. When I finished with my early warning, my friend th e anchorman, who wasn't going to let some Wall Street Journal piece stand in the way of our friendship, told me, \"I'm getting viscerally angry about this.\""},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Angry, I was expecting. What came next, I wasn't. Rather's voice started quavering, and he told me ho w in his younger days he had signed up with the marines - not once, but twice! What the hell did that have to do with anything? He emphasized that this happened during \"peacetime\" - to his credit, he was trying not to sound like some kind of war hero. Rat her was famous for coming close to tears on the air when he had a patriotic s tory about Memorial Day or the Vietnam Wall or something like that. Now he was doing it with me, over the phone. Where was he going with this? I was telling him the media elites have a liberal bias, and he was telling me he was a marine who lov ed his country! And then it hit me: somehow, Dan Rather, red, white , and blue American, Texan, ex-marine-and-damn-proud-of-it, thought that if I b elieved the CBS Evening News (and the ABC and NBC news pro-grams, too) tilted le ft then I must be suggesting that it's just a short hop from being a liberal to being... an unpatriotic American! Sure it's crazy, but why else would he te ll me that he signed up with the marines, twice? I also spoke to Heyward and Engberg, dropping an ad vance copy at Heyward's office. When Heyward called me it was obvious that steam was coming out of his ears. What I had done, he told me, was \"an act of d isloyalty\" and \"a betrayal of trust.\" \"I understand how you feel,\" I told him, trying to defuse a bad situ-ation. \"But I didn't say anything in the piece about how even y ou, Andrew, have agreed with me about the liberal bias.\" Instead of calming things down, my comment made him go ballistic. ''''That would have been like raping my wife and ki dnapping my kids!\" he screamed at me. If there was an instant when I knew just how dark things would get, this was it. This one, frantic statement - Tha t would have been like raping my wife and kidnapping my kids - told me every-thin g I needed to know about the magnitude of my sin. Writing an op-ed piece was like raping his wife and kidnapping his kids. Criticizing, publicly, what I saw as bias in networ k news was like raping his wife and kidnapping his kids. This is how self-centered the media elites can be. These are people who routinely stick their noses into everybody else's b usiness. These are people who are always telling us about the media's constitutio nal right to investigate and scrutinize and a lot of times even embarrass any-on e who winds up in our crosshairs. These are people who love to take on po liticians and businessmen and lawyers and Christians and the military and athlete s and all sorts of other Americans, yet when one of their own writes an opin ion piece about American Journalism, then you've crossed the line... because taking on the media is like raping their wives and kidnapping their kids! Engberg was just as angry - but not nearly as encha nting. I called him at the CBS News Washington bureau and told him what the op -ed was about. I said it was an issue that needed to be discussed, and that sinc e no one would listen in-house, I felt I had to go public. I told him \"my intent is not to hurt you or anyone else.\" Engberg listened without saying a word. When I fini shed he said, \"Okay, Bernie, here's my response: You're full of shit.\" Then he h ung up and has never spoken"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"to me again. Dan Rather, the man who assured me \"we were friends yesterday, we're friends today, and we'll be friends tomorrow,\" hasn't spoke n a word to me, either. I could have taken out a full-page ad in the New York Times saying Dan Rather wears black stiletto do-me heels and red miniskirts behind the anchor desk, and he wouldn't have gotten as mad as when I said we ha ve a bias problem in the media. Dan Rather, the ex-marine, felt as if he had just been shot. ..by one of his own troops. In a flash, I had become Richard Nixon and Spiro Ag new and every other \"right-wing, ideological nut\" who at one time or an other tried to take Dan Rather down. Right after the WSJ piece came out, I was taken off the air, pending some decision on whether I would be fired. I sent Dan tw o letters, which I made sure were hand-delivered, explaining why I did what I di d and telling him my intent wasn't to hurt him personally but to finally get a conversation going about this bias problem. He ignored both. Many of my colleagues, the news liberals who had al ways preached openness and tolerance, stopped talking to me, fearing my radioa ctivity would rub off on them. But then, in the elegant phrase of the journa list Brian Brown, liberals these days have forgotten how to be liberal. After a quarter of a century at CBS News - half my entire life! - I had become a nonper son. The day the op-ed piece came out I got a phone call from Asa Baber, a close friend who writes the \"Men\" column in Playboy. \"I j ust read your Wall Street Journal piece,\" he said, \"and I would suggest you c all the FBI and see if they'll put you in the Witness Protection Program.\" If I had had the number handy, I would have. CBS News has always liked to think of itself as a f amily. But from where I was standing - isolated, off the air, and under fire as part of the vast right-wing conspiracy - it was looking more and more like the Manson Family. When Michelle Greppi of the New York Post interview ed Rather and asked about my op-ed piece, he told her, \"The test is not the name s people call you or accusations by political activists inside or outsid e your own organization.\" Political activist? Time to take a taxi back to Ear th, Dan. Here's what I would have asked The Dan if I had had the opportu-nity, which I did not, since he wasn't talking to me: 1. When did I sell out and become this \"political a ctivist\"? 2. What have I ever done to deserve that descriptio n? 3. How long had you known about my \"political activ ism\"? 4. How is it that you never called me a \"political activist\" before I wrote the op-ed piece?   5. Could it be that I became a \"political activist\" at preci sely the moment I pointed out this liberal bias that only you and a few others st ill deny exists? This was the strategy The Dan had settled on. Prote ct your own image by ripping your accuser. If Dan could discredit me and divert attention from what I wrote about the media elites, if he could focus attention instead on my newly discovered right-wing ideology, then - who knows? - maybe he could convince people that there really is no liberal bias in the news and that I really am a political activist, maybe even on the payroll of Je sse Helms. Anything is"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"possible. Isn't this exactly what politicians do all the time - often with great success - when they get caught doing something they shouldn't be doing? They attack their accusers. If politicians could get away with it, wh y not big-time television news stars? In the same New York Post interview Greppi told Rat her, \"Peter Jen-nings has said, to the chagrin of some people at ABC News, th at he thinks the conservative voice is sometimes not heard in network news. Berna rd Goldberg said much the same recently in the Wall Street Journal? Rather came back with one of those off-the-wall and over-the-top salvos that sound kind of funny until you realize he's not joki ng. \"I will put up billboard space on 42nd Street. I wi ll wear a sandwich board. I will do whatever is necessary to say I am not going to be cowed by anybody's special political agenda, inside, outside, upside, downside.\" So I wasn't simply a \"political activist\" as far as The Dan was con-cerned. I was a \"political activist\" with a \"political agenda .\" How in the world had I survived twenty-five years at CBS News, much of tha t time working for Dan Rather himself, if I was a political activist with a polit -ical agenda? What made Dan's rant even more transparent was that just four months earlier, when I returned to the CBS Evening News after seven years away in prime time, on 48 Hours and Eye to Eye with Connie Chung, Rather l ooked into the camera and told millions of people in his audience, \"Tonight o n the CBS Evening News we're pleased to welcome back to our broadcast veteran co rrespondent, colleague, and friend Bernard Goldberg to share his unique perspec tives on events of the day.\" How was it that I was such a pro in October of 1995 when Dan wel-comed me back to the evening news and such a bum in February of 1 996 when my WSJ piece came out? How did I go from being a featured reporter on the CBS Evening News with my own special segment - \"Bernard Goldberg's America\" - to such a right-wing scoundrel, virtu-ally overnight? When Ed Bark of the Dallas Morning News interviewed him about my column, Rather said, \"If you want to see my neck swell and the hai r on the back of my neck rise, you just try to tell me how to report the new s. When anybody tries to intimidate me into reporting the news their way, my answer is, 'Get lost.' I've never done it. I'm not going to do it now.\" Was this genuine paranoia, I wondered, or just part of the act? Now I was trying to \"intimidate\" him into covering the news my way. Why is it that when journalists write something tough about other peopl e, it's called \"news,\" but when someone writes something tough about news peop le like Dan Rather, it's called \"intimidation\"? They love diversity in the newsroom. That's what th ey say, anyway. They love diversity of color, diversity of gender, diversity of sexual ori-entation. But God forbid someone in their diverse newsroom has a diverse view about how the news ought to be presented. When that happens, thes e champions of diversity quake in their boots and practi-cally make in their pants. In fact, Andrew Heyward, the president of the news division, told the Washington Post that my op-ed column had caused \"a great deal of residual pain and suffering.\" Pain and suffering? Reporters who see m ore death and destruction than the Red Cross were in pain and suf-fering over ... my opinion? Reporters who cover plane crashes and tornadoes, an d who see dead bodies being"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"pulled from debris, these tough reporters were expe -riencing pain and suffering? When did all these rugged, no-nonsense guys become New Sensitive Men? Maybe Rather should have taken Eric Engberg and Andrew He yward into the woods so they could all bang on their drums for a few hours to ge t over their pain and suffering. When these poor guys weren't feeling their own pain , they were doing their best to inflict more on me. Bob Schieffer, the chief Washington correspondent f or CBS News, told the Washington Post, \"It's such a wacky charge, and a w eird way to go about it....I don't know what Bernie was driv ing at. It just sounds bizarre.\" Wacky? Weird? Bizarre? What I found wacky, weird, a nd bizarre was that the chief Washington CBS News correspondent found absolutely nothing wrong with Engberg's piece and was now saying that if I really thought t here was a liberal bias at CBS News, then there was only one honorable thing f or me to do: get the hell out! \"If this place is as ethically corrupt as he [Goldb erg] seems to think, I think he'd have no alternative but to resign.\" Love it or leave it was Schieffer's brilliant advice. Tom Brokaw, the NBC News anchor, joined the chorus. \"It was inap-propriate\" for me to \"go to a newspaper like the Wall Street Journ al [and] attack your own organization,\" he said on CNBC. I wondered what Brokaw would do if he found out tha t General Electric, the company that owns NBC and signs his paychecks, was rip-ping off consumers by making shoddy lightbulbs in order to rake in a few extra bucks. Would Tom think it was \"inappropriate\" to \"attack\" his own organiza tion by going public with the story? And I wondered what Tom would do if he learned that GE was making bad airplane engines? Where would his allegiance be: to his boss or to his viewers? Back in 1996, when that question crossed my mind, i t was nothing more than one of those hypothetical, what-if scenarios that I nev er expected would really happen. But it did. On January 2,2001 - five years after Tom bashed me for \"attacking\" my own organization, as he put it - the Wall Street Journa l ran a lead story on page one reporting that federal safety officials were lo oking into problems with a certain GE airplane engine. They were worried that parts of the engines might disintegrate and someday cause a major air disaster . After the story broke, GE confirmed that the WSJ go t it substantially right, adding that the company was working hard to resolve any possi-ble malfunctions on the engine, the CF6, which powers a variety of w ide-bodied airplanes, including the 747, 767, and DC-10, as well as Air F orce One and several models of the Airbus. A GE spokesman said whatever problems there were \"h appened weeks and in some cases several months ago.\" Nonetheless, GE stock dr opped nearly 9 percent in one day because of the news. Sounds like a pretty big story to me. Possible prob lems with engines attached to more than four thousand airplanes that carry thousa nds of passengers every day."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"More than a dozen newspapers picked up the story ri ght after it ran in the Wall Street Journal. And given the drop in the price of GE shares, CNBC, the cable business news channel, which is part of NBC and own ed by GE, also ran the story. So how did Tom Brokaw play it on his nightly newsca st? He didn't. He decided not to \"attack\" GE, his own organization. I understand that a journalist has to be loyal to h is own bosses, the people who sign the paychecks, but if there's a conflict, the viewer or the reader has to come first. In the long run, that's best for his ne ws organi-zation, too. That's what I thought, anyway, when I wrote the op-ed. But while newspapers all over the country were writ ing about the furor my column had caused, the New York Times, the newspaper of re cord, did not see fit to print a single word about the issue I had raised. T he world's most important newspaper, which would make room on page one for a story about the economy of Upper Volta or about the election of a lesbian dogc atcher in Azerbaijan or about affirmative action in Fiji, didn't think a story ab out media bias, leveled by a net-work news correspondent, was worth even a few p aragraphs. That, however, did not stop one of the paper's heav iest hitters, veteran political analyst R. W. \"Johnny\" Apple, from soundi ng off on television. On CNN's Reliable Sources, Apple said, \"There's no suggestion here that this man [Goldberg] went to CBS over a period of time and sa id, 'Our stuff is all one-sided, we've got to do something about this.'.. . There's no suggestion that he has done that. He has simply stabbed this guy [E ngberg] in the back.\" It's fun to watch someone as respected and thoughtf ul and pompous as Johnny Apple make a complete fool of himself. Being a wind bag is one thing, but being a windbag on a worldwide television network is a sigh t to behold. First of all, I never said, \"Our stuff is all one-s ided.\" That's not the nature of the bias problem. The problem is that bias pops up too often. On Apple's other point - that I never discussed the problem in hopes of fixing it - how did Johnny Apple know I didn't go to CBS N ews with my concerns? Did he call me to find out? No, he didn't. The fact is, I had gone to CBS News over a very long period of time; I had in fact complained about our coverage; and if Apple had bothered to ask, I would have told him. If making one phone call was too much work for John ny Apple, he could have at least read the Washington Post, which I'm sure he s ees every day since he's based in Washington himself. The Post's media write r, Howard Kurtz, reported that \"Goldberg has told friends he feels bad about hurting Engberg, but that he has complained to CBS man-agement about a liberal t ilt for several years and been consistently ignored.\" None of this mattered. The media elites were circli ng the wagons. I could have shot a Christian Fundamentalist at an anti-abortion rally in Times Square at high noon, and they would have been more sympa-thet ic than they were now that I had written about bias in the media. \"Bernie is certainly entitled to his political view s,\" Andrew Heyward told John Carmody, who at the time wrote a media gossip colum n for the Washington Post, \"and his politics have been known for a very long t ime.\" The best I can figure is that I must have been in a coma the day I turned into the Rush Limbaugh of CBS News. But there it was, th e president of CBS News telling the Washington Post that I was entitled to my \"political views\" and that my \"politics have been known for a very long time.\""},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"What exactly were these political views that I had expressed in the op-ed column? Did I come out for Steve Forbes? Did I come out for his flat tax? On both counts the answer is no. I didn't defend the f lat tax, and I didn't so much as imply that Steve Forbes might make a good presid ent. So what political views had I expressed? That the m edia elites have a liberal bias? Couldn't an honest, nonpartisan observer who cares about his own news organization come to that conclusion? I guess not - at least not as far as CBS News was concerned. Maybe I should have seen the humor in the whole thi ng. I was point-ing fingers at the media elites, which only proved to them that /was the one who had a bias problem. Wasn't this what used to happen - on a muc h scarier and devastating scale, for sure - in the old Soviet Union? A dissid ent says the elites are corrupt, so the elites throw him in the Gulag becau se his accusation proves beyond any doubt... that the dis-sident is insane. By this point, it had become painfully clear that D an Rather and the CBS News brass were not going to let bias be the issue. They were making me the issue. It didn't take much courage for Rather and his band of Lilliputians to smack me down, because I couldn't fight back - and they kne w it. If I had even tried, I have no doubt CBS would have fired me on the spot! So I didn't go to the newspapers and say, \"Does Dan Rather really think the piece about Forbes and his flat tax was fair and ob jective journalism? \"Does Dan think it's okay for one of his Washington reporters to mar-ginalize a presidential candidate and do David Letterman Top T en jokes about his biggest issue? Does that meet Dan's standard of fairness? \"Does Andrew Heyward plan more pieces that refer to the center-piece of a candidate's presidential campaign as 'wacky.'\" I couldn't say anything. I took all of Bob Schieffer's shots without ever sa ying, \"What's wacky, weird, and bizarre is that Bob Schieffer, who ought to kno w better, is deaf, dumb, and blind when it comes to spotting an editorial passin g itself off as straight news.\" But I knew that I had gotten myself into this mess - not by express-ing an opinion that Rather and the others would hate - but by putting my name on the opinion. I could have gone to a dozen newspaper rep orters who write about television and suggested they get a tape of the Eng berg piece, and then blast it - \"off the record.\" I could have said all the things I said in the Wall Street Journal co lumn and a lot more, without using my name. Guys like Rather, Schieffer, and Heyward operate th at way all the time. When Dan wanted to get rid of his evening news coan chor, Connie Chung, because he felt she was getting uppity by demanding more ai r-time, he and his friends ripped her to shreds in the press - but you rarely saw his name attached to the story. When the CBS Evening News sent Connie to Oklahoma C ity on April 19, 1995 - before they sent Dan in, who was on vacation - to a nchor one of the biggest stories of our time, the bombing of the Alfred P. M urrah Federal Building and the death of 168 innocent people, Dan was so incens ed that Connie was on the air first and getting all the airtime that when he fina lly arrived in Oklahoma City, he spent hours and hours on the phone with TV write rs, blasting Connie Chung as"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"a second-rate journalist. Several CBS news people heard him do it. \"Dan was b ehind a cur-tain [in the makeshift CBS newsroom at the CBS affiliate in Okla homa City] ripping her,\" one of them told me. \"He was on the phone for hours bla sting her.\" Of course, he wasn't speaking \"on the record,\" so you couldn't fi nd his name in any of the stories. Just one month later, when Connie was dump ed from CBS News, Dan did go on the record and was quoted by name, in the Boston Globe Magazine, saying of his former coanchor: \"I'm a friend of hers. I was y esterday, I am today, and I will be tomorrow.\" Boy, did that sound familiar. This was Dan speaking pure Dan-ish. \"I'm a friend o f hers\" means \"I am not a friend of hers.\" \"I was [her friend] yesterday, I a m today, and I will be tomorrow\" means \"I'm glad they finally fired her so I can have more airtime for myself.\" This is the ugly, take-no-prisoners side of Dan tha t comes out when he feels threatened. It's as if he doesn't understand how bi g and important he has become over the years, how far he's traveled from the smal l-town, blue-collar, Depression-era Texas of his childhood. It's as if h e doesn't know that he can afford to be generous. One hundred sixty-eight human beings, including nin eteen children, are blown to smithereens and Dan - anonymously - is miffed becau se Connie Chung is getting more airtime than he is! But Dan left no fin-gerpri nts. At least I had the guts to attach my name to what I believed. And I thought it was amusing, in a perverse kind of way, that the president of CBS News, Andrew Heyward, never said that the charg e of liberal bias at CBS News and the other networks was a pathetic fab-rication of my supposed right-wing imagination and was utterly ludi-crous and without merit. There was a reason for this. While Andrew was shout ing to the Wash-ington Post that my \"politics had been known for a very long ti me,\" he was whispering something quite different, privately. \"The Emperor Is Naked\" When the magazine show Eye to Eye with Connie Chung first started up in 1993,I went to Heyward, who was then the show's executive producer, with an idea. \"Let's do a piece about whether there really is a l iberal bias in television news,\" I said in his office on West 57th Street in Manhattan. I told Heyward I would put in requests to interview Rather and Brokaw and Jennings. I'd put responsible critics on, too. Peop le who believed there was a leftward tilt to the news. The report I envisioned would be fair and balanced, just the way the news was supposed to be at CBS. Si nce this was the one topic that pretty much had been out of bounds on network news, I thought it might create a buzz and spark some interest in our new ma gazine show. If Heyward were hooked up to a machine that measure d his enthu-siasm level, the needle wouldn't have budged. If, on the other hand, I had suggested a story about serial killers who murder prostitutes or litt le girls who kill their baby-sisters - stories Heyward actually put on Eye to Eye - the needle would have been dancing all over the place. But a story a bout bias in the news? A story that might offend The Dan? Heyward probably t hought I was high on drugs to even mention it. But I persisted, telling Andrew that we do stories about everything else, about"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"every other institution in America; why not a story about ourselves? He gave an inch. Heyward said he would talk to Eric Ober, then the president of CBS News, and see what he thought. A few days later Heyward came back with the answer. Ober wasn't enthusiastic either. But, he said, there might be a middle groun d. I could do the story, he said, \"but you can't ask Dan any tough ques-tions.\" At first I thought he was kidding. You can't ask Dan any tough questions? Hey ward has a dry sense of humor. When has an executive producer or a news pre sident ever said a reporter can't ask somebody tough questions? A reporter woul d be in hot water if he or she didn't ask tough questions on a controversial i ssue. Can you imagine if I said I wanted to do a profile of Rush Limbaugh and Heyward said, \"Okay, but you can't ask Rush any tough quest ions\"? Or Newt Gingrich. \"Sure, Bernie, you can do a piece , but make sure you don't ask him any tough questions.\" \"You have got to be kidding,\" I said to Heyward. \"Y ou can't possibly be serious!\" Heyward said he was not kidding and that he was serious. Now it was my turn to say I didn't want any part of this story. Not with these ridiculous restrictions. Dan was not the bad guy. N ot directly anyway. Heyward and Ober never asked how he'd feel about such a sto ry. They just knew. Everyone is afraid of crossing The Dan, who, Sicili an style, divides the world into friends and enemies. And you don't want to be caught on the wrong side of the line. Ober and Heyward and a lot of others put Rather's concerns - or their notion of his concerns - before the con-cerns of th eir viewers, who, I still think, would have respected us more, not less, for doing a tough, honest story about ourselves. Rather's baby-sitters were coddling him as if he we re Ted Baxter, a smiling fool who didn't know enough about his own business to an swer a few tough questions. This was unfair to Dan, who speaks reasonably and a rticulately all the time about the news business. Couldn't he make a case th at the bias charges were bogus? His handlers weren't about to find out by pu tting Dan Rather in the very same hot seat he had put so many people in during h is career. They felt they had to protect him from \"tough questions.\" They had to protect CBS News, and the other networks, too, from - what? - a ten-minute ma gazine story that would raise the question: Is there a liberal bias in network te levision news? What were they so afraid of? There was one other thing Andrew Heyward told me, f ace to face, in his Eye to Eye office. It was something that would haunt me a few years later when I was twisting in the wind for writing my op-ed column. \"Look, Bernie,\" he said, \"of course there's a liber al bias in the news. All the networks tilt left.\" He said it in such a way as to indicate, \"Come on, we all know it - the whole damn world knows it - but that doesn't mean we have to put it on the air!\" And Heyward said one other thing I will always reme mber: \"If you repeat any of this, I'll deny it.\" Three years after that conversation in Andrew's off ice, in February of 1996 when my op-ed piece came out, Heyward was still trying t o balance what he knew privately to be true with what he felt he could say publicly. There were other considerations, practical issues that had to be tak en into account. If he had acknowledged that I might be onto something - even if my decision to go public"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"was something he deplored - Heyward would have his hands full with Rather and Schieffer and Engberg and a lot of others at CBS Ne ws. So Heyward told the Washington Post: \"Was he [Goldb erg] acting on principle? Yes. Was he a misguided missile? Yes.\" He knew I wa sn't trying to hurt anyone. He knew, from hundreds of conversations over many y ears, how much I cared about journalism at CBS News. Publicly, Heyward said that what I had done was \"a real hand grenade thrown among his colleagues,\" that it was \"a real breach o f our fundamental trust.\" But privately the president of CBS News was saying something else altogether. Privately, he told me the Engberg piece represented \"a con-spiracy of fuck-ups,\" because no one had stopped it before it got on the air. What he didn't say, not explicitly anyway, was that they let it on the air precisely because they didn't see anything wrong with it. Andrew knew the Engberg piece was indefensible, but he would never say so publicly. If he had, I wouldn't have been so alone and isolated. In the halls at CBS News New York the day the op-ed came out, many colleagues shunned me. They averted their eyes as if I had som e kind of fatal disease. Al Ortiz, then the Washington bureau chief and Engberg 's immediate boss, called and, in a very polite and gentlemanly way, asked, \" What in the world were you thinking when you wrote that piece?\" What in the world was I thinking? Did you ever wond er, Al, even for one damn second, what in the world your own correspondent, E ric Engberg, was thinking? Did you wonder what in the world your producers in Washington were thinking when they edited the piece and sent it on to New York? I thought it, but didn't say it, because there was no point in making even more enemies than I already had. So I told Ortiz that I meant no personal harm to Engberg or Rather or anyone else. My intent was to get a discussion going, because, until now, no one took my complaints about bias seriously. Then I asked Ortiz a question: \"What did you think of Engberg's piece?\" Ortiz said he \"winced\" when Engberg referred to Forbes's \"Number One Wackiest Flat-Tax Promise.\" The Washington bureau manager \"winced.\" A nd then he did absolutely nothing. While the heat was being turned up inside the Broad cast Center in New York, something quite different was happening on the outs ide. It's as if there were two Americas, or at least two American cultures: th e media-elite America, which was shunning me, and the other America - the one b etween Manhattan and Malibu - which was thanking and con-gratulating me for sayin g publicly what they had been thinking for years. Over the next few weeks I received hundreds of lett ers (some of which are reproduced in Appendix B) and phone calls, a few fr om fel-low journalists, but the overwhelming majority from regular Americans wh ose only contact with the big-time media is when they turn on their TV sets t o watch the evening news. It was these people who helped me understand that no m atter how I was being treated inside CBS News, no matter how alien my views were in-house, outside I had many sup-porters who were actually grateful for what I h ad written. I heard from a man named Joseph Doyle, of Waynesbor o, Penn-sylvania, who wrote: \"I wish to join with so many other Americans in tha nking you for raising such a very important issue. I find it incredible that And rew Heyward, CBS News Division President, chooses to treat you as the iss ue rather than the liberal"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"bias of the media elites.\" Herbert Russell of Carbondale, Illinois, wrote: \"Li beral bias among the television networks has done something that market forces could not have engendered, the revitalization of radio. Rush Limba ugh would never have become the success he has if the firm of Rather, Brokaw, a nd Jennings had done its job. Instead, they failed.\" Jan McDonough of Fort Worth, Texas, wrote: \"Those o f us outside the media have been aware for years of the liberal bias that is so perva-sive. That's why the 'alternative' media audience has grown and the so-c alled 'mainstream' media audience is shrinking.\" Richard Asper, from Watertown, South Dakota, notice d that CBS News had taken me off the air. So he sent me a letter that asked: \"Wh ere are you? Since you wrote that op-ed piece for the Wall Street Journal exposi ng the media's liberal bias, it's like you disappeared. Never fear, I have an id ea!\" His idea was to include in his letter a drawing of a milk carton, with a space right in the middle for my picture. Beneath the mil k carton, he had written: \"Have you seen this man? \"Name: Bernard Goldberg. \"Subject has been missing since he told the truth a bout the media's liberal bias. \"We fear the worst.\" I also heard from a few brave souls in the media. J ohn Stossel, the iconoclastic ABC News correspondent, called from an airplane to say he thought the op-ed piece was \"right on the money.\" An especially courageous producer at 60 Minutes, wh ose name I won't mention to protect her from possible repercussions, left a voi ce mail saying, \"I agree with your premise and am proud to tell anybody that I do .\" She also said the op-ed piece was \"being hotly discussed in the halls here [at 60 Minutes} and I must tell you that [there are] those in management who w on't go on the record but agree with your prem-ise as well. Hang in there.\" A news director at a television station CBS owns (I won't use his name, either) wrote to say, \"I can't figure out people who claim to love journalism but when someone comes along and points out something that n eeds attention, they can't handle it.\" Roger Ailes of Fox News called with an especially e legant message: \"You got balls, Goldberg.\" Dick Wolf, the executive producer of the NBC show L aw & Order, left a voice mail that said: \"That was a hell of a piece in the Wall Street Journal. I agree with every single comma and semicolon in it. You were on e thousand percent on the money. It was great to say that 'Yes indeed, the Em peror is naked.'\" Bob Costas, the NBC and HBO star who is one of the most thought-ful people in all of television, and who is a friend, left a mess age saying, \"My guess is this [answering] machine is filled to the point of near explosion....Buck up, if in fact you need bucking up, because what you did, ess entially, is just in keeping with who you want to be and who you should be.\" Peter Boyer - former media writer at the New York, Times and the New Yorker and author of Who Killed CBS - sent me a heartwarming l et-ter that said, in part, \"I cannot guess what interior politics preceded it, an d shudder to imagine what followed, but your WSJ column today was one righteo us piece of commentary.... If"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"I may presume to say so, CBS News should be proud.\" Then I opened an interoffice envelope and on bright yellow paper was a short note from a CBS News colleague. \"In the future, if you have any derogatory remarks to make about CBS News or one of your co-workers....I hope you'll do the same thi ng again.\" It was signed, \"Regards, Andy Rooney.\" Identity Politics 4 I grew up in a blue-collar, Democratic family in th e South Bronx. We lived in a tenement that was old even back then. My father, Sa m, worked long hours at a factory where they put embroidery on fabrics, every thing from tablecloths to dresses. My mother, Sylvia, took care of things at home, mostly my two broth-ers and me. My elementary school, P.S. 61, was on Charlotte Str eet, an old, run-down couple of blocks that (long after I was gone) caught the a ttention of both Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan. Both had traipsed through the ne ighborhood, camera crews in tow, because, by the time they dis-covered it, Char lotte Street was widely seen as one of the most rundown slums in all of America, a national symbol of urban decay. My parents had to cash in a small insurance policy to get me started in college, another public school, Rutgers University in New Br unswick, New Jersey. At Rutgers, like most of us on campus in the 1960s, I was liberal on all the big issues. I was an especially big fan of Lyndon Johns on's Great Society. 'I thought then, and still do today, that Martin Lu ther King is one of the two or three greatest and most courageous Americans of the twen-tieth century. I didn't vote for Reagan either time. But I did vot e for McGovern - twice. Once in the Florida primary and again in the 1972 genera l election. I'm pro-choice, with reservations, especially when it comes to minors. And I'm for gay rights, too. Not exactly the credentials of some raging right-wi nger or even some country-club Republican. By way of full disclosure, I admit I had a flirtati on with conservatism in my younger days. When I was a little kid growing up in the Bronx in the 1950s, I was a die-hard Yankee fan, but I swear that's the c losest I've ever come to openly supporting the military-industrial complex o r any-thing so blatantly right-wing! I know they used to say that rooting for the Yankee s was like rooting for General Motors, but that doesn't necessarily make m e a Republican, does it? Ira Glasser, the card-carrying, former executive direct or of the American Civil Liberties Union, once wrote that \"it was the Yankee fans who grew up to believe in oil depletion allowances.\" Hey, I was seven year s old! The only allowance I cared about was the twenty-five cents a week my par ents gave me. Nonetheless, I do admit that on more than one occasion I did in fa ct sit in the bleachers at Yankee Stadium, eating hot dogs and drinking Cokes, and generally living it up with all those other rotten capitalists. Sue me! These days, like most Americans, I'm still against racial discrimina-tion. I'd even make it a criminal offense, not just civil. Bu t I'm against it even when its targets are white people. So while I'm for what we like to call affirmative"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"action when that means reaching out to bring more m inorities into the process, I'm against affirmative action when it means racial preferences, which in the real world is what affirmative action is usually ab out. Why should the children of Jesse Jackson or Colin Powell or Diana Ross get some kind of racial preference when they apply to col-lege or go out fo r a job, but no \"affirmative action\" is given to the child of a white Anglo-Saxo n Protestant coal miner from West Virginia? I'm also against affirmative action for \"legacies\" - kids, almost always white, who get accepted by a college because mommy or dadd y went there twenty-five years earlier. I'm also 100 percent against sex discrimination, ju st as I was when the modern women's movement began in the 1960s and early 1970s . But these days I see an awful lot of sexism masquerading as feminism. Which means I'm against sex discrimination even when it's aimed at men, whether it's called affirmative action or anything else. I also think there's too much male bashing in our c ulture - too many TV shows that demean men in general and fathers in particula r and too many professional feminists who see men as dumb jerks who \"just don't get it.\" I think welfare is absolutely necessary for some pe ople, but I also think it's wrecked the lives of far too many Americans who hav e gotten hooked on it. If all that makes me a neoconservative, fine. But I see myself as an old-fashioned liberal. I'm a liberal the way libera ls used to be. My views these days are fairly mainstream in our co untry. But not in America's newsrooms. Which helps explain why, after I wrote t he WSJ column, Dan started suggesting I was a \"political activist\" with a \"spe -cial political agenda.\" I started working at the Associated Press in New Yo rk City four days after I graduated from Rutgers in 1967.I was earning the pr incely sum of $102.50 a week, and I never spent a second thinking about media bia s. In 1969 I moved to Miami to work at WTVJ, then the local CBS television affi liate. That's about the time that Vice President Agnew started giving alliterati on a bad name. Members of the national press were a bunch of \"nattering nabobs of negativism,\" because of the grief they were giving Nixon over the war in Vietna m. The words may have come from William Safire's typewriter, but the enthusias m and zest were Agnew's. I guess I thought about what Agnew was saying - for about a second - before I dismissed it. I didn't take Spiro Agnew seriously. (And neither, apparently, did Richard Nixon. John Ehrlichman, one of Nixon's pala ce guards, wrote in his memoir, Witness to Power, that the president used t o joke that \"No assassin in his right mind would kill me. They know if they did that they would wind up with Agnew!\") In 1972, CBS News hired me and assigned me to the n etwork news bureau in Atlanta. I was still in high school and college at the heigh t of the 1960s civil rights story, but I managed to cover the 1970s version in the South. I witnessed things up close I had only seen on television before. To this day, I can see the Atlanta police on their horses, swinging batons at black civil rights demonstrators whose one and only crime was that they had no formal permit to march. The demonstration had start ed late one afternoon on Auburn Street, at the Ebenezer Baptist Church, wher e Martin Luther King Jr. and his father had preached, and was heading for downto wn Atlanta about a mile away."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":" My camera crew and I were walking with the demonstr ators. Everything was peaceful and then, in the blink of an eye, the poli ce came out of nowhere. They had been hiding a few blocks ahead, behind some bui ldings. The marchers kept moving downtown, and the police came riding up, rig ht at them. When the marchers wouldn't stop, the police, most of them white, rode in circles around the demonstra-tors, almost all of them black, swinging their nightsticks at anyone who got in the way. That leaves an impression on a young reporter, espe cially one who grew up liberal in the North. I covered George Wallace before and after he was sh ot. I worked with good-ol'-boy camera crews who liked the message Wal lace was sending to America. I got into more than a few verbal brawls with them over how in the world they could admire this man who once promised \"segregatio n today, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever\" during one of his ca mpaigns for governor of Alabama. During the oil boycott of the early 1970s, I met a truly vile man named J. B. Stoner, a bigot of world-class proportions, who yea rs later would be convicted of dynamiting a black church in Birmingham, Alabama . I found Stoner's name in the diary of the man who h ad kidnapped an Atlanta newspaper editor named Reg Murphy. This came not lo ng after Patricia Hearst was kidnapped in California. So it was a pretty big sto ry. I went to Stoner's house in Marietta, Georgia, to s ee what he might have to say. But my camera crew and I couldn't get to the front door, which was being protected by a pacing, barking, worked-up German sh epherd behind a fence. When Stoner came out, my cameraman, John Smith, a southe rner born and bred, had the good sense to do the talking. \"Mr. Stoner,\" he said, thickening up the accent jus t a tad to smooth the way, \"my name is John Smith. I'm with CBS News. And this is Leroy Rollins, my sound man.\" Leroy was another good ol' white boy from the Deep South, who, like Smith, shook Stoner's hand. \"And Mr. Stoner,\" Smith went o n, \"this is Bernie...\" - and at this point, Smith moved his hand across his mout h so that J. B. Stoner could not make out my last name. Smith was a genius! Why offend this racist piece of garbage by let-ting him know there was a Goldberg on his property. \"This is Bern ie mumble mumble mumble...\" Brilliant! After we talked outside in his yard for a while, pr etty much getting nowhere on the kidnap story, Stoner went back in to get a litt le memento he thought we might like. It was a bumper sticker that represente d Stoner's philosophy on the oil crisis. He brought three of them out, one for e ach of his new buddies. The slogan was: \"Oil Yes - Jews No.\" There was real bias in our culture back then, but I can't remember seeing bias in the news. I was in my twenties, and these were s ome of the new experiences that were shaping my life. I loved the idea that my stories were on a newscast anchored by the most trusted man in America, Walter Cronkite. Maybe I was too busy running all over the place covering tornadoes and train wrecks and southern pols and civil rights demonstrations, but media bia s was not on my radar screen. I don't remember talking about it or thinking about it except when Nixon and Agnew brought it up, and then, as I say, given thei r not-so-hidden agenda, I"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"dismissed it. The 1980s, however, were a completely different sto ry. These were the Reagan Years. His campaign ads said it was \"Morning in America,\" which was a Madison Avenue way of conjuring up imag es of something fresh and tranquil settling over the landscape. This would no t be the turbulent and psychedelic 1960s or the dark and gloomy 1970s. The 1980s, the Reagan Years, would be when we returned to Norman Rockwell's Amer ica. Ronald Reagan said all the things the majority of A mericans wanted to hear. That we pay too much taxes. That the Soviet Union was an Evil Empire. That it was time to restore traditional Family Values to Americ a. , Liberals were gagging from sea to shining sea. There was one thing Reagan did not talk about - the disease that had just begun ravaging gays from San Francisco to New York. AIDS. To the Liberal Establishment, Ronald Reagan was a N eanderthal. He was old, he wasn't hip, and, worst of all, they saw him as stup id, \"an amiable dunce,\" to use the put-down of choice. To the Left, Reagan was no more than a two-bit acto r who was merely reading the words that the smarter and scarier right-wingers ha d put in front of him. Liberals saw him as an insensitive old man who woul d rather spend money on missiles than on new schoolhouses. To feminists on the Left, he was the symbol of the oppressive white male power structure. To gays, he was the reason AIDS was spreading. To blacks, he was the president who ridiculed \"welf are queens.\" There was something in the Reagan Revolution for ev ery liberal to hate. (In fairness, years later, some liberals in the med ia changed their minds about Reagan, no longer portraying him as a simpleton. On September 9, 1999, for instance, Newsweek’s assistant managing editor Evan Thomas - whose grandfather Norman ran for president of the United States six t imes as a socialist - generously offered up this appraisal of the former president, on a nationally syndicated TV talk show called Inside Washington: \" He had kind of an intuitive idiot genius,\" Thomas said, referring to Mr. Reagan 's contribution to bring-ing down the Soviet empire. To some media elites, like Evan Thomas, who went to Andover and Harvard, Ronald Reagan had evolved all the way from a plain old simple idiot... to an idiot genius. How nice.) It was in this atmosphere that liberals felt as if they were on the out-side looking in, which they were. They felt as if they w ere under siege. And they became very sensitive to every slight, real or imag ined. Political correctness started to take hold. Jokes a bout how many fem-inists it took to change a lightbulb weren't funny, damn it! Any sugges-tion from straight Americans that gays might actually be fueling the A IDS epidemic with reckless behavior, by refusing, for instance, to shut down b athhouses that celebrated gay, anonymous, orgy-like sex, was seen as homophob ia. Anyone who argued against affirmative action ran the risk of being called a r acist. America was becoming balkanized. E Pluribus Unum - From Many, One - was being turned on its head. And the national news media, print and TV, were not just covering this important trend in American culture. They were taking sides. In 1981, having worked out of CBS News bureaus in A tlanta and then San"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Francisco, I was named a national correspondent, wh ich allowed me to cover bigger, more important stories anywhere in the coun try. My new base was CBS News headquarters in New York, where I was assigned to t he evening news and its brand-new anchor, Dan Rather, who had just replaced Walter Cronkite. It was in New York that for the first time I starte d noticing things that made me feel uneasy. I noticed that we pointedly identified conservative s as conservatives, for example, but for some crazy reason didn't bother to identify liberals as liberals. Harry Smith, the cohost (at the time) of CBS This M orning, intro-duced a segment on sexual harassment saying: \"... has anything real ly changed? Just ahead we're going to ask noted law professor Catharine MacKinno n and conservative spokeswoman Phyllis Schlafly to talk about that.\" It sounds innocent enough, but why is it that Phyll is Schlafly was identified as a conservative, but Catharine MacKinnon was not ide nti-fied as a radical feminist or a far-left law professor or even as a p lain old liberal? MacKinnon, after all, is at least as far to the left as Schlaf ly is to the right. Why was she simply a \"noted law professor\"? The clear impli cation was that Catharine MacKinnon is an objective, well-respected observer and Phyllis Schlafly is a political partisan. In fact, during the Clarence Thomas-Anita Hill hear ings, NBC News actually brought MacKinnon in as an \"expert\" to bring perspe c-tive to the hearings. MacKinnon is the feminist ideologue who had famousl y implied that all sexual intercourse is rape. This did not deter NBC News. This blindness, this failure to see liberals as any thing but middle-of-the-road moderates, happens all the time on network televisi on. The Christian Coalition is identified as a conservative organization - so f ar, so good - but we don't identify the National Organization for Women (NOW) as a liberal organization, which it surely is. Robert Bork is the \"conservative\" judge. But Lauren ce Tribe, who must have been on the CBS Evening News ten million times in the 19 80s (and who during the contested presidential election in 2000 was a leadi ng member of Team Gore, arguing the vice president's case before the U.S. S upreme Court), is identified simply as a \"Harvard law professor.\" But Tribe is n ot simply a Harvard law professor. He's easily as liberal as Bork is conser vative. If we do a Hollywood story, it's not unusual to ide ntify certain actors, like Tom Selleck or Bruce Willis, as conservatives. But Barbra Streisand or Rob Reiner, no matter how active they are in liberal De mocratic pol-itics, are just Barbra Streisand and Rob Reiner. Rush Limbaugh is the conservative radio talk show h ost. But Rosie O'Donnell, who while hosting a fund-raiser for Hillary Clinton sai d Mayor Rudy Giuliani was New York's \"village idiot,\" is not the liberal TV talk show host. During the Clinton impeachment trial in 1999, as th e senators signed their names in the oath book swearing they would be fair and im partial, Peter Jennings, who was anchoring ABC News's live cover-age, made sure his audience knew which senators were conservative - but uttered not a wor d about which ones were liberal. As the senators each signed the oath book, Jennings identified sev-eral Democrats, including Barbara Boxer and Ted Kennedy, two of the most liberal"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"members of the Senate, without ever mentioning that they are indeed liberal. That would have been just fine, except for what hap pened later. When Senator John McCain signed the book, Jennings said, \"Senato r John McCain here of Arizona, left-hander. More right than left in his p olitics and intending to run for president of the United States.\" Jennings spotted another conservative. \"Senator McC onnell of Kentucky, very determined conservative member of the Republican Pa rty.\" When Jennings identified the next senator to sign t he book it was, \"Senator Mikulski of Maryland.\" Plain and simple. Unadorned. Senator Mikulski of Ma ryland. Not a word that Senator Mikulski is a liberal Democrat from Marylan d. ; Then, a few seconds later, Jennings, with pinpoint precision, contin-ue d identifying the conservatives. \"Senator Rick Santorum, one of the y ounger members of the Senate, Republican, very determined conser-vative member of the Senate. That's Senator Daschle there in the left-hand side of your picture .\" Santorum was a conservative Republican but Tom Dasc hle, a liberal from South Dakota, was simply... Senator Daschle. Charles Schumer, the newly elected liberal senator from New York, was \"Senator Schumer\"... no label needed. But the next senator t o sign the oath book was \"Mr. Smith of New Hampshire, also another very, very con servative Republican intending to run for the presidency.\" When Paul Wellstone of Minnesota and Ron Wyden of O regon came up to sign - two more from the left wing of the Democratic Party - Jennings simply identified them by name and state. The word liberal never pass ed through Peter's lips. In fact, Peter felt no need to identify any of the Dem ocratic liberals in the Senate. Not a single one. Only the conservative Rep ublicans. There's a better chance that Peter Jennings, the co ol, sophisticated Canadian, would identify Mother Teresa as \"the old broad who used to work in India\" than there is that he would call a liberal Democrat ...a liberal Democrat! On that particular day, Peter identified the conser vatives because he thought it mattered. He thought his viewers needed to know. An d he was right. He didn't identify the liberals, obviously because he thought it didn't matter. And he was wrong. In the world of the Jenningses and Brokaws and Rath ers, conserva-tives are out of the mainstream and need to be identified. Libera ls, on the other hand, are the mainstream and don't need to be identified. I found out just how true that was during my last c onversation with Dan, the one on the phone the day before the op-ed came out. Tha t I would write such treasonous material was bad enough in Dan's eyes, b ut that I picked the Wall Street Journal - such a conservative paper - annoy ed him too, and he let me know it. \"What do you call the New York Times editorial page ?\" I asked him, since he had written op-eds for that paper. \"Middle of the road,\" he said without missing a bea t. \"You don't think the New York Times has a liberal e ditorial page?\" I asked him, not believing what I had just heard. \"No,\" he said, \"middle of the road.\" This is a newspaper that consistently editorializes in favor of affir-mative action, of all sorts of abortion rights, of strict gun-control laws, and is"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"against the death penalty. The editorials are well written and well reasoned. But they do represent liberal points of view. This is a newspaper that has endorsed for president Al Gore, Bill Clinton twice, Michael Dukakis, Walter Mondale, Jimmy Carter twice , George McGovern, Hubert Humphrey, Lyndon Johnson, and John Kennedy. You wou ld have to go back to Dwight Eisenhower to find the last time the New York Times came out in favor of anyone even vaguely resembling a conservative. And Dan Rather calls its editorial page \"middle of the road.\" This is the essence of the problem. To Dan Rather a nd to a lot of other powerful members of the chattering class, that which is righ t of center is conservative. That which is left of center is middle of the road. No wonder they can't recognize their own bias. Why is it that the word \"left-wing\" has virtually v anished from the media's vocabulary? \"Right-wing,\" on the other hand, is doi ng quite well, thank you. We have right-wing Republicans and right-wing Christia ns and light-wing Miami Cubans and right-wing radio talk show hosts. Isn't anybody left-wing anymore? Aren't there any left-wing Christians? Aren't Jesse Jackson and Senator Barbara Boxer and Congressman Barney Frank way out there on the left wing of the Democratic Party? Why is it that just about the onl y time you hear the term \"left-wing\" on a network evening newscast is when t he anchors and reporters are talking about the part of an air-plane that caught fire right before the crash? Conservatives think this is proof that there's a da rk conspiracy among the liberal media elites. They're wrong. I have never h eard a sin-gle reporter or producer or anchor or executive say anything like: Let's leave off the liberal label so we can make so-and-so appear high-minded a nd objective. And while we're at it, let's make sure we identify the other side a s conservative so our viewers will know he or she is a partisan with a right-wing ideological ax to grind. It never happens that way. Never. Not even with a w ink and a nod. If it did, we'd be a lot better off. Because that is fixable. That is blatant bias that cannot and would not be tolerated. What happens in reality is far worse. The reason we don't identify NOW as a liberal group or Laurence Tribe as a liberal professor or Tom Daschle as a liberal Democ rat is that, by and large, the media elites don't see them that way. It may be hard to believe, but liberals in the newsroom, pretty much, see NOW and Tribe and even left-wing Democrats as middle of the road. Not coincidentally , just as they see themselves. When you get right down to it, liberals in the newsroom see liberal views as just plain... reasonable. No need to identify Patricia Ireland as head of a l iberal women's group, because to the media elites her views are not leftist. They simply make sense. They're simply reasonable. After all, she's for abortion ri ghts without restrictions, isn't she? She's for affirmative action, isn't she? To mainstream America, these are major elements of the liberal agenda. But to the liberals in the media, these aren't liberal vie ws at all. They’re just sensible, reasonable, rational views, which just ha ppen to coincide with their own. I once asked Susan Zirinksy, a first-rate journalis t who had been the CBS Evening News senior producer in Washington (she's n ow execu-tive producer of 48 Hours), how many times she went to conservative wom en's groups for on-camera"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"reactions either to Supreme Court deci-sions or to votes in Congress regarding women's issues. She thought about it for a few seco nds, then told me she couldn't think of a single time. In retrospect, eve n she found that odd. I say \"in retrospect\" because at the time, she neve r gave it a second thought. Need a reaction? Go to NOW. What other group would you go to? Certainly not some \"fringe\" group that opposed abortion rights or affi rmative action. This is the kind of party-line thinking that prompt ed Michael Barone, the conservative Washington journalist, to say that the press is \"one of America's most pro-feminist institutions.\" But Zirinksy, who is an honest newswoman, never tho ught of it that way. She didn't act out of malice. She didn't conspire with anyone to freeze out conservative women. She just thought NOW was the lo gical place to go. NOW was the group that spoke for women. NOW wasn't a libera l group, to Zirinsky. It was a sensible, reasonable, and rational group. Since conservative women like Phyllis Schlafly or c onservative judges like Robert Bork have \"unorthodox\" views, illiberal view s, we must make sure to identify them as conservatives so our audience won' t think that they're objective - or worse, heaven forfend, that they'r e also sensi-ble, reasonable, and rational. If you hooked network news reporters and producers to polygraph machines and asked them, \"Do you think you are guilty of liberal bias?\" most would almost certainly answer, \"No.\" And they would pass the pol ygraph test because they're not lying. They honestly believe what they're sayin g. And that's the biggest problem of all. How Bill Clinton Cured Homelessness In the 1980s, I started noticing that the homeless people we showed on the news didn't look very much like the homeless people I wa s tripping over on the sidewalk. The ones on the sidewalk, by and large, w ere winos or drug addicts or schizophrenics. They mumbled crazy things or gave y ou the evil eye when they put paper coffee cups in your face and \"asked\" for mone y. Or they had drool coming down the side of their mouths and lived in cardboar d boxes... but only until the spaceship came back to take them home to Planet Neu tron. But the ones we liked to show on television were di fferent. They looked as if they came from your neighborhood and mine. They loo ked like us. And the message from TV news was that they didn't just look like us - they were like us! On NBC, Tom Brokaw said that the home-less are \"people you know.\" I'm sure Tom was right, even though, for some crazy reason, I per-sonally didn't know any homeless people. Unless, of course, you co unt all those car-window washers on the street who, hoping for a buck or two , used to spit on my windshield at red lights because they ran out of Wi ndex twenty years ago. But many of the homeless that Tom and Dan and Peter showed on the nightly news were sympathetic souls who told stories about how, because of hard times, they were temporarily down on their luck. They reminded us of Tom Joad and his proud family in The Grapes of Wrath, who were brought dow n by the Depression. And I'm as guilty as the next reporter. Before I started sh owing the real homeless on the evening news, I made my bosses very happy by go ing to a soup kitchen in New York where I found a very atypical, blond-haired, b lue-eyed family - husband, wife, kids... all that was missing was a dog named Rover - and put them on"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"national television as the faces of homelessness in America. It was the only story like that I did; nonetheless, mea culpa. They could have been any of us, the down-and-outers we showed. And that's exactly why they were on television so much, even t hough they made up only a tiny fraction of the homeless in America. In a word , we put them on TV for the reason television people do almost every-thing - ra tings. Ratings are the God that network executives and their acolytes worship. We know who our viewers are. We know what they look like. And we know that they would be drawn more to stories about homeless peopl e who looked just like their mothers and fathers and sons and daughters than hom eless people who looked like, well, homeless people. But there was another, more insidious reason we foc used on those people who looked like our next-door neighbors. If we journali sts could win sympathy for them, then we had a chance of winning sympa-thy for the less sympathetic homeless, which might translate into a new homeless shelter - in some nonjournalist's neighborhood, of course. But to do that we first needed to go to central cas ting and get just the right kind of homeless people on the news. White was better than black. Clean was better than dirty. Attractive was better than unattractive. Sane was better than insane. And sober was better than addicted. So when the TV people went looking for ju st that right kind of homeless face to put on their news programs, they w ent to people like Robert Hayes, who ran the National Coalition for the Homel ess in New York. In 1989, Hayes told the New York Times that when co ngressional committees and TV news producers contact him, \"they always want white , middle-class people to interview.\" Walter Goodman, who writes about television for the New York Times, came up with a name for what we in the media were doing. He call ed it the \"prettifying of reality.\" More often than not, a news story or documentary on the homeless will feature a hard-working, straight-living young couple or an at tractive teen-ager and her child who have run into a spell of bad luck. The reasons for the choices are not obscure. If you want to arouse sympathy for the homeless, you do not put forward off-putting sp ecimens. Television news producers can count on advocacy groups to supply th em with model victims for view-ing purposes, people who may even be untouched by the other afflictions discovered in... [a] survey of the homeless: mental illness, AIDS, domestic violence, and lack of education and skills. And why should a producer focus on one of the 50 percent of single homeless people who have served time in jail when he can just as easily find someone without a r ecord? Whether the intention is to make a more moving show or build support for programs to help the homeless and possibly reassure viewers about having a small shelter in their neigh-borhood, the result is a prettifying of reali ty. But it wasn't enough simply to prettify reality. We also had to exag-gerate reality if we were really going to gain support and compassion for the homeless. No one knows exactly how many homeless there were i n America in the 1980s and early 1990s, but there were researched, educated es ti-mates. For example, the U.S. Census Bureau figured it was about 230,000. Th e General Accounting Office"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"of Congress put the number between 300,000 and 600, 000. The Urban Institute said that there were somewhere between 355,000 and 462,0 00 homeless Americans. These numbers weren't state secrets. Reporters knew what they were. They just didn't care. Meanwhile, the homeless lobby was putting the numbe r of homeless in the millions. No matter how bad a problem really is, ad vocates think they need to portray it as worse. This is standard operating pro cedure with lobbies. Pump up the number of victims and we stand a better chance of getting more sympathy and support - more money - for our cause is what they c orrectly think. We have come to expect this of advocates. They know their cause is worthy, so what harm can a little exaggeration do? But reporte rs - when they also see the cause as worthy - buy into it. They also become adv o-cates. They take the numbers as gospel. They have no desire to look too deep, because if they do, God forbid, they might find something they'd rather not find. There's an old saying in the newsroom: Don't let the facts stand in the w ay of a good story! So in 1989 on CNN, Candy Crowley, a fine, serious r eporter, said that \"winter is on the way and three million Americans have no plac e to call home.\" Three million! Not to be outdone, in January of 1993, Jackie Nespr al, then the anchor of NBC Weekend Today, said, \"nationally right now, five mi llion people are believed to be homeless... and the numbers are increasing.\" Five million!! And the numbers are increasing!!! Charles Osgood of CBS News, one of the most talente d journalists in all of broadcasting, reported, \"It is estimated that by th e year 2000, nineteen million Americans will be homeless unless something is done , and done now.\" Nineteen million homeless by the turn of the centur y!!!! And Ray Brady, one of the best in the business, who was reporting for the CBS Evening News, found homeless people who actually li ved in homes. These were - ready for this? - the \"hidden homeless.\" Who are they? People who aren't homeless at all, bu t, because they can't afford their own places, are living at home with Mom and D ad, often in cushy houses in the suburbs with big-screen TVs and three squares a day. It's as if our coverage of this very big story was being directed not by objective journalists but by the advocates for the homeless themselves. We took what they said at face value even though we would n ever do that with advocates for causes we did not embrace. Can we really imag-i ne Rather, Brokaw, and Jennings simply passing along propaganda from the p ro-life lobby? Or the anti-affirmative action crowd? Or the NRA? We would never try to build up sympathy for those causes or their supporters! But advocates for the homeless misled us about all sorts of things - the number of homeless, who they were, why they were homeless - and because we embraced their cause, because we felt right at home on the h omeless beat, we pretty much said, \"Hey, no problem,\" and passed their misinform ation on to the American people. \"Of all the lies that are swallowed and regurgitate d by the media, the ones that hurt the most come from the Good Guys,\" Katherine D unn wrote in the New Republic in 1993. \"The grass-roots do-gooders, the social wo rk heroes, the non-profit advocacy groups battling for peace, justice, and eq uality.\" Who wants to get tough with people like that? They want to make things better,"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"don't they? But \"holding the good guys accountable, \" she wrote, \"doesn't mean that they are bad guys....Apply equal skepticism to both sides. And if your mother says she loves you, check it out.\" In a story, groundbreaking for its candor, on May 2 2, 1989, Gina Kolata wrote on page one of the New York Times that \"drug and alcoh ol abuse have emerged as a major reason for the homelessness of men, women, an d families.\" As my young daughter, Catherine, might put it... Du hhh! It sounds so obvious now. But this was actually leg itimate front-page news in 1989, because homeless advocates didn't like to tal k about such things with reporters. In that story, Robert Hayes revealed for the first time that homeless advocates like himself didn't tell reporters the whole truth because they feared the public would lose sympathy for the homeless. They m isled reporters about how many of the homeless were also criminals. They misl ed the media about how many were addicts. But Hayes said it was time to end the deception. \"T he bottom line,\" he said, \"is that we have to tell the truth.\" For years, the activists played the media as if the y were part of the homeless PR machine. And reporters were more than willing to go along and be yanked around by the homeless lobby. A lot of news peo-ple , after all, got into journalism in the first place so they could change the world and make it a better place. Rallying support for the homeless was a golden opportunity. Besides, showing compassion makes us feel good abou t ourselves, which is no small point when you consider the abundance of narc issists who populate the world of television news. When the \"proper\" victims are involved, we become j ournalist/ social workers. And we live by the journalist/social worker motto: Afflict the comfortable and comfort the afflicted. \"Increasingly, journalists see themselves as societ y's designated sav-iors,\" Robert Lichter of the nonpartisan Center for Media and Public Affairs in Washington told me. In the late 1980s, Lichter and his team analyzed 10 3 stories on the ABC, NBC, and CBS evening newscasts as well as twenty-six art icles in Time, Newsweek, and U.S. News & World Report. The results, Lichter says , \"provide a blueprint of advocacy journalism.\" \"Only one source in twenty-five,\" Lichter concluded , \"blamed homelessness on the personal problems of the homeless themselves, such as mental illness, drug or alcohol abuse, or lack of skills or moti-vation. Th e other 96 percent blamed social or political conditions for their plight. Th e primary culprit cited was the housing market, includ-ing forces like high mor tgage interest rates, high rents, downtown redevelopment, etc. Next in line wa s government inaction, especially the government's failure to provide adeq uate public housing.\" To a lot of journalists in the press and TV, the vi llain was - who else? - Ronald Reagan, who in their view was the embodiment of the greedy 1980s. To them he was the typical archconservative, a politician w ho sim-ply had no compassion for the homeless. As a matter of routine, they made it look as if the Reagan administration practically invented homelessness. The media drumbeat was that Ronald Reagan's spendin g policies - not the pathologies of the homeless - were behind this terr ible problem of homeless"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Americans. On ABC News, John Martin reported on a rally in Oct ober 1989 in support of the homeless. \"They came here to Washington from all ov er the country,\" Martin told his audience, \"the rich, the famous, the ordi-nary, the down-and-out. They staged the biggest rally in behalf of the homeless since the Reagan Revolution forced severe cutbacks in gov-ernment housing progr ams.\" In a prime-time special on the 1980s in December 19 89, Tom Brokaw said, \"Reagan, as commander in chief, was the military's best frie nd. He gave the Pentagon almost everything it wanted.\" Then, with pictures o f the homeless on the TV screen, Brokaw said, \"Social programs? They suffere d under Reagan. But he refused to see the cause and effect.\" Garrick Utley, then of NBC News, reported in Novemb er 1990, \"In the 1980s, the Reagan years, the amount of government money spent to build low-income housing was cut drastically. Then homelessness began to app ear on streets and in doorsteps.\" In the report that followed, Ed Rabel said, \"During the Reagan years, according to the Congressional Budget Office, housing program s for the poor were slashed by billions of dollars: an 80 percent cut over eigh t years.\" All of these reports were aired after the New York Times - the Holy Bible that TV journalists normally consult to find out not onl y what they should cover but how they should cover it - ran its front-page story that revealed the real culprit behind the homelessness problem was drug an d alcohol abuse, not Ronald Reagan. All of these TV reports came out after that story i n the Times quoted Irving Shandler, who ran a rehabilitation center in Philad elphia, saying that \"substance abuse is one of the major issues causing people to be homeless and keeping them homeless.\" Did anyone, least of all seasoned reporters who pri de themselves on their skepticism, really believe that the vast majority o f the homeless - the addicted and the mentally ill - would virtually dis appear from America's streets if only Ronald Reagan hadn't cut housing programs? Scott Shuger, a Washington journalist who wrote a p iece in the Washington Monthly - \"Who Are the Homeless?\" - certainly didn' t. In a monument to common sense and politically incorrect wisdom, Shuger wrot e, \"There can be all the low-cost housing in the world and an untreated para noid won't set foot in it, and an untreated schizo-phrenic might burn it down. ...-And a drug addict will spend the rent money on crack.\" While economic factors, like affordable housing and jobs, are impor-tant, Shuger pointed out that other factors are even more import ant. \"So homelessness is in large measure a mental health problem that defies t he conventional liberal answers of housing and jobs,\" he wrote. But on the evening newscasts, the drumbeat went on and on. It was Reagan who was to blame. While his tax cuts created a whole new cl ass of ostentatiously rich Americans - yuppies with big expense accounts, big cigars, and even bigger limos - there was The Other America, where the homeless l ived on the street and ate in soup kitchens, inno-cent victims of a conservative president's insensitivity. It was a great story... even if it wasn't quite tru e. For reporters who were too young to cover the great civil rights struggle of t he 1960s, the homeless story twenty years later was the next best thing."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"In a December 1989 Wall Street Journal piece, Rober t Lichter wrote, \"The homeless story is becoming the 1980s counterpart of the 1960s civil rights story - a stark moral issue that calls for journalists to awaken the national conscience and force public action. The difficulty is that this advocacy approach can skew the depiction of the actual probl em. And misperceptions born of good intentions are not the most promising basis for choosing the best ways to help the homeless.\" In the end it didn't matter, because in the early 1 990s a miracle descended upon the land. Homelessness disappeared. It was over. It no longer existed in the entire United States of America! It was a fantastic story. A too-good-to-be-true sto ry. I know that homelessness ceased to exist because I watch television news. If homeless people still existed, Dan and Tom and Pete r would have them all over the news. I mean, can you think of a better TV stor y than one showing poor, desperate homeless people begging for some loose ch ange or sleeping in cardboard boxes ...in the bitter cold? I could be wrong, but I think homelessness ended th e day Bill Clinton was sworn in as president. Which is one of those incredible c oincidences, since it pretty much began the day Ronald Reagan was sworn in as pr esident. What are the odds? So what gives? Why did network television and Ameri ca's most important newspapers virtually stop covering homelessness in America, a story they were so in love with just a few years earlier? Maybe reporters just got tired of the same old stor y after a decade. Those blond-haired, blue-eyed homeless families made for good TV - but enough already! And those less savory, less attractive homeless peo ple we eventually got around to showing on TV - when we weren't busy prettifying reality - the ones who had lost their minds after years of drug abuse and were now yelling at tormentors in the sky - they made for good TV, too. But after ten long years maybe even these strange people stopped entertaining us. We are, aft er all, a nation that gets bored easily. Everything - especially everything on television - must entertain us. Or else it must go. Maybe journalist/social workers, along with the res t of America, simply were suffering from compassion fatigue, and after a deca de of putting the homeless on TV, we finally got depressed with the whole bunch o f them. Maybe it was because, as Lee Stringer explains in h is book Grand Central Winter, which chronicles his own homeless years living on t he streets of New York City, \"When the homeless ceased to be portrayed as blamel ess victims, people ceased to care. The image became one of people who just might have some complicity in their circumstances, and that changed the mood grea tly.\" Or maybe it was something else altogether. Maybe th e critics on the right - who saw media conspiracies all over the place - were ac tually onto something this time. Did the media really discover homelessness be cause a Republican became president, only to forget it when a Demo-crat was e lected? Yes, according to Philip Terzian, an editor at the Providence Journal in Rhode Island, who worked in the administration of Preside nt Jimmy Carter. In 1999 he wrote a column about the homeless and ab out a Village Voice study that showed that in 1988 the New York Times ran fif ty stories on the homeless,"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"including five on page one. But a decade later, in 1998, the Times ran only ten homeless stories, and none on page one. And since t he networks take their cues from the Times, their coverage dropped off sharply, too. The conservative Media Research Center found that in 1990, when George Bus h was president, there were seventy-one home-less stories on the ABC, CBS, NBC, and CNN evening newscasts. But in 1995, when Bill Clinton was in the White Hou se, the number had gone down to just nine! \"The cynic in me has an obvious explanation,\" Terzi an wrote. \"In 1988, instead of a compassionate Democrat, there was a heartless Republican in the White House. Indeed, if you track press attention to home lessness, you will find a dramatic leap in coverage beginning in the early 19 80s - when Ronald Reagan took office.\" \"The problem with homelessness,\" Terzian continued, \"is that, for too long, it has been an issue of partisan convenience. It is no t Republican spending policies that caused the explosion in homeless-ness but the progressive vision of closing down state mental institu-tions, the ris e in drug and alcohol abuse, and the loss of any stigma attached to subsisting i n the streets.\" A few years earlier, in 1996, another \"cynic,\" Andr ew Peyton Thomas, wrote (in the notoriously conservative Weekly Standard): \"The Right might well respond that the election of Bill Clinton made the [homeles s] issue go away, since it was anti-Republican animus that brought the issue t o life in the early 1980s.\" I choose not to believe any of that. Instead, I cho ose to believe that the reason the press and TV did a million homeless stor ies during the Reagan years and virtually none during the Clinton years is beca use there was a big homeless problem under Ronald Reagan and no home-less proble m under Bill Clinton. I also choose to believe that when the Sunday editi on of ABC World News Tonight rediscovered the homeless story just three weeks af ter George W. Bush was sworn in as president it was nothing more than coincidenc e. That when reporter Bob Jamieson said, \"In New York City the number of home less in the shelter system has risen above twenty-five thousand a night for th e first time since the late 1980s,\" it was not an attempt to say, \"Here we go a gain - a Republican is in the White House and the homeless are back.\" And on Augu st 4, 2001, when CNN also rediscovered homelessness and quoted sources saying , \"The number of homeless people is on the rise this summer,\" I choose to bel ieve it was not CNN's way of suggesting that now that a conservative Republican is president, Reagan-era misery will soon be back with us in full force. Instead I choose to believe homelessness really is a thing of the past and that we will not see a renewed interest in the homeless story just because Bill Clinton is gone and George W. Bush is in. I choose to believe the media would never play politics with poor homeless people. I ch oose to believe that Bill Clinton really did end homelessness and that the en d of homelessness is good news. Fantastic news. I choose to believe it is too -good-to-be-true news. Epidemic Of Fear Like most terrible human tragedies, AIDS was a grea t news story. A mysterious virus comes out of nowhere and goes on a killing sp ree. Its earliest victims are mostly young gay men, who slowly, but all too surel y, lose their strength and wither away. Sometimes they break out in purple spl otches. In their final days they are skeletons. And then they die."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Where did the virus come from? Why did some people get it and not others? Could you \"catch\" it if someone sneezed on you? Could you get it from a kiss? What if you shook hands with someone who had AIDS - that ki ll you? It didn't take long before the scientists discovere d that HIV, the AIDS virus, was carried in blood and semen. That explained why its victims were mainly gay men who engaged in high-risk anal sex and junkies w ho shot drugs into their veins and shared \"dirty\" needles. In the early days , some got the disease from blood transfusions. Hemo-philiacs were especially a t risk. By any imaginable standard, this should have been b ad enough. These were human beings dying terrible deaths. What could be worse? How about the possibility that this virus that was picking off junkies and gay men might start to spread to housewives in Des Moin es and businessmen in Seattle? How about the possibility that before long it would n't just be homo-sexual men at gay bars who would have to wonder if their next partner would be the one with the deadly virus? What if everyone who was hav-ing sex was playing Russian roulette? It was a nightmare scenario. And it was exactly the story that AIDS activists desperately wanted to put out. The goal was simple: scare the hell out of straight America - then they would have to pay atte ntion. Otherwise, the activists feared, there would never be a national out-cry over AIDS. Middle America would never get worked up enou gh - and neither would Congress or the president - to spend whatever it to ok to combat this modern-day plague. As long as the people dying were mostly gay men and junkies, the AIDS lobby had a problem. The activists knew, instinctively, that Main Street America did not see these people as sympathetic characters. Junkies died ever y day, from overdoses and who knows what. So what if there was now a virus that w as also killing them. The activists knew that America would never lose sleep over drug addicts dying from something called HIV. And homosexuals? The gay lobby was convinced that s traight Americans didn't care what happened to them, either. But if the activists somehow could persuade America that gays and junkies were only the first w ave, that heterosexuals were next, then the nation surely would demand that the government put all its efforts into finding a cure or a vaccine - anything ! - to combat this deadly disease. But to do this, the activists needed their compassi onate friends in the media. No problem! It was the homeless story all over again. Tell the American people there were AIDS victims just like themselves - if not right no w, soon - then maybe they would care enough to do something about the prob-le m. The battle cry was as clear as can be: no one is safe anymore! Once again, the media were more than willing to set aside their usual skepticism and go right along. While AIDS was devastating mino r-ity and gay communities in America, while it was leaving Middle America virtua lly untouched, the news stories conjured up some other reality. U.S. News & World Report said, \"The disease of them is suddenly the disease of us.\" USA Today ran a headline that said, \"Cases Rising F astest Among Heterosexuals.\""},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Time reported: \"The proportion of heterosexual case s... is increas-ing at a worrisome rate...The numbers as yet are small, but AI DS is a growing threat to the heterosexual population.\" The Atlantic Monthly headlined a cover story: \"Hete rosexuals and AIDS: The Second Stage of the Epidemic.\" The Ladies Home Journal ran a story with this tease on the cover: \"AIDS & Marriage: What Every Wife Must Know.\" And in 1987, one of the most famous, beloved, and l istened-to Americans of all weighed in with a warning about heterosexual AIDS. \"AIDS has both sexes running scared. Research studi es now project that one in five - listen to me, hard to believe - one in five heterosexuals could be dead from AIDS at the end of the next three years. That' s by 1990. One in five. It is no longer just a gay disease. Believe me.\" Who wouldn't believe Oprah Winfrey? Especially abou t something so important. Especially when the federal government put up nearl y five million dollars for an \"AIDS Doesn't Discriminate\" advertising campaign th at focused mainly on the one group that wasn't in real dan-ger: heterosexuals wh o were not having sex with junkies. No wonder an epidemic was racing across America. An epidemic of fear. You couldn't open a newspaper, turn the page of a magaz ine, or tune in to the nightly news without reading or hearing about the d eadly link between AIDS and heterosexuals. The hysteria was creating a gen-erat ion, perhaps the first generation ever, to equate sex with death! But you couldn't really blame the media, not at fir st, anyway. Not when so many authorities were feeding them the horror stories. D r. Robert Redfield, an infectious disease specialist at Walter Reed Army H ospital in Washington, told the Associated Press in 1985, \"This is a general di sease now. Get rid of the high-risk groups, anyone can get it.\" In 1987 the highly respected surgeon general, C. Ev erett Koop, said AIDS was \"the biggest threat to health this nation has ever faced.\" Despite evidence to the contrary - heterosexuals we re not falling by the wayside like junkies or gay men - the press, especially TV, loved the \"No One Is Safe Anymore\" story. Did the media continue to run with it for selfish, cynical reasons? To boost their circulation and ratings? If I've learned anyt hing after all these years as a network newsman, I know this much: never - never! - underestimate how low news executives, and TV people in general, will go in the pursuit of higher ratings. If CBS, ABC, and NBC News could frighten M ain Street America about how AIDS was heading toward their peaceful, suburban st reets and then do stories about how scared America was, they would do it! But, as usual, it wasn't just ratings. More than ever, journalists on the Left define them selves by their compassion. They might as well wear big red buttons on their la pels that say \"We Care.\" AIDS gave them a great opportunity to care, to show how compassionate they could be. To these journalists, AIDS couldn't just be their d isease - it had to be everyone's disease. Gay men along with blacks and H ispanics might be segregated from other parts of society, but when it comes to A IDS, we're all in it together. It was journalism by sentiment. As with t he homeless story, this one also was being reported by the Victims of America c orrespondents, the ones who"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"specialize in uncritical stories about the downtrod den. They could unite us all. By God, they could integra te America! As long as they told us that AIDS was \"now everybody's disease,\" th at \"now no one is safe from AIDS,\" then all of us - whites, blacks, Hispanics, men, women, gays, and straights - would be equals. All of us would be equ ally susceptible to the killer virus that, as we were so often told, \"does not discriminate.\" It's a good thing they were wrong. Or else we might all be dead by now. The fact is, as Michael Fumento put it in his meticulously d ocumented 1990 book, The Myth of Heterosexual AIDS, \"AIDS remains a disease limit ed primarily to specific groups engaging in specific practices.\" Very politically incorrect. Fumento was actually sa ying that AIDS was not everybody's disease and that it did discriminate. Heterosexuals, Fumento wrote, certainly do get AIDS . That's not the myth. But they get it \"from shared needles, from transfusions , from clotting factor, which hemophiliacs use to control internal bleeding, from their mothers at or before birth, and sometimes through sexual intercourse wit h persons in these categories and bisexuals. The pri-mary myth, however, was that the disease was no longer anchored to these groups but was, in fact, going fr om heterosexual to heterosexual to heterosexual through intercourse, t hat it was epidemic among non-drug-abusing heterosexuals.\" Fumento had been an AIDS analyst at the U.S. Commis sion on Civil Rights in the Reagan administration. I interviewed him in Califor nia after his book came out, and just after he accidentally drove his brand-new sports car over a cliff on the Pacific Coast Highway. His fiancée, who was in the car with him, was hospitalized, but to the dismay of his critics, Fum ento survived and, except for a few cuts, was in pretty good shape when we talked . He was friendly and certainly didn't come off as some right-wing, antig ay crusader. Nonetheless, gay activists despised him because of his book. One gay journalist called him a \"hate-filled, untalented lying loser.\" The title of Fumento's book was enough to scare many major bookstores from even carrying it, fearing picketing and worse from militant gay activists. Some bookstore owners, those noble creatures who te ll us how they would gladly die in defense of free speech, no matter how unpopu lar, refused to put The Myth of Heterosexual AIDS on their shelves. Fumento says when a friend tried to buy the book in New York City, the store manager said h e didn't carry it \"for editorial reasons.\" A doctor in San Diego, who coul dn't get the book either, reported to Fumento that a store clerk told him the book was \"politically incorrect.\" The same high-minded philosopher/capitalists who se t aside entire sections for volumes on such weighty topics as UFOs, ESP, and an gels had no room for The Myth of Heterosexual AIDS. Fumento believes that \"the AI DS crisis and the way our government, our leaders, and the media have manipul ated it have provided perhaps the single best exam-ple of the politically correct intellectual dark ages into which our coun-try has fallen.\" \"At least since 1986,\" Fumento writes, \"the governm ent has been misleading the public on the extent of the AIDS epidemic. That was when the federal Centers for Disease Control decided to move all AIDS sufferers of African and Haitian origin into the category of het-erosexual AIDS cases. A ma n from Zaire who had sex with a dozen other men, shared needles, and had a blood transfusion would, upon"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"diagnosis, automatically be put into the heterosexu al category because of his origin. \"The result of shifting all these cases into the he terosexual category,\" Fumento concluded, \"was a doubling of that category from 2 to 4 percent of the total. Rather than cry foul, however, our media watchdogs jumped on this statistical artifact to launch their first wave of AIDS terror. \" The stories were scaring the hell out of millions o f Americans. In the beginning, it probably couldn't be helped. Maybe AI DS really would start to spread among heterosexuals, through sex, from one t o another to another and on and on. In the early days, I interviewed \"experts\" who told me exactly that - and I put it on the air. Who knew? But after the virus was around for a while, I start ed to wonder: where are all these straight Americans with AIDS? I didn't know a ny. My friends and neighbors didn't know any. I had read about two brothers with hemophilia who lived in my area and who died of AIDS because the clotting fact or they used to control bleeding was infected with HIV. But where was this epidemic I kept reading about in the newspapers and hearing about on the televisi on news? There was no escaping the fact that the news I was getting from the press and TV didn't jibe with reality. When I read a study from the Cen-ter for Media and Public Affairs (the same research team in Washingto n, D.C., that had written about the real homeless versus the homeless por-tra yed on television), I understood why. The center monitored network TV stories in 1992 and concluded that \"TV's visual portrait of AIDS victims has little in common with real life.\" The center compared the people on TV, using only the infor-mat ion provided in the story, with \"real-world data on AIDS victims compiled by t he Centers for Disease Control\": • During the period studied, 6 percent of the peopl e with AIDS shown on the evening news were gay men. But in real life 58 per- cent were gay men. • On TV, 16 percent were blacks and Hispanics. But in real life 46 percent were black or Hispanic. • On TV, 2 percent of the AIDS sufferers were IV dr ug users. In real life 23 percent were. \"Thus, the risk groups the news audience sees are v ery different from their real-world counterparts,\" was the report's conclusi on. As with the homeless, television was back in the bu siness of prettify-ing reality. Make the victims look more like you and me , and maybe we can drum up some support for their cause while we're drumming u p some support for our ratings. And unlike other ailments, like cancer and heart disease, AIDS had civil rights. \"How did you get it?\" was considered an uncivil question. In 1991, when Magic Johnson told the world he had H IV, Dan Rather looked into the camera and proved once again that it was more i mportant to be politically correct than factually correct. \"As correspondent Richard Threlkeld reports, the pe rception may finally be catching up with the reality. That reality is: AIDS is not, quote, 'just a gay disease!'\" Then Threlkeld, a smart, veteran newsman, narrated, over pictures of Magic: \"Magic Johnson's just the man to educate the rest o f us about AIDS. He's not a"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"drug user. Neither are most AIDS victims. He's het- erosexual. So are four out often AIDS victims these days.\" Let's set aside some important assumptions Threlkel d casually makes about how Magic did or did not get the virus. Because the fac t is, Richard Threlkeld knows nothing about how Magic Johnson got HIV. When Threlkeld came on the air that night and repor ted that four out often people with AIDS are heterosexuals, I got a certain impres-sion. My guess is so did most of the people who watched the CBS Evening News that night. When a reporter tells you that four out of ten peop le with AIDS are heterosexuals, it's reasonable to think he's talkin g about straight, non-IV-drug-using Americans who are getting AIDS th rough sexual intercourse. But that's not at all what Richard Threlkeld was ta lking about. Because most of that 40 percent Threlkeld cites got the virus not sim-ply because they were heterosexual but because they wer e shooting up or having unprotected sex with people who were shooting up. T he other heterosexuals apparently were patients in hospitals who got trans fusions tainted with HIV, hemophiliacs, maybe even \"heterosexual\" babies born to mothers who were HIV positive. You would have to include all those group s in order to say four out often HIV cases involve heterosexuals. But what if 40 percent of the people with HIV are P rotestants? Or 40 percent have brown eyes? Or 40 percent have dark hair and a re under six foot two? No reporter in his right mind would tell his audi-ence , \"He's Protestant and so are four out of ten victims these days.\" Or, \"He has br own eyes and so have four out often victims these days.\" Harry Stein, a good friend and author of How I Acci dentally Joined the Vast Right-Wing Conspiracy (and Found Inner Peace), wrot e in his TV Guide column in 1994 that \"AIDS is presented not just as a hideous disease, but as a gauge of our collective humanity.\" That is precisely why so many reporters would not ask, \"How did you get it?\" It some-how seemed inhumane. It seemed as if we were not sympathetic. So when Dave Marash did his Magic Johnson story for Nightline on ABC, he said, \"Our curiosity about people with AIDS has often bee n limited to one hostile question: How did you get it?\" Why in the world is that a hostile question? If Dav e Marash did a story about lung cancer, he certainly wouldn't consider it \"hos tile\" to ask, \"How did you get it?\" - especially if he knew the answer was \"Th ree packs of Marlboros a day for twenty-five years, Dave.\" Dave, and every other reporter, would relish the opportunity to take on Big Tobacco, given the miser y smoking has caused. But AIDS is different. It's off limits. Only AIDS i s shrouded in polit-ical correctness. We might offend gays if we ask, \"How d id you get it?\" We fear we may look uncaring and without compassion if we ask, \"How did you get it?\" In 1996, Jacqueline Adams did a story for CBS News about teenagers with AIDS and reported that the problem was mainly the result of these kids having unprotected sex. \"Ten years ago, at age fourteen, Luna [Ortiz] was i nfected with the HIV virus, the very first time he had sex - unprotected sex,\" Adams reported. Then she introduced us to a woman named Patricia Fl eming, an AIDS activist, who said, \"At least one American teenager is becoming i nfected every hour of every day.\" (Six months later, in September of 1996, anot her CBS News reporter, Diana"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Olick, reported, \"The num-ber of HIV-infected teens continues to rise. Every hour two kids under the age of twenty are infected. \" Two - not one! As with the homeless story, the numbers keep going higher and h igher until they bear no rela-tionship whatsoever to reality. Stay tuned!) There was one word missing from Jacqueline Adams's story. Never, not even once, did she or any of the people she interviewed ever u tter the word \"gay\" or \"homosexual.\" This is quite remarkable: a story abo ut AIDS and unprotected sex, yet the reporter doesn't tell us any-thing about th e sexual orientation of the person with HIV. The closest anyone came was when Luna said, \"I wasn 't educated about it [AIDS]. The only thing I knew was Rock Hudson died a year b efore.\" Was that the clue that Luna was gay? I don't know. Adams never told u s. By leaving out the crucial fact that almost all of these teenage AIDS cases involve homosexual sex or IV drugs or tainted blood , we are left with the impression that straight, middle-class heterosexual teens are being infected with HIV \"every hour of every day.\" It's simply not happening! That anyone is still con tracting HIV is a tragedy of huge proportions. That the gay lobby would try to m islead us is understandable. That the media go along is disgraceful. By now, we all know that AIDS has ravaged vast regi ons in Africa and that HIV is spreading like the plague through the old Soviet Un ion and parts of the Far East. By 2021, according to the United Nations, mor e than 150 million people will have been infected with HIV worldwide. By any standard, this is horrific.   We also know that in places like Africa and Russia, it isn't just gays and junk ies who are contracting HIV. But by now, there's something else we know: that Am erica is not Africa, and it's not Russia or China. We have better education about HIV here. We have better health care. Fewer people walk around with open sor es on their genitals, which facilitate the transmission of the AIDS virus. Hosp itals don't routinely use the same needles on many different patients. Prostituti on isn't ram-pant the way it is in some other parts of the world. To suggest tha t, because AIDS is ravaging heterosexuals in parts of Uganda and China, Seattle and Kansas City are next simply is not so. Of course, there are some places in the United Stat es where people are so poor and where access to health care is so limited that the HIV epidemic \"more closely resembles the situation of the developing w orld than of the rest of the country,\" as the New York Times put it on July 3, 2 001. Under a headline that read \"Epidemic Takes Toll on Black Women,\" the Times told us about poor, rural southern women who were contra cting HIV through unprotected heterosexual sex. For most straight Americans this is very scary news - Americans getting the AIDS virus through heterosexu al intercourse! Except that, despite the headline, this wasn't simply a story ab out AIDS and poor black women. It was a story, as we learn in paragraph thi rty-six on page twelve, about how, \"As everywhere, some poor women here make ends meet through prostitution.\" And about how, as we're told in paragraph forty-one , \"Sex is also sometimes exchanged for drugs, particularly crack cocaine.\" We also learn that a majority of the women who atte nd one particu-lar clinic in Greenwood, Mississippi, have a history of sexually trans-mitted diseases. What all of this, taken together, means is that bla ck women who are contracting"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"HIV in the rural South, by and large, are not getti ng it sim-ply because they are poor and black and having sex with men. They're getting it because they are engaging in high-risk sex, including having interco urse with men who use crack cocaine and probably, given the behavior of people who use crack, are also taking other drugs that involve contaminated needle s. The Times story was legitimate, well reported, and, I'm sure, accu-rate, but it was informative not just for what was in the piece but for what was left out. Nowhere, for example, does the story actually tell us that there is no evidence that these women who contracted HIV from heterosexu al men are passing the virus on to other men who are then passing it on to other women. If the virus were spreading that way - from heterosexual to heterosex ual to heterosexual - it would truly be devastating informa-tion. Because th en there would be proof, for the first time, that HIV really was breaking out in to the low-risk general population, a deadly scenario the gay activists and the media had been warning straight America about for years. In fact, the absence of such man-to-woman-to-man-to -woman trans-mission was exceedingly good news. Even in a part of America wh ere economic and health conditions rival those in Africa, there was no evid ence that the AIDS virus was ping-ponging through the hetero-sexual population. But this wasn't news the Times thought important en ough to put in this particular story. Maybe because this isn't the type of news that AIDS activists have ever wanted to get out. But the Times does tel l us, in a small subheadline accompanying the story, \"In the South, a Different Face.\" But is the face really different? Yes, it's true that the face was not tha t of a gay white man. Or of hookers in big-city alleys shoot-ing up heroin. Sti ll, in the poor, rural South, like everyplace else in America, the face of AIDS i s attached to people who, by and large, engage in risky sexual business - and to their newborn babies. It's a sad story. But sometimes I get the impressio n that the media that have helped spread the epidemic of fear would love to sp read it just a little more. Sometimes I get the impression that they'd like to write a headline that shouts: \"AIDS Epidemic Takes Toll on the Middle Class.\" The n it really would be everyone's disease. Not just the disease of junkies and gays and poor black people in the rural South. Then no one would be saf e, just as the media have been telling us for so many years. And then, finall y, we would all be equal. Here's what we do know about AIDS and HIV in Americ a. By the end of 1999, according to the Centers for Di sease Control and Prevention (CDC), 751,965 people, living and dead, had contrac ted AIDS in the United States since the beginning of the epidemic: • About 50 percent were men who had sex with other men. • 28 percent were IV drug users. • 6 percent more were men who had sex with men and injected drugs. • 1 percent got HIV through a blood transfusion. . • Less than 1 percent were hemophiliacs. That leaves about 13 or 14 percent - 99,483 cases - listed officially as \"heterosexual contact.\" But not just any heterosexu al contact. Of those, about 35,000 got AIDS after having sex wi th an IV drug user, most of them women who got HIV from a man who injected drug s. Another 4,000 women got HIV and eventually AIDS from a bisexual male. Anoth er 1,681 got AIDS after having sex with a hemophiliac or with someone who h ad had a blood transfusion"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"that was infected with HIV. And then there's the mystery group, the group that helps feed the myth about heterosexual AIDS. The CDC lists 58,571 people in the United States as having gotten AIDS after \"sex with HIV-infected person, risk not specified.\" Risk not specified! It even sounds frightening. Does that mean that 58,000 people - about 7 percent of all the AIDS cases ever diagnosed in the United States - got AIDS simply by having sex with another heterosexual who was not in one of the high-risk gr oups? Is this what some scientists, public health officials, the gay spe-ci al interest groups, and the media were all talking about for all these years: h eterosexuals who got AIDS from other non-drug-using hetero-sexuals through st raight sex and then passed it on to other heterosexu-als who passed it on to othe r heterosexuals who passed it on... ? Not likely. People lie about sex and sexually trans mitted diseases all the time. \"How did you get syphilis?\" the doctor asks. \"From the toilet seat,\" the embarrassed man or woman answers. Or simply, \"I don 't know.\" Isn't the same likely with AIDS? The answer seems to be a strong \"yes.\" During the m id-1980s, a New York City health department employee, Anastasia Lekatsas, who was dubbed \"America's most dogged street detective of AIDS,\" spent hundreds of hours trying to track down the source of HIV among peo-ple who claimed they go t it from heterosexual sex with someone not in a high-risk group. According to the New York Times, \"If a man claimed to have gotten AIDS from a woman, she w ould visit him, revisit him, interview his family and friends - and eventually s he would almost always find that he'd been sharing needles or having sex with m en.\" So how many heterosexual Americans got AIDS from an other het-erosexual not in a high-risk group? Nobody knows. But the data would i ndicate the number is very, very small. Whatever it is, it's too high. Too tragic. But it s imply doesn't warrant the panic the media put America through. When the cover of Life told us in 1985 that \"Now No One Is Safe from AIDS,\" it had the story al l wrong. So did all the others that warned of the coming heterosexual AIDS epidemic. Maybe not in the beginning, but at some point, repo rters should have known better. Still, they continued to spread the myth of hetero-sexual AIDS, letting their compassion get in the way of their reporting, just as they did with the homeless story. Reporters were again doing the work of the activists because they sympathized with the cause. While it might hav e seemed compassionate, in a liberal kind of way, it might have had the opposite effect of what they intended. \"The first step in controlling a communicable disea se,\" Michael Fumento wrote, \"is to determine who is getting it and how. The dis in-formation campaign that grossly overemphasized the groups and activi-ties l east at risk of getting AIDS does those in greater jeopardy no favor.\" There's another way to look at it. What is it costi ng the media to be generous - to suspend our healthy journalistic skepticism - wh en peo-ple are in real need? By spreading fear about AIDS - by doing the work of gay activists - we journalists got Washington to pay attention, didn't we? There's so much to gain by being compassionate. The only thing we lose is o ur credibility."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"\"The Killer Next Door\" is what the prime-time CBS N ews program 48 Hours called its show about AIDS in the suburbs. Great title. Es pecially if you're trying to scare the hell out of your audience and get good ra tings at the same time. \"The Killer Next Door\" was shot in 1992, mostly in Orange County, California - home of John Wayne Airport and for a long time the very symbol of conservative, middle-class, white, suburban America. That, of cou rse, was the point - that AIDS was now everyone's disease, that it was no lon ger just the disease of gay men in places like Greenwich Village and the Castro section of San Francisco - o r mostly black and Hispanic junkies in Harlem and Watts. AIDS was now \"The Kill er Next Door.\" ; It was a dramatic and scary program... and monument ally dishonest. \"Kimberly Richards has AIDS,\" reporter Erin Moriart y tells us. \"She is twenty-five years old.\" Kimberly lets us know that \"I'm middle class, I'm c ollege educated, I'm married, and I have a baby. That's not what doctors think a person with HIV is.\" Moriarty reports that \"Kimberly thinks she was infe cted through unprotected sex when she was a teenager.\" She lets it go at that, l eaving us to believe that not only was Kimberly your typical American subur-ban t eenager, but so was the boy she had sex with. You see how easy it is for any of us to get AIDS? My God, it really is \"The Killer Next Door.\" But wouldn't we have learned more if we had known w hether Kimberly was having unprotected sex with an IV drug user? Did she ever inject herself with a needle to shoot drugs? Moriarty doesn't go into that, eith er. All we need to know is that Kimberly is white, subur-ban, and college educ ated - just like many of the people sitting at home watching 48 Hours, and their kids. If Kimberly can get AIDS.... Then reporter Richard Schlesinger takes us to Orang e County's Foothill High School and tells us that it's a place \"where, like so many other places in suburban America, children are waking to a frighten ing new fact of life: the shadow of certain death.\" Children waking to a new reality - the shadow of ce rtain death? This is what happens when entertainment \"values\" infect the news . We get writing that sounds more like a promotional blurb for a Stephen King th riller than nonfiction copy for a program produced by CBS News. Schlesinger goes on to describe an assembly at Foot hill High, where the three guest speakers all have the AIDS virus. One of them , Schlesinger reports, is special, in that her \"words strike particularly clo se to home.\" Why? Because, she tells the assembly, while the 48 Hours cameras are rolling, \"I graduated from Foothill in 1984....I was sitting where you were, you know. Please don't be s itting where I am a few years from now.\"    It's terribly sad. So sad that Richard Schlesinger doesn't think we need to know anything more. How she got the virus is something S chlesinger doesn't get into. Was she shooting up? Who knows? No hostile question s allowed. The other speakers tell their stories, too. One of them, a man, says, \"The AIDS virus can attack any race, social class, sex, or ag e group.\" True enough. Straight, middle-class suburbanites co uld get AIDS and so could"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"teenagers in small-town America. There were well-pu blicized and very sad stories in the fall of 1997 about the girls in Jamestown, N ew York, who befriended a New York City junkie. He had made frequent trips upstat e, won the girls over, had sex with them, and left them with HIV. But by and l arge, heterosexuals who didn't befriend drug addicts had a greater chance o f drowning in a bathtub than getting AIDS. But the aim, of course, of this young man with the AIDS virus at Foothill High in Orange County, California, was to scare the hell out of the kids in front of him. And 48 Hour’s point was to scare the hell out of America. Scaring the hell out of people makes for good television even when i t makes for shallow journalism. So 48 Hours believes we don't need to k now any of the details about this person with HIV, either. On and on it goes in white, suburban, middle-class Orange Country throughout the 48 Hours program. Only one young man with HIV says he's gay. The others either tell 48 Hours they don't know how they got the viru s or they don't say even that much. And, of course, 48 Hours doesn't ask. Because the wrong answers could ruin the premise of the whole show. AIDS, after all, is \"The Killer Next Door.\" Andrew Heyward was then the executive producer of 4 8 Hours. I told him I thought he put the show on for just one reason: ratings. He was annoyed and said something like, \"I. can't b elieve you think I would do that.\" Of course I think he would do that. In the old days, hour-long CBS News programs, like CBS Reports, tackled the big issues of our times, and producers were not expecte d to get big ratings. The men who started up the networks in the earliest days of television thought news was special. They made their money on Lucy and Ricky an d Jackie Gleason and Jack Benny. For years and years, news wasn't a money-mak er and wasn't expected to be. Don Hewitt, the creator and executive producer of 6 0 Minutes, loves to tell the story about how, when the show first went on the ai r, Bill Paley, the founder of CBS, told him, \"Make us proud!\" \"Now,\" Hewitt says, \"they tell us: Make us money!\" It's ironic that 60 Minutes, far and away the best of all the news mag-azine shows, indirectly is responsible for the \"infotainm ent\" we see on prime-time magazine programs today. 60 Minutes started out to do good - and it also did quite well. It made the network a not-so-small for- tune over the years. When the corporate executives realized news could actually m ake money, all bets were off. In the 1970s, Dick Salant, perhaps the most revered president in all of CBS News's long history, came back to the Broadcast Cen ter from a meeting across town at Black Rock, the CBS corporate headquarters in Manhattan, and told his top staff, \"I have good news and bad news; what do you want to hear first?\" \"Give us the good news first,\" someone said.  ;, \"The good news is that CBS News last quarter [thank s to 60 Minutes] made money for the first time ever.\" \"What's the bad news?\" someone else asked. \"The bad news is that CBS News made money for the f irst time ever.\" , Salant knew. They all knew. If news could actually make mo ney, the suits who ran the network would expect just that. Sure they would wan t quality, in theory. But"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"they wanted ratings and money, in fact. It took a while but along came 20/20 and 48 Hours a nd Dateline and a million others that didn't last.

Ther e were 20/20 clones. Even 60 Minutes got cloned. So if Andrew Heyward didn't get ratings for 48 Hour s and didn't make the network money, they'd cancel it. He knew it, and he lived w ith that sword hanging over his head every single week. When the geniuses at CB S in Hollywood were about to cancel 48 Hours in its infancy in the early 1990s, Heyward convinced them to give die show a new time slot. \"If we don't survive in the new slot,\" he told them, \"cancel us.\" The deal with the devil had been struck. The first week in the new time slot, Heyward broadcast \"Spring Break,\" one of the most h umili-ating shows 48 Hours has ever put on the air. There was no point to it, except to show beautiful coeds in skimpy bikinis hanging out on the beach in Fort Lauderdale. There was a lot of chitchat about sex and beer and that, pretty much, was that. \"Spring Break\" got one of the highest ratings in th e entire history of 48 Hours.

So, do I believe my good friend Andrew Heyward woul d put on a scary program whose primary goal was to get high ratings even if it meant telling half-truths about who was getting AIDS in America and how they were getting it? In a word, Yes! To make matters worse, Heyward let a gay man who wa s dying of AIDS produce \"The Killer Next Door.” I’m not saying he wasn't capa-bl e of being objective, just that he wasn't. \"If you want to give Rob a going-away present,\" I t old Heyward, \"you ought to do it on your own time.\" I knew it sounded cold, but I believed it was true. Heyward wanted blond-haired, blue-eyed people with HIV on his program for his ow n reasons - ratings! This particular producer was more than willing to delive r, for his own reasons. He wanted to scare America into believing that AIDS re ally was menacing white, suburban, middle-class commu-nities; to enlist whit e, suburban, middle-class Americans in a war to wake up the Republican politi cians in Washington, whom the AIDS lobby blamed for doing nothing to wipe out the disease. I told Heyward that given the overwhelming slant to the program, I wanted to do a story for the show that explored the other side, the side that questioned whether AIDS really was \"The Killer Next Door.\" I t old him I wanted to interview several people, including Randy Shilts, the best-in formed journalist on AIDS in all of America. Heyward said okay. So I flew off to San Francisco t o meet Shilts, who had written the brilliant book And the Band Played On, a devastat-ing history of neglect on the part of our government and the medic al establishment in the early years of the AIDS epidemic. Randy Shilts was gay hi mself. Shilts and I spoke in a beautiful park overlooking San Francisco. People were throwing Frisbees and sunbathing, and we were talki ng about the virus that was ravaging his city - and how the media were handling it."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"\"Why did so many reporters run with the heterosexua l AIDS story?\" I asked him. \"This was a new angle on the story,\" he said, \"and we need some-thing that brings the story home to most of our readers. Most of our readers or viewers are going to be heterosexuals. I think that there were some crasser considerations. If you want to sell newspapers or get peo-ple to wa tch your show, you want to say, 'This is a threat to you, too.'\" Shilts knew the real story and he wasn't afraid to tell it. We walked through gay neighborhoods in San Francisco, and he pointed to houses where friends had lived and died. He cared deeply about all of them. But he didn't let his compassion stand in the way of his journalism. Randy Shilts knew that AIDS was not really \"The Kil ler Next Door,\" not the way we were playing it, anyway. It was \"The Killer Next Door\" in his neighborhood - but not in all of our neighborhoods. \"A lot of heterosexuals are looking down their cul- de-sacs and seeing that the Grim Reaper is not walking down their tree-lined st reets,\" he told me. \"There was a profound frustration among AIDS activists and among AIDS researchers that the only time the media seemed to pay attention to AIDS, the only time the government seemed to do anything about AIDS, was wh en it appeared that it would affect heterosexuals.\" So the activists did what they felt they had to do. They got the word out that it would spread to all of us. And the media passed it along to America, at first because they didn't know better, then because they thought heterosexual AIDS was a better story, but eventually because it was anoth er way to show compassion. So we showed people with AIDS on television and nev er bothered to say they were gay. We showed straight suburbanites with AIDS and never bothered to ask if they shot drugs\\into their veins or had sex with people who did. Even before \"The Killer Next Door/' aired, there wa s a buzz around the 48 Hours shop about the story I had covered. The producer I worked with, Liza McGuirk, who is one of the best in the business, told me tha t some of our colleagues were not at all happy. While every-one else was going al ong with the program, reporting about AIDS in middle-class, heterosexual America, Liza and I were saying \"not so fast,\" the Grim Reaper was not walki ng down those tree-lined sub-urban streets. \"How could you have done that':\"' a 48 Hours staffe r asked Liza in that annoying, whiny tone that suggests that you - someo ne as decent and sensitive as you, Liza! - should know better. They were disap-po inted that Liza McGuirk, who was well liked and respected, would lake part in a story that didn't toe the party line on AIDS. Some of the producers who were gay were downright angry - and they let Liza know it. For whatever reason, the y didn't confront me directly, which was probably a good idea all the wa y around. Randy Shilts died one year and ten months after I i nterviewed him on that clear, crisp, beautiful day in San Francisco. He died of A IDS, just like HO many of his friends before him. Randy Shilts didn't tell any of us that lie had the disease when we spoke. Yet he was brave enough to tell the truth. He was courageous enough to say that despite what the media were tell ing America, AIDS was not \"The Killer Next Door.\" Not the way we were suggest ing, anyway. If Randy Shilts could be that honest, why can't the rest of us? \"I Thought Our Job Was to Tell the Truth\""},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"In 1995, the state of Alabama decided to go back to the future. Apparently, they had a failure to communicate down there. Some priso n inmates weren't following the rules, so the people in charge decided to make clear what exactly the relationship was between crime and punishment in th e great state of Alabama. Which is why they resurrected the old chain gang. B efore Alabama decided to send a message to its criminals, the only place you coul d find a chain gang was in the classic movie section at Blockbuster. In real l ife, chain gangs had been abolished a long time ago. Taking prisoners in chai ns out in the fields, putting them under the hot sun, and making them work while guards with shotguns kept a close eye on them in some circles was considered a throwback to a less enlightened time in America. Which is exactly what made it such a good story. It 's also what sent the politically correct, sensitive, liberal producers w ho ran the CBS Evening News with Dan Rather into a New York City tizzy. The evening news sent Larry Doyle, who was based in Miami, to Alabama to produce the story. Doyle is an ex-marine captain who jumped out of helicopters in Vietnam. He's a tough, no-nonsense guy who thinks M arlboros and Heineken are two of the essential food groups. And he's one of the b est hard news producers at CBS or any of the networks. Doyle hooked up with a CBS News reporter named Dian a Gonzalez and together they flew off to Alabama. There was an old joke at the t ime about how pilots would come on the PA system as the plane left Florida air space and tell the passengers, \"We've just crossed into Alabama; set y our watches back - one hundred years.\" It was cheap but not com-pletely un founded. From the airport in Montgomery, they drove to a far m in rural Alabama, where the prison officials were waiting for their arrival. Ov er the years, certainly during the dark, nasty days of the civil rights mar ches, reporters from places like CBS News were about as welcome in Alabama as a black woman determined to sit in the front of the bus. But not today. Today the people who ran the farm we re glad to see Doyle and Gonzalez. They were proud of their chain gang and d idn't care one bit if the whole world knew about it. So they gave the CBS cam era crew the green light to shoot a chain gang, which was made up of twenty con victs, shackled at the ankles in groups of five, doing vari-ous chores on the far m. (In Alabama, the chain gang wasn't for every-body, just special cases - re peat offenders and troublemakers.) Doyle remembers it was a typical summer afternoon i n Alabama - real hot and real humid. You could see the heat waves coming off the country roads, he told me. The convicts, who were breaking rocks and tilling s oil and doing other odd jobs around the farm, predictably were not happy. \"This makes you hate,\" one of them told Diana, whil e looking straight at the CBS News camera. \"It makes you led like a slave,\" .said a third. Doyle and Gonzalez also got an interview with the b iggest backer of the chain gang in the entire state of Alabama, Governor Fob J ames. \"In Alabama, if you break the law, and if you assau lt people, hurt peo-ple, rape and rob, you're gonna wind up in the chain gang,\" i s how the governor put it. And then, as if we didn't know, he added, \"I like t hat.\" TV producers are the equivalent of newspaper editor s, so Doyle matched Diana"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Gonzalez's script with pictures of the chain gang, super-vised the videotape editing of the story, and then sent it via satellit e to New York. It aired on the evening news. And that, Doyle figured, was that . Until the next day, when he got a call from Al Berm an, one of the senior producers on the CBS Evening News. It seems that Do yle hadn't bothered to \"warn\" the senior producers that all but one of the men in the chain gang were black. It wasn't an issue as far as Doyle was concerned. H e covered the story that was there, edited it, and sent the videotape to New Yor k. The first time the CBS Evening News senior producers realized the chain ga ng was almost all black was when they watched the story come off the satellite. It was right before airtime and by then it was too late to do any-thing but put the story on television. \"Was that a representative sample of the prisoners? \" Berman wanted to know. \"Yes, it was,\" Doyle said. \"Was it a fair portrayal of who the prisoners were? \" Berman went on. \"Yeah.\" \"Well, we have to be more careful next time,\" Doyle recalls Berman telling him. \"We don't want to give the impression that the only pris-oners down there are black. One of the things I like best about Larry Doyle is that he has virtu-ally no tolerance for bullshit. He's a tough guy, in the He mingway mold, who could tell great stories about hot spots he's covered all over the world. He is intelligent and funny and always a straight shooter. You know w here you stand with Larry Doyle. And Al Herman was about to find out where he stood with Larry Doyle. This conversation on the phone was setting off Doyle's b ullshit detector. Doyle was getting annoyed as he listened to this le cture, coming from one of the New York producers, a group (at least as far as I'm con-cerned) not known for its sophistication when it comes to things like lif e in Alabama. Or like life anyplace outside the Upper West Side of Manhattan, for that matter. This was a group that would rather vacation on the dark side of the moon than so much as set foot in a place as unappealing and unso phis-ticated (to them anyway!\") as Alabama, where they might have to come into contact with - it was too painful to say - Alabamians!, some of whom actu ally might not have attended college in the Northeast - or anyplace else - and w here you probably couldn't even get the early edi-tion of the New York Times. \"I shot what was there,\" Doyle told Berman, an edge creeping into his voice. Berman told Doyle to be more careful next time. To get more pictures of white criminals next time. The conversation was idiotic as far as Larry Doyle was concerned. There was just one white criminal! What was he supposed to do? Thi s was Alabama, for crissake, not fucking Switzerland! The talk wasn't going anywhere; Doyle wanted to go. He had had enough of Al Berman. Doyle was no bigot, and he didn't like the impli-cation that he was. So he ended the call with a witty and sophisticated pl easantry that Noel Coward himself would have envied. \"Fuck off,\" Doyle explained. Al Berman isn't a bad guy. He was just trying to be compassionate. And since race in America is the wound that never seems to he al, sen-sitivity isn't a bad thing. But what if journalistic sensitivity had led Berman and the other CBS Evening"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"News senior producers down a different road? \"Are the Alabama authorities unfairly rounding up b lack men?\" they could have asked. \"Are they convicting black men of crimes that white men don't get convicted of, maybe don't even get arrested for?\" they could have asked. \"Are the authorities labeling black convicts 'troub lemakers' in order to funnel them onto the chain gang - simply because they are black? Is that why the ratio on the chain gang was about nineteen to one?\" If any of the answers had been \"yes,\" it would have made a great story, which also might have done some real good. But to get the facts for a story like that would be hard, time-consuming, expensive work. The CBS Evening News in New York didn't send Doyle to Alabama to spend money and tim e. He was there to get a good picture story, fast. \"Convicts in chains\" is what they sent him to Alaba ma to get. For sound bites, he was supposed to round up the usual suspects: the gov-ernor giving the pros of the chain gang, the cons giving the cons. Image is what the TV producers in New York were con cerned about. Let's not make it look like it really is. That might cause prob-le ms. That might make us look insensitive and short on compassion. Distort the images. If those black men in Alabama w ere actually being railroaded simply because of their race, let someone else, wit h more time and money, worry about that. Being compassionate in televi-sion news these days means never having to get your hands dirty. Instead of manipulating the images and then convinc ing ourselves that we were sensitive and therefore had actually accomplished s ome-thing, we should have been looking at race and sensitivity in a totally d ifferent way. If being sensitive and trying to accomplish something was th e goal, we should have been expanding our Rolodex files to include more black p eople. We should have put more black environmentalists in our stories, and more black scientists, arid more black businessmen and women. We should have put black people in our stories to talk about a whole range o f issues besides race, which is about the only thing we let black people talk ab out on television (except for sports). That would get black Americans on national television in a positive light, and it would be a lot more honest than simpl y using de facto racial quotas to make sure we put enough white criminals o n the air to balance the number of black criminals we were showing. But in the hands of journalism's ayatollahs of poli tical correctness, even a well-intentioned goal to get more minorities in new s stories, in a positive light, can get downright silly. Brill's Content, in 1999, told a story about the Ga nnett newspaper chain's policy that requires reporters at all seventy-five Gannett papers to include minority sources in all their stories. Jennifer Greenstein, who wrote the piece, tells abo ut a reporter at ; Gannett's Greenville News in South Carolina who spent hours h unting for a black person to include in a story about... Hanukkah food! Religiou s minorities don't count with Gannett, so the reporter had to find someone who wa s both Jewish and a racial minority. Too bad Sammy Davis Jr. is dead. \"I couldn't find any Ethiopian Jews,\" the reporter is quoted as say-ing. \"I called the synagogue and asked if they had any Afri can Jews. They said no.\""},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"What a surprise. No African Jews living in Greenvil le, South Carolina. The same reporter spent a good part of another day trying to find a nonwhite person to quote in a story on gourmet dog biscuits, a subject that cries out for minority expertise. Another reporter at the same Greenville News estima tes he \"made an extra thirty phone calls\" before he found an Asian astronomer in Utah for a story about a solar eclipse. A Japanese woman who lives in Greenville was quoted three times in thirteen days, telling the paper's readers what she thought about a local jogging path (\"It's inspiring to me\"), about the importance of c hanging an area rug each season (\"It's very important to respect the seasons \"), and about an upcoming Elton John concert (\"I think it's a good follow-up after Janet Jackson\"). \"Never mind,\" Ms. Greenstein tells us, \"that [the J apanese source] isn't an Elton John fan, and doesn't have any particular exp ertise on jogging or area rugs. She fit the bill.\" Translation: she wasn't wh ite. \"It's hard to quarrel with the goal,\" Ms. Greenstei n points out. And she's right. A policy that gives minorities an opportunit y to air their views about something other than being minorities is a pretty g ood idea. A little more common sense, when it comes to stories about Hanukk ah food, would make it a great idea. A few months after the chain gang incident, in Sept ember 1995, Larry Doyle was in St. Thomas, in the Virgin Islands, covering Hurr icane Marilyn. Looting had become a problem, and Doyle and his camera crew wer e right there on a downtown street when the police rounded up some looters and hauled them off to jail. As Yogi Berra might have put it, it was deja vu all over again. At CBS News in New York, weekend news producers wer e watching Doyle's story come in off the satellite, and one of them didn't like w hat she was seeing. According to Doyle, Raylena Fields complained to th e others that all the looters in Doyle's piece were black. So was she. Apparently , she didn't like the idea that CBS News would put those pictures on the air. So she let the senior producers know how she felt. Such an expression of concern carries a lot of weig ht in network newsrooms. White producers are very sensitive to what black c ol-leagues feel. Partly because white news people understand that they can' t see things in quite the same way that black journalists can and partly beca use they don't want to be seen as racists. Michael Janeway, the former editor in chief of the Boston Globe, writes about this practice - newsroom monitors keeping an eye ou t for stories that might offend. In his book Republic of Denial, Janeway say s, \"Suddenly newsrooms had de facto caucuses organized by gender, race, and ethni city. Suddenly coverage of controversial stories had to be negotiated within t he newsroom as well as outside.\" Which is what was happening with the looting episod e in Doyle's hurricane story. Fields had made her case in New York, and now her c oncerns were being passed on to Doyle in the Virgin Islands. He didn't like the implication one bit, that maybe the looting shots didn't bother him because he wasn't as sensitive as they t hought he should be- - or worse, that he was some kind of bigot. \"It's not every day you're accused of being a racis t,\" he told me years later."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"\"Yes,\" he told the New York producers by phone, \"th e looters are black. And so are the cops who arrested them. And so is 95 percen t of the island!\" Fields doesn't dispute the basic facts, but she tol d me that what both-ered her about the pictures was the implication that the loo ting was widespread, that it was happening all over the island in the aftermath of the storm. In fact, she said, looting was \"minor\" and \"very limited.\" The p ictures, in her view, placed high up in the story, and the words that went along with them, were misleading, and that's why she objected. It's a seductive argument. But what if the hurrican e had blown through Naples, Florida, instead of the Virgin Islands, and the \"mi nor\" and \"very limited\" looting was the work of young white men? Would Rayl ena Fields and the other producers in New York have shown the same concern a bout the impression those pictures might leave? After all, it wasn't wide-spr ead - and most young white men in Naples aren't looters. Most white businessmen aren't criminals, either, bu t TV producers don't hesitate to show the few who are being led off in handcuffs for allegedly manipulating the stock market. Most deadbeat dads aren't rich do ctors, but we put them on the air every chance we get if they're being marched of f to jail for failing to pay child support. It's called news. And so is looting after a hurrica ne. Even if it is \"minor\" and \"very limited,\" and, yes, even if the looters are b lack. I understand that in this country there is an ugly history that involves race, which is different from anything else in our past. I understand that putting white businessmen and rich doctors on TV in a bad l ight doesn't reflect on all white businessmen or all rich doctors. But putting black looters on TV doesn't reflect on all black people, either. The only peo-p le who think it does are either stupid or racist. I don't think we should be making news decisions based on those two groups of losers. It's true that once in our not-too-distant past, journalists, like many Americans, weren't sensitive enough about race, and we came away with nasty stereotypes about black people . But the pendulum has taken a long, long swing over the years. Now we have deba tes and seminars in the newsroom about whether it's proper to show black po lice arresting a few black looters in a predominantly black country. The hurricane story ran, but Raylena Fields had pre vailed on her sensitive colleagues, who took out the looting shot. Journali stically, this was questionable, at best. But journalism wasn't the on ly issue on the table. Satisfying a black colleague - and rectifying three hundred or four hundred years of American Racial Sin - was also a considera tion. \"I thought our job was to tell the truth,\" Doyle to ld me. Apparently, it's not that simple, because reporters and producers in the field got the same song and dance from the Sensitivity Pa trol in New York over and over again. Andy Triay, a producer in the Miami bureau of CBS N ews, was cov-ering a story about two white men who were accused of abducting a black man near Tampa, Florida, and forcing him at gunpoint to drive to a remote field, where they doused him with gasoline and set him on fire. In the script, which Triay e-mailed to his bosses a t the CBS Evening News, the victim was described as \"a black man.\" A senior pro ducer told Triay to change the description from \"black\" to \"African-American,\" the term considered more"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"progressive in some circles. This may seem harmless enough... except for one thi ng. \"The vic-tim isn't American,\" Triay told the producer. \"He's from Jama ica, in the Caribbean.\" That, one might reasonably conclude, would have bee n the end of the matter. But it wasn't. \"Change it to African-American or the st ory doesn't get on the air,\" she told Triay. He made the change, knowing it was wrong, and later Andy told me, \"Everyone involved in that matter knew that if we called him African-American we would be factually incorrect. But to get the story on the ai r, we had to do it.\" Maybe it was no big deal. The world didn't come to an end. Nor did it come to an end when producers in New York complained, as they often did, that prison stories showed too many black inmates and not enoug h white ones. Even though in some parts of the country, espe-cially in the South , the prison population is heavily black. Being sensitive is not a bad thing, and being conce rned about how people are portrayed is no small matter, either. But this sens itivity, it seems to me, stems from something deeper and more complicated th an plain old-fashioned decency. The liberal media elites are not some alien species . They're part of the bigger liberal community - a community, according to the b rilliant author and scholar Shelby Steele, that has been on a journey for some time now, a journey to redemption from racial guilt. \"I think that white guilt, in its broad sense, spri ngs from a knowledge of ill-gotten advantage,\" Steele, who is black, writes in The Content of Our Character, his powerful book about race in America. \"More precisely, it comes from the juxtaposition of this knowledge with the i nevitable gratitude one feels for being white rather than black in America.\" This same guilt, maybe also this gratitude for bein g white rather than black in America, I believe, is what drives many white media elites to obsess about such things as the number of blacks we show on the chain gang. Or to make sure we don't call a black man from the Caribbean \"black\" b ut \"African-American,\" because somehow we think that title bestows more re spect. Or to shy away from showing black looters on an island populated overwh elmingly by black people. This business of playing with the images and being ultrasensitive to what we label people is not about actually doing good. If d oing good were what it was about, we'd spend lots of money investigating why s o many blacks wind up on the chain gang. That might really accomplish something. When you get right down to it, this compassion wasn't for the downtrodden at a ll. It was for us. All this concern wasn't about injustices. It was about feeli ng better about ourselves - and making as little personal sacrifice as possible . I once suggested to Andrew Heyward that there was a foolproof way to change the racial power structure in America - not in ten or t wenty years, but literally overnight. \"Effective right now,\" I said, \"you and every other white male high-level executive in America should voluntarily give up you r jobs - on one condition: that you be replaced by a qualified woman or member of a minority group starting tomorrow morning. The face of corporate America wou ld immediately change. Whaddaya think?\" The king was not amused. Andrew Heyward did not lik e the idea. Not one bit. That"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"would have cost him something, and that's not how t he game works. But making sure we call Jamaicans \"African-American\" instead o f \"black\" and making sure we limit the number of black criminals we put on the T V screen cost Heyward and the other media elites nothing - and that's just how th ey like it. Redemption for America's - and the media's - deplor able racial his-tory never came so cheap. They love affirmative action, as long as their own kids get into Ivy League schools. They love handing out jobs based on racial preferences, as long as they get to keep theirs. It's a great deal: it's always somebody else who has to make the sacrifice - sometimes Asian-American kids, some times other white students who don't get into places like Harvard and Yale and Princeton - while the white liberal elites get to claim credit for being so dec ent, the saviors of black people in America. \"What the liberal really wants is to bring about ch ange which will not in any way endanger his position,\" is how Stokely Carmicha el once put it. So in the end, the liberals who command the highest positions among the media elites are not generous at all. They're quite selfi sh, really. They distort images not to ease the pain of oppressed black Amer icans, but to ease their own pain, to make themselves feel less guilty, and, mos t important, to prove how good and caring they are. As long as there are victims in America, real or ot herwise, and as long as there are self-centered, guilt-ridden reporters and edito rs, the Me Decade will never end. How About a Media That Reflects America? The News Mafia was all over me, and no one with any brains was taking bets that I would survive. Dan Rather made sure I was kept of f the air (or off his evening newscast anyway), which is death to a television re porter. Peter Johnson, who writes a TV column in USA Today - and who would bre ak his nose on Dan's behind if the anchorman ever stopped quickly - wrote that many of my colleagues dismissed me as \"dead wrong, an ingrate, a nut, or all of the above.\" And that was the good news! The bad news was that the anti-Christ, Rush Limbaug h, and the other conservative elites, had come riding to my defense. I would have been a lot better off if Saddam Hussein, O. J. Simpson, and Charles Manson h ad held a joint news conference to tell the world what a great guy I was . Limbaugh read my Wall Street Journal column on his radio program, which went out to millions of Americans who didn't trust the big-t ime media long before I threw my two cents into the debate. Rush, pre-dictably, a greed with every word. So did his callers. At the time, Limbaugh also had a syndicated televis ion show, and one night he devoted a long segment (six minutes and twenty-seve n seconds) to what he saw as monumental hypocrisy on the part of CBS News. This is a business, he told his audience, \"that see ks whistle-blowers out; they love dirty little secrets.\" Limbaugh said I was in trouble for nothing more tha n \"calling it like it is.\" \"Here's a guy who says what I would venture 70 perc ent of the American people agree with - that the press is liberal - and he's i n huge trouble.\" Yes, and it got a lot huger after Limbaugh's testim onial."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"\"Rather is furious,\" Heyward told me. Whether he wa tched the TV show or heard the radio version or someone told him about one or the other, I don't know. It didn't matter. Limbaugh was on my side, and, as mad as Rather was before, he was a lot madder now. Getting support from Rush Limbaugh comes with a lot of baggage. Two years earlier, Jeffrey Goodell wrote in Elle magazine abo ut Limbaugh's support for another journalist, Emily Rooney (Andy's daughter), who had been pushed out the door at ABC News. \"This afternoon it's not the pressure of the job th at's getting to [now-fired World News Tonight executive producer Emily] Rooney ,\" Goodell wrote. \"It's Rush Limbaugh. Limbaugh read from a story in TV Guide... in which Rooney gently chastises the media for its liberal vision. It's th e truth, of course - media executives know it, correspon-dents know it, and th e viewers out in TV-land know it. But for a televi-sion executive to come out and say it is a real no-no, a violation of clan rules. And to have Limbaugh on yo ur side - what could be worse? Within the liberal orthodoxy of ABC News, be ing championed by Rush Limbaugh is akin to being seen huddling with a chil d molester.\" I didn't want to become a darling of conservatives. Sure, I was a critic of the networks' leftward tilt just as they were, but I wa sn't part of some right-wing cabal, no matter how many times Dan Rather implied it. The fact is, I would have loved to get some support from the Left, from people like Frank Rich of the New York Times, and Jonathan Alter of Newsweek, and Ellen Goodman of the Boston Globe. But nothing I said in the Wall Street Journal piqued their interest in the least. I would have been thrilled if New York Times column ist Anthony Lewis, who is so very sensitive to all sorts of \"chilling effects,\" had shown just a little sensitivity to the plight of a reporter whose job w as hanging by a thread because he wasn't diplomatic, because he actually h ad the nerve to publicly express an unpopular view about - oh my God! - the press. I guess I was naive, but I thought liberals should be concerned about that kind of \"chilling effect\" too. But they weren't. Liberals in the media - who would have come down wi th the vapors if a conservative CEO had so much as given a reporter a dirty look - didn't flinch when CBS News executives took me off the air and su g-gested I might be fired because they saw me as a whistle-blower, which, the best I could figure, made me the first whistle-blower in history who wasn't turn ed into a national hero by the media. If I had worked at Firestone and blown the whistle on defective tires, 60 Minutes would have immortalized me. Lesley Stahl wo uld have por-trayed me as the courageous David going up against the corporate Gol iath and would have lobbied Congress to make my birthday a national holiday. Unfortunately, the defective product I was making n oise about wasn't tires; it was network news. Andrew Heyward even told me that Don Hewitt, who had put more whistle-blowers on the air than anyone in broadcast ing history, said, \"I don't want him [Goldberg] anywhere on the ninth floor,\" w here 60 Minutes is located at CBS News in New York. One of my few remaining friends on the CBS Evening News, a young producer named Mitch Weitzrier, who didn't approve of what I had d one or how I had done it, told me that writing the op-ed \"wasn't courageous. It was stupid.\""},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"\"What do you think would have happened to you if yo u worked at IBM and did something like this?\" Technically it was a question , but Mitch was really making a statement, not just about the wisdom, but about t he morality of airing your own company's dirty laundry in public. All I could say was, \"But this isn't IBM. Or General Motors. They don't look down everybody's throat for a living. This is CBS News. We do. And that makes all the difference in the world.\" In the midst of all this, only one important journa list who was not a member of the vast right-wing conspiracy weighed in with even indirect support. Michael Gartner, the former newspaper editor, Pulitzer Priz e winner, and past president of NBC News, wrote about my situation in his USA To day column. \"The issue is important,\" Gartner wrote, \"and Heywa rd could use it to make CBS a journalistic leader. Whatever he may think of Gold- berg's broadside, he publicly should embrace his reporter, say that he's glad CBS journalists care about fairness, and declare that the contro-versy should raise the network's consciousness about fairness. \"CBS could lead the way. It might be painful, but p eople would notice. Heyward and Goldberg could change the business. And it migh t even unmire them from third place....Taking sides isn't good journalism. Taking care is.\" Andrew Heyward never said a word to me about Gartne r's friendly advice. All I know is that he didn't take it. The New York Post, a conservative paper, came to my defense. In an edi-torial headlined \"Blowing the Whistle on CBS News,\" the Po st said, \"CBS News, which prides itself on its bold willingness to expose the dark secrets of corporate America, has apparently discovered that the truth h urts. \"CBS is working itself into a state of high dudgeon over Goldberg's decision to go public with his views,\" the Pout went on. Evenin g News anchor Dan Rather 'deplores' the whole situation. CBS News president Andrew Heyward is said to be livid. No one, however, appears ready to dispute th e details in which Goldberg's analysis is grounded. \"We can sympathize with the suggestion that trust w ithin a company is undermined when isolated individuals bare dirty linen in publi c. But it comes with little grace for CBS News to take refuge in this line of a rgument. After all, many Americans were introduced to the concept of corpora te 'whistle-blowers' by CBS journalists.\" And die Post concluded, \"It's worth remembering tha t whistle-blowers can tell all kinds of truths. And it's just as important for the American people to understand how bias taints the news disseminated by the major networks as it is for them to grasp the alleged inner work-ings of to bacco companies.\" Cal Thomas, the conservative syndicated columnist, wrote, \"CBS News correspondent Bernard Goldberg... has blown what co ver remains on the contention that the networks are fair, balanced, and unbiased....Goldberg provided a rare glimpse from t he inside. It will be interesting to see if he's allowed to keep his job now that the dirty little secret is finally out.\" I was wondering the exact same thing. At about 12:20 in the afternoon on February 21, 199 6, eight days after the op-ed came out, I spoke by phone with Jon Klein, the exec utive vice president of CBS News and Heyward's number two in command. \"Is CBS News going to fire me?\" I asked him point-b lank."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"\"If we wanted to fire you,\" Klein said, \"we would h ave fired you the day die Wall Street Journal piece ran.\" This was the first indication dial perhaps I might survive. Klein, in his forties, is an Ivy Leaguer, a graduat e of Brown. He's very smart, but, like a lot of TV executives, he's someone you wouldn't want to turn your back on. Jon is on the small, thin side, wears eyeg lasses, and comes off as a cross between a well-dressed Woody Allen... and Mac hiavelli. He's very creative, but at CBS News he had a reputation as the kind of guy who thought people who tell the truth do it mainly because they lack imagi nation. So when he hinted that I might survive, I was skept ical. If CBS had done that - fired me the day the WSF piece came out - I told Kl ein, it would have touched off a major battle CBS News didn't need. \"Can you imagine the headlines?\" I said. '\"The Hous e That Murrow Built Fires Correspondent for Taking on Bias in the News.'\" I w as talk-ing with far more confidence than I actually had. \"CBS News Unloads R enegade Correspondent,\" was more like it. \"If CBS News had fired me the day the op-ed piece c ame out,\" I told Klein, \"it would have been a public relations disaster.\" After all, millions of Americans agree with me, I told him. Once you leave Manhattan , you hear all the time about how biased the big, national media are. I was whist ling past the graveyard. Klein was calm and matter-of-fact. I've never known him to get rat-tled. So he first reminded me that by writing the op-ed piece I had vio-lated my contract, which says that CBS News journalists had to get pri or approval before submitting articles for publication. Technically, CBS News cou ld have fired me for that and that alone, he said, and technically I guess he was right. But I reminded him that others, includ-ing Dan Rather, had written con troversial op-ed pieces without getting approval, and nothing ever happened to any of them. Good point, I thought, but I knew it wasn't good en ough to save me if that's what it came down to. I also knew that the United States Constitution was n't going to save me, either. I understood that I had no First Amendment, free-sp eech rights. The First Amendment prohibits only government from telling us what we can and can't say. Corporations are not democracies. Nor should they b e. They're more like dictatorships, when you get right down to it - som e run by benevolent dictators, some by not-so-benevolent dictators. But these dictators - bosses, managers, whatever you want to call them - have bu sinesses to run, and they can pretty much fire the hired help for almost any reas on beyond race, color, and creed type of stuff. They can send employees packin g for saying they like sunny days or corn flakes or anything else. CBS News sure could have fired me for accusing the media elites of slanting the news. But what about what constitutional scholars like Ha rvard professor Alan Dershowitz have called \"the spirit of free speech\"? John Rocker, the Atlanta Braves pitcher, didn't hav e any free-speech rights to say the subway ride to Shea Stadium in New York was like driving through Beirut... or to describe the passengers as \"some ki d with purple hair, next to some queer with AIDS, right next to some dude who j ust got out of jail for the fourth time, right next to some twenty-year-old mom with four kids.\" In terms of keeping his job, he had no free-speech right to say, \"The biggest thing I don't like about New York are the foreigner s.\" The gov-ernment couldn't"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"shut him up - but the Braves sure could. They could have unloaded Rocker in less time than it takes his fastball to reach home plate . But in a New York Times op-ed, Dershowitz pointed o ut, \"The Constitution may impose limits only on the government, but the First Amendment is premised on the idea that there should be a free mar-ketplace of id eas. Private universities, for example, are not constrained by the Constitutio n, but most choose to follow it anyway, because they recognize that the exchange of ideas - no matter how wrongheaded or obnoxious - is good for education.\" You'd think the media would look at it the same way . In my case, which came a few years before Rocker, w ouldn't it have been just a tad hypocritical for CBS News, which is allowed to say unpopular things about any subject under the sun precisely because of the First Amendment, to fire me for expressing my own \"unpopular\" views? But Klein let me know that if I became a sympathetic character at CBS News's expense, if I encouraged writers to support me, the company would use \"all the big guns in its arsenal\" against me. \"All the big guns in its arsenal!\" What the hell di d that mean? That's what Carlo Gambino says to Crazy Joey Gallo. But there w as no rancor in Jon's voice. None. It was simply a friendly piece of advice. Kle in, of course, was talking about a public relations arsenal. CBS, like all big com-panies, has people on the payroll who do things like that. They could pla nt stories with friendly newspaper writers about how I had to go because no one would work with me in the wake of the op-ed column, or, who knows, maybe that I was \"a political activist with a political agenda.\" \"That's how corporations do things,\" Klein said, no nchalantly. \"You know that.\" Forget the Gambinos and the Gallos - forget the Sop ranos - this was the stuff of the Corleones. Mario Puzo was writing the script; J on Klein was merely delivering it. Jon was Al Pacino playing Michael. T he calm one. The smart one. The one who, like Klein, was an Ivy League guy. The one who, when push came to shove, would have his own brother knocked off. Only a fool wouldn't get Klein's message: You hurt us... and we hurt you. A hundred times over. We use all the big guns in the arsenal to hurt you. I understood this was nothing personal. Just busine ss. Not long after the op-ed was published, Andrew Heyw ard called me at home in Miami, where I was spending most of my days since I had no job to go to, and summoned me to his office in New York. We met late in the afternoon. Jon Klein was there. \"Will you apologize In the entire staff of CBS News ?\" Heyward asked. \"No, I will not,\" I told him. I would be willing to apologize to Engberg \"if I hurt his feelings.\" But that was it. I was sticking by what I wrote. To his credit, Heyward didn't push the issue; he di dn't make a company-wide apology a condition for me to keep my job. A few weeks later I did apologize to Engberg, in a note, saying my intent was never to hurt him or his family or his friends in t he Washington bureau of CBS News. And if I did, I said, I was sorry. But the is sue, I made clear, was journalism. \"Someday, soon I hope, I will stop bein g the issue,\" I wrote Engberg. \"I do think it's convenient for some to fo cus attention on the messenger - why not? - it conveniently deflects att ention from the message. Someday I hope serious people will discuss the seri ous point I made. Some will agree; others won't. That's OK. But the issue shoul d never be that 'Goldberg"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"launched a personal attack on Engberg.'... My point was about journalism and I stand by it. It was never about personalities or pe rsonal shots.\" Engberg, whose last words to me had been \"You're fu ll of shit,\" never responded to my apology. Not to me, anyway. But he did contac t my boss and his, Andrew Heyward, to say that he would not accept this or an y other \"self-serving\" apology, so long as I continued to stand by what I had written in the Wall Street Journal. The meeting in New York, with Heyward and Klein, di dn't last long. They offered no hints as to what they were going to do with me. But it looked like my problems weren't going away anytime soon. Because n ot only would I continue to stand by what I had written, I was more con-vinced than ever that I was right. They were all protesting entirely too much. A letter to Ann Landers was making its way around C BS News. \"Dear Ann: I have a problem. I have two brothers. O ne brother is in television, the other was put to death in the electric chair fo r murder. My mother died from insanity when I was three years old. My sisters are prostitutes, and my father sells narcotics to high school students. Recently I met a girl who was just released from a reformatory where she served time for smothering her illegitimate child to death, and I w ant to marry her. \"My problem is - if I marry this girl, should I tel l her about my brother who is in television?\" Not a bad question. The letter to Ann Landers is parody, of course. The interview Dan Rather gave Tom Snyder only sounds like parody. Rather doesn't believe there is a liberal bias in t he news. That's why he went on Tom Snyder's late-night TV show on February 8,19 95, and said, \"It's one of the great political myths, about press bias. Most r eporters don't know whether they're Republican or Democrat, and vote every whic h way.\" When Dan says something as breathtakingly goofy as that you have to wonder - is the boy just toying with us or does he really belie ve it? \"Most reporters don't know if they're Republican or Democrat\"? On what pl anet, Dan, would that be? \"... and vote every which way\"? I don't think so. T hey vote over-whelmingly Democratic. Could Dan Rather really be the only per son in the entire United States of America who doesn't know this? Most reporters, though, aren't as defensive as Dan. They take a more seductive position. Even if we are liberal, they say, so what ? As long as we keep our biases out of the stories we cover, what's the diff erence how we feel about abortion or gun control or anything else? They're right. Completely and totally 100 percent r ight. And per-haps on Planet Bizarro in some parallel universe their personal vi ews about life and the world really wouldn't matter. But they do here on Earth, because, even though some would take issue, reporters and edi-tors really are only human, which means they bring all their biases and life experiences to thei r stories. And it shows. Look at it this way: Imagine that almost all of the people who bring you the news on CBS and NBC and ABC voted for Richard Nixon over George McGovern, instead of the other way around. Imagine that they favored Ronald Reagan over Walter Mondale. Now imagine that the media elites a re mostly against affirmative action and mostly for the death penalty. Pretend th at most network journalists"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"are for prayer in the public schools and against a woman's right to have an abortion. Now make believe that they broadcast the news each night, not from Manhattan, the most liberal enclave in America (except maybe f or Hollywood and a few college towns), but from Omaha, Nebraska. Imagine, too, that their neighbors are not highly paid, sophisticated New Yorkers who, lik e the media elites, send their children to expen-sive private schools in Man hattan with the overwhelmingly white sons and daughters of other we althy, sophisticated New Yorkers - even as they bemoan how segregated by rac e and class America remains. Imagine instead that they send their kids to the Om aha public schools, where their children sit next to mostly middle-class boys and girls whose parents aren't big shots in the world of high finance and l aw and journalism, but mostly work in less glamorous jobs at Mutual of Omaha or a t the county courthouse or on a farm or maybe even at the hardware store. Do we really think that if the media elites worked out of Nebraska instead of New York, and if they were overwhelmingly social co nserva-tives instead of liberals, and if they overwhelmingly voted for Nixo n and Reagan instead of McGovern and Mondale... do we really think that wou ld make no difference? Does anyone really believe that the evening newscasts wo uld fundamentally be the same? Sure, they'd still cover tornadoes and plane crashe s pretty much the same way, but do we really think they'd cover abortion and af firmative action and gay rights the same way? Or would their conservatism, r einforced by their surroundings, their friends and neighbors, somehow - in some vague, subtle way - influence how they see the world and how they rep ort the news? Maybe these make-believe conservative journalists w ould be more open-minded if there were some diversity in their lives. So, just to make sure that we don't become too parochial out there on the plains, we wo uld make sure that we had racial, ethnic, and gender diversity at our new net work broadcast centers in Omaha. We would make sure that our news organizatio ns were populated not just with white male con-servatives but also with black male conservatives and Hispanic and Asian male conservatives and black and Hispanic and Asian women conservatives, too. Do we think that because we have this wonderful div ersity, this mag-nificent rainbow coalition, that we would get a less narrow, less biased, and more honest newscast? Why does it look so patently ridiculous, so obvious ly silly, when the tables are turned, when conservatives are in the majority? Why don't the people who run the networks in New York think it's just as ridicu-lous , just as silly, and just as harmful to have such a disproportionate number of l iberals, no matter what their color or gender or ethnic back-ground, giving us th e news each night? Does anyone think a \"diverse\" group of conservative journalists would give us the news straight? I sure as hell don't. They'd be just like the Left. Except, they'd let their conservative biases slip into the news, and they'd swear on a stack of Bibles that they were mainstream.. .just a s liberals do now. It's the human condition. Is it possible that conservative reporters just mig ht have a tendency to go to Phyllis Schlafly and other conservative women to ge t \"main-stream\" women's reactions to stories, instead of going to the women from NOW as liberals in the"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"media tend to do? Could it be that conservative journalists might not see any bias in describing liberal Democrats like Barney Frank or Dick Gephard t as \"bombastic and ruthless,\" the exact words that Eric Engberg used N ovember 2, 1994, to describe Newt Gingrich on Dan Rather's CBS Evening News? Do you think there might be more stories about reli gion if there were more conservative journalists running America's newsroom s? No conspiracies. No deliberate attempts to slant th e news. It just happens. Because the way reporters and editors see the world , the way their friends and colleagues see the world, matters. In their book The Media Elite, Robert and Susan Lic hter along with Stanley Rothman ask the fundamental question: \"What do jour nalists' backgrounds have to do with their work? In general, the way we were bro ught up and the way we live shape our view of the world.\" It sounds fairly obvious. News, after all, isn't ju st a collection of facts. It's also how reporters and editors see those facts , how they interpret them, and most important, what facts they think are newsw orthy to begin with. So if long ago we came to the conclusion that newsr ooms with too many white men were a bad idea because all we got was the white ma le perspective, then why isn't it just as bad to have so many liberals dom-i nating the culture of the newsroom? Inevitably, they see the world a certain way, from a liberal perspective - a world where money is often seen as a solution to so cial problems, where anti-abortionists are seen as kooks and weirdos, wh ere groups, not just individuals, have rights - and because that's how t hey see things, that's also how they report the news. None of this would matter, of course, if Dan Rather were right when he told Tom Snyder that \"most reporters don't know whether they 're Republican or Democrat, and vote every which way [and]... would fall in the general category of kind of commonsense moderates.\" Because if this business th at nays reporters are a bunch of liberals who almost always vote Democratic is a \"myth,\" as Dan put it, and if this \"myth\" was concocted by a bunch of right-winge rs to make journalists look bad, then this whole issue of liberal bias would ju st be a \"canard,\" to use another of Dan's words. \"This is basically a canard used by politicians, an d I understand why,\" he told a caller on the Snyder show. \"Because they want to blame somebody, anybody but themselves, for people's anger and frustration.\" There's some truth there. Some right-wing ideologue s do blame \"the liberal news media\" for everything from crime to cancer. But tha t doesn't detract from another truth: that, by and large, the media elites really are liberal. And Democrats, too. And both affect their news judgment . None of this should be seen as an argument against liberal values, or as an endorsement of conservative values. This is a big c ountry with a lot of people, and there's room for all sorts of views. This is no thing more than an argument for fairness and balance, something liberals ought to care about as much as conservatives, because if by some unimaginable seri es of events, conservatives wind up in control of not just a cable network here or there, but hundreds of America's newsrooms, then, if history is any guide, they will slant the news to their liking. And the Left in this country will scr eam about how unfair things"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"are - and they will be right. But they ought to rea lize that that's how reasonable, honest con-servatives feel today. On December 6,1998, on a Meet the Press segment abo ut Bill Clinton and his relationship with the Washington news corps, one of the capi-tal's media stars, the Washington Post's Sally Quinn, felt she needed to state what to her was the obvious. The Washington press corps, she insisted, was not s ome \"mono-lith.\" \"We all work for different organizations,\" she said, \"we all thi nk differently.\" Not really, Sally. Two years earlier, in 1996, the Freedom Forum and t he Roper Center released the results of a now famous survey of 139 Washington bu reau chiefs and congressional correspondents. The results make you wonder what in the world Sally Quinn was talking about. The Freedom Forum is an independent foundation that exam-ines issues that involve the media. The Roper Center is an opinion r esearch firm, also with a solid reputation. \"No way that the data are the fru it of right-wing press bashers,\" as the journalist Ben Wattenberg put it. What these two groups found was that Washington jou rnalists are far more liberal and far more Democratic than the typical American v oter: • 89 percent of the journalists said they voted fo r Bill Clinton in 1992, compared with just 43 percent of the nonjournalist voters. • 7 percent of the journalists voted for George Bu sh; 37 percent of the voters did. • 2 percent of the news people voted for Ross Pero t while 19 per-cent of the electorate did. Eighty-nine percent voted for Bill Clinton. This is incredible when you think about it. There's hardly a candidate in the entire United States of America who carries his or her district with 89 percent of the vote. This is way beyond mere landslide numbers. The only politicians who get num bers like that are called Fidel Castro or Saddam Hussein. The same journalist s that Sally Quinn tells us do not constitute a \"monolith\" certainly vote like one. Sally says they \"all think differently.\" About what ? Picking the best appetizer at the Ethiopian restaurant in Georgetown? What party do journalists identify with? • 50 percent said they were Democrats. • 4 percent said they were Republicans. When they were asked, \"How do you characterize your political ori-entation?\" 61 percent said \"liberal\" or \"moderate to liberal.\" On ly 9 percent said they were \"conservative\" or \"moderate to conservative.\" In the world of media elites, Democrats outnumber R epublicans by twelve to one and liberals outnumber conservatives by seven to on e. Yet Dan Rather believes that \"most reporters don't know whether they're Rep ublican or Democrat, and vote every which way.\" In your dreams, Dan. After the survey came out, the Washington Post medi a writer, Howard Kurtz, said on Fox News Sunday, \"Clearly anybody looking at tho se numbers, if they're even close to accurate, would conclude that there is a d iversity problem in the news business, and it's not just the kind of diversity w e usually talk about, which is not getting enough minorities in the news busine ss, but political diversity, as well. Anybody who doesn't see that is just in de nial.\""},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"James Glassman put it this way in the Washington Po st: \"The people who report the stories are liberal Democrats. This is the sham eful open secret of American journalism. That the press itself... chooses to glo ss over it is conclusive evidence of how pernicious the bias is.\" Tom Rosenstiel, the director of the Project for Exc ellence in Jour-nalism, says, \"Bias is the elephant in the living room. We're in denial about it and don't want to admit it's there. We think it's less of a p rob-lem than the public does, and we just don't want to get into it.\" Even Newsweek’s Evan Thomas (the one who thought Ro nald Reagan had \"a kind of intuitive idiot genius\") has said, \"There is a libe ral bias. It's demonstrable. You look at some statistics. About 85 percent of th e reporters who cover the White House vote Demo-cratic; they have for a long time. There is a, particularly at the networks, at the lower levels, among the editors and the so-called infrastructure, there is a liberal bias.\" Nonsense! That's the response from Elaine Povich, who wrote t he Freedom Forum report. No way, she said, that the survey confirms any liberal bias in the media. \"One of the things about being a professional,\" she said, \"is that you attempt to leave your personal feelings aside as you do you r work,\" she told the Washington Times. \"More people who are of a liberal persuasion go int o reporting because they believe in the ethics and the ideals,\" she continue d. \"A lot of conservatives go into the private sector, go into Wall Street, go in to banking. You find people who are idealistic tending toward the report-ing en d.\" \"Right,\" says Ben Wallenberg in his syndicated colu mn. \"These ethical, idealistic journalists left their personal feelings aside to this extent: When queried [in the Freedom Foundation/Roper poll in 19 96] whether the 1994 Contract with America was an 'election-year campaign ploy' r ather than 'a serious reform proposal,' 59 percent said 'ploy' and only 3 percen t said 'serious.'\" It's true that only 139 Washington journalists were polled, but there's no reason to think the results were a fluke. Because t his wasn't the first survey that showed how liberal so many journalists are. A poll back in 1972 showed that of those reporters who voted, 70 percent went for McGovern, the most liberal presidential nominee in recent memory, while 25 percent went for Nixon - the same Rich-ard Nixon wh o carried every single state in the union except Massachusetts. In 1985 the Los Angeles Times conducted a nationwid e survey of about three thousand journalists and the same number of people in the general public to see how each group felt about the major issues of the d ay: • 23 percent of the public said they were liberal; 55 percent of the journalists described themselves as liberal. • 56 percent of the public favored Ronald Reagan; 3 0 percent of the journalists favored Reagan. • 49 percent of the public was for a woman's right to have an abortion; 82 percent of the journalists were pro-choice. • 74 percent of the public was for prayer in publi c schools; 25 percent of the journalists surveyed were for prayer in the pub-lic schools. • 56 percent of the nonjournalists were for affirm ative action; 81 percent of"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"the journalists were for affirmative action. • 75 percent of the public was for the death penalt y in murder cases; 47 percent of the journalists were for the death penalty. • Half the public was for stricter handgun controls ; 78 percent of the journalists were for tougher gun controls. A more recent study, released in March 2000, also c ame to the con-clusion that journalists are different from most of the people t hey cover. Peter Brown, an editor at the Orlando Sentinel in Florida, did a mi ni-census of 3,400 journalists and found that they are less likely to get married and have children, less likely to do volunteer community ser -vice, less likely to own homes, and less likely to go to church than others who live in the communities where they work. \"How many members of the Los Angeles Times and the St. Louis Post-Dispatch\" he asks, \"belong to the American Legion or the Kiwanis or go to prayer breakfasts?\" But it’s not just that so many journalists are so d ifferent from main-stream America. It's that some are downright hostile to wh at many Americans hold sacred. On April 14, 1999,I sat in on a CBS Weekend Mews co nference call from a speakerphone in the Miami bureau. It's usually a ro utine call with CBS News producers all over the country taking part, telling the show producers in New York about the stories coming up in their ter-ritor ies that weekend. Roxanne Russell, a longtime producer out of the Washington bureau, was telling about an event that Gary Bauer would be attending. Bauer was the conservative, family-values activist who seven days later would a nnounce his candidacy for the Republican nomination for president. Bauer was no favorite of the cultural Left, who saw him as an annoy-ing right-wing moralist. Anna Quindlen, the annoying le ft-wing moral-ist and columnist who writes for Newsweek, once called him \"a man best known for trying to build a bridge to the 19th century.\" So maybe I shouldn't have been surprised by what I heard next, but I was. Without a trace of timidity, without any apparent c oncern for potential consequences, Roxanne Russell, sitting at a desk in side the CBS News Washington bureau, nonchalantly referred to this conserva-tive activist as \"Gary Bauer, the little nut from the Christian group.\" The little nut from the Christian group! Those were her exact words, uttered at exactly 12:3 6 P.M. If any of the CBS News producers on the conference call were shocked, not one of them gave a clue. Roxanne Russell had just called Gary Bauer, the hea d of a major group of American Christians, \"the little nut from the Chris tian group\" and merrily went on with the rest of her list of events CBS News in Washington would be covering. What struck me was not the obvious disrespect for B auer. Journalists, being as terribly witty and sophisticated as we are, are alw ays putting someone down. Religious people are especially juicy targets. In a lot of newsrooms, they're seen as odd and viewed with suspicion because their lives are shaped by faith and devotion to God and an adherence to rigid princ iples - opposition to abortion, for one - that seem archaic and closed-mi nded to a lot of journalists who, survey after survey suggests, are not especial ly religious themselves."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"So it wasn't the hostility to Bauer in and of itsel f that threw me. It was the lack of concern of any kind in showing that disresp ect so openly. Producers from CBS News bureaus all over the country were on the p hone. And who knows who else was listening, just as I was. So I wondered: would a network news producer ever m ake such a disparaging remark, so openly, about the head of a Jewish group ? Or a gay group? Or a black group? \"Tomorrow we'll be covering that pro-Israel lobby a nd Sam Schwartz, the, little nut from the Jewish group, will be there.\" Or how about this: \"We'll be covering that gay para de on Saturday and Billy Smith, the little fag from the gay group, will be l eading it.\" Or try this one: \"There's a rally at the Washington Monument this week-end and Jesse Jackson, the big nut from that black group, w ill be there.\" Anything even resembling that kind of talk would be grounds for instant dismissal. But calling a prominent Christian \"the l ittle nut\" is no big deal! Nor was it any big deal, to Ted Turner anyway, when he once said that Christianity was a religion \"for losers,\" a remark he later apolo-gized for. But that didn't stop him on Ash Wednesday 2001 from sha ring more of his wit and wisdom about Christians. Turner was at the CNN bure au in Washington when he noticed that several of his news people had ashes o n their foreheads, and it apparently left him befuddled. \"I was looking at this woman and I was trying to fi gure out what was on her forehead,\" Turner was quoted as saying. \"At first I thought you were in the [Seattle] earthquake, but I realized you're just Je sus freaks.\" Coming from someone else, who knows, it might have been taken as nothing more than to use the catch phrase of the day - an \"inapp ro-priate\" attempt to be funny. But given the religion \"for losers\" comment a decade earlier, some Catholic groups understandably were not laugh-ing. When the news got out, Turner again apologized, calling his remark \"thoughtless.\" But if anyone on the CBS News conference call that day thought the shot at Gary Bauer was thoughtless, you wouldn't know it by the silence. Despite its thirst for diversity, despite years of hiring people to re flect the diversity of America, there apparently wasn't a single pro-ducer at CBS News who heard Roxanne's shot at \"the little nut from the Christia n group\" who would stand up and say \"this is wrong.\" I sure as hell couldn't co mplain. I had made waves three long years ear-lier, and I was still in the d oghouse for it. So what's a news organization to do? CBS can't have producers run-ning around taking nasty little shots at conservatives who head up Christian organizations, can it? And what about that other disturbing little problem, the one about reporters who seem blissfully detached from the ver y people watching and reading their news reports? What to do? How about some good old-fashioned affirmative actio n? Since the Los Angeles Times survey shows that more than eight out of ten journalists favor affirmative action for women and minorities, maybe they could get behind an affirmative action program for anothe r underrepresented minority: conservatives in the world of journalism. Too crazy? Newsroom liberals would never accept it? How do we know? The polls say they love affirmative action. They th ink people who are against it"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"are Neanderthals at best and downright bigots at wo rst. Besides, we're not calling for quotas. That would be wrong. Just some goals and timetables to bring more conservatives into America's newsrooms. An affirmative action plan for conservative journal ists might bring some real diversity to the newsroom, not the make-believe kin d we have now. And while we would tell these conservatives to leave their polit ical and ideological baggage at the door (just as I'm sure liberal journalists h ave been told for years - ya think?}, we should welcome the different perspectiv e they would bring to the job of reporting the news. Of course, in an ideal world, we wouldn't need cons ervatives to bal-ance liberals. In an ideal world, we wouldn't ask, no ma tter how subtly, if a prospective hire was conservative or liberal. In an ideal world, none of this would matter. But obviously we don't live in an ide al world. That's why we have affirmative action. Right? News executives are always saying we need our staff s to look more like the real America. How about if those reporters and editors a nd executives also thought just a little more like the real America? And share d just a little more of their values? And brought just a little more of their per spective to the job? Nahhhh! It's definitely too crazy! The journalists who love affirma-tive action would hate it. Targeting Men Putz. It's one of those funny-sounding, completely ineleg ant Yiddish words that is totally without charm but manages to make its point. Like schmuck. For the uninitiated, putz, loosely translated, mean s jerk - as in \"I went to this fabulously trendy East Side restaurant and ord ered the pesto pasta with sun-dried tomatoes and the waiter brought me spaghe tti and meatballs. What a putz!\" For some reason this word is used a lot in Manhatta n but almost never in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. As for the literal translation of pu tz - don't ask. (Hint: rhymes with Venus.) Putz probably had its heyday during the 1998 New Yo rk Senate race, when Republican Al D'Amato called his Democratic opponen t, Charles Schumer, a \"putzhead,\" a witty variation on the original \"putz \" - perhaps not in the Oscar Wilde or George Bernard Shaw class of sophisticated observations, but no one ever confused Al D'Amato with Oscar Wilde or George Bernard Shaw. Such uncivil behavior caught the ever watchful eye of the New York Times editorial page, which said such language epitomized D'Amato's nastiness and vitriol. The Times also noted that New Yorkers who in the past might have voted for D'Amato rejected him in 1998, at least in part because of the \"wounding power of slurs.\" The \"wounding power of slurs\" is something the New York Times and sensitive network news types are always on the lookout for. E xcept when the slur is aimed at the one group they consider fair game. Men. This brings us to Harry Smith, the former coanchor of CBS This Morning, as"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"affable a feminist as you'll ever meet - and even i n a busi-ness populated by so many liberals, Harry is out there, way off in left field. It was the summer of 1995, August 14, to be exact. I had just come back from a vacation in Alaska with my wife, Nancy, and our daughter, Catherine. W e were at a hotel in Seattle, and I turned on CBS This Morning to see what was go ing on. There was Harry interviewing the actor Dennis Quaid about a movie he had just done, Something to Talk About. In the movie Quaid p lays a sleazeball, a married man who can't keep his hands off half the women in town. To Harry this is how men act in real life too. Whic h prompted him to say to Quaid, \"I'm under the assumption that most men are putzes.\" In Harry's mind this was a perfectly reasonable obs ervation. Because to Harry Smith, most men are putzes. I know this because I c alled him a few days later and asked just what he had in mind. \"Men are the cheaters,\" Harry told me. \"Men are the philanderers. We're the ones who don't take care of our families.\" The word putz was creeping into my mind... but it w asn't most men''' I was thinking about. \"And white guys are running around the country comp laining that they're victims,\" he added, just to make sure I was getting his point. I understand all that hut what I can't figure out i s how you can spell \"Harry Smith\" without using the letters pc. But what if affable Harry Smith (who in 1999 left C BS News to host A&E's Biography) in some other context had said, \"I'm und er the assumption that most black people are putzes”? Or \"most Irish are putzes \"? Or \"most Jews are putzes\"? Let's put it this way: if he had said any of those things, good ol' Harry would have been out on his affable liberal ass in about t he time it would have taken his bosses to say, \"Pack your stuff and get out, yo u putz\\\" Even then, Harry would have been lucky to get a job doing the overni ght news at a radio station in Kodiak, Alaska, which is one of those places whe re they don't use the word putz all that much. \"What if you said on the air,\" I asked Harry, \"you know, I think most women are putzes. Do you think management would have tolerate d that?\" He couldn't stop laughing. What Harry meant is, ''' 'You've got to be kidding, putzhead - they would have tossed me out the freaki n' window\" Nobody at CBS News thought this putz episode was an y big deal. Eric Ober, the president of the news division, said it was a joke. No harm, no foul. I'm sure he was right. And I'm sure he would have f elt the same way if I had gone on television and said, \"You know, Ms. Steinem , I don't understand what you and all your feminist friends are always com-plaini ng about. You women are such putzes\" And it was a joke, too, when Katie Couric, on NBC, asked a bride who had been jilted at the altar about a proper remedy: \"Have yo u con-sidered castration as an option?\" Warren Farrell, a California psychologist and forme r board member of the New York chapter of NOW, was exercising at his home nea r San Diego, watching the Today show, the morning Katie made her castration j oke. In his book, Women Can't Hear What Mm Don't Say, he won-dered what would hap pen if Katie's cohost, Matt Lauer, asked a jilted groom, \"Have you considered t he option of cutting off her"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"breasts?\" Well, Farrell didn't really wonder what would happe n. Like every-body else, he knew. \"NBC would be considering the option of cutti ng off his contract.\" The difference between the two is obvious, isn't it ? Castration is funny. Cutting off breasts is not funny. But Warren Farrell was on to something. An executiv e at CBS News - who doesn't want his name attached to such an un-PC idea - cal ls it the \"License to Overkill.\" \"Any group that feels, rightly or wrongly, that it has been oppressed, no matter how much or how little, has the license to overkill ,\" he told me. \"It's sort of like James Bond's 007 license. But that's just a li cense to kill. \"Once you have the license to overkill you can say just about any-thing you want about the oppressors. And get away with it.\" The New York Times - the paper that worries about t he \"wounding power of slurs\" - apparently possesses this 007-plus license. Take a story by Times reporter Natalie Angier that begins this way: \"Women may not find this surprising, but one of the most persi stent and frustrating problems in evolutionary biology is the male. Speci fically... why doesn't he just go away?\" Or how about this story by the same Ms. Angier: \"To day is Father's Day.... We women are supposed to... make them feel like prince s while letting them act like turnips. \"The section you are reading is about women's healt h. And so what better place to address the question: Are they worth it?... Do w e live better with men or without them?\" Men should not lose their sense of humor as some fe minists have. This is what passes for clever at the Times. But what if she had written that blacks commit a disproportionate amount of violent street crime, ma ke up a disproportionate' number of inmates in our prisons, and because of th at, drain tux dollars that might otherwise go to libraries and museums and hom eless shelters? \"Are they worth it? Do we live better with blacks o r without them?\" The reason one question is supposed to be legitimat e and the other isn't is that blacks (or gays or women) haven't lived the life of privilege and power that (white) men supposedly have. The License to Overkil l lets Ms. Angier and the Times ask dopey questions about whether men \"are wo rth it\" but would never allow someone to ask another bigoted question about wheth er blacks are worth it. Sometimes it's important to state the obvious: Not all men - not even all white men - have power and privilege. Some work in corner offices on the fiftieth floor, and some work in coal mines and fast food re staurants. But it's that kind of shallow, stereotypical thinking that leads to sh oddy journalism when it comes to serious gender issues that affect men. Even Sam Donaldson, one of the toughest reporters i n all of tele-vision journalism, turns into a sniveling wimp when it com es to chal-lenging feminists. A while back, Donaldson wrote in his autobiography, Hold On, Mr. President!, \"because of me no one gets a free ride.\" Well, almo st no one. Once Sam called a female park ranger a \"rangerette\" and got so many c omplaints from angry feminists that years later, he tells us, he \"failed to ask a single challenging, provocative question of leaders of feminist organiz ations\" regarding a"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"controversial rape story. \"I've been very careful a bout offending women,\" he writes. \"I'll challenge presidents any day, but tak ing on half the world is asking too much.\" Nice going, putz! Asa Baber, who writes the \"Men\" column for Playboy picked up on Sam's wimpiness. \"I am here to invite you, whenever you get the ball s, to join me in challenging the excesses of feminism, Sam.\" The problem, Baber pointed out, is that if you feel intimidated by feminists, if you really believ e they in fact have a license to overkill, then you're going to take a dive on a whole range of serious issues that affect men - and their wives and children. \"Who among the... presidential candidates of the pa st two decades,\" Baber asks, \"has spoken boldly about men's rights? Who has even used the phrase? Who has represented us on the presidential stump in the are as of divorce, child custody, abortion, military-draft registration, false accusa tions of rape, high unemployment for both young and old men, male longe vity and health, discrimination against men in the workplace and in the culture?\" If the big-time media elites weren't such feminists themselves, or afraid of offending them, they might have done some fresh, in teresting stories on a whole range of gender issues instead of the old \"safe\" cl ichés. We've done a million stories at the networks on dea dbeat dads - fair enough - but almost none on how too many divorced women use cus-tody and visitation as weapons to punish their ex-husbands for what went w rong during the marriage. It's true enough that some men really are deadbeats . But the deadbeat dad stories we often do are about those rich doctors an d businessmen who would rather spend their money on convertibles and speedb oats and young blondes than on their own children. That happens, but it's not t ypical. The real story is that a lot of men who don't pay support are poor; t hey hold menial jobs; they're undereducated. Many of them pay when they can. Journalists, and liberals in general, should care a bout poor men like that. But to the media elites - being as reliably feminist as they are - the very idea that men in divorce and custody cases might be part of an oppressed class is an alien concept. So only occasionally do we tiptoe ne ar a story about the millions of divorced dads who want to maintain a strong rela tionship with their kids but are kept away by angry moms. As long as the media elites let feminists from the Left define the issue, they will always see men as the bad guys, as the putzes of America. And that's why we: won't see stories that ask why, after more than thirty years of modern feminism, we still have laws saying that only eighteen-year-old men have to sign up with Selective Service, in case the government reinstates the military draft. Young women do not. We get entire segments on the news about breast can cer - but hardly a word about prostate cancer. We see tons of stories about how women don't earn a s much as men in the workplace - but we see virtually nothing on the eve ning news about why there's a difference. In Women Can't Hear What Men Don't Say, Warren Farreh1 tells us. Men do indeed earn more, he says, \"but for very dif ferent work (more hazardous jobs, more technical professions like engineering o r brain surgeon, etc.), very different behavior at work (longer hours, working n ight shifts, etc.), and very"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"different efforts to obtain the work (working in mu ch less enticing locations [Alaskan oil rigs, coal mines], commut-ing further, relocating more, working overseas), and so on.\" And why haven't reporters asked the commonsense que stion that Farrell asked me when we spoke: \"If women really earned 59 cents [or whatever it supposedly is up to now] to the dollar for the same work as men, how could a business compete with its competition by hiring men at any level?'' In other words, wouldn't all businesses hire only women if everything else was t he same, and they really did work for less money? By constantly portraying women as second-class citi zens, as helpless victims of the all-powerful, oppressive, white-male power stru cture, a certain image of men is created. And it's not particularly sympathetic. But if all this had no effect in the real world, if it simply were a mat-ter of CBS News being tone deaf when Harry Smith says most men are putzes and NBC not caring when Katie Couric jokes about castration, it would only be annoying. But images really do count, even in such seemingly small, unimportant matters. The way we portrayed women in the media - cleaning toilet bowls in those old black-and-white TV commercials, grinning like child ren when their much smarter husbands let them drive the new '55 Olds - shaped n ot only the way we saw women, but the way we treated them, even if way back then almost no one found anything par-ticularly offensive about the images. It's the same with men today. In 1998 I covered a story that would have sent shiv ers down Kafka's spine, a story about a feminist politician, whose bureaucrac y was run-ning amok and ruining innocent lives. It was happening in Los Angeles, where men - no one knew for sure how many - were being forced to pay child support, for up to e ighteen years, for children that everyone agreed were not theirs! Gil Garcetti, then the district attorney of Los Ang eles County, a politician with strong ties to southern California feminists, was on a very public crusade to make deadbeat dads pay up. Except that the burea ucracy went haywire and completely innocent men were caught in Gil Garcetti 's dragnet. One of them was a young man named John Johnson, who received in the mail a court order to pay $7,000 in delinquent support for a chi ld he had no relationship to whatsoever. The official papers had Johnson's name and address right, but everything else on the paper was wrong. The John Jo hnson that Garcetti was looking for had a different social security number and a different driver's license number. This man I was talking to clearly w as not a deadbeat dad. The bureaucrats had the wrong John Johnson. The bureaucrats' reaction: tough luck. \"I've been making phone calls,\" John Johnson told m e, \"I've been complaining. I've been sending letters. They don't respond. My q ues-tion is: What do they do to protect against picking the wrong people with co mmon names like mine? What do they do? Can they just go after anybody and nobody' s accountable? There's something wrong. There's something wrong with that department.\" Then there was Walter Vollmer, a German immigrant w ho settled in southern California with his wife Christina thirty years ago . One day, Vollmer went to his mailbox and found a bill for back child support ... $206,000 of back child support!"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"\"Apparently there is some other Walter Vollmer arou nd,\" his lawyer, Craig Elkin, told me. \"And my only guess at this point is that t hey found a Walter Vollmer in Los Angeles County, and they figured, 'How many can there be? Let's send the bill to him.'\" For months Vollmer couldn't fix the problem. He cou ldn't convince any of the bureaucrats they had the wrong man. His wife, a pro per woman with old-world sensibilities, was starting to wonder if he had bee n leading a secret life. \"I was frightened,\" she told me. Could the governme nt really be so wrong? she kept wondering. How could it continue to send her h usband bills month after month unless he really did have a mysterious child somewhere? Maybe, she admits thinking, he had a second wife hidden away someplac e. The pressure was so great they almost divorced after thirty-one years of marr iage. Finally, his lawyer convinced Gil Garcetti that he had made a mis-take. But other men weren't nearly so lucky. Tony Jackson, a working-class black man with a wife and two kids, got a bill from Gil Garcetti's deadbeat dad squad saying he ow ed $13,000 in back child support for a child that, he would soon prove, was not his. Jackson took a DNA test at a lab the court picked. It showed he was definitely not the father. Tough luck. The law says anyone who receives an official court notice saying he owes child support has thirty days to respond - thirty days! - and if you don't respond in thirty days, you're considered \"in default\" and mus t pay support - until the child is eighteen. Jackson was named by a woman he used to date, who, in order to qualify for welfare, had to name somebody as the father of her child. So she picked Tony Jackson, even though he wasn't the father. Jackson didn't respond to the court order within thirty days, because he swears he neve r got the notice. He says he learned about it after it was sent to a former empl oyer who never forwarded it to him. Still, he was ordered to pay child support for a child everyone, even Gil Garcettti, agreed was not his. When I met Tony Jackson, he was a wreck. On the ver ge of suicide, I feared. He cried during our conversation. He said he couldn't take his own two kids out to a restaurant for a meal. He couldn't afford it, bec ause the court was taking the child support out of his paycheck before he ever go t it. Jackson finally got a lawyer, Louis Dell, who told me, \"The district attorney has a win-at-all-costs attitude. It's unconscionabl e. We have the benefit of very accurate genetic blood testing. It tells us wh at the truth is. It tells us that Mr. Jackson is not the father.\" It didn't matt er. Jackson didn't respond in time, which put him \"in d efault.\" So he had to pay child support for someone else's child. He took a s econd job as a night security guard to make ends meet. This left him less time to spend with his own children. \"It's a dark alley,\" Tony Jackson told me while try ing, without much success, to hold back his tears. \"There's no light at the end o f the tunnel.\" When I told Gil Garcetti about this, at his offices in downtown Los Angeles, he was straightforward and unsympathetic. \"It's very simple. If you don't respond to the cour t's summons and no one ever shows up in court for you, we will get a default ju dgment against you. It's that"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"simple. I am out there to try and collect as much m oney as I ran for the children, for the custodial mother who is on welfar e or who barely has enough money to stay off welfare. I'm going to do that.\" But why not just say, \"Look, you're clearly not the father, the pater-nity test has proved it. All right, you don't have to pay\"? I asked him. \"That violates the law,\" was his cold-blooded answe r. Had he ever gone after a mother who falsely named a n old boyfriend just to qualify for welfare? Had he ever filed charges agai nst even one? No, he said. Not even one. It would be too difficult to prove sh e was lying, he said. Maybe she had just made an honest mistake. I also met an undercover Los Angeles police detecti ve who was named the father of an ex-girlfriend's baby and was ordered to pay $ 14,000 in back support, which the bureaucrats were garnisheeing from his wages, a chunk each week. \"They claim that they served me with a subpoena tha t I didn't respond to in court,\" he told me. \"And they entered a judgment in default. They said that I was legally the father.\" But he also took a DNA test that proved without any doubt he was not the father. His lawyer, a young woman named Fatima Araiza, was fuming when I spoke to her. \"They've got that judgment against you and it's goi ng to be enforced regardless of all the screaming, the jumping up and down that you do saying, 'Look, I'm not the dad, I'm not the dad, everybody knows I'm not t he dad. It's been acknowledged. It's been proven.' And what they're s aying is, 'So what?' \"This is no longer the oppression of women,\" she sa id, \"this is now the oppression of men. The oppression of responsible me n.\" What did Garcetti have to say? \"The law is the law.\" This was an injustice that could only happen in a c ulture where men are seen as putzes with too much power, especially over women. But as troubling as the story was, what I found eve n more disturbing was that even though about ten million Americans watched it on the now defunct CBS News program Public Eye, only two called - two men who t hought what they had seen was insane. Had I done a story about a dog that was mistreated, it would have evoked more sympathy - a lot more! - than these men were receiv ing. There were no calls from the civil rights establish ment, even though many of the victims were poor black and Hispanic men. No calls from the ACLU. No calls from feminists, either, who would rightly have inarched on City Hall if the tables had been turned. Just imagine: a network news story saying there are hundreds of women in Los Angeles County being forced to pay child support fo r children that are not theirs. Some women were just unlucky enough to have common names like Mary Jones. But others were picked by old boyfriends who had to name someone in order to qualify for welfare. The women took DNA tests or dered by the courts. They proved con-clusively they were not the mothers. The district attorney, a man known to embrace men's causes, said, too bad. \"The law's the law; they didn't respond to the court order within thirty days.\" Can you imagine that? Neither can I. But this is what happens when simplistic deadbeat d ad stories become a staple of"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"American journalism. It creates an atmosphere in wh ich it's easier to accept the notion that once a man has been called a deadbeat, he must be. No matter what the DNA says. Call men putzes on a network news program, and you start to think it's okay to bash them, either with words or with Garcetti-type actions. Let cute, perky Katie ask a jilted bride if she con sidered castrating the bum, and the images start to do their work. The message becomes clear: Men are the problem. Isn't that what Natalie Angier of the New York Times was writing about when she asked, \"Are they worth it? Do we live bett er with men or without them?\" Add to that odds and ends like a piece from Anna Qu indlen who wrote in her old New York Times column, \"Some of my best friends are men. It is simply that I think women are superior to men.\" Or a Times headli ne in the book review section that simply states, \"Don't Expect Too Much of Men.\" Or an uncritical CNN story about a book called How to Make Your Man Behave in 21 Days or Less Using the Secrets of Professional Dog Trainers. I know it might seem trivial. I understand the Lice nse to Overkill. How it's okay to say anything about the rich and powerful. E xcept that most men are not rich and powerful. Most men are not CEOs. Certainly not those men in Los Angeles - Tony Jackson, John Johnson, Walter Vollmer, and t he undercover LAPD detective. They know, just as the early feminists knew, that t he way journalists portray any group of people matters. But if it were just ha ppening in the often silly, superficial world of the media, especially televisi on news, it wouldn't mean all that much. What makes it matter is that male bashin g on TV takes a hard toll in the real world. Any putz ought to understand that. During the Yankees-Mets World Series in 2000, Mered ith Vieira of The View, the ABC gabfest for women, went to Shea Stadium to make a jackass out of herself. She went up to Mets slugger Mike Piazza and said, \" Let's talk about bats. Who has the biggest wood on the team?\" According to Sal ly Jenkins of the Washington Post, who was there, Piazza rolled his eyes. Vieira also asked one of the other players, \"Who's your favorite player to pat on the behind?\" When confronted, Vieira reportedly said, \"I'm just having fun,\" and to Jenkins she claimed, \"It was shtick.\" \"Okay then,\" Jenkins writes, \"for the sake of comed y, for shtick, imagine that Piazza asked Vieira such a question. 'Hey Meredith, who's got the biggest ta-tas?' We would label him a leering pre-Cambrian swine, and throw him to a snarling pack of post-feminists, who would rip his mustache off by the bristles, right? So what do we do with Vieira?\" Good question, Sally. Unfortunately, the answer is nothing. Absolutely nothing. Because, except for you, and maybe one or two other s, nobody in the mainstream media is going to criticize a feminist. It's agains t the rules. It's bad form. No one said a word to Harry Smith when he called mo st men putzes, right? But don't jump to any conclusions about how this pr oves some kind of hypocritical left-wing media bias. It only looks th at way, putz. \"Where Thieves and Pimps Run Free\""},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"Hunter Thompson, the journalist and author who once ran for sheriff of Aspen on the Freak Power ticket, who only did drugs if they began with a letter of the alpha-bet, and who consequently was thought (mistak enly) to be a few fries short of a Happy Meal, was never more scathingly per-cept ive than when he put TV in his crosshairs. \"The TV business is a cruel and shallow money trenc h, a long plastic hallway where thieves and pimps run free and good men die l ike dogs.\" Whatever we may think of television in America, thi s much is cer-tain: it's not good when someone who has abused his mind and body as much as Hunter Thompson has comes up with something this hon-est and brilli ant about the medium. It sets a bad example for the kids of America. How can grow nups tell them drugs are bad when they see what they've done for Thompson, a man who glided through the 1960s thinking acid was a health food? However many brain cells Thompson might have lost o ver the years, in the Hummer of 1999 his classic description of the TV business was proven true - again. That's when America's oldest arid most respected ci vil rights organization, the NAACP, took a long, hard look down that plastic hal lway and didn't like what it saw. All it could see at CBS, NBC, ABC, and Fox was a ca dre of like-minded Moguls - the Titans of Television - the people who shape our pop culture by deciding what gets on the prime-time TV schedule and what doesn't . As far as the NAACP was concerned, these white liberals were behaving like a gang of rednecks decked out in Armanis who might as well have been fronting for David Duke. NAACP president Kweisi Mfume said the TV business w as \"the most segregated industry in the United States.\" Other civil rights lead-ers accused the Moguls of whitewashing, even ethnic purification. This is the kind of language usually reserved for the Klan and leaders of the Third Reic h. Not the Beverly Hills crowd. What set off the NAACP was the networks' new fall s chedules, of all things, which in the view of Kweisi Mfume didn't feature en ough black characters (or Hispanic or Asian or other minority characters) in big roles on the networks' sitcoms and dramas. You can make a case, of course, that instead of com plaining the NAACP should have been celebrating. This is how Michael Medved, the mildly conservative social critic with uncommon sense, put it in USA To day: Imagine for a moment that all of the nation's broadcast exec-utives took boycott and legal threats of NAACP president Kweisi Mfume instantly to heart. Th ey immediately agree to , multiply many times over the number of people of co lor depicted on prime-time TV series. Suddenly, the percentage of black protagoni sts soars to more than 20 percent - well beyond the 13 percent of the populat ion identified as African-American. But as part of this happy fantasy, also assume that every-thing else about network television's offerings remains exactly the same - the same crudeness, rudeness, mindlessness, snig-gering sex references, immaturity, exploitation and emphasis on instant gratification. Would merely adj usting the skin color of some prominent characters significantly alter the nature of television itself - and automatically improve its impact on black people? The Moguls weren't interested in questions like tha t. What they were interested in was heading off trouble. Boycotts and pickets ar e bad for business. So even"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"though they tend to dismiss criticism from the Righ t about how television's \"crudeness, rudeness, mindlessness, [and] snig-geri ng sex references\" affect the culture, that summer they were far more sympathetic - and far more fearful! - of their friends on the Left. So they gave their solem n word as television Moguls to do better. \"This is something we're paying attention to,\" Fox Entertainment president Doug Herzog somberly announced. \"We realize there's still work to be done,\" was NBC 's earnest reply. \"In May we acknowledged that our new fall programmi ng wasn't as ethnically diverse as we would have liked,\" was ABC's apologia . CBS, along with all the other major networks, under standably con-cerned that their TV studios would be surrounded by pickets cha nting, \"No Justice, No Peace,\" promised to add more minority characters to its programs as soon as possible. What the Moguls did not say, amidst all the promise s to do better, was that they're in business to make money, that everything they do in their plastic hallways is about making money, that Hunter Thompso n, that troublemaking, acid-popping weirdo had picked just the right words to describe what they already knew: that the TV business really is \"a cru el and shallow money trench.\" Didn't those NAACP-types understand - -the Moguls don't keep blacks off of their sitcoms because they don't like black people? They keep them off the air because they make more money with white people. In the immortal words of James \"Cueball\" Carville: \"It's the econ-omy, stupid!\" Advertisers like white audiences. They have more mo ney to spend. Robert Johnson, a black Mogul who heads the Black Entertainment Net work, said what the white Moguls wouldn't. \"If I'm a network executive, who's probably white . . . and I'm going to launch a show that I think advertisers will like because i t will deliver a white audience that the advertisers value more, I'm not g oing to go and try to do something risky and creative with black people and white people,\" he said. \"I'm certainly going to stay away from black-and-white s ex, so that takes out any romance stories involved with black men and white w omen. I'll probably take out any show that shows a black man as a dynamic busine ssman, sort of lording over white people, because that's going to offend the an gry white male.\" TV executives populate their little make-believe wo rld with white stars because they believe that white adults, by and large, would rather watch white stars, by and large - Cosby and Winfrey being more the exce ptions that prove the rule. And there's plenty of evidence to support that beli ef. I looked at the ratings from Nielsen Media Research for the second quarter of 1999 (March 29-June 27) - just before the NAACP leveled its charges against t he networks - and found that almost none of the top shows among black viewe rs were watched by white viewers - and vice versa: • The top program that black viewers watched was Th e Steve Harvey Show on WB.

And while blacks were watching shows starring black people, whites were watching shows starring white people: • The number one show in America among white viewer s during the second quarter of 1999 was Frasier, the NBC show about two annoyin gly effete brothers, both psychiatrists, who know more about Italian art of t he Renaissance than they do about the World Series. Among blacks, Frasier finis hed 105th. What a surprise! • ER was the second biggest show with white viewer s.

When it comes to the world of television, especiall y sitcom tele-vision, there really are two Americas - one white, the other blac k. Except on Monday nights in the fall.

Survivor finished first among white viewers and seventeenth among blacks. Millionaire was third wit h whites, fourteenth with blacks. So, is there a lesson here that goes beyond a color -blind fascination with athletes and angel and so-called \"reality\" arid mil lion-dollar game shows? Will blacks and whites - in large numbers - watch a show that features both blacks and whites? If TV shows were less segregated, would more people watch? Maybe. In 2001, Law & Order, The Practice, and ER - all smart, well-written dramas with racially mixed casts - finished in the top twenty with both black and white audiences. But what if Frasier and Steve Harvey did a show tog ether? What if half the friends on Friends were black? Would the audience b e much bigger or much smaller? In other words, would more blacks watch Fr asier and Friends - or would fewer whites watch? Or, to put it another way, how much integration is too much integration in the make-believe world of television ? I don't know. But I'm pretty sure about this: We're not about to find out anytime soon. The Moguls won't tamper with success. Friends and Frasier are gold mines. Bring a few blacks into those neighborhoods, and you run the risk of massive white flight. And that would mean lower rat ings, which would mean less ad revenue, which would mean - and this is the real ly important part - the Moguls could become ex-Moguls over-night. And that - not looking out for Number One - is the only real sin in the plastic hallways where the Moguls conduct the business of television. So, while the Moguls on the Left Coast support virt ually every item on the liberal agenda, while they embrace diversity and af firmative action and deplore segregation in the real world, in the summer of 199 9 they stood accused of practicing racial separation in the TV world they c ontrolled. That may make them hypocrites, but does it really make them racists an d ethnic purifiers, the way the NAACP meant it?"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"I don't think so. If the networks' research departments did studies d iscovering that ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox could make more money with black shows than with white shows, the whole fall lineup would look like Harlem. All the f riends on Friends would be black. Everyone on Cheers would have been black. If someone discovered that Eskimo shows got bigger ratings and more advertising revenue, the geniuses at the networks would change Frasier's name to Nanook. ER would be set in Alaska. They're not bigots, these Titans who control so muc h of our pop cul-ture. They give money to charity and they love their families. They're just businessmen doing what businessmen do. It's in their nature to make the bottom line the top priority. The color they care most about is green. What could be more American than that? Unfair? How else should we explain CBS's shameless decision to put Howard Stern on its owned and operated TV stations on Saturday night? C BS airs Howard Stern because the TV show costs next to nothing to produce and br ings in lots of money. So what if the show is filled with farting contests an d women shaving their pubic hair? If the Tiffany Network would sink that low fo r money, it shouldn't surprise anyone that it would toss a few black folk s over the side for a single rating point. This is no bulletin, of course, to anybody who know s how the TV business works. The cultural liberals believe in civil rights as al l decent Americans do. They just believe in their own success more. They like l iving in Beverly Hills and driving new Jaguars and Mercedes. Who wouldn't? And they're not going to give it all up by putting any more blacks (or other minorit ies) on TV than they absolutely have to. For what it's worth, a black actor in Los Angeles, Damon Standifer, had a completely different theory on why there are so few blacks on TV. In the Los Angeles Times on June 28, 1999, he wrote: \"Every ty pe of 'black' show has been protested [by black activists]: If a show portrays wealthy black people, it's criticized for ignoring the plight of poor ones. If a show features poor black people... it's criticized for stereotyping black people as poor....In past years there were co mplaints that the TV show Seinfeld never featured a black lead. But h onestly, which Seinfeld lead could have been cast as an African-American without drawing protests from [black critics]: The spastic, bug-eyed Kramer? The chronic ally unemployed, lazy George? The sexually promiscuous, self-centered Elaine? Had these characters been black, Seinfeld wouldn't have lasted one season.\" The Moguls didn't have anything to say about that. But within months, network executives were falling all over themselves adding minority char-acters to their prime-time lineups. And NBC even promised to add at least one minority writer to any show that survived its first season. You've got to hand it to the NAACP. It had actually portrayed Hollywood, one of the most liberal communities in the solar system, a s racist. Kweisi Mfume and his organization had some of the toughest guys in t own apologizing all over the place. As my old friend John Leo, of U.S. News & Wo rld Report, put it, \"If these people [network executives] are hard-core racists, systematically excluding blacks and other minorities in the entertainment bu siness, we have some"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"stop-the-press news.\" But while the NAACP was busy accusing the Moguls of segregation, there was another kind of ethnic purification going on in the plastic hallways of the television business. This time, it had nothing to d o with make-believe shows in Hollywood. This time, the whitewashing was going on in the sacred halls of the network news divisions in New York. The dirty little secret is this: the top producers and executives who decide what stories get on the air don't want blacks on th eir prime-time news magazines any more than the Moguls in Hollywood want them in their prime-time sitcoms. And the news elites despite their devotion to equal ity and all that - don't want Hispanics on their magazine shows, either. Or poor people' - no matter what color they are. I'm not talking about the race or ethnicity of repo rters. At all the networks, there's a real commitment to get black and other mi nority journalists on the air. This is about the real-life characters whose s tories are told on shows like 48 Hours and Dateline and 20/20, the programs that, because they're much cheaper to produce than Hollywood dramas, can make the netw orks a lot of money if they get big enough ratings. The line I heard over and over again at CBS News an d from several sources at NBC was, \"They're not our audience. They don't watch us .\" There was a feeling that if the characters were black or Hispanic or lower c lass, \"our [CBS News] audience\" wouldn't be able to identify with them or care about their problems, because CBS news viewers are mostly older white peo ple who live away from the big cities. Just like the Moguls on the West Coast, when money is on the line, when their jobs and their hefty salaries are at stake, the lib eral news media do what money demands. The problem is that, over the years, news has morph ed into entertain-ment. To the network brass, Dateline is the same as ER or Fr iends. They all have to compete for prime-time audiences. At CBS, 48 Hours is the same as Everybody Loves Raymond. At ABC, 20/20 is on the exact same p rime-time schedule as The Practice and Who Wants to Be a Millionaire. They're all shows! They all have to get good ratings to survive. News isn't special, th e way it was in the early days of television. News maga-zines aren't on the a ir to perform some public service. Maybe they were when 60 Minutes got starte d, but not anymore. Prime-time news maga-zines are on TV to make money, just like everything else on television. So they have to play by entertainment's rules. They have to be watched by people who have money to spend on products that are advertised on those shows. So they do what the Holl ywood Moguls do. They make sure their characters appeal to their audience, whi ch in the world ol big network television means the more middle-class whit e people the better. If black people were big consumers of news magazine shows, then the network producers would have some incentive to find stories about black people. But are they? Do blacks watch news magazines in big enough numbers for the mostly white producers in New York, who always have ratings on t heir minds, to put black people on the air? The answer is - not really. According to Nielsen, during that same second quart er of 1999, six of the top twenty-five shows among white viewers were news mag a-zines. But none of those"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"shows finished in the top twenty-five with black vi ewers.  Program Name White Rank Black Rank 60 Minutes 7 26 Dateline Monday 12 81 20/20 Wednesday 14 35 Dateline Friday 14 (tie) 85 Dateline Tuesday 14 (tie) 55 20/20 Friday 21 38 So just as the West Coast big shots don't want too many blacks as main characters on Frasier or Friends, the news Moguls d on't want too many black characters in stories on 48 Hours or Dateline or 20 /20 - and for the exact same reason: white audiences want to see characters who look like they do. People they can identify with. Joyce Maynard, the novelist , calls it \"the virtually endless fascination most of us feel for watching ou rselves and our neighbors on television.\" Or as a producer at 48 Hours puts it, \"All we do ar ound here is mur-der, murder, murder, murder, sex. And only about white people.\" That producers talk this way is only a secret to ou tsiders, to the civil-ians in the audience. At the networks, inside the news maga zines, it's no secret at all. I spoke to many producers who, with only slight var iations, told the same story: White characters appeal to more viewers than black characters. More viewers mean higher ratings. So we pick white char-acters whenev er we can! Av Westin, a producer who worked with Ed Murrow at CBS and ran 20/20 in the 1980s for ABC, did a survey (in 2000) of network jo ur-nalists for the Freedom Forum and came to the same conclusion. One source t old him, \"We do not feature black people. I mean, it's said. Actually, they whi sper it, 'Is she white?'\" Over the years, I picked up tidbits just like that from producers I worked with, stories that were told over dinner or in the car on the way to a story. I won't share their names in order to protect the innocent. Bad things happen to news people who tell stories about their own newsrooms, especially when the stories are embarrassingly true. In 1999,I was shooting a story for 48 Hours about k ids who were in jail for serious, violent crimes, including murder. The main character in the piece was a teenage black girl. The senior staff in New York di dn't know she was black but were suspicious. So one New York producer asked the field producer, \"What is she?\" meaning what color or ethnic group is she. \"She's black,\" the producer told his boss in New Yo rk, \"but she's light-skinned? He felt he had to say that to get the okay to proce ed with the story. If she were just plain old black, the New York brass might have balked and told him to find another character, meaning another character w ho wasn't black. He was embarrassed about the incident because he knew how it sounded. Another 48 Hours producer told me about a Hispanic man with a slight accent who was edited out of his story before it aired. Was th e man understandable? I asked"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"him. \"Absolutely. Totally.\" Then why did they edit him out? \"lice ;HIHC (hey don't think our audience cares about Hispanics.\" This concern for race and ethnicity is common knowl edge at 48 Hours. One producer told me he would be asked, '\"What racial b ack-ground are these people?' They were not subtle at all. They made it pretty da mn clear to me that 'we want stories with white folks.'\" \"It was tough to take,\" he went on, and it was the \"most explosive piece of inside information I was privy to.\" What information exactly was that? I asked him. \"That it was racist.\" Another producer, who has worked at several network s, told me that when he worked in the CBS News Dallas bureau, there was \"a general understanding\" that the Evening News didn't want stories about Mexicans or Indians. \"Why not?\" I asked him. The answer: \"They think nobody cares abo ut them.\" An NBC News correspondent told me that \"a white rag s to riches story will make it [on a magazine program] far more quickly than a black rags to riches story.\" Why? \"Let's not kid ourselves,\" he said, \"these sho ws make a tremendous amount of money. There's no profit in people of color.\" These paragons of liberalism who run the magazine s hows aren't just afraid of turning off their mostly white audiences by putting minorities on the air, they're also worried about scaring their viewers wi th ugly people! I have a memo entitled \"48 Hours Survival Guide.\" I t's an unsigned but serious three-page paper handed out to the producers on the staff, outlining what makes a good 48 Hours story. In it, I found this gem: \"Looks count, too. This is television after all. Yo u can find the most articulate character in the world but if she has no teeth or has a beard, no one will hear what she is saying. Therefore you must AL WAYS meet your character in person BEFORE any shoot.\" Since there aren't that many toothless or bearded w < >men out there, what the memo is really saying is: No Fat Chicks with Big No ses on 48 Hours - presumably, even if one is a doctor who just found a cure for cancer. We wouldn't want to frighten our viewers, now, woul d we? In the spring of 2000, I launched an experiment. Du ring the May \"sweeps,\" one of the key months when ratings are used to determine h ow much the networks can charge for future commercials, I monitored all the editions of 20/20 (10 shows, 26 stories), 48 Hours (6 shows, 12 stories), 60 Min utes (4 shows, 12 stories), and Dateline (15 shows, 39 stories) - 35 programs in all, 89 stories - to see if, and to what extent, the news media elites were whitewashing their magazine shows. There were hundreds of characters in the stories, b ut I was only inter-ested in the main characters, the ones the stories were abou t. Here's what I found: Dateline ran stories about every titillating subjec t under the sun, which is what TV magazines routinely do during sweeps. They did pieces on prostitutes in Eastern Europe... about Rave parties where kids dan ce and take drugs... they ran \"A family reunion you'll never forget\"... they had a story about lie detectors... about kicking the smoking habit... abo ut testosterone... about killer tornadoes... about people who survived car w recks and fires... there was a story about air-conditioning units called \"Silent Killer\"... there was a piece about a nasty dog breeder... and, of course, there was the mandatory \"murder"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"mystery\" involving the death of a little girl. So how many blacks were featured as main characters in those fifteen Dateline shows that aired thirty-nine stories? A grand total of... zero! South Africa in the bad old days was more integrated than Dateline during sweeps! How about 48 Hours'? There was a show called \"It's Just Sex,\" about what Dan Rather called \"The New Sexual Revolution.\" There wa s a show about doctors who lake unnecessary risks with their patients. And the re were plenty of murder shows: a \"seventy-seven-year-old grandmother hot on the trail of a killer\"... \"newlyweds murdered in their small hometown\"... two unsolved murders that we will \"Never Forget\"... and \"A 48 Hours Mystery\" abo ut a woman charged with murdering her own mother. Blacks? None in the entire sweeps month. Not one. S ame as Dateline. 20/20 had stories about: a serial killer...a scorne d wife and the \"temptress\" who stole her husband... a guy who gets shot out of a can-non ... a doctor who carved his initials on a patient... a rape victim t ry-ing to keep her attacker in prison... a young man charged with killing his b est friend in the desert... a pedophile... an alleged thief who swindled insuranc e companies... and a girl who killed her mother, \"a daughter's dark side.\" Of the twenty-six stories 20/20 ran on ten hours' w orth of shows, two of the main characters were black. One of the stories was about Secretary of Defense William Cohen and, as Barbara Walters put it, \"his stunning wife Janet,\" who is black. As I watched I couldn't help but think that if she wasn't so stunning - which she most certainly was - 20/20 might not have found her interesting enough to put on TV during sweeps. And then there's 60 Minutes, the show that marches to its own drummer. 60 Minutes was on four times during sweeps with twelve sto-ries. Seven of them featured black people as main characters. About five months later, in its October 2000 issue, Brill's Content did a story about two black producers who quit their jobs at Da teline because they were convinced that stories about black people were seen by network news executives as \"not marketable.\" As part of the story, Brill's Content conducted the same survey as I did during the May sweeps and came up w ith the same numbers. But Brill went a step further. Its reporter also su rveyed the same news magazine shows in June, a less important month because sweep s had already ended. The author of the piece, Robert Schmidt, found an inter esting difference. Dateline, which had no blacks on in May, had three \"blacks in key roles\" in June, out of sixty stories. 20/20, which had two blacks on in May, had eight ma jor black char-acters on in June, in forty-two stories. 48 Hours, which had no blacks on in May, had four o n in June, in forty stories. And 60 Minutes, which had seven black main characte rs on during sweeps, had two on in the fifteen stories it ran in June. The Brill's Content piece also pointed out that ove r the years, \"Each one [of the news magazine shows] has done solid stories on blacks or other minorities.\" America is a country where race only divides, Shelb y Steele wrote in The Content of Our Character. So maybe it's unreasonable to thi nk that TV news executives would do better in racial matters than presidents a nd senators and even well-meaning, everyday Americans have been able to do in the past. In the old days, on programs like 48 Hours, we did dark shows on crime and"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"punishment. And many of the characters we showed we re black. When crack was new, we showed black men selling it on street corners. When we showed young schoolgirls having babies, man y of the young schoolgirls we showed were black. When we showed suspects being handcuffed and loaded into police cars, the ones we showed were often black. But when we realized this emphasis on black people doing destruc-tive things was excessive, we went to the other extreme. To atone f or past sins, we tried not to show any blacks in a bad light. Such was the power of images, we believed, that showing even one black man in handcuffs would someh ow slander all black men. And when TV news magazines began to clone themselve s in the 1990s, when we saw what a gold mine they were, we became very prac-tic al. We made secret, unofficial pacts - understandings, really, that did n't need to be formalized with anything more than a knowing look, if that - to marginalize blacks and other minorities and, of course, poor people, no ma tter what color they were. This wasn't about sensitivity anymore, or political correctness. It wasn't about not wanting to show certain Americans in a bad ligh t. It was about not wanting to show certain Americans at all, if we could get a way with it. Edward R. Murrow's \"Harvest of Shame,\" the great CB S News doc-umentary about poor migrant families traveling America, trying to sur-vive by picking fruits and vegetables, would never be done today. Too many poor people. Not our audience. We want the people who buy cars and compu ters. Poor migrants won't bring our kind of Americans - the ones with money t o spend - into the tent. This is how the media's \"Liberals of Convenience\" operat e. These are the people who can spot a bigot a hundred miles away. But what the y refuse to see is that they're the ones behaving just like Archie Bunker w hen he found out the Jeffersons were moving next door. Archie didn't rea lly dislike black people. They just made him feel... uncomfortable. And besid es, they brought property values down in the neighborhood, didn't they? What' s a guy to do? The Liberals of Convenience don't dislike blacks. O r Hispanics. Or poor people. Quite the opposite. They like them very much - in t heory. They just don't want too many of them on their TV shows. This is what ha ppens when entertainment and news get too chummy, when the so-called values of o ne become the values of the other. This is how the game is played in the shallow money trench and the plastic hallway. The Most Important Story You Never Saw on TV It's true. I am a Renaissance man. For this I thank television news, because television news has kept me informed and in-the-kno w about all the important and significant events of our time, things that any Ren aissance man must know. For example, I know that if the glove doesn't fit, I must acquit. I know that if you're a man, you don't want to sleep anywhere near a woman named Lorena Bobbitt, especially if you might have offended her in some way. I know a lot about Joey Buttafuoco. In fact, I know much more about Mr. Buttafuoco than I care to know. I know that America's delicate princess on ice skat es, Tonya Harding, said it was Jeff Gillooly's idea to whack Nancy Kerrigan ac ross the knees and that Jeff said Tonya knew a lot more than she was letting on. Yes, I know all that and"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"much more, thanks to television news. I know so muc h about Elian Gonzalez that for weeks before it finally happened, I was rooting for the U.S. government to send him back to Fidel Castro's communist dictatorship just so I wou ldn't have to listen to his cousin Marisleysis anymore. And of course I know just about everything about Jo nBenet Ramsey, except for that pesky part about who killed her. In fact, the reason I know that JonBenet and O. J. and Tonya and Jeff and Joey and Amy and Lorena and John and Elian and Marisleys is and Versace and Princess Di are among the most important and significant sto ries of our time is because TV news, according to my estimate, ran a hundred mi llion hours of stories about them. Back in the 1950s, Ed Murrow told us that TV could go in one of two directions: it could teach, illuminate, and even inspire us, he said, or it could be nothing more than wires and lights in a box. Let's be real generous and say the jury is still out on that one. But while important journalists were falling all ov er themselves try-ing to land the big interview with the Ramseys or O. J. - in TV talk they call this the \"get\" - while Katie and Connie were sending fruit b askets and handwritten notes hoping to get the get, they all missed another pret ty big story. Maybe not as big as Barbara Walters's interview with Mel Gibson, but pretty big nonetheless. This was the story about the terrible things that a re happening to America's children. The one outlined in a brilliant Policy Re view essay entitled \"Home-Alone America\" by the social scientist Mary E berstadt. Ms. Eberstadt writes, \"The essence of home-alone America is just this: Over the past few decades, more and more parents have been spending l ess and less time at home, and most measures of what social scientists call 'c hild well-being' have simultaneously been in what once would have been ju dged scandalous decline.\" Or we can put it another way: as more and more moth ers have opted for work outside of the house over taking care of their chil dren at home - and not always for economic reasons - the results have been disast rous. While, thanks to TV news, I know all sorts of thing s about the afore-mentioned Joey Buttafuoco, I did riot know that between 1979 and 1988 the suicide rate for girls aged ten to fourteen rose 27 percent. And for boys it went up a frightening 71 percent. Neither did I know that between 1980 and 1997, the number of sex-ual abuse cases in America increased by 350 percent, some of the ri se due to the changing mandatory reporting laws, but also, as Mary Ebersta dt reports, \"Here, too, a connection to home-alone America seems undeniable. For while children do risk abuse at the hands of bio-logical parents, they are much more likely to be abused by a cohabiting male who is not biologically related... [and] that in order for predatory males (and they are almost alwa ys males) to abuse, they must first have access; and that the increasing absence from home of biological moth-ers... effectively increases the access of wou ld-be predators.\" Thanks to TV news, I knew that John Wayne Bobbitt h ad surgery to attach his detached you-know-what, but I didn't know that a so ciologist named Arlie Russell Hochschild discovered that \"a study of nearly five thousand eighth-graders and their parents found that children who were home alo ne for eleven or more hours a week were three times more likely than other childr en to abuse alcohol, tobacco"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"or marijuana.\" To which Eberstadt adds: \"There is a lso the related question of what those hours of uninterrupted access to the vio lence and pornography of the Internet are doing to adolescents nationwide.\" Neither did I know that, according to the National Center for Health Statistics, in 1970 fewer than 5 percent of girls under age fif teen had had sex. Today, about one out of every three girls that age is havi ng sex. And I didn't know that researchers had found that some three million teenagers are affected with a sexually transmitted disease - each year. Television news did tell me that American students don't do as well academically as kids in some other advanced countries. And I rem em-ber stories about how this is probably because of economic and cultural factor s. But one other possible explanation didn't get much coverage. It's the one that says while kids need help with their homework, in many American homes, n obody is there to provide that help since both mom and dad are at work. While I knew that Korean and Japanese kids, general ly speaking, score higher than American kids on standardized tests, the eveni ng newscasts never shared with me the fact that the scholar Francis Fukuyama looked into this and concluded, \"Part of the reason that chil-dren in bo th societies do so well on international tests has to do with the investments their mothers make in their educations.\" It's not that there's been a television news blacko ut on all the bad things happening to our kids; we do get a story here about teen suicide and one there about test scores. It's just that the elite journal ists in net-work television have no desire to connect the dots. They don't repo rt the really big story - arguably one of the biggest stories of our time - t hat this absence of mothers from American homes is without any historical prece -dent, and that millions upon millions of American children have been left, as Eb erstadt puts it, \"to fend for themselves\" - with dire consequences. In the mid-1990s, the Census Bureau estimated that about two in ten American kids between the ages of five and fourteen - about 4.5 million of them - were \"latchkey children,\" which is defined by the bureau crats as those who \"care for self\" outside of school. Except many of them are not caring for themselves v ery well. They have fallen into a kind of pit of emptiness and alienation. Wha t's espe-cially noteworthy is that this decline in their well-being has been hap- pening at the same time that more and more mothers have decided to leave home fo r the workplace. Why has this story become such a taboo as far as the network tel evision elites are concerned? Why have the evening newscasts tiptoed around the m ost sensitive of all issues involving children - the day-care issue - going out of their way to accentuate the positive and deemphasize the negative? \"Among married women with preschool children under the age of six,\" the sociologist Andrew Hacker wrote in the New York Rev iew of Books, \"fully seven in ten now have paid employment.\" Not all of them work full-time and not all of them leave their children with strangers in day-car e centers. Still, as Hacker tells us, this represents \"a new approach to mother hood,\" one in which \"most [women] are dis-inclined to make caring for their c hildren their primary occupation.\" This is a truly remarkable statement. \"Most [women] are disinclined to make"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"caring for their children their primary occupation. \" But appar-ently this monumental change in how we live our lives and rais e our children is not nearly as monumental to TV journalists as finding out who killed JonBenet or trying to learn, as we were in much of 2001, \"Where's Chandra ?\" \"Of all the explosive subjects in America today,\" M ary Eberstadt writes, \"none is as cordoned off, as surrounded by rhetorical lan d-mines, as the question of whether and just how much children need their paren ts - especially their mothers.\" The subject \"is essentially off-limits fo r public debate,\" she writes. But why? Eberstadt, being a scholar, comes up with some scholarly explanations. Partly, it's because divorce has become so commonpl ace in America, she says, that \"a sizeable majority of Americans have tacitly , but nonetheless decidedly, placed the whole phenomenon [of kids being without their mothers at crucial times of the day] beyond public judgment.\" She's probably right, but I've come up with several other reasons why this major event of our time has produced a great big yawn, at least as far as TV news is concerned. One is that national TV reporters, as a group, are lazy. I know this is a generalization, and I know that Mark Twain said gen eralizations aren't worth a damn, but it's generally true nonetheless. \"There's no culture of ideas around here,\" one CBS News executive told me, meaning hard ly any of his reporters ever look out at the bigger American culture and wonder why certain things are happening and come up with some-thing resembling an original story. These reporters and producers cover news conferences and plane crashes and hurricanes and easy stuff like that. But, despite an occasiona l scoop out of Washington, even this executive doesn't expect too much serious journalism out of his people, the kind that actually requires some work. The second reason is equally \"benign.\" Unlike O. J. and JonBenet and Chandra and the Bobbitts, stories about the loneliness and sadn ess of children and what happens when they don't have parents around, aren't sufficiently mysterious or sexy, two of the major ingredients that go into a g ood story in the often shallow world of television news. The media do get interested, of course, when one of these latchkey kids shoots up his school and kills a few students and teachers. But this interest doesn't stem from some journalistic curiosity about the empty lives of many latchkey kids - after all, most latchkey kids don't go on killing sprees. Rather, it comes from the cold f act that dead kids in the school cafeteria make for what they like to call \"g ood TV.\" The third reason is a little trickier and has to do with the similarities between network anchormen and politicians, both of whom from time to time must go to their constituents for votes in order to keep their jobs. Here's what I mean: while a congressman asks for your vote every two years, and the president every four years, and a senator every six years, an chormen ask for your vote five nights a week. As with politi-cians, if you do n't believe they understand and sympathize with you, there's a good chance you' ll vote for the other guy. If working mothers are the majority, and if they are \" disinclined to make caring for their children their primary occupation,\" then running stories about how badly their children are doing is not going to be p opular, is it? Especially given that the not-so-subtle implication is that wo rking mothers aren't doing a very good job raising their children. That implicat ion might first induce guilt"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"(which probably isn't too far below the surface), b ut then morph into anger. That anger will be aimed squarely at the messenger, and the TV newsman or woman who delivers the story will be seen as uncaring and unsympathetic to the plight of work-ing moms. This is not a good way to get vot es, Nielsen or otherwise. Or as Brian C. Robertson put it in his book, There' s No Place Like Work, \"A good deal of the neglect [of the troubling data on day c are and latchkey kids], no doubt, derives from the reluctance... of many aca-d emics and opinion leaders to be seen as hostile to the social advance-ment of wo men.\" There is, I think, one more reason, closely tied to that fear of being seen as hostile to women-as-underdog-working-mothers. It is that the media elites will not take on feminists. Feminists are the pressure g roup that the media elites (and their wives and friends) are most aligned with . Feminists tend to see any discussion that raises tr oubling questions about latchkey kids or younger children in day care not a s an opportunity to learn and discuss something important, but as an out-and-out attack on women and the freedoms they've won since the 1970s. That fear is not completely groundless. Because it is true, as Eberstadt writes, that \"Once ... staying home with one's children was judged the right thing to do, both int rinsically and for reason of the greater good, by mothers, fathers, and most of the rest of society. Today, the social expectations are exactly reversed.\" But that doesn't mean that reasonable people who wo rry about what's happening to our children are calling for a return to the old da ys, when women - partly because of custom and partly because of sex discrim ina-tion - stayed home all day, preferably in the kitchen, preferably baking c ookies. One can be in favor of women's advances and still be concerned about th e attendant costs, especially when the costs are borne by chil-dren. If the media were open-minded, there would be a true debate about this issue. Instead, w e get the usual suspects on the TV screen who call for more \"quality\" day care and for legislation that would give working mothers easier access to foreign nannies and for laws that would guaran-tee more paid maternity leave. These a re all policies that would make it easier for working moms to continue working and spend less time with their children. Why don't we get to see intelligent voices that would reverse that equation and say that it's more important for more women to spend more time with their children and not bring in a second incom e? Over the years I have seen many stories about day c are, and I have come away with the impression that most mothers who work pret ty much have to work in order to make ends meet. But it turns out that isn't so. Many, in fact, work outside the house because \"they prefer to arrange their liv es that way,\" as Eberstadt puts it: Here is where a genuine cultural revolution in moth erhood can be said to have occurred. It is of course true, and has been true f or all time, that significant numbers of women do leave children at home out of g enuine necessity, whether for reasons of poverty, divorce, failure to marry in th e first place, low edu-cational attainment, and other familiar constra ining facts of life.... Yet just as it is obvious that many women work beca use they must, it is also obvious that genuine material constraints do not be gin to account for our contemporary rate of maternal absence - far from it .... Indeed: If the latest social science analyses prove anything, it is that more and more women are working outside the home not bec ause they \"must,\" but because"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"they prefer to spend those hours there - and are in creasingly inclined to acknowl-edge the fact. \"Must\" and \"need,\" as anyone knows, are exceed-ingly elastic concepts where individual desires are conce rned. Robert Rector of the Heritage Foundation found that \"nearly 80 percent of the preschool children using any form of day care come from married-couple families with two income earners.\" I don't remem-ber ever he aring that on the network news. Katha Pollitt, the feminist, has written, \"Th e truth is, the day-care debate has always been about college-educated worki ng moms.\" I don't remember hearing that either on the nightly newscasts. But i t makes sense. As anyone who lives in a middle-class neighborhood anywhere in th is country knows, a lot of people think they \"must\" work outside the house bec ause they \"need\" a certain six-figure lifestyle, or, for the sake of their san ity, they \"need\" to be around grown-ups doing some kind of work that is more crea tive than changing diapers and talking baby talk. That is for them to decide. Every year or so we see m to get another study on day care - this one saying it's good for kids, the next one say-ing it's not so good. I'm confused and my guess is that not too man y adults go into therapy because their mother dropped them off at day care w hen they were four years old. But in any case, this is not an argu-ment for or ag ainst mothers leaving the house to work in an office or a factory. That is no t my concern, despite the troubling statistics, at least relating to latchkey children. The argument here is that once again the elite jour nalists on televi-sion have taken sides. Too many day-care centers in America a re not as good as they ought to be, they and their \"experts\" frequently tell us, so the challenge is to spend more government money to subsidize day care and to make it better. I am not against \"better day care,\" and I have no problem wi th the evening news doing stories about how that might be done. The problem i s that they don't let the other voices on. The ones who say that most toddler s are better off with their own mothers than with day-care workers and that mos t adolescent kids would do better if a parent were home after school instead o f being alone and \"fending for themselves.\" In May 200J, Rich Lowry offended feminists from Mai ne to Cali-fornia when he wrote in the conservative National Review, \"Work ha s, in post-feminist America, become central to the identity of women (and child- rearing doesn't count). Work is an act of historical redemption for all those ce nturies of oppression and sexism, so that sounding at all skep-tical about it is to be identified with those former forces of darkness. When negative day- care studies appear, there's a palpable worry, not that the children are endange red, but that women's careers are.\" He was writing in response to a government study on day care that came out in April 2001, and concluded that toddlers who are put in day care for long stretches of time tended to be more aggressive and defiant, regardless of the quality of the day care. The study was done by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and says that 17 perce nt of kids who are left in day-care centers for more than thirty hours a week argue a lot, demand a lot of attention, act cruelly, show explosive behavior, ta lk too much, and get into lots of fights. So would Tom and Peter and Dan use this study to la unch a serious discussion about whether some kids might be better off with mo m at home? Or about whether"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"dads should be paid a \"family wage\"? Or about how t his report is a vindication for stay-at-home moms? No. On CBS, Dan Rather called the study \"controversial\" - twice. This seems like a good time to point out that whenever you hear an an chor-man or reporter use the word \"controversial,\" it is usually a signal that t he idea that follows is one the media elites do not agree with. But why would a study that concludes what sounds li ke plain old common sense - that some very young children behave aggressively w hen they're away from their mothers for long stretches of time - be considered controversial? Because such a conclusion is guaranteed to make many of those work ing mothers - especially the better educated ones from two-hefty-income househol ds - feel guilty. And this is something the anchor-politicians cannot do for fear of looking unsympa-thetic and losing their Nielsen vote. Which is why such a study's find-ings are described as \"controversial.\" This is how Dan opened his evening newscast that ni ght in April: \"A controversial call to working parents: A new study claims child day-care often leads to behavior nightmares.\" Then a few seconds l ater: \"Good evening. The millions of parents who dropped their children off at day care this morning have something important to think about tonight: A new s tudy that makes controversial claims about the impact of day care.\" On NBC, Rober t Hager also found the study \"controversial.\" On the Nightly News he reported, \" Today a controversial new report claims a downside, says preschoolers sent to day care become somewhat more aggressive than others, experience more behavi oral problems by the time they get to kindergarten.\" Two days after the report came out, on CBS's Saturd ay Early Show, we got another \"controversial\" take on the study. Co-host Russ Mit chell, introducing the story, said, \"CBS News correspondent Cynthia Bowers has mo re on these controversial findings that are bound to worry work-ing parents.\" Russ was absolutely right: the conclusion that some kids behave badly when they spend long hours in day care would surely worry wor k-ing parents. But what Russ left out was that many of those working par-ents we re working right there alongside him in the newsroom. Let's remember that while Russ Mitchell and Dan Rather and Robert Hager aren't working mothers, the y work with a lot of women who are, and as Dan might put it, those gals got a dog in this fight. America's newsrooms are filled with women who drop their kids off someplace before they go to work or leave them at home with the nanny. These journalists are not just defending working mothers - they're defending thems elves! And it's not just working moms. Many of those suppo sedly objective journalist dads who write about day-care studies also have a d og in the fight. Many of them want their wives to work. Like many media elites, t hese people would rather swallow shards of glass than vacation with \"red sta te\" Americans in a place like, say, Branson, Missouri, one of the most popul ar tourist spots in the entire United States. So if they encour-age, or per haps even insist, that their wives leave little Adam or Nicole at home with a na nny or at day care with some \"caregiver,\" and she goes to work and earns a secon d paycheck, then they can take a nice vacation - not in the Ozarks - but may be in Paris. And they can also live in a bigger house and drive something a l ittle fancier than a Chevy or a Ford."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"The feminist response to any \"controversial\" news a bout day care is to call for more federal laws and subsidies to improve the qual ity of day care. Which is why Dan invited the president of the Children's Defense Fund, Marian Wright Edelman, on his evening newscast the night the study came ou t to tell the audience that the answer to the day-care prob-lem was - surprise! - more federal laws and subsidies for better day care. The federal governme nt, Ms. Edelman said, should \"put into place the kind of quality, comprehensive system and sets of choices that many other industrialized countries have.\" In other words, if it's good enough for Sweden, it ought to be good enough for t he United States. Over at ABC, Peter Jennings was thinking the same t hing. After a news report on the day-care study, Peter offered up some thoughts. \"Federal law,\" he said, \"only requires companies with fifty or more workers to give new mothers twelve weeks' leave - and without pay, at that. The U.S. i s actually the least generous of the industrialized nations. In Sweden, a new mot her gets eighteen months of maternity and parental leave, and she gets 80 perce nt of her salary for the first year. Mother or father can take the parental leave any time until a child is eight. England gives eighteen weeks' maternity l eave. For the first six weeks, a mother gets 90 percent of her salary from the government and $86 a week thereafter. German women get two months of fully pa id leave after giving birth. The government and the company kick in. And either parent has the option of three full years in parental leave with some of the ir salary paid and their jobs protected. And finally, in Canada, new parents can take up to a year of leave. Depending on how much they make, they get from 55 t o 80 percent of [their] salaries.\" Forget for a moment that Peter was sounding like he was delivering a not-so-stealthy editorial for laws to make it easie r for parents to leave their kids in day care. That aside, aren't there any voic es we might hear from the other side, from all those women who would rather n ot work outside the home, who would rather spend more time with their chil-dren, and who would like to see their political leaders fight for tax cuts so that they could work less and not have to drop the kids off at day care or leave them home alone after school? In fact, this is exactly what Steve Forbes said whe n he was running for president in 1996 and arguing that his flat tax wou ld give parents \"more time to spend with their children and with each other.\" But no one brought Forbes on as another intelligent voice to go along with Marian W right Edelman. No one at CBS News thought the issue was worth debat-ing. The \"co ntroversial\" study merely needed to be \"corrected\" by Edelman. Why is one point of view valid and the other nonexi stent on the evening news? Maybe because a few years earlier the same CBS News mocked the very idea that Forbes put forth in his presidential cam-paign, wit h the CBS News correspondent characterizing it as \"Forbes's number one wackiest flat tax promise.\" On network TV, given the prevailing sensibilities t hat reign there, voices that argue for policies that would make it easier for mo ms to drop their kids off at day care are considered thoughtful, compassionate, and reasonable. But voices that argue for less day care, because day care is b ad for kids - frankly, I don't think the media elites even know such voices exist. In his National Review piece, Rich Lowry writes tha t there is a ten-dency \"in academia and the media to find a way to pronounce a nything associated with day care - up to and including infectious illness... a good thing, so as to shield"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"working mothers from any bad news.\" [Emphasis added .] He's not kidding. Even germs are turned into good n ews when it comes to day care. Lowry was referring to research done by David Murray of the Statistical Assessment Service in Washington, D.C. A study in t he New England Journal of Medicine in August 2000 found that kids who attende d day care in their first six months were less likely to have asthma at age thirt een. The theory was that by being exposed to so many germs and infections so ea rly, the kids developed resistance. The big-time media loved the story. The Boston Glob e announced, \"Day Care May Gird Children Against Asthma.\" The headline in the Washington Post said, \"Day Care May Boost Immunity to Asthma; Early Exposure t o Germs Is Cited.\" The New York Times ran this glee-ful headline: \"Day Care, f or Keeping Asthma at Bay.\" CNN ran a big story, complete with an \"on camera\" e nding in which the reporter, Christy Feig, passed along the good news: \"Parents who may worry about their children getting sick from other children can now r elax a little. It may benefit them down the road.\" But Murray points out an inconvenient fact that mig ht have toned down those headlines. \"The dramatic rise in the number of children attend ing early day care,\" he writes, \"exactly coincides with the epidemic rise o f childhood asthma....Childhood asthma more than doubled betwee n 1980 and the present [October 2000], just as did the pattern of working parents choosing early day care. Hence, positing a cause and effect relationship between day care and reduced asthma faces a formidable hurdle.\" Still, despite the questionable evidence that day c are really does keep asthma at bay, CNN and the big newspapers loved the story precisely, one could argue, because it was \"good\" news about day care. But now look at how the media handled another study about germs and infectious diseases i nvolving children and day care - this one not so good news. In October 1999, the Journal of the American Medica l Association analyzed hospitalizations due to respiratory infections amon g American kids between 1980 and 1996. Murray writes, \"The study examined res-pi ratory syncytial virus (RSV), which causes more lower respiratory tract infection s among young children than any other pathogen. They found that the rate had in creased substantially, and argued that the true scope of the problem had been previously underestimated.\" David Murray then writes that the \"associated facto rs were multiple, but quite prominently mentioned was the effect of day care. A s the study notes, Attendance at a child-care center with six or more other child ren is an independent risk factor for [a] lower respiratory tract disease hosp italization in the first two years of life....A trend toward earlier enrollment in large child-care centers may lead to initial RSV infection at a younger age, whe n hospitalization is more likely. Specifically child-care practices must be e xamined in relation to bronchiolitis hospitalization trends.'\" \"The research,\" Murray concludes, \"appearing in a m ajor medical journal, offered a clear warning sign about the consequences of emer g-ing social practices [putting young children in large day-care centers]. \" So how did the media play this one? They didn't. Murray says, \"The press reaction was s trangely muted. A Lexis-Nexis search found only a 450-word Associated Press synop -sis... but the wire story"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"was picked up by no newspaper....The stark fact is that news accounts of any research positing a negative health out-come attrib uted to day care are few and far between.\" I ran a Lexis-Nexis search, too, and found only two very brief men-tions on network television: fifty-one words on the CBS Morn ing Show and seventy-three words on the Today show. Both were items read by th e news anchors. Neither CBS nor NBC sent a reporter out to actually cover the s tory. And I could find nothing on any of the evening newscasts. Maybe the media elites are right not to throw this kind of had news in the face of working moms, who feel bad enough as it is, even though some of them obviously would feel worse if they had to stay at h ome with their kids. \"Career moms,\" Rich Lowry says, \"need such coddling for a r eason. Mothers who choose to work full-time jobs and routinely leave their young children with others for much of the day are not nor-mal: They are a histori cal aberration; they represent a minority prefer-ence among women; and t hey run exactly counter to the standard of motherhood that should be encourage d by society. No wonder elite cul-ture treats them as hothouse flowers, who must hear nary a discourag-ing word. But the fact is that working moms are at the very center of a variety of cultural ills. Maybe a little stigma is what they d eserve. \"We are willing to do anything 'for the children,'\" Lowry says, \"except suggest that their mothers should stay with them; we are co m-mitted to 'leaving no child behind' unless it is by his mother hustling off to make her career.\" You won't hear that voice on the evening news, eith er. And because we don't hear that voice on the evening news, television news has kept its viewers ignorant of one of the biggest and most impor-tant social changes of our times. Marjorie Williams of the Washington Post gave voice to media elite opinion when she wrote that she lives \"with the knowledge that i n pursuing my work, I am to some degree acting selfishly.\" But at the same time , she hopes she will eventually be able to explain to her five-year-old that \"what I do at that desk [at the newspaper] feels as necessary to me as food or air.\" To which Mary Eberstadt adds: \"These are evocative words in more ways than one. They are the sort of things mothers have also said about their c hildren.\" Liberal Hate-Speech If arrogance were a crime, there wouldn't be enough jail cells in the entire United States to hold all the people in TV news. A network correspondent told me that once, but when he found out I was writing a bo ok he got amnesia. Not only couldn't he remember ever saying such a subversive thing, but if by some insane chance he had - which he hadn't, of course - he did n't want any credit for it. No problem. Except that when network news correspondents are af raid to say even something as harmless as that out loud, there's not much chance they'll take on more serious problems, which then leaves the field wide open to idiots like me or, more ominously, to the real pros... the conservative med ia watchdogs that monitor every second of network news in order to document e very single example of liberal bias, real or imagined. Such an organization is the Media Research Center, based in Alexandria, Virginia, right outside Washington, D.C. Every mont h or so MRC mails a"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"newsletter to reporters and anchors and other sages in the big-time national media. \"Notable Quotables,\" they call it, is chock- full of \"the latest outrageous, sometimes humorous, quotes in the lib-e ral media.\" They also put out a daily report online called CyberAlert, which MRC says tracks media bias. You'd think this exposure, before your own colleagu es no less, might cause a certain amount of embarrassment, especially when th e example of bias is especially egregious. Dream on. Network corresponde nts don't embarrass easily. It's easy to dismiss \"Notable Quotables,\" because p rofessional lib-eral bashers compile it. But the right-wing scoundrels at the Me dia Research Center have come up with some good stuff. What follows are some of t he more noteworthy examples, from the last ten years or so, of how journalists o n the Left see the world. • \"Some thoughts on those angry voters.

Dan Rather was giving his opinion on a radio talk show. Peter Jennings didn't liken the American voter to an angr y two-year-old on the World News Tonight. He did it in a radio commentary, a pl ace he's allowed to give his opinions. John Chancellor wasn't reporting the news when he made his absurd observation that the problem in the old Soviet Unio n wasn't communism, but shortages. He was doing commentary. Liberals have as much right to be downright silly a s anyone else. But I doubt Peter would have gone on a rant if liberal Democrat s had been swept into office instead of conservative Republicans. I doubt he wou ld have compared Americans voters to a bunch of babies having temper tantrums had they voted for people more to Peter's liking and the liking of his Manhat tan pals. But there is something interesting about how libera ls in the media can get away with making certain observations that conservatives never could. Nina Totenberg says, \"[I]f there's retributive just ice, he'll [Jesse Helms] get AIDS from a transfusion, or one of his grandchildre n will get it,\" and she remains a member in good standing of the liberal me dia elites. What if a conservative journalist such as Fred Barn es of the Weekly Standard had said, \"If there's any justice in this world, Teddy Kennedy will drive off a bridge late at night and kill himself. Or one or tw o of his kids.\" He would rightly be considered a contemptible hatem onger whose every word on every subsequent subject would be scrutinized for t races of venom, and it wouldn't be long before other journalists would mar -ginalize him. USA Today columnist Julianne Malveaux says of Clare nce Thomas, \"I hope his wife feeds him lots of eggs and butter and he dies early like many black men do, of heart disease,\" and she gets invited back on TV tal k shows all the time. If Robert Novak, the conservative columnist and CNN commentator, had said, \"I hope Jesse Jackson's wife feeds him lots of eggs an d butter and he dies early like many black men do, of heart disease,\" he'd rig htly be seen as a nasty right-wing nut and compared to the Grand Wizard of the KKK. Newsweek's Evan Thomas cavalierly calls Paula Jones \"some sleazy woman with big hair coining out of the trailer parks,\" and he's se en as a pundit instead of a liberal elitist snob. Can anyone in his right mind really imagine a conse rvative journal-ist of Evan Thomas's stature ridiculing a not-too-sophisticated , not-too-educated, young black or Hispanic woman, as someone \"with big hair coming out of the ghetto\"? Bonnie Erbe tells Linda Chavez on PBS that she's go t a greater chance of being struck by lightning than being raped - at her age. If Brit Hume had said something so incredibly insen sitive and so downright"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"stupid (which I know he never would), NOW would hav e screamed that, like so many men, he just doesn't get it, that rape is not about sex, but about power and control, and then, just to set an exam-ple, the pre sident of NOW would have led a contingent to hang Brit Hume in effigy, or maybe in the flesh. They would have thrown a mil-lion pickets into the crusade to get h im off the air, and they'd all be marching around Fox headquarters in New York and Washington chanting \"Brit's a Twit and He's Got to Go.\" Quicker than yo u can say \"male chauvinist pig\" Brit Hume would become an embarrassment to Fox and a pariah in the world of big-time journalism. But when a liberal says it on PBS, no big deal. Cha vez is a conserva-tive after all - and the sin of all sins, she says things Hisp anic women aren't supposed to say. White liberals hate it when minorities do that . So, ipso facto, she's fair game. Why is it that when liberal media stars say nasty t hings they're merely sharing their thoughts with us and (even more important) th eir feelings, but when the same sentiment comes out of a conservative's mouth, it's seen as mean-spirited? After Bill Clinton was impeached, Newsweek's Eleano r Clift (\"Eleanor Rodham Clift,\" in some circles) said, \"That herd of manage rs from the House, I mean, frankly, all they were missing was white sheets.\" Likewise, the Arkansas Times editorialized that \"Ke nneth Starr is cunning, ruthless, and about as well-mannered as Heinrich Hi minler.\" On January 15, 1999 - Martin Luther King's birthday - the Los Angeles Times published an op-ed by \"frequent contributor\" Karen Grigsby Bates who spewed the following: \"It is a totally visceral reaction, but whenever I hear [Republican Senate majority leader] Trent Lott speak, I immediately th ink of nooses decorating trees. Big trees, with black bodies swinging from t he busi-ness end of the nooses.\" This is vile. Maybe it went over big with what they like to call \"the creative community\" in Los Angeles, but it is vile hate spee ch no mat-ter how you cut it. And what of the Los Angeles Times, the newspaper th at published it? The Times is nothing if not a monument to political correctness, so much so that an op-ed page editor yanked a line from a syndicated George Will column that said, \"I think it is reasonable to believe that [Bill Clinto n] was a rapist.\" This offended the sensibilities of the Times editor. Lin king a United States senator to the likes of Ku Klux Klan murderers, however, ap parently falls into the category of nothing to get worked up over. The media elites, at the Los Angeles Times and ever yplace else, can hear even the whispers of what they consider hate speech fift y miles away - whether they imagine that it's coming from conservative talk sho w hosts or right-wing religious fundamentalists or just about anyone oppo sed to affirmative action. But they can't hear it dripping off their own nasty tongues... and probably think \"liberal hate-speech\" is an oxymoron. It's a good thing arrogance isn't a crime. \"The Ship Be Sinking\" Back in 1982, when a reporter asked New York Knicks guard Micheal Ray Richardson what the problem was with his last-place team, he o ffered up a succinct"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"analysis. It consisted of just four simple words, b ut in the world of sport it has been enshrined. \"The ship be sinking,\" Micheal Ray said, rivaling \" To be or not to be\" for sheer elegance and beating it by two words for utter succ inct-ness. And that would have been the end of it, except that another report er asked a follow-up question. \"How far can it sink?\" Micheal (that's how he spells his name) considered the question, then put forth another four-word masterpiece. \"The sky's the limit .\" Move over, Mr. Shakespeare, there is a new Bard in our midst, These days another ship is taking on water. The network news divi-sion s' own flagship: their evening newscasts. To assess the damage just look at the Scoreboard - the Nielsen ratings. In the 1979-80 season, 75 percent of all TV sets th at were on in the early evening were tuned to a network news program, eithe r ABC, CBS, or NBC. Seventy-five percent! But twenty-one years later, in 2001, the share of t he audience watch-ing network news had sunk all the way to 43 percent. If the networks were selling shoes instead of news, they'd be out of business by now. How far can the evening news ratings sink? Looks li ke the sky's the limit. The numbers get worse every year. In the 1994-95 season , for example, 51 percent of Americans with TV sets on were watching Dan or Pete r or Tom. In 1995-96 it was 50 percent. For 1996-97 and 1997-98, it was 49 perc ent. Then it slipped to 47 percent; by the end of 2000, it was 44 percent; and in July 2001,43 percent. When Walter Cronkite handed Dan Rather the baton in spring 1981, the CBS Evening News was in first place. Twenty years later, CBS wa s in last place, having lost more than half its ratings. The ABC and NBC nightly newscasts, during the same period, didn't do as badly, but their ratings plummeted, too. With each passing year, the national evening newsca st, as an American institution, is becoming less and less relevant. Bu t that's not entirely the fault of the evening stars. Not by a long shot. Ove r the years, an inconvenient reality cropped up that Dan and Tom and Peter had n othing to do with and had no power to stop. Today, there are cable and satellite TV and the Internet, competition that Cronkite and Huntley and Brinkley didn't even have to think about. It's as if the Berlin Wall had come down. But inste ad of voting with their feet, Americans began voting with their remote control de vices. They haven't abandoned the news. Just the news people they no longer trust . How else can we account for Hill O'Reilly and The O 'Reilly Factor on the Fox News Channel. O'Reilly is currently the hottest anc hor on the hottest news and information program on cable television. The Washington Post did a profile and said O'Reilly was \"cable TV's ascendant talk star.\" Newsweek did a big spread - the \"Life of O'Reilly,\" they called it - that says he makes more than a million dollars a year and has \"the highest-rated cable-news program on TV.\" He wrote a book, The O'Reilly Factor, that was a Ne w York Times number-one bestseller for ten weeks."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"And as far as I'm concerned, the three people Bill owes so much of his success to are Tom Brokaw, Peter Jennings, and Dan Rather. People will get their news from the people they lik e and believe, which is very bad news for the old guard. Consider a poll (of 822 randomly selected Americans ) conducted by Brill's Content and published in its March 2000 issue. Seventy-four percent of Republicans believe that mo st journalists are more liberal than they are. No bulletin, there. You'd ex pect Repub-licans to think that way. But, as the magazine puts it, \"Perhaps more surpris ing, Democrats also perceive a liberal media tilt: 47 percent believe that most journalists are more liberal than they are....\" Here's where the bad news comes in for Rather, Jenn ings, and Brokaw. The poll finds what seems to be at least a circumstantial li nk between viewers' noticing \"a liberal media tilt\" and their defection to cable . \"And just as their overall broadcast entertainment ratings have dropped, broadcast-television network newscasts are losing t o cable channels, especially those cable channels with name brands in particu-la r news categories.\" I spoke to Bill O'Reilly about this just before Chr istmas 2000, and he told me his viewers \"perceive Rather and those guys as bein g left, but even more, they see them as being elitist, as not being in touch wi th them.\" Of course, there's a good chance that a lot of the defectors from ABC, CBS, and NBC nightly news are going to O'Reilly because, no matter what they say about wanting a fair, down-the-middle newscast, what they really want is a program with a conservative tilt. I'm sure that a lot of O' Reilly's fans are right of center, that some are angry white males and females , live in the red states, and voted for George W. Bush. No one is confusing Bill O'Reilly with Bill Moyers, or Fox with PBS. But whenever I tune in to The O'Reilly Factor, I he ar opinions and arguments about the news of the day coming from the right and from the left. And this, I think, is what throws the critics of O'Reilly and F ox. They're just not used to hearing so many diverse views on TV, most of them f airly intelligent. This is how Roger Ailes, O'Reilly's boss at Fox New s, explained it in a New York Times Magazine piece in June 2001: \"There are more conservatives on Fox. But we are not a conservative network. That dis-parity say s far more about the competition.\" In other words, if Fox is alleged to have a conservative bias, that's only Because there are so few conservative v oices on the air at ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, and MSNBC. Roger definitely is on to some thing, but so are the critics. There cer-tainly is a conservative \"attitu de\" at Fox, a conservative sensibility. Why else would so many conservatives b e watching shows like The O'Reilly Factor? When I spoke to Bill, he pointed to a favorite Aile s example of how ABC, NBC, CBS, and CNN frame the debate on a big issue like a bor-tion. \"They exclude voices in America like crazy,\" he told me. \"You don 't see an articulate spokesman who's pro-life on the network evening new s-casts. They'd rather show someone who just shot up an abortion clinic.\" So how does Bill O'Reilly, the man Newsweek calls t he \"Fox News phenom,\" assess the future of Messrs. Rather, Brokaw, and Jennings? \"It's like the last days of Pompeii. They're desper ately trying to hold on. They"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"see the smoke.\" Or to put it another way: the ship be sinking. Right after my op-ed came out, Mike Wallace was ask ed by a freelance reporter in Washington, \"What is your reaction to CBS News repo rter Bernard Goldberg's charges of liberal bias in the media?\" Mike replied, \"When people suggest there is a bias in the media and we have all this power and then of course the bias is always su pposed to be liberal and not conservative, well then, under those circumstances how many Democratic presidents and how many Republican presidents have there been beginning with Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan twice, George Bush. It's just in my estimation, it's almost a joke.\" I think Mike Wallace is great, but in this case the joke's on him. Just because Americans, starting in 1980, elected R epublicans pres-ident four times (Reagan twice, Bush and Bush) and Democrats o nly two times (Clinton twice) doesn't prove, as Mike seems to think, that there's no liberal bias. A more likely explanation is that TV news view-ers simply aren't influenced by the bias they're being fed from network anchors and reporter s whom they lost trust in a long time ago. Besides, the problem of bias is not that the big ne twork news divisions are reliably pro-Democratic... or even predictably anti -Republican. It's about how they frame the big issues of the day - feminism, ab ortion, race, affirmative action, even taxes. On these issues they are reliab ly and predictably left of center. John Leo captured it in a 1997 column: Having worked in many newsrooms, I can tell you tha t most reporters are honest and try hard to be fair, but they are keenly aware of the conventional narrative line on most con-troversial and recurring stories. They know how such stories are expected to be handled and how newsroom rewards and punishments tend to follow certain kinds of treatment. In his 1990 Los Angeles Times stories on abortion coverage, David Shaw explained how reporte rs could expect a challenge from colleagues when they tapped out a story that g ave even indi-rect aid and comfort to anti-abortion forces. Angry white male stories tend to attribute any oppo sition to affirmative action to social intolerance, backlash, and personal fears . Here's the opening section of a segment last year on NBC's Dateline dealing wi th two academics who got ' California's Proposition 209 on the ballot: \"Do you feel that everyone is after your job... that people can criticize you and it's OK? Are you a white American male... the beleaguered species?\" Intended to be ja unty and cute, the opening was simply snide. All it really showed is that the people at Dateline had difficulty imagining any principled opposition to r ace and gender preferences, possibly because such opposition is unknown on the Dateline staff. John Leo and I have talked many times about the nat ure of bias in the newsroom, about how it is not some sinister plot, but about h ow mostly liberal journalists tend to frame stories from a mostly liberal point o f view.   In my experience, I've noticed that liberals often see America as a dark place populated by all sorts of bigots who can't wait to bash one minority or another. They see America as more antigay than it is, and mo re racist than it is. They see America as \"slouching towards Gomorrah,\" but no t the way conservatives see"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"it. The view from the flight is that America has become too uncivil and too vulgar. Conservatives believe that over the years, as Ameri ca became more tolerant, it became indiscriminately tolerant. Accepting minorit ies is progress. Accepting dopey sex jokes on TV sitcoms at eight o'clock at n ight is not progress. From the Left, incivility and vulgarity are in the eyes of the beholder. And besides, they say, it's a sign that we've become mo re open and hon-est about things. They point to the fact that Lucy and Ricky slept in sepa-rate beds and couldn't even use the word \"pregnant\" on their TV s how. \"Is that what we want?\" they ask, implying that anyone who thinks things ha ve gone too far in the direction of Howard Stern is some sort of prude. Th e real menace, as the Left sees it, is that America has always been too willin g to step on its most vulnerable - gays, women, blacks. Because the Left controls America's newsrooms, we get a view of America that reflects that sensibi lity. This is how John Leo put it in his column: \"Polls s how a large major-ity [of Americans] have reservations and conflicted feeling s... when it comes to gay marriage and any teaching in the schools that amoun ts to an endorsement of homosexuality. In the newsroom, of course, all this is viewed as nonsense and homophobia. The upshot is that because of newsroom framing, the real national conversation on homosexuality is not really being r eported. It is off the table because of the narrow view of the story in terms of prejudice.\" It's the same when it comes to race. \"Journalists tend to feel that bigotry is widesprea d in America and they are primed to see it quickly when their counterparts in the lobby-ing world send in their reports. This explains why stories about alle ged racial slurs among Texaco executives and the wave of church burnings in the S outh were still being framed as bias news long after the evidence showed that th is framing was wrong. This media tilt has the effect of discounting the real g ains of out-groups and depicting the country as much more prejudiced than it really is....-It's one reason why so few people trust the press.\" And it's why the ship be sinking. Connecting the Dots....to Terrorism Most of the time television is nothing more than a diver-sion - proof, as the old quip goes, that we would rather do anything tha n talk to each other. We'd also rather watch a bad sitcom than read a good boo k. Bad sit-coms get millions of viewers; good books get thousands. In an \"enter- tainment culture,\" even the news is entertainment. Certainly too much local new s has been pure fluff for some time now, with their Ken and Barbie anchors wh o have nothing intelligent to say but look great while they're saying it. And bec ause network news is losing viewers every year, executives and producers are tr ying to figure out ways to hold on to the ones they still have. They think cos metics will work, so they change the anchor desk or they change the graphics. They get the anchor to stand instead of sit. They feature more \"news you can use .\" They put Chandra Levy on all over the place, hoping they can concoct a ratin gs cocktail by mixing one part missing intern with ten parts sex scandal. Arid then something genuinely big and really import ant happens that shakes us to our core, and all those producers who couldn't get enough of Chandra are through with her. Only in the fickle world of television ne ws can someone who has"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"disappeared without a trace dis-appear a second tim e. And it's when that history-making story comes along that Americans - no matter what their politics, religion, age, race, or sex - turn to television, not just for information, but also for comfort and for peace of mind. It doesn't happen often, but when it does, television becomes a lot m ore than just a diversion. It happened when John Kennedy was assassinated. We all turned to Walter Cronkite and Huntley and Brinkley, not just for facts, but a lso for reassurance - that despite the terrible tragedy, America was going to be okay. It happened when Challenger blew up. And it happene d again on September 11, 2001, when a band of religious lunatics declared wa r on the United States of America to punish us for not wanting to dwell in th e fourteenth century, where they currently reside, and, of course, to show the world that their intense hatred of Israel - and of Israel's friends - knows no bounds. On September 11, they not only killed as many inno-cent Americans as they could in the most dramatic way they knew how, but, as the Wall Street Journal put it, they also \"wiped out any remaining illusions that America is safe from mass organized violence.\" On that day we all turned to television. We turned to Dan Rather and Peter Jennings and Tom Brokaw and the others. And they di d a fine job, as they often do when covering tragedy. They showed empathy. They were fair and accurate, and the information they passed along to us wasn't filt ered through the usual liberal political and social sensibil-ities. They g ave us the news on that day the way they should give us the news all the time, whether the story is about race or feminism or taxes or gay rights or anything else. For a change, they gave it to us straight. On the night of September 11, 2001, Peter Jennings made a point about how, in times of danger and tragedy, television serves the function that campfires used to serve in the old days when Americans migrated we stward in covered wagons. Back then, they would sit around the campfire and g et the news from other travelers about what they should look out for down the road. \"Some people pulled the wagons around,\" Peter said, \"and discussed what was going on and tried to understand it.\" But the campfire was more than just a meeting place where families could pick up important information. The c ampfire also provided a sense of community, a sense that we're all in this togeth er. That's what television was on September 11. As I listened to Peter tell that story, I thought a bout another American tragedy that shocked us six years earlier, when Timothy McV eigh - another true believer who cared nothing about killing inno-cent Americans - blew up the federal building in Oklahoma City. I thought about how it t ook some of the media elites only a few days before they started to play one of their favorite games - connect the dots. What they found back then - or mo re accurately, what they con-vinced themselves they found - was a line stret ching from Oklahoma City to the Republican Party to conservatives in general an d finally to Rush Limbaugh. Dan Rather said, \"Even after Oklahoma City, you can turn on your radio in any city and still dial up hate talk: extremist, racist , and violent from the hosts and those who call in.\" Time senior writer Richard Lacayo put it this way: \"In a nation that has entertained and appalled itself for years with hot talk on radio and the campaign trail, the inflamed rhetoric of the '90s i s suddenly an unindicted"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"coconspirator in the blast.\" Nina Easton wrote in the Los Angeles Times, \"The Ok lahoma City attack on federal workers and their children also alters the once-eas y dynamic between charismatic talk show host and adoring audience. Hosts who routinely espouse the same antigovernment themes as the militia movement now must walk a fine line between inspirin g their audience - and inciting the most radical among them.\" On Face the Nation, Bob Schieffer asked this questi on: \"Mr. Panetta, there's been a lot of antigovernment rhetoric, it comes ove r talk radio, it comes from various quarters. Do you think that that somehow ha s led these people to commit this act, do they feed on that kind of rhetoric, an d what impact do you think it had?\" Carl Rowan, the late columnist, was quoted in a Was hington Post story saying that, \"Unless Gingrich and Dole and the Republicans say 'Am I inflaming a bunch of nuts?' you know we're going to have some more ev ents. I am absolutely certain the harsher rhetoric of the Gingriches and the Dole s... creates a climate of violence in America.\" And David Broder had this to say in the Washington Post: \"The bombing shows how dangerous it really is to inflame twisted minds wit h statements that suggest political opponents are enemies. For two years, Rus h Limbaugh described this nation as 'America held hostage' to the policies of the liberal Democrats, as if the duly elected president and Congress were equiva lent to the regime in Tehran. I think there will be less tolerance and fewer chee rs for that kind of rhetoric.\" The message was clear: Conservative talk radio and conservative politicians created an antigovernment atmosphere in America tha t spawned Timothy McVeigh and therefore were at least partially to blame for his terrorism. It's true, of course, that the atmosphere in which we live contri butes to everything that happens in our culture. Calling people \"kikes\" or \" niggers\" makes it easier to see them as less than human and to treat them as so mething less than human. But to point fingers at talk radio for somehow encourag ing Timothy McVeigh strikes me as a stretch at best; more likely it's just anot her opportunity for liberal journalists to blame conservatives for one more evi l. And if this kind of connecting the dots is fair game, then should we al so accuse Americans who spoke out loudly and forcefully against the war in Vietna m - including many journalists of contributing to the 1972 bombing of the Pentagon and to other sometimes deadly terrorism, per-petuated by fanatic s on the Left? According to the media elites' rule-book, when liberals rant it' s called free speech; when conservatives rant it's called incitement to terror ism. As I watched the coverage of the attacks on the Pen tagon and the World Trade Center, I wondered why I hadn't seen more stories o n tel-evision news, long before these zealots flew their hijacked planes int o American buildings, about the culture of anti-American hate that per-meates s o much of the Middle East - stories that might help explain how little Arab chi ldren can grow up to become fanatical suicide bombers. If the media found it so important to discuss the m alignant atmo-sphere created by \"hot\" conservative talk radio, then why didn't t hey find it important to delve into this malignant atmosphere that seems to have bred such maniacal killers? Why would journalists, so interested in co nnecting the dots when they"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"thought they led to Rush Limbaugh, be so uninterest ed in connecting the dots when there might actually be dots to connect - from hateful, widely held popular attitudes in much of the Arab world straight to the cockpits of those hijacked jetliners? One of the networks put an American Muslim woman on the news who said that no one blamed Christianity when McVeigh killed all tho se people. Why blame Islam now? The reporter interviewing this woman let her h ave her say, never bothering to point out that Timothy McVeigh didn't kill all t hose people in the name of Christianity. Suicide airplane hijackers, on the ot her hand, are people who actually believe their murderous acts will earn the m a one-way ticket to Paradise. Was what happened on September 11 a subversion of I slam, as pun-dits and journalists on network and cable TV told us over an d over again? Or was it the result of an honest reading of the Koran? It's true , of course, that if taken too literally by uncritical minds, just about any h oly book can lead to bad things. Still, why are there no Christian sui-cide bombers, or Jewish suicide bombers, or Hindu suicide bombers, or Buddhist suic ide bombers, but no apparent shortage of Muslim sui-cide bombers? If Islam is \"a religion of peace\" as so many people from President Bush on down were tellin g us (and, for what it's worth, I'm prepared to believe that it is), then wh at exactly is it in the Koran that so appeals to these Islamic fanatics? Don't lo ok for that answer on the network news. A Lexis-Nexis search going back to 19 91 linking the words \"Koran\" and \"terrorist\" produced absolutely nothing that to ld us what the Koran actually says which might encourage a Muslim, no matter how misguided, to commit acts of terrorism. I understand that even to ask questions about a pos sible connection between Islam and violence is to tread into politically inc orrect terrain. But it seems to me that the media need to go there anyway. And a ny net-work that can put thousands of stories on the air about sex and murde r should be able to give us a few on the atmosphere that breeds religious zealotr y. It might have helped us see what was coming on September 11. In fact, I learned much more about the atmosphere t hat breeds sui-cide bombers from one short article in Commentary magazine than I have from watching twenty years of network television news. In its September 2001 issue (which came out before the attack on America), there was an article by Fiamma Nirenstein, an Italian journalist based in Israel, entitled \"How S uicide Bombers Are Made.\" In it, she tells about a \"river of hatred\" that runs t hrough not just the most radical of Arab nations but also much of what we li ke to think of as the \"mod-erate\" Arab world. She tells us about a series of articles that ran in the leading government-sponsored newspaper in Egypt, Al Ahram, about how Jews supposedly use the blood of Christians to make matzah for Passover . She tells us about a hit song in Cairo, Damascus, a nd the West Bank with the catchy title \"I Hate Israel.\" Why didn't I know this? A computer check .soon answ ered my ques-tion. On television, only CNN reported the \"I Hate Israel\" s tory. On radio, NPR did a piece. So did the Christian Science Monitor and the Chicago Tribune, The Los Angeles Times ran a short wire service story that s aid '\"I Hate Israel'... made an overnight singing sensation of a working-class c rooner.\""},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"Can you imagine if the big hit song in Israel was \" I Hate Palestine\" or \"I Hate Arabs\"? The New York Times would have put the story on page one and then run an editorial just to make sure we all got the message - that the song is indecent and contributes to an atmosphere of hate. And since the Times sets the agenda for the networks, Dan Rather, Tom Brokaw, and Peter Jennings would have all fallen into line and run big stories on their eveni ng newscasts, too, saying the exact same thing. A week later, Mike Wallace would have landed in Tel Aviv looking absolutely mortified that those Jews would do such a thing. And that's part of the problem. Despite the liberal ism of the media, there is a subtle form of racism at work here. As Fiamma Niren stein writes, \"The Arabs, it is implicitly suggested, are a backward people, not to be held to civilized standards of the West.\" Of the Israelis, how-ever, the American media expect much more. That is why a song called \"I Hate Israel \" becomes a big hit, and yet is not a news story. And it is why a series of stor ies in a government-sponsored newspaper - in a supposedly moderate country - abou t Jews killing Christians for their blood holds almost no interest for American j ournalists. It's true that not long after the twin towers of th e World Trade Center came tumbling down, the networks showed us pictures of P alestinians in East Jerusalem honking their horns, firing their guns into the air , and generally having a good old time celebrating the death of so many Americans in New York and Washington. They cheered \"God is great\" while they handed out c andy, which is a tradition in the Arab world when something good happens. It's not that there's been a total news blackout of anti-American hate in the Middle East - Nightline has done some good, intelli gent work in this area - it's just that we need more than pictures of happy Pales tinians reveling in the death of thousands of Americans. And we need more than wh at has become a staple of Middle East television news coverage: young childre n throwing stones at Israeli soldiers - the perfect made-for-television David an d Goliath story. What we need are stories that connect the dots, not just back to Afghanistan and its backward and repressive Taliban government, but also between the fanatics in New York and Washington and a cultural environment in the Arab w orld where even \"moderates\" hand out candy to celebrate the massacre of America ns. But here the media - apparently feeling squeamish a bout stories that put the \"underdogs\" in a bad light - keep us virtually in t he dark. And it's not just little tidbits like \"I Hate Israel\" and articles ab out Jews taking Christian blood that I - and almost all Americans - knew noth ing about. Here's a quick rundown of what goes on in much of the Middle East as reported by Ms. Nirenstein in Commentary - news that is virtually ignored on t he big American TV networks: In Egypt and Jordan, news sources have repeatedly w arned that Israel has distributed drug-laced chewing gum and candy, inten ded (it is said) to kill children and make women sexually corrupt.... [Palestinian television] recently asserted that, fa r from being extermination camps, Chelmo, Dachau, and Auschwitz were in fact m ere \"places of disinfection.\" On April 13 - observed in Israel as Holocaust Remem brance Day - the official Palestinian newspaper Al-Hayat al-Jadida featured a column... entitled \"The Fable of the Holocaust.\" A columnist in Egypt's government-sponsored Al-Akhb ar thus expressed his \"thanks to Hitler, of blessed memory, who on behalf of the Palestinians took revenge in"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"advance on the most vile criminals on the face of t he earth. Still, we do have a com-plaint against [Hitler], for his revenge on the m was not enough.\" In addition to these examples, Ms. Nirenstein cites a textbook for Syrian tenth graders which teaches them that \"the logic of justi ce obli-gates the application of the single verdict [on the Jews] from which ther e is no escape: namely, that their criminal intentions be turned against them an d that they be exterminated.\" And she notes that in June 2001, two weeks after th e fatal collapse of a Jewish wedding hall in Jerusalem, Palestinian television b roadcast a sermon by a Muslim imam praying that \"this oppressive Knesset [Israel' s parliament] will [similarly] col-lapse over the heads of the Jews.\" I did not know any of that because it's simply not the kind of news that we normally get from the Middle East - certainly not f rom network evening newscasts or from Dateline, 20/20, or 48 Hours, three news ma gazine programs that are usually too busy peddling the trivial and sensation al to bother with more significant stories. And besides, that kind of news makes liberal journalists uneasy. After all, these are the same people who be nd over backwards to find \"moral equivalence\" between Palestinian terrorists who blow up discos in Tel Aviv filled with teenagers, on the one hand, and Is raeli commandos who preemp-tively kill terrorist ringleaders before the y send their suicide bombers into Israel on a mission to kill Jews, on the other . On September 11, right after the networks showed us the pictures of Palestinians celebrating American deaths, they also showed us Ya sser Arafat expressing his condolences and giving blood for the American victi ms. This, in its way, represented a kind of moral equivalence: while some Palestinians celebrate, the news anchors were suggesting, their leader does not ; he is somber and, we're led to believe, absolutely shocked. But we could have d one with a little less moral equivalence on the part of the press and a little m ore tough journalism. Someone should have asked the leader of the Palestinian peo ple if he understood that the cultures that he and other \"moderate\" Arab leaders preside over \"carefully nurture and inculcate resentments and hatreds again st America and the non-Arab world,\" as a Wall Street Journal editorial put it. And if that's asking too much of a field reporter covering a seem-ingly shaken an d distraught Arafat in the wake of September 11, then an anchor back in New Yo rk should have wondered out loud about that very connection. But to have asked such a question might have been v iewed as anti-Arab (and therefore pro-Israeli), and reporters and anchors w ould rather be stoned by an angry mob in Ramallah than be seen in that light. S o we didn't learn that day if Chairman Arafat quite understood his role in the ce lebration he so deplored. Nor did we get an explana-tion on the news about why th ere were not thousands of other Arabs in the streets - on the West Bank or in Jerusalem or in the \"moderate\" Arab countries - expressing their condol ences. Was it because they are afraid to show support for American victims of terrorism? Or was it because they, like the Palestinians we saw with great big s miles, didn't feel that bad about what happened? If the networks can give us months and months of Ch andra and JonBenet and Lorena Bobbitt and Joey Buttafuoco, then they can give us more than they do about the river of hatred that breeds suicide bombers. But this is where journalists - given their liberal tendency to empathize with, and sometimes even root for, the \"underdog\" - run i nto a big problem: if they"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"start to connect those ideological and reli-gious d ots, they may not like what they find.

But it should be obvious that a place that turns \"I Hate I srael\" into a hit, that runs stories in its most important newspaper about Jews killing Christians for their blood, that faults Hitler only because he did not k ill more Jews, and that celebrates the murder of thousands of inno-cent Ame ricans is a place populated by many nasty people. Perhaps it has many good peop le, too, who just don't want to get involved. The point is, a story about all of this is at least as important as a story about Anne Heche and her sex l ife, even if sex does better in the ratings than disturbing news about raw, igno rant hatred in the world of Islam. None of this is an argument that the media are inte ntionally pro-Arab. Rather, like the U.S. State Department, they are pro \"moral equivalence.\" If they connect the dots with stories on the news about hit songs called \"I Hate Israel\" and all the rest, the Arab world will accuse the \"J ewish-controlled\" American media of being sympathetic to \"Israeli oppression.\" If journalists - who were so willing to connect the dots when there was a belief that they led to Rush Limbaugh - con-nected these dots, they might find t hat there are a lot fewer moderates in those moderate places than they keep t elling us about. So they look the other way, which, as Ms. Nirenstei n tells us, is not that easy. One has to turn \"a determinedly blind eye to this r iver of hatred... [and] to be persuaded that, after all, 'everybody' in the Middl e East really wants the same thing.\" Obviously, there are legitimate issues about which there are differing viewpoints in the Middle East: Should Israel blow u p the houses that belong to the families of terrorists? Should Israel allow the construction of new settlements on the West Bank? These are two that co me quickly to mind. But moral equivalence and the quest for evenhanded journalism should not stop the media from telling us more - much more in my vi ew - about the kind of backwardness and hatred that is alive and well, not just in places like Kabul and Baghdad, but in \"moderate\" cities and villages all over the Arab world. Even if it means going against their lib-eral sensibilit ies and reporting that sometimes even the underdog can be evil. I know it sounds crazy, but I think Dan is caught i n a time warp, living in a land where Richard Nixon is still president. And st ill out to destroy him. Watergate, Vietnam, lying, obstructing justice, hus h money. Nixon was up to his eyeballs in trouble, and Rather was all over him. I t's true that he wasn't Woodward or Bernstein - broadcast people almost nev er are - but Dan Rather was the toughest television guy on the beat, and every night on the CBS Evening News, Walter Cronkite would introduce a Rather piec e, and Dan would hammer Nixon. Whether it was the trademark Nixon paranoia or mere ly his charm-ing"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"vengefulness, the president and his palace guard de spised Rather and called CBS brass more than a few times to see if they could ge t him transferred from the White House to someplace like Outer Mongolia. CBS w ouldn't buckle, and Rather - the blue-collar kid whose daddy dug ditches - wasn' t about to go weak in the knees and fold. He just got tougher. But along the way I think he also became cynical an d suspicious of any criticism. \"Dan Rather can't distinguish between ma instream, legit-imate criticism and criticism coming from extremists. It' s all the same to him,\" is what Heyward told me after my op-ed came out. .And after the dark days of Richard Nixon, when Dan was constantly under siege, I believe he started seeing even well-meaning criti cs as ene-mies. Anyone who said there was a liberal bias on our news broadcast s was an extremist, practically by definition, as far as Dan was concer ned. Every critic was a Richard Nixon lining Dan up in his sights. I think a little of Nixon's paranoia rubbed off on Dan. In my own dark days after the op-ed, while I was wa iting to find out if I had a job or not, I had a conversation with Jon Klein, th e number two in command at CBS News, about why Dan - a guy who could be so kin d and so funny and so generous - could also be so unforgiving. Rather had been telling people he would \"never\" forgive me. Never! And while I understood h e wasn't going to throw a party to thank me for writing the op-ed, \"never\" se emed a bit extreme. I mean, Rather has embraced people a lot worse than me. He practi-cally kissed Fidel Castro in front of the whole evening news sta ff when the dictator showed up at CBS News studios on West 57th Street in the f all of 1995. Castro was in New York for the fiftieth anniversary of the signin g of the United Nations Charter, and since CBS News was trying to get into Cuba to do a documentary, the brass invited Fidel over to show him that they were good guys who could be trusted. Never mind, for a moment, the irony that A merican journalists felt they had to prove to a communist dictator that they coul d be trusted. This was business. So there they were, the two media grandees, Dan and Fidel, touring the studio where Dan does the evening news each night, smiling , laugh-ing, bantering, looking like old pals who hadn't seen each other in years. Dan even gave Fidel a nice little gift - a baseball bat, because Fidel, a s everyone knows, loves baseball. In the old days, he actually was offered a contract lo play for the New York Giants, which he turned down, in the words of one reporter, \"to become a communist free agent instead.\" But when you think about it, all the smiles and all the laughs - business or no business - makes a lot of sense. After all, to a lo t of liberals, Fidel isn't a communist dictator. I mean, technically he is. They know, for example, that he hasn't allowed a free election in the last forty ye ars or so, that he doesn't tolerate dissent, and that he'd rather drink batter y acid on the rocks with a touch of lime than allow a free press. Mere technic alities. The way they see it, to describe Fidel Castro simply as a dictator is so ... uncool comes to mind. To the cognoscenti - especially the liberal cognoscent i in the media - Fidel is a celebrity. So what if he doesn't toler-ate freedom of the press? That doesn't mean an American newsman can't like the guy, does i t? Castro - who locks people up if they look at him fu nny - The Dan embraces. Me - I write a little op-ed piece calling the media elit es a bunch of lefties, and -"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"he'll \"never\" forgive. Go figure. Jon Klein, like Rather, thought I had crossed the l ine with my op-ed, and in terms of etiquette Jon and everybody else were abso lutely right. Miss Manners would never approve of what I had done. But Klein w asn't apoplectic over it the way Rather and a lot of the others were. So I asked him what it was about Rather that could make him so implacable when he thought y ou crossed him. \"You have to understand that Dan Rather is Richard Nixon,\" Jon told me. \"If he sees you as an enemy even for a second, you're an e nemy for life. And like Nixon, Rather must destroy his enemies.\" The irony didn't escape Klein. This time it was Rat her - just like his nemesis Richard Nixon two decades before - who was confusin g dis-sent with betrayal, even treason. \"Now Rather has become what he detested,\" Jon told me. After the op-ed came out, cracks didn't appear in t he earth, airplanes didn't drop out of the sky, people didn't riot in the stre ets, the stock market didn't crash, and the sun kept coming up in the east. This was all working in my favor. Then out of the blue, I got a boost from none other than Michael Jordan. Too bad it wasn't the basketball player Michael Jordan. Tha t would have gotten me out of the doghouse once and for all. The Michael Jordan w ho took my side, unfortunately, was only the chairman of Westinghous e, the company that owned CBS at the time. Tech-nically speaking he was Dan's and everyone else's boss - but in the halls of CBS News, Michael Jordan wasn't suc h a big deal. Jordan did an interview in US Air Magazine, of all places, and said, \"I think his [Goldberg's] criticism is fair. I think all the networks can do a better job at providing a more objective and balanced perspect ive. Goldberg's account was inspired not so much by the content as by the patro nizing tone of the coverage. That's very typical when somebody criticizes someth ing like the flat tax. I think it's wrong, because a high percentage of the American public has been lectured to since the early sixties and is a little fed up with it.\" The Michael Jordan interview had little to do with it, but soon after-ward, the powers that be at CBS News decided to take me back. Indeed, about two months after I wrote that \"the old argument that the netwo rks and other 'media elites' have a liberal bias is so blatantly true that it's hardly worth discussing anymore,\" I was back on the job. But my agent at the time, Richard Leibner, whose bi ggest client is Dan Rather, warned me that it's never the same after such turmo il, that the bad blood lingers for a very long time. He was right. Before the blowup I had started doing opinion piece s for Dan's evening newscast. \"Analysis\" is what they technically called it becau se the word \"commentary\" made them nervous. This was going to be a very prestigio us assignment, mainly since only Eric Sevareid and Hill Moyers had done analysi s on the evening news before me. But when Heyward took me back he said no more comme ntary because \"you might be seen as a conservative balance to an otherwise libe ral broadcast... and since the evening news isn't a liberal broad-cast, we can 't let you do analysis anymore.\""},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"There is a technical word to describe this kind of reasoning. The word is \"horseshit.\" So, I did some straight reporting for the evening n ews, but mainly I bounced around on prime-time magazine programs, the names o f which will be answers in trivia contests. Who will ever forget Coast to Coas t? Everybody! And when the last show I was on fell in the summer of 1998, Public Eye with Bryant Gumbel, I didn't know what was in store for me. My contract was coming up for renewal, and this wou ld be the per-fect time for CBS News to let me go, quietly, without the noise i t would have caused if they flat-out fired me right after the op-ed was publish ed. But there was a new magazine CBS News had just decided to do - a second 60 Minutes, 60 Minutes //, and even Andrew Heyward, the president of CBS News, said \"it was a no-brainer\" that I should be one of the correspondents. Except for one thing. Andrew said he wouldn't interfere with the decision of the show's new executive producer, Jeff Fager - the same Jeff Fager who ran the CBS Evening News when my op-ed appeared and who had been one of its many critics. I met with Fager in his office on West 57th Street in New York on August 11,1998, at Andrew's urging. A meeting couldn't hur t, Andrew figured. We talked about the new show for a while, but I sensed a ten- sion during the conversation, so I asked if there was a problem. Yeah, he said - the Wall Street Journal piece. \"I'll never be able to put that behind me,\" he said. \"Never?\" I said to him. This was the same word Rather was using, saying lie would \"never\" forgive me for what I had done. It was no secret that when Dan Rat her sneezes, Jeff Fager (and every other executive producer who works for Dan) c atches cold. And since Dan was the lead correspondent on the new 60 Minutes 77 , and since Fager was using the very same language Dan was using, I knew I was a dead man walking. \"But I won't let that [the op-ed] influence my deci sion,\" he said, as our meeting was ending. I was about to say, \"Then why the fuck did you just bring it up,\" but I knew that wouldn't help my chances of getting on the sho w. Still, I knew, as Texas Dan might have phrased it, that my chances were som e-place between slim and none - and slim just left town. Fager said he would keep me in mind for one of the correspondent slots, which we both knew wasn't true. A month later, on September 15, 1998, he made it official. Fager called me at home in Miami and said I would not be on the show. It's true: payback is a bitch. That's when I decided that I would no longer let an y of them con-tinue to punish me. Day in and day out, they would scrutinize polit icians and business people and doctors and lawyers and put what they found on television for millions to see. But they would \"never\" let me off the hook for scrutinizing them. What a bunch of hypocrites, I kept thinking, these people who examine anybody and everybody's life but will \"never\" forgive me fo r writing about their liberal bias. The Dan Rathers of the world don't try to crush you if they think you're full of crap. They simply ignore you. It's when you taunt t hem with the truth that they get really frantic and try to inflict pain, if for no other reason than to show everybody else in the newsroom that the cost of bre aking the sacred code of omerta will be very high."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"Reinhold Niebuhr, the American theologian, might as well have been talking about thin-skinned evening news stars when he said, \"Fran tic orthodoxy is never rooted in faith but in doubt.1' Dan's frantic orthodoxy, h is supposed certainty that anyone who accuses the media elites of having a lib eral bias must be a right-wing political activist, is rooted not in his faith that he's right, but in his doubt that maybe, just maybe, the critics ar e on to something. I didn't want to work at CBS News anymore. And it w as pretty clear they didn't want me. I asked for a meeting with Heyward, and tw o days after Fager told me I wouldn't be on 60 Minutes 77,I met with Andrew in h is office in New York and told him I would leave CBS News and never show my f ace again if he would let me stay until May 31, 2000, when my pension would kick in. He agreed to let me stay on, accepting my resignati on and making no effort to keep me at CBS News. So in the summer of 2000,I lef t after twenty-eight years. On July 4, 2001, there was a ray of sunshine. Peter Jennings told the Boston Globe, \"Those of us who went into journalism in the '50s or '60s, it was sort of a liberal thing to do. Save the world.\" Obvious, ye s, but it's important that Jennings actually said it. Publicly. But even more important is what he said regarding t he question of fairness and balance. \"Conservative voices in the U.S.,\" Peter a cknowl-edged, \"have not been as present as they might have been and should have been in the media.\" Given that this came out on the Fourth of July, may be it would be the beginning of a revolution. Maybe Dan and Tom and their report ers and producers would be next, admitting what millions of their viewers, pas t and present, have long known. And maybe they would use Peter's observation as an opportunity to think more deeply about their biases and, after all these years, start to make things right. But I'm not optimistic. The pattern by now is too i ngrained: some-one makes the liberal bias charge, the target of the accusation - Dan or Tom or some lesser star - denies it and accuses the accuser of having an agenda, or as in Peter's case - the most civil of the bunch - says that \"bia s is very largely in the eye of the beholder\" - even while he's admit-ting that the bias is very largely in the hands of the networks. It has become too visceral. Dan, the one I know the best, can't think seriously about the criticism since he's too busy taking it p ersonally, as an attack on his integrity, which it sometimes is but often is n ot. So how much has really changed? They continue to sl ant the news and then - Peter's media culpa notwithstanding - deny they're doing it. They are not lying. They just don't understand, which is precisely why they need to listen more carefully to the critics, especially the ones who c ome to them without political and ideological baggage. Now that I'm not part of the organization, I watch Dan only occa-sionally on the evening news, and I just smile. Why does he feel th e need, I wonder, to tell his audience about President Bush's \"Republican-right a genda\"? The man was in office less than a week and already Dan has spotted a \"Rep ublican-right agenda.\" Why, I wonder, did he never talk about President Clinton a nd his \"Democratic-left agenda\"? Why does Bob Schieffer tell us that John Ashcroft h as \"conservative views\" but that the organizations that opposed him during conf irma-tion hearings were simply a collection of \"rights groups\"? Why is it s o hard for Bob to put the"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"word \"liberal\" in front of \"rights groups\"? I watch the news, and Dan is mouthing words about C ongress or the president's tax plan - but it's just Newzak, the TV news versio n of ele-vator music.

All I can do is what millions of Americans have bee n doing for years. I take one last look at my good friend Dan, blow him a good-by e kiss, aim my remote right at his eyeball... and click the button marked \"off. \" Appendix A The Editorials Networks Need a Reality Check By Bernard Goldberg February 13,1996 Wall Street Journal There are lots of reasons fewer people are watching network news, and one of them, I'm more convinced than ever, is that our vie wers simply don't trust us. And for good reason. The old argument that the netw orks and other \"media elites\" have a liberal bias is so blatantly true that it's hardly worth discussing any-more. No, we don't sit around in dark corners a nd plan strategies on how we're going to slant the news. We don't have to. It comes naturally to most reporters. Which brings us to a recent \"Reality Check\" on the CBS Evening News, reported by Eric Engberg, a longtime friend. His subject was St eve Forbes's flat tax. It's not just Democrats and some Republican presidential candidates who don't like the flat tax - it's also a lot of big-time reporter s. The flat tax rubs them the wrong way. Which is fair enough - until their bias makes its way into their reporting. And Mr. Engberg's report set new standar ds for bias. He starts out saying: \"Steve Forbes pitches his fla t-tax scheme as an economic elixir, good for everything that ails us.\" Sure, th e words \"scheme\" and \"elixir\" are loaded, conjuring up images of Doctor Feel-good selling worthless junk out of the back of his wagon. But this is nothing more than a prelude - warm-up material to get us into the right frame of mind. The report shows Mr. Forbes saying the U.S. economy can grow twice as fast if we remove \"obstacles, starting with the tax code.\" Mr. Forbes may be right or wrong about this, so Mr. Engberg lets us know which it is . \"Time out\" he shouts in his signature style. \"Economists say nothing like that has ever actually happened.\" He then introduces us to William Gale of the Brooki ngs Institution, who says \"It doesn't seem plausible to think that we're going to have a whole new economy or economic Renaissance Age due to tax reform.\" CBS Ne ws instructs its reporters and producers to identify people in a way that will help the audience understand any political bias they might have. We are told, fo r example, to identify the Heritage Foundation as \"a conservative think tank.\" I have done this on more than one occa-sion, myself. It's a good policy. But where was the identification of the Brookings I nstitution as \"a liberal think tank\"? Might that influence Mr. Gale's take o n the flat tax? Instead, Mr. Gale was presented to America simply as an expert w ith no tax ax to grind. Mr. Engberg then shows Mr. Forbes saying: \"A flat t ax would enable this economy"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"to grow. That would mean more revenues for Washingt on.\" To this, Mr. Engberg tells the audience: \"That was called supply-side ec onomics under President Reagan: Less taxes equal more revenue. It didn't wo rk out that way.\" Immediately after this we hear Mr. Engberg ask this question of Mr. Gale: \"Is it fair to say the last time we tried something like this, we ende d up with these hideous deficits?\" To which Gale obediently replies, \"It's perfectly fair to say that.\" Mr. Engberg continues: \"And if we try it again, you r fear is... ?\" And Mr. Gale replies: \"... that we end up with the same problem again.\" But haven't other experts argued that we wound up w ith \"hideous deficits\" not because of the tax cut but because of increased spe nding? And to the best of my knowledge, neither Mr. Forbes nor any other flat-ta x proponent is suggesting we increase spending. (Part of the problem is that most reporters and edi tors - television and print - are total dunces when it comes to the economy. Most don't know a capital gain from a mutual fund. This, as much as bias, in some cases leads to the kind of reporting we see on the flat tax and a lot of other economic issues.) One thing to remember about network news is that it steals just about everything from print. So if the New York Times is against the flat tax, and the Washington Post is against the flat tax, the networks can't, a nd won't, be far behind. Mr. Engberg concludes his piece a la David Letterma n by saying that \"Forbes's Number One Wackiest Flat-Tax Promise\" is the candid ate's belief that it would give parents \"more time to spend with their childre n and each other.\" Can you imagine, in your wildest dreams, a network news reporter calling Hillary Clinton's health care plan \"wacky\"? Can you imagine any editor allowing it? Finally, Mr. Engberg says: \"The fact remains: the f lat tax is a giant, untested theory. One economist suggested, before we put it i n, we should test it out someplace - like Albania.\" \"Reality Check\" suggests the viewers are going to g et the facts. And then they can make up their mind. As Mr. Engberg might put it : \"Time out!\" You'd have a better chance of getting the facts someplace else-l ike Albania. Blowing the Whistle on CBS News February 15,1996 New York Post editorial page CBS News, which prides itself on its bold willingne ss to expose the dark secrets of corporate America, has apparently discov-ered th at the truth hurts. In Tuesday's Wall Street Journal, veteran CBS corre spondent Ber-nard Goldberg wrote a column on the political bias that informs n etwork news. Even though Goldberg said nothing even mildly controversial, hi s article has already ignited a firestorm at Black Rock. And what does Goldberg write that so outrages his c olleagues and superiors at CBS News? He notes, for starters, that \"the old argument that the net-works ... have a liberal bias is so blatantly true that it's hardly worth discussing anymore.\" Again, this amounts to rehearsing the obvious; it w ould be of little or no interest were it not for the fact of Goldberg's sta nding as a network news employee. He goes on to dissect the political slant of a CBS Evening News segment - broadcast by reporter Eric Engberg - on GOP candi-d ate Steve Forbes's flat-tax proposal. After noting that Engberg employed loaded language to influence the"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"viewer's perception Engberg's discussion of the tax plan included tendentious terms like \"scheme\" and \"elixir\" - Goldberg points out that Engberg allowed an analyst from the Brookings Institution to disparage the Forbes proposal without pausing to acknowledge Brookings's decidedly lib-er al orientation. This, apparently, represents a departure from stand ard practice at CBS reporters are meant to identify the political orientation of the analysts who appear or the institutions they represent. As Goldberg notes, it's hard to imagine a Forbes enthusiast from, say, the Heritage Foundatio n showing up on a newscast absent a comment to the effect that Heritage is a \" conservative\" think tank. Engberg, it seems, ended his piece by calling the f lat tax \"wacky.\" This prompts Goldberg to ask an uncomplicated question: \"Can you imagine, in your wildest dreams, a network news reporter calling Hillary Cli nton's health plan 'wacky'?\" Of course not. Engberg's segment - and this is Goldberg's larger m essage - bespeaks a wider syndrome. Night after night, the networks present t he news with a leftish tinge - sometimes to discredit the California Civil Right s Initiative (an anti-racial-quotas ballot measure); some-times to m isrepresent the GOP's Medicare reform plan. And most reporters don't even realize that their work is informed by ideological bias. CBS is working itself into a state of high dudgeon over Goldberg's decision to go public with his views. Evening News anchor Dan R ather \"deplores\" the whole situation. CBS News president Andrew Heyward is sai d to be livid. No one, however, appears ready to dispute the details in wh ich Goldberg's analysis is grounded. We can sympathize with the suggestion that trust wi thin a company is undermined when isolated individuals bare dirty linen in publi c. But it comes with little grace for CBS News to take refuge in this line of a rgument. After all, many Americans were introduced to the concept of corpora te \"whistle-blowers\" by CBS journalists. Only recently, 60 Minutes devoted an entire program to a former tobacco executive - \"Deep Cough\" - who chronicled the alleg ed misdeeds of his ex-employer. The show, in fact, made a point of ack nowledging \"Deep dough's\" courage and tenacity. At least Bernard Goldberg had the courage to identify himself by name. Meanwhile, it's worth remembering that whistle-blow ers can tell all kinds of truths. And it is just as important for the America n people to understand how bias taints the news disseminated by the major netw orks as it is for them to grasp the alleged inner workings of tobacco compani es. Here's to Bernard Goldberg, whose insights are espe cially valuable because they come from someone with intimate knowledge of the wa y the television news process works. On Media Bias, Network Stars Are Rather Clueless By Bernard Goldberg May 24,2001 Wall Street Journal Dan Rather has been on television more than usual l ately, popping up all over the place promoting his book about American success stories and along the way wearily denying that he's the left-wing devil some conservatives think he is. It's the same old story as far as Dan is concerned. The right thinks he's an unapologetic liberal who slants the news leftward - not because he is, but because his critics are so hopelessly biased themse lves that they wouldn't know"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"straight news when they saw it. As another evening star, Peter Jennings, told Larry King recently, bias often is in the eye of th e beholder. And since Tom Brokaw also has publicly denied a liberal bias, it' s official. There is none. It's all a figment of the reactionary imag-ination. Case closed. Except, as just about everyone who lives between Ma nhattan and Malibu knows, there is a leftward tilt on the big-three evening n ewscasts. A poll last year by Brill's Content showed that 74 percent of Republica ns spotted a liberal bias. No bulletin there. But 47 percent of Democrats agreed, believing that \"most journalists are more liberal than they are.\" So how can three otherwise intelligent, worldly men be so delusional when it comes to their own business? One possibility, of co urse, is that they're not delusional at all. They know they're slanting the n ews, and they're simply doing what a lot of people do when caught red-handed. The y're denying it. But that's not it, as far as I can figure. I'd bet that if you hooked Dan and Tom and Peter up to a lie detector and asked them i f there's a lib-eral bias on their newscasts, they'd all say \"no,\" and they'd al l pass the test. That leaves one other possibility. Messrs. Rather, Brokaw, and Jennings don't even know what liberal bias is. I concede this is h ard to believe, but I'm convinced it's why we keep getting these ridiculous denials, such as Mr. Rather's response to Geraldo Rivera the other night . Geraldo said, \"What I can't figure out is why you rub the right so wrong.\" Dan thought it was because some people \"subscribe to the idea either you report the news the way we want you to report it, or we're gonna tag... [a] negative sign on you.\" The problem is that Mr. Rather and the other evenin g stars think that liberal bias means just one thing: going hard on Republican s and easy on Democrats. But real media bias comes not so much from what party t hey attack. Liberal bias is the result of how they see the world. Consider this: In 1996 after I wrote about liberal bias on this very page, Dan was furious and during a phone conversation he indi cated that picking the Wall Street Journal to air my views was especially appal ling given the conservative views of the paper's editorial page. \"What do you c onsider the New York Times?\" I asked him, since he had written op-eds for that p aper. \"Middle of the road,\" he said. I couldn't believe he was serious. The Times is a n ewspaper that has taken the liberal side of every important social issue of our time, which is fine with me. But if you see the New York Times editorial page as mid-dle of the road, one thing is clear: You don't have a clue. And it is this inability to see liberal views as li beral that is at the heart of the entire problem. This is why Phyllis Schlafly is the conservative woman who heads that conservative organization but Patricia I reland is merely the head of NOW. No liberal labels necessary. Robert Bork is th e conservative judge. Laurence Tribe is the noted Harvard law pro-fessor. Rush Limbaugh is the conservative talk show host. Rosie O'Donnell is sim ply Rosie O'Donnell, no matter how many liberal opinions she shares with he r audience. And that's why the media stars can so easily talk a bout \"right-wing\" Republicans and \"right-wing\" Christians and \"right-wing\" Miami Cubans and \"right-wing\" radio talk show hosts. But the only time they utter the w ords \"left-wing\" is when they're talking about an airplane. Conservatives must be identified because the audien ce needs to know these are"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"people with axes to grind. But liberals don't need to be identified because their views on all the big social issues - from abo r-tion and gun control to the death penalty and affirmative action - aren't liber al views at all. They're simply reasonable views, shared by all the reasonab le people the media elites mingle with at all their reasonable dinner parties in Manhattan and Georgetown. Reporters pride themselves on their skepticism. Yet many uncriti-cally pass along the views of liberal activists in a way they would never do with conservatives. The homeless lobby tells the media t here are five million homeless, and ten minutes later it's on the evening news. Why is it that the media elites aren't nearly as cozy with the anti-af firmative action or pro-life lobbies? The media elites can float through their personal l ives and rarely run into someone with an opposing view. This is very unhealt hy and some-times downright ridiculous, as when Pauline Kael, for years the bri lliant film critic at the New Yorker, was completely baffled about how Richard Ni xon could have beaten George McGovern in 1972: \"Nobody I know voted for Nixon.\" Never mind that Nixon carried forty-nine states. She wasn't kidding. If there is one group that is uniquely unqualified to comment on lib-eral bias, it's the big-time media stars. So Dan and Tom and P eter: Stop telling us that we're the problem and start thinking about what lib eral bias really means. APPENDIX B THE RESPONSE My original all Street Journal editorial on media b ias provoked a flood of sympathetic mail. Some of it came from friends in the news profession (such as my CBS colleague Andy Rooney) with whom the sentime nts I expressed struck a chord; most came from a viewership exasperated with increasingly blatant bias on the part of the networks. Here are but a few examp les. 13 Feb 1996 Bernie:  , In the future, if you have any derogatory remarks to make about CBS News or one of your co-workers....I hope you'll do the same thing again.

It may be the first wholly honest bit of public intros pection from CBS News since Murrow considered the nature of those wires in a bo x. If I may presume to say so, CBS News should be prou d.

I HOPE THEY AREN'T AS BAD AS THE ARTICLE SUGGESTS..BUT I FEAR THEY ARE. NEVERTHELESS, THANKS FOR HAVING THE BALLS TO WRITE THE COLUMN. IT NEEDED SAYING AND YOU DID A GOOD JOB ON THE PIECE. I CAN'T FIGURE PEOPLE WHO CLAIM TO LOVB JOURNALISM BUT WHEN SOMEONE COMES ALONG \\ND POINTS OUT SOMETHING THAT NEEDS ATTENTION, THEY CAN'T HANDLE IT. DON'T LOSE ANY STOMACH LINING OVER THIS. EXCELSIOR, BOLO February 14, 1996 Mr. Bernard Goldberg CBS News 524 West 57th Street New York, New York 10019 Dear Mr. Goldberg: Bravo on \"Networks Need a Reality Check.\" You've sa id what many have thought for a long time. Coming from someone within broadcast n ews, your statement is doubly authentic. As you so eloquently point out. the issu e is not bias per se - most people, journalists included, have biases - but how that bias is revealed by journalists. All too often, the liberal media tend to load the dice in favor of their viewpoint, deriding as kooky or somewhat unwo rthy of serious discussion those positions they disagree with That is why se rious students of broadcast news tend to watch the Lehrer News Hour, where a se rious attempt is made to present all sides of an issue. It is to be hoped that some of your network colleag ues will take your criticism to heart In the meantime. I hope you don't lose you r job! Sincerely yours, H. Alan Keene HERBERT K. RUSSELL February 17, 1996 Bernard Goldberg, I thought all the heroes were dead - until I read y our article in The Wall Street Journal for February 13, 1996, re liberal bi as in the media. Please accept my congratulations and thanks for a job well done. Liberal bias among the television networks has done something that market forces could not have engendered, the revitalization of ra dio. Rush Limbaugh would never have become the success he has if the firm of Rather, Brokaw, and Jennings had done its job. Instead, they failed, as you so a bly point out. But all is not lost for television news outlets. Th ere is a market ready and waiting for any network that chooses to deliver 8 t ruthful and unbiased account of the day's events as the evening news. It will be interesting to see whether any of the networks follow this line of reasoning, or whether they will finish burying themselves in the holes they are digging."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"Best wishes, Herbert K.
