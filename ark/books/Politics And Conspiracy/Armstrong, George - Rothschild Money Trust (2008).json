[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"ROTHSCHILD MONEY TRUST George Armstrong"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"PREFACE Mayer Amschel Rothschild, the founder of the Rothschild fortune, at the time of his death in 1812, created a trust of hi s estate, by will, for the elevation of the Jewish race and the establishment of a Jewish World Empire. The cardinal principles of the trust were secrecy, that the estate should be kept intact as a unit, that the heirs and their heirs should have only a communal interest in it, and that the estate as a whole should be governed by the eldest son of the eld- est son unless a majority of the heirs determined otherwise. The estate has been preserved and managed since his death as a unit in pur- suance of the provisions of his will. There are now several hundred heirs, for the family is a prolific one, but the estate is communal and still under the management of one head. So far as known, the provisions of the wills of the members of the family still contain in substance the directions of the founder of the fortune. History affords but meager information regarding the rulers of this fortune and the extent of it, because of their secretive methods. No inventory has ever been filed and no division has ever been sought by any heir. Most of the histories of the Rothschild family are either Jewish or strongly pro-Jewish. While they are extravagant in praise of the virtues of the different members of the Rothschild family, they are rather meager in facts. The facts herein related have been gleaned from many sources and are based on infor- mation believed to be reliable. We do not know the extent of the founder's fortune at the time of his death in 1812, nor do we know the present magnitude of it, but apparently it represents about one-half of the wealth of the world. This huge fortune has been devoted with great shrewdness and energy to the purpose of exploiting the Gentiles in all the countries of the globe. The me- thods employed are the manipulation of currencies, speculations on the ex- changes, and wars. The Rothschilds by these operations profit enormously because they have the power by virtue of their im mense wealth and political power, to put prices up or down at pleasure. It is for these reas ons that we have had most of our wars and depressions. The protocols and the communist’s code, which are identical in purpose and intent, represent their plan for the conquest of the world. Both of these codes were published subsequent to Mayer Amschel's death, but some"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"4 of the protocols appear to have been in existence prior thereto. They, however, represent his principles as shown by all that we know of him. This book is not written in a spirit of anti-Semitism, for I have Jewish friends that I do not wish to injure. It is writte n in the hope that it may be helpful in solving our Jewish problem peaceably and by appropriate legislation. To the extent that the remedies herein suggested may contribute to that end they will be helpful to the Jews as well as to the balance of us, for it is certain that the people of this country will never meekly submit to slavery. In writing and publishing this book I am inspired by no other motive than to render a service to my country. I realiz e that I am taking some risk in doing so—at least that of persecution. Adequate provision has been made for the publication and distribution of this book regardless of the author. September 12, 1940.

THE PROTOCOLS \"For ages past the sons of Israel, despised and persecuted, have been working to open up a path to power. They are hitting the mark. They control the eco- nomic life of the accursed Christians; their influence preponderates over poli- ticians and over manners.\"-—From \"Fun eral Oration of Rabbi Reichhorn.\" Professor Serge Nilus of Russia published the Jewish \"Protocols\" in 1905. They purport to represent the minutes of secret meetings of the leading men of the Jewish race, and to set forth their plans for acquiring the wealth of the peoples of the world, for the overthrow of all governments, and for the creation of the Kingdom of the Jews with a Jewish king. It is stated in the introduction of the booklet that the protocols means \"minut es of the proceedings of the Learned Elders of Zion and that these protocols give the substance of addresses deli- vered to the innermost circles of the rulers of Zion.\" It is also stated that \"the presumption is strong that the protocols were issued or re-issued at the first Zionist Congress held at Basle (Switzerland) in 1897 under the presidency of the father of modern Zionism, the late Theodore Herzl.\" It is also stated that the names of the present elders are a profound secret, that they are the \"Hidden Hand\" that rules the world, and that they probably consist of \"three hundred men, each of whom knows all of the others, govern the fate of the European continent, and they elect their successors from their entourage.\" (Quoting the late Walter Rathnau, a Jew of Germany, as au- thority.) The \"Learned Elders of Zion\" was probab ly a religious order in the beginning, as indicated by the name. But if such was the original foundation of the order, its character, and likewise its name, has since been changed. It is now purely a political racial organization and its present name is the \"Council of the Jewish Agency.\" It is likely that the name was changed on account of the exposure by Nilus. This order must be distinguished from \"Elders of the Synagogue\" and \"Elders of Israel,\" which are purely religious organizations. It must also be distinguished from the \"Zionist Congress\" and \"Zionist General Council.\" These two latter organizations are semi-religious and semi-political and they are also semi-secret and semi-public. They are composed wholly of members of the Zionist church, but not all Jews by any means are church-men."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"10 It is also to be distinguished from th e ancient Jewish Symarium or San Hedrin which was the supreme judicial and administrative authority during the reign of the Roman Herod, when Christ was crucified. It was composed of their \"Chief Priests, rulers, scribes, and Elde rs.\" and was at that time the supreme judicial and political Jewish authority. A recent convention of the \"Zionist Cong ress\" was held in Zu rich, Switzerland, for the purpose of considering the partition of Palestine, which was attended by 480 delegates, from all countries. It appears from the proceedings of this convention that Professor Chaim Weinzmann, formerly of Russia but now of England, was re-elected as president of this international congress; that Rabbi Wise of New York is president of the American branch; that an executive committee of eleven was appointed with full authority to act; that the \"Zionist General Council\" was increased from 54 to 70, the additional members being appointed by the convention. It appears also from the proceedings of th is convention that it defined the poli- cy of the Zionist Church toward the part ition of Palestine, subject to the ap- proval of the \"Council of the Jewish Agency\" the final authority—the present \"Learned Elders of Zion,\" the secret three hundred, the \"Hidden Hand.\" It appears also that the Royal Commission of the British Government made its report regarding the partitio n of Palestine to Lord Rothschild as a member of the \"Council of the Jewish Agency\" and not to Professor Weinzmann as the head of the \"Zionist Congress.\" It appears also that the reason therefore is the fact that the \"Council of the Jewish Agency\" is the authorized agency of the Jewish race—sectarian and non-sectarian. Thus the supreme authority of this \"Jewish Agency\" is officially recognized by both the British Government and the Zionist Congress, although the latter is composed of regularly elected delegates from all countries of the world. What is it? Who are its present members? By wh at authority does it act? What are its purposes? And why all of this secrecy, if its purposes are honest and legiti- mate? We cannot know much about this order because of its secret character and its secret methods. We know that Lord Ro thschild was until his recent death a member of it, and that Lord Melchett of England is now said to be its chair- man. We may assume that the Rothschild family has dominated it since the time of Amschel Rothschild. It is the government of the financial power of the Jewish race that rules the world, including America. It is the cabal of the leading Jewish bankers and politicians who were formerly called the \"Elders of Zion\" and now th e \"Council of the Jewish Agency.\""},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"11 Whatever may have been the original ch aracter and purposes of the \"Learned Elders of Zion\" there can be no doubt about the fact that there was such an organization, that it now exists in some form, and that it is seeking to carry out the program set out in the protocols and according to the plan of the protocols. There is no other explanation of the secret \"Council of the Jewish Agency\" and its achievements. There is no other explanation of the Versailles peace treaty, the League of Nations, the Bank of International Settlements, the Internation- al Labor Board, the deliberate impoverishment of the people of the world by the manipulations of the Elders, and for the present wars and past wars. This is all a definite program with a defini te purpose, and that program and pur- pose are truly set out with brutal frankness in the protocols."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"II. THE PROTOCOLS ARE AUTHENTIC \" 'Per me reges requant.' 'It is through me that kings reign.' And it was said by the prophets that we were chosen by God himself to rule over the whole earth. God has endowed us with genius that we may he equal to our task.\"—From Protocol 5. The Jews, of course, deny the authenticity of the Protocols. It is natural that they should do so. To admit it would be to defeat the purposes of their scheme. Moreover, the plan itself calls for such secrecy and duplicity. The program is so cruel, so inhuman, so diabolical, and the objects to be ac- complished appear so fantastic and remote that it is difficult to believe that this program still obtains. It should, however, be remembered that since the publications of the protocols a great and powerful nation, Russia, has been conquered by a handful of Jews; that Kuhn, Loeb & Co., Paul Warburg, and other Jews, financed the coup de etat by which the Jews secured control of the Russian government; and that the cruel and inhuman methods set out in the protocols were followed mercilessly in Russia by its Jewish government. It should be also remembered that the Je wish Second and Third Internationals of Russia are now actively organizing the forces of communism in every coun- try of the world, including our own. There are more Jews in America today than there were in Russia when the government was overthrown, and they are much more powerful and aggres- sive. It is estimated that there are now 80 times more communists in America than there were in Russia at that time. The same methods that were employed for the overthrow of the Czarist regime are being pursued here, viz: political corruption and class hatred. As cruel and inhuman and incredible as ar e the protocols, they are no more so than the Talmud, whose authenticity the Jews admit. In fact the spirit and philosophy of the protocols permeate the Talmud, and vice versa. They are both founded upon the false premise that the Jews are a superior people and that they are the \"chosen\" people. They both breathe the same hatred and con- tempt for the Christian Gentile whom they call the 'goyim.' They both not only justify but advocate the exploitation and enslavement of the despised 'goyim.' The Talmud is the law and gospel of the Jews. It is their bible and civil law as defined and interpreted by their chief priests and Rabbis."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"16 and the spirit of them still prevai   \"It must be admitted by every critical student of history that the Talmud has not merely been the means of keeping alive the reli- gious idea among the Jews, but ha s formed their strongest bond of union.\" 1 It is not the Talmud but the rabbi that has kept alive the racial and religious solidarity and bigotry and intolerance of the Jews. The following brief quotations from \"The Talmud Unmasked\" 2 are examples of it: \"The life of a Goi and all his powers belong to a Jew.\" (A. Rohl. Die Polem. p. 20).\" (P. 71). \"In Choschen Ham. (266.1) it sa ys: 'A Jew may keep anything he finds which belongs to the Akum, for it is written: Return to thy brethren what is lost (Deuter. XXII, 3) . For he who returns lost property (to Christians) sins against the Law by increasing the power of the transgressors of the Law.\"' (P. 72). \"In Midrasch Talpioth (fol. 225d) it says: 'God created them in the form of men for the glory of Isra el. But Akum were created for the sole end of ministering unto them (the Jews) day and night. Nor can they ever be relieved of this service. It is becoming to the son of a king (an Israelite) that animals in their natural form, and an- imals in the form of human beings should minister unto him'.\" (P. 50). \"And in Eben Haezer (44, 8) : 'I f a Jew enters into marriage with an Akum (Christian), or with his servant, the marriage is null. For they are not capable of entering into matrimony. Likewise if an Akum or a servant enter into matrimony with a Jew, the mar- riage is null'.\" (P. 51). Many of these dicta are ancient but have never been repudiated or repealed ls. They still constitute the law for the Jews, 1 Encyclopedia Britannica, Vol. 23, p. 38. 2 \"The Talmud Unmasked\" by Rev. I. B. Prainatis, Copyrighted by Col. E. N. Sanctuary, 156 Fifth Avenue, New York, N. Y."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"17   both civil and ecclesiastical. The Talmud is made up of the decisions and in- terpretations of the rabbis, in the same manner that our common law has been formed by our judges and commentators. No matter how ancient the dictum, it is the law until overruled by a contrary one. The Jewish Encyclopedia, Vol 4, p. 29 4-296, defines the rabbis' functions as follows: \"Rabbi (my master); function to teach the scriptures and the oral and traditional laws . . . In the Jewish religion the rabbi is no priest, no apostle, he has no hierarchical authority. He is a teach- er, one who unfolds and explains religion, teaches the young in the school, the old from the pulpit, and both by his writings.\" The reader should observe the intermingling of their civil and religious laws. Both appear to be based on their interpretation of the Old Testament (see ref- erence to Deuter. XXII, 3 above). They are so confused that it is impossible to determine where their religion ends and their civil law begins. It is clear, however, that both in a ci vil and religious sense they regard them- selves as a \"chosen\" people, a superior race who are entitled to rule us (the 'goyim'), and are entitled to our services and to everything we have. We Gen- tiles were created for the purpose of serving them, of being their slaves. Al- though in the form of \"human beings\" we are no better than animals. We are not worthy of marrying one of them, either man or woman, and if we do, such marriage is illegal and void. They have adhered to this law rather religiously throughout the ages and in all countries. The author sums up their estimate of us (the goyim) as follows: \"They are idolaters, the worst kind of people, much worse than the Turks, murderers, fornicators, impure animals, like dirt, unwor- thy to be called men, beasts in human form, worthy of the name of beasts, cows, asses, pigs, dogs, worse than dogs; that they propa- gate after the manner of beasts, that they have a diabolic origin, that their souls come from the devil and return to the devil in hell after death; and that even the body of a dead Christian is nothing different from that of an animal.\" 3 3 The Talmud Unmasked. P. 46."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"18   The following are samples of their estimate of Christians and of our Savior, Jesus Christ: \"In Hilkhoth Akum\" (X, 1) it says: 'Do not eat with idolaters, nor permit them to worship their idols; for it is written: Make no co- venant with them, nor show mercy un to them (Deuter. ch. 7) ; 2) . Either turn them away from their idols or kill them.' \"Ibidem (X, 7) : 'In places where Jews are strong, no idolater must be allowed to remain'.\" 4 \"The book Zohar, III (282) tells us that Jesus died like a beast and was buried in that 'dirt heap . . . where they throw the dead bodies of dogs and asses, and where the sons of Esau (the Christians) and of Ishmael (the Turks), also Je sus and Mohammad, uncircumcised and unclean like dead dogs, are buried.\" 5 The author sums up their verdict as follows: \"The Talmud teaches that Jesus Ch rist was illegitimate arid was conceived during menstruation; that he had the soul of Esau; that he was a fool, a conjurer, a seducer; that he was crucified, buried in hell and set up as an idol ever since by his followers.\" (P. 30). They call this a religion and they insist on their privilege to worship God as they choose, and they decry our intolerance and bigotry. The Christian religion is based upon love and charity and repentance and the forgiveness of sin. There is no charity, no love, and no repentance here; there is nothing but pride, intolerance, and hatred. The Christian religion is everything the Talmud is not, and the Talmud is eve- rything the Christian religion is not; it and its devotees are the anti-Christ. We have the spectacle now of a Jewish rabbi, a Catholic priest and a Protestant preacher going about over the country at Jewish expense preaching tolerance; a virtue that is utterly foreign to the Jewish religion and the Jewish character. 4 P. 98. 5 P. 48."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"19 The chief priests and rabbis who wrote the various and numerous dissertations set forth in the Talmud could have written the protocols. They are of kindred nature and expression; they are made of the same cloth and patterned in the same fashion. We prefer to think that the Talmud and the protocols misrepresent the view- point of the Jews that we know and with whom we come in daily contact, and that may be true of many of them. Ho wever that may be, we know that the Jews hold themselves as a race apart an d that they adhere religiously to their ancient racial customs and rituals and or ganizations. We know also that they blindly \"follow the leader,\" and that th eir rabbis and Learned Elders are their leaders. They believe in their Talmud and obey its edicts—indeed they must do so or suffer racial ostracism; and they worship the Rothschilds and the Roth- schild power that rules them. These and similar proclamations as set forth in the Talmud, constitute the \"bond\" that has held the race together. They explain the fact that the Jew does not assimilate with other races. They are based on the false assumption that the Jews are a \"chosen\" and superior people. The Talmud is mistaken. The Jews are not a \"chosen\" or a superior people. God never made any such mistake as that. The history of the race is not one of achievement of anything except money. It is one of chiseling and of defrauding the peoples of the various countries in which they have resided, which has often been followed by their own alleged persecution. In this life we usually reap what we sow, or in common parlance, \"get what is coming to us.\" The history of Judaism is proof of the truth of this proverb. It may be conceded that the Jew is more shrewd and cunning, and a better trader and manipulator of money than the Gentile—but that represent the limit of his superiority and achievements. The Jew has contributed but little to science, invention, art, to the wealth of nations, or to the advancement of civi- lization. I hope that I am not intolerant and anti-Semitic, but I confess that I have no patience with a religion that denounces Christ as a bastard, an imposter and a cheat, and that glory in his crucifixion; and I am against a race that holds me as an inferior being and seeks to enslav e me. I nevertheless wish to be fair and just, as well as candid and plain-spoken, in my discussion of the subject. I can make allowance for the fact that the Jews feel, and probably righteously so, an ancient grievance against the Gentiles because of past oppressions, which is kept alive by their rabbis and Learned Elders and their protocols and"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"20 Talmud. But it is high time for them to get over it, to forget their vengeance and to abandon their ambitious designs, particularly here in America where we do not want to harm them, and wish to accord them all of the rights and privileges we enjoy. The renegade Gentiles who cooperate with them in furthering their villainous scheme, viz., to enslave the peoples of the world, are no better than the Jews. They are in fact worse, for they are without the excuse of race or religion. They are simply unmitigated scoundrels. They will herein be desi gnated for descrip- tive purposes as Jewish. This term will be used also in describing hybrids and those suspected of Jewish blood."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"III. THE JEWS DEFENSE \"For what purpose then have we invented this whole policy and insinuated it into the minds of the goys without giving them any chance to examine its underlying meaning? For what, indeed, if not in order to obtain in a roundabout way what is for our scat- tered tribe unattainable by the di rect road? It is this which has served as the basis for our organi zation of secret masonry which is not known to, and aims which are not even so much as sus- pected by these goy cattle, attracte d by us into the \"show\" army of Masonic lodges in order to throw dust in the eyes of their fel- lows.\"—From Protocol 11. The Liberty Magazine (Feb. 10 and 17, 1940) published two articles under the heading \"The Jews and Free Masonry — Exploding the Myth of a World Con- spiracy,\" written by Louis B. Davidson and Frederic L. Collins. These articles represent the flimsy and threadbare defense of the Jews that has been pub- lished from time to time in various forms. They purport to contain a synopsis of the testimony given in the trial at Berne, Switzerland, where the trial court found the defendant booksellers guilty and declared the protocols to be \"for- gery, plagiarism, and obscene literature.\" There is some historical truth in this story, mixed as it is with much that is false, but the conclusions based upon this admixture are wholly false. It is true as they assert, that \"there is no inte rnational organization of Free-masonry, and the organization of each nation is independent of all others.\" The conti- nental masonry is composed wholly of Jews and hybrids. While the Jews are permitted to be masons in America (Catholics are excluded), they do not do- minate the order and it is not a racial one and is not communistic. It is a non- political fraternal benevolent organiza tion, while continental masonry is a political, malevolent one. No one claims, except the authors of these articles, that \"the noble order of Freemasons should be drawn into this campaign or calumny,\" or \"links free masonry with world Jewry in a mythical conspiracy to rule the world.\" It is admitted, as these authors allege, that the \"Illuminati\" founded by the Jew Adam Weishaupt was a branch of the co ntinental masons and that \"the chief aim of this organization . . . was the destruction of all forms of religion, gov- ernment, property, marriage, and all civil rights,\" which is likewise the present chief aim of the \"Learned Elders of Zion ,\" and of the Jewish communist party."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"24 It is also admitted, as they allege, that the Illuminati \"played a major role in bringing on the bloody days of 1789 (F rench Revolution), that it was founded and reputedly financed by Jews,\" and that the \"great House of Rothschild was then just rising to the financial heights.\" There is evidence that it was in fact financed by the \"great House of Rothschild;\" and the French revolution was in fact brought about by the Jews. It was the final act that freed the Jews from their political and civil disabilities in France. It is also true, as they allege, that the \"Kerensky government in 1917 confis- cated the entire issue (of the protocols) except one volume which had been sent to the British museum. It is said that the Jew Kerensky not only destroyed all of the copies to be found in Russia but that every Gentile found in posses- sion of one was murdered. What stronger proof of guilt could there be? Men do not fear lies and forgeries; it is the truth that the guilty always want to sup- press. The copy that was sent to the British Museum was translated by Victor Mars- den, a representative of the London Morning Post, who had previously resided in Russia for many years. It is true, as they allege, that the protocols have been translated into French, Italian, Arab ic, German, Japanese and Scandinavian languages. It is said that their circulation is second only to that of the bible. I have no means of knowing whether the protocols are responsible for the po- groms in Russia, as detailed in the articles mentioned. They have undoubtedly created a profound impression throughout the world, which is evidence that people believe them despite the Jewish control of the press, and their ridicule and their denials. \"Are they authentic? Shouted the alarmed editor of the (Jewish owned) Lon- don Times in May 1920,\" according to these authors. \"What malevolent society made these schemes and is now triumphing over their realization? Are they forged? From where does the weird gift of prophecy spring that partly has come true and is partly to be realized? . . . Have we escaped a German peace by straining all our national resources only to submit to a Jewish peace?\" (This is precisely what happened). The above quotation is from the Liberty article. They do not tell us what the Jewish owners did to this \"alarmed editor.\" They probably crucified him. It is not true that Nilus was a \"briefless av ocat\" in Russia and it is not true that he wrote the protocols to \"find favor with the Grand Duchess Elizabeth.\" Even the authors of the Liberty articles do not vouch for this fantastic story. Why then mention it? On the contrary, Nilus was a reputable educator and author of unimpeachable integrity. He believed that the \"Hidden Hand\" was the au-"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"25 thor of the protocols, and such was also the belief of Victor Marsden the trans- lator, and such is also the belief of millions of people in all countries. Assuming that the authors have correctly quoted the various paragraphs from \"Maurice Joly's Dialogues in Hell,\" it must be admitted that there is evident plagiarism by the real author of the protocols. But that does not prove that Nilus was the plagiarist. If the \"dialogues in hell\" truly represented the hellish plans of the Elders it is but natural that they should adopt them and use them. In that case they are the plagiarists. The weakest part of the whole argument is the statement of the evidence upon which the Berne trial court predicated it s judgment. It is in substance as fol- lows: The Princess Catherine Radziwill testified that she knew \"the Paris agent of the Russian secret police and that she knew Golovinsky, very well;\" that Golovinsky had access to Joly's Dialogues, that he \"came to her home with parts of the script which he showed and read to her; . . . that his job was to prove to the Czar that the Jews had formed an international plot to conquer the world.\" She was asked, \"Could you describe Golovinsky's draft?\" She replied, \"Yes, as he kept reading passages to me I became familiar with the entire script. He later showed me the completed manuscript. It was identical with the Protocols of Zion, which I later saw in the various Nilus editions. It was written in French in a variety of handwritings. It was on yellowish paper; there was a big circular blue ink blot on the first page.\" \"This description was confirmed by the Count du Chayla, who described the text as unidiomatic and showing every si gn of having been written by a fo- reigner on cheap yellowish paper —and said that on the first page was a circu- lar ink blot.\" It should be remembered that this trial was in 1935, just thirty years after the publication of the protocols in 1905. It must be conceded that these two wit- nesses who were able to remember the contents of a lengthy document that did not concern them, and an ink spot thereon, for such a long period of time, had most remarkable memories. It is ob viously manufactured testimony, but if all they said were true it does not prove that Nilus forged the protocols or that they are spurious. The decision of the Bern trial court was reversed by the appellate court, which the said Liberty authors failed to mentio n. This reversal is not surprising in view of the utter lack of competent and credible evidence. It should be also remembered that the Jews selected their own court in which to file their suit."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"26 It is a cinch that they selected a Jewish or pro-Jewish one. They wanted to be able to proclaim to the world, as they do, that the courts have adjudged that the protocols are spurious. In passing judgment on the Jews and th eir denials, it should always be re- membered that the Talmud enjoins them to deceive the Christians, to lie to them and to cheat them. It is their law and their religion, and it is the part of it that many of them observe industriousl y and enthusiastically. We \"goyim\" are as dumb and gullible as they believe us to be if we accept such flimsy explana- tions at par. The succeeding chapters of this book will prove conclusively that the \"Learned Elders of Zion\"—the present Council of the Jewish Agency are now ceaselessly and relentlessly pursuing their ancient plan to enslave the people of the world and to establish their world empire. There can be no proof of such a secret conspiracy other than by its fruits. There can be no explanation of current events or of the worlds history for the past 150 years except the machinations of the financial power that has govern ed it during that period of time. It will be hereafter proven with reasonable certainty that the protocols contain the law of the Rothschild money power that now rules every country of the world, including our own. The protocols are the \"law of our bank\" to which Rabbi Reichhorn referred in his funeral oration (see Appendix II). They are the law of the Bank of England, the Bank of France, the New York Federal Reserve Bank, the Washington Federal Reserve Bo ard, J. P. Morgan & Co., and Kuhn, Loeb & Co., and of N. M. Rothschild & Sons and of Georges Mandel (Jeroboam Rothschild). They are the key that explains the political maneuverings of this malign power. When it is once clearly understood that these immense financial institutions are all controlled by the \"King-Despot of the blood of Zion\" who is none other than the present head of the Rothschild family, we can better understand the turmoil of the world and our own distressed condition. It should be observed that the protocol quoted at the beginning of this chapter states that there are two kinds of masonry, viz: \"secret masonry\" and \"show masonry;\" that the \"aims\" of the secret masonry are known only to themselves and that they are not even suspected by the \"goy cattle\" who compose the \"show masonry.\" The secret masonry in France was the \"Illuminati,\" and in Russia and the bal- ance of Europe, the Nihilists, and in America the B'nai B'rith. It should be also observed that the protocols make the distinction between the ignorant \"goy"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"27 cattle\" who are members of the \"show\" lodges, and their own wise sect who belong to their secret orders. The Illumi nati and Nihilists were destroyers and killers.

MAYER AMSCHEL ROTHSCHILD , FIRST KING OF THE JEWS \"The King of the Jews will be the real Pope of the Universe, the pa- triarch of an international church.\" —From Protocol 17. MAYER AMSCHEL ROTHSCHILD, 1—1790-1812. Mayer Amschel was born in 1743 and died Sept. 29, 1812. He married Gutter Schnaper in 1770. They had a large family consisting of five sons and five daughters. He was educated as a rabbi an d in his early life was both a rabbi and a junk and coin dealer. He became a money lender and in that connection acted as agent for William IX, Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel. There is much obscurity in the history of the Rothschild family, due to the fact that their operations are always secret and the historians are either Semitic or anti-Semitic, the majority being Semitic. The conclusions here presented are based principally on Jewish or pro-Jewish history. I shall quote liberally from the Jewish Encyclopedia because it was, as stated in its preface, \"prepared by more than 400 scholars and specialists\" all of whom were Jews. 6 It was pub- lished in 1905 and re-published in 1909. Wh ile it is a partisan history, it is on the whole, accurate in its statements of fact—it at least presents the Jew ver- sion of the facts. The authority mentioned says: \"In a latter connection (money lender) he became an agent of Wil- liam IX, Landgrave cf Hesse-Cassel, who on his father's death in 1785 had inherited the largest private fortune in Europe (esti- mated at $40,000,000) derived mainly from the hire of troops to the British government for the putting down of the revolution in the United States . . . After the battle of June in 1806 the Landgrave fled to Denmark, leaving 600,000 pounds (about $3,000,000) with Mayer Rothsc hild for safe keeping.\"   6 *Jewish Ency. Vol. X, p. 499 et seq."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"32 It states further: \"According to legend this money was hidden away in wine casks and escaping the search of Napole on's soldiers when they entered Frankfort, was restored intact in the same casks in 1814 when the elector returned to the electorate. The facts are somewhat less ro- mantic and more business-like.\" The facts are entirely \"less romantic an d more businesslike,\" (from the Jewish standpoint). Mayer Amschel Rothschild embezzled the money. This money was tainted from its very origin. It was paid by the British government to the Landgrave for the services of his soldiers, used to suppress the American revo- lution, and the soldiers were morally entitled to it. It was first embezzled by William of Hesse and then by Mayer Amschel. This twice-stolen money is the foundation of the huge Rothschild fortune. It has ever since been true to its origin. There is not an honestly acquired dollar in the hundreds of billions now possessed by the Rothschild family. Instead of putting the money in wine ca sks, Mayer Rothschild sent the entire sum, with his son Nathan, to London, an d then and there established the Lon- don branch of the family. \"Nathan . . . invested it in 800,000,000 pounds of gold from the East India Company, knowing that it would be needed for Wel- lington's peninsula campaign. He made no less than four profits: (1) on the sale of Wellington's paper (which he bought at 50c on the dollar and collected at par); (2) on the sale of gold to Welling- ton; (3) on its re-purchase; and (4) on forwarding it to Portugal. This was the beginning of the great fortune.\" (p. 494). This was indeed much \"less romantic and more businesslike.\" With this vast sum of money, branches of the House of Rothschild were established in Berlin, Paris, Vienna and Naples, with one of the brothers in charge of each of them. AH of these houses were exceedingly prosperous, particularly the London and Paris branches. The founder of this huge fortune, Mayer Amschel Rothschild, established four fundamental principles for its governme nt, which the sons and their descen- dents have observed, viz:"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"33 suffer the penalties for so d   (1) The eldest son of the eldest son to be the head and ruler of the fortune. He became the head by virtue of his seniority unless the majority of the members of the family decided otherwise. There have been only two exceptions to this rule so far as revealed by history, and that was the appointment of Nathan, the third son of Mayer Amschel, as its he ad, and later the appointment of James the fifth son. By reason of his achievements Nathan was appointed the head of the fortune upon Mayer Amschel's death in 1812. (2) The inter-marriage of cousins. This was for the purpose of preserving the family fortune intact and in the family . This rule has not been strictly ob- served, particularly by the female memb ers of the family, due no doubt partial- ly to rebellion on the part of some members of the family and partially to the fact that other Jews have become very rich and by reason of marriage the fami- ly fortune has been enhanced rather than depleted. \"The number of marriages between cousins in the late history of the family is remarkable . . . Of 58 marriages, 29, or exactly one- half, have been between first cousin s. It is noteworthy that these marriages have been fertile and that most of the children have been girls, which is what is anticipated by biological science.\" (3) The unity of the family fortune and its concealment. No copy of Mayer Amschel's will has been published by any of the historians of the family. All that we are permitted to know about it is what the historians say of it, by the record of the family and by the reference to it in the will of one of his grand- sons, Anselm, of Vienna. It contains the following provision: \"In accordance with the exhortations of my father, the grandfa- ther who so sincerely loved them (Anselm's children), as contained in Clause 15 of his will, may th ey and their descendants remain constantly true to their ancestral Jewish faith. \"I forbid them most explicitly, in any circumstances whatever, to have any public inventory made by the courts, or otherwise, of my estate . . . Also I forbid any lega l action, and any publication of the value of the inheritance . . . Anyone who disregards these provi- sions and takes any kind of action which conflicts with them shall immediately be regarded as having disputed the will, and shall oing.\" 7 7 The Reign of the House of Rothschild, p. 405."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"34 (4) A perpetual family partnership. At the time of Mayer Amschel's death, his entire estate was in the form of a partnership composed of himself and his five sons, each having an equal interest, under the firm name of M. A. Rothschild & Sons. Both the partnership agreement and Mayer Amschel's will provided that the partners and their male descendants should forever constitute the firm and manage it. The will provided also that the female members of the family and their heirs and husbands should have no part in the management of the firm and that they should receive their interest in the estate subject to the manage- ment of the male members; and that if any of them should contest this ar- rangement that they would lose their interest in the estate. Later, Nathan organized the London firm of N. M. Rothschild & Sons on the same plan. This firm was probably owne d in equal proportions by him and his brothers and governed in the same manner as the parent partnership. Originally the partnership agreement pr ovided that no important decision should be made without the approval of all the partners. As the fortune grew in magnitude it became impractical to hold partners conferences upon its nu- merous undertakings. It is probable that Nathan's firm was organized in part to meet that situation and for the purpose of separating the activities of the London house from those of the continental houses. It was probably Mayer Amschel's purpose in the beginning to establish a Jew- ish dynasty with his male descendants as rulers. Whether that was his purpose or not, it was the effect of his will. He established the kingdom of the Jews that has since been governed by his male descendants. Wherever a Jew is located, whatever nationality he may claim, he is a subject of this kingdom; his alle- giance and duty to it supersedes his allegiance and duty to the country in which he dwells. If a conflict develops between the government of his adopted country and his racial government, the Jew will always be found on the side of his race. He may not know the personnel of his racial government, its decisions may be unwritten, but they will reach him in some form, through his rabbis and through secret societies, and he is always obedient to them. That fact furnishes the explanation of all this Jewish war propaganda which is supported blindly and without dissent by all Jews. At the time of Mayer Amschel's death he was by far the richest man in the world or that had ever lived. The magnitude of his fortune at that time is un- known. It was growing by leaps and bounds at such a rapid rate that it proba- bly could not be estimated. He knew the power of money and the wisdom of"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"35 secrecy. He believed with religious fe rvor that the Jews were the \"chosen people\" and that God had promised them that they should rule the world. We cannot know whether at that time he had in contemplation a Jewish world empire. Apparently this was a later development. There is good reason to be- lieve that this ambitious enterprise was initiated by Theodore Herzl a short time before the publication of the protoc ols in 1905. Herzl was an active, ambi- tious Jewish rabbi-politician and an intense hater of the Gentiles. He was giv- en credit for organizing modern Zionism at a conference of the leaders of the Hebrew race in Basle, Switze rland, in 1897. It is thought that at that time and at that meeting some of the protocols were adopted as precepts for the estab- lishment of the contemplated Jewish empire. Herzl probably organized two important Jewish organizations: (1) a secret super-organization to be composed of 300 men whose identity should be kept secret and who would constitute the supe r-government for the Jewish race; (2) a popular religious organization to be composed of 450 delegates selected by the rabbis and the Hebrew churches. At that time the Rothschild estate ha d grown to enormous proportions but the family had grown soft with luxury and had deteriorated by inbreeding. Moreo- ver the fortune at that time had already effected the emancipation of the Jews and established the Rothschild kingdom. Apparently it then had the power under efficient management to establish a Jewish empire. Apparently also the management of the vast political power of the estate needed to be reinforced with outside blood. It is likely that at that time and through Herzl's activities, the Secret Committee of 300 was established for the management of the politi- cal power of the huge estate with the consent of the Rothschilds. It is known that Theodore Herzl was an intimate pe rsonal friend of Lord Rothschild, II. The protocols themselves, or the gist of them, appear to have existed for a long period of time prior to their publication in 1905. In fact the intent and purpose of them are in substance contained in the Talmud. They were also in substance stated in 1869 in the Funeral Oration of Rabbi Reichhorn (set out in Appendix II). They evince a clear conception of the weakness of Gentile governments and institutions, and the best method to attack and destroy them. They set out the most effective method of establishing a dictatorship of the proletariat, which is the first step toward World Empire. The protocols themselves describe in great detail the powers of the King- Despot of their proposed empire, and the objectives of such empire.

THE ROTHSCHILD DYNASTY \"Our power in the present tottering condition of all forms of pow- er will be more invincible than any other, because it will remain invisible until the moment when it has gained such strength that no cunning can any longer unde rmine it.\"— From Protocol I. King Amschel Rothschild I, was succeed ed upon his death by his third son, Nathan, of London, on account of his uncanny and unscrupulous financial ability, and because of his achievements . He had, prior to Amschel's death, established the private banking house of N. M. Rothschild & Sons, and added enormously to the family fortune. It appears that the elder brother, Mayer Amschel, jr., who continued in charge of the Frankfort branch, recognized the superior qualifications of Nathan and was willing to waive his right by virtue of primo geniture. Nathan was therefore chos en by the four brothers as his fa- ther's successor. KING NATHAN ROTHSCHILD II.—1812-1836. Nathan married the sister-in-law of Moses Montefiore, \"thus coming into as- sociation with the heads of the Sephardic community then ruling the financial world of London through their connection with Amsterdam.\" 8 Nathan is de- scribed by the historian John Reeves, a Rothschild partisan, as being a very shrewd, unscrupulous and uncouth man, and exceedingly close-fisted. He says that \"he never paid his employees a fart hing more than was necessary for their bare subsistence or at least not a farthing more than they could compel him to pay.\" 9 The Jew, Benjamin Disraeli, in his novel \"Coningsby,\" denominates Nathan and also his son Lionel as \"Sidonia.\" He says of the elder \"Sidonia\": \"He arrived here (London) after th e peace of Paris with his large capital. He staked all that he was worth on the Waterloo loan and the event made him one of the greatest capitalists in Europe . . . of hi s sagacity. Europe did require He reaped the due reward   8 Jewish Ency., Vol. X, p. 494. 9 \"The Rothschilds,—Financial Rulers of Nations.\""},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"40 money and Sidonia was ready to lend it to Europe. France wanted some, Austria more, Prussia a little, Russia a few millions; Sido- nia could furnish them all. The only country which he avoided was Spain; he was too well acquainted with its resources.\" Disraeli says of him further: \"He established a brother or a near relative in whom he could confide, in most of the principal capitals. He was lord and master of the money markets of the worl d and of course virtually lord and master of everything else. He literally held the revenues of southern Italy in pawn , and monarchs and ministers of all coun- tries courted his advice and were guided by his suggestions.\" John Reeves, in his book \"The Rothschilds,\" says: \"One cause of his (Nathan's) success was the secrecy with which he shrouded, and the tortuous policy with which he misled those who watched him the keenest.\" (P. 189). And this principle, it may be added, has governed the management of the Rothschild fortune from its beginning to this hour. The historian Reeves describes vividly how upon Nathan's return from near the battle of Waterloo (the Jews are usually observers of battles, not partici- pants), he went post haste to the English Channel and there hired a boat at excessive cost and crossed the English channel in stormy weather, and from there rushed to the London stock exchange, appearing muddy and dejected, where he passed out the word that Wellington had been defeated at Waterloo, and reinforced this by ostentatiously dumping stocks on the market. This created a great panic upon the exchange and everybody dumped their stocks at sacrifice prices. In the meantime Nathan, through his agents, was secretly buying them. There were no telegraphs or telephones or radios or fast posts in those days. It was several days before the news reache d London that Wellington had won the battle of Waterloo. There was then great rejoicing and the stock market re- bounded and stocks went to unpreceden ted heights, when Nathan unloaded his stocks. This is precisely the method that the Rothschilds have followed since, and is one of the methods by which they have amassed their huge fortune. \"Nathan"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"41   boasted that he had multiplied their capital 2500 times in the course of five years.\" 10 If this is true, it means that at that time (about 1820) the capital of the English branch had been increased from $3 ,000,000 to about $7,500,000,000. Nathan established the private banking firm of N. M. Rothschild & Sons in London, with branches in Paris, Berlin, Vienna and Naples. This firm operates on the exchanges, underwrites government and other loans; it is the agent and manager of banks, railways, steel, munitions, and other corporations. It has branches under many names. In Americ a it is represented by Kuhn, Loeb & Co., and formerly by August Belmont & Co. It is probable also that J. P. Mor- gan & Co., Seligman & Co., Speyer & Co., Lehman & Co., and other private Jewish banks are its under-cover branches. Lionel Rothschild, the eldest son of Nathan, succeeded him as the head and managing partner of N. M. Rothschild & Sons. He is described by his fellow tribesman, Disraeli, as follows: \"He perceived himself a lone being, alike without cares and with- out duties; his religion walled him out from the pursuits of a citi- zen . . . He was a man without affections . . . The only human qual- ity that interested 'Sidonia' was in tellect . . . No minister of state had such communication with secret agents and political spies as Sidonia; he held relations with a ll the clever outcasts of the world. The catalogue of his acquaintance in the shape of Greeks, Arme- nians, Moors, secret Jews, Tartars, gypsies, wandering Poles and Carbonari, would throw a curious light on those subterranean agencies of which the world in general knows so little, but which exercise so great an influence on public events.\" 11 10 \"The Rothschilds, Financial Rulers of Nations,\" p. 167. 11 \"Coningsby,\" by Benjamin Disraeli, p. 180-181."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"42   The Jewish Encyclopedia states: \"Lionel was the friend and counselor of the Prince Consort and of Disraeli, whose Sidonia in \"Coningsby\" is an ideal portrait of him . . . that he brought about in 1858 the enactment of the disabilities bill which permitted the Jews to hold office in England . . . \"He advanced the British government the money for the Irish fa- mine loan (about $40,000,000) and also for the Crimean war (about $80,000,000), and that for tw enty years he acted as agent for the Russian government. \"He had a large share in the successful funding of the United States national debt, provided the funds for the immediate pur- chase of the Suez Canal shares; he was also active in facilitating the payment of the French indemnit y to Germany, in directing the finances of the Austrian Empire , and the Egyptian loan of 8,500,000 pounds. (About $40,000,000).\" 12 The statement is in error as to the funding of the United States National debt. This funding operation which was handled by the firm of Morgan & Company and the Rothschilds was the retirement of greenbacks during Cleveland's Ad- ministration. It brought about the hard times of that period. The \"facilitating the payment of the French indemnity to Germany\" was the demonetization of silver in 1873 which has been correctly called \"the crime of '73.\" Lionel was elected a Member of Parliament from Aylesbury but refused to take the oath of office upon a Bible containing the New Testament, and conse- quently was refused his seat. He ran and was elected a second time, with the same result. Upon his third election the oath was waived as to the New Testa- ment and he was sworn in on the Old Testament. He was the first Jew to hold office in England. Thus began the poll ution and deterioration of the British Government. Lionel's eldest son, Nathan Mayer (Lord Rothschild 1st) succeeded him as head of N. M. Rothschild & Sons on his death in 1879.

Queen Vic- toria at first objected on the ground th at \"to make a Jew a peer is a step she could not consent to; it would be ill-taken and would do the government great harm.\" 14 Unfortunately, she yielded against her woman's intuition and her sound judg- ment. This was the beginning of the transformation of the British House of Lords from a Gentile landed aristocrac y to a Jewish plutocracy, and of the government from a Gentile to a Jewish government. It is reported that there are now sixty Jews in the House of Lords without counting the hybrids that should in fact be included. The intermarriage of the impoverished landed aristocrats with rich Jewesses has polluted the bloodstream of the British aristocracy and to that extent wea- kened the government. While the Jews wish to preserve their racial integrity they also seek to have their women marry titles, for such marriages increase their prestige and power. The Jew and the hybrid infest the House of Commons as well as the House of Lords. Many of the members of that body are Jewish owners of large estates elected by the tenants of such estates, as was Lionel. The present decadent British Empire and government (Churchill, Eden, Cooper, et al.) are due pri- marily to the Jew and Jewish blood po llution. It is a Jewish government.

Mayer Amschel Rothschild hated the Gentiles with an intense religious hatred and that hatred has been handed down from generati on to generation. It is hatred that demands ven- geance upon the Gentile race—\"an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.\" It is shown in every paragraph, every sentence and every word in the three codes of the family, viz., the Talmud, the protocols, and the code of the communists. Perhaps in the beginning it was justifie d, for the age in which Mayer Amschel lived was a cruel age and the Jews were undoubtedly despised and oppressed by the various peoples among whom they lived; this was particularly true of the German and Russian peoples and governments. This hatred of the Gentile is still kept alive by the Council of the Jewish Agency, their protocols, and the rabbis and their Talmud. Nathan Mayer Rothschild died in 1915 and was succeeded by his eldest son, Lionel Walter, the second Lord Rothschild, as the head of the banking firm N. M. Rothschild & Sons. He appears to have been a member of the Council of the Jewish Agency. He died in 1937 and was succeeded as head of the London branch of the banking firm by his eldest son, Nathan Mayer Victor (third Lord Rothschild) who is the present gold agent of the Bank of England. The history of the second and third Lord Rothschild is current and not yet recorded. It may be safely assumed that all of the active male members of the Rothschild family are members of the Council of the Jewish Agency, for that is the agency that controls the political policy of the Rothschild fortune. KING ROTHSCHILD, III (Baron James), 1836-1868. Upon Nathan's death in 1836 the scepter and the line of descent passed from Nathan's eldest son Lionel, head of the London house, to James Rothschild, fifth son of Amschel, head of the Paris Ho use. This despite the fact that Lionel was then 28 years old, had married in orthodox fashion his first cousin Carlot- ta, the daughter of his uncle Solomon, was the manager of the richest banking branch of the family, and was the ablest of them all. All of the Jewish histo- rians agree that this change was made but none of them assign any reason. Count Cherep-Spiridovich states the reason as follows: \"James Rothschild, born in 1792, misruled from 1836 until 1868. He married ugly Betty, the daughter of his brother Solomon of Vienna. Because of the \"crime\" of Nathan the latter's son Lionel"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"45 schel's grandsons.\" 16   was deprived of the World's Throne. James became Rothschild III, Thus decided Amschel (Anselm) Salomon, and Karl Rothschild, who all gathered in July 1836 at Frankfort in order to judge and presumably to execute Nathan, possibly the only Rothschild, who through total lack of principle, wi shed to become a Christian, only that he could the easier deceive and enslave the English people.\" 15 All of the Jewish authorities agree that there was a general family reunion and a great banquet in Paris on the occasion of the marriage of Lionel; that Nathan was taken violently ill and seized with spasms indicating poisoning; that the doctors were unable to diagnose the trouble and that he died within a few hours. Whether he was poisoned or not, the kingship of the Rothschild fortune passed from Nathan's heirs to his brother James and his heirs. History reveals but little about the reign of James. He appears to have been a cold, cruel, shrewd, unscrupulous man who contributed materially to the wealth of the Paris House. His personal wealth at the time of his death was estimated at 45,000,000 pounds,—or mo re than $200,000,000,—but this was only an estimate, since no inventory of his estate was filed. KING ROTHSCHILD, IV., (Baron Alphonse D.) 1868 to------- . The most recent history of the Rothschild family is that of the Jewish Cecil Roth, published in 1939. It brings the history of the English branch down to that date, but not that of the Paris br anch. Therefore we can know but little about the reign of this monarch. John Reeves, in his book published in 1887, said: \"The present head of the firm in Paris is Baron Alphonse D. Roth- schild, the eldest son of Baron James. He inherits much of his fa- ther's financial talent and is ackn owledged by the rest of his rela- tives as the shrewdest and most able man of business among them. He is the head of the family not only on account of his abili- ty but on account of his seniority, as he is the oldest of Mayer Am- 15 \"The Secret World Government, or The Hidden Hand,\" p. 138. 16 \"The Rothschilds, Financial Rulers of Nations,\" p. 54."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"KING ROTHSCHILD V or VI (Jeroboam Rothschild, alias Georges Mandel).

There is here presented a picture of him and his puppet Paul Reynaud, Prem- ier of France, reproduced from the May 27, 1940, issue of \"Time Magazine,\" a Jewish publication. His countenance reve als his character. He appears to be a crafty, cruel, greedy, mean man, with no t a single redeeming virtue; He is the product of four generations of treach ery and inbreeding, and a true descen- dant of \"ugly Betty.\" We can now better understand the infamous peace treaty, the Brussels Financial Conference, the de pressions of 1920, 1930 and 1937, the election of Franklin D. Roosevelt, the New Deal, and the present World War. We do not know why he changed his name from Jeroboam Rothschild to Georges Mandel unless it was for the same reason that other Jews change their names, viz: to deceive. But why should he want to deceive unless it is to con- ceal the fact that he is the present ruler of the welfare of all of the people of the world? We can understand why Isidore Isokowitz would change his name to Eddie Cantor. But the name Rothschild is eminently respectable and carries more weight than Mandel. Surely no Rothschild would be ashamed of a name that represents the political and financial power of the world, and that is graced by many honorary titles. The only apparent reason for his hiding behind a ficti- tious name is his inbred secretiveness, which is in keeping with the time- honored Rothschild system. The author of \"The Hidden Hand\" states that Edward Rothschild of Paris, France, was at the date of the publication of his book in 1925, the ruler of the Rothschild fortune. I have not accepted this view for the reasons that Jero- boam Rothschild was at that time and prior and subsequent thereto, an in- fluential member of the French cabinet and that he was Clemenceau's adviser when the Versailles peace treaty was written. This was an occasion of such great importance to the Jewish race that the head of the family would no doubt have officiated."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"VI. THE WEALTH OF THE ROTHSCHILD FAMILY \"Gold always has been and always will be the irresistible power. Handled by expert hands it always will be the most useful lever for those who possess it, and the object of envy for those who do not.\"—From \"Funeral Oration of Rabbi Reichhorn.\" According to the boast of Nathan Rothschild he increased the family fortune from $3,000,000 to about $7,500,000,000 within five years time, which would be in about 1820. In 1848 the Paris house was reckoned at 600,000,000 francs as against 362,000,000 for all of the other Paris bankers. We have no historical information as to the wealth of the Berlin, Vienna and Naples branches. We do, however, know that they were strong enough to do- minate the money markets of those capitals. At the rate of speed that Nathan traveled , viz., an increase of 500% a year, the fortune of the London branch alone would have been more than $100,000,000,000 by 1840. It is not likely, however, that he continued to multiply the family fortune 500% a year, bu t it is probable that he continued to increase it at the rate of 10% or more, annually. At this rate it would have amounted to approximately $20,000,000 ,000 by 1840, just 100 years ago. The imagination can scarcely conceive the immensity and power of such a fortune. The three greatest American fortunes have been the Rockefeller, Car- negie, and Ford, which together would not exceed $2,000,000,000. If those fortunes should be loaned at 5% compou nd interest the mere accumulation of interest would in the course of time, and not a very long time at that, consume the wealth of the world. But compound interest is only a small element of the Rothschild fortune; it has been developed by speculation on the exchanges preceding and following wars and depressions as well as by the accumulation of interest. We can take pencil and paper and figure accurately the increase of $20,000,000,000 at 5% compound interest in 100 years time, but it is im- possible to even approximate the profits from the manipulation of the ex- changes. The Rothschilds, during that en tire period of 100 years, have been active manipulators of every important stock and commodity exchange of the world.

It is by these crooked manipulations that they and the members of their race have acquired the greater part of the wealth of the world. The authority mentioned 17 reports that from 1817 to 1848 they made loans to various countries, aggregating 654,487,200 pounds. It reports also that they financed both Napoleon and the allies during the Napoleonic wars, and that they financed the American wars. \"But in the two great wars Jewish financiers played a considera- ble role owing doubtless to thei r European connections. Hamym Solomon in the revolutionary war, while Seligman Brothers and Speyer & Company financed the North and Messrs. Erlanger the South in the great civil war. More recently, in the great develop- ment of railway finance the firm of Kuhn, Loeb & Company have taken a prominent part.\" It will shock the American people to learn that Hamyn Solomon, whom we have regarded as a revolutionary hero, was the agent of Rothschild, and that Rothschild financed both sides of the American Revolution and the civil war. This is true to form. They acknowledge allegiance to no country; they are out for the money, and it matters not how or where they get it; they wish to de- stroy all governments in order to establ ish their own, and their method is to promote and finance wars. It was stated by the Russian Major General, Count Cherep-Spiridovich, that the Rothschild family fortune in 1925 was $300,000,000,000, and that they made $100,000,000,000 of that sum out of the late world war, now called World War I. 18 This appears to be a very conservative estimate. We have had a number of minor wars since that (late and two major depressions, viz., the disaster of 1929-1930 and the Roosevelt debacle of 1937, as a result of which stocks have fluctuated violently in value. It is likely that the Rothschild family fortune is now in the neighborhood of $500,000,000,000, which is about twice the val- ue of the wealth of all the people of the United States.   17 Jewish Ency., Vol 10, p. 493‐495. 18 \"The Secret World Government, or The Hidden Hand.\""},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"51 three times as wealthy as J.

It is rare that we get even a glimpse of the wealth of any individual member of the fami- ly. It is the history of the Rothschild family that all of its members conceal their wealth in every possible way. This is do ne not only in pursuance of the will of the founder of the fortune, but also to enable them to accomplish their pur- poses as set forth in the protocols. It is estimated that the Jews have absorbed four-fifths of the wealth of Germa- ny, Austria, Poland, and Czechoslovakia, and more than one-half of that of England, France, and Italy. They practically own the banks, railways, steel and munitions plants of these countries, to say nothing of the Press and other mi- nor industries. They undoubtedly own approximately one-half of the wealth of America. With one or two possible exceptions they own the huge New York banks (which implies the control of the New York Federal Reserve Bank), the insurance companies, the railroads, 70% of the steel and munitions industries, 80% of the metropolitan press, the news and advertising agencies, the cinema, and 80% of the radio broadcasting companie s. Wherever there is a monopoly a Jew will likely be found in control of it. J. P. Morgan & Company, with assets of $640,000,000, about one-half of which is cash and the other one-half ta x exempt bonds, has always been re- garded as a Gentile firm that was practically owned and controlled by the Mor- gan family. The recent testimony taken by the Temporary National Economic Committee discloses 19 the fact that J. P. Morgan only holds 9.1% interest in that firm; it also discloses that H. B. Davison had only 1.2%, George Whitney 1.9%, and that the other partners had inte rests of from 1/10 of 1% up to 6.1%, with the exception of the Chas. W. Steele Estate and Thos. W. Lamont who held 36.6% and 34.2% respectively. J. P. Morgan is a man of great wealth; Thos. W. Lamont has never been re- garded as a very rich man, and Chas. W. Steele was unknown to the public. In proportion to their interest in the Morgan firm they are due to be more than rgan. It is not likely that Lamont and Steele tages as shown.

Morgan & Company is but a Rothschild \"front.\" If true, it explains the fact that there is never any competition between Morgan & Company and Kuhn, Loeb & Com- pany; on the other hand, there is always the closest cooperation. It is a circumstance worthy of note that the Temporary National Economic Committee has not investigated the firm of Kuhn, Loeb & Company and that this firm was not investigated by the former senate investigating committee. Is it only an accidental circ umstance that Kuhn, Loeb & Co. are always left out of the investigations? This firm is the auth or of most of the devilment and we are entitled to know about its secret operations, such as the financing of Lenin and Trotsky. The firm of Kuhn, Loeb & Company is reported to be a Rothschild firm, owned \"lock, stock and barrel\" by the Rothschild interest. An investigation of this firm will no doubt reveal that fact; it will no doubt reveal the further fact that its capital is largely cash and tax exempt bonds. The Rothschilds appear to be willing, in order to appease the public demands for information, to sacrifice the bank wherein they have only a 70% interest, and to make it the \"goat\" for public investigations. It appears from the former senate comm ittee investigation that neither J. P. Morgan nor Thos. W. Lamont pay any income taxes. They adopt the scheme of selling securities at a loss just before the first of January to friends or relatives, which losses are offset against their profits, with the result that they have no profits. It is likely that the members of the Kuhn-Loeb firm do likewise. With the Gentiles paying income taxes and the Jews owning tax exempt bonds and dodging them, it will not be long until they absorb the greater part of the wealth of the country—if they have not already done so. There are many other rich Jews in addition to the Rothschilds, but the huge Rothschild fortune represents the greater part of the wealth of all the Jews of the world.

THE MIGHTY ROTHSCHILD POWER \"Therefore we must not stop at bribery, deceit and treachery when they should serve towards the attainment of our end. In pol- itics one must know how to seize the property of others without hesitation if by it we secure su bmission and sovereignty.\"— From Protocol 2. The first manifestation of the power of this concentrated wealth was to free the Jews from the bondage in which they had been held by the various govern- ments of Europe. When William of Hesse placed his money in the hands of Mayer Amschel Rothschild the Jews were without the privilege of citizenship in Germany and all other countries, and were subject to all manner of burden- some taxes. It is said that they were the unofficial tax gatherers for the British kings during the reign of the Norman monarchy—the Jews squeezed the people and the kings squeezed the Jews. The historian Reeves graphically states the achievements of the Rothschild fortune as follows: \"Little could Mayer Amschel have anticipated *** that his sons would in after years come to exercise such an unbounded sway that the peace of nations would de pend upon their nod; that the powerful control they exercised on the European money markets would enable them to pose as the arbiters of peace and war, since they could at their pleasure withhold or furnish the pecuniary means required to carry on a campaign. \"But this, incredible as it may seem, was what their vast influence, combined with their enormous wealth and unlimited credit, enabled them to do, for no firms existed strong enou gh to oppose them for any length of time, or ra sh enough to take up a business which the Rothschilds had refused. To reach this exalted position Mayer Amschel and his sons required the co-operation of the States, but, when once he had climbed over their backs and reached the height of his ambition , he was independent of all aid and could act with the greatest freedom, whilst the States re- tude at his feet.\" mained in a suppliant atti   21 21 The Rothschilds,\" by John Reeves, p. 104-105."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"56 This power brought about the establishment of the gold standard, first in the British Empire and then in other countr ies, as stated in a succeeding chapter of this volume. They acquired the contro lling interest in the Bank of England for which the late Lord Rothschild acted as gold agent and governor. The Bank of England is one of their many \"fronts.\" They no doubt have the controlling interest in most of the ot her central banks of issue. In strict keeping with the secrecy, which has been one of the cardinal prin- ciples of the Rothschild rulers from the beginning, the Bank of England refuses to reveal its stockholders. There have been many investigations which have sought to gain this information, among ot hers a direct order of Parliament, but it has never been disclosed. It is my information that the ownership of the other banks of issue of Europe is also kept a profound secret. They sent one of the Rothschild agents, Paul Warburg, as their representative to America just prior to World War I, to change our banking systems. They knew that we would acquire the greater part of the gold of the world in pay- ment of our exports and they wanted to sterilize this gold in order to control our economy and that of other countries. Under the pretense of organizing a credit expanding system to meet the demands of commerce, they in fact orga- nized a credit contracting system to hold it in leash and to increase the power and value of money. Through their ownership and control of their Morgan & Co., and Kuhn, Loeb & Co., private banks, they own and control the principal New York national banks and trust companies, and through them own and control the New York Federal Reserve Bank. This branch of th e Federal Reserve System according to a recent statement has resources of $1 0,035,211,000 as against the resources of the other eleven F. R. banks of $11,744,034,000. It has gold certificates of $8,934,442,000 as against the gold certificates of the other eleven F. R. banks of $10,094,036,000. According to pro-Jewish Senator Carter Glass this gold belongs to the certifi- cate holders. It should be observed that the United States government issued gold certificates for the gold held by foreigners and the Re serve banks but did not issue such certificates for gold held by other banks or individuals; they received Federal Reserve Bank notes wh ich are withdrawable and subject to cancellation at the pleasure of the Federal Reserve management. The explanation is simple: Such certificates if issued to individuals and banks generally in the United States would be in circulation and therefore enhance the value of property and service and would cheapen money, but the certifi- cates issued to the Federal Reserve Banks are locked in their vaults and there-"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"57 1873—\"the crime of '73.\" This wa by kept out of circulation, and the certif icates issued to foreigners are sent out of the country. The Rothschilds, through the Sassoons (one of the female branches of their family), own and control the banks of China and India. They also own, control and operate the immensely prof itable, illicit opium trade. A number of rich Catholics undertook to organize a competitor bank to rival the Rothschild power. I have been unable to discover when this enterprise was launched, but it was sometime about 1830. The Rothschilds crushed it. The Jewish Encyclopedia admits that \"Following the failure of the Catholic bank, Union Generals, leav- ing the Rothschilds still more absolu tely the undisputed leaders of French finance, but leaving also a legacy of hatred which had much influence on the growth of the anti-Semitic movement in France.\" It says further: \"It is a somewhat curious sequel to the attempt to set up a Catholic competitor to the Rothschilds that at the present time (1905) the latter are the guardians of the papal treasure.\" 22 If this latter statement is true the Rothschilds control in addition to their own fortune the immense liquid resource of the Catholic Church, which is second only to the Rothschilds' in wealth and power. It is probably not literally true since the private banking firm did not do commercial banking. It is likely that the papal treasure is deposited with the Bank of England or some other bank \"front,\" but even so it contributes to the Rothschild power. It should be observed from the above quotation that the Rothschilds brought on a major depression which provoked anti-Semitism. I identify this as the catastrophe of 1839-1840, known as th e \"hungry forties,\" which our American historians have wrongfully ascribed to the veto of the charter of the Second Bank of the United States by Andrew Jackson in 1836. The next major depression in this country and throughout the world was in s brought about by the demonetization of   22 Jewish Ency. Vol. 2, p. 497."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"58 of organizing a currency and cred   silver. The Rothschilds had already brought about the demonetization of silver in Germany as a part of their plan to \"facilitate the payment of the French in- demnity to Germany,\" but it was necessary to the perfection of this plan that the gold standard be established in America. Through bribery, they caused to be clandestinely inse rted a clause in the Coinage Act of 1873 that demonetized silver. The next major depression in America and throughout the world was the panic of 1893 which was brought about by the competition between the Jewish House of Rothschild and the Jewish riva l firm of Baring Brothers. The ruler of the Rothschilds determined to crush the Baring firm. The Jewish Encyclopedia says of this operation: \"Similarly it is stated that the financial crisis of Germany and Austria (and America and the world) was also a source of anti- Semitism because the shrewdness of the Jewish bankers had fore- seen the crash and they were enabled to evade it.\" 23 The Jews are always able to foresee and evade these depressions because they create them. They not only evade these crises but they sell their securities in advance of them and buy them back when values have been destroyed, at a fraction of their former worth, and thereby make immense profits. It is by the repetition of this process from panic to panic that they have so rapidly ac- quired the wealth of the world. The Jews do not lose on a panic, for the word is passed down when it is to happen. They usually profit by it; a panic is their rich harvest. The next major panic was that of 1907 which the Rothschild controlled banks created by refusing to pay their customers and their bank correspondents the money due them and which was held on deposit. They simply coldly and bru- tally said to the other bankers having deposits with them: We cannot and will not pay you your money, and you must take care of your own customers the best way you can. This resulted in all the banks throughout the country clamp- ing down on their customers and refusing to pay them their money, which in turn resulted in checking all commercia l enterprises and a great fall in the wage and price level and a disastrous panic. It resulted also in the people and the bankers getting together for the purpose it expanding system to prevent a recurrence 23 Vol. 2, p. 493."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"59 of such a panic. And worst of all the outcome was that the Rothschilds orga- nized this system for us and created on e that they could manipulate in bring- ing about future panics and through which they could fix and regulate the wage and price level. That system has been responsible for the depressions of 1920, 1930 and the present Roosevelt depression of 1937 (still with us now, in 1940) which resulted in the \"New Deal\" and general bankruptcy. We have had these depressions so frequently and regularly that we have come to regard them as natural phenomena. There are economists who attempted to predict them. They usually occur about every ten years, but F. D. Roosevelt was a little impatient to put over his \"New Deal\" and his communistic pro- gram, and he brought the last one on us ahead of time in order to complete the job which he started in 1933. They ha ve all been manipulated, and for the same purpose, viz., thievery and robbery and to establish the Kingdom of Ju- dah throughout the world. As cruel and destructive as these panics are, they are not as bad as war. The Rothschild power was responsible for World War I and for the present world war, as will be shown later in this vo lume. They have been responsible for most of the wars that have occurred within the last 150 years. They usually finance both sides of these wars, not because they are interested in either side winning but because wars are demoralizing and destructive to the Gentiles and because they bring the Jews nearer their ultimate goal, viz., rulers of the world. Wars are their shortest and quickest route to the throne. The accumulation of compound interest is entirely too slow for them. The robbery of the people through their manipulation of money and credit, as effective as it is, is also too slow. War, with all of its attendant human misery, is their surest and best route—and so we have wars and will continue to have them so long as this power dominates the world. In 1844 \"Sidonia\" (Rothschild) said, in \"Coningsby\": \"No penal laws, no physical tortur es, can effect that a superior race should be absorbed in an inferior, or be destroyed by it. The mixed persecuting races disappear; the pure persecuted race re- mains . . . \"The first Jesuits were Jews; th at mysterious Russian diplomacy which so alarms Western Europe is organized and principally carried on by Jews; that mighty revolution which is at this mo- ment preparing in Germany . . . is entirely developing under the"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"60   auspices of Jews, who almost monopolize the professorial chairs of Germany.\" \"Sidonia\" further says: \"I had on my arrival (at St. Petersburg) an interview with the Russian Minister of Finance, Count Cancrin; I beheld the son of a Lithuanian Jew . . . I had an audi ence on my arrival at Madrid with the Spanish minister; I beheld one like myself, the son of a Nuovo Christiano, a Jew of Aragon. In consequence of what transpired at Madrid I went straight to consult the President of the French Council; I beheld the son of a French Jew . . . We fixed on Prussia . . . Count Arnim ente red the cabinet, and I beheld a Prussian Jew. So you see, my dear Coningsby, that the world is governed by very different personages to what is imagined by those who are not behind the scenes.\" 24 If Sidonia should now, in 1940, make th e rounds of the capitals of Europe, he would find a considerable change in th e situation. He would find the Jews struggling to maintain their political po wer and their sacrosanct gold standard, using Gentile \"fronts\" and Gentile armies and navies for that purpose. He would find that Hitler had driven the Jews from the capitols of Germany, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Denmark, Norway, Holland, Belgium, France, and Roumania—and that he was engaged in a struggle to drive them from England. He would find that Muss olini had driven them from Italy, Al- bania, and Ethiopia. But he would still find them at the helm of the British Government-—and I regret to say the United States Government also. A country engaged in war must buy from other countries many products re- quired for its prosecution. That requires money that is acceptable to the seller, which has heretofore meant gold, because the moneys of the principal export- ing countries have been based on gold. It has therefore been necessary to apply to the Rothschilds for this firm has, until recent years, been in control of the gold of the world, either directly or through their banks. They have therefore had the power to make or unmake wars. It is the universal gold standard coupled with their universal press ownership and coupled with the secrecy of their operations that have made them masters of the world. 24 \"Coningsby\" by Benjamin Disraeli, p. 207-209."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"VIII. THE \"KEPT\" PRESS \"In the hands of the States of today there is a great force that creates the movement of thought in the people, and that is the Press. The part played by the Pr ess is to keep pointing out re- quirements supposed to be indisp ensable, to give voice to the complaints of the people, to express and to create discontent. It is in the Press that the triumph of freedom of speech finds its incar- nation. But the goyim States have not known how to make use of this force; and it has fallen into our hands. Through the Press we have gained the power to influence while remaining ourselves in the shade; thanks to the Press we have got the gold in our hands, notwithstanding that we have had to gather it out of oceans of blood and tears. But it has paid us, though we have sacrificed many of our people. Each victim on our side is worth in the sight of God a thousand goyim.\"—From Protocol 2. It is true that the Press in the \"goyim States\" has fallen into the hands of the Jews; it is also true that through the Press the Jews have \"gained the power to influence while remaining in the shade.\" It is also true that they have \"got the gold\" in their hands and that they have \"had to gather it out of oceans of blood and tears\"—but not their blood and tears; they have gathered it from the \"blood and tears\" of th e gullible and despised goyim. The only method by which they could have gained this gold, through the Press and through \"blood and tears\" is by creating wars, which the Press have helped create through their propaganda. It is difficult to prove to what extent the Jews are directly interested in the Press, for they conceal it. They are reputed to own 100% of the metropolitan newspapers of both England and France , and likewise 100% of the news and advertising agencies and the cinema of these two countries. In America the ownership is not so complete. It is estimated that the Jews own 80% of the metropolitan press and 100% of the news and advertising agencies and cinema. Fortunately, their ownershi p of the small daily papers and coun- try papers appears to be negligible; their influence with these papers is through their news agencies from which the country press obtains news, and their advertising agencies through which they obtain advertisements. The Jews also own about 80% of the radio broadcasting stations through their ownership of Columbia Broadcasting System, Radio Corporation of America,"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"62 and Mutual Broadcasting Company. The Jew Sarnoff is at the head of RCA which controls the National Broadcasting Company, and the Jew Paley is head of CBS, and the Jew Strauss is the reputed owner of the Mutual, The Jews have been acquiring the periodicals so rapidly in recent years that it is impossible to estimate their present holdings. They acquired the very informative and useful \"Literary Digest\" and junked it, and instead gave us the jazzy \"Time\" and \"Life.\" They are reputed to have acquired the \"Saturday Evening Post\" and perverted its high standards and principles. The Post was founded by Benjamin Fran klin and it has always been free and independent and bold in its editorial expr ession. It was an outstanding critic of the New Deal and the perversion of the government by the Roosevelt Adminis- tration, but it has been silenced by its present Jew owners; they have put it to sleep permanently. There is not now in this broad land of ours a single period- ical or metropolitan newspaper that stan ds for constitutional government as it has been handed down to us by our ancestors. The Press has degenerated under Jewish control and influence into lying propaganda agencies whose chief mission appears to be to deceive and to be- fuddle the people. In Protocol 12 the Elders of Zion say of the Press: \"Not a single announcement will reach the public without our con- trol. Even now this is already being attained by us inasmuch as all news items are received by a few agencies, in whose offices they are focused from all parts of the world. These agencies will then be already entirely ours and will give publicity only to what we dictate to them.\" It is literally true that all \"news items ar e received by a few agencies.\" It is also true that these agencies are \"entirely ours.\" It is also true that they only give publicity to \"what we dictate to them.\" It is also true that all of the news that reaches us is under their control. This protocol was promulgated prior to 1905. The situation there described is precisely the condition that now prevails. We are getting only such war news as they choose to give us, and they choose to give us only that which will favor England because they (the Jews) are waging this war through Britain for the Jews and their restoration of Poland and Czechoslovakia and for the mainten- ance of their gold stan dard and their power. The British Press manifested its mighty power in Great Britain by overthrow- ing the Chamberlain government and establishing in place of it the pro-Jewish Churchill-Eden-Cooper government. The Press of England with one accord"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"63 demanded a more vigorous prosecution of the war and made Chamberlain the \"goat\" because of the reverses of the Allies in Norway. There is reason to be- lieve that the people of the British Empire, like the people of America, don't want war but it is the Jews and their Press that are demanding it, and through their control of the government are waging it. In the Funeral Oration of Rabbi Reichhorn pronounced in Prague in 1869 over the tomb of Grand Rabbi Simeon-ben-Ihuda, he said: \"The other great power is The Press. By repeating without cessa- tion certain ideas, the Press succeeds in the end in having them accepted as actualities. The Theatre renders us analogous servic- es. Everywhere the Press and the Theatre obey our orders.\" That furnishes an explanation of all of this war propaganda to which we are now being subjected. It will be observ ed that by repeating a falsehood from time to time they say it will be \"in the end accepted as an actuality.\" We con- stantly have before us the proof of that statement. Every member of the Congress who has any knowledge of the money question knows that the only remedy for the existing depression is what the Jews and their columnists and \"kept\" Press call inflation; they know that inflation means high prices and wages and cheap money, but there is not one of them who will dare publicly announce th at he stands for inflatio n—not one. On the other hand he will hold his hands up in holy horror against it, will talk about its abuses in Germany, France, etc. Why? Simply because the Jews have held inflation up to scorn so often and ridiculed it so repeatedly that it has be come anathema, and it is accepted as an \"actuality\" that any sort of inflation wo uld be a great misfortune; this, despite the fact that they know there can be no relief from deflation without it. It is fear of the Jew press. Why have the Jews acquired the Press and other publicity agencies in America and other countries unless it is for the pu rposes as stated in the protocols? Has it just so happened without any sort of design that the Jews have acquired all the agencies in all of the countries of the world that direct and influence and control the \"movement of thought in the people?\" The Press is presumed to voice the sentiment of the people but it in fact voices only the sentiment of the Jews."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"64 The Press has a very important influence in the election of our public officials. No man can be nominated or elected President of the United States without publicity, and he must go to the Jews and their Press, their cinema, and their radio to get it; it can be obtained nowhere else. He can't get to first base with- out it. The result is that some of the presidents of the United States have been se- lected and elected by the Jews; that is true of at least two democratic presi- dents, but it may not be true of any of the republicans, except Hoover. The result is also that congress and the President are subservient to Jewish control. The result is also that no politician wi ll dare criticize the Jewish race and that all with one accord praise it and denounce racial prejudice. The power of the press was forcefully stated by Richard B. Sheridan in Parlia- ment: \"Give me the Liberty of The Press and I will give to the minister a venal House of Peers; I will give him a corrupt and servile House of Commons; I will give him the full swing of the patronage of of- fices; I will give him the whole ho st of ministerial influence; I will give him ALL the power that plac e can confer upon him—to pur- chase submission and over-awe resistance. \"Yes, armed with the Liberty of The Press, I will go forth undis- mayed; I will attack the very fabr ic of that mighty engine. I will shake down corruption from its height, and bury it beneath the ruins of the abuses it was meant to shelter.\" In Protocol 7 attached as an Appendix, they say, \"We must compel the gov- ernments of the goyim to take action in the direction favoured by our widely conceived plan, already approaching the desired consummation,\" by that \"great power, the press, which with a fe w exceptions that may be disregarded, is already entirely in our hands.\" That is precisely what they are now doing. They are seeking to compel all governments to join in their \"widely conceived plan\" of a universal war. Through the \"oceans of blood and tears\" of such a war they will again gather much gold and may seize political power and establish their \"King-Despot of the blood of Zion.\" We have the evidence here before our very eyes and yet we refuse to see and recognize it, and the danger of it. We know that the leading newspapers and magazines of this country are in Jewish hands. We know that most of the jour- nalists are Jews and that Jews are the publ icity agents of both political parties. We know that the Jews own and control the cinema and radio. We know that"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"65 the Jew press and the Jew columnist and the Jew radio and the Jew cinema are with one accord conducting a malignant campaign to involve us in the present war. Why? Is it to promote the public welfare? No. Is it to promote the Jewish \"widely conceived plan\"? Yes. There can be no other answer. Our offi- cials are tongue-tied and bound hand and foot, and there appears to be no way to obtain legislative relief. They say in the same protocol (No. 7), \"the principal factor of success in the political is the secrecy of its undertakin gs.\" In other words, it is humbuggery and deception. How lamentably true. If we knew the truth and the whole truth we might correct it, but so long as they can deceive us there is but little chance for it. They conceal the fact that they own the leading newspapers and maga- zines and banking institutions. They hide behind corporate names and dummy stockholders. When the truth is stated they deny it. In their protocols they say \"with a few exceptions that may be disregarded, it (the press) is already enti rely in our hands.\" This has reference to the press of the whole world. This was prior to 1905, but it appears to still be true, with the exception of Germany and Italy. (The governments of France and Romania have recently disfranchised the Jews and decreed that they shall have no sort of connection with the press). It is unthinkable that the Rothschild power manufactures public opinion throughout the entire world through their own- ership of the press, and that they are us ing this power to create wars and gath- er gold from \"oceans of blood and tears.\" They say they own the press and the known facts verify the truth of that state- ment. They say they have acquired it \"to compel the governments of the goyim in the direction favored by our widely conceived plan;\" and they are using it for that purpose. They say that through it and through \"oceans of blood and tears\" they have acquired the gold of the world, and that is true.

Editorial de- partments of the newspapers are controlled chiefly through Jew- ish advertising influence. Many Jews are in the Associated Press and United Press Assn., and the Hearsts papers are Jew- directed.\" 25 There are also many other under-cover stockholders and bondholders. The columnist, Boake Carter, stated in on e of his syndicated articles that \"re- cently a considerable block of stock was opened to public sale by the Chicago Daily News (Col. Knox's paper). Among the largest buyers was Kuhn, Loeb & Co.\" This reveals one of the methods by which the Jews have obtained control of the press. The Jews also own the International Paper Co., which extends credit to many newspapers and owns the stock and bonds of many of them. Whenever a leading newspaper gets in financial distress or comes on the mar- ket, the Jews grab it up. It is a significant fact that every Jew columnist is for war against Germany and every Gentile columnist is against it; it is also significant that every Jew con- gressman is for war, and the Gentile congressmen are practically unanimously against it; it is also significant that the city Jew press is for war and the country Gentile press against it. We Gentiles have not yet forgotten the ingratitude shown us by the Allies fol- lowing World War I. They said that we did not win it, that they did. They said also that they were fighting for us and that we should bear the expenses of the war and they refused to pay the loans made them since the war, on that flimsy ground. They called us \"Uncle Shylock\" because we expected payment of these debts, amounting to over $12,000,000,000.

If the real truth were known there would be no intervention sentiment in this country, and there would be very little pro-British sentiment. If the real Jewish names of these journalists and the fact that they are Jews were stated in con- nection with their columns, their views would carry but little weight; and if \"our widely conceived plan\" were wide ly understood, they would carry none.

We and our children must be entertained with Jewish humor, reconciled to racial equality by Jew- ish propaganda, and deceived by Jewish lies.

The radio and cinema are not mentioned in the protocols for the very good reason that they were not then in use. As soon as these two methods of in- fluencing the public mind and creating sentiment were developed, they were both acquired by the Jews—not only here in America but in every country of the world.

And the radio and cinema are being used for that purpos e continuously, consistently, and relen- tlessly. There can be no reasonable doubt about the authenticity of the protocols.

THE MURDER GANG \"Death is the inevitable end for all. It is better to bring that end nearer to those who hinder our affairs than to our selves—the founders of this affair.

It may be true, as the Jews claim, that they originated masonry. There are many signs and symbols of masonry, as we Americans know it, that indicate it, but our masonry, as has heretofore been pointed out, is entirely separate and different from theirs; theirs is a secret clannish political agency to preserve their solidarity, to act as a unit, and to carry into effect the orders of their ru- lers. The B'nai B'rith appears to have been founded in America and to be the Amer- ican branch of the Jewish continental masons; there is no occasion here for another openly avowed benevolent Masonic order since the Jews are permit- ted to join the American masons. \"What is the B'nai B'rith?\" \"An international secret Jewish 'masonic order' known among the tribes as 'Sons of the Covenant' (circumcision), of which Henry Monsky of Chicago is President. It was founded in New York in 1843. Jewish Author Ludwig Lewisohn says 'B'nai B'rith represents Jewry the world over'.\" \"What are its objectives?\" \"To promote what it calls 'The Jewish Common Purpose,' which is domination of Gentiledom.

The Nihilists of Russia was reputed to be another branch through which they murdered the Czars of Russia and the rulers of other countries. It was probably the Continental Masons who selected Herschel Grynszpan to murder Von Rath, the German attaché in France, for the Jews have made a hero of him; they have throughout the world applauded this dastardly act, raised huge sums of money and employed many lawyers for his defense. The Jewish French government never arraigned him for trial but the present gov- ernment will likely do so. He proposed to volunteer to fight for France, which was headlined in the Jewish press all over the world. Adolf Hitler accepted this political assassination as being a racial murder in pursuance of their racial plans and accordingly imposed a fine of $400,000,000 on the Jewish race in Germany. It is estimated that when the Jews obtained control of the Russian government they put to death 3,000,000 of the best and most important Gentile citizens of the Russian Empire, and later starved to death more than 20,000,000 of them. When the Jew Bela Kuhn (Aaron Cohn) obtained control of the Hunga- rian government, his first act was to mur der 20,000 of the leading Gentiles of that country. It is reported that 70 0,000 Hungarians were killed during his 133 days of rule of Hungary and immediately preceding and following it. 27 The same thing occurred in Germany. Adolf Hitler is authority for the state- ment that between 4,000 and 5,000 of the best people of Germany were promptly executed when the Jews obtained control of the government. This is all in pursuance of their protocols and their Talmud and their commun- ist code. Their Talmud teaches them that \"the life of a goi and all his physical powers belong to a Jew,\" and their protocols tell them that death is the \"inevit- able end for all and that it is better to bring that end nearer to those who hind- he founders of this affair.\"   26 icans,\" Apr. 15, 1940.

They have always im- agined themselves superior to the peoples of the countries wherein they dwelt. They have outwitted and cheated and de spoiled other peoples until it has be- come a part of their nature. The present Jew is the product of his ancestors; he has inherited many of their characteristics. His civilization is but veneer, and a thin one at that. He ill- conceals his vanity and egotism and deceitfulness and cruelty and grasping nature. Murder is difficult to prove at best, and it is impossible when it is done in such manner that \"none save the brotherhood can even have a suspicion of it—not even the victims of our death sentence; they all die when required, as if from a normal kind of illness.\" This can explain the alleged murder of President Harding; and also the alleged murder of the late, blind Senator Schall of Min- nesota who was an able and outstanding critic of the present Jew administra- tion and \"Jew Deal.\" He was run over on the street by a \"hit and run\" driver whose identity has never been discovered. It may also explain the alleged as- sassination of Senator Bronson Cutting who was also an able critic of the \"New Deal,\" and likewise guilty of \"hindering our affairs.\" He was killed in a plane crash. It was stated at the time that the plane had been tampered with and that an investigation would be made, but that was the end of it. We have had a singular fatality among our Presidents. None of them was mur- dered during the approximate ninety years prior to the civil war when the Jew- ish influence was negligible; three and pr obably four of them have been mur- dered during the 75 years since: Lincoln by the Jew Booth; Garfield by Chas. Jules Guitau, nationality unknown; McKinney by the Jew Leon Czolgosz; and probably Harding. During the years since the civil war the Jews have financed the campaigns of Woodrow Wilson and Franklin D. Roosev elt, and have consequently contri- buted very largely to the election of two of the three democratic presidents since the war. The Jews have not so far as known, financed and brought about the election of any of the republican presidents except Hoover,—and perhaps Coolidge who had his Jew sponsor, Stearn. Of the other five elected republican presidents three of them were murdered; a strange fatality of the non-Jewish republican presidents."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"72 All of this may have just happened and not been brought about by any sinister organization or power. There is, however, at least one murder of a prominent senator who \"hindered their affairs\" that is definitely known—viz., the late Senator Huey Long of Louisiana who was shot down in the Louisiana State House. His friend, Governor Allen, who succeeded him and who was investi- gating his death, himself died \"as from a normal kind of illness\"—suddenly and mysteriously. We also know that prior to Senator Lo ng's death the Jewish federal govern- ment refused federal aid to the people of Louisiana, for reli ef or in any other form. Immediately after he was murdered the federal treasury was opened up and money flowed into Louisiana. It ha s been aptly called \"the second Louisi- ana purchase.\" At the time of Senator Long's murder a number of federal indictments were pending against Sol Weiss, his Jew trea surer, and other leaders in the Long political machine; soon after his deat h these indictments were dismissed. These men were evidently promised security and felt secure, because their misconduct afterward became so flagrant that they were re-indicted and have recently been tried and convicted. It has been frequently stated in the press that the killing of Senator Long was an \"inside job.\" It is probable that the dismissal of these indictments and his murder were arranged beforehand. He was killed by a man by the name of Weiss, supposedly a Jew and a relative of Sol Weiss, his treasurer. Henry Ford first opened the eyes of the people of America to the Jew menace. He caused to be published three volumes entitled \"The International Jew,\" which revealed the fact that the Jews are the real financial power that controls America. He also published \"The De arborn Independent,\" which was esti- mated to have a circulation of almost a million, and which informed its readers about the machinations of the Jews. Among other things, it attacked the Jew Aaron Shapiro because of his graft in connection with the organization of the farmer co-operatives. Shapiro filed suit against Mr. Ford for libel for several million dollars, his attorneys being the Jew firm of Untermeyer & Marshall, New York lawyers for the Rothschild interest. Late one night while returning home from his office, a \"hit and run\" driver sideswiped Mr. Ford's car and forced it down a steep embankment and he was seriously but not fatally injured. Shortly thereafter he evidently compromised with the Jews on the basis of discontinuing the publication of The Dearborn Independent. The Shapiro suit was dismissed, the press ridicule of Mr. Ford ceased; they even speak of him kindly now."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"73 The \"hit and run\" driver was never discovered.

Martin Luther is credited with saying that the Jews are \"liars, thieves, and murderers.\" They are taught to be by both their Talmud and their protocols. It is a terrific indictment against the Jewish race. It is undoubtedly true of the \"Learned Elders of Zion.\" We prefer to believe that the Jews with whom we come in daily contact are different. But we cannot close our eyes to the disa- greeable fact that this indictment is confirmed by the Talmud, the protocols and the history of the Jewish race. We have just witnessed another tragic death of a great American Senator who \"hindered our affairs,\" viz: Senator Lundeen of Minnesota. He was murdered in the same way they murdered Senator Cutting. They were both travelling in airplanes out of Washington, and in bo th cases the plane developed engine trouble a short distance out of the city. There were other passengers on both planes (24 on the last) but that small circumstance was a matter of no conse- quence to the murderers. These are murders that appear to be fr om a \"normal kind of accident,\" and they are well hidden, for there was no one left in either case to tell the story. They are not \"normal\" for the Cutting and Lundeen plane crashes are the only accidents of that character that have oc curred in the fifteen years of passenger air travel. There are not many senators of the Lund een type left. Four of them have met violent deaths, viz: Senators Long, Schall, Cutting, and now Senator Lundeen.

WORLD WAR I \"We shall force the Christians into wars by exploiting their pride and their stupidity. They will massacre each other and clear the ground for us.\"—From Funeral Oration of Rabbi Reichhorn. Kaiser Wilhelm of Germany was a very vain man who loved publicity and im- agined himself an autocrat, but in fact he was only a figurehead, as King George VI of England now is, and as most of the European monarchs are now and were at that time. The Jews encour aged him in this delusion and fed his vanity, while they operated his government. The important ministers of Germany—th ose that really ran the government— were all Jews. Bethmann Holweg, chancellor and spokesman, was a descen- dant of the Rothschilds, Walter Rathneau, treasurer, and Felix Warburg, head of the spy system, together with five other members of the Kaiser's cabinet, were Jews. The Jews in 1914 were more completely in control of the govern- ments of Europe than they were in 1844 when Disraeli's \"Sidonia\" (Roth- schild) visited the various capitals of Europe. Sidonia then with words of prophecy visioned the world war: \"That mighty revolution which is at this moment preparing in Germany . . . is entirely developi ng under the auspices of Jews who almost monopolize the professorial chairs of Germany.\" It was, however, a world war that the Jews developed, and not a mere revolu- tion. The assassination of Archduke Fe rdinand and his wife was given as the excuse for it but that was not the cause; it was only a pretext. There was no redress or attempted redress of this a ssassination; the Duke and Duchess were soon forgotten. The real cause of the war was Jewish ambition and avarice; it had been planned for a long period of ti me; they merely seized upon this cir- cumstance to fool the gullible goyim. We are all presumed to intend the consequences of our acts. We judge the cause by the effect. The effect of the war was the League of Nations, the estab- lishment of the gold standard through out the world, and Palestine for the Jews. This would probably have been the effect of the war if Germany had won, for the Jews even in that case would have written the peace treaty just as they did at the conclusion of the victor y of the Allies. The accomplishment of these three things was the purpose of Wo rld War I—and, with the exception of Palestine, is the purpose of World War II."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"76 These things did not just happen by accident; they were all pre-arranged. The cunning of the Jew is uncanny. It is the result of centuries of imagined supe- riority and suppression and scheming and nursed vengeance.

They knew that they would write the peace treaty and gather in the spoils. The German government sought to alienate Russia from the Allies during World War I, and accomplished it through the Jews. The German Jew gov- ernment furnished a train and transportation for Lenin and his gang through Germany to Moscow, and the Jews financed the enterprise. Among the Jews that put up the money were Paul Warb urg, governor of our Federal Reserve System, and the Rothschild firm of Kuhn, Loeb & Co. These gentlemen now deny it. When their rascality is discovered the Jews always \"deny the allegation and defy the allegator.\" Father Coughlin made this charge in one of his radio addresses and it was challenged by Kuhn, Loeb & Co. In a book entitled \"An Answer to Father Coughlin's Critics\" the truth of this ch arge has been established beyond any reasonable doubt. This book further establishes beyond a reasonable doubt that the Jews not only overthrew the Czarist government in Russia, but that they executed the Czar and his family, and established their own government in place of it.

It has taken 22 years to find out the whole story of our betrayal into World War I. We are indebted to Senator Gera ld P. Nye of North Dakota for digging into the records and bringing to light the Balfour-Lansing correspondence by which President Wilson is shown to have agreed to enter the war long prior to the sinking of the Lusitania. This correspondence, however, did not di sclose the real reason for our action, the motive for President Wilson's change of front and how the change was brought about. In his tireless effort to keep this country out of war, Senator Nye discovered and revealed the truth, and the real reason for President Wil- son's change of front. Prior to these revelations we thought we entered the war because of the sink- ing of the Lusitania and the violation of our rights as a neutral. That was the reason assigned by President Wilson in his dramatic message to Congress, but it was not the real reason, as conclusively shown by the Balfour-Lansing cor- respondence. It was only a pretext to secure the support of Congress and the people. There can be no doubt about the fact that prior to President Wilson's second election in 1916 he \"kept us out of the war.\" There can likewise be no doubt about the fact that he was reelected up on that slogan. Why did he change his position soon after his election? Why did he make an agreement with the Brit- ish government to help the Allies? That has been, until now, an unexplained mystery. The answer is the Jew and Palestine. \"Believe it or not,\" President Wilson sa- crificed 50,000 of the flower of our youth, caused 200,000 more to be maimed and crippled, and gave $50,000,000,000 of our wealth, in order to restore Palestine to the Jews—a small barren country that probably could have been bought for a billion dollars or less. Worse than that, he took us into the war for the purpose of treacherously taking the homeland from one of our own Allies, the Arabs, who were fighting side by side with our soldiers.

I have been unable to obtain any trace of his background or of his connections; but the editor-in- chief of all these works, including\" the one entitled 'Propaganda for the Next War,' is a man whose name is recognized the world over as an authority in Great Britain. He is none other than Capt. Liddell Hart, associated with the London Times, a writer and a military authority in Europe.\" The following are quotations from this authority: \"For some time the issue as to which side the United States would take hung in the balance, and the final result was a credit to our propaganda (meaning the British propaganda) . . . \"There remain the Jews. It has be en estimated that of the world Jew population of approximately 15,000,000, no fewer than 5,000,000 are in the United States; 25% of the inhabitants of New York are Jews. During the Great War we bought off this huge American Jewish public by the promise of the Jewish National Home in Palestine, held by Ludend orff to be the master stroke of allied propaganda, as it enabled us not only to appeal to Jews in America but to Jews in Germany as well.\" They \"bought off the huge American Jewish public\" with the promise of Pales- tine and with them they bought the powerful metropolitan Jewish press and the Wilson Administration. That is not my language, nor is it my assertion; it is the language and the statement of fact of an eminent British authority writ- ing for the benefit of the British public, and particularly for the British propa- gandists of the \"next war\"—now in progress. He says of this Propaganda for the Next War, that we (the American people) have been \"fed up\" on atroci ties and that this form of attack will not work next time and that they must adopt new methods.

He suggests the following: \"To persuade her (the United States) to take our part will be much more difficult, so difficult as to be unlikely to succeed. It will need a definite threat to America, a threat, moreover, which will have to be brought home by propaganda to every citizen, before the Republic will again take arms in an external quarrel . . . \"The position will naturally be considerably eased if Japan were involved, and this might and probably would bring America in without further ado. At any rate, it would be a natural and ob- vious object of our propagandists to achieve this, just as during the Great War they succeeded in embroiling the United States with Germany. \"Fortunately with America, our propaganda is on firm ground. We can be entirely sincere, as our main plank will be the old dem- ocratic one. We must clearly enunciate our belief in the democrat- ic form of government and our firm resolve to adhere to it. Our minor propaganda will aim at attaching the support of important sections, such as the Jews, probably by the declaration of a clear- cut policy in Palestine, and of our intention, if victorious, to put an end to anti-Semitic persecutions; and of the Roman Catholic community in similar terms . . . \"In the realm of the moving picture industry we may be able to depend on the natural bias of the United States film manufactur- ers in favor of Great Britain as opposed to Germany, Japan, or Italy, and on their command of the machinery of international film distribution. This will be an asset both with the stock enter- tainment picture and the news reels.\" So their plan was to line up the Jews and \"Catholic community\" by \"promis- ing\" if victorious to \"put an end to anti-Semitic persecutions; and of the Ro- man Catholic community in similar terms.\" The Jews, the Jew press, the Jew cinemas, and the Jew President and his Jew administration, are already lined up; no promises or propaganda were needed for that purpose. But the protestant American has been badly burned, he has had enough of their wars, and it will be difficult to get him into another one by talk and prop- aganda—which they realize. They propose to appeal to his prejudices and fears by getting Japan in on the other side.

The President has dispatched the fleet to the Pacific Ocean. This is for the pur- pose of war with Japan: It can be for no other purpose. If Japan will only tor- pedo one of these boats, the Jewish press, the Jewish radio, and the Jewish cinema will do the rest. The Jew Admiral Taussig stated to a Congressional Investigating Committee that \"war with Japan is inevitable.\" The worst of it is that these slick Jew war-makers will probably themselves torpedo the boat and blame the Japs through their press, cinema, etc., and the result will be the same. We may fight, and investigate later, and may again learn the truth twenty years afterward. They also propose to appeal to us Prot estants on the \"old democratic plank\" that they are democracies and \"believe in the democratic form of government and our firm resolve to adhere to it .\" To hell with such democracies! The British Empire is governed by a King and a Jewish Privy Council and a hereditary House of Lords, was acquired by conquest, is held together by mili- tary power, and is the greatest in area ever known,—upon which it is said the sun never sets. The French Empire, with a Rothschild in her cabinet, and go- verned ordinarily by a bunch of Jews,—was also acquired by conquest, and is the third largest area in the world. The Jewish influence now governs the British Empire. They have many repre- sentatives in the House of Commons through the Labor party. In the House of Lords they predominate thru their purchase of titles and intermarriage with the nobility. Formerly a King selected and appointed his lords and nobles from his brave warriors and landed aristocracy; now he sells these titles to his rich subjects who are principally Jews, and this is a source of considerable revenue to the Crown. The present heads of the British cabinet, viz., Churchill, Eden, Cooper, et al., are all strongly pro-Jewi sh and are all intense haters of Hitler because he is anti-Semitic. America is not a democracy and never has been, and God forbid that it ever shall be. It is a republic whose powers are clearly defined by the Constitution. Referring to the propaganda by the Br itish and German governments during the First World War, the writer correctly observes: \"I repeat it is unthinkable that such a dog-fight between non-Amer icans will again be permitted in the United States.\" It is indeed \"unthinkab le,\" but such propaganda is nevertheless"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"82 being carried on right now by the Jews in the newspapers and cinemas and over their radios.

When World War I ended, the Rothschilds and their agents were there to ad- minister upon the wreckage. \"Elder\" Bernard Baruch, who succeeded E. M.

In his memoirs, Ike Hoover, Chief Usher at the White House during ten ad- ministrations, including the Wilson administration, said: \"The President and Mrs. Wilson went to the country place rented by Mr. Baruch for lunch today (Sunday) and all of us scattered.

Why should this wily Jewish gambler re nt a house and make his headquarters near Versailles during the peace conference, which gave birth to the League of Nations,? What interest had he in the League of Nations? The terms of the peace treaty and the League of Nations were ostensibly agreed upon and fixed by Woodrow Wilson representing the United States Government, Lloyd George representing the British Empire, and Georges Clemenceau representing the French Empire,—but they were in fact largely the work of men behind the scenes, viz., th e \"King-Despot of the blood of Zion\" and his agents representing the Jewish race and money power. It is obvious that Baruch was then and is now the political representative of the Rothschilds in America. Ile was then President Wilson's adviser."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"84 Jews; and established without ou The Jew mentor of David Lloyd-George was Sir Philip A. G. D. Sassoon, Bart., a direct descendant of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, and a member of the British Privy Council. He served Lloyd-George during the peace conference as private secretary which enabled him to \"sit in\" on the secret deliberations of the confe- rees. 30 Jeroboam Rothschild (Mandel) appear s to have held a similar position with Clemenceau. Baruch's position with Wilson was that of an intimate friend and adviser. I quote the magazine \"Time\" as authority for the statement that Georges Man- del, (Jeroboam Rothschild), until recently France's Minister of the Interior, was Clemenceau's \"right bower.\" It says: \"To the vital Ministry of the Interior, Premier Reynaud appointed energetic, 54-year-old Georges Mand el, till then Mi nister of Colo- nies. This was no new job for the sharp-nosed, stocky little Cle- mencist, who as the Tiger's chef de cabinet during the last war ran the country's domestic affairs and kept up civilian morale. Born Jeroboam Rothschild, Mandel has often been called France's Dis- raeli, is a super-politician in a country of politicians, lately showed in the Colonial (and Post Office) Ministry that he had lost none of the drive and administrative flare that made him indis- pensable to Clemenceau. He was so close to the Premier that the Rabelaisian Tiger once quipped: \"Quand je pete, Mandel pue.\" 31 We can now properly appraise this treacherous, criminal peace treaty, out of which has grown the present war. It was not Wilson who betrayed the German government by the promise of his Fourteen Points, nor Lloyd George who was false to the promises made the Arabs to induce them to enter the war. It was Jeroboam Rothschild, Sir Philip Sassoon, and Bernard Baruch. Wilson, Lloyd George and Clemenceau are culpable only to the extent that they acted in ob- edience to a power that they did not dare oppose. These three Jews, representing the money power of the Rothschild family, determined the essential provisions of the infamous peace treaty.

It was our refusal to join that prevented the consummation of their grandiose elaborate machine for the government of the world. These three Jews are responsible for the abandonment of President Wilson's fourteen points and for the flagrant violation of the promises upon which Germany laid down her arms. If President Wilson's pledges had been observed we would have no World War II. Perhaps if we had joined the League of Na- tions there would be none, for we would be the subjects of this \"King-Despot\" who would rule us with an iron hand. They then and there sowed the seeds that have germinated into the present war. Jeroboam Rothschild (Mandel) was a member of the Reynaud cabinet and resigned with him and fled with him when France refused to be \"merged\" into the British Empire but decided instead to surrender. The people of France now appear to realize, according to the press reports, that they are the victims of these warmongers. It will be recalled that on his return to America President Wilson started upon a speaking tour to convert the American people to the League of Nations and that it was during this campaign that , fortunately for America, he had his break down; otherwise he might have put it over. It should also be recalled that due to the opposition of Senators Borah, Johnson, Lodge, Reed, and other stalwart Americans, this grandiose sche me was defeated. It should also be recalled with pride that there was enough Americanism left in the Senate, led by Borah and Johnson and Huey Long, to defeat our entry into the League of Nations through its back door, the so-called \"World Court,\" during the Hoover administration and again during the Roosevelt administration, despite the powerful pressure brought to bear on th e Senate by both of these presidents. The League of Nations scheme did not originate with President Wilson. He made no such claim. Its precise origin is unknown, but the Jews claim credit for it. It is no doubt their baby, for it has all the ear-marks of their craftiness. Its pretended purposes were to form a le ague or coalition of all the nations of the earth for the purpose of preventing future wars, but that was not its real purpose. It was a slick scheme to esta blish a Super-Government to which all the nations of the earth would be subordinate and subservient. There was no authority under our constitution for our gove rnment to become a party to it, even though its purpose had been a worthy one. That small detail, however, \"cut no ice\" with the \"Elder s\" and apparently none with President Wilson. The London Daily Mail said of it that it is \"the most elaborate sham"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"86 which history has yet perpetrated.\" It ha s now discharged all of its employees and closed up its shop. The peace conference appointed Gustav Cassel, a noted monetary authority of Stockholm, Sweden, to advise them, which he did. He wrote for that purpose two memoranda (published in his book entitled \"World's Monetary Prob- lems,\") in which he set forth logically and conclusively that it was absolutely necessary to maintain high prices and wages and cheap money in order to enable the people and nations of the world to pay their debts. He showed con- vincingly that the restoration of the gold standard was impossible, that it would bankrupt the people and government s of all countries, create great dis- tress and unrest and probably lead to war. In the face of the solemn warning prepared especially for the Brussels Finan- cial Conference, this conference decreed the return of the gold standard, with its cheap prices and wages. Professor Cassel told in words of prophecy precise- ly the results that have since happened. The shrewd monetary experts of the Brussels Conference knew what would happen without such advice and they intended the very consequences that followed and that now prevail. Under the pretense of writing a peace treaty with Germany this peace confe- rence established Palestine as a home for the Jews and invested the British Government with a mandate for the government of the country. The Jews have been at war with the Arabs since and the situation has become so intolerable that the British Government sought to divide the country between the Jews and Arabs and to surrender its responsi bility, which pleased neither Jew nor Arab. The Arabs want all of Palestine because it belongs to them and the Jews want it all, although they have not settled it and do not expect to do so. Less than 500,000 Jews have moved there during the twenty-two years since the estab- lishment of this alleged Jewish home. Ma ny of them, after locating there, have moved to America and other countries. More Jews have migrated to America during that period than have settled in Palestine. America is now the \"Pales- tine\" of the Jews. They don't want to be farmers and craftsmen;—that is not their ticket. They prefer that the \"Goyim\" do the work and themselves to live among them and trade with them and manipulate their currency systems. The establishment of this \"Jewish home\" was not involved as an issue in the world war or in the peace treaty with Germany. The Arabs were our allies and they fought side by side with the soldiers of the allies. It was cold blooded, indefensible robbery perpetrated at the instance of the \"Elders\" by Lloyd George and Woodrow Wilson and Georges Clemenceau."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"87 There would have been some justificatio n for it if the British Government had acquired the lands of the Arabs with their consent, paying for them and buying lands sufficient for the whole Jewish race and had thereafter forced all the Jews from all countries to migrate there; that would have done more toward preserving the peace of the world than all of their mandates, the Brussels Fi- nancial Conference, the International La bor Board, and the League of Nations combined. The worst of it is that the establishment of this \"Jewish home\" was cold blooded treachery to the Arab Governme nt and people. The Arabs claim that they were induced to enter the war on the side of the allies by the promise that what is known as the Balfour Declarat ion would be rescinded and that the Arabians would not be molested in th e peaceable ownership and possession of their country. This contention is not denied by the British Government, but the excuse is made that Woodrow Wilson insisted that the Jews be given this home and that Lloyd George consented as a matter of policy and in order to get some other things in the peace treaty that he desired. Palestine is now properly called the \"twice promised land.\" It is likely that Germany also prom- ised it in consideration of the Russian deal. The defenseless Arabs were treacherously ravished by their comrades in arms. If the Jews want this or any other home, let them buy it. That is the honest way to get it, and they have plenty of money for that purpose. Palestine does not belong to them because their ancestors lived there more than fifteen hundred years ago. The most of them have no sentiment about it, for sentiment is not a Jewish characteristic;—with them it is always strictly business. In any event, this home of the Jews was not involved in a peace settlement with Germany; nor was the establishment of an International Labor Board to regulate the wages and conditions of labo r; nor was the restoration of the gold standard; nor was the League of Nations. These are not international subjects, but they are local to each country. It is the province of each and all of the coun- tries of the world to define their own national policies regarding each and all of these important matters.

GOLD \"With gold we can buy the most rebe llious consciences, can fix the rate of all values, the current price of all products, can subsidize all State loans, and thereafter hold the states at our mercy.\"— From Funeral Oration of Rabbi Reichhorn. \"You are aware that the gold standard has been the ruin of the States which adopted it, for it has not been able to satisfy the de- mands for money, the more so th at we have removed gold from circulation as far as possible.\"—From Protocol 20. The fixed policy of the management of the Rothschild fortune is and has al- ways been monopoly. They brook no opposition and they fix the tolls of what- ever business they engage in. In the beginning their operations were confined to government loans, not only for the profit involved but for the political pow- er that it gave them. As the fortune gr ew their field of operations expanded until it embraced everything. Originally, the Rothschilds had competition for these government loans and consequently were not always able to fix the rate of discount, but this opposition was soon crushed or absorbed. Among their early competitors was the Bank of England, which was chartered in 1694 for the purpose of financing th e British Government. In consideration of a loan of 1,200,000 pounds the Br itish government granted the Bank of England the exclusive privilege of issuing currency in the City of London and within a radius of 65 miles thereof. Or iginally it was granted an annuity of 100,000 pounds a year for handling the government's business, and its prop- erty and operations were exempted from taxation. Adam Smith says of the Bank of England: \"She acts not only as an ordinary bank, but as a great engine of state. She receives and pays the greater part of the annuities which are due to the creditors of the public; she circulates Ex- chequer bills; and she advances to the Government the annual amount of the land and malt taxes which are frequently not paid till some years thereafter.\" These functions were in line with the operations of the Rothschilds and conse- quently they coveted the bank. There is no record of when they acquired it or how much they paid for it, for that is not the Rothschild way; it is one of their"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"90 might excite the fears or su skillfully contr  secrets. It was probably acquired by Na than during the hey-day of his activity, sometime around 1830 and as a result of an assault th at he himself made on it. Pretending a grievance, Nathan Rothschild bought up its outstanding notes and personally presented them to the bank for payment day after day, and received coin in payment therefore unti l he practically exhausted the bank's supply. The management of the bank capitulated. From that time until this day the Bank of England has been one of the most effective agencies of the Roth- schilds in promoting their plans. The charter of the bank was amended eight times during the period from 1694 to 1844 when the Peel amendment was adopted; it has never been changed since. The original government loan of 1,200,000 pounds, instead of being paid, was increased from time to time until it had reached the sum of 11,015,000 pounds in 1844, when th e Peel amendment was adopted. This amendment provided in substance that the Bank of England might issue its currency notes up to 15 million pounds upon its general assets, and that all currency issued in excess of this sum must be secured by an equal amount of gold coin or bullion; it also provided that other banks of issue should thereaf- ter increase the amount of their currenc y notes, and then as their charters expired the privilege of issuing currency should be cancelled. The Peel amendment had far-reaching consequences apparent upon its face: (1) It demonetized silver, which theretofore circulated in England and throughout the world money; (2) it gave the Bank of England a monopoly of the rency of the British Empire; (3) it established the gold vertible note on the basis of a 100% gold coverage; (4) it made the Bank of England the clearing house of the British Empire and established the British pound as world cur- rency; (5) it gave the management of the bank the power to fix and regulate prices and wages throughout the British Empire and to materially influence them throughout the world. The Encyclopedia Britannica 32 states regarding the Peel amendment: \"It was indispensable, in attempting to obviate the defects inhe- rent in our currency, to proceed ca utiously, to respect, as far as possible, existing interests, and to avoid taking any step that spicions of the public; but the measures ived as to provoke little opposition, at . . . were so  32 Vol. III, p. 323."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"91 the same time that they effected most important and highly bene- ficial changes\" Sir Robert Peel was then Prime Minister of Great Britain and no doubt favored the amendment to the bank's charter which bears his name, but it was his bill only in the sense that the Federal Reserve Act is President Wilson's bill. The apostate Jew Benjamin Disraeli was then at the head of the opposition party which overthrew the Peel ministry in 1848. Disraeli was subsequently Prime Minister of England. Disraeli was then the intimate friend of Lionel Rothschild whose family at that time owned and controlled the Bank of England and the greater part of the gold of the world. It will be noted that the authority mentioned states that the act and its adoption \"were so skillfully contrived as to provoke little opposi- tion.\" Evidently it had the support of the leaders of both political parties, and evidently it was not understood by the members of parliament and by the people generally, and evidently Disraeli had much to do with it, if he was not in fact its author. It is a singular fact that the bill was put over by the Rothschild agents in pre- cisely the same manner that they put over the Federal Reserve Act. The setting for it was the same, viz: the catastrophe of 1840, which the Rothschilds preci- pitated;—the Federal Reserve Act grew out of the panic of 1907, which the Rothschilds also precipitated. It was similar in its obscure meaning to our Federal Reserve Act. It was put over as a result of a coalition of both political parties,—as was our Federal Reserve Act. It gave the Rothschild management complete dominion over the welfare of the British Empire and our Federal Reserve Act gave it to them over the people of America. It is worthy of note that the Peel amendment was adopted during the same year that Disraeli published his book \"Coningsby,\" which was intended to exalt the Rothschilds and the Jews. Disraeli then said of Lionel Rothschild: \"He was lord and master of the money markets of the world, and of course virtually the lord and master of everything else.\" The so-called Peel amendment enormously magnified the Rothschild power. If there was any question about the head of the Rothschild fortune being \"lord and master of everything else\" prior to 1844, there can be none about his pow- er since.This amendment made him the absolute \"lord and master of every- thing\" since 1844,—and that was the secret purpose of its real authors. The gold standard was designed to limit the volume of currency in order to enhance the power and value of gold and its owners. The currency cannot ex-"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"92 pand beyond the quantity of gold in circulation and it therefore presents an absolute artificial limit to the expansion of currency and credit and of busi- ness, which is based thereon. As a result the currency systems based on it al- ways break down when there is an unusual demand for currency and credit created by war. All the nations of the world were compelled to abandon the gold standard during World War I, and consequently the Rothschild interest sought to restore it immediately thereafter. The conferees at the peace conference, Lloyd George, Clemenceau and Presi- dent Wilson, created two subordinate committees to work out the details of their schemes:—one called the Economic Section and the other the Financial Committee. President Wilson appointed \"Elder\" Baruch as the American rep- resentative on the Economic Section and Thos. W. Lamont, a partner of J. P. Morgan & Co., as our representative on the Financial Committee; both of them Rothschild agents. The committee of the Economic Section held its session at or about the time of the Versailles Conference but the Financial Conference was held later at Brus- sels. The Economic Section's committee fixed the German reparations at $12,000,000,000 in flagrant vi olation of the terms of surrender as proclaimed in President Wilson's fourteen points. The Brussels Financial Conference in the face of the official advice of Professor Cassel decreed that the world should retu rn to the gold standard. This neces- sarily meant that all monies, including the dollar, would be greatly enhanced in value, and prices and wages would be reduced accordingly. The dollar has in fact been enhanced from two- to three-fold, and prices and wages and values have been reduced to the same extent. It also necessarily meant that it would be impossible for Germany to pay the re parations fixed by the Economic Sec- tion, and for the Allies to pay the monies borrowed from America. Following the decision of the Financial Conference, the \"Elders\" sent Professor Kemmerer and their other lackeys to the principal countries of the world to reorganize their financial systems upon a gold basis. They even established the gold standard in poor old defenseless China that had always been on a silver basis and with a limited currency volume of only about $2.50 per capita of silver and a negligible quantity of gold, with the result that millions of Chinese perished from starvation. The victorious Allies turned Germany over to the tender mercies of the Jews. After having fixed the German reparati ons at an impossible figure under the gold standard, they drove another nail in the coffin of prostrate Germany in order to make assurance doubly sure. They not only re-established the curren-"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"93 cy of Germany upon a gold basis but they imposed upon the German people our infamous Federal Reserve System, calling it the \"Dawes Plan,\" by which they gave the Elders the power to control the volume of currency and credit and the level of prices and wages. They likewise made it impossible for our Allies, Britain, France and other countries, to repay the loans we made them. It was probably never intended that they should be repaid. Elder Baruc h is primarily responsible for them for at the time they were made he was President Wilson's right hand man and was directing his foreign policy. There is no authority in our constitution for loans or gifts to the Allies. They were made in utter and flagrant violation of law. They were made for the purpose of enabli ng foreign countries to remain on the gold standard and pay their debts to the Rothschilds. Thus, for the pretended purposes of writ ing a peace treaty that would establish permanent peace among the nations of the world and of collecting German reparations, the \"Elders\" partially established their League of Nations and their International Labor Bureau, and re -established the gold standard,—but for only a brief period. All countries have since been compelled to abandon the gold standard, but this was not done until after it had impoverished the people of the world and im- paired their morale. The people in th eir despair have overthrown their gov- ernments and created dictatorships and semi-dictatorships; nations are at war with each other; and a general war is on. This is all precisely according to the program of the Elders as set out in their protocols. Thos. W. Lamont knew that the return to the gold standard would be the ruin of all of the States that attempted it, for that result was clearly pointed out to him by the report to the Brussels Financial Conference of his specialist, Profes- sor Gustav Cassel of Sweden. He no doub t knew it apart from this report, but this report made it clear and certain. Professor Cassel was appointed to advi se the committee and he did advise them that the restoration of the gold standard would make it impossible for all of the nations of the world to pay their respective debts; that it meant bank- ruptcy and ruin for all of them. He made an unanswerable argument in sup- port of his thesis and yet Mr. Lamont and his fellow conspirators decreed that the world should pay its debts and base its values upon Rothschild owned and manipulated gold. There could be but one purpose in view and that was to destroy all of the States of the world, for that was the necessary effect and it was the known ef-"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"94 fect. Their purposes were poverty an d suffering and unrest and communism and war, for these were the necessary and known results. It was for the pur- pose of destroying all governments and establishing their Jewish world empire with their \"King-Despot of the Blood of Zion\" as emperor, for that is the plan of their protocols. The present war has now developed into a struggle for the preservation of the gold standard. In the beginning Hitler sought only the restoration of pre-war Germany, but it has now passed that stag e. It appears to be his present pur- pose to destroy the Jewish Empire which is so interwoven with the British Empire that the two apparently must go down together. The hybrid Churchill is ready to sacrifice the last Englishman to preserve the Jewish Empire;—the British empire is only an incidental consideration. With victory within his grasp Hitler proposed to negotiate a peac e on the basis of preserving the Brit- ish Empire, which Churchill rejected. It is the Jewish Empire that is of such deep concern to our hybrid President. He appears to be willing to sacrifice the youth and wealth of this nation to preserve it. It was for that purpose that he caused to be acquired and stored more than 20 billion dollars of gold; that he sent Sumner Welles on his scout- ing expedition; that Secretary Hull called the Havana conference; and that he is organizing a huge army and navy."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"XIII. WORLD WAR II \"We must be in a position to respon d to every act of opposition by war with the neighbors of that country which dares to oppose us; but if these neighbors should also venture to stand collectively to- gether against us, then we must offer resistance by a universal war.\"—From Protocol 7. The First World War deposed the Kaiser and Bethmann Holweg, but did not depose Rathnau and the other Jews; it transformed the German government from a Jew-controlled monarchy to a Je w-controlled democracy. It is true there was a different set of Jews in control of the democracy; different men, but the same old Rothschild influence, Rothschild ideals, and Rothschild pro- gram. Their first act was to debase the Germ an currency, the reichsmark. They is- sued many billions of it and continued to issue it until it had no value. They sold vast quantities of this money at heavy discounts in America and other countries, and then made it utterly worthless, thereby fleecing real money from the people of the world. They bought German properties, factories, lands, etc., on time at high prices and paid their obligations in worthless money. Af- ter all of this wild inflation and after having acquired and paid for their prop- erties with nothing, this same malign Jewish influence through the Dawes Commission brought about a reorganization of the German Reichsbank, a restoration of the gold standard, and deflation. Thus the Jews have oppressed and impove rished the people of Germany. They have had a great picnic and very rich pi cking, and they are now paying for their fun. It was estimated by Adolf Hitler that the Jews owned four-fifths of the wealth of Germany. Think of it. This al ien race comprising less than 1% of the population owned 80% of the wealth of the country. The worst of it is that they stole it by the manipulation of the German currency system—in the same way that they have stolen the wealth of our country. The wonder is that Hitler has been so patient and forbearing. President Wilson proclaimed his famous fourteen points to Germany and the world as a basis for a truce and peace.In substance they assured Germany that if she would cease hostilities that th e German people and government would not be penalized. The terms of the peace were formally accepted by the Kaiser, and accordingly an armistice was declar ed which was later followed by the Versailles treaty."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"96 When Germany had laid down her arms and was prostrate and defenseless she was turned over to the Jews to be dissected and sterilized. In a radio speech made by Adolf Hitler a few months before World War II, he recited the prom- ises that were made to induce the surre nder of the German army by President Wilson in his famous fourteen points, the flagrant breach of those promises although impliedly guaranteed by the American Government, the dismem- berment of the German Empire and the imposition of impossible penalties, and the great depth to which the Jewish Administration of the German gov- ernment following the, war had reduced the people. Of this he said: \"Jewish parasites, on one hand, plundered the nation ruthlessly, and, on the other hand, incited the people when it had been re- duced to misery. As the misfortune of our nation became the only aim and object of this race it was possible to breed among the growing army of unemployed suitable elements for Bolshevik rev- olution. \"Decay of political order and confusion of public opinion by the ir- responsible Jewish press led to ever stronger shocks to the eco- nomic life and, consequently, to increasing misery and to greater readiness to absorb subversive Bolshevik ideas. The army of Jew- ish World Revolution, as the army of unemployed was called, fi- nally rose to almost seven million.\" That is precisely what they are now doing in America, and for precisely the same purpose. That is the manner by which they gained temporary control of the Austrian government. It is their method of operation. Our people have not yet sunk to the depth of poverty and misery and despair suffered by the Ger- man people, following World War I, bu t they are rapidly approaching that condition, and even now they provide fertile soil for the seeds of communism and revolution. Hitler's speech was not one of an ambitiou s, saber-rattling braggart, but it was that of a sober, deliberate, determined man, with a mission to perform, who abhors war. He said of the war-mongers: \"If the cry of 'Never another Munich!' is raised in the world today this simply confirms the fact that a peaceful solution of the prob- lem appeared to be the most fatal thing that ever happened in the eyes of those war-mongers. They are sorry no blood was shed— not their blood of course—for these agitators are, of course, never"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"97 to be found where shots are being fired, but only where money is being made! No, it is the blood of the nameless soldiers.\" In his speech Adolf Hitler plainly and unequivocally said to Poland that Ger- many must have Danzig and the Polish Corridor, both formerly German, but he did not demand Silesia, also formerly German. He said that in the interest of World Peace he had made a treaty with France regarding Alsace, also for- merly German, and he prop osed to abide by it. Hitler undertook to negotiate a treaty with Poland by which these fractions of Germany would be restored , by agreement. Pending these negotiations there was a pogrom against the resident Germans of Poland. Despite that fact Hitler made an appointment with the Jewish Polish foreign minister Beck to con- clude the treaty, which Beck failed to keep. Instead of doing so he went to Downing Street in London for advice. Hitl er then sent an army to suppress the Polish uprising and thereupon Englan d and France declared war on Germa- ny;—thus World War II began. When war was declared the Allies sought to encircle Germany; to that end they sought to make an alliance with Sovi et Russia and the Balkan states. Pending these negotiations Germany effected an alliance with Russia, the terms of which are not clear, but it appears to be an economic alliance and not a mili- tary one. Both the Russian and German governments have been criticized for this al- liance, which appears to be a misfit. Th e Germans claim that it was a matter of self-preservation on the part of German y and that if she had not entered into an alliance with Russia the Allies would have done so,—which is probably true. The communists claim that it is entirely co nsistent with their principles, that it is to the advantage of communism to engulf the entire world in war and then administer on the wreckage,—which is al so true, and which is in keeping with their principles and program. That no doubt accounts for the fact that com- munists of all countries approve this misalliance. After conquering Poland Hitler again proposed to the Allies and to the world to make peace on the basis of restoring to Germany only that which was taken from her by the treaty of Versailles, with the exception of Alsace. The only difference in this and his original propos al was that it involved the return of the colonies which the treaty of Versai lles awarded to Great Britain. The an- swer to this overture was that they would not treat with the Hitler government; that Hitler and Hitlerism (meaning anti-Semitism) must be destroyed."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"98 True to her ancient strategy it was the policy of England to starve the enemy by blockade with her sea power. In violatio n of international law, which has been made largely by the British Empire, she imposed a blockade upon both Ger- man exports and imports. This Germany met with her submarines and air force, with the result that the starving has been \"the othe r way round.\" Britain is now getting a dose of her own medicine and it Is evidently very distasteful to her. Up to this time Germany has fought the war according to the rules of civilized warfare; she has not abused her superior power in the air by attacking with poison gas, as the British evidently expected; she has not attempted to assassi- nate any British leader; she has given shelter and transportation to the soldiers and seamen of Britain when her ships were destroyed. There were a number of these prisoners of war on the \"Altmark\" which was anchored in a Norwegian port. By order of Churchill a British cruiser, in viola- tion of the neutrality of Norway, attacked the Altmark, anchored in a Norwe- gian port, shot several of the crew who were unarmed and did not offer resis- tance, and released the prisoners. It is obvious that Germany could have left all of these prisoners to their fate when their ships were sunk. The dastardly, co- wardly, murderous attack of the Brit ish upon the defenseless Altmark was applauded by the Jewish British and Amer ican press as a great British victory. According to the Associated Press the distinguished Norwegian novelist, Knut Hamsun, addressing his countrymen, said of this banditry: \"When the Britishers in their prodigious savagery forced a pas- sage into Jossing Fjord and infringed our neutrality, you did nothing about it. But when the Germans occupied Norway to pre- vent war in our country you did something: You conspired with our runaway King and his priv ate government and mobilized. Norwegians! Throw away your rifles and return home.

It has been conclusively shown by offici al papers which fell into the hands of the Germans when they captured Oslo, as well as by other facts, that the Brit- ish through the Jew Hambro, head of the Norwegian government, had pre- viously arranged to send troops to Norway and to take charge of all of her stra- tegic ports. They appear to have been actually en route when Germany, having"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"99 a shorter distance to travel, and superi or generalship, landed her troops in Norway first. She \"beat them to the draw.\" Norway capitulated and is now under the control of Germany. The Allies were very much disturbed by this victory. The Jewish press de- manded a more vigorous prosecution of the war. Despite the fact that Lord Admiral Churchill, then head of the War Board, had been primarily responsi- ble for the Norwegian defeat, the Britis h government retire d Chamberlain, and Churchill was made Prime Minister. Chur chill re-organized the cabinet, bring- ing into it two other pro-Jews and Hitler-haters,—Anthony Eden and Duff- Cooper. They boldly announced that the Allies would take the offensive and would attack Germany; about the same time they transferred the British fleet from Scapa Flow to the Mediterranean. This meant one of two things: either that the Allies meant to attack Germany through the Balkans or that they had moved the fleet for the purpose of deceiv- ing Hitler into the belief that they would do so, while their real purpose was to attack through Holland and Belgium. If the fleet was moved for the purpose of deception the ruse was an ineffective on e and probably an unfortunate one for the Allies. Hitler was not deceived. The Germans claim that the Allies had made arrangements with the govern- ments of Holland and Belgium to make the attack through those countries, and Germany again \"beat them to the draw.\" We don't know the truth. It will likely be revealed later. The Allies have not won a single battle or diplomatic victory, with the possible exception that they bought the support of Turkey with a loan of $140,000,000 which has proven to be a barren victory. The Germans apparently have had superior equipment and they undoubtedl y have had superior generalship and morale of soldiers. The most important of these requirements is the morale and fighting spirit of the soldier. The cause and results of the present war prior to the surrender of France are graphically stated by Newton Jenkins of Chicago, as follows: \"What made Austria as an indepe ndent nation fall? Why did Cze- choslovakia lose her independence? What made Poland pass out? What caused Denmark, Norway, Holland and Belgium to cease operations as free countries? Why are England and France likely to meet the same fate? German a ggression, you say. Not at all. Organized Jewry is the answer."},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"100 by the Jews once and they know t   \"Organized Jewry made Schushnigg and others in Austria pursue a mad policy of national suicide and Germany rescued that nation from the unholy alliance.

Organized Jewry drove Negrin, Del Vayo and other leaders in Spain along their mad course until the people under Franco rescue d that nation. Organized Jewry drove Beck, Smigly Ridz and othe r leaders in Poland along the same mad course toward destruction. In Norway organized Jewry, working through the part Jewish Hambro, drove that nation along a path of pro-British sympathy and it ceased to exist as an in dependent nation.

They know this from the private to the general and by bitter experience. They are fighting for their freedom. \"Thrice armed is he whose cause is just.\" The British and French soldiers are good soldiers and brave men; it is in their blood and sinew and bone,—but they fought half-heartedly. They are begin- ning to learn, if they have not already done so, that this war is a Jew's war for Jewish power and purposes. The defeat of the Jews is now apparent . The Germans are moving with irresist- ible power toward London and they will likely reach their destination before Roosevelt will be able to inveigle America into the war. The Jews, as stated in their protocols, have met Germany's \"act of opposition by war\" but they have not been able to \"offer re sistance by a universal war.\" In the same protocol they say that they \"shall respond with the guns of America or China or Japan,\" but China and Japan are now otherwise engaged, and \"Uncle Shylock\" wants to stay out of it."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"XIV. OUR DESPOT OF THE BLOOD OF ZION \"However, it is probably all the sa me to the world who is its sove- reign lord, whether the head of Catholicism or our despot of the blood of Zion! But to us the Chosen People, it is very far from be- ing a matter of indifference.\"—From Protocol 5. The people of America do not want a su per-government or to be ruled by the pope of Rome or a \"despot of the blood of Zion.\" We barely escaped it when the republicans, with the aid of \"twelve willful\" democrats defeated the League of Nations project by a very small margin; for the League of Nations meant that very thing. The Jewish press informs us that one of the original objectives of the present war, called World War II, was the creation of the United States of Europe,—in fact Prime Minister Chamberlain stated the same purpose in one of his speeches,—but it has gotten beyond that stage. It is now a struggle to preserve the British Empire and the gold standard. The Jews have bled the British Empire white. They have exploited all of the colonies, particularly India and South Africa, but Australia, New Zealand and Canada have not escaped them. They impoverished Ireland to the extent that that country revolted. It is significant that India and Ireland have not come to the rescue of the \"mother country, England,\" in this her hour of peril, and that she has had no support from Arabia, her former ally. The Arabians have been fooled once with the promise of Palestine, and while this has been renewed in a modified form they did not fall for the bait. Nor has England had any support from the Jews of Palestine so far as we have been informed by the Jewish press. It is certain that if they had raised a corps of thirty men the press would have heralded it all over the world. The Jews prefer that the Gentiles do all of the me nial work and all of the fighting. When one of them is drafted he is usually a \"conscientious objector\" or he finds his way to the commissary department. One of the troubles with the Allies is the graft of the Jews in their Ordnance and Commissary Departments which are in Jewish hands. If we must choose between being ruled by the Pope of Rome and a \"despot of the blood of Zion,\" the Pope is preferable. He at least will let us live and will not enslave us."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"104 But there does not appear to be any ground for the implied charge in the pro- tocols that the Catholic hierarchy is actively seeking to recover its lost political power and to reestablish its temporal dominion. Undoubtedly the Pope would be delighted to see a Catholic government in America and in every other coun- try of the world. But there is no evidence known to me that the Pope is seeking to gain these ends in the clandestine, subterranean manner as set out in the protocols or that he is cooperatin g with the Elders for such ends. The Pope is now having great difficulty in maintaining the status of the church in its ancient strongholds, viz., Mexico and Czechoslovakia. It is hardly con- ceivable that under these circumstances he or the Catholic hierarchy would be actively at work undermining the gove rnments of other countries through the impoverishment of the people and th e destruction of their governments. On the contrary there is evidence that the Pope does not approve the present Jewishized administration. The most effective and boldest critic of it has been Father Coughlin of Detroit. If the press is to be believed, (and I do not swear by it), the Pope actually approved Father Coughlin's campaign against the Roosevelt-Jewish-deflation administration. The Catholic Church ruled practically all the countries of Europe for a period of more than a thousand years following the fall of the Roman Empire. It is the period known as the \"dark ages.\" The pe ople were ignorant, superstitious, and desperately poor, and the church was at no pains to enlighten them and to help them. The church has surrendered its temporal authority grudgingly and after much bloody strife. Even now it maintains the semblance of a political government at the Vatican, to which some nations send their ambassadors. Contrary to the policy and tradition of our government the President ap- pointed Myron C. Taylor, Chairman of the Board of the United States Steel Corporation, as our ambassador to the Vatican. There was a political party in most countries of Europe known as the \"Catholic Party,\" which was devoted primarily to the interests of the church. The Order of the Jesuits was formerly the political organization of the church, which ap- pears to have had a code of political morality as cynical as that of the Jewish \"Learned Elders of Zion.\" The Jesuit orga nization does not appear to be active in America. The present war is a death struggle be tween Hitlerism (anti-Semitism) and Jewish imperialism. It is not primarily for the restoration of Poland or Cze- choslovakia or any other country except insofar as such restoration contributes to Jewish imperialism. It is primarily to destroy Hitler and Germany because"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"105 they are both anti-Semitic, and to preserve the gold standard because through it the Jews control the economic destiny of all countries. Hitler abandoned the gold standard, since which date Germany has been prosperous and with no unemployment. Germany is fighting this war without gold and is thereby demonstrating to the world that it is not necessary to bor- row gold from the Jews in order to wage war. Hitler threatens the very foundations of the Jewish empire throughout the world and he now appears to seriously threaten the British navy which the Jews have used to preserve their empire. Our beloved (?) President Roosevelt is itching to get into this war to save world Jewry and to promote himself and not to save America. All of this war hysteria in the United States has been created by the Jewish press and F. D. Roosevelt to serve their fellow tribesmen and not to serve their fellow Americans. In a speech delivered before the Nation al Social Congress at Nurnberg, Ger- many, on Sept. 13, 1935, Dr. Joseph Go ebbels, Mr. Hitler's assistant, said: \"Where are the men behind the scenes of this virulent world movement? Who are the inventors of all this madness? Who transplanted this ense mble into Russia and is today making the attempt to have it prevail in other countries? The answer to these questions discloses the actual secr et of our anti-Jewish policy and our uncompromising fight against Jewry; for the Bolshevik Inter- national is in reality nothing le ss than a Jewish Internationale. \"It was the Jew who discovered Marxism. It is the Jew who for decades past has endeavored to sti r up world revolution through the medium of Marxism.. It is the Jew who is today at the head of Marxism in all the countries of the world. Only in the brain of a nomad who is without nation, race and country could this Satan- ism have been hatched. And only one possessed of a satanic male- volence could launch this revolutionary attack.\" Every word and every sentence of the above statement is true. It will bear reading a second time. It not only explains the \"actual secret\" of the anti- Jewish policy of Germany but it explains the \"actual secret\" of anti-Semitism in America and throughout the world. The Jews have in times past been expelled from every country in Europe and some of those of Asia.

They were expelled twice from France and were expelled and kept out of England for 400 years after their expulsion. Why? It was not because of the ignorance and brutality of all peoples in all ages but because the Jews have been what they are, with the same characteristics and the same ideals and purposes throughout the ages. These characteristics and ideals are reflected in their Talmud and protocols and communist code. Before any World Empire can be establishe d it is necessary first to destroy the American form of government. The plan of the protocols for that purpose is to impoverish the people, impair their morals and nullify their constitution. There can be no dictator or king or emperor so long as the people are happy and prosperous and patriotic and adhere to their established form of govern- ment. The method set out in detail in th e protocols is the only possible way to subjugate the American people to the \"Despot of the blood of Zion\" or any other despot. The destruction of our go vernment has been the principal objec- tive of the \"Jew Deal\" and the present Jewish administration."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"XV. OUR UNDECLARED WAR AGAINST GERMANY \"We have harnessed them all to the task; each one of them on his own account is boring away at the last remnants of authority, is striving to overthrow all established form of order. By these acts all States are in torture; they exhort to tranquility, are ready to sacrifice everything for peace; but we will not give them peace un- til they openly acknowledge our international Super-Government, and with submissiveness . . . And the weapons in our hands are limitless ambitions, burning gree diness, merciless vengeance, ha- treds and malice.\"—From Protocol 9. Soon after the German order of fine and expulsion of the Jews, President Roo- sevelt withdrew our Ambassador to Germany for consultation, (as announced in the press), but he is still at home. Quite a lengthy consultation. This is an act of war; it is usually the first step pr eceding a declaration of war, but Hitler refused to accept the challenge for the obvious reason that he does not want war with us, despite the fact that we are wholly unprepared. The treaty of Munich was a sad disappointment to International Jewry and to Franklin D. Roosevelt. Mr. Roosevelt showed his resentment by imposing a 25% tariff on German importations and attaching the monies of the Reich- sbank on deposit in New York banks. These were overt acts of war which Hitler has met with firmness and dignity. He could do no less than withdraw his own Ambassador and impose a like tariff upon our exports to Germany. If he de- sired war with our country he has ample grounds for it. It is probably a disap- pointment to the President that he did not accept the challenge and declare war. In his first message to the 76th Congress, the President said: \"Words may be futile, but war is not the only means of command- ing a decent respect for the opinions of mankind. There are many methods short of war, but stronge r and more effective than mere words, of bringing home to aggressor governments the aggregate sentiments of our own people.\" It is significant that no other country of the world has imposed such a tariff upon German imports. Germany can ge t along without our wheat and corn and cotton and meat and dairy exports as well as we can get along without her market for them, but both countries are being injured. This argument, howev-"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"108 er, has no force with men who are seeking to impoverish our people and to destroy our government. Apparently the President made some sort of a secret military alliance with the governments of England and France. At a secret meeting with the Senate Mili- tary Affairs Committee he is reported to have said that the \"frontiers of France are our frontiers.\" That is the traditional position of Great Britain. He denounced this report as a \"deliberate lie\" but he would not release the members of the Military Affairs Committee from their pledge of secrecy, and he suppressed an investigation. Senator Lundeen of Minnesota, who is a member of this committee and attended this conference with the President, said in a speech in the Senate that the President's statement to this committee, if revealed, would \"shock and stun\" the American people. The President pretends that he does not want war and that he is trying to avoid it. He made two dramatic appeals to Hitler to halt,—the first by radio, the second by message. In the second he proposed to act as mediator and to call a conference of the nations of the earth to enter into a ten-year truce. On the day preceding this message he denounced Hitler in a much publicized speech, as an aggressor and a disturber of world peace. This was not the way to bring about a co nference and a ten year truce. If Mr. Roosevelt really desired such conference and truce he would have submitted his offer in the usual way through diplomatic channels, and not by proclaiming it from the housetops. He desired that the offer should be rejected, and made it as offensively as he could. It was made for \"home consumption\" and to rally the people of America behind him. He does not appear to have fooled many people. Dorothy Thompson (Levy) and the other war mongers, all with one accord clapped their hands and ap- plauded—not because they thought his offer was a step in the direction of peace, but because they believed it to be a step in the direction of war. Nor did it fool Hitler and Mussolini. Mussolini's paper said of it: \"We deny the President any right to intervene in European ques- tions because his country is not di rectly interested as well as be- cause he personally has not the slightest claim to assuming the role of friendly and impartial mediator.\""},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"109 The article said President Roosevelt's appeal evidently was for internal use. It charged him with wanting to divert Am erican opinion from \"the unemploy- ment which grows day by day.\" When the Allies declared war on Germany President Roosevelt immediately got busy. His first act was to create an international commission headed by Myron Taylor, Chairman of the Board of the United States Steel Corporation, to assist in the migration of the Jews. We do not know what this commission has done or is doing, but it is still at work and we are putting up the money, and the Jews are landing here by the ship-load. No country except the United States,—not even Russia—has volunteered a home for the Jews. They have been sent to various South American countries and have been turned back. But we are sending our ships for them and their gold, and congress has recently approp riated $50,000,000 for their mainten- ance. In defiance of our immigration laws, which are entirely too lax, the President and Madam Secretary Perkins are admitting Jews, without limit, to America. It was reported that 3,000 per day are now being received without restriction, and the balance of them on a six months visit, which means permanency—at least so far as this Administration is concerned. They are evidently coming now at an even faster rate. The immigration law provides for quotas for all races and nationalities except the Jew; there is no limit as to Jews. The immigration authorities class the Jew as a religion and not a race, with the result that the great majority of the immi- grants we are now receiving from all countries are Jews. They are in fact an alien people with alien characteristics—mental, moral, and physical—which are always the same and remain the same whether they are German, Russian, Spanish, American, or what not. They don't merge in the melting pot or by intermarriage except to bequeath their Jewish characteristics to the offspring. They are as distinct in their characteristics and as undesirable as are the Japanese and Chinese, which we exclude. The Jews should be ex- cluded for we already have too many of them. America is now the haven and refuge for the Jews of the world. We have more Jews in the United States than there are in England, France, and Palestine combined. If it is true that there are on ly 15 million Jews in the world then we have about half of the Jewish population of the world for we now have within our borders between seven and eight million Jews."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"110 It is said that in the Constitutional Convention both General Washington and Benjamin Franklin opposed the admission of Jews into America. Robt. E. Ed- mondson is authority for the following quotation from the diary of Charles Pinckney of South Carolina, a member of that convention. The Jews deny the authenticity of this historical memo but that is characteristic of the Jews. It is their custom to destroy documents of this type and then deny their authentici- ty. The statement is evidence of the vision and wisdom of Washington and Franklin: \" 'I agree fully with General Washington—that we must protect this young nation from an insidious influence and impenetration. That menace, gentlemen, is the Jew. \" 'In whatever country Jews have settled in any great numbers, they have lowered its moral tone ; depreciated its commercial in- tegrity; have segregated themselves and have not been assimi- lated; have sneered at and tried to undermine the Christian reli- gion upon which that nation is founded by objecting to its restric- tions; have built up a state within a state; and when opposed have tried to strangle that country to de ath financially, as in the case of Spain and Portugal. \" 'For over 1700 years the Jews have been bewailing their sad fate in that they have been exiled fr om their homeland, as they call Pa- lestine. But, gentlemen, did the wo rld today give it to them in fee simple they would at once find so me cogent reason for not return- ing. Why? Because they are vampires, and vampires do not live on vampires. They cannot live only among themselves. They must subsist on Christians and othe r peoples not of their race. \" 'If you do not exclude them from these United States, in this Con- stitution, in less than 200 years they will have swarmed in such great numbers that they will dominate and devour the land, and change our form of government, for which we Americans have shed our blood, given our lives, our substance, and jeopardized our liberty. \" 'If you do not exclude them, in less than 200 years our descen- dants will be working in the fields to furnish them substance while they will be in the counting houses rubbing their hands. I warn you, gentlemen, if you do not excl ude the Jews for all time, your children will curse you in your graves."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"111 \" 'Jews, gentlemen, are Asiatic, let them be born where they will, or how many generations they are away from Asia they never will be otherwise.

Jews are Asiatic, are a menace to this country if permitted entrance , and should be excluded by this Constitution.' \"Pinckney is further quoted as saying: 'We were amazed at the words of Mr. Franklin, especially as there are only about 500 Jews in the country. I know Mr. Franklin may be right. In less than 200 years, if we admit them the scoundrels will be calling US their ANCESTORS'.\" Every word of the above statement is true. It is a pity they were not heeded. It is not for us to get excited about Germany's treatment of the Jews. If the German government thinks that they brought about World War I with its frightful consequences to the German people; if they believe that they are re- sponsible for the present war; if they believe the murder of Ernst von Rath was the act of International Jewry; if for these or other reasons they consider the Jews undesirable and wish to fine and expel them,—that is their affair and not ours. When World War II was declared the Americans in Europe hurried home. About 1500 of them were on the Athenia which was torpedoed and sunk in British waters. The Germans claim that they had no U-boats in that vicinity and that the ship was sunk by the British themselves for the purpose of in- fluencing our government to declare war on Germany,—which Churchill de- nies. There was no reason for Germany to sink the ship for it was en route to Ameri- ca, and it had no provisions or war supplies or soldiers on it. There was good reason, however, for the British to sink it because of the American passengers on it—which was the casus helium of our entry into World War I. We cannot accept Mr. Churchill's statemen ts at par. He is the Jewish-type of politician that only says and does those things that will promote his own pur- poses. In fact he has publicly stated, boastfully, that he only gives out such information as he thinks it is good for the public to know,—of which he is the exclusive judge."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"112 President Roosevelt sent his envoy, Sumner Welles, abroad for the pretended purpose of sounding out the warring countries and the Pope of Rome on the subject of peace.

The real purpose was to effect a truce until we were better prepared for war. More recently still the President, accord ing to press reports, appealed to Mus- solini not to enter the war. We do not know what he said to Mussolini and what Mussolini said in reply further than that he made a courteous reply. It may be that his last note to Mussolini contained a threat in accordance with suggestions of the British press,—that th e United States would enter the war if Italy did so. We do not know the truth. We do know, however, that Mr. Roosevelt is med- dling in European affairs to the full extent of his ability, and that he is render- ing every possible aid to Britain and is feverishly preparing to join her in the present war. We know furthermore that Germany is not now threatening us with war and has never done so. Germany has not searched our mails or impounded our ships as have the British.

PLAN OF MOBILIZATION \"It is only with a despotic ruler that plans can be elaborated ex- tensively and clearly in such a way as to distribute the whole properly among the several parts of the machinery of the State; from this the conclusion is inevitable that a satisfactory form of government for any country is one that concentrates in the hands of one responsible person. Without an absolute despotism there can be no existence for civilization which is carried on not by the masses but by their guide, whosoever that person may be.\"—From Protocol 2. We are now preparing for war on a gigant ic scale. With an admitted national debt of $45,000,000,000, with the taxpayers taxed to the point that industry is no longer attractive, and with poverty and distress stalking throughout the land, Congress has authorized about 17 billions of dollars for war purposes. In a speech in the United States Senate on March 6, 1939 (see Congressional Record of that date, page 3224), Senator Lynn Frazier of North Dakota said: \"No one can make me believe that all these war preparations are for defense. In my opinion they are preparations for war, and a foreign war at that. Does anyone know what nations are expected to attack us? Does anyone know who is going to invade our shores? Surely all the great nation s of the world have their hands full at home at the present time, and there is no imminent danger of any attacks upon the United States . . . \"We have recently heard about secret conferences and secret ses- sions here at home. The question naturally arises, Are we our- selves already involved in foreig n entanglements and secret trea- ties? Who knows? If there is anyone who knows, he will not tell, because we have been unable to find out what these secret agree- ments are, if any, and whet her or not we have any.\" Surely the members of the United States Senate should be advised of \"foreign entanglements\" and \"secret treaties.\" The Constitution provides that they must be ratified by the senate. If the President made such commitments he has al- ready assumed the powers of a dictator."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"114 Upon conclusion of the military compact between England and France, Eng- land's King and Queen visited the President of France, which visit he later returned. Magnificent recept ions of mediaeval splendor were held in both England and France. The King and Queen then came to America, visited Pres- ident Roosevelt at the White House and also at his Hyde Park residence. These visits, both to Paris and Washington, were evidently arranged by the Jewish administrations of the three countries to effect the triple alliance they were attempting to make in preparation for the war. It is likely that President Roosevelt is responsible for the Russian invasion of Finland. Soviet Russia sought in advanc e to obtain from Finland by negotia- tion, the territory that was taken from Russia by the Treaty of Versailles. This failed upon the advice of the Allies and upon their promises to help Finland in case of war. They no doubt made these promises believing that if Finland was attacked that the United States would come to her aid because Finland alone of all European countries had recognized her obligation to the United States to repay the moneys loaned her. They no doubt made them on assurances that had previously been given by the President. Although deeply sympathizing with Finl and, the people of America were not willing to go to war in her behalf. \"Unc le Shylock\" has become \"gun shy;\" he has been worked once too often. If it is true that Finland was made a sacrifice to get us into the war, as appears to be the case, then she is another \"Athenia\" and another victim of Britis h diplomacy and duplicity. Senator Frazier said further, in the speech mentioned: \"There is agitation for the passag e of the so-called industrial mo- bilization bill. According to my information, the bill has not been introduced at this session of the Congress, but it was introduced at the last session, and a great deal was said about it. It was mod- ified somewhat at the last session, and still there is much agitation about it . . . \"This industrial mobilization bill was introduced in the last Con- gress—it was an administration measure—so that in the event of war the President of the United States would be given the power to draft about 4,000,000 youn g men for war purposes.\" This mobilization plan was gotten up about five years ago by the Secretary of War and the Secretary of the Navy, which indicates that they have been con- templating war for at least that length of time.

The President is given absolute dictatorial power to conscript the people of America and all of their possessions, which means that this power will be exercised by the bunch of Jews that are now in control of the exec utive department of our government. It means that our constitutional form of government has been discarded,—not temporarily but permanently. Barney Baruch or some other Jew will be Chairman of the War Industries Board, and he will not relinquish this post when the war terminates; nor will our President relinquish any of his wa r powers. There will be no more elec- tions. It will be goodbye to our constitutional form of government, to our state governments, and to our freedom. It was stated in the press that Bernard Baruch had lunch with the President and had a conference with him regarding the war situation. Baruch was non- committal after this conference as to whether or not they had discussed the subject of his being appointed chairman of a War Industries Board soon to be created. It is likely that he wants the job and that he will get it in due time. It is a matter of some surprise to ha ve my conclusions fully confirmed by no less an authority than General Hugh Johnson, the President's former adminis- trator of the N. R. A., and Baruch's form er associate. He knows both Roosevelt and Baruch intimately, and his words are entitled to great weight. In a syndi- cated article in the press of April 18, 1939, he said: \"Freedom of speech and press, the right of assembly and petition and practically every guaranty of the bill of rights would go down automatically . . . \"If war comes soon, the Administration which has advocated these trends, if not these objects, woul d be continued another term, be-"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"117 cause of war. Having attained these objects because of war, how many of them would be relinqui shed at the coming of peace? \"Woodrow Wilson gave up most of his war powers immediately after the Armistice—because he detested them. Would the present Administration give them up, having greatly desired them? Has it ever willingly given up a single extraordinary emergency power since March 4, 1933? It would gi ve up nothing of power . . . \"No matter who wins, the next world war will pe rmanently de- stroy the democracy of every nation that gets into it. If we want to save democracy for the world, we will keep out of European war.\" This is the key that explains the Jew deal, the Roosevelt deflation, and every act of the Roosevelt Administration. Mr. Roosevelt has been \"On Our Way\" up to now, but when war is declared he will have reached his destination. Con- gress and the State governments will then be cast aside and our dictators will be handed down to us instead of elected. Whether our sympathy is with the British or not, we must recognize that the probabilities are that the President will drag us into the war unless Germany wins a quick victory. Even if we escape this war there is cocky little Japan, ready and willing to fight us at any time we want to fight. The Jews are saying that such a war is inevitable. There will undoubtedly be plenty of provocation for it, and if Mr. Roosevelt gets his third term we will soon be up to our necks in war. All of these elaborate preparations me an war, and war means that Roosevelt will be dictator with Baruch and Morgen thau as his assistants. It means the destruction of our republican form of go vernment and the loss of our liberties. Indeed, it must be admitted that our own morale is at the lowest ebb in our history. Hunger stalks throughout the land, and hunger has no patriotism; the farmer and the laborer have been corrupted by gratuities; the rich are noto- rious cowards, and the poor are discouraged and beaten. These are the logical and intended consequences of the \"Jew Deal.\" By act of congress the State Militia (396,000 men) have been drafted into the United States Army. The act requires that they undergo one year of military training, and it authorizes the President to impress them into service at any place in the western hemisphere. These patriotic men enlisted into the State Militia for service in their respective states, and congress is without legal au- thority to force them into the United States Army in time of peace."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"118 me and many thousa   ballot. To take a poll of our 131,00 eral weeks ti At this time (August 17, 1940) President Roosevelt, the Rothschild- power, and the Jewish press are endeavoring to drive through congress a conscription bill known as the Burke-Wadsworth bill. This measure appears to have been writ- ten by one Grenville Clark of the law firm of Root, Clark, Buckner & Ballen- tine,—Morgan attorneys, and to have been inspired by the Jew, Julius Ochs Adler, general manager of the New York Times. It appears that on May 23, 1940 the sa id Morgan attorneys and Henry L. Stim- som (our present Secretary of War and then attorney for Kuhn, Loeb & Co.), Julius Ochs Adler and others held a co nference at the Harvard Club in New York City and organized a drive for conscription. \"On the 3rd day of June they met again. They met to raise money . . . A quarter of a million dollars was raised at one time. Think of that—men raising a quarter of a million dollars to conscript boys in America.\" 34 The Record does not show who put up the quarter of a million dollars but it is a safe guess that a substantial part of it was subscribed by the Rothschilds' banks of Morgan & Co., and Kuhn, Loeb & Co. What for? What did they expect to buy with it? Not propaganda, for the Jew press are for conscription and no money was needed to obtain that support. Five thousand dollars would have been more than enough to have covered all legitimate expenses of presenting the bill and the arguments in support of it, to congress. Another $10,000 should have been ample to have paid for the telegrams that they showered upon congressmen. This $15,000 ought to have covered also the taking of the Gallup poll. This poll showed that 67% of the American pe ople favored conscription,—which is simply preposterous. One of two things is true: either no poll was taken except of the few employees constituting the so-called \"Institute of Public Opinion,\" or else the poll was confined to the Jews. This Gallup poll is one of the greatest hoaxes that the Jew press has perpe- trated upon the American people. It is usually given front page publicity in the \"Jewspapers.\" A poll is taken upon every su bject that is of current interest to the public. Nobody knows anything about the voting until the result is an- nounced. Nobody ever received a ballot or heard of anybody who received a 0,000 American people would require sev- nd dollars. Apparently these Gallup polls are 34 From Speech of Senator Holt, Con gressional Record, Aug. 6, 194 0, p. 15167."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"119 taken in 30 minutes time with an expense of less than 30 cents, and the result announced is always as the Jew press desire it to be. My estimate of $15,000 to cover the legi timate expenses of the conscription drive, plus the Gallup poll, may be a trifle conservative but surely they would not exceed $25,000, which leaves $225 ,000, for other purposes. What are those purposes? The corrupt purpose of these conspirators is obvious. I do not know whether they could or did buy any congressional supports hope not. I do not care to comment on the subject further than to say that it is a horrible thing to sell the liberties of 12,000,000 men for $225,000. It is as cheap and as detestable as the betrayal of Christ for thirty pieces of silver; and the money appears to have been furnished in both instances by the Jews. This amazing revelation was scarcely discussed by the senators. Perhaps they were shocked speechless. It has not yet been denied, despite the fact that our present Secretary of War was one of the conspirators. Senator Minton of Indi- ana defended the meeting and made a vicious personal attack on Senator Holt. Minton appears to have been supported by Barkley of Kentucky, Pepper of Florida, and Lee of Oklahoma. And thus the matter rests. The original conscription bill as written by Mr. Clark called for the registration of all men between the ages of 18 and 65, estimated at 42,000,000 men. From this vast number the President was authorized to immediately impress into training and service 4,000,000 men. The measure was materially modified by the Senate Military Affairs Commit- tee who fixed the age limit at 21 to 31, and the estimated number of men at 12,000,000, all of whom are subject to draft for training and service for a pe- riod of ten years. The measure contempl ates training 1,000,000 men a year, at an estimated cost of $1,000,000,000.00 per annum for each 1,000,000 men. We have never had conscription in this country except during brief war pe- riods. All of the requirements for the army and navy in peace-time have been filled by voluntary enlistment. Conscription will never be necessary to repel invasion. It is not necessary now, nor is it legal now. Canada did not resort to conscription for the first twelve months of the present war. Her very recent conscr iption measure limits the period of enlistment and training to thirty days instead of twelve months, and Canada is now at war with Germany and we presumptively are not."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"120   Senator Norris, who heretofore has been a consistent supporter of the New Deal, says this of the conscription bill; \"It will bring about a radical chan ge in the historic course we have taken since the birth of our Nation.

I can see no escape from it. If we are to have compulsory military training in time of peace, we shall put our- selves on a level with the dictator nations of the world.\" 35 It is reassuring that so trusting a su pporter of the New-Deal as Senator Norris has heretofore been, has finally caught th e drift of it. It is precisely for that reason—a dictatorship—that Henry L. Stimson, Frank Knox, Kuhn, Loeb & Co., Morgan & Co., and Julius Ochs Adler are spending their money for con- scription. It is for that reason that the President of the United States has endorsed this bill and in employing the full power of his high office to put it over. 35 Congressional Record, Aug. 12, 1940, p. 15535."},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"PART II.

There are certain unerring guides to a man's character, viz.: his associates and his work, \"the way we do things.\" Genera lly speaking, a man is no better than the people he chooses for his companions, (\"birds of a feather flock together,\") and he should always be judged by what he does. None of us can be judged by our pretensions and our professions, and this is particularly true of politicians. This chapter will discuss briefly the President and his pals; his work will be discussed in greater detail in later chapters. I do not personally know the Pres- ident and his intimate associates, but the late Huey P. Long knew them well and intimately. His judgment of men and his estimate of them can be accepted with confidence, for he was fearless and honest, and capable in his appraise- ments. He was originally a strong Roosev elt man and he is said to have contri- buted more than any other one man to Roosevelt's first nomination;—indeed, such nomination appears to have been due largely to Mr. Long's support and effort. He often referred to this achiev ement as one of his greatest mistakes, regretfully saying that he swallowed Mr. Roosevelt with his blarney,—\"hook, line and sinker.\" He said of the President and his administration that it was but a continuation of the Hoover deflation administration under another name and in a slightly different form; that the difference between them was the difference between \"tweedledum and tweedledee\" and \"low cockalorum and high cockalorum.\" He stated in an interview that was published throughout the country that Presi- dent Roosevelt is a \"liar and a four flus her\" and he challenged an investigation by the United States Senate,—and no one accepted the challenge."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"124 The \"kitchen cabinet\" is composed of the men behind the scene who actually run the government. The Roosevelt administration up to this hour has been directed by his \"kitchen cabinet. No im portant step has been taken, no impor- tant appointment made, no important speech delivered, that has not first had the approval of one or more members of his \"kitchen cabinet.\" They are here stated with their background, in the or der of their apparent importance, as follows: Barney Baruch, Jew; New York stock gambler; Felix Frankfurter, Jew; New York; Judge U. S. Supreme Court; Henry Morgenthau, Jew; New York; Secretary of U. S. Treasury; Sam Roseman, Jew; New York judge; Roosevelt biographer; Ben Cohen, Jew; New York attorney; Harry L.

It was reported that when Roosevelt was first elected Baruch planned to occupy one of the executive offices, but was advised against it; he had, however, just as we ll be there. Senator Long has furnished us a striking description of him and his methods: \"There is such a thing as a bird flying when he sees you are going to shoot at him. We boys used to go out in the woods and try to get another kind of bird that does :not wait for you to get ready to get a shot at him, but flies before you ever get a gun in your hand. I remember one time when I tried to shoot an old crow that I saw. I was riding along in a buggy and saw the crow on top of an old log off in the field, so I just rode up right behind a thicket so the crow could not see me at all, and reached into my buggy to get the gun to shoot, the crow. Thick as that thicket was, the minute my right hand got back near the gun the old crow flew away. (Laughter.) The minute Brother Barney Baruch saw this thing squiggling he \"got his\" and got out, and appear ed before the committee and, oh, he was a good man, and we have not seen him since. (Laughter.) He stood with the Hoover Administ ration until it was wrecked, in- side and out. Mr. Hoover was flattened out worse than a pancake, and took his crusade over to Palo Alto, Calif., where, under the shade of the umbrellas, and cooled by the breezes wafted by the palms, he could sit and watch the wreckage, as old Nero watched the burning of Rome,—but old Brother Baruch came right on back down to the White House and got hold of another President. \"We have Presidents and Presidents, but Baruch goes on forever; and"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"125 his clique, Baruch and Morgan, ha ve managed to see to it that, notwithstanding the prerogatives and rights that have been granted to them, none have been granted to the two or three mil- lion soldiers who saved their hides.\"—Congressional Record, 75th Congress, p. 7592. Elder Baruch was chairman of the War Industries Board during the period of World War I, and as such enjoyed the power and the delights and perquisites of being our Industrial Dictator. This ri ch, slick, wily and ambitious Jew stock- gambler aspires to again be our dictator, with political as well as economic power. He could now be Secretary of th e Treasury, according to a press report, but he prefers to let Elder Morgenthau hold that job, and to bide his time for a bigger one. There is reason to believe that he is the political agent of the Roth- schilds. Morgenthau holds the most powerful and important position in the cabinet, viz: Secretary of the Treasury. There is the foreign Viennese Jew, Felix Frank- furter, appointed Justice of the U. S. Supreme Court by Roosevelt. General Hugh Johnson said of him that he is \"the most powerful single individual in the United States.\" He estimated that Frankfurter is \"responsible for the ap- pointment of 125 men to key position in the government.\" The Jew Ben Cohen is one of his nominees. He actually writ es the reform bills that are designated as \"Administration measures\" and that are tendered to Congress with presi- dential endorsement and usually adopted without material changes. The President is himself of Jewish extraction. He admits it. It is immaterial whether he is one-fourth or one-half Jew, for the taint of blood is like the \"lea- ven that leaveneth the whole lump.\" It is a biological fact that the hybrid inhe- rits the characteristics of both breeds,—and Mr. Roosevelt is no exception to that rule. The mule provides a striking example of the truth of this law of nature. There was never a mule that did not have the long ears and general appearance of the jack. It is said of the mule that he is wi thout \"pride of ancestry or hope of post- erity.\" It is impossible to reproduce a race horse from a combination of a scrub with a thoroughbred. We indulgent Americans do not appreciate the importance of preserving the purity of our race. We think and speak indulgently of the \"melting pot\" but to the extent we melt and merge with inferior races we deteriorate. No one can imagine that a mulatto or a hybrid China- man would make a good ruler. It is not in the blood and it is impossible. We instinctively regard the mulatto as a Negro, no matter how white he may be in appearance. The hybrid Jew is like-"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"126 aracteristics:—his b   wise a Jew and should be so regarded. A celebrated authority says on that sub- ject: \"Only one of (the great questions of the times) is of causal impor- tance, that is, the question of the racial preservation of the natio- nality. In the blood alone there rests the strength as well as the weakness of man. As long as the people do not recognize and pay attention to the importance of th eir racial foundation, they re- semble people who would like to teach the greyhound's qualities to poodles, without realizing that the greyhound's speed and the poodle's docility are qualities wh ich are not taught, but are pecu- liar to the race . . . He who wants to redeem the people from the qualities and the vices which are alien to its original nature will have to redeem it first from the alien originators of these expres- sions. Without the clearest recogn ition of the race problem and, with it, of the Jewish question, ther e will be no rise of the German nation.\" 36 Mr. Hitler has resurrected the German nation upon that firm foundation. Even more than that he has redeemed practi cally all of Europe. He has created a new order that may become world-wide. His achievements would have been impossible upon the basis of Jew govern ment and Jew finance such as we now have. The Jews and Communists seek to destroy this purity of blood. They preach and practice racial equality. There is never a children's movie that does not have one or more Negro pickaninnies in it. Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt is one of the leaders of the racial equality movement. She has had her picture taken with Negroes, entertains them in her home, and preaches Negro equality. It was stated in the press that the President is the direct descendant of a Hol- land Jewish family named Rosenvelt. The President was, of course, not called upon to notice this slander, but he took the opportunity to do so. He said in substance, \"What of it? The Jews are as good as anybody else.\" It is unusual for a Gentile to admit Jewish blood. There was no reason for him to do so unless the charge was true. This taint of blood explains the President's Jewish companionships and Jewishized Administration. It explains many of his Jewish ch luff an d his blarney, his \"four-flushing\" and 36 \"'Mein Kampf,\" p. 469."},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"127 ictatorship. In view of the disclosures   who are seeking to overthrow our d his duplicity, and his religious adherenc e to the program of the \"Learned Eld- ers of Zion.\" The more important and unanswered question is whether or not he is, in fact, a communist. It will be recalled that Dr. Wirt, a reputable educator, published an interview in which he stated that by invitation he attended a secret meeting of the \"brain trusters\" in which the subject of \"paving the way for a Communist Dictator\" was freely and frankly discussed. This caused a great \"tempest in a teapot.\" The President was at the time on a fishing excursion in Southern seas on the private yacht, Normahal, with his friend Vincent Astor. He was met at the railroad station on his return by prac- tically all of the democratic congressmen as a testimonial of their faith in him. He made them one of his characteristic speeches in which he chided them with going from \"Wirt to Wirt\" in his absence. They appointed a Congressional Committee of Investigation, composed of the President's friends, who sum- moned before them several of the members of this meeting. They, of course, denied everything, the committee reported there was nothing to the charges, and the subject was laughed off. But it now appears from the report of the Dies Committee that there are more than 700 federal employees holding key posi- tions who are members of a \"communist front\" organization, viz: the League for Peace and Democracy. In a recent speech* Congressman Martin Dies, Chairman of the Dies Commit- tee, said of this pretentious League: \"Conceived in Moscow, delivered in Amsterdam, nourished in its infancy in America by the famous French Communist, Henri Bar- busse, the American League for Peace and Democracy has from its beginning served the interests of the Soviet Government. It has been the chief \"transmission belt\" for drawing \"innocents\" into the united front network of the Communist Party. It has fostered sa- botage in our basic and war industr ies. It was intended to serve as a reserve force for the espionage activities of spies of the Soviet Government in the United States.\" 37 And so the brain-trusters, or a consid erable number of them, are communists government and to establish in place of it a of this report, the verdict of the Con- 37 Congressional Recor d, Oct. 31, 1939."},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"128 gressional Committee exonerating these communist office-holders should be reexamined. The testimony before that committee was uncontradicted that they did have a meeting and that Dr. Wirt was invited to this meeting and attended it. It was also uncontradicted that they did discuss the subject of dictatorship. The prin- cipal difference between Dr. Wirt's testimony and that of the other partici- pants in the meeting who testified was th at Dr. Wirt testified that they said that Roosevelt was the \"Kerensky\" who would pave the way for a real dicta- tor—a Stalin—which they denied. In view of the fact that it is a part of the code of the communists to lie and deceive, (as was found by the Dies Committee) we should accept Dr. Wirt's testimony as true. Despite the revelations of the Dies Committee we still have at least 680 com- munists in Washington on the government payroll who are \"boring from with- in\" and seeking the destruction of our government, and paving the way for a dictator. By a word President Roosevelt could have them all removed from office, but he has not spoken that word. Why does he tolerate these traitors and their nefarious work? There is and can be but one answer and that is that he is in sympathy with what they are doing. They are there to take over when the occasion arises. This throws some light upon the efforts of the President and his wife to suppress and discre dit the work of this committee. Mrs. Roosevelt is also a very decided \"pin k\" or a red. She withdrew from the D. A. R. because one of its chapters refused the use of its hall to a Negro singer. She made a speech at the convention of one of the communist \"front\" organi- zations in Birmingham advocating Negro equality and the repeal of the Jim Crow law. She also defended the Jewish race in the Dec. 31, 1938, issue of \"Li- berty Magazine,\" arguing that the Jews are smarter than the Gentiles and that the Gentiles are envious of them and persecutes them for that reason. Mrs. Roosevelt appeared before the Dies Committee with communist leaders who were summoned as witnesses by the committee and were there for the purpose of giving testimony. This unusual procedure on the part of the \"First Lady\" was for one of two purposes: either to show her disapproval of the ac- tion of the committee and to intimidate them, or else to give the communists the benefit of her sympathy and support, and to encourage them. Mrs. Roosevelt's maiden name was also Roosevelt, she is the President's cou- sin as well as his wife, and has the same Jewish blood in her veins. At a recent convention of the National Youth Congress, composed of communists of all ages from youths in their teens to aged men and women, she appeared on the stage with them and entertained many of them as guests at the White House."},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"129 The President has been a politician all of the years of his life and has had Jew- ish support during that entire period of time.

The aris- tocracy, which enjoyed by law th e labor of the workers, was in- terested in seeing that the workers were well fed, healthy and strong. We are interested in just the opposite—in the diminution, the killing out of the Goyim.\"—From Protocol 3. There can be no understanding of Communism and Bolshevism without an understanding of the Jewish question, for they emanate from the Jew as truly as does our banking and currency syste m. Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, the founders of Communism, were both Jews. Communism is an essential part of the program of the \"Elders\" for the conquest of the world; just as essential as gold. They employ their banking and cu rrency system to create poverty and unrest, and communism to wreck and destroy. This explains the riddle of the Lamont family. Thos. W. Lamont, a partner of J. P. Morgan & Co., was our representative to the Brussels financial conference that sought to establish the gold standard throughout the world. His son, Cor- liss Lamont, is an active communist. Both father and son are working for a dictatorship; the father laid the foundation for it, and the son carries on the active work. I do not mean to imply that all communists are Jews or that all Jews are com- munists, but I do mean to say that the communist leaders are Jews and the Jew leaders communists. How otherwise can we explain the financing of Lenin and Trotsky by Schiff and Warburg? How otherwise can we explain the \"Jew deal\" which was concocted by Baruch, Frankfurter, et al., and put over by Roo- sevelt? Take the Jews and Jew money out of the communist party and you take out its living, propelling force; it would die overnight. The active campaign to communize America began immediately following the treaty of recognition of Russia. This treaty provided, according to press re- ports, which may or may not be true, that the Soviets would not attempt to sovietize America, but that meant nothing to them. It is one of their boasted, cardinal principles, that the end sanctifies the means, and that they may lie, steal and murder to accomplish their en ds. Prior thereto our government and"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"132 most of the governments of the world refused to recognize the Russian gov- ernment because it supports the Third Internationale, a political organization for the propagation of communism. It is this organization which is financing the communist movement in this country, which means that the Russian gov- ernment is doing so. This infamous treaty was concluded between two Jewish communists, viz., Franklin D. Roosevelt and Maxim Litvinoff (Finkelstein), for the pretended purpose of trade but for the real purpose of undermining and destroying our republican form of govern ment. It has not materially increased trade, but it has enormously increased communism and crime. Maxim Litvinoff is an avowed, full-blooded Jew, and a red communist; Roosevelt is a hybrid and a pink communist; the difference between them being only one of degree. Mr. Roosevelt has recently made some important changes in his cabinet. He fired ex-Governor Woodring as Secretar y of War because he was opposed to selling our army and navy war equipment to England, and was opposed to our declaring war against Germany. He appo inted in his place, Henry L. Stimson of New York, for the reason that he favo rs our intervention in the war and our rendering every possible aid to England. He also appointed Col. Frank Knox of Illinois as Secretary of the Navy, for the same reason. The following is Roosevelt's present cabinet, with their Jewish hook-up: Secretary of State: Cordell Hull, Tennessee; wife, Rosie Mix, J ewess; Secretary of the Treasury: Henr y Morgenthau, New York, Jew; Secretary of War: Henry L. Stimson, New York, attorney for Kuhn , Loeb & Co. (Rothschild Bank) ; Secretary of the Navy: Frank Knox, Chicago; publisher Daily New s (Roth‐ schild paper); Secretary of the Interior: Harold F.

What chance is there for us to keep out of the war with these Jews, Jew-in- laws and pro-Jews in charge of our government? The cards are stacked against us. It is not the people of England that they are seeking to rescue, but it is the Jews of Europe. It is not the British Empire they are trying to save, but it is the Jewish Empire they are seeking to preserve and promote. All of this war hyste- ria, war expenditure, and war taxes are primarily for that purpose. It is reported that there are 18,000 Jews and many thousand communists holding government positions in Washington. It is not yet quite as bad as it was in Russia before the purge, where it said that 76% of the Jewish popula- tion held government jobs. The most outrageous of all the President's ap- pointments was that of the Jew-Communist, Felix Frankfurter, to the Supreme bench. Frankfurter is the reputed author of the N. R. A. and other new deal legislation, and will, of course, as a judge, sustain their validity. Worse than that, he is an active \"Elder\" and an ac tive member of the \"American Civil Li- berties Union,\" a communist organization whose object is to impair and de- stroy our government. The United Mine Workers make the following report as to the purposes of the \"American Civil Liberties Union\": \"Active among the 'intellectual' cl asses of the country, and posing as a champion of the 'liberties of speech, press, and assembly,' is the American Civil Liberties Union at New York.

Roger Baldwin, the national director of this \"Liberties Union,\" testified that it advocated the overthrow of our govern ment \"by force and violence,\" and \"murder and assassination.\" It appears also from this evidence that both Felix Frankfurter and Harold Ickes are members of it. It also appears that it is allied with and supports the \"International La bor Defense Organization\" which is the legal department of the Communist Party.

In its report filed Jan. 3, 1940, the Di es Committee reports the following find- ings: \"According to one of the recent minutes of the Washington, D. C, branch of the American League, it was decided to 'set up League committees in the units of Government agencies with our present membership in those agencies as a nucleus.' These nuclei of the League are now formed in more than a score of Government agencies. H. C. Lamberton, chairman of the \"Washington branch of the League, testified under oath before the committee that there are 700 Government employees who are members of the Ameri- can League for Peace and Democracy.\"* The committee further reports: \"American League for Peace and Democracy.—The committee finds on the basis of overwhelming and conclusive evidence that the American League for Peace and Democracy is a Communist \"front\" organization . . . \"These self-styled Social Democrats pledged themselves to work for civil war in their respective countries in the event of another international conflict.\" 39 39 Report 1476, House Representatives, 76th Congress, 3rd Session."},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"135 The committee further reports that this organization (American League for Peace and Democracy) is financed by the Communist Party. Thus it appears that this is a militant organization, not for peace but for war; that its real pur- pose is to promote a revolution to overthrow our government when we become entangled in war, which means that if Mr. Roosevelt inveigles us into World War II that this organization will then get actively to work to overthrow our government. \"There are 700 Government employees . . . in more than a score of Govern- ment agencies\" who are set and ready to go when the occasion arises and the command is given. If Mr. Roosevelt did not know that these employees were communists and revolutionaries when they were appointed, he knows it now because this official report is available to him and his interest in the subject is such that he has undoubtedly read it. The President has clandestinely subjected us to the jurisdiction of the \"World Court,\" correctly called \"the back door to the League of Nations,\" despite our refusal to join either the League or the Court. By proclamation issued August 24, 1924, the President accepted membership in the International Labor Or- ganization on behalf of the United States. This organization is a creature of the League of Nations, composed exclusively of members of the League. One of its purposes is to standardize the hours and wages of labor throughout the world, and its decisions are subject to review only by the world court and not by our Supreme Court.* It can hardly be called a coincidence that John L. Lewis now seeks to carry out in America the man- dates of the I. L. O. The President is now employing the full power of his office to communize the labor organizations of America. He called the officials of the A. F. L. and the C. I. 0. in conference at the White House and told them in substance to get to- gether or else he would find means of forcing them to do so. So far the A. F. L. has bravely refused to yield to this pressure. Jno. P. Frey, a member of this conference, stated in the press that the terms of union offered the A. F. L, by the C. I. O. are precisely those proposed by the communists two years ago. This is what the Special Committee of Investigation of the United Mine Work- ers of America said of the program of the Communists: \"The major points in this revolutionary program of the Commun- ists are:"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"136 The evidence before the co leadership of some 10 or 1   (1) Overthrow and destruction of the Federal, state, and provin- cial governments, with the elimination of ex isting constitutional forms and foundations.

(3) Destruction of all social, econom ic, and political institutions as they exist at this time. (4) Seizure of all labor unions through a process of \"boring from within' them, and utilizing them as a strategic instrument in ful- fillment of their revolutionary de signs upon organized and consti- tutional government.\" 40 \"The revolutionary leaders in America are making a nation-wide attempt to obtain control of the American Federation of Labor, reorganize the craft unions on the basis of 'one big union' in an industry, and weld them into th e central revolutionary agency in America.\" (Senate Document No. 14, 68th Congress, pages 2 and 6.) During this long and much publicized controversy between John L. Lewis and Wm. Green, we have heard a great deal about \"one big union\" and \"crafts un- ion\"—Lewis' organization being a \"one big union\" organization and Green's a \"crafts union.\" That is now, and has been from the beginning, the fundamental difference between them. But we did not know that the \"one big union\" is a communist scheme for sabotaging American institutions and the American government. This report of the United Mine Workers is cited with approval by the Dies Committee. The Dies report mentioned says this of the C. I. O. \"With the formation of the C.

In order to bring this about it is necessary to communize the A. F. L., which he has in the past vainly tried to do. He promoted the C. I. O. as a rival organization, but since it has been unable to absorb the A. F. L., the next best thing is to amalgamate the two, and through \"boring from with- in\" to finally communize organized labor. Is not that also the purpose of the President of the United States? If that is not his purpose then why has he sought to bring about a coalition between two rival labor organizations, not once bu t repeatedly and persistently? The an- swer and the only answer is that it is the program of the protocols, of the Third Internationale, and of the Communist party. They seek to create one huge labor organization and to gain control of it, and through it to overthrow our government. Ezra Chase, a communist organizer, testified before the Dies Committee that the Communistic plan for subjugating America was to bring about a general strike in case of war, and thereby to bring about revolution. And who will be our dictator? Who now, and for the past seven years has been working feverishly to obtain the powers of a dictator? Who has bankrupted our national government and the people of America in order to bring about revolu- tion and dictatorship? None other than the man who arose from a bad dream in the middle of the night to inform the American people that he was not suited for the job of dictator,—when nobody had accused him of it.

REPORT OF THE DIES COMMITTEE \"Who and what is in a position to overthrow an invisible force? And this is precisely what our force is. Gentile masonry, blindly serves as a screen for us and our objects, but the plan of action of our force, even its very abiding-place, remains for the whole people an unknown mystery.\"From Protocol 4. The House of Representatives appointed a committee to investigate \"Un- American activities,\" known as the Dies Committee. This committee is com- posed of the following members, viz: Martin Dies, Chairman, (Texas) ; Joe Starnes (Alabama) ; John J. Dempsey (New Mexico) ; Jerry Voorhis (California) ; Jas. E. Casey (Massachusetts) ; N. M. Mason (Illinois) ; and J. Parnell Thomas (New Jersey). The first four named are Democrats and the latter three Republicans, but the committee nevertheless filed a unanimous report. The committee started out by investigating Nazi activities. It appears from their report that there is a \"German American Bund\" that has some connection with the German government. It states that Fritz Kuhn places the membership at 20,000 to 25,000, but that the Depart ment of Justice estimated it at 6500 in 1937. There is also an \"American Italian Black Shirt Legion,\" about 10,000 strong. While the committee finds that the German Bund \"must be classified as an agent of a foreign government\" there was no evidence or finding to the effect that it is seeking the overthrow of our government. On the other hand, the purpose of the German Bund appears to be to develop loyalty to both their fatherland and their adopted country. So long as the committee confined its investigation to Nazi activities every- thing was fine and lovely, but when it turned to the Communist what a howl went up from the Jewish press and leaders—led by Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harold Ickes, and Madam Perkins. In the beginning it was,"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"140 \"O noble judge! O excellent young man! O wise and upright judge! How much more elder art thou than thy looks! \"Ay, his breast: So says the bond:—doth it not, noble judge?— 'Nearest his heart:' those are the very words.\" But when the committee began to examine the record of the Communists, the President, from his high office, denounced and belittled them; something un- precedented in American history. Why? An swer that to your satisfaction if you still believe in the sincerity of Franklin D. Roosevelt. There is but one answer and that is that the President wanted to suppress the investigation of the Communists and to disparage the report of the committee. Why should he want to do that? No answer except that he is a Communist and he does not want the truth revealed. He wants the Communists to succeed in their secret, nefarious work. Whatever else may be said of Mr. Roosevelt, he is no fool. He and his Jewish advisers know what they want and how to get it, and they are working adroitly and secret ly and relentlessly to accomplish their ends. If the President and Secretary Perkins do not stand for sabotage and communism, why do they so steadfastly refuse to deport the alien red, Bridges, and others of his kind? Be it said to the everlasting credit of the Dies Committee and the House of Representatives that the committee was not swayed or intimidated by this fulmination of the President, and that the House by an overwhelming majority re-appointed them, and by a vote of 320 to 27 appropriated sufficient funds to continue their work. I quote from the report of the Dies Committee liberally because the subject is one of such vital importance to us all: \"We have shown that communism is a world-wide revolutionary movement aiming ultimately at the setting up of a world union of soviet socialist republics. This is a proposition which is beyond dispute. It is substantiated by voluminous literature of the Com- munists themselves . . . \"The Communist code of ethics not only permits, but actually glo- rifies as virtuous, such immoralities as perjury, destruction of property, the beating and maiming of workers who refuse to fol- low the dictates of the Communists, shootings, stabbings, kidnap- pings, and bombings.

This is the cr uel, diabolical code of the \"Elders\" called the \"Protocols.\" They represent the same plan for subjugating peoples and governments, and establishing their kingdom of the elders. They both originated in distorted Asiatic minds and are both founded upon the philoso- phy of the Talmud. 42 The committee summarized their findings in part as follows: \"Whereas it once employed the frank slogan of \"the Defense of the Soviet Union,\" it works today to embroil this country in a foreign war by the propagation of the doct rine of 'collective security.' \"It seeks ultimately the overthrow of the American form of gov- ernment as established by the Constitution of the United States. \"It aims to set up a dictatorship of the proletariat in this country, notwithstanding its present tactic al silence on this fundamental tenet of communism . . . \"It hides behind civil liberties in pursuing ends which will destroy civil liberties for all but the ruling few of the proletarian dictator- ship . . . \"It stifles the creative impulses of the individual by its deadening regimentation . . . \"It seeks to sabotage and crippl e our economy on every possible ofiting by the resulting economic crises . . .   41 26 and 29.

The findings read like a chapter taken from the protocols. They have the same philosophy, the same objective, and advo cate the-same methods as set out in the protocols. They represent the plan of the Elders and the \"Jew deal,\" and of the present Jew administration for the de struction of our go vernment in order to pave the way for their soviet dictatorship.

This report of the Dies Committee and the previous report of the Committee reveal the fact that the communists have many organizations under high-sounding and attractive names, in addition to the Communist Par- ty which is avowedly communistic; that all of these organizations are abun- dantly supplied with money for their wo rk, the greater part of which is fur- nished by Moscow. It is reported that there are now 80 times as many communists in America as there were in Russia when the Russian government was overthrown, and three and one-half times more than there are in Russia today; that they have in the United States 800 national organizations with thousands of branches having an estimated membership of 6,500,000; that they have 600 newspapers and magazines printed in all languages and circulated regularly in the United States; that they own publishing houses, book stores, film laboratories and theatres, etc., that they maintain 200 national so-called cultural movements, 62 national communist youth movement s and 33 national so-called defense movements; and that they spend an es timated $10,000,000 annually in the United States to promote civil war. 44 In view of this menace to our country, it detracts from the report of the Dies Committee for it to devote several pages to a discussion of the German Bund and to classify this Bund with the communists. Even if it has 25,000 members, and even if they are actively at work (and the report of the committee does not disclose it) they are a mere bagatelle as compared with the activities of the communists. It is the contention of the Bund leaders that they are combating communism and that that is the purpose of their organization. Undoubtedly George Deatheridge, Robt . E. Edmondson, James True, General George Van Horn Mosely, Col. E. N. Sa nctuary, Gerald B. Winrod, Win. Dud- ley Pelley, and Chas. B. Hudson are fighting communism. They are not rack- eteers, as the committee intimates; they are not \"selling religious and racial hatred,\" as the committee states. It does not add to the dignity and weight of this report for the committee to go out of its way to besmear these patriots who are endeavoring to render a service to their country in its hour of great peril. General George Van Horn Mosely subm itted a strong statement to the com- mittes in which he showed conclusively that this communism that now con- fronts us and which the committee so clearly portrays and forcefully condemns and promoted by Jews.

In their two reports there is not a word that reveals the real authors of the deviltry that they condemn. Why? It is because of the \"invisible power and its abiding-place.\" I do not wish to detract in the least from the committee's very able report. They have honestly and courageously re vealed a threatening situation that we did not know existed. In passing judgment upon their work we should take into consideration the invisible power that rules our country and our govern- ment. Already this power has publicly th reatened to contribute $250,000 to defeat Martin Dies, chairman of the committee, in his present race for re- election. This invisible force \"whose abiding place is unknown\" has the power to defeat any member of this committee for office, and the power to elect a president of the United States. This power is manifested in the effort of President Roosevelt to suppress the work of the Dies Committee, in the propaganda of the press and radio to drag us into war, and the distress and povert y that pervades the land. Its \"abiding place\" has been in Paris, France, and in the directing head of the Rothschild fortune, to-wit: Jeroboam Rothschild al ias Georges Mandel. All of this perni- cious activity by many agencies to subvert our government, in the final analy- sis reaches back to that head. No foreigner should be admitted to citizenship or to hold office, whether Jew or Gentile. We, the American people are the \"chosen people,\" and not the Jews and the foreigners. We are capable of running our own government in our own way without their help; and they are not capable of doing so. They have not had the necessary training, and a few ye ars of residency here does not imbue them with our spirit of morality and government. They cannot be changed over night by merely taking the oath of allegiance. We should classify the Jews as a race and bar them from entering the United States. We have barred other Asiatics,—Japanese, Chinese, etc. Why not the Jews? They are less desirable than the Chinese and Japanese because they are shrewder, more destructive, and their goal is to fleece us and to destroy our government. All Jews who have migrated here since 1914 should be deported, together with their progeny. The foreigners have polluted our citize nship and our government.

Tammany Hall is not the good old Irish Catholic organization that it used to be. Corrupt as it has always been repute d to be, it is infinitely worse now. There was some limit to its graft, even in the days of Boss Tweed, but there is none now. Jno. J. Hines, recently co nvicted of graft, was the dispenser of relief funds for the Roosevelt regime in New York City. He was an appropriate and an artistic administrator of these funds. The corrupt ion was so foul and rotten that it appears to have turned the stomach of ev en so tough a politician and so loyal a friend as Jim Farley. It is the philosophy of the Roosevelt regime to \"tax, tax, tax, and spend, spend and spend, and elect, elect and elect.\" According to the press reports Harry Hopkins, our former relief administra tor and present Secretary of Commerce, actually boasted of it,—which he of course denied. Whenever they make a slip and give us a glimpse of what they propose to do to us it is always a \"damned lie\" or a \"deliberate lie.\" Everywhere it is bribery and corruptio n. Senator Tobey, in a speech in the United States Senate, said: \"Shame on the American people ! There is something the matter with us today. Are there any strings on us? Are we still free men? If so, we should cry out, 'Unclean ! Unclean!' and determine that so far as lies within our power we will put the bars up against a re- petition or recurrence of such practices.\" Never before this regime ha ve we had anything like it.

The Roosevelt family are \"out for the dough.\" They appear to be content for the balance of us to be poor, but for themselves they prefer \"the fleshpots of Egypt.\" The Saturday Evening Post (before the Jews bought it) published a series of articles revealing Col. Jimmy Roosevelt's enormous profits from the insurance firm of Sargent & Roosevelt. Insurance is a favorite method of graft because it is semi legitimate, easily concealed, and the \"picking\" is rich. A suit was filed by a firm of insurance brokers agains t a Boston bank for $25,000 for insur- ance premiums, alleging that they were entitled to these premiums and that the bank had diverted them corruptly to Roosevelt & Sargent in order to obtain favors from the Roosevelt administration. The above quotation from Senator Tobe y was about insurance that a ship- building company had been forced to place with the son of a powerful Wash- ington official, without naming the father or the son. If it was not Jimmy there must be others in the same game, but the probability is that it was Jimmy. Shortly before or after this exposure by the Saturday Evening Post, Jimmy was made secretary to the President and a Colonel in the Marines. The latter posi- tion is a sinecure since he performs no service, but it carries a salary of $10,000,—a rather generous gift from Da d, of the despised taxpayers money. Jimmy held the position of secretary to the President only a short time when he resigned to become associated in some capacity with Samuel Goldwyn of the movies. (It is a matter of conjecture whether he resigned his position as Colonel of the Marines with its $10,000 salary.) The press reported that this change was made because of the affection recently developed between the Jew, Sam Goldwyn, and Colonel Jimmy. It appears to have been a case of love at first sight. It has since developed that indictments were pending against Sam Goldwyn and others for violation of the anti-trust laws, and that Jimmy was made a defendant in these bills of indictment. Does anyone imagine for a moment that Jimmy will be prosecuted, convicted and punished? How can he be released without releasing the others? These slick Jews don't pay big salaries from love and affection; it is always quid pro quo with them. But Jimmy proved a disap- pointment. He did not get the anti-trust suit dismissed and the love match is over. Some coarse grained observer unfeelingly said that when Sam discovered that Jimmy was not president of the United States he fired him. Jimmy is now a producer on his own, or with his mother."},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"149 who invented the New Dea The Associated Press carried a story on August 6, 1940, that Jimmy and his mother (Eleanor) have been sued by the estate of Ernest Tollor (a notorious Jew communist who committed suicide) fo r using the play \"Pastor Hall\" with- out paying for the privilege. The play is an anti-Nazi propaganda play. It is evidently being produced for the purpos e of promoting war hysteria and inci- dentally to realize a little coin in the operation, or vice versa. When Col. Jimmy went with Sam he resi gned his position with Sargent & Roo- sevelt; and his mother, Eleanor, was elec ted a director in his place; the busi- ness was too profitable to allow it to ge t out of the family. Mrs. Eleanor Roose- velt is writing a daily column for the press under the caption \"My Day,\"—and surely it is her day and also that of he r family. It is a profitable day and they are all \"making hay while the sun shines .\" She is periodically advertising a cosmetic over the radio. From these activities she is receiving large emolu- ments;—not by virtue of he r ability, for she is mediocre, but because she is the wife of the President of the United States. The President's second son, Elliot Roosevelt, made a deal with the Russian Government to sell the soviet 50 Douglas military planes, from which he re- ceived or was to receive a commission of $500,000. Mr. Fokker, in testifying before the senate committee investigating the munitions industry, explained that he thought the price excessive but that he had been persuaded by Elliot and his associate Mr. Stratton, that Elliot had enough influence with the Ex- port-Import Bank and the Russian Purchasing Commission to swing the deal. 45 The Roosevelt family is thrifty people; they overlook no opportunities. It is in the blood. The New Deal regime is rotten from top to bottom and from, center to circumference. It is an alien regime;- —alien to our code of morality, to our system of government, and to the spirit of our institutions. It is a typical Jew- ish Administration. It is reported that when the President visited Brazil in November, 1936, he made a speech in which he said: \"I am leaving you tonight with great regret. There is one thing, however, that I shall remember, and that is that it was two people l—the President of Brazil and the Pres-   45 See Speech of Congressman J. C.

No, the Presidents of the United States and Brazil did not \"invent the new deal\" as Mr. Roosevelt boastfully says. It was handed to both of them by Inter- national Jewry, the \"learned Elders of Zion.\" To Mr. Roosevelt through Elders Baruch and Frankfurter, and to Mr . Vargas through other Elders. The President of Brazil was elected as a liberal. Soon after his election he overthrew the constitutional government of Brazil and assumed the role of a dictator. It was a mere \"push over.\" Two kindred spirits with the same plan and the same objective. The difference between them is that Vargas has got there and Mr. Roosevelt is still \"On Our Way.\" We can well imagine what would have happened if the President had succeeded in his \"purge\" campaign; and it will happen anyway, if he is elected for a third term. I fully endorse the sentiments expressed in the following anonymous verses: \"An applicant stood at the gates of hell, And the devil himself had answered the bell.

Evidently he anticipates that he will be worshipped as the founder or a new order and that there will be pilgri- mages to his tomb, as there are to Lenin' s. \"Vanity, vanity, all is vanity\" and conceit. In the language of Puck: \"O what fools these mortals be!\" We are now suffering from a transitional period when the Jews are attempting to create an \"intensified centralization of government,\" and to \"regulate me- chanically all the actions of the political life by new laws.\" They are seeking to bring this change about by lies and corruption.

We ha ve fooled, bemused and corrupted the youth of the goyim by rearing them in principles and theories which are known to us to be false, although it is by us that they have been inculcated.\" 47 It is a fact of common knowledge that Jews and reds now occupy many of the chairs in our colleges and universities. They appear to specialize on the chair of Political Economy where the students are taught to believe in the infamous gold standard. Many of our leading institutions of learning are now properly regarded as hot-beds of communism. Our fine inexperienced young men and women, eager for knowledge, receive and absorb this insidious poison and their minds and characters are warped by it. These false political and financial theories are all a part of their plan for the subjugation of the people of the world. It was the plan pursued in Germany, even in the age of Disraeli, which culminated in World War I and finally World War II. Sidonia (Rothschild) then obse rved that most of the \"professorial chairs are now in our (Jew) hands\" and that the result would be revolution and war.

This method, as certain as it is, is too slow for the \"learned,\" greedy, and ambitious Elders. By expan- sion and contraction of currency and credit the rich are always made richer and the poor are made poorer; and the po ssessions of the weak are acquired by the strong, and thus great wealth and great poverty are created. Obviously, a country cannot be subjected to currency and credit manipulation that has a sufficient quantity of money or currency in circulation, for credit is directly dependent on the quantity of money in circulation;—the more money the greater the basis of credit; the less mo ney the less the basis of credit. Credit is, of course, dependent upon the will of both the man who seeks the credit and the one who extends it, but it will not be sought or extended if there is thought to be an inadequate volume of money for its redemption. It is essen- tial in order to control at will the expansion and contraction of credit that there be some supreme authority with the power to increase or decrease at will the volume of money in circulation. Prior to the regime of the Rothschilds this power resided in the kings and em- perors of the world, for they were then the supreme authority. In our country our National Constitution vested this power in the Congress of the United States. At the time of the adoption of our National Constitution state banks issued their currency notes payable in gold and silver which circulated as cur- rency, and this system continued until after the Civil War. This state bank currency added materially to the volume of money in circulation and to the stability of credit and of values. Since the Civil War and until recently National banks issued their currency notes, base d upon United States bonds and re- deemable by the national government, which circulated as currency and which"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"154 contributed materially to the supply of money and the stability of credit and of values. Under the Rothschild influence the banking systems of the world were all radi- cally changed. The supreme authority to issue money, as well as to extend cre- dit, was transferred by the various governments to the bankers of their respec- tive countries. The Bank of England be came the model for other central banks of the world. At the time of the establishment of the Federal Reserve System our govern- ment was the only one of any consequence that even pretended to exercise its sovereign right to issue and control the volume of money in circulation. The establishment of the Federal Reserve System operated as a complete surrender to the banking fraternity of the sovereign power of the American people to regulate values through thei r congressional representa tives, as guaranteed to them by their national constitution. The panic of 1907 was, like all of our other panics, a manipulated one. It was brought about by the refusal of the reserve banks of New York to pay currency to their country bank depositors, which in turn made it necessary for these banks to refuse to pay their depositors in currency. It was therefore due pri- marily to an insufficient quantity of cu rrency in circulation and an inadequate method of increasing the supply. There was universal demand for a change of the system and for an adequate volume of money to meet the demands of commerce. Congress appointed a committee, called the Monetary Commission, with Senator Nelson W. Aldrich of Rhode Island as chairman, to study the banking systems of the world and to report its findings. This committee made one or more trips to Europe and some two years after its appointment file d an exhaustive report of more than four thousand pages, which was never re ad by anybody. In the meantime the bankers and the various commercial bodies and the farmers and the laborers in their conventions, and the politicians and the press were all with one voice demanding a banking and currency system that would make future panics and depressions impossible. The keynote of President Wilson's campaign for the presidency in 1912 was the reform of our banking and currency syst em and he was elected upon that is- sue. Immediately after his election he submitted that subject to Congress in a very strong message, pointing out the inadequacy of the existing system and the necessity for a system that would provide an adequate supply of currency and credit to meet the demands of in dustry and commerce and that would insure the full employment of labor, and high prices and wages. His message"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"155 and his campaign speeches all indicated that he had a keen understanding of the money question and that he desired to establish a system that would afford an adequate volume of money and cred it, and would sustain high prices and wages. There then followed a great struggle, fe igned or real, between the big city bankers and the Administration. The bankers sought to establish a central bank with power to contro l currency and credit and with themselves in control of the bank. They threatened that if th is was not done that they would dena- tionalize and would have nothing whatever to do with the system. The Admin- istration apparently sought to reserve to the government its sovereign power to issue money and to establish a decentralized banking system to supply cre- dit. The question of the conditions under which new currency would be issued and whether or not the currency note should be a bank note or a government note were important i ssues in the struggle. The original Federal Reserve Act emerged as a result of this controversy. The big banks without a single exception were satisfied and accepted this system. President Wilson and Secretary McAdoo were apparently satisfied with it. President Wilson said of it, that it wa s a charter of freedom to commerce and industry and that men could go forward with their undertakings with assur- ance and without fear that their possessions would be taken from them by the contraction of currency and credit. In the midst of this campaign for the reform of our banking and currency sys- tem Paul Warburg, a German Jew, migrated from Frankfort-on-Main, the original home of the Rothschilds, to Am erica. He was at the time a member of the Rothschild banking firm in Frankf ort-on-Main and he became a member of Kuhn, Loeb & Company in New York, the American branch of the Roth- schilds, upon his arrival here. The followi ng is the Naval Secret Service report on him in December, 1918: \"Warburg, Paul, New York City, German; was naturalized an American citizen 1911, was decorated 1912 by the Kaiser; was vice-chairman of United States Federal Reserve Board; is a weal- thy and influential banker; handled large sums furnished by Germany for Lenin and Trotsky; subject has a brother who is leader of the espionage system (of Germany).\" The brother here mentioned was Felix, who afterward migrated here and was a member of Kuhn, Loeb & Co., and Chief of the American Elders. Soon after his arrival in New York Paul Warburg calle d in conference the leading New York bankers and submitted to them a plan for the reform of our banking and cur-"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"156 rency system, which they enthusiastically endorsed. It was then submitted to the Aldrich Monetary Commission and approved by the commission, despite the fact that they had spent two years of study and filed a four thousand page report on the subject. It was in its essential features the charter of the Bank of England. The Aldrich Monetary Commissi on submitted this plan to Congress in the form of a bill known as the Aldrich Bill. The Democrats immediately arrayed themselves solidly against it. There was great opposition to it throughout the land, because it was openly and brazenly a centralized banking system that vested the bankers with the sovereign power to issue and control the volume of money, and because also of our very sad experience with the First and Second Banks of the United States. Upon this issue primarily the Republican Party wa s defeated and President Wilson and the Congressional Democratic candidates elected. It thereupon became necessary to revise and rewrite the Aldrich Bill and to at least camouflage it in order to make it acceptable to the country. Frank A. Vanderlip, then President of the National City Bank, gives an account of this revision in his memoirs. It appears ther efrom that he and Henry Davison of J. P. Morgan & Company, and Paul Warburg of Kuhn, Loeb & Company held a secret conference on Jekyll Island (how appropriate the name) near Savannah, Georgia, and that they then and there re wrote the bill conforming it in appear- ance to the requirements of President Wilson and the Democratic Party, but preserving the substance of the Aldrich Bill. The honor, such as it is, for this iniquitous bill is claimed by many people. The Republicans claim it because it was in fact the Aldrich Bill in disguise, and the Democrats because it was in fact endorsed and adopted by a Democratic Ad- ministration. Carter Glass claims it because he was then Chairman of the House Banking and Currency Committee and it bore in part his name. Paul Warburg claimed it because it was in fact his baby and he acknowledged it as such. He supplied the frame work of it, which was colored and mildly altered by Vanderlip and Davison. But President Wilson and McAdoo and Glass had practically nothing to do with it except to pilot it through Congress. The Federal Reserve System is the product of the Rothschilds and its adoption was secured in the same underground, deceptive manner that they always employ to obtain their objectives. Paul Warburg evidently came to America to reform our banking and currency system and evidently he and the Rothschild interest then anticipated the world war, although it did not come about until some three years later."},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"157 They, of course, knew that such war would necessarily produce great expan- sion of currency and credit and of valu es and that money would be cheapened accordingly and that a \"killing\" could be made by contracting it. They also knew that America as the producer and seller of food and war materials would receive vast quantities of gold in paym ent for them. They also knew that under our financial system as it then existed this great influx of gold would enorm- ously increase our volume of money and basis of credit, that money would be correspondingly cheapened and values increased and that great and perma- nent prosperity in America would be the inevitable result, and that this infla- tion and prosperity would likely extend to all other countries. It was, therefore, necessary to their plans to sterilize this gold and to put the American banking and currency system on a credit basis an d to bring it under their own control. This is the sordid story of the greatest disaster that ever befell the American people. We then surrendered to Jero boam Rothschild and his successors, complete dominion over our currency and credit, over prices and wages, and over our welfare and happiness. Prior thereto he had great influence through his Morgan & Co., and Kuhn, Loeb & Co., banks and their subsidiaries and affiliates, but now his authority is made supreme and unlimited. This surrend- er perfected his control over the economy of all the people of the world."},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"XXII. DEFLATIONS OF 1920 AND 1930 \"Economic crises have been produced by us for the goyim by no other means than the withdrawal of money from circulation. Huge capitals have stagnated, withdrawing money from States, which were constantly obliged to apply to those same stagnant capitals for loans. These loans burdened the finances of the State with the payment of interest and made them the bond-slaves of these capitals . . . The concentration of industry in the hands of capitalists out of the hands of sm all masters has drained away all of the juices of the peoples and with them also of the states.\"— From Protocol 20. The language and the phrases of the original Federal Reserve act were so ob- scure and ambiguous, that President Wilson and Congress may have been deceived into believing that it was in fa ct what it pretended to be. It may be that the President accepted it as being in his judgment an improvement over the then existing system and as being the best bill he could then get. It may be that he expected to later perfect it by amendment and to make it the reliable servant of commerce and industry and of the people, and not their tyrannical master. If such was the President's purpose it has operated \"the other way around.\" It has been perfected, it is true, but it ha s been perfected as a central bank with the sovereign power in the \"Federal Reserve Board\" to \"issue money and con- trol the value thereof\" in plain violation of our National Constitution. Every perfecting amendment that the Elders have wanted has been adopted by a complaisant Congress until it now has infinitely more power than either the First or Second Banks of the United States ever had and more than the Aldrich Bill proposed, and it has abused such po wer shamefully and to the irreparable injury of the American people. Senator Glass may be entitled to credit for these perfecting amendments though they bear the earmarks of the Rothschilds. It is he who has sponsored and piloted them through the United States Senate and through Congress. Upon the adoption of the bill President Wilson appointed Paul Warburg as deputy governor and a few months later as governor of the system. He held that position until 1919 when he resign ed and his assistant, W. P. G. Harding, was made governor. In the meantime William G. McAdoo had resigned his position as Secretary of the Treasury and David Houston, Secretary of Agricul-"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"160 ture, had been appointed Secretary of the Treasury. In the meantime, also, Barney Baruch had supplanted Edward M. House as President Wilson's confi- dential adviser. This was the set-up when the deflation of 1920 was decreed. It was a great shock to the bankers of the country when they found that they could not discount their \"eligible\" notes and bills at the Federal Reserve Banks. It had been proclaimed throughout the length and breadth of the land that agricultural and commercial notes could, by the endorsement and guaranty of member banks, be converted into currency ad libitum. The banks and the people were importuned by the treasu ry department and other government authorities to buy government bonds and to produce food in order to help win the war, and consequently the people had borrowed liberally and the banks had extended credit liberally, believing that the Federal Reserve System would extend credit if needed. Then without previous warning the Federal Reserve management arbitrarily refused to extend credit to the member banks that served the commercial and agricultural interests of the country. The Federal Reserve authorities at first denied responsibility, claiming that the deflation was a natural reaction from high prices and wages that it originated in Japan, etc. After the publication of the minutes of the secret conference of May 15, 1920, of the Federal Advisory Council, Federal Reserve Board and th e Governors of the Federal Reserve Banks, they then admitted that the job wa s theirs and admitted also that it was a mistake. These minutes, which they thought no one could ever dig up, set out in detail what they proposed to do, the manner of doing it and the reasons therefore. They said in substance that the \"vicious circle of increasing prices and wages must be checked;\" that people were ex travagant and that this must be cor- rected; and strange as it may now sound they said also that people were not working hard enough and not producin g enough goods to meet the demands of the world! They proposed to correct all of these things by refusing to issue currency and extend credit. Of seventy bankers, wh o attended this conference, only two voted against this unjust, illegal and destructive program, which demon- strates, if demonstration Is necessary, how unwise it is to in vest an interested class, even as intelligent and righteous as the bankers profess to be, with the sovereign power to fix and regulate values and the prosperity of the country. No doubt some of the bankers who vote d for this program suffered grievously as a consequence of it."},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"161 There followed one of the most destructive panics and depressions this coun- try has even known. The borrowers who had extended their borrowings to meet the demands of their government, and the banks that extended credit most liberally for the same purpose, suffered most. Many of them became bankrupt and many of them, both borrowers and lenders, died by suicide and despondency and disease as a result th ereof. Even government bonds were depreciated to such an extent that the original owners lost them and the banks that took them under foreclosure lost money on them. The national wealth was estimated prior to this depression at from 500 to 600 billion, afterward at from 250 to 300 bi llion. This meant a general reduction in values of from 200 to 300 billion dollars. This huge sum is more than the ex- penses of our National Government, incl uding all of its wars, from its estab- lishment up to 1914. With such terrible consequences and with proven and admitted responsibility for them it is difficult to believe that Congress would do nothing about it. But strange as it may seem no serious effort has ever been made to curtail the power that brought such disaster upon the country. On the other hand, it has been enlarged and amplified and legalize d, as far as Congress can do so, by perfecting amendments;—always sponsored by Carter Glass. It was, of course, necessary for the Fede ral Reserve banks to loosen up in order to prevent a debacle, with the result that there was considerable recovery in 1927, 1928 and 1929, and with the result also that there was considerable speculation in 1929 in anticipation of still further recovery. For the pretended purpose of checking this speculation the Federal Reserve management again decreed deflation, which they brought about in 1930 in precisely the same manner as in 1920, viz: by the contraction of currency and credit. They made no \"bones\" about it this trip; it was done openly and above board and they have never denied it, Congress having condoned the crime once it was assumed it would do so again. And Congress not only condoned both crimes but it has legalized the methods employed; and not only that, it has granted an indefinite charter to the sy stem and has given it additional power to deflate. The 1930 deflation was a reproduction of 1920 with substantially the same results. Our national wealth which ha d increased during the ten years inter- vening to about 400 billion dollars was reduced 40 to 50 per cent. It bank- rupted many men and many banks that had survived the depression of 1920 and many younger men who were in the midst of establishing themselves ; it transferred the property of the debtor to the creditor; it operated with the"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"162 greatest severity on the farmer and the laborer and their families; it reduced the value of farm products below the co st of production, in consequence of which many farmers lost their homes and means of living; it closed factories, and thereby about twelve million laborers lost their jobs and means of living and many of them lost their homes and became public charges. Both of these depressions were far more serious in their results than the short lived manipulated panic of 1907. The panic of 1907 was over almost as soon as the banks resumed their ordinary function of paying the checks of their depo- sitors in currency. At that time it was beyond the control of the Elders to force a substantially lower level of values because our banking system was then on a currency basis and not wholly on a credit basis as it was in 1920 and in 1930 and is now. Organized ostensibly to supply an adeq uate volume of currency and credit the Federal Reserve System has been perverted into a vast money and credit hoarding machine; organized for the pretended purpose of preventing panics and depressions, it has been employed to create the three most disastrous ones in the history of our country. Obviously, the remedy for the panic of 1907 was for the government to put into circulat ion a greater volume of money and to outlaw as traitors the conspirators who brought it about. Obviously, the reme- dy was not to turn over to these pirates the sovereign function of issuing mon- ey, as the Federal Reserve Act did. The remedy for the catastrophes of 1920 and of 1930 was and is now to get more money into circulation and to free the country from the control of this iniquitous Federal Reserve System. Obvi ously it was not to extend the power and charter of the system; and obviously also, it was not the \"new deal.\" The remedies suggested are so clear and si mple, and those adopted are so inade- quate and grotesque that even a congressman ought to be able to see and un- derstand the sham and hypocrisy of it all. The methods employed in putting over the English Bank Act were almost identical with those used here in perpe- trating the Federal Reserve Bank hoax. Th e British people did not understand that they were contracting their currency by demonetizing silver, and that their government was forever abdicating its sovereign right to control currency and credit and values, any more than we understood these things. They, however, obtained two important advantages that we did not get: (1) They were paid for the charter and for every one of its eight renewals, whereas we gave the Elders the charter and then renewed it indefinitely and we did not recieve a \"thin dime\" for this valuable monopoly; (2) The Bank of England (and for that matter the central banks of issue of all other countries) lends money direct at a low rate of interest to the people, whereas the Federal Re-"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"163 serve bank is authorized to lend only to member banks;—a \"banker's bank\" they call it, and so it is—\"lock, stock, and barrel.\""},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"XXIII. DEFLATION OF 1937 '\"The principal factor of success in political is the secrecy of its un- dertakings; the word should not agree with the deed.\" —From Protocol 7. It should always be remembered that the Federal Reserve System was created for the avowed purpose of supplying the country with an adequate volume of currency and credit. At the time of its consideration and adoption the com- merce of the country was in the process of recovery from the panic of 1907. This panic was, as has been stated, a manipulated panic, precipitated by the central reserve banks of New York City, and primarily due to the fact that we did not have a sufficient volume of money in circulation; the system was changed for the purpose of supplying such volume. There was universal demand for such change, led by the bankers of New York City. So eager were they for a change of system that the elder J. P. Morgan and the elder Geo. F. Baker (president of the First National Bank of New York) testified before the Pujo Committee that there was a \"Money Trust\" and that it was in the public interest that it be co ntrolled. This admission was at the time a matter of great surprise; the purpose of it is now better understood. In the light of subsequent events and of our present knowledge, we are justified in suspecting that the panic of 1907 was brought about for the purpose of estab- lishing the system we now have. I prefer to believe in the integrity and sincerity of Woodrow Wilson. I sup- ported him for the presidency, in ignorance, however, of the fact that his cam- paign was financed by Jews. Despite my bias, I must admit that the Wilson Administration was responsibl e for the deflation of 1920. President Wilson appointed Paul Warbur g, a member of the Rothschild bank- ing firm, as deputy governor and later governor of the Federal Reserve System. Warburg was the real author of the act an d was also author of the Aldrich bill. He openly advocated a central bank, an d publicly testified that the system could be transformed by administration into a central bank, and he proceeded to so transform it. He proposed the amendment that gave the system the pow- er of deflation, which President Wilson approved. Warburg, however, resigned before the deflation process was begun and thereby escaped the odium of it. When the Federal Reserve Act was adopted the Democrats thought they had won a great victory, but nevertheless ma ny well informed Republicans claimed"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"166 credit for the Act and that the bill was in fact the Aldrich Bill under a different name and in a different dress. The Democrats thought that the Federal Re- serve Board was only a medium of contact between the twelve reserve banks and that the banks would be governed by their respective boards of directors and would function independently of it . It was originally provided that a member bank could at will convert its eligible notes into currency by simply endorsing them and sending them into th e reserve bank of its district for dis- count; and the notes of the farmer and those given in the course of commerce were in the preferred class. This method of issuing currency was intended to supply the adequate volume of currency and credit that the people of the country desired and were prom- ised by the Democratic Party. It has all been changed since. The original pur- pose of the act has been entirely lost sight of and has been grossly perverted. Paul Warburg was right when he testif ied before the Senate Committee that the system could be transformed into a good system (for the Elders) by admin- istration. It has in fact been transfor med adroitly by administration but more radically by legislation. Just prior to the panic of 1920 Congress adopted an amendment empowering the Federal Reserve Banks to limit the discount privileges of member banks and to refuse to discount eligible notes. This amendment changed the whole character of the system. It could no longer operate automatically in response to the demands of the people. Thereafter currency could only be issued at the discretion of the Federal Reserve Banks ,—which was subsequently changed to the Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Reserve Banks promptly exercised this power and promptly brought on the panic of 1920 in pursuance of the resolution adopted at the conference between their representatives and the members of the Federal Re- serve Board on May 15, 1920. The depressions of 1920 and of 1930, and the present depression would not have been possible except for this change in the act. Every step in the administration of the system and every act of Congress amending the law since its enactment, have been in the direction of a centra- lized banking authority with the power of life and death over commerce and industry. Without authority of law the Federal Reserve Board established an \"open market committee\" to fix and regulate the volume and value of money, with the Governor of the New York Fede ral Reserve Bank as chairman. It is and was the office of this committee to expand the currency by buying securi- ties, etc., on the open market in New York and Chicago, and issuing in pay- ment therefore the notes of the Federal Reserve banks. To contract the curren-"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"167 cy the process is reversed; they sell securities and receive currency in payment therefore, which is thereby withdrawn from circulation. This supplanted the original system of issuing currency in payment of eligible notes discounted by member banks. The difference is that under the present system the \"open market\" committee determines how much currency is good for us; under the original system the demands of commerce and industry and the member banks determined the quantity of it; the one depends on the inte- grity and wisdom of the committee, the other responds automatically to the currency and credit needs of the people. The depression of 1930 and the remedy for it was the issue in the 1932 cam- paign. Mr. Roosevelt charged that President Hoover was responsible for the depression and that he had adopted inad equate measures to restore prosperi- ty. There was no demand by either political party or any candidate for office that the Federal Reserve System be converted into a centralized banking au- thority and that its powers be enlarged. No man could have been elected Pres- ident of the United States on any such platform. Under the pretense of protecting bank deposits and of creating a corporation for that purpose, for which there was some demand,—the Congress enacted the bill known as the \"Banking Act of 1935.\" This bill completed and perfected the system as a centralized banking authority with much greater power than was provided in the original Aldrich Bill. Among other things it legalized the \"open market committee\" and provided that the members of the Federal Re- serve Board and five members of the Federal Reserve banks (to be selected by their directors) should constitute this \"open market committee.\" The Bank Act of 1935 called for a new Governor, and new members of the Fed- eral Reserve Board to be appointed by the president,—and Mr. Roosevelt named Marriner S. Eccles as Chairman of the Board and appointed an entirely new board. All of them were new members with the exception of Professor Miller who had been a consistent and trustworthy deflationist from the begin- ning. The original Federal Reserve Act required the member banks to maintain re- serves in the Federal Reserve Banks as follows: country banks and those in smaller cities, 7% of the amount of their deposits; banks in reserve cities, 10% ; and in central reserve cities, 13%. These reserves were not subject to check ad libitum by the banks, as under the former system, but could only be checked against ''under the regulations and subject to the penalties, provided by the Federal Reserve Board.\" They were intended to be and were in fact, static and sterilized. To check against them meant the suspension of the bank,—and its"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"168 insolvency. They served no purpose except to sterilize and impound that much currency and credit, and the country did not suffer from them except to that extent. There was no need, or public demand for increasing them. The \"Banking Act of 1935\" authorized the Federal Reserve Board \"in order to prevent injurious credit expansion or contraction\" to double these reserve requirements. Obviously there could be no \"credit expansion\" by doubling the amount of sterilized money and credit, and obviously it meant only to empow- er the Board to bring about credit contraction. Such delegation of power was wholly unnecessary because the Board had absolute power to expand and con- tract the volume of currency through the operations of the \"open market committee,\" which involved the power to expand and contract credit, for credit is dependent wholly on the supply of currency to support it. Moreover the Board had fully demonstrated its power to \"prevent injurious expansion\" in the catastrophes of 1920 and 1930. Evidently the purpose of this amendment was to provide a new method for bringing about deflation,—a different one from the old plan of refusing loans and advancing the discount rate. The old plan had come to be too thoroughly understood, and discredited by too freque nt use. Since Mr. Roosevelt had been elected to correct the evils of the Hoover administration, he could not bring about the same character of deflation in the same manner without the risk of having the whole \"Jew Deal\" upset by Congress; he must employ a different method and a more subtle technique. The Federal Reserve Board did not permit this power to remain dormant very long. On August 26, 1936, they advanced these reserve requirements 50%, but the result was not satisfactory to them. On January 30, 1937, they adopted the following resolution: \"Effective at the opening of business on March 1, 1937, the re- quirements as to reserves to be maintained by each member bank will be 75 per cent above the requirements prescribed by section 19 of the Federal Reserve Act, and effective at the opening of busi- ness May 1, 1937, the requirements as to reserves to be main- tained by each member bank will be 100 per cent above the re- quirements prescribed by section 19 of the Federal Reserve Act.\" That did the job, and the Roosevelt depression soon followed and is still on, and prosperity is not \"around the corner\" as the Elders and their sycophants tell you it is. There is now sterilized and hoarded in the \"reserve accounts\" of the Federal Reserve Banks the huge sum of $13,863,000,000. This is more than ten times the volume of money we have in circulation. It would furnish a"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"169 sound basis for at least $70,000,000,000 of credit if this money was in circu- lation and in the vaults of the member banks. The depression would not have occurred if this money and credit had remained in circulation. It was with- drawn for the purpose of bringing on the depression. This order of the Federal Reserve Board operates with the greatest severity on the small and weak banks. They, together with all other banks, have been forced by the Roosevelt Administration to subscribe for government bonds, with the result that they are loaded down with U. S. bonds. The government has now taken from them a large percentage of their liquid capital, which has left many of them with insufficient resources to meet the ordinary demands of their customers, or to earn reasonable profits. There is no precedent in other countries for such banking practice an d for such abuse of governmental au- thority. The \"Bank Act of 1935,\" insofar as it provided for guaranteeing bank deposits, originated in the House and it was limited to that one subject. The amend- ments were added by Carter Glass when the bill reached the Senate. Glass was on the conference committee between the two bodies and succeeded in putting over these amendments and afterward boasted of the achievement in the press. This ever-faithful servant of the Elders is always on the job with his amendments when there is a banking or currency measure before the Senate, for it is much easier to tack them on to some popular measure than to get them through independently upon their own merit or lack of merit. We may choose to believe in the good intentions of Mr. Roosevelt and to excuse him for this terrible crime, but we cannot close our eyes to the cold facts. The Federal Reserve Board is wholly of his selection and it has no doubt carried out his express orders. No official appointed by him will dare disobey him; should he do so he would be \"fir ed,\" for Mr. Roosevelt brooks no opposi- tion. In one of his press conferences Mr. Roos evelt sought to excuse the order of the Federal Reserve Board on the ground that some unnamed prices were too high and out of \"alignment,\" but even if that be true, it is a silly excuse for bringing such great distress upon the innocent people of the country. The fact is, some prices always have been and always wi ll be out of \"alignment\" due to supply and demand. There is this substantial difference between the Wilson 1920 deflation and the Roosevelt 1937 deflation: In 1920 pric es and wages were high and money of course correspondingly cheap. We had $3 wheat, $2 corn, 40c cotton, $1.50 to $2 per hour wages, labor was fully employed and scarce."},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"170 In 1937 we had been suffering from th e Hoover deflation for more than five years; we had spent billions of dollars upon Mr. Roosevelt's recommendations for the pretended purpose of relieving it; there was no substantial relief; prices and wages were still low and labor unemployed; we still had approximately 10,000,000 unemployed, and many millions on the dole. There was absolutely no excuse for the Roosevelt deflation.

Practi ces of the unscrupulous money changers stand indicted in the court of public opinion, rejected by the hearts and minds of men. \"True they have tried, but their e fforts have been cast in the pat- tern of an outworn tradition. Faced by failure of credit they have proposed only the lending of more money. Stripped of the lure of profit by which to induce our people to follow their false leader- ship, they have resorted to exhort ation, pleading tearfully for res- tored confidence. They only know the rules of a generation of self- seekers. They have no vision, and when there is no vision the people perish. \"Yes, the money changers have fled from their high seats in the temple of our civilization. We ma y now restore that temple to the ancient truths. The measure of the restoration lies in the extent to which we apply social values more noble than mere monetary profit , . . and there must be prevision for an adequate but sound currency.\" Fine words, very, very fine, and very, very true. This was the program he deli- berately promised the people of America in his inaugural address."},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"172 This message states clearly conditions that then existed, and the cause and the remedy therefor. There was great rejoicing among the people; for the people, while not understanding the money question, knew in a general way that their distressful situation was due to the corrupt management of our banking and currency system and here was promise of relief. If the Elders believed the President's sincerity there must have been \"weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth\" among them, for here was a man, whose election they had brought about, calling them selfish Shylocks and incompe- tents, and accusing them of responsibili ty for the deplorable conditions he so graphically depicted, and threatening to destroy their control of the system which had caused so much wreck and ruin. On the day following the delivery of this splendid speech the farm leaders, John N. Simpson, et at., called on the President and asked him to explain what he meant by the phrase \"There must be provision for an adequate but sound currency.\" The President said, according to press reports, that he meant that the government would exercise its constitutional duty to issue money and con- trol its value, that he would promptly cause enough money to be issued and put into circulation to restore wages and markets and values and prosperity to the country, and give a job to every man in the land who wanted to work. One of two things is true: either the President did not mean a word of his speech and of his clarifying statement to the farmers, or else he changed his mind on the following day, viz., March 6th. We cannot know which is true. It is difficult to believe that the President of the United States would make such statements with his fingers crossed and for the purpose of deceiving his friends and supporters; but it is equally inconceivable that he would change his mind upon this important subject, upon which he had deliberately spoken after having evidently given it great tho ught, within the short space of twenty- four hours time. It is of course possible that Brother Bar uch or some of the other Elders inter- viewed him shortly after the farmers and changed his purpose and his pro- gram, but it is not probable. His message turned out to be mere \"cunning and make-believe\" and it was no doubt inte nded as such. Whatever the truth may be, on the following day, March 6th, he issued a proclamation closing all the banks of the United States,—state as well as national, and good as well as bad. This was arbitrary, high handed, destructive, and illegal. Upon the point of its legality he says in his book, \"On Our Way,\" page four, that \"a friend of mine (probably Frankf urter) suggested that some of the war emergency legislation of 1917 had not been repealed and found for me a sta-"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"173 tute of that year covering the point.\" Even so, such statute could not be appli- cable to peace conditions, for Congress has no power to suspend the Constitu- tion and laws of the land except as a military measure, and its power even then is limited to military necessity. Besides, there was then no necessity for the grant or the usurpation or the exercise of such power. The banks of the country were as a rule sound and well managed. The trouble with them was that many of their customers had been bankrupted by an illegal deflation or were near bankruptcy, and as a conse- quence their collateral had been impaired. It was the direct and intended con- sequence of the contraction of currency and credit by the Federal Reserve management in 1930. They suffered from the further trouble that there was not enough money in their vaults and in circulation to enable them to pay their depositors in currency. The only place that they could get the money was from the Federal Reserve banks, which had the exclusive power of issue, which it refused to exercise. The clear remedy therefore was not the closing of the banks and the utter de- struction of many of them, but it was for the government to take over the Fed- eral Reserve System or compel it to pe rform the service for which it was orga- nized, or for the government to exercise its constitutional power to issue and put into circulation a sufficient quantity of money. The obvious and quickest remedy was for the President to remove the Federal Reserve management and appoint one that would discount the eligible paper of the member banks and issue them currency and thereby enable them to meet the currency demands and credit requirements of their customers. The obvious remedy was to reverse the deflation program of the Federal Re- serve System and to bring about just and reasonable inflation through the expansion of currency and credit. The President knew this to be the remedy and he promised to employ it, both in his inaugural message and in his state- ment to the farm representatives. If he had done so there would have been no occasion or excuse for his extravagant and unconstitutional reforms and his subsequent attack upon the Constitution itself. My own view is that Senator Long's estimate of the President is correct, and that he did not mean a word of what he said in his message and to the farmers. I think that he intended his so-called reforms from the beginning and that he needed a bewildered and poverty stricken people in order to put them over. As Senator Long so graphically said, it was \"high cockalorum Roosevelt and low cockalorum Hoover,\" the difference between them being only the differ-"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"174 ence between \"tweedledum and tweedledee.\" Mr. Roosevelt is only a \"skilled politician who has recourse to cunning and make-believe.\" In 1929 there were more than 30,000 state and national banks. The number had been reduced by deflation to 19,163 in 1932. As a result of this order 4,541 banks or approximately one-third of the remainder were pe rmanently closed and their deposits aggregating $4,356 ,799,000 were thereby frozen and a large percentage of them lost. (See Comptroller of the Currency Report of 1936, page 112.) The President thus ruthlessly destroyed the property of the several thousand stockholders of the closed banks and of their several million depositors in flagrant violation of law and of our National Constitution, and later boasted of this achievement in his book \"On Our Way.\" The effect of this order was further deflation, and to make bad matters worse. It froze the life savings of many thou sand depositors and transferred them from a state of comfort to one of povert y. They could have been saved, and the country could have been saved the expense of their maintenance, by the mere act of correcting the crime of 1930 in a legal way, viz., by reversing the process by which it had been perpetrated. The worst of it is that the President then knew that this could be done and promised to do it. This does not tell the whole story. The banks had already been reduced in number by the 1930 deflation (for whic h President Hoover is justly held re- sponsible) from 30,000 to 19,163. This further reduced the number to 15,806, or about half the number that existed in 1929. The human imagination can scarcely conceive such ruthless and reck less destruction of men and of values and it cannot estimate the injuries that the people sustained. It meant that the fortunes of approximately one-half of the thrifty men and women of the nation were either utterly destroyed or badl y impaired;—and the other half did not escape without serious injury. On January 15, 1934, the President submitted a special message to Congress, as set out in his book \"On Our Way,\" in which he said: \"Permit me once more to stress two principles. Our national cur- rency must be maintained as a sound currency which, in so far as possible, will have a fairly constant standard of purchasing power and be adequate for the purposes of daily use and the establish- ment of credit. \"The other principle is the inherent right of government to issue currency and to be the sole custodi an and owner of the base or re- serve of precious metals underlying that currency. With this goes"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"175 the prerogative of government to determine from time to time the extent and nature of the metallic reserve.\" John Stuart Mill or his disciple, David Ricardo, could not have stated the or- thodox principles of monetary science more clearly and forcefully. The Presi- dent cannot plead ignorance of the money question, for every message and speech that he has delivered on the subject shows that he understands it. There can be no restoration of values un til there is a sufficient volume of mon- ey in circulation to support them. That is as certain and as inevitable as the law of gravitation. If this volume of money rests upon the discretion of the Federal Reserve Board then those values will be whatever this Board chooses to make them, and they will be as stable as the mind of the Board is stable. Prior to the adoption of the Federal Reserve System the basis of our values rested upon the volume of money in circ ulation, and they were stable because the supply of money, except for hoarding, was stable,—but it has been unstable and erratic since, because it rests wholly upon credit and upon the discretion of selfish and designing men. What has the President done to give effect to his brave promises? What has he done to wrest the control of our currency system from the Shylocks, charged in his inaugural speech with controlling it, ex cept to leave them in control and to perfect their control ? What has he done toward increasing our currency supply in order to restore employment an d prosperity except to further reduce it? What has he done to restore the solvency of our country except to enorm- ously increase debts and taxes? Truly, th e Elders have furnished us a ruler of their own kind, a \"skilled politician who has recourse to cunning and make- believe,\" and whose \"words do not agree with his deeds.\""},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"XXV.

They give you the detailed estimates of the Treasury Department of our stock of money for these years, and where it is located. You will observe that in 1914 all of the \"reporting banks,\" which means all of th e banks of the country except the Fed- eral Reserve banks,—had in their vaul ts $1,630,000,000; and that in 1938 they had $991,500,000. Thus it appears that the banks had $638,500,000 more money in their vaults when the Fe deral Reserve System was established, 24 years ago, than they now have. You will observe also under the last column of figures that they estimate that there was in \"general circulation\" $1,829,400,000,—or $18.46 per capita in 1914; and $5,469,400,000 or $42.02 per ca pita in 1938. You will observe also that they do not count money in the Treasury, in the reporting banks or in the Federal Reserve banks as being in \"general circulation.\" This method of estimating the money in \"general circulation\" is obviously true as to money in the Treasury and in the Federal Reserve banks, for these mo- neys are hoarded and are not subject to check. But it is obviously false as to the moneys in the \"reporting banks\" for these moneys are subject to check and they pass from the banks daily by chec k to the people, and are therefore in circulation. Where is all of this money that they say is in \"general circulation\" and that they say is over and above the money that is in the Treasury and banks? There is only one place that it can be, to-wit: distributed among the people and in their \"tills and pockets.\" Any man of common sense knows that the people have not now an average of $42.02 in their pocket s, and that they did not have an aver- age of $18.46 in 1914. Any man of comm on sense knows that now, with busi- ness stagnant and prostrate, and with half of the people in poverty that they do not now possess more than double the amount of money that they had in 1914, when people generally were prosperous."},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"179 The Treasury Department explains this obviously false report by saying that there has been no \"corrected statement\" of the money in general circulation since 1861 and that their estimate \"includes all United States paper money in other lands, all money worn beyond po ssibility of redemption, and all money lost.\" In other words, they count as money in circulation in the United States all moneys issued since 1861, whether in ci rculation or not. But even this lame explanation does not explain the fact that the moneys in the pockets of the people (according to the official report) have increased from $18.46 per capita in 1914 to $42.02 in 1938,—whereas duri ng the same period the moneys in the banks have decreased from $16.30 per ca pita in 1914 to about $7.00 in 1938,— which is simply preposterous. Vast quantities of money have been lost or destroyed by fire, ship wreck, and otherwise, in the 80 years since a \"co rrected statement\" was made; and vast quantities of it are now in foreign lands. The all-important question to you and me is: how much of it is now in the hands of the people of this country? And that is a matter of supreme importance to us for by all of the accepted authorities the quantity of money that circulates among the people, including the reporting banks determines all values and measures all values. Money is called the \"yardstick of values\"; the more money the higher values, and the less, the lower. We are entitled to know what that yardstick is, and to have a yardstick that will establish and maintain reasonable values. Who can say what it is today? One man's guess is as good as another's. The only estimate that has ever come under my observation was made some years ago by a treasury expert by the name of McCoy who estimated it at $440,000,000, which at that time was ab out $4.00 per capita. It is probably less than that now, for the banks have less now than then, and conditions are much worse now than then, which indicate it. You can make your own guess. What would you say the people have in their pockets in your town? Let us take for example a town of 1,000 population, with a bank and 20 business houses. It will be composed of about 300 men and women over 21 years of age, and 700 children less than 21 years. The 20 business houses may normally have an average of $50 each in their tills, amounting to $1,000; the 300 men and women may have $5 each, or 1,500; the 700 children may average $1 each, or 700."},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"180 A grand total of $3,200; or $3.20 per capita. If we add to that the cash in the vault of the bank, which I estimate at 5,000 we have a total volume of money in circulation in the town of $8,200 or $8.20 per capita. But the Treasury Department does not count as money in circulation the $5,000 in the vault of the bank; they on ly count as money in circulation that which is in the hands of the people, and estimate it at $42.02 per capita. That estimate is not true and they know it. There is not a town or village or city in this broad land of ours where the people have an average of $42.02 of money in their pockets,—not one. If their estimate is correct the figures given in the example above would be about fourteen times more. The 20 business men must have an average of $700 each, amounting to—$14,000; the 300 men and women must have an average of $70 each, or 21,000; and all the children, including the babies, must have $10 apiece, or 7,000. This makes a total of $42,000 or $42 per capita for the people of the town. Would it not be fine if they had it! Talk about \"buying power,\" the people would have it; of our surplus products and poverty and distress, there would be none. \"Oh,\" but they say, \"Look at the $50, 000,000,000 on deposit in the banks;\" the banks are just \"bulging with money.\" That is not money, and even the Treasury Department does not count it as such, it is only bank credit, which must be paid in money. The banks, according to their sworn statements, only have $991,500,000 of real money with which to pay these 50 billion dollars,—which means that if all of them were called upon at one time th ey could only pay about 2 per cent of their deposits. They are in a helpless an d precarious position, and they do not dare to extend credit liberally; too many of them have been ruined by doing so. The moneys that measure values are bank notes and silver and gold and silver certificates,—primary money, as they call it. This primary money is our yardstick of value. We are entitled to kn ow what this yardstick is. What is it? They have deceived Congress and the country with lying reports of it, to the very great injury of the people. Let us no w have the truth, for \"truth is mighty and will make us whole.\""},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"181 This report is true as to the monies in the banks on the respective dates men- tioned, for it is based on the sworn reports of all the banks of the United States, which are in turn based on an actual count of the money. In 1914 the people were prosperous and happy, and the dole and the C. C. C. camps were unknown,—and according to th is official report the people then had in their pockets an average of $18.49. Now eleven million of our people are out of jobs, and one-third of our population (according to the President) is poorly housed and clothed and fed, an d yet they have in their pockets (as stated by this official report) an average of $42.02. I do not pretend to understand the trick or the system by which they count money in circulation that is not in circulation, but I do know that the people have not now and have never had an average of $42.02 per capita in their pockets. I assert that we now have in actual circulation less than $12 per capi- ta, of which less than $4 is in the po ckets of the people; and that there can never be any enduring prospe rity or any stability of credit and values until this basis is broadened by an adequate volume of money in circulation. This startling fact has been repeatedly called to the attention of the President and many members of Congress, but the lying statements of the Treasury and Comptroller of the Currency have been repeated from year to year since 1920 and accepted as true by Congress and the country. Prior to the creation of the infamous Federal Reserve System true and reliable report s were made. Evi- dently it is the purpose of the management of the system to deceive Congress and the country, and it has done so to our great injury. They have recently taken a census of everything we have, including mortgag- es,—except our money. A census of the volume of money in circulation is the only information of any material importan ce to us; the other is all \"fol-de-rol.\" A census or an inventory could just as easily be taken of the money in the pockets of the people, and would be of great value. It would show upon what an insecure and flimsy foundation all credit and values rest; it would blast the oft-repeated sophistry that there is plenty of money, that all we need is a little \"confidence;\" it would clearly reveal the ab surdity of all the New Deal rot, for it would reveal the cause of our distress and the remedy therefore; it would, it is to be hoped, cause Congress to take the necessary steps to put in circulation a sufficient volume of money, with adequate measures to keep it in circulation. If we had $42.02 per capita in actual ci rculation the prices of all products and wages—the price level—would be approxim ately that of 1920; we would have no relief rolls and C. C. C. camps, an d no curtailment of production; no need for regulation of hours and wages, and no excuse for the destruction of our"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"182 National Constitution. Instead of being a money and credit expanding system to supply the ever-growing need of expanding population and commerce,—the Federal Reserve System is a vast currency and credit hoarding machine. With its true character and purpose clearly revealed, Congress gratuitously granted it an indefinite charter five years prior to the expiration of the original charter, and by the Bank Act of 1935 gave it carte blanche authority to regulate our welfare. There can be no stability of values that are dependent wholly upon credit, for there is no foundation for such values other than the will of the creditor. When it is to his advantage to reduce them, thereby increasing the buying power of money, he will do so. It is always to his advantage to have cheap commodities and dear money, and so it is normally that way. Let Congress exercise its con- stitutional duty and cause an adequate vo lume of money to be paid into circu- lation and kept in circulation, and values will adjust themselves to such vo- lume and will be high or low in proportion to the volume, without the opera- tion of an \"open market committee\" or any other committee. At the time Hoover left off with his deflation and Roosevelt took over the job, we had in circulation $730,435,000 of national bank notes. By 1936 we had none. All of them had been retired and cancelled by the compulsion of the Roosevelt Administration. (See Report of the Comptroller of the Currency for 1936, page 112.) This meant a cancellation of about $5.50 per capita, or about 50% of the sum of money we now have in circulation. It is but $257,265,000 less than all the banks of the country had in their vaults, of money of all kinds, on June 3, 1936. If the members of Congress cannot understand this lying deception after read- ing this very simple explanation of it, let them investigate it themselves. Let them take a census of the money in their respective districts, or better still, let them cause a Congressional investigation to be made of the money in circula- tion in the United States. We have, as a matter of fact, about $1,4 00,000,000, or $11.00 per capita in circulation, composed of $991,500,000 in the reporting banks, and three or $400,000,000 in the pockets of the people, for the money in the \"reporting banks\" less their legal rese rves, is in circulation. Outside of the banks there is between $3 and $4 per capita in circulation and not $42.02 as they report it. It is utte rly impossible to have reasonable prices and wages and prosperity with such a limited volume. China has about $3 per capita, with the inevitable result that her mandarins are exceedingly rich and her peasantry exceeding poor. That is the objective of the \"Elders\" here in our"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"183 boasted \"land of the free.\" All of this ly ing and deception is in accordance with the \"law of our bank,\" viz: the protocols and the code of the communists. They say that we now have $5,469,400, 000 in circulation, or $42.02 per capi- ta. If that were true, which it is not, we clearly haven't enough, for it has been insufficient to lift us out of the depression. We are entitled to have enough money in circulation to do so. Is there any sane reason why this right is denied us? We now have $20,400,000,000 of gold and about $3,000,000,000 of silver stored in the United States Treasury vaults in Kentucky and elsewhere. Is there any sane reason why all or the greater pa rt of this money should not be paid into circulation? It would give us more than $150 per capita, restore values and prosperity to the country, and by so doing render useless and unnecessary the entire New Deal with its regimentation. We are like the miser who starves to death while fingering his money and counting it. It is beyond me to explain how it is po ssible for responsible treasury officials to make false reports as to the volume of money in circulation from year to year and administration to administration, and how Congress could be deceived by them. But it is obvious that such reports are false, that they are made knowing- ly and designedly, and that the memb ers of Congress and people generally have been deceived by them. The worst of it is they will not believe the truth even when such falsity is proven beyond controversy. It demonstrates, if dem- onstration is necessary, the mighty Rothschild power in our government, whether it be a democratic or a republican administration. The Jews have written several text books on political economy expounding what they call the \"qualitative theory of money\" in which they assert that gold is the only sound money because of its intrinsic value- If this doctrine is sound we should and would be the most prosperous people of the world because we have 80% of the gold of the world. Thirty years ago we had less than 10% and no dole, no unemployed and reasonable prices and wages and taxes. It is another Jewish lie, and propagated for the purpose of deception and in- jury. In protocol 5 they say: \"The science of political economy invented by our learned elders has for long past been giving royal prestige to capital.\" And so it has. And it has given us the go ld standard with its restricted volume of money and credit, and its attendant poverty and misery."},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"184 But they claim too much when they say \"the science of political economy\" was invented by their \"learned elders.\" The true science of money was first discov- ered by Adam Smith and John Stuart Mi ll, both of whom were Gentiles. The false qualitative theory was invented by the Jews because until recently they owned and controlled the greater part of the gold of the world and because the gold standard gave them the power to regulate the welfare and destiny of the people of the world. According to both Smith and Mill all values are fixed and determined by the quantity of money in circulation without re gard to its quality. It is the sole and only yard-stick of value. But the Jew economists dispute the truth of this fun- damental law, and in support of thei r argument point to the large volume which they falsely say we have in circulation, but which is not in circulation."},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"XXVI. MISMANAGED CURRENCY \"All people are chained down to he avy toil by poverty more firmly than ever they were chained by slavery and serfdom; from these, one way and another, they might free themselves, these could be settled with, but from want they will never get away.\"—From Pro- tocol 3. We now have what is called a \"managed currency system,\" with the Rothschild power doing the managing. Make no mistake about that. If it were possible for the people to do the managing the Rothschilds would not want that kind of system. We have had this system since the amendment to the Federal Reserve Act, which took away the right of the me mber banks to convert their \"eligible\" securities into currency, and invested the Federal Reserve Board with the dis- cretionary power to issue money. It is necessary to the success of this system that we have a limited quantity of money in circulation, otherwise they can't manage things; values will find their own level,—as they did prior to said amendment. With the exception of a few \"elder\"-ma nipulated panics, we had a prosperous country up to the date of the establishment of this \"managed currency\"; we have had the three worst disasters in the history of our country, since. It was the management of our currency system that brought them all about, and that has brought about our present deplorable condition. The worst of it is, they were all brought about designedly, including the present Roosevelt debacle. It is the Rothschild power that has controlled our financial policy and conse- quently the welfare of the American people since the Civil War. We call it \"Wall Street\" but \"Wall Street\" is only the representative of the Rothschild power. The part of it that is not Jewish is strongly pro-Jewish. Even if that were not true, no financier has ever yet dared to oppose the mighty Rothschild power, and no statesman has ever done so except Abraham Lincoln, and he was murdered. The \"Elders,\" with their press support, preach a \"managed currency,\" for that is what they want. Congress appears to be sold on it. The very capable and persistent Senator Thomas of Oklahoma had a bill calling for the creation of a \"monetary authority\" with directions to maintain the price and wage level of 1929. Mr. Eccles, Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, came out against it, arguing that it could not be done,—but it can be done, and he knows it."},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"186 It, however, will not be done by an authority that does not want to do it. Mr. Eccles does not want to do it because the Boss does not want it done; Eccles and his board brought the present disast er upon us because the Boss wanted it. The Boss has had this power for four years by virtue of a former Thomas bill,—known as the Thomas amendment, and has not used it except to further deflate, despite the fact that he has repeatedly said that he wanted to restore and maintain the price level of 1929. We have had enough of managed currency. If we had Jesus Christ to manage our money and establish our price level it might work satisfactorily,—but never with a bunch of Jews in control of it. No man or set of men, Jew or Gentile, are wise enough or good enough to manage our welfare. If Congress will only repeal the amendment establishing the managed curren- cy system and thereby restore the power to the member banks to discount their eligible paper without limit, the commerce and the people of the country will do all of the managing that is necessary. But a better plan still is to return to the system that prevailed before the estab- lishment of the Federal Reserve banks. Let Congress resume its constitutional duty to issue money and regulate its value; and let Congress cause to be issued and paid into general circulation $42.02 per capita or more. No man can justly complain of that,—not even the \"Elders,\" for they say it is now in circulation! I undertake to say that an average of $42.02 in the hand of the people will restore the price and wage level of 1920; that it will automatically do away with the A. A. A., the C. C. C, and all of the other new deal agencies; that it will re- store general prosperity to the people of our country, and it may preserve our constitutional government and rescue as from threatened sovietism. The remedy for our present unfortunate co ndition is so simple and so plain, that I marvel that our representatives in Congress do not see it and adopt it. They must know that the deflations of 19 20 and 1930 and 1937 were all caused by the management of the Federal Reserve System. The obvious remedy there- fore is to destroy this system or curtail its power to destroy us. This system brought about the three catastrophes mentioned, by the contrac- tion of currency and credit. The obviou s remedy therefore is to reverse the process and to expand the currency, which will carry with it an expansion of credit. Instead of adopting this remedy they have permitted the system to can- cel and withdraw from circulation the grea ter part of our gold and silver certif- icates and national bank notes; they have sterilized and buried all of our gold, and much of our silver."},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"187 the \"forgotten man.\" This repo   e true and reliable friends an f The first step toward recovery and toward peace, prosperity and happiness is to discard our mismanaged currency system; the second is to determine the price and wage level and the volume of circulating medium that the people need in order to pay their debts and taxes and be prosperous; third is to pay such volume into circulation, not in just New York and Chicago, but in such manner as it will reach the people throughout the length and breadth of the land; the fourth is to prohibit the ba nks and others from gathering in this money and cancelling it or hoarding it; the fifth is to check up on it from time to time and to issue additional currency when required, to take the place of money lost or destroyed or hoarded, and also to cover the increase in popula- tion and commerce. Sad to relate, Congress re-enacted the Thomas Amendment, extending it until June 15, 1941. This bill in substance extends the 2 billion stabilization fund and the authority to purchase gold and silver ad libitum, and empowers the President to issue and pay into circulation 6 billion dollars of money which he refuses to do. In substance it transfers to the President the sole and exclusive power to \"coin money and regulate its value,\" which is the sole and exclusive constitutional duty of Congress. It was the original purpose of the author of the bill, Senator Thomas, to get into circulation such additional volume of money as would restore prosperity to our stricken land,—as shown from his several speeches on the subject. But such has never been the purpose of the President, as shown from his ad- ministration of the measure. It was his purpose to prevent the issuance of such money by Congress, and the only sure way to do so was to get the power out of their hands and into his own. The Senate Committee on Agriculture an d Forestry filed an instructive re- port 48 pointing out the true and only remedy. The following are the members of the committee: Messrs. Smith (chairman), Wheeler, Thomas of Oklahoma, McGill, Bankhead, Bulow, Mrs. Caraway, Pope, Hatch, Bilbo, Moore, Schweilenbach, Gillette, Ellender, Norris, McNary, Capper, Frazier and Shipstead. The Committee is composed of ten Democrats, seven Republicans and two Independents. It has among its members some of the ablest men of Congress, whose long records of service have proven them to be th d champions of the \"under-privileged\" and o rt in substance says to the President of the 48 Congressional Record, 75th Congress, p. 625."},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"188 United States:—Your farm relief bill and your other relief measures are all unnecessary; we have alread y invested you with the power to restore prosperi- ty to the farmer and to all other classes of our people, and now it is up to you to do what we have authorized and instruct ed you to do. As to the devaluation of gold the Committee says: \"The first remedy applied was a monetary one—we went off gold and the dollar was devalued. In 2 months cotton went from 6.35 to 8.95 cents per pound, wheat from 45 to 75 cents, corn from 24 to 46 cents, and wool from 17 to 24 cents. Precisely the same ef- fects had been previously felt in other countries leaving the gold standard, particularly in great agricultural producing countries like Australia, the Argentine, Canada, New Zealand, and Den- mark. South Africa, the greatest gold producer in the world, went off gold because the pressure caused by staying on was too great for its agriculture.\" The further devaluation of gold will increase the export price of all commodi- ties, for the reason that it increases the supply of gold and thereby cheapens the medium of payment for our exports, but it will only incidentally affect do- mestic prices. To the extent that our home market for our own product is con- trolled by the foreign market, it will increase the price of such commodity here, but it will not mean a general increase of our prices and wages. In order to accomplish that end, money must be cheapened in our own country by getting more of it in circulation. The Committee calls the President's attention to the fact, which he already knew, that the Congress has already invested him with the power to increase prices and wages generally, and to restore employment and prosperity throughout the length and breadth of the land by \"(b) open the mints for the free coinage of silver; and (c) have issued additional treasury notes.\" The Pres- ident has had this power for the past four years and he has not used it. On the other hand he has employed every power granted him, with one single excep- tion, to further deflate and to thereby carry out the policy which was initiated during the Hoover Administration. The exception is the power granted him to devaluate gold, which he only partially employed. The delegation of such power to the President by Congress was in violation of Section 1, Art. 8, of the National Constitution, which imposes the duty upon Congress. The President sought this power, and Congress, relying upon his integrity and his good faith, granted it to him. It is evident that Congress would not have granted it except to be used, and it is also evident that the President did not seek it for that purpose. It is also evident that he sought and"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"189 obtained this delegation of power in order to \"head off\" Congress and to pre- vent Congress from relieving the countr y before he could \"put over\" his un- constitutional \"reforms.\" The Committee points out the true and only remedy, as follows: \"The power over the value of the dollar, now divided among vari- ous agencies and departments, public and private, should he coordinated and concentrated in one Federal agency with a defi- nite congressional mandate to such agency to properly adjust and regulate the value of the dollar and thereafter to stabilize it at such adjusted value.\" Note the language: — \"Congressional mandate to such agency to properly ad- just and regulate the value of the dollar and thereafter to stabilize it at such adjusted value.\" That is precisely what the President has so often said in his messages and speeches that he wanted and intended to do. He has said repeat- edly that he wanted to fix and adjust it at the 1926 price level, and to stabilize it at that level. And that is also precisely what he has had the power to do for more than four years, but has never yet done, nor taken an intelligent step in that direction. The report of this committee is so convincing and comprehensive that it de- serves to be published in full, but since I am endeavoring to be brief I give space only to the high points of it. The Committee adopts in part the report of its predecessor on the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933, as follows: \"We report these facts and state that no substantial relief is possi- ble for agriculture until the policy of deflation is not only checked but reversed and a substantial sum of actual money is admitted and, if need be, forced into circulation . . . \"We report further that no just, substantial, reliable, or perma- nent relief can be provided agriculture or any other industry until the money question is considered and adjusted.\""},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"190 The Committee then on its own behalf says: \"Now a new question has arisen, as follows: How cheap should the dollars be made and how high should prices be raised in order to serve the best interests of our people? \"While the dollar was being cheapened and prices were going up, prosperity increased and all we re happy. Since last March the dollar has increased in value from $1.13 to $1.19, causing prices to fall, unemployment to increase, depression to come again, and now business of all kinds has sl owed down and a new depression is threatened. \"In 1926, during the era of so-ca lled Coolidge prosperity, the dol- lar was valued in all commodities at 100 cents. In 1929, when the depression came upon the country, the value of the dollar had gone up to $1.05. Today, with much higher taxes and an almost doubled national debt, the dollar value is $1.19. \"The committee is of the opinion and reports that to date we have not cheapened the dollar sufficiently to raise the price level high enough to show sufficient profits upon which taxes are paid to balance the Budget. \"A high price level produces high commodity prices, high wages, high farm income, high national income, and consequently high tax income to the Treasury. A high price level produces happiness, progress and prosperity. (As true as gospel.) \"A low price level produces exactly the reverse results."},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"191 \"In 1919, with a high price level, we had incomes and values as follows: National income $69,000,000,000 Value of farm property 66,000,000,000 Value of farm income 13,000,000,000 Value of exports 8,200,000,000 Income to Treasury 6,007,000,000 \"In 1932, with a low price level, we had incomes and values as follows: National income $39,000,000,000 Value of farm property 3 6,000,000,000 Value of farm income 5 ,000,000,000 Value of exports 1,600,000,000 Income to Treasury 2 ,100,000,000 \"From the foregoing it is obvious that the price level has a control- ling influence upon our domestic economy. The record shows that from 1919 to 1929 we had a price level sufficiently high to permit of the collection of taxes in suffi cient sums to not only keep the Budget balanced but, in addition, to reduce the national debt in the sum of $1,000,000,000 per year. \"The committee is of the opinion and reports that the price level is now too low and recommends that ex isting powers be used and, if necessary, new legislation be enacted for the purpose, among oth- ers, of bringing about an increase in such price level to assist the farmers in securing parity prices for their products.\" With this clear conception of the one and only remedy by the President and these distinguished Senators, it is difficult to understand or explain why such remedy has not been employed. Indeed, I can find no explanation for it except in the Protocols. This does not imply that the members of this committee or a majority of the members of Congress are the puppets of the Elders. On the other hand I believe in the integrity of Congress as a whole, and in the loyalty and patriotism of this committee. They accepted the President's farm bill as being the best that they could get at this time. There are many excuses for the members of Congress that do not apply to the President. He and his Administration represent the leadership of the Demo- cratic Party. It is considered mutiny for the members of the party to refuse to"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"192 follow his leadership. The Republican Party is now so poorly represented in Congress that it can scarcely be called an opposition party. Moreover, there is the mighty power of the Jewish-owned press to be consi- dered. There is scarcely an editor or columnist who does no decry and ridicule inflation. Many of them do not know wh at it means, but they do know that their bosses are opposed to it and that they are expected to voice the views of their pay-check. Our members of Congress li ve, year in and year out, in a polit- ical atmosphere created by this \"kept\" pr ess. They are susceptible to its flattery and fear its ridicule. Let a congressman stand for the interest of the masses of the people and he is a dangerous demagogue and an irresponsible radical. Let him stand for the pro- gram of the \"Elders\" and he is a great and wise statesman and a profound economist. They have boosted Carter Gl ass so much that he himself has come to think that he is wise and virtuous and knows more about the money ques- tion than John Stuart Mill ever knew. The Elders have made the word \"infla- tion\" a by-word and a term of reproa ch. No congressman will dare confess himself an inflationist. He may not want to be called a deflationist, and he may be willing to be termed a reflat ionist, but never an inflationist. The Committee truly said in this report, and it took courage to say it in the Washington atmosphere, \"a high price level (inflation) produces happiness, progress, and prosperity; a low price level produces exactly the reverse re- sults.\" President Roosevelt and Barney Baruch know that is true. President Roosevelt has the power to create the \"high price level\"; he knows what to do, and how to do it,—but he refuses to act. He listens to Barney Baruch and his gang, the bunch that financed his cam- paign, and not to the voice of the people who elected him and who are represented by their congressmen and senators. Barney Baruch's entire argu- ment before the Senate Finance Committee was against inflation; he piously said that if inflation was the only remedy he would favor it, but he knew that it was not, that we had plenty of money waiting for employment and that all we need was \"confidence,\" and he proposed the \"new deal\" as being the true re- medy, outlining the program which the Roosevelt Administration has reli- giously followed up to this writing. Congress should either exercise its power to fix and regulate the value of the dollar, or repeal the 10% tax on state bank notes so that the States may do so. If this tax should be repealed each State could issue its own state bank curren- cy and thereby establish its own price leve l. This was the condition that existed prior to the war between the States."},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"XXVII. BANKRUPTCY \"Every kind of loan proves infirmity in the State and a want of understanding of the rights of the State. Loans hang like a sword of Damocles over the heads of rulers, who, instead of taking from their subjects by a temporary tax, come begging with outstretched palm of our bankers. Foreign loans are leeches which there is no possibility of removing from the body of the State until they fall off of themselves or the State flings them off. But the goyim States do not tear them off; they go on persisting in putting more on to themselves so that they must inevitably perish, drained by volun- tary bloodletting.\"— From Protocol 20. If the language of the President in his message to Congress of January 15, 1934, has any meaning at all, it means that the President clearly understands that the Federal government can establish any level of value for money, goods, and service that it desires, by the empl oyment of its sovereign power to issue money. Every man who has any knowledge of money knows that this is true. It means also that he recognizes that it is the \"high prerogative\" of government to issue and control the volume and value of money. It means also that he pro- posed to exercise this \"high prerogative\" and that he desired the necessary authority for that purpose. He has often expressed his purpose to restore the values of 1929, but has never yet taken an intelligent step in that direction. Congress enacted the legislation that he desired and recommended. He has been in supreme command for the past seven years. What has he done about it? Has the Federal Reserve System been overthrown or taken over by the gov- ernment? No. It still operates at the same old stand and in the same old way. Have the values of 1929 been restored and established upon the solid basis of an adequate volume of money? No, no, no; far from it. In pursuance of the President's messa ge Congress enacted the Connally bill devaluing gold to the extent of 40 per cent, which in terms of dollars increased our stock of gold correspondingly. If th is measure had been followed by the increase of currency to the same extent, it would have depreciated the value of money and increased the value of goods and service correspondingly. In other words, it would have increased wages and the value of all products and of all property approximately 40 per cent, and to about the 1929 level. But not one dollar of additional currency wa s put in circulation as a result of it. It did, however, increase the value of ou r export products that must be paid for"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"194 in gold or its equivalent. Congress also passed the Thomas bill which autho- rized the President to purchase silver and gold, and which sought to remonet- ize silver and thereby increase the volume of our circulating medium. The President was authorized by this act to purchase both gold and silver and to pay for the same with gold and silver certificates. We have bought the huge sum of $8,660,000,000 of gold at $35 an ounce within the past four years, principally from Great Britain and Russia. This gold was worth, prior to its devaluation, $20.67 an ounce. The premium that we have paid for it amounts to $3,500,000, 000. The reason we are getting all of it is the fact that we are paying the highest price for it. We are also getting large quantities, sent here for safe keepin g, by foreign banks and foreign Jews. The plan pursued is to sell U. S. bonds and thereby acquire the money to pur- chase the gold. This necessarily means that our good dollars are sent to Russia, Great Britain and other foreign countries in payment of their useless gold, and to that extent depletes our meager supply of dollars and their meager supply of gold. It should be remembered that this money although sent to foreign coun- tries, is counted by the Treasury Depart ment as being in circulation here and constitutes a part of our $42. 02 per capita circulation. The worst of this operation is that it has saddled the American people with a debt of $8,660,000,00 with an a nnual interest charge of about $200,000,000. If certificates had been issued against this gold as it was pur- chased and as was contemplated by Congress, the certificates and gold would offset each other, there would be no liability and no interest charge, and the gold would still be in circulation beca use the certificate holders could demand it. If certificates should now be issued against it we would have $8,660,000,000 of gold against which there would be $8,660,000,000 of bonds and $8,660,00000 of certificates and we would be out the huge sum of $8,660,000,000 plus interest. Moreover if certificates had been issued against the gold as purchased there would be that much more money in circul ation in the world, and world prices including our own would be higher, precisely to the same extent. As it is, the gold now lies dead and buried. It is of no earthly advantage to us or to the people of the world. The people of the world are poorer to that extent and we are poorer to the same extent plus $8 ,660,000,000 of bonds; and world prices are lower to precisely the same extent. Suppose we acquire substantially all of th e gold of the world, as appears to be the plan of this regime. Whether it is the plan or not, it is sure to happen if we continue to pay a 41 per cent premium. What then? Obviously we cannot sell"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"195 our excess products because the people of the world will have no money with which to buy them. Obviously we cannot sell our gold, for the same reason, and for the additional reason that most of the countries of the world already owe us debts that they cannot or will not pay. Gold must perforce be abandoned as a medium of international exchange and some other medium adopted or else the people of the world must resort to the primitive cumbersome method of barter and exchange of goods. Germany has already been forced to do th is very thing and she is doing it so successfully that her people are prosperous. Secretary Hull complains that she has thereby knocked out his reciprocal trade agreements;—a poor alibi is better than none. We have bought $1,642,000,000 of silver, issuing silver certificates therefore, which have gone into circulation in the countries from which the silver was bought, including our own. This is in accord with the intent of Congress and of the law, and this is precisely what should have been done in the purchase of gold. These silver certificates would have added to our circulating medium except for the fact that the Federal Reserve management withdrew and can- celled a corresponding volume of Federal Reserve notes. The net result of the operation of this law is to make a bad situation infinitely worse. We have got $8,660,000,000 of useless gold and issued and sold $8,660,000,000 of bonds that must be pa id by the toiling masses. We have $1,642,000,000 of silver certificates bu t no more money, since they have can- celled the same quantity of Federal Rese rve notes. In fact, we have less, for they have sent vast quantities of our money to England and other countries in payment of gold and silver. 49 This infamous stabilization-fund bill passed the House by a strict party vote; all of the Democrats voting for it and all of the Republicans against it. The party management of the two parties must have \"cracked the whip.\" It appears from the discussion that the Wall Street gang was on hand, as usual on money bills, urging the adoption of the bill. This means that the Rothschild power was behind the bill. If the Republicans had been in power the result would proba- bly have been the same, viz: all of th e Republicans would have voted for the bill and all of the Democrats against it . If the Rothschilds had needed a few Republican votes to pass the bill they would have found them.   49 See Congressional Record, 76th Congress, April 20 and 21 1939, Pages 6366‐8 and 6421‐5."},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"196 It is estimated that as a result of the administration of this Act we now have, dead and buried, \"sterilized\" if you please, the huge sum of about $20,400,000,000 of gold and that we are acquiring it at the rate of $3,276,000,000 per annum. There is left only $7,462,000,000 in the balance of the world. At the rate we are going we will get it all in about two years. What then? Besides this, there is or may be another $2,000,000,000 that Congress gave Morgenthau for the stabilization of foreign exchange. It has passed out of sight; the Lord only knows what he has done with it. He reports that he made $10,000,000 on the purchase of French fr ancs and kindred activities during his four years administration of the fund . If he had paid off government bonds instead of speculating with the fund he would have saved the taxpayers about $240,000,000 in interest. It was charge d that he clandestinely loaned the greater part of the fund to England an d France; and he very strenuously ob- jected to an audit of it. If all this money was resurrected and brought to life through putting it in cir- culation by the payment of government bonds or otherwise, it would not only reduce the national debt about $20, 000,000,000 but it would establish a home market for substantially all of our products, restore the full employment of labor, and restore values and the solvency of men and governments, would automatically do away with all of the plausible excuses for the New Deal and there would be no need for Morgenthau's stabilization fund. The late lamented Arthur Brisbane said of the burial of our cold: \"It is enough to make angels laugh to see men of South Africa digging gold out of a hole, and Americans buying and burying the same gold in a hole!\" The President is now proposing to increase the national debt limit from $45,000,000,000 to $49,000,000,000 and to levy additional taxes. His chief aims have been from the beginning to create more debt and levy more taxes and bankrupt the country and he has pursued these aims consistently from the very beginning. Our national indebtedness, funded and unfunded, and includ- ing appropriations is now more than $70,000,000,000 and it is being in- creased at a very rapid rate.

With the exception of the administration of President Wilson the total expenditures of our govern- ment from its beginning in 1776 up to the \"Jew Deal\" have been only $55,265,107,000.

This does not in- clude the money recently authorized for alleged defense purposes amounting to about $17,000,000,000. President Roosevelt and the Jew kept press and the Jew columnists are now whooping up a war scare. They have already stampeded Congress into autho- rizing about $7,000,000,000 for armament s when we are now in less danger of invasion by a foreign foe than in the past thirty years. Our most promising prospect is Japan, but she is busy in China and will be exhausted by the time she gets through with that job. Germany is not even a remote prospect, for she is no longer ruled by Jews. Germany, even if she conquers Britain, will likely create a United States of Europe, which they said was their objective. It will be less aggressive than a United States of Europe under Jewish control for the German people are an industrious, home-loving, peaceful people, who acquire wealth by creating it, and not by manipulation of currencies and markets, as do the Jews. Germany has never acquired or sought to ac quire a foot of soil in our country, as have both Britain and France. She could not be more of a bully as mistress of the seas than Great Britain has proven herself to be. Great Britain has, in flagrant violation of international law, declared a block- ade of the entire world, from the Arctic Circle to Africa, to prevent the possibil- ity of supplies reaching Germany. She has announced that she would not even allow the shipment of food to the famine-stricken people of Europe. This is all manufactured war hysteria for the purp oses of getting more money to be squandered, and of bankrupting our countr y and of creating a dictatorship of the proletariat and of continuing Franklin D. Roosevelt in office as our dicta- tor. It is either for these purposes or for intervention in the present war. IT IS NOT FOR DEFENSE. Our national government and many of our city governments are now bank- rupt. They have reached their limit of ta xation. Real estate has become more of a liability than an asset and much of it has been sold for taxes. The national government has levied a heavy income tax on undistributed profits which is stifling small industries, retarding the expansion of the large ones, and discou- raging the creation of new ones. And now they have made a flat increase of the rate that will crush many of the small industries. But few people care to invest in a new industry, assuming all the risk of loss if it is a failure, when the gov- ernment will get most of the profits if it is a success."},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"198 President Roosevelt stated the situation that prevailed at the time of his elec- tion, on page 62 of his book \"On Our Way,\" as follows: \"In talking with people about our basic economic troubles I have often drawn for them a picture showing two columns, one representing what the United States was worth in terms of dollars and the other representing what the United States owed in terms of dollars. The figure covered al l property and all debts, public, corporate and individual. In 1929, the total of the assets in terms of dollars was much larger than the total of the debts. But, by the spring of 1933 while the total of the debts was still just as great, the total of the assets had shrunk to below that of the debts. \"Two courses were open: to cut down the debts through bank- ruptcies and foreclosures to such a point that they would be below property values; or else to increase property values until they were greater than the debts. Obviously, the latter course was the only legitimate method of puttin g the country back on its feet without destroying human values.\" That condition is infinitely worse today. There has been no increase of our property values, but there has been a ve ry great increase in our debts and tax- es. Our situation is now more critical than ever before in the history of our country. Our national wealth is no w estimated at about $250,000,000,000, which is too high, and our aggregate de bts are estimated at about the same figure. We are insolvent and on the brink of a debacle. This is all in accord with the protocols and the code of the communists; \"the law of our bank.\" The only remedy is the cancellation of all bonds and mortgage debts. This can be done either by inflation or by law. The former is the method adopted by the Jews when they were in control of the German government, is the less painful, and therefore the best. The protocol quoted above says in substance that \"debts are leeches\" but that we haven't sense enough to \"tear them off;\" that if we do not do so we will \"inevitably perish by voluntary bloodletting.\" The lat- ter statement is true, but let us hope that we do have sense enough to \"tear off the leeches\" before it is too late to save ourselves and our government. It is but just that these bonds and mortgages should be cancelled. They are owned largely by the Rothschild and ot her Jew institutions.

Our power is in the chronic shortness of food and physical weakness of the worker because by all that this implies he is made the slave of our will, and he will not find in his own authorities either strength or energy to set against our will. Hunger creates the right of capital to rule the worker more surely than it was given the aristocracy by the legal authori- ty of kings.

Why should the President do these wicked and terrible things to us, his trust- ing friends? Why such evil designs, and why does he pursue them so ruthlessly and so relentlessly? Why, oh why, does he preach the right remedy and adopt the wrong one? If the Protocols and the designs of the Elders are not the an- swer, then what is it? I can find but one answer, namely, the Protocols, and the program of the Eld- ers who financed his campaign and brought about his nomination for the pres- idency. They want a dictatorship and must have it in order to destroy our gov- ernment and to establish their kingdom. A contented, happy people will not tolerate war except as a defensive me asure, but a poverty stricken, discon- tented, restless people are ready for any change.

In his message to Congress, Jan. 3, 1940, the President said: \"You are well aware that Dictatorships have originated in almost every case in the necessity for dr astic action to improve internal conditions where democratic action has failed to respond to mod- ern demands.\" There are two routes to a dictatorship: one is poverty and despair and the oth- er is war. The war road led to the dictat orship of Stalin and the very recent one of Winston Churchill; and the poverty route to the dictatorships of Hitler and Mussolini. President Roosevelt has been pursuing both routes. He and the \"kept\" press have neglected no opportunities to create a war sentiment and at the same time he has been diligently and relentlessly paving the way for a dictatorship of the proletariat through poverty and di stress. There may be some relief from it for a short period of time because of the huge expenditure on government armaments but the underlying conditions remain and our escape will only be temporary. Sooner or later there will be a revolt of such proportions in the form of strikes or otherwise as will enable the President to declare an emer- gency and himself as dictator. The following is a comparative statement of the value of our money with that of other leading commercial nations: FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES (Value of foreign currencies in terms of dollars and cents)    1929 1940 England (pound) $4.86 $3.15 France (franc) 039 .17 3/4 Canada (dollar) 99 .7880 A rgentina (peso) 95 .2260 Mexico (peso) 48 .1690 Japan (yen) 46 .2348"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"203 The 1929 column represents the comparative values when we had reasonably high prices and wages and a reasonable degree of prosperity. The 1940 column represents the value when we have low prices and wages and 10,000,000 un- employed men. The explanation is simple. It will be observed that our dollar is more than double the value of most foreign currencies. This ne cessarily means that the foreigner must pay $2 of his money to buy $1 of our products as measured by our money. It means also that he will buy from other countries that can supply him with the same products whose money is near a parity with his own and where he will not be required to pay this premium. Conversely it means that the Jewish importers—and practically all of them are Jews—can buy $2 of foreign goods with $1 of our money. It means also that the foreign manufacturer can manufacture his goods at approximately half the cost of ours because he pays for his raw material, labor, taxes, etc., with cheap- er money. It means also that the importer can sell the imported article at a less price than it can be produced in this country. To illustrate further: With wheat at $1 per bushel a Canadian dollar would have bought one bushel of our wheat in 1929, it will now buy slightly more than three-fourths of a bushel; two Mexican pesos would have bought practi- cally a bushel, it now requires six pesos; an Argentina peso would have bought a bushel, it now takes four; two Japanese yen would have then bought a bu- shel, it now takes four. The worst of it is that these two Japanese yen could in 1929 have bought a bushel of Argentine wheat, but now they can buy four bu- shels, which means that they will buy Argentine wheat in preference to ours. Congress extended the life of the Hull re ciprocal trade program by a strict par- ty vote; a majority of the democrats voting for the extension and all the repub- licans against it. This means that the American producer cannot have the ad- vantage of even his home market. It al so necessarily means his bankruptcy and the unemployment of labor. These two New Deal policies taken together will drive the final spikes in the coffin of the American producer, whether farmer or manufacturer. They are fine things for the comparatively few Jewish impor- ters, but they will complete the ruin and destruction of the American farmer, industrialists and laborers. They pave th e way for the dictatorship of the prole- tariat, and they were intended for that purpose. The following lines from an unknown author describe present conditions:"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"204 \"Mr. Roosevelt is my shepherd And I am in want; He maketh me to lie down on park benches, He leadeth me beside still factories, He disturbeth my soul. He leadeth me in the paths of destitution for his party's sake. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of the depres- sion, I anticipate no recovery , for he is with me; His policies, his diplomacies, they frighten me; He prepareth a reduction in my income, And in the presence of mine enemies He anointeth my small income with taxes. My expenses runneth over,— Surely, unemployment, want, and po verty shall follow me all the days of my life. And I shall dwell in a mortgaged home forever.\" It is likely that the reciprocal trade agreements will not prove to be as injurious as they were intended to be. Der Fuehrer has cancelled by conquest the agree- ments negotiated with France, Belgium, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Holland, and Luxembourg. No matter what the outcome may be the ominous fact is that we now have, and will in the future have, a very limited market for our surplus products, for three reasons: (1) We have alienated most of the countries of Europe and Asia by boycotts and threats of war; (2) they have no gold or American dollars with which to pay; (3) they will be forced to adopt and will adopt a different curren- cy system that will render our hoarded gold useless. Dorothy Thompson stated in one of her syndicated articles that Hitler plans to establish the \"United States of Europe,\" to destroy tariff barriers and to create an independent cur- rency system. It is the logical result of our ownership of 80% of the gold of the world. There are also two kinds of dictatorship s: the one of the Gentile called \"fasc- ist,\" such as the dictatorships of Italy and Germany which were brought about to preserve law and order and the righ ts of property, and as a protection against the usurpation of the commune. The other, the dictatorship of the Jew, called \"communism,\" such as that of Russia, and more recently of England. The latter is a destructive type of dictatorship,—destructive of law, religion, and freedom, and accompanied by all fo rms of lawlessness and murder; the latter is Semitic, the former is anti-Semitic."},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"205 The excuse for Churchill's dictatorship was the Norway disaster, but it was only an excuse, for Churchill himself was responsible for the disaster and not Chamberlain. The Churchil l appointment precipitated the attack on Holland and Belgium which may result in the destruction of the British Empire, but Churchill will continue as dictator despite the disaster, so long as the Jews can keep him there. He has faithfully followed the program of Stalin. His first act was to imprison all anti-Semitics, classing them as \"Fifth Columnists,\" and now he has provided for the death penalty for them. The last report we have is that they are secretly trying Sir Oswald Mosely, which means that he will be convicted and condemned to death; otherwise there would be no occasion for secrecy. Under the pretense of meeting a grave emergency, viz: a threatened invasion by Germany, President Roosevelt sent a message to congress asking that the bond limit be increased and that addi tional taxes be imposed. Congressman Andrew Anderson of Minnesota naively observed that this is the sixty-third emergency that has confronted this administration. The President told Congress in substance to enact this legislation and turn the money over to him to spend and then adjourn and go home; that they couldn't do anything but talk and that they might be in his way. A subservient Congress has already increased the income tax a flat 10%, and provided for a large in- crease of the tax rate of the little taxp ayer, and a small increase of the big one, and they have voted to increase the bond limit from 45 to 49 billion dollars. But the republicans have led a revolt against adjournment and it has been postponed for a time at least. Germany financed the building of the greatest mechanized war machine in the history of the world without gold and without bonds. With 80% of the gold in the world and the greatest resources of any country, Mr. Roosevelt must have $4,000,000,000 of bonds and an approxim ate 40% increase in income taxes in order to even make a start. What the bonds and taxes will be by the time he is through no man can foresee. He has not yet even made a suggestion to ligh- ten the tax burden by cheapening the dollar. He is not likely to do so for the simple reason that such act would automatically abolish his W. P. A. and other hand-outs, jeopardize his campaign fu nd and his dictatorship prospects. The Wilson administration financed the last war, plus the gifts to the Allies of about $15,000,000,000, with bonds. This was wholly unnecessary and a co- lossal crime against the American people but we can give that Administration credit for a little breathing spell of ab out eighteen months of cheap money. Mr. Roosevelt does not propose to give us any respite whatever. His evident pur-"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"206 pose is to hold our \"feet to the fire\" until we are ready to concede him all the power he covets. As desperate as our financial situation is now, this Administration can finance the whole armament program by simply cheapening the dollar. Mr. Roosevelt knows that this is true, and many member s of Congress know it is true. We can pay the bonded indebtedness of $45,000,000,000 plus $10,000,000,000 for armaments with gold certificates having a 40 % gold reserve, which according to all of the orthodox authorities is more than sufficient. Such act would afford instant and complete relief to all of the impoverished people of this stricken land, for it would cheapen money to the extent that they could pay their debts and taxes. All of the pending bills will place the burden on the poor who do not want war but who must do the fighting. The cheapening of money would put it on the rich, many of whom want war and will profit by it, and few of whom will do any fighting. Unfortunately, the richest of them will escape taxes in any event through their ownership of government tax-exempt bonds and their stock- selling devices. And now the President proposes that the R. F. C. be authorized to lend the South American countries $500,000,000 against the products of their farms and ranches in order to impound them and to keep them from being sold to Germany. This is just a starter; it is only a white chip. It will require many times that amount and then the scheme will be a failure. The people of the several countries of South America will not sell us their products unless it is to their advantage to do so. That is a cinch. Germany can and will pay more for them than we can affo rd to pay. That is also a cinch. It is true we have more gold than Germany, but Germany can manufacturer goods cheaper than we can. That is another ci nch. In the last analysis international trade is an exchange of goods. Gold is only the medium of affecting such ex- change. Germany has no bonded indebtedness and we are mortgaged up to the limit \"and then some.\" Our national, state and city governments and our railroads, farms and industries are heavily mortgaged and these mortgages must be paid in interest and taxes. About one-half of our cost of production is composed of interest and taxes. We can't compete with the producers of a country that is free of such burden. We must cancel ou r debts or we perish. We must free the people from the slavery of debt. There is no other way."},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"XXIX. AMERICA ENTERS THE WAR \"In a word, to sum up our system of keeping the government of the goyim in Europe in check, we shall show our strength to one of them by terrorist attempts and to all, if we allow the possibility of a general rising against us, we shall respond with the guns of America or China or Japan.\" —From Protocol 7. The President has at last inveigled us into war. Without authority from Con- gress and with Congress in session, he authorized the War Department to transfer vast quantities of our arms, munitions, and war equipment to private corporations for the express purpose of being re-sold by them to the Allies, and thereby evading the law. This was done in order to avoid the agreements of the Hague convention of 1907 and the United States Neutrality Act of 1918 which made it illegal for a nation not at war \"to furnish any belligerent with troops, ships, munitions of war, money, or with commodities of direct or indi- rect use in war.\" These laws apply to nations and not to individuals, and hence this miserable subterfuge. A few days later, to-wit: on June 10, 19 40, President Roosevelt said in a speech at Charlottesville, Va., \"We will extend to the opponents of force (the Allies) the material resources of this nation.\" He thus boldly proclaimed that he would do openly what he first sought to do by indirection and subterfuge. In flagrant disregard of international law and of our own solemn treaty and of our own neutrality law, he pledged without limit the resources of this nation to the Allies. This includes arms, munitions, money, ships, food and supplies of every kind and character that may be required. It means that he has on behalf of our nation, assumed the burden of supporting the war of England when we our- selves are on the verge of bankruptcy, if not bankrupt. In its ultimate consequences it means much more than that. General Hugh S. Johnson said of the first clandestine tran sfer of our war supplies: \"This is no action short of war. It is war. In defiance of Congress and of the constitution the President by a slick trick . . . has committed us to war.\" And now he has the cold nerve to boastfully proclaim it to the world. The next step will be to send our ships with munitions and supplies and convoys to the Allies; and the next will be our soldiers; and then as surely as night follows the day, the next will be the destruction of our government, the loss of our liberties, and a dictatorship. A few days later Roosevelt said in resp onse to an appeal from Premier Rey- naud for more help, that he was \"doing everything he could for them and that"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"208 he would continue to do so as long as they would hold out; but that Congress alone had authority to declare war.\" This promise plainly encouraged them to fight to the bitter end, and told them that they can depend on him for every- thing in his power, except a declaratio n of war, for the reason that he was without that authority. Mr. Churchill explained this appeal to the House of Commons in a speech a few days later. He said that when Reyn aud informed him that it would be ne- cessary for France to surrender, he ad vised Reynaud to appeal to President Roosevelt to now enter the war. What right had either of them to assume that Roosevelt would declare war on their request? Reynaud did appeal and when Roosevelt said he could do no more at this time but advised him to continue the fight,—then it was that France su rrendered. Paul Reynaud and his backer, Georges Mandel (Jeroboam Rothschild) then fled the country to escape the wrath of an outraged and deeply injured people. Now Britain is facing certain defeat with great destruction of life and property. Churchill, Duff-Cooper and Anthony Eden have repeatedly spoken to the Eng- lish people over the radio in order to allay their fears and resentment. They have promised them that America would soon actively join them and have encouraged them to fight until this help arrives. Why all of this reliance on America if there has been no promise of help? It all goes back to the peaceful settlement at Munich when Roosevelt led the chorus of \"never another Munich.\" It goes back to the pledges of Bullitt and Kennedy to Poland, France, and England. The radio commentator, Edwin C. Hill, stated that Roosevelt actually con- ferred with a few of his friends about himself declaring war, with Congress in session! They no doubt advised against it, and wisely so. \"Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed, That he is grown so great?\" Congress is now at last evidently afraid of him, for after having tentatively agreed to adjourn on June 22nd the decision was revoked. We are now at war with Germany and Italy. This war may be extended later to Japan and Spain. Russia may keep out of it in order to be better prepared to administer upon the wreckage when the warring countries are exhausted. We now have in prospect the universal war for which the \"Learned Elders of Zion\" have been scheming and working since they failed to establish their Super-"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"209 Government through the League of Nation s. It may result in the kingdom of the \"Despot of the blood of Zion\" with Roosevelt or Jeroboam Rothschild as such \"King-Despot.\" The President has already practically ass umed the office of dictator, with only an occasional protest from Congress. He has led us into war, with Congress in session, and despite the recent assurances of the majority of the members of Congress that under no circumstances wo uld they permit our country to be- come involved in the present war except for defense upon our own shores. It was recently reported in the press that a contract had been made with the Ford Motor Company to manufacture airp lane engines for the British Empire and America. Mr. Henry Ford denied the report. He said that his company was willing to make these engines for the defense of America but not for the prose- cution of the war by the British. Mr. Knudsen, on behalf of the \"Council for National Defense,\" answered that the contract involved making engines for both governments, and the Committee cancelled the contract because of Mr. Ford's refusal to manufacture engines for the British Empire. This controversy reveals the following facts: (1) That our alleged \"Council for National Defense\" is now engaged in buying war equipment for the British Government; (2) that they are more interested in buying for the British Gov- ernment than for ourselves; (3) that they are making these purchases for the joint account of the United States and the British Governments; (4) it is a fair inference from these facts, that this Committee will make payment for this equipment out of the $5,000,000,000 fund that Congress has provided for that purpose. Thus it appears that we are being taxed to the point of confisca- tion of property, to support the tottering British Empire and the Rothschild family fortune. We are in. Make no mistake about that. And we will stay in until our govern- ment is destroyed, if Franklin D. Roosevelt is continued in office. And we are not in for the defense of our countr y; we are in for its destruction. It is now reasonably clear that England will soon be taken by the Germans,— but that may not end the war. It would end it except for our intervention. It was Churchill himself who said that we did the Allies more harm than good in the last war, because by entering it we delayed the peace for two years. He criticized us for then doing what he no w begs us to do. Our entering the war would now do the people of the British Empire more harm than good, for many of them and their possessions will be destroyed if the war is prolonged."},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"210 The Senate Naval Affairs Committee, of which Senator David Walsh of Massa- chusetts is chairman, investigated th e rumor that our government had trans- ferred 23 of our war vessels to Great Britain. Mr. Lewis Compton, acting Secre- tary of the Navy, at first denied that such transfer had been made, but later admitted it; he admitted also that th e vessels were not obsolete, and his own responsibility. When the President was advised of this, he contradicted Mr. Compton and informed the committee that he alone was responsible for the transfer. This was probably done in or der to prevent further investigation and to save further disclosures. This transfer is in plain violation of Chap . 30 Title V 3, 40 Stat. 222, U. S. C. A., which prohibits the transfer of a war ve ssel to a belligerent nation. The Presi- dent again violated the law by giving Britain 50 of our destroyers with their guns and ammunition and that cost us more than $100,000,000.00,—as pro- posed by \"Sir\" John Pershing—This was a pretended exchange for air bases, at first denied but later justified on the ground that it was a good trade. The con- sideration paid for these 99-year leases of a few thousand acres of cheap land is so grossly exorbitant that it can only be considered a gift and an under-cover entry into the war. This was done by our dictator without the consent of Con- gress, and with Congress in session. It is either a flagrant violation of our own law; punishable by fine and imprisonment, or it is war. If we are in fact en- gaged in war with Germany and Italy it is legal and defensible, otherwise it is not. It is evidently intended by the President as an under-cover, back-door entry into the war. Mr. Churchill recently stated in a sp eech in the House of Commons that in case Hitler invaded and conquered England that the government would move to Canada and with our help they would continue the fight. In anticipation of such contingency the President made a trip to Canada a few years ago and there made a speech in which he assured the Canadians that the United States would extend the Monroe Doctrine to Canada and would protect them. This was an unprecedented and unwarranted and unauthorized extension of the Monroe Doctrine. It was never intended to apply to any part of the British Empire, but only to the weak and defenseless countries of South America. It was to prevent future foreign absorption of South America. When this doctrine was first announced Canada was a part of the British Empire and was accepted as such. It is obvious that this assurance on the part of the President was a premedi- tated one, in pursuance of a carefully premeditated plan, and in anticipation of the war that the \"Elders\" then planned and that we now have. They \"planned it that way.\""},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"211 They have been preparing the ground for this war for many years. It is evident that Mr. Roosevelt has participated in th is conspiracy. That is the explanation of the New Deal with all of its regimentation, the purchase of the gold and silver of the world, the stabilization fund, the extension of the Monroe Doc- trine, and of his frantic desire to get us into the war. If Mr. Hitler is the blood-thirsty, ambitious villain that the Jew press represent him to be, he will declare war on us and he will do it now while we are unpre- pared and unarmed. He will not wait two or three years until we can gear up our industries and replenis h our depleted war equipment. He has more sense than that; he will do it now while he is ready and we are not. The Mexican government is a vacillating unreliable one that is sometimes friendly to us and sometimes not, according to their interest of the moment; the same is true of Brazil. Offered sufficient inducement, either of them will turn against us. President Vargas recent ly made a speech in which he in sub- stance welcomed the new order that would accompany German victory and would supplant the decaying civilization of Britain and France, as he described them. He may be right about it, for they both have the \"Jew-rot,\" which is a combina- tion of graft, bribery, and of great weal th and great poverty. Their inefficiency in war is due primarily to this disease. We suffer from the same cancerous disease gnawing at our vitals, and we will suffer the same fate if we do not eradicate the germs of it. It is at least a possibility that Brazil wi ll welcome Hitler. In that case, what will become of the steel plant we propose, a ccording to press reports, to build in that country? (Ostensibly, of course, as a defensive measure.) There is now pending in Congress a bill with administ ration support, to enlarge the powers of the R. F. C. in order to enable it to furnish the required capital. There ap- pears to be no constitutional limitation whatever upon the activities of this vicious administration of our government and of this vicious corporation. It is at least debatable whether we are justified in going to war to enforce the Monroe Doctrine, and particularly to prot ect a state that does not ask or want our protection. If it is our fixed policy to enforce this doctrine then we should ourselves respect it. The Monroe Doctrine demands America for Americans.—but concedes Europe for Europeans and Asia for Asiatics. That is the present position of Japan and Germany and Italy. Japan proposes to en force it in Asia; Hitler and Mussolini in Europe.

The people of these countries can solve their own problems in their own way, as they have heretofore done,—without our help. Our position should continue to be—a s it has always been into main- tain friendly relations with what ever governments they establish. It must be conceded that both Hitler and Mussolini have ample provocation for war. The President has called them names and made faces at them. He said of Mussolini that he was an assassin wh o \"stabbed his neighbor in the back,\"— but if he had declared himself on the side of the Allies he would have had the benedictions of the President. It is not incumbent on them to declare war on us, for we first begun war on them by pledging our unlimited support to the Allies. Mr. Roosevelt declared an econom ic war on Germany more than a year ago by his boycott; and challenged Hitler to arms by withdrawing our Ambas- sador. I do not believe that Hitler wants to make war on us or wants anything on this side of the Atlantic Ocean. He certainly does not want our Jews, and he has managed to get along very well without our gold. If we should make the mis- take of reelecting Roosevelt for a third term, he may construe this as a ratifica- tion of Roosevelt's war-like demonstrat ions and he may conclude that war is inevitable sooner or later. In that case he may accept Mr. Roosevelt's challenge and wage it while we are unprepared. No matter what opinion we may have of Mr. Hitler, we must concede that he has been forced into this war; that he was ready to make peace on the basis of restoring to Germany the territory wrongfully taken from her by the peace treaty; and that he has conducted the war according to the rules of civilized warfare. Mr. Hitler has stated on many occasions that this war is primarily with the Jews, whom he holds responsible for it. They have now been overthrown in all of the countries of Europe except England, their ancient stronghold. They are now fleeing to this country from all of Europe and our Jew adminis- tration has, in violation of law, opened wide our ports to them. They expect to continue their war from here. They have already responded with \"the guns of America\" and they are working over-time to get our boys into it.

Why have we entered this destructive war upon the losing side? War involves great sacrifice and suffering. It is neve r justified except for self-defense. The warmongers seek to justify it upon that ground. They tell us that the British navy is our first line of defense. It ha s never been so used, and neither we nor Great Britain have so regarded it heretofo re. But even if that were true it would be far cheaper and more dependable for us to provide our own navy. That is precisely what the government is now proposing to do and for which it has authorized immense appropriations. If our own country is in danger of attack the place to defend it is in our own waters and on our own shores and not in foreign waters and on foreign shores. On June 10, 1940, there was published in all the leading newspapers of the country a full page advertisement over the signatures of about thirty well known Americans, headed by William Al len White of Emporia, Kansas, with the flaring headline, \"Stop Hitler Now.\" It was followed by an argument advo- cating our immediate entry into the war. According the press reports, Mr. Roosevelt read the advertisement \"and found it to be a great piece of work and extremely educational for the people of the country.\" Yes, a \"great piece of work and extremely educational\" for war. This advertisement was paid for by the Rothschild banks of Morgan & Co., Kuhn, Loeb & Co-, and their affili- ates. 50 There are very obvious reasons why \"our bank\" would like to get America into war. Until recently the argument was made that we should enter the war on behalf of France because she helped us in our war for independence against Great Britain.

This argument, however, no longer obtains, since England is now at war with France. False Albion treacherously turned upon her former ally, France, and destroyed many of her ships and killed more than 1200 of her seamen. The battle, if it may be so dignified, is thus described by the magazine \"Time\": \"In the night of July 2-3 (1940) at various ports of England and Scotland, armed parties of British officers and men quietly boarded all major French ships be rthed with the home fleet, most- ly at Portsmouth and Plymouth.\" They were not able to do this at Oran, which is in French waters, and so they slipped up in the night and mined the waters around the French ships while they were riding peacefully and unsu spectingly at anchor. The British com- mander then demanded their surrender and upon being refused opened up a murderous fire without warning that destroyed and damaged a number of French ships and killed 1200 men. The British sustained no losses for the rea- son that the French did not expect an attack by their former ally, their ships were not steamed up and consequently th ey were in no position to maneuver their guns and to fight. This was another great British victory (? ) and so hailed by the Jew press of England and America. It was another Altmark victory. The only two British victories in this war to date have been against an unarmed foe and in violation of the rules of civilized warfare. No savage would have attacked a prostrate friend without provocation. French Foreign Minister Baudouin said of it: \"Mr. Churchill is guilty of an act of aggression, which is without precedent in the history of the world;\" that Britain \"must shoulder the blame for the loss of the war for she selfishly thought of the defense of the British Isles and provided only a minimum mili- tary aid to France.\" He later stated that France had furnished three million men and Britain only two hundred thousand. Baudouin said further that \"the British saved four-fifths of their troops from Flanders, embarking them from Dunkerque, while the French lost half of their forces; that the British furnished only 14,000 troops for rear guard operation and the rest of the 200,000 were French.\" He might have added that the French lost 1,900,000 men in killed, in jured and prisoners, which is nine times the number of soldiers furnished by Britain, and more than forty times British casualties."},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"215 ement w   e war on Germany if she (G And now the British have several French ships bottled up in the French Marti- nique port.

Why should we turn against the country that helped us win our independence? A little while ago it was said we owed it to France and to LaFayette to help her. And now she is our enemy? Why? Can it be because the French government refused to allow the city of Paris to be destroyed in order to get us into the war? Can it be because France surrendered after the loss of two-thirds of her army? No, no. These are not the reasons. Whatever the true reason may be we have not entered this war to help France. We do not yet know the whole truth about all of this war propaganda and the President's activities to involve us in the war, but some of it has come to light. When Germany captured Warsaw, the capital of Poland, she also captured the official archives, and among them a transcript of the negotiations between our government and the Polish government leading up to the war. It appears therefrom that our ambassador to France, the Jew Bullitt,—just before sailing for Paris \"with a whole trunk full of instruments and conversa- tions and directions from President Roosevelt and the State Department and senators who belonged to the Committee on Foreign Affairs,\"—held a confe- rence with the Polish Ambassador (to the U.

It is the decided opinion of the President that France and Brit- ain must put an end to any sort of compromise with the totalita- rian countries. They must not let themselves in for any discussions aiming at any kind of territorial changes. \"4. They have the moral assurance that the United States will leave the policy of isolation and be prepared to intervene actively on the side of Britain and France in case of war. America is ready to place its whole wealth of mone y and raw materials at their dis- posal.\" 51 It appears further from these official notes that the President was quite urgent that Poland should reject Germany's de mand for return of the Danzig Corridor and that Britain and France should support Poland in this position and should declar ermany) undertook to take it by force.

Thus it appears that President Roosevelt is himself primarily responsible for the war. We can now understand why Reynaud on Churchill's advice, issued his distress call to Roosevelt to come in. We can see why the President said in substance in reply: fight on to the end; I am doing everything I can. This explains also the speeches that are being made from time to time by Churchill, Duff-Cooper and Eden, encouraging the people of England to con- tinue the fight on the ground that the United States will later enter the war. It explains their oftrepeated published statement that this is our war and that they are fighting it for us. It is not our war. It is the war of our Jews, of French Jews, and British Jews. The French Jews have been overthrown and have fled the country. The British Jews are still in power, and so are ours. It is a war to save the Jew Empire and the gold standard and to destroy our gove rnment and to enslave us. It is a war to establish the \"King despot of the blood of Zion.\" England can make peace now without the immense destruction of life and property that will soon fol- low, but she cannot save the Jewish empire. It is doomed. Nor can we save it. Roosevelt is still working feverishly to that end but the result here will be what it has been in Europe. They have not yet initiated po- groms in Europe but the people of Fr ance, Hungary, Romania and Spain have disfranchised the Jews, barred them from holding office, and from their news- paper activities. That must be done here. If it is not done the activities of the President and his Jewish administration will bring upon us the death and de- struction that he has already caused in Europe. Our imperial President is now organizi ng us and the western hemisphere for war. Our new Secretary of War Stimson is endeavoring to ramrod a compul- sory conscription bill through Congress that will involve an additional esti- mated annual expense of $1,100,000,000. Suppose we now had one million trained soldiers fully armed and equipped and a powerful two-ocean navy, does anyone doubt for a moment that we would be up to our ears in this war? There are but two things that will keep us out when we are fully prepared: one is Roosevelt's defeat; the other that the war will be over."},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"217 The war would now be over but for the interference of President Roosevelt. He is now telling Churchill the same story he told Reynaud: \"fight on, I am doing all I can.\" They would not continue this losing fight except for the fact that both of our presidential candidates are committed to war and we are making preparations to get into it at the earliest possible moment. England will likely soon surrender but the Churchill plan is to remove the Brit- ish government to Canada and to continue the fight from there. The President is now seeking to line up the South American countries in order to mobilize a solid western hemisphere front against Europe and Asia, and to do so is offer- ing them $500,000,000 in some concealed form as a token of good faith. They appear to be suspicious of him,—and with good cause. The Argentine representative, Mr. Melo, expressed opposition to \"sacrificing his country's jurisdictional principles.\" He said very properly that the question of the disposition of the French and other islands should be left to the people of such islands and that the United States and the South American countries had no right to assume a \"collective trus teeship\" over them. He said also,—and congress should take note of it—that the \"proper time to cross a bridge is when it is reached,\" and that no action shou ld be taken which is \"based on a mere hypothesis.\" A face-saving compromise was finally ag reed upon which was signed by Mex- ico, Chile, Bolivia, Colombia, Venezuela, Peru, and Argentina, subject to the approval of their respective legislative bodies. Interpreted, it means that if they hereafter find it to their advantage to work with the United States they will do so, otherwise they will not. It means precisely nothing; the conference was a fizzle. But that small circumstance does not restrain the Administration. Mr. Roosevelt still insists in flagrant violation of our national constitution that congress authorize the Export- Import Bank to lend the South American coun- tries $500,000,000 which they will no do ubt accept and which we will likely lose. The real purpose of the conference was not apparent on the surface. It was not primarily to establish a cartel for the purpose of acquiring and disposing of the products of the Americas; nor to establish a \"collective trusteeship\" over the foreign-controlled islands of the western hemisphere. These were probably incidental objectives but they were not the moving cause of the Jews who brought about this conference. The true pu rpose of it was to weld the Americas and Canada together into a compact fighting unit and to preserve the gold standard. It was a Jew scheme concocte d by the Jew Adolph Berle, Assistant Secretary of State, in furtherance of their purpose to dest roy our government."},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"218 The reason is war. The conference was held in anticipation of the British mov- ing their government to Canada, for there can be no long war otherwise.

PARTY GOVERNMENT \"By the ceaseless praise of Democr atic Rule we shall divide the Christians into political parties, we shall destroy the unity of their nations, we shall sow discord everywhere. Reduced to impotence, they will bow before the Law of Our Bank, always united, and al- ways devoted to our Cause.\"—From Funeral Oration of Rabbi Reichhorn. (Addendum to Protocols.) It is shocking to learn that the Jews are responsible for the creation of political parties and that they have caused them to be organized for the purpose of promoting discord and confusion, and to subject us to the \"law of our bank.\" The rule of political parties has until recent years been universal throughout the world even in those countries where the head of the nation was a king or an emperor. They have within the past few years been abolished in Germany, Italy, Spain, and Hungary, and more rece ntly in Romania and France, together with the Jewish Continental free masonry and B'nai B'rith. These governments are now called \"totalitarian\" in contra-distinction to those ruled by the Jews and political parties called \"democratic.\" We have all prided ourselves more or le ss on our party loyalty and regularity. We boast that we have never \"scratched the ticket\" and that our fathers before us were democrats or republicans, as th e case may be. We all believe that our party stands for sound economic and poli tical policies and that the opposition party is against them, and we are always ready to defend the party's principles as proclaimed in its platform. Observe the phrase \"law of our bank.\" It indicates that there is one law and one bank. There is in fact but one Jewish law and one Jewish bank and it is \"always united and always devoted to our cause.\" Observe also the possessive, \"our bank.\" It is a direct recognition of the fa ct that this bank (the Rothschild bank) belongs to the Jewish race, and that the objective of this bank is the objective of the Jewish race. At the time of this Funeral Oration in 1869 the Jews generally were desperate- ly poor, without citizenship, and living in squalor in the ghettos of the various cities of Europe. There are now many wealthy Jews but the wealth of many of them has stemmed from the Rothschild root. The Rothschild fortune, magni- fied as it has been during the years since it was founded, with all of its branches and affiliates, is still \"united and devoted to our cause.\" It was de-"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"220 voted to that purpose by its founder, old Amschel, and it has been so employed ever since. The \"law of our bank\" represents the ruthless law that has governed what we call \"high finance\" or \"Wall Street\" since the civil war. It represents the law that controls the Bank of England and ot her Rothschild banks. The record of the money power for the past 100 years demonstrates the truth of the conclu- sion that it is \"always united and always devoted to our cause,\" and that \"cause\" is the subjugation and enslavement of the Gentiles and the elevation and enthronement of the Jews. That is the present objective of Jeroboam Rothschild and his secret 300 Elders of Zion. They have sought to incorporate this international banking power and to give it a legal status by establishing the Bank of International Settlements but to date the undertaking has not proven to be very successful. Under the pretense of providing a clearing house for the settlement of German reparations an international conference was held by government appointe d representatives that resulted in the creation of this bank with a capital of $100,000,000. President Hoover appointed Thos. W. Lamont and Owen D. Young as our rep- resentatives to this conference. J. P. Morgan & Co. subscribed $25,000,000 of the capital, the balance of the stock being subscribed by the Bank of England and other central banks. It is strictly a Rothschild super-bank for the purpose of regulating the economy and welfare of the people of the world. The \"law of our bank\" is also the law of the Jewish rabbi and the Jewish lead- ers. The Rothschilds and their Council of the Jewish Agency (the 300 Learned Elders of Zion) are the despotic rulers of the Jewish race. The despot of Zion is already established so far as the Jews are concerned. Some of them are not active Zionists but they are all obedie nt, and most of them are sympathetic. This address of Rabbi Reichhorn was a carefully prepared statement of the plans and purposes of the Jewish race, made by a distinguished Jewish leader on a solemn occasion, in honor of a depa rted leader. It sets them forth with clarity and precision. It is copied in full in Appendix II at the end of this book. We have been divided into two political parties here in America, viz: the dem- ocratic and republican, and the Rothschild banking interest through Baruch, Lamont, et al., and the lavish use of money has acquired control of both of them. There is never any division between the parties where the vital interest of this malign power is concerned."},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"221 A striking example of the truth of this statement is afforded by the enactment of the Federal Reserve Act. It was first attempted through the Republican Par- ty and having failed because of democratic opposition, the Republican Party was defeated and it was then put over in disguise and by deception through the Democratic Party. We have just had two party conventions and the two parties have announced their platforms. There is a shade of difference between them but not enough to enthuse over. In their essentials they are the same. They both pretend isola- tionism but they both nominate interventionist candidates. They both stand for a continuation of the New Deal, for Secretary Hull's reciprocal trade agreements, and for the regimentation of the people of America. The nominees of both parties are satisfactory to the Rothschild interest. The British and the Jews and the Jew press hail Willkie's nomination as a great victory for the warmongers,—and so it was. They could afford to spend $100,000,000 to bring about his nomination, and they may have done so. Who knows? We do know that from the date of his announcement he was giv- en great and favorable publicity by the Jew press, the Jew radio, and the Jew cinema. Whenever his name was mentioned in the convention hall the packed Jew galleries responded with great applause. With a good radio one could dis- tinguish the Yiddish accent and the Soviet yell. The republicans could have won the el ection \"hands down\" with Dewey or Vandenberg or any other respectable no n-interventionist, but republican vic- tory meant nothing to Baruch, Lamont, Lippman and the other Jew politi- cians. They want war. It is true the re publican platform declares against war, but platforms mean nothing to a Jew warmonger or a Jew sponsored candi- date. He will do exactly as the Jews want him to do,—as Roosevelt has done. If he values his life he will not dare double-cross the Rothschild power. The sponsors of the Willkie campaign were Barney Baruch representing the Kuhn, Loeb interest and Thomas W. La mont representing Morgan & Co. They were powerfully aided by the Jew press, radio, etc., and such columnists as Walter Lippman, Dorothy Thompson and other warmongers. Some of these sponsors were likewise sponsors for Roosevelt's third term. They no doubt prefer Roosevelt but fear their ability to elect him and they have therefore se- lected an opposition candidate who has pledged himself to carry out his and their program. \"The Day,\" calling itself \"The National Jewish Daily,\" printed in Yiddish at 183 East Broadway, New York City, Rabbi Samuel Margoshes, Editor, born in Galicia, published in English on July 7,"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"222   1940, the following amazing interv iew with Republican Presiden- tial Nominee Wendell L. Willkie, in the Editor's column: \"I regard anti-Semitism in America as a criminal movement and every anti-Semite as a traitor to America. I spoke over the radio making clear my attitude toward the Jews, long before I even thought of becoming a candidate for the Presidency. I am glad to have an opportunity of expressing my sentiments again . . . What we require are laws by means of which we shall be enabled to eliminate those who would transplant on American soil the poi- sonous growth from Germany and other countries.\" 52 Mr. Willkie's secret commitment to the Jews sheds a flood of light upon the Jewish enthusiasm for him as shown in their press and the thousands of tele- grams sent to the republican national convention delegates and the boisterous gallery applause. If the law that Mr. Willkie advocates is enacted then the author of this book is a traitor and is made a criminal, altho ugh every word contained in it is the truth. It is not the conclusions here stated that create anti-Semitism but it is the conduct and purposes of the Jewish leaders that create it. The Jews have enough power without such a law. They have the power to persecute and to injure any man who dares criticize them and they exercise it ruthlessly,—and yet the truth must be told if conditions here pointed out are ever to be cor- rected by peaceful methods. So far as the Rothschild interest in concerned, it appears to be safe with either Roosevelt or Willkie. They no doubt prefer Roosevelt because he has proven to be their faithful and dependable servant but they will support Willkie if they think he stands the best chance of election. As to the balance of us, it is the difference between tweedledum and tweedledee. Senator McNary, republican nominee for Vice President, is decidedly prefera- ble to Wallace. He appears to be an honest, straight-forward, courageous and capable man. He is at least a genuine friend of the farmer, as shown by the McNary-Haugen bill. This proposed bill would guarantee the farmer the Amer- ican market and profitable prices for hi s products, and it would relieve him of the petty and endless regimentation to which he is now subjected. 52 R.

Mr. Roosevelt and everyone else knew long before the convention was held that he would be the nominee, and yet he chose to remain silent about his acceptance until after he was nominated. He then dramatically accepted it as a call to service, stating that he had \"no desi re or purpose\" to hold the office for a third term. He is in error. It has been his \"desire and purpose\" from the begin- ning, otherwise the convention would not have been stacked. It is simply Mr. Roosevelt's way of doing things, to-wit: to say one thing and mean another. We must abolish political parties. This is not such a radical suggestion as it appears to be, but only a common sense one. There is no reason why any man should not be permitted to run for any office on his own platform, just as he does for a party nomination. There is no reason—absolutely none—for two elections, one for a party nomination and the other to be elected. The father of our country, George Washington, gave us good advice upon this subject, as well as upon the subject of foreign entanglements. He strongly con- demned party government. If we had only listened to his words of wisdom instead of the sly suggestions of the Je ws we would not be in our present dep- lorable situation. We must destroy the shackles that curb our freedom and that we have forged upon ourselves. Congress should elect the President. This was the French system and is an improvement over our effete electoral college. It may require a constitutional amendment. This system will minimize many of the evils of a presidential elec- tion. For one thing it will not permit the \"Elders\" to select for us a candidate satis- factory for their schemes,—a man with \"a dark stain, a 'Panama' in his past.\" For another, it will avoid the tremendous expense of a presidential campaign and thereby void the bribery involved in huge campaign contributions. For still another it will minimize the constant and ever increasing encroachment of the Executive upon the powers of Congress, for the President will be accountable to Congress. And for still another, it will tend to neutralize the power of the foreign vote of the large cities in the election of the President, since it will give all of the small states the advantage of two senatorial votes. This will, as stated, involve a constitutional amendment, but the constitution itself makes provision for its amendment. The process is a laborious and diffi- cult one, but even so it is far better than the plan of the New Deal, viz: to change the constitution through the interpretations of a handpicked court."},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"224 Political parties were designed by the Jews to enable them to corrupt and con- trol governments, and they have been useful instruments in their hands.

It may be that none of these men could be bought directly and individually by Rothschild gold, but the party can be bought, and they can and are delivered by such purchase. The results are the same. Their country is \"sold down the river\" just as effec- tively and as completely as if each an d every one of them had been personally corrupted. This is not peculiar to the Democratic Party. The Republican Party is for sale and is sold like a sack of potatoes, and the leaders of the party are delivered like a sack of potatoes. We ha ve become so inured and blind to party government that many of our politicians openly proclaim their fealty to party over their convictions and their loyalty to their country. This is not peculiar to America and to our system of government. The same has until recently been true of every country of the world. It is through the corruption of political parties that the Jews have ruled the world; it is their brand of their boasted \"democracy.\" It was evidently true in England when the Peel amendment was adopted. It was tr ue when the McDonald (labor party) government was in power; there was no substantial difference between it and the preceding and succeeding conservative governments. It is true now in Eng- land. The government of the British Empire is today as strongly Jewish as our own; and this control was obtained in the same corrupt manner that they obtained their power here, viz: by the corruption of political parties. The Jews and their propaganda agencies are riding the English and American people hard at this time but they are riding for a fall.

Isolationism does not present any such picture to \"the overwhelming majority of Americans.\" We have been isolation- ists all of our lives; it is the traditional policy our government, and we have never before feared the loss of our freedom and \"an unpitying master.\" A dicta- torship does offer such a prospect but we have no fear of a foreign dictator.

The Jewish members became exiles and the French government, after sufferi ng losses of 1,900,000 men in dead, wounded and prisoners, surrendered. And now the British government through a renegade (DeGaulle) has organized an opposition government and is nightly bombing French cities. Our govern ment has also turned on her former ally (?) and has seized her gold stored in the Kentucky vaults and her ships that are in our ports. We can now very well believe that the Germans are right in claiming that Churchill sank the \"Athenia\" for propaganda purposes.

It will consider in the broad sense, the defense of the north half of the Western Hemis- phere.\" This agreement is in very broad terms and is subject to almost any interpreta- tion one chooses to place upon it. The mildest interpretation that can be placed upon it is that it constitutes a military alliance between the United States and the Dominion of Canada at a time when Canada is engaged in war with the totalitarian powers. There has been some speculation in the press as to whether or not the agree- ment involves the transfer to Canada of fifty of our American destroyers to be used by Britain in her war with Germany and Italy. This transfer was previous- ly recommended by \"Sir\" John J. Pershing, and within a few days thereafter (less than a week) we had a Gallup poll upon it showing 62% of the American people favoring the transfer."},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"234 It has been stated in the press that the President has advised with Attorney General Jackson and other subordinates who have informed him that it is not necessary to refer this coalition to Congress for confirmation. Up to this hour the President has not done so. It is extremely doubtful if he will. He is not like- ly to do so unless he receives previous assurance that it will be confirmed. This agreement, like all other Jew schemes that have been perpetrated upon the American people, is not what it purports to be. It has been represented as affording us air bases in Canada and other British possessions for the defense of the United States, and that it is but an extension of the Monroe Doctrine and does not commit the United States to war except for defense of the west- ern hemisphere. But that is not the interpretation that has been placed upon it by the British Government. Mr. Churchil l and his associates understand its true meaning, and they were so rejoiced over it that they could not refrain from giving us a slight glimpse of it. It has a meaning that the President and the Jew press would not dare expose to Congress and to the American people. The following is a quotation from the Associated Press report from London of August 20, 1940: \"Utterly confident, Prime Minister Churchill used his disclosure of the plan for air-naval base leases to declare that the British Em- pire and the United States 'will have to be mixed together in some of their affairs for mutual and general advantage.' \"'No one can stop it!' he cried.’Li ke the Mississippi, it just keeps rolling along, let it roll! Let it roll on full flood, irresistible, to broader lands and better days' \" \"Tumult from the House of Comm ons steep and crowded benches almost smothered the Prime Minister's last words.\" Does anyone imagine for a moment that the mere leasing of air-bases, or a military pact for the protection of the United States would have occasioned the burst of eloquence of Prime Minister Churchill and the tumult and enthusiasm of the House of Commons? The former Jew war minister, Mr. Hore-Belisha, let the cat out of the bag in his statement regarding the matter, which the Associated Press of the same date quotes as follows:"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"235 was at that time \"British Intellige \"In the House of Commons tonight Leslie Hore-Belisha, the former War Secretary, raised the possibility of 'an eventual common citi- zenship' of Britain and the United States, and said this alone would almost compensate for 'the evils of war.' Such a union, Hore-Belisha recalled, was offered, in vain, to France in the hour of the third Republic's collapse.\" Observe that he says that they offered th e same thing \"to France in the hour of the third Republic's collapse.\" That offe r was to absorb France into the British Empire. Observe also that Hore-Belisha states that this innocent appearing pact \"would almost compensate (Britain) for the evils of war.\" These shrewd Jews always know the \"low down,\" and they are so conceited that they cannot refrain from bragging. Thus, according to the views of Messrs. Churchill and Hore-Belisha, the true meaning of this agreement is that we have sacrificed our independence as a nation and have been merged into the British Empire as one of its dominions. And thus, without consulting Congress or the American people, we have be- come not only a part of the British Empire, but we have entered the war against the totalitarian powers. This program is not a new scheme just invented by President Roosevelt and his \"kitchen cabinet.\" It is the adopted plan of the Elders and the managers of the Rothschild Trust to establish their world empire. They control, and have for many years controlled the British Empi re. It has been ruled ostensibly by a king and his cabinet, but in fact by the Jews. This plan is set out in detail in the Col. E. M. House letter. 55 The real author of this letter is unknown, and because of that fact the letter itself was discredited. Evidently the author was not Col. House, nor was it Dr. Wm. J. Maloney. 56 The letter shows upon its face that it was written by a Jew and by a person holding a high official position with the British Government at the time (June 10, 1919). It was written upon the stationery of the British consulate of New York City and addressed to the Hon. David Lloyd-George, then Prime Minister of England.

While ther e is doubt as to the identity of the actual author, there can be none as to the authenticity of the letter. The Jew can always be depended upon to hide his identity and to destroy the proof of it, if it is possible to do so. Because of the length of the letter it is not reproduced in its entirety. I trust that the following excerpts will be sufficient to show its verity and its charac- ter. The letter reveals the powerful forces that are now at work to overthrow this government and to bring it back into the British Empire as a dominion, and it reveals the traitors who are cooperating with the British the the Jews to that end. I quote the following paragraphs from it: \"'Our thanks are due to Messrs. Taft and Polk, who elaborated with us our German-Irish plot programme. To Mr. Baker and the innumerable library committees who banned from the camps the anti-British books on our index expurgatorious. To Mr. Gregory, who lent punitive force to our wi shes regarding spoken and writ- ten speeches. And Messrs. Pierpont Morgan, Rockefeller, Cleve- land Dodge, Wanamaker, Hamlin, Childs, DuPont, Ryan, Insull, Doheny, and others of our friends who financed our 'Americanization' campaign. I woul d especially call attention to the beneficence of Messrs. Insull, and Doheny, who were the ge- nerous supporters of the divers ion, devised by Messrs. Taft and O'Connor, entitled, 'Ireland Sta bbed England in the Back.' These contributors doubtless will be, or have been, appropriately re- warded by His Majesty's Government.\" The Mr. Baker referred to in this para graph was then our Secretary of War, and the Mr. Gregory was our Attorney General. I do not know whether any of these gentlemen \"have been appropriately rewarded by His Majesty's Govern- ment.\" \"Through the Red Cross, the Scout movement, the Y. M. C.

The distinction between the form of true internationalism and fa lse internationalism is imperceptible, but all of it is bad, and none of it fits in with our scheme of government. \"To all ages and classes, to every phase of human activity, by all channels of human communications, our propaganda permeates. Our command over the cables and press, the schools and the uni- versities, the pulpit and the trib unes, will tend to increase. Soon we should be in a position to control at will the reading, the hear- ing, and the seeing of the inhabitants so that such ideas as are not truly British may be met with a barrier, 'They shall not pass.' \" That states a truth that has already be en commented upon. It states a truth which should be apparent to all of us, every day of our lives; we get nothing from either the press or the radio or the cinema that does not favor the British. They let \"nothing pass\" that tends to present any other point of view. \"May I also call your attention to the services of Prof. Richard Gotthell, of Columbia University (the one who pinned the medal on F. D. Roosevelt in 1937 for hi s distinguished service to world Jewry), in our campaign agains t the Hindus, and of Miss Elisa- beth Marbury and Messrs. Charles McCarthy and Karl Watters in that against the Irish . . . \"The cost of converting an Americ an into a colonist of His Majesty is now 63 cents. Our expenses we have met by a levy on the popu- lation.\" The statement made in parenthesis about the Roosevelt medal evidently is comment and not a part of the so-called House letter. While we appear to be cheap, particularly in the eyes of the Jews, I do not be- lieve that the American people can be bought at the rate of 53 cents a head. If that were true we would have been a part of the British Empire long ago. It is a part of the Jew character to over-estim ate himself and his money, and to un- der-estimate the \"goi.\""},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"238 \"In the financial world the Anglo-American alliance is a well- established fact. And as the consortium for China, and the security company for Mexico show, our brokers and their aids have be- come the unchallenged financiers of the world. We have been par- ticularly fortunate in our fiscal agents here, Messrs. Pierpont Morgan & Co. . . . \"Their services in putting this country into the war may not have been altruistic, but they were no netheless effective. They contri- buted liberally to our Americanization campaign. They ousted Miss Boardman, and through Messrs. Taft and H. P.

Through Mr. Thomas Lamont they purchased Harpers Magazine and the New York Evening Post. Through advertisers they con- trol, they have exerted widespread influence on newspaper policy. \"Messrs.

Their attempts to retain for us control of the in- ternational mercantile marine are well known to you.\" The Anglo-American finance alliance has been heretofore pointed out. It is the ownership of our principal financial institutions through the Rothschild mon- ey trust. We know about the services of Morgan & Co., in getting us into the war; about Mr. Davidson's direction of the Red Cross, and about Mr. Lamont's valuable aid at the peace conference; but we did not know that \"they loaned $200,000,000 that Britain's ally (Japan) might build a fleet to compete with America on the Pacific carrying routes.\" That is rank treason to our country on the part of the firm of Morgan & Co. It is rank treason to America on the part of its ally, the British Government. And it is this same British Government that is now pleading with us to rescue them from their own machinations and infamy. Please note the statement that \"our brokers and their aids have become the unchallenged financiers of the world.\" These \"brokers\" are N. M. Rothschild & Sons and they have been the \"unchallenged\" financiers of the world for more than a hundred years. The firm of Morgan & Co. is not an \"aid\" but a branch.

And through the nationali- zation by His Majesty's Government of the Cowdray, Person, and Royal Dutch Shell interests in Me xico, we, having become masters of the Mexican, Canadian, Romanian, Armenian, Persian, and lesser oil fields, now largely control the oil fuel of the world and thereby the world's transportation and industry. We have not yet succeeded in controlling the pipe lines owned by the Standard Oil Co. and its subsidiaries, for those companies have long been es- tablished.\" This is also a revealing statement. We knew in a general way that \"His Majes- ty's Government had acquired large oil interests in Mexico and other coun- tries,\" but we did not know that the $4,000,000,000.00 we loaned Britain was used to acquire these oil interests and to obtain a monopoly of the oil re- sources of the world. \"This control (of world's oil supply ) would enable us to exert such pressure as would make Americ an industrial interests amenable to His Majesty's pleasure. But it would be unwise to make discip- linary use of our fuel power befo re we secure remission of our $4,000,000,000.00 debt. Otherwise, the American industrial in- terests might retaliate by forcing th e United States Government to exact from us the agreed interest, to maintain tariff barriers against our merchandise, and to withdraw support from the rate of exchange, which would make our labor and resources for years pay tribute to this country (United States), an unnatural, unfilial, and unthinkable proceeding. \"We are conducting a vigorous campaign for the cancellation of this war debt, on the grounds (a) that we fought America's fight for her for 2 years, while she wa s prospering in cowardice; and (b) that at least the material burdens should be distributed justly, if the world is to be made safe for democracy.

In these agitations we are receiving valuable, if not whol-"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"240 ly disinterested, aid from our financial auxiliaries and fiscal agents.\" If this is not treachery of the basest sort, what do you call it? They've got our money, used it to buy up the oil properties of the world, and are seeking to escape payment of it. When they have accomplished that, they propose to make \"disciplinary use of our fuel power in order to make American industrial interests amenable to His Majesty's pleasu re.\" They add insult to injury by the statement that \"We fought America's fight for her for 2 years while she was pros- pering in cowardice.\" And the grounds here stated are the gr ounds upon which they are seeking to cancel their debt to us,—leaving out of course the word \"cowardice.\" However, we are quietly continuing our work in Mexico until the United States Government shall be put in a position to take it over. An American war with Mexico would cost us no thing; it would sa- tisfy certain American industrial interests; it would guarantee our title to the Mexican oil fields ; it would humble, by impoverish- ing, this purse-proud people; it would give us an opportunity to show the American that he —isolated in the world—needs our pro- tection against our a lly, Japan; and while America was busy warring we would enjoy a clear fi eld in the European, African, and Asiatic trade, together with the monopoly of the markets of a South America hostile to the Monroe Doctrinaries of democracy. For these reasons our press is fully reporting Mexican outrages, but a strange apathy seems to have fallen on the people, an apa- thy from which only border raids or special atrocities will arouse them.\" Thus it appears that Britain has been seeking to promote war between us and Mexico because it would \"cos t us nothing .. . it would guarantee our title to the Mexican oil fields . . . it would humble, by impoverishing, this purse-proud (American) people; it would give us an opportunity to show the American that he—isolated in the world—needs our protection against our ally, Japan.\" \"Below that level, imperial unit y cannot be securely established upon the debris of the Constitution here (in America).

Has not President Wilson cancel ed the big Navy program and du- tifully conceded to us the command of the seas, confident that we shall defend America against all fu ture foes that may threaten our supremacy, just as we defended America and Canada, against Germany?\" Alas, all of these achievements have been accomplished. They have been sug- ar-coated in such way that our people did not know they were serving the pur- poses of the British, but thought that they were doing the right thing. \"But I regret to inform you that our Committee on American Elec- tions has reported (Appendix 38) that no matter how lavishly we finance the next election, the Wilson administration will pass, and with it, perchance, that absolute administrative control over the Legislature, which has meant so much to us. Willful, wanton, and wicked men will unite in the next election with labor and those in- dustrialists whose profit-patriotism ratio has been allowed to fall below the threshold of loyalty to imperial unity. These combined forces of disorder will seek to elect a Legislature which will at- tempt to make the administration re sponsible to it, instead of to us and our auxiliaries, and will striv e to rend the bonds which bind this colony to the mother-land, for the sole, selfish, and seditious purpose of erecting a separate, national, economic unit indepen- dent of us—and even, perhaps, competing with us. We must, therefore, hasten to remove from this Legislature, with the aid of our supporters here, such of its powers as could be used against imperial unity. \"In other words, we must quickly act to transfer its dangerous sovereignty from this colony to the custody of the Crown. We must, in short, now bring America within the Empire. God helping us, we can do no other.

We have wrapped this plan in the peace treaty so that the world must accept from us the League or a continuance of the"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"242 war. The League is in substance the Empire with America admit- ted on the same basis as our other colonies.\" And so the British Government has a \"C ommittee on American Elections\" and they finance these elections even \"lavishly\" where there is a chance to win; otherwise they refuse to put up the money. They can afford to spend money \"lavishly\" for they are playing for high stakes, viz: to cancel a $4,000,000,000.00 debt and to save th e tottering Jewish-British Empire. This financing is obviously done through \"our broker\" (N. M. Rothschild & Sons). We do not know with certainty who compose the \"Committee on Amer- ican Elections,\" but I think I can name th ree of its members, viz: \"Sir\" Thomas W. Lamont, Sir William Wisemann, and Sir (?) B. M. Baruch. Unfortunately for the schemes of these conspirators, the Democratic Party was thrown out of power, and unfortunat ely for them also, Congress refused to ratify the League of Nations. Their intimate knowledge of President Wilson and his weaknesses, and of the best method of approach, is uncanny: \"Our best policy, therefore, would be to appoint President Wilson first president of the League . . . \"He is easily slighted and remarkably vindictive.

In the same way he will now be able to satisfy them that far from surrendering their independence to the League they are actually extending their sovereignty by it.\" They made the naive suggestion: \"I would suggest that as soon as the President is settled once more in the White House, the visit should be returned by His Royal Highness, the Prince of Wales, who would be an admirable repre- sentative of His Royal Sire, and would satisfy President Wilson's sense of fitness.

But far more me- nacing than that fact is the fact that it is also the secret purpose of the manag- ers of the Rothschild money trust. The prime objective on the part of the conspirators, who brought about the present war, was to establish the League of Nations. The prime object of Presi- dent Roosevelt was to be president of this League. If it had been established he would undoubtedly have gotten the job.

The text quoted above could very well ha ve been taken from the protocols or the Talmud, for it contains the philosophy of both, viz: the enslavement of the people. It is, however, a quotation from an article by Lillian Scott Troy, pub- lished in The San Francisco Leader in February 1912, and re-published by Congressman J. Thorkelson in the Congressional Record. The author states that it is in substance a quotation from a \"book written by Lieutenant Colonel Lowther, military secretary and official mouthpiece of the Duke of Connaught.\" It is a frank explanation of the sordid poverty that now prevails in England and that has existed since the enactment of the Peel amendment and the repeal of the Corn laws (tariff) in 1844. This was the date the Rothschilds obtained control of the economic welfare of the people of Eng- land through the Peel amendment. The reader should note the fact that \"sharp class distinction or illiterate rab- ble\" have been produced in England designedly. They are in fact the direct result of banker controlled prices and wages, free labor and free trade. The fact should also be noted that this poverty is regarded as \"very desirable\" by the Jewish plutocrats in Englan d for the reason that \"the more ignorant the lower classes, the more easily they are controlled.\" We have the same powerful forces at work in this country, viz: banker control of our economy and free labor and free trade, called internationalism.

Our plutocrats are seeking to restore our country to the British Empire in order that they may become lords, barons, counts, and sirs, and that the mass of the people may be the \"illiterate rabble\" and consequently \"the more easily controlled.\" Unfortunately, the election of Mr. Willkie promises no relief. The Jew press applauded his statement to the effect that he could not promise much hope, that we must all make sacrifices, and that we must recover the ground we have lost \"the hard way.\" It can't be done. His acceptance speech was a ratification of the New Deal, including deflation, its reciprocal trade treaties, its conscrip- tion of an army in peacetime, and its gift of fifty of our destroyers to the Brit- ish. He appears to be only a dummy candid ate in order to insure the election of Roosevelt. Messrs. Willkie and Roosevelt, however, do not themselves propose to travel \"the hard way.\" The greatest achievement of Wendell Willkie is that he sold his power plants to the Jew Deal Administra tion at an exorbitant price, to-wit: $76,000,000, and that he resi gned an annual salary of $75,000 to become a presidential candidate. The Roosevelt Administration has been di stinguished by the fact that it has been an exceedingly profitable one to the Roosevelt family. The Chicago Tri- bune estimates that the President and his family have made $2,750,000 dur- ing his seven years in office. (It would be interesting to know how much of that has been paid out in income taxes.) Both President Roosevelt and Wendell Willkie are second rate New York law- yers. They both appear, however, to have been first-rate promoters. They are both presidential candidates hand-picked for us by the Rothschild interest. It is not of much consequence to the Rothschilds or to the British plutocracy which one is elected, for their interests will be safe with either. The chances are that they prefer Roosevelt becaus e he is the smarter of the two. The leading feature of Willkie's acceptance speech was his challenge to Roose- velt to debate. What issue? Not the tariff issue; they stand together on that. Not the destruction of the Rothschild control of our economy (which is the most important issue) ; they stand together on that. Not \"taxing, lending, and spending\"; they stand together on that. Not internationalism; they stand to-"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"249 gether on that. Not conscription; they stand together on that. Not the gift of our destroyers to Great Britain; they stand together on that. Not the issue of intervention in the present war; they stand together on that. Apparently the only issue between them is which one can best administer the New Deal, which, interpreted, means wh ich one can best serve the Rothschild interest, Roosevelt has made a pretty good job of it and there appears to be no valid reason for the Rothschilds to want a change. Indeed, it is doubtful if there will be, because if Mr. Roosevelt finds that he will likely be defeated he will declare the election off, and will be supported by his Attorney General, our democratic representatives in congress, and Willkie will accept the situation with good grace. Mr. Willkie is reported to have said that he did not desire the support of Father Coughlin or of any other anti-Semitic. Th is Willkie is not worthy to touch the hem of Father Coughlin's garment. Father Coughlin is everything that Willkie is not, and Willkie is everything that Father Coughlin is not. The difference between them is the difference between daylight and darkness, between a bold patriot and a time-serving politician, between a man who seeks to elevate the masses and one who is willing to serve the selfish interests of the classes. I appeal to the members of Congress: Many of the facts stated in these pages are probably unknown to you, but as far as you know them you must know that they are true. The facts you do not know are also true. You may wish to ignore the \"House letter,\" but it contains too much truth to permit you to do so. You should resolve any doubt you may have regarding it, in favor of your country. You have been misled by the Jew press and by lies and subterfuges, but it is not too late to correct your errors. The people have elected you to represent them and they look to you for guid- ance. If you fail them, if you permit th e destruction of our government, you are traitors to your duty and to your country. You will be hated by your constitu- ents and despised by the men who have used you. I appeal to the red-blooded Americans among you, of both parties, to get together and organize a party that stands for America and the Americ an people, and against war and inter- nationalism; and to nominate true American candidates for president, sena- tors, and congressmen. Such a ticket will sweep the country. I appeal to the American people to support your ticket. In the last analysis it all gets back to us, the people. Do we intend to surrender our liberty without a protest and without a fight? It is within our power to redeem our government by the ballot, and without bloodshed and revolution.

Therein we gain a double advantage. In the first place we keep in check all countries, for they well know that we have the power whenever we like to create disorders or to restore order. All these countries are accustomed to see in us an indispensable force of coercion. In the second place, by our intrigues we shall tangle up all the threads which we have stretched into the cabinets of all States by means of the political, by economic treaties, or loan obligations. In order to succeed in this we must use great cunning and penetration during negotiations and agreements, but, as regards what is called the \"official language,\" we shall keep to the opposite tactics and assume the ma sk of honesty and compliancy. In this way the peoples and governments of the goyim, whom we have taught to look only at the outside whatever we present to their notice, will still continue to accept us as the benefactors and saviors of the human race. \"We must be in a position to respond to every act of opposition by war with the neighbors of that country which dares to oppose us; but if these neighbors should also venture to stand collectively together against us, then we must suffer resistance by a universal war. \"The principal factor of success in the political is the secrecy of its undertak- ings; the word should not agree with the deeds of the diplomat. \"We must compel the governments of the goyim to take action in the direction favored by our widely-conceived plan , already approaching the desired con- summation, by what we shall represent as public opinion, secretly prompted by us through the means of that so-called \"Great Power\"—the Press, which, with a few exceptions that may be disr egarded, is already entirely in our hands. \"In a word, to sum up our system of keeping the governments of the goyim in Europe in check, we shall show our stre ngth to one of them by terrorist at-"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"252 tempts and to all, if we allow the possibility of a general rising against us, we shall respond with the guns of America or China or Japan."},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"APPENDIX II. \"Funeral Oration\" The Fatal Discourse of Rabbi Reichhorn [\"(In its issue of 21 October, 1920 (No. 195) La Vieille France published an extremely important Russian document in which the following passage occurs: \" 'There is a striking analogy between th e Protocols of the Elders of Zion and the discourse of the Rabbi Reichhorn, pron ounced in Prague in 1869 over the tomb of the Grand Rabbi Simeon-ben-Ihuda, and published by Readcliffe, who paid with his life for the divulgation. Sonol, who had taken Readcliffe to hear Reichhorn, was killed in a duel some ti me afterwards. The general ideas for- mulated by the Rabbi are found fully developed in the Protocols,' (which were published about 35 years later). \"In its issue of 10 March, 1921, (No. 214) La Vieille France gives the version of this funeral oration which was published in La Russie Juive. It is perfectly clear that the funeral oration and the Protocols of the Elders of Zion come from one and the same mint. Both are prophetic; and the power which made the prophecies has been able to bring about their fulfillment. There can no longer be any doubt as to whose is the power which is disturbing the world, creating World Unrest, and at the same ti me reaping all of the profits. Jewry is enslaving all Christian peoples of the earth. There IS a Jew World Plot and it now stands finally and completely unmasked).] \"1. Every hundred years, We, the Sages of Israel, have been accustomed to meet in Sanhedrin in order to examin e our progress towards the domination of the world which Jehovah has promised us, and our conquests over the ene- my, Christianity. \"2. This year, united over the tomb of our reverend Simeonben-Ihuda, we can state with pride that the past century has brought us very near to our goal, and that this goal will be very soon attained. \"3. Gold always has been and always will be the irresistible power. Handled by expert hands it will always be the most useful lever for those who possess it, and the object of envy for those who do not.

Already the principal banks, the exchanges of the entire world, the credits of all governments, are in our hands. \"5. The other great power is THE PRESS. By repeating without cessation cer- tain ideas, the Press succeeds in the end in having them accepted as actuali- ties. The Theatre renders us analogous services. Everywhere the Press and the Theatre obey our orders. \"6. By the ceaseless praise of DEMOCRATIC RULE we shall divide the Chris- tians into political parties, we shall destroy the unity of their nations, we shall sow discord everywhere. Reduced to impotence, they will bow before the LAW of OUR BANK, always united, and always devoted to our Cause. \"7. We shall force the Christians into wars by exploiting their pride and their stupidity. They will massacre each other, and clear the ground for us to put our people into. \"8. The possession of the land has always brought influence and power. In the name of social Justice and Equality we shall parcel out the great estates; we shall give the fragments to the peasants who covet them with all their powers, and who will soon be in debt to us by the expense of cultivating them. Our capital will make us their masters. We in our turn shall become the great proprietors, and the possession of the land will assure the power to us. \"9. Let us try to replace the circulation of gold with paper money; our chests will absorb the gold, and we shall regulate the value of the paper which will make us masters of all the positions. \"10.

We shall promise workmen salaries of which they have never dared to dream, but we shall also raise the price of necessities so that our profits will be greater still. \"11.

We must endeavor to provide the Goyim with lawyers and doctors; the lawyers are au courant with all interests; doctors, once in the house, become confessors and directors of consciences. \"14.

If one of our people should unhappily fall into the hands of justice amongst the Christians, we must rush to help him; find as many witnesses as he needs to save him from his judges, until we become judges ourselves. \"16.

We shall furnish them with all the money their folly demands, and so shall keep them in leash. \"17. Let us take care not to hinder the marriage of our men with Christian girls, for through them we shall get our foot into the most closely locked circles. If our daughters marry Goyim they will be no less useful, for the children of a Jewish mother are ours. Let us foster the idea of free love, that we may destroy among Christian women attachment to th e principles and practices of their religion. \"18. For ages past the sons of Israel, despised and persecuted, have been work- ing to open up a path to power. They are hitting the mark. They control the economic life of the accursed Christians; their influence preponderates over politics and over manners. \"19.
