The United States of America republic does not presently have lawful money in circulation . 7 2. America has not had lawful money since 1933. 8 3. There is no legal definition for what the word “dollar” means as printed on a Federal Reserve Note . 9 4. We have three types of currency in place at this time : 10 4.1. Lawful mo ney minted under the authority of the United States of America Money Act, 1 Stat. 246 -251 . This 11 money is no longer printed or mint ed. 12 4.2. Gold and silver coins issued by the U.S. Mint that are minted pursuant to 31 U.S.C. §5112 . The se coins are not 13 lawful money because they are not in compliance with the United States of America Money Act, 1 Stat. 246 -251, 14 which has never been repealed . 15 4.3. Private scrip issued by the mint and borrowed from Federal Reserve that has never been approved for “private 16 use” and may only be used inte rnally within the U.S. government under the authority of the Federal Reserve Act. 17 5. The fact that America d oes not have lawful money is the direct result of the following factors: 18 5.1. The United States Government, via the U.S. Mint , refuses to fulfill its consti tutional duty to mint money issued 19 under the authority of and in compliance with the United States of America Money Act, 1 Stat. 246- 251 . This act 20 has never been repealed and therefore MUST be obeyed by the U.S. Congress . 21 5.2. A state of national emergency is in existence and has been in existence since March 9, 1933, when the Emergency 22 Banking Relief Act, 48 Stat. 1, was enacted. The President refuses his constitutional duty to remove this national 23 emergency and return to a lawful money system. 24 5.3. Presidential Proclamation 4074 prevents Federal Reserve Notes from being redeemed in lawful currency (silver 25 coin) as required by 12 U.S.C. § 411. This proclamation was issued under the authority of 12 U.S.C. §95b , which 26 unconstitutionally delegates lawmaking powers to the President. 27 6. Which of the three monetary systems you wish to use is entirely up to you. 28 2 Authorities on “deceit in commerce” and “just weights and measures” 29 This section describes authorities for ju st weights, measures, and trade from various authoritative sources. The Bible says 30 that the love of money, not money itself, is the root of ALL evil. 31 \"The love of [your] money is the root of all [government] evil.\" 32 [ 1 Tim. 6:10 , Bible, NKJV] 33 The Bible also c oncludes that dishonest commerce was the reason that Satan himself was cast out of God’s presence. Satan 34 is therefore the root of all evil because he loved money: 35 “ By the abundance of your [Satan’s] trading [commerce] 36 You became filled with violence within, 37 And you sinned; 38 Therefore I cast you as a profane thing 39 Out of the mountain of God; 40 And I destroyed you, O covering cherub, 41 From the midst of the fiery stones. 42 [Eze. 28:16 , Bible, NKJV] 43 Ayn Rand put it best, when she said in her book Atlas Shrugged about the subject of money, and the requirement for 44 consent , honesty, and integrity by government in any and every endeavor: 45 \"Money is the barometer of a society's virtue . When you see that trading [or religiou s ministry, for that matter] 46 is done, not by consent, but by [government] compulsion [or regulation] --when you see that in order to 47 produce, you need to obtain permission from men [in the IRS ] who produce nothing --when you see that money 48"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" The Money Scam 13 of 120 Copyright Sovereignty Education and Defense Ministry, http://sedm.org Form 05.041, Rev. 10- 18- 200 9 EXHIBIT:________ is flowing to those who deal, not in goods, but in [political] favors --when you see that men get richer by graft 1 and by pull [\" extortion under the color of law \"] than by work, and your laws don't protect you against them 2 [the government], but protect them [the government] against you --when you see corruption being rewarded [by 3 a corrupted federal judiciary ] and honesty [and hard work, and personal responsibility] becoming a self - 4 sacrifice--you may know that your society is doomed[!]. Money is so noble a medium that it does not compete 5 with guns and it does not make terms with brutality. It will not permit a country to survive as half- property, 6 half -loot. 7 \"Whenever destroyers [the IRS , the Federal Reserve , and the Dept of J ustice ] appear among men, they start by 8 destroying money, for money is men's protection and the base of a moral existence. Destroyers [in the Federal 9 Reserve] seize gold and leave to its owners a counterfeit pile of [fiat] paper. This kills all objective standards 10 and delivers men into the arbitrary power of an arbitrary setter of values [a corrupted government , in this 11 case]. Gold was [and continues to be] an objective value, an equivalent of wealth produced. Paper is a 12 mortgage on wealth that does not exist, backed by a gun aimed [by a tyrant judge with a conflict of interest ] at 13 those who are expected to produce it. Paper [Federal Reserve Notes] is a check drawn by legal looters upon an 14 account which is not theirs: upon the virtue of the victims. Watch for the day when it becomes, marked: 15 'Account overdrawn.' 16 \"When you have made evil [government looting through constructive fraud, obfuscation and complication of the 17 tax laws, and through socialist/humanist tax system that rewards and subsidizes laziness, irresponsibility, and 18 government dependency and punishes and taxes success ] the means of survival, do no t expect men to remain 19 good. Do not expect them to stay moral and lose their lives for the purpose of becoming the fodder of the 20 immoral [government parasites]. Do not expect them to produce, when production is punished and 21 [government] looting rewarded. D o not ask, 'Who is destroying the world?' You are [by doing NOTHING to 22 correct the corruption or by accepting ANY of the stolen loot in the form of a government handout/bribe].\" 23 [Atlas Shrugged , Ayn Rand, p. 387 ] 24 By making the above statement, Ms . Rand is emphasizing that there is no more important area where government honesty 25 and integrity is necessary than in the way government handles money and commerce . A government that mishandles or 26 covets money and steals it is a bad government that is intent on dest roying, not protecting the society that it is 27 constitutionally tasked with protecting . 28 \"The king [or public servant] establishes the land by justice ; but he who receives bribes [o r stolen LOOT] 29 overthrows it.\" 30 [Prov. 29:4 , Bible, NKJV] 31 “Getting trea sures [stolen loot] by a lying tongue 32 Is the fleeting fantasy of those who seek death. 33 The violence of the wicked will destroy them, 34 Because they refuse to do justice.” 35 [ Prov. 21:6- 7 , Bible, NKJV] 36 God says in the Bible that deceit in commerce, and by implication taxation as well, is a h ateful abomination to the Lord . 37 What God hates, we are also supposed to hate as Christians, and notice the thing that is being hated is not a person, but an 38 evil and unlawful behavior that violates God's laws and/or man's laws . Below is an explanation of precisely why God hates 39 deceit in commerce so vehemently and why ultimately, those who openly and willfully practice it are going to HELL, based 40 on commentary relating to the Prov. 11:1 , 10:10 , 20:23 found in the Bible: 41 \"As religion towards God is a branch of universal righteousness (he is not an honest man that is not devout), so 42 righteousness towards men is a branch of true religion, for he is not a godly man that is not honest , nor can 43 he expect that his devotion should be accepted; for, 44 1. Nothing is more offensive to God than deceit in commerce . A false balance is here put for all manner of 45 unjust and f raudulent practices [of our public dis -servants] in dealing with any person [within the public], 46 which are all an abomination to the Lord, and render those abominable [hated] to him that allow themselves 47 in the use of such accursed arts of thriving. It is an affront to justice, which God is the patron of, as well as a 48 wrong to our neighbour, whom God is the protector of. Men [in the IRS and the Congress] make light of 49 such frauds, and think there is no sin in that which there is money to be got by, and, while it passes 50 undiscovered, they cannot blame themselves for it; a blot is no blot till it is hit, Hos. 12:7, 8 . But they are not 51 the less an abomination to God, who will be the avenger of those that are defrauded by their brethren. 52 2. Nothing is more pleasing to God than fair and honest dealing, nor more necessary to make us and our 53 devotions acceptable to him: A just weight is his delight. He himself goes by a just weight, and holds the scale 54 of judgment with an even hand, and therefore is pleased with those that are herein followers of him. 55"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" The Money Scam 14 of 120 Copyright Sovereignty Education and Defense Ministry, http://sedm.org Form 05.041, Rev. 10- 18- 200 9 EXHIBIT:________ A [false] balance, [ whether it be in the federal courtroom or at the IRS or in the marketplace ,] cheats, 1 under pretence of doing right most exactly, and therefore is the greater abomination to God.\" 2 [Matthew Henry’s Commentary on the Whole Bible; Henry, M., 1996, c1991, under Prov. 11:1 ] 3 Daniel Webster, an early statesman of America, also had the following to say about a monetary system that is not based on 4 substance, when he said: 5 It would be to our everlasting reproach, it would be placing us below the general level of the intelligence of 6 civilized states, to admit that we cannot contrive means to enjoy the benefits of bank circulation, and of 7 avoiding, at the same time, its dangers. Indeed, Sir, no contrivance is necessa ry. It is contrivance and the love 8 of contrivance, that spoil all. We are destroying ourselves by a remedy which no evil called for. We are ruining 9 perfect health b y nostrums and quackery . We have lived hitherto under a well constructed, practical, and 10 ben eficial system; a system not surpassed by any in the world; and it seems to me to be presuming largely 11 indeed, on the credulity and self denial of the people, to rush with such sudden and impetuous haste into new 12 schemes and new theories, to overturn and annihilate all that we have so long found useful. 13 Our s ystem has hitherto been one in which paper has been circulating on the strength of a specie basis; that is 14 to say, when every bank- note was convertible into specie at the will of the holder. This has been our guard 15 against excess. While banks are bound to redeem their bills by payi ng gold and silver on demand, and are at all 16 times able to do this, the currency is safe and convenient. Such a currency is not paper money, in its odious 17 sen se. It is not like the Continental paper of Revolutionary times; it is not like the worthless bills of banks which 18 have suspended s pecie payments. On the contrary, it is the representative of gold and s ilver, and convertible 19 into gold and silver on demand, and therefore answers the purposes of gold and silver; and so long as its credit 20 is in this way sustained, it is the cheapest, the bes t, and the most convenient circulating medium. I have already 21 endeavored to warn the country agains t irredeemable paper; against the pap er of ban ks which do not pay 22 specie for their own notes; against that miserable, abominable, and fraudulent policy, which attempts to give 23 value to any paper, of any bank, one single moment lo nger than such paper is redeemable on dema nd in gold 24 and silver. I wish most so 1emnly and earnestly to repeat that warning. I see danger of that state of things 25 ahead. I s ee imminent danger that a portion of the State banks will stop specie payments. The late measure of 26 the Secretary, and the infatuation with which it seems to be supported, tend directly and strongly to that result. 27 Under pretence, then, of a design to retu rn to a currency which shall be all specie, w e are likely to have a 28 currency in which there shall be no specie at all. We are in danger of being o verwhelmed with irredeemable 29 paper, mere paper, representing not gold nor silver; no, Sir, representing nothing but broken promi ses , bad 30 faith, bankrupt corporations, cheated creditors, a nd ruined people. Thi s, I fear, Sir, may be the consequence, 31 already alarmingly near, of this attempt, unwise if it be real, and gro ssly fraudulent if it be only pretended, of 32 establish ing an e xclu sively hard -money currency. 33 But, Sir, if this shock could be avoided, and if we could reach the object of an exclusive metallic circulation, we 34 should find in that very success serious and insurmountable inconveniences . We require neither irredeemable 35 paper , nor yet exclusively hard money. We req uire a mixed system. We require specie, a nd we require, too, 36 good bank paper, founded on specie, representing specie, and convertible in to specie on demand. We require, 37 in short, just such a currency as we have long enjoyed, and the advantages of which we s eem now, with 38 unaccountable rashne ss, about t o throw away. 39 [A Redeemable Paper Curren cy, Speech by Daniel Webster, Feb. 22, 1834 ; 40 SOURCE: http://famguardian.org/Subjects/MoneyBanking/Money/ARedeemablePaperCurrency- 18340222- 41 DanielWebster.pdf ] 42 3 What is “M oney”? 43 The legal definition of money found in Black’s Law Diction ary reads as follows: 44 Money.

You can read this case later in section 16.9 : 22 Congress, as the legislature of a sovereign nation, being expre ssly empowered by the constitution ‘to lay and 23 collect taxes, to pay the debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States,’ 24 and ‘to borrow money on the credit of the United States,’ and ‘to coin money and regulate the value thereof and 25 of foreign coin;’ and being clearly authorized, as incidental to the exercise of those great powers, to emit bills 26 of credit to charter national banks, and *450 to provide a national currency for the whole people, in the form of 27 coin, treasur y notes, and national bank bills; and the power to make the notes of the government a legal 28 tender in payment of private debts being one of the powers belonging to sovereignty in other civilized nations, 29 and not expressly withheld from congress by the cons titution; we are irresistibly impelled to the conclusion 30 that the impressing upon the treasury notes of the United States the quality of being a legal tender in 31 payment of private debts is an appropriate means, conducive and plainly adapted to the executio n of the 32 undoubted powers of congress, consistent with the letter and spirit of the constitution, and therefore within 33 the meaning of that instrument, ‘necessary and proper for carrying into execution the powers vested by this 34 constitution in the government of the United States. ’ 35 [Legal Tender Cases, 110 U.S. 421, 449- 450 (1884) ; SOURCE Section 16.9 later ] 36 The t rouble with our present debt -based currency system is that when the U.S. government issues obligations such as 37 Federal Reserve Notes, these notes become “money” and the government is no longer operating in a “public”, but rather a 38 “private” capacity. This was confirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court when it said: 39 \"What, then, is meant by the doctrine that contracts are made with reference to the taxing power resident in the 40 State, and in subordination to it?

That cannot be, because if 1 it could, the contract (in the language of Alexander Hamilton) would 'involve two contradictory things: an 2 obligation to do, and a right not to do; an obligation to pay a certain sum, and a right to retain it in the shape 3 of a tax. It is against the rules, both of la w and of reason, to admit by implication in the construction of a 4 contract a principle which goes in destruction of it.' The truth is, States and 5 cities, when they borrow money and contract to 6 repay it with interest, are not acting as 7 sovereignties . They c ome down to the level of ordinary individuals. Their contracts have the 8 same meaning as that of similar contracts between private persons. Hence, instead of there being in the 9 undertaking of a State or city to pay, a reservation of a sovereign right to withhold payment, the contract 10 should be regarded as an assurance that such a right will not be exercised. A promise to pay, with a 11 reserved right to deny or change the effect of the promise, is an 12 absurdity .\" 13 Is, then, property, which consists in the promis e of a State, or of a municipality of a State, beyond the reach of 14 taxation? We do not affirm that it is. A State may undoubtedly tax any of its creditors within its jurisdiction for 15 the debt due to him, and regulate the amount of the tax by the rate of in terest the debt bears, if its promise be 16 left unchanged. A tax thus laid impairs no obligation assumed. It leaves the contract untouched. But until 17 payment of the debt or interest has been made, as stipulated , we think no act of State sovereignty can work an 18 exoneration from what has been promised to the [446] creditor; namely, payment to him, without a violation 19 of the Constitution. 'The true rule of every case of property founded on contract with the government is this: 20 It must first be reduced into possession, and then it will become subject, in common with other similar 21 property, to the right of the government to raise contributions upon it. It may be said that the government 22 may fulfil this principle by paying the interest with one hand, and taking back the amount of the tax with the 23 other. But to this the answer is, that, to comply truly with the rule, the tax must be upon all the money of the 24 community, not upon the particular portion of it which is paid to the public creditors, and it ought besides to 25 be so regulated as not to include a lien of the tax upon the fund. The creditor should be no otherwise acted 26 upon than as every other possessor of money; and, consequently, the money he receives from the public 27 can then only be a fit subject of taxation w hen it is entirely 28 separated' (from the contract), 'and thrown undistinguished into 29 the common mass.' 3 Hamilton, Works, 514 et seq. Thus only can contracts with the State b e 30 allowed to have the same meaning as all other similar contracts have. 31 [Murray v. City of Charleston, 96 U.S. 432 (1877) ] 32 By simply printing more Federal Reserve Notes, then, the government is effectively borrowing from those people who hold 33 money already in circulation by increasing the supply of money and diluting the corresponding value of existing money. In 34 other words, when the U.S. Government prints more and more money, as it must do as it keeps borrowing more and more 35 money from the privately owned Federal Reserve Banks , it essentially is debasing the currency that is in circulation by 36 inflating the money supply. The U.S. Government steals the wealth of the American People by creating inflation so that in 37 real terms, money in circulation today, is worth less (it buys less) th an the same amount of money in circulation t en years 38 ago. 39 In that sense, there is at least an implied contract to repay those it has borrowed value against, which means that in relati on 40 to all those holding “cash” at the time that the supply of money was increased by issuing more, then the government is 41 acting in a private and not public capacity and a mere private creditor with a fiduciary duty to repay the money . 42 The Legal Tender Cases holding earlier occurred at a time when promissory note s issued by the government that were the 43 subject of the case were still redeemable in gold or silver. Redeemability ended officially by Executive fiat in 1971 through 44 President Nixon’s Presidential Proclamation 4074. Since the enactment of the Federal Reserve Act in 1913 , the U.S. 45 Supreme Court has very deliberately and systematically never since ruled on or heard any cases that would address any of 46 the following important questions. We allege that if the Supreme Court had accepted their Constitutional duty to address 47 the following questions since the Federal Reserve Act was enacted in 1913, the Federal Reserve would have b een declared 48 unconstitutional long ago: 49"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":" The Money Scam 17 of 120 Copyright Sovereignty Education and Defense Ministry, http://sedm.org Form 05.041, Rev. 10- 18- 200 9 EXHIBIT:________ 1.

The nature of that emergency is described later in section 4 6.7 . 5 2. How can a state of contrived national emergency lawfully be maintained as a justification to suspend redeemability? 6 The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled previously that NO NATIONAL EMERGENCY justifies a suspension of the 7 Constitution. 8 Emergency does not create power. Emergency does not increase granted power or remove or d iminish the 9 restrictions imposed upon power granted or reserved. The Constitution was adopted in a period of grave 10 emergency. Its grants of power to the federal government and its limitations of the power of the States were 11 determined in the light of emergency, and they are not altered by emergency. What power was thus granted 12 and what limitations were thus imposed are questions [290 U.S. 398, 426] which have always been, and 13 always will be, the subject of close examination under our constitutional sys tem. 14 While emergency does not create power, emergency may furnish the occasion for the exercise of power. 15 'Although an emergency may not call into life a power which has never lived, nevertheless emergency may 16 afford a reason for the exertion of a living power already enjoyed.'

Here is the way one monetary expert describes 32 it: 33 “...Gold has the same role to play in the monetary system as the fly -wheel regulator does in an engine, the 34 brake does in a train, and circuit -breakers do in an electrical network. Gold is the regulator of the quantity of 35 debt in the economy that can be safely created and carried. It is also safeguarding quality by rejecting toxic 36 debt before it can start metastasis. Debt- based currency utterly lacks safeguards limiting quantity and vouching 37 for quality of debt. Debt- based currency is an invitation to disaster, tha t of the toppling of the Tower of Babel. 38 Its effects are far from being instantaneous. There is a threshold and there is a critical mass involved. We have 39 long since crossed that threshold and passed that critical mass. By no rational calculus can the outs tanding 40 debt be expected to be repaid without inflationary or deflationary adventures, even if further increase were 41 stopped dead in its track. The discussion of the present financial crisis by academia and media avoids all 42 reference to this fact. Under th e gold standard a fast -breeder of debt was unthinkable, and debt was retired in 43 an orderly manner. ” 44 [“The Gold Standard Strikes Back......With A 36 -Year Lag ”, Professor Antal Fekete essay ] 45 The redeemability of money in substance was officially ended in 1971. Using Professor Fekete’s metaphors, with the 46 regulator of debt now disabled, the brakes discarded, and the circuit breakers removed, it is now understandable, as the last 47 and final act of our financial drama plays out, why we now find ourselves buried beneath unbearable and unpayable 48 quantities of toxic debt. 49 Removing g old from the international monetary system in 1971 allowed the US to then begin issuing US dollars in 50 increasingly excessive amounts as the US was no longer constrained by gold to maintain any semblance of fiscal restraint 51 or discipline . 52"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":" The Money Scam 19 of 120 Copyright Sovereignty Education and Defense Ministry, http://sedm.org Form 05.041, Rev. 10- 18- 200 9 EXHIBIT:________ While consequences may be delayed they cannot be avoided.

As the Federa l Reserve Bank of Chicago has so aptly 14 stated in its publication, Modern Money Mechanics, Form #11.509 : 15 \"The actual process of money creation takes place in the banks. As noted earlier, checkable liabilities of banks 16 are money. These liabilities are customers' accounts. They increase when the customers deposit currency and 17 checks and when the proceeds of loans made by the banks are credited to borrowers' accounts. 18 \"In the absence of legal reserve requirements, banks can build up deposits by increasing loans and investments 19 so long as they keep enough currency on hand to redeem whatever amounts the holders of deposits want to 20 convert into currency.\" 21 [Modern Money Mechanics , Form #11.509, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago ; 22 SOURCE: http://famguardian.org/Subjects/MoneyBanking/Money/ModernMoneyMechanics/mmm2.htm ] 23 Thus, banks simply extend credit when loan s are made. The \"currency\" for which these and all others loans in America can 24 be redeemed is known as the Federal Reserve Note (\"FRN\"). 25 The creation of money within banks is regulated by the Federal Reserve Board . See: 26 Federal Reserve Website http://www.federalreserve.gov/ All banks which participate in the Federal Reserve System are called “national bank s”. Title 12 of the U.S. Code regulates 27 the activities of all national banks. The following provisions make these national banks into “agents of the U.S. 28 government”: 29 TITLE 12 > CHAPTER 2 > SUBCHAPTER IV > § 90 30 § 90. Depositaries of public moneys and financial agents of Government 31 All national banking associations, designated for that purpose by the Secretary of the Treas ury, shall be 32 depositaries of public money, under such regulations as may be prescribed by the Secretary; and they may 33 also be employed as financial agents of the Government; and they shall perform all such reasonable duties, 34 as depositaries of public money and financial agents of the Government, as may be required of them . The 35 Secretary of the Treasury shall require the associations thus designated to give satisfactory security, by the 36 deposit of United States bonds and otherwise, for the safe- keeping and prompt payment of the public money 37 deposited with them, and for the faithful performance of their duties as financial agents of the Government: 38 Provided, That the Secretary shall, on or before the 1st of January of each year, make a public statement of the 39 securities required during that year for such deposits. And every association so designated as receiver or 40 depositary of the public money shall take and receive at par all of the national currency bills, by whatever 41 association issued, which have been pai d into the Government for internal revenue, or for loans or stocks: 42 Provided, That the Secretary of the Treasury shall distribute the deposits herein provided for, as far as 43 practicable, equitably between the different States and sections. 44 Any national ba nking association may, upon the deposit with it of any funds by any State or political 45 subdivision thereof or any agency or other governmental instrumentality of one or more States or political 46"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":" The Money Scam 20 of 120 Copyright Sovereignty Education and Defense Ministry, http://sedm.org Form 05.041, Rev. 10- 18- 200 9 EXHIBIT:________ subdivisions thereof, including any officer, employee, or agen t thereof in his official capacity, give security for 1 the safekeeping and prompt payment of the funds so deposited to the same extent and of the same kind as is 2 authorized by the law of the State in which such association is located in the case of other ba nking institutions 3 in the State. 4 Any national banking association may, upon the deposit with it of any funds by any federally recognized Indian 5 tribe, or any officer, employee, or agent thereof in his or her official capacity, give security for the safekeeping 6 and prompt payment of the funds so deposited by the deposit of United States bonds and otherwise as may be 7 prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury for public funds under the first paragraph of this section. 8 Notwithstanding the Federal Property a nd Administrative Services Act of 1949 , as amended, the Secretary may 9 select associations as financial agents in accordan ce with any process the Secretary deems appropriate and 10 their reasonable duties may include the provision of electronic benefit transfer services (including State- 11 administered benefits with the consent of the States), as defined by the Secretary. 12 Even among banks that are not “national banks”, those which accept FDIC insurance also become agents of the U.S. 13 government.

Printing press money is engraved on special paper and with special inks ; and 12 it costs about eight one -thousandths of 1 cent per bill, whether a $1 bill or a $10,000 bill. Pen -and- ink money is 13 created by a private banker simply by making ink marks on the books of the bank.

Bank profits come from interest on the money lent and invested, while the cost of creating money is 21 negligible. (Banks do incur costs, of course, from bookkeeping to loan officers' salaries.)

There is no charge,\" 23 Id., at 89. 24 \"Since I had also seen reports that the member banks of the Federal Reserve System had a certain number of 25 millions of dollars in 'cash reserves' on deposit with the Federal Reserve bank, I then asked if I might be 26 allowed to see these cash reserves.

The cash, in truth, does not exist and 28 never has existed. What are called cash reserves are simply bookkeeping credits entered into the ledgers of the 29 Federal Reserve banks.

They create money out of nothing using a book 16 keeping entry and the amount they create is regulated by the Federal Reserve. They are allowed to loan out 90% of the 17 amount they have on deposit and must keep ten percent in reserve. The percentage o f reserves that national banks must 18 maintain determines how much money they can loan out. Money creation occurs when: 1. F ederal Reserve Banks buy 19 government securities ; 2. Banks loan money the 90% of their deposits . Every purchase of government securi ties and every 20 loan increases the money in circulation.

To make change the dollar was actually cut into eight pieces or \"bits .\" Thus came the terms \"pieces of 7 eight\" from these early times and \"two bits\" from our time. 8 6.3.1 Colonial and Continental Currency 9 The Massachusetts Bay Colony issued the first paper money in the colonies in 1690. Other colonies soon followed suit to 10 meet the high demand for money fueled by trade between the colonies and the scarcity of coin (which was the common 11 form of money up to this date). Some of this early money was readily accepted, but some was not redeemed in gold or 12 silver as promised and thus depre ciated rapidly. These currencies, however, set a precedent for the first national currency 13 which was issued during the War for Independence. 14 To finance the Revolutionary War, the Continental Congress in 1775 authorized the limited issuance of paper currency. 15 These notes, called Continentals, were denominated in dollars and backed by the \"anticipation\" of future tax revenues, with 16 no backing in silver or gold. They could be redeemed only upon the independence of the colonies. 17 Figure 8: Continental One Third Dollar, 1776 18"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":" The Money Scam 31 of 120 Copyright Sovereignty Education and Defense Ministry, http://sedm.org Form 05.041, Rev. 10- 18- 200 9 EXHIBIT:________ 1 Figure 9: Continental Currency, 65 dollars 2 3 Continentals were an interesting expression of the new nation's sovereignty, as they did not feature pictures of the crown or 4 King of England.

The Continental was significant, however, in 2 that it marked the first time that the worth of U.S. currency lay in its purchasing power and not in its intrinsic value. 3 6.3.2 Gold and Silver Certificates 4 The economy was in turmoil in the late 19th century. The government, in a move to increase its reserve of precious metals, 5 offered certificates in exchange for deposits of silver and gold. 6 Gold certificates, colorful and vivid, were first issued in 1863 and put into gene ral circulation in 1882. They are among the 7 most attractive of all currency issues, with the reverse a brilliant golden orange, symbolic of the gold coin they represent. In 8 1933, when the country faced a severe depression and a banking crisis, the public began to demand gold. 9 Runs developed on both Federal Reserve Banks (which had been established under the Federal Reserve Act in 1913) and 10 commercial banks. In order to deal with this crisis, only Federal Reserve Banks were permitted to hold gold. In 1934, 11 Federal Reserve Banks were required to turn over all gold coin, bullion, and certificates to the U.S. Treasury in return for a 12 new type of gold certificate. These were never put into circulation and the last ones were printed in January 1935. In 1964, 13 priv ate citizens could once again hold gold certificates issued before January 30, 1934, but they could no longer be 14 redeemed in gold. This changed in 1974, and private U.S. citizens could once again hold gold legally. 15 Silver certificates were first issued in exchange for silver dollars in 1878. They offered many varieties of design and subject 16 matter including inventors, military heroes, a Sioux Indian, and the famous Educational series of 1896. An 1886 $1 silver 17 certificate is also the only piece of U.S. pap er currency to bear the portrait of a woman --Martha Washington. 18 For many years silver certificates were the major type of currency in circulation. However, in the early 1960s when the 19 price of silver jumped to over $1.29 an ounce it was evident that further increases would make it profitable for holders of 20 silver coins to sell them in the open market. To avert this crisis, Congress eliminated silver certificates in 1963, and 21 empowered the Federal Reserve to issue $1 and $2 Federal Reserve Notes for the fir st time. 22 Figure 10: Silver Certificate, series 1878 , $100 23 24 Figure 11: Series 1880 $1,000 Note 25"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":" The Money Scam 33 of 120 Copyright Sovereignty Education and Defense Ministry, http://sedm.org Form 05.041, Rev. 10- 18- 200 9 EXHIBIT:________ 1 Figure 12: Gold Certificate, 1882 , $500 2 3 6.3.3 National Bank, 1863- 1921 4 President Abra ham Lincoln, urged by the Secretary of the Treasury, convinced Congress to pass the National Banking Act 5 in 1863 which establ ished a national banking system and a uniform national currency to be issued by the new \"national 6 banks.\" The banks were required to purchase U.S. government securities as backing for their National Bank Notes. In 1865 7 a 10 -percent tax was levied on State Bank notes eliminating the profit in issuing them and basically taxing them out of 8 existence. 9 Although United States Notes were still widely accepted as a medium of exchange, most paper currency circulating 10 between the Civil War and World War I consisted of National Bank Notes. They were issued from 1863 through 1932. 11 From 1863 to 1877 National Bank Notes were printed by private bank note companies under contract to the Federal 12 government. The Federal government took over printing them in 1877. 13 Figure 13: National Bank Currency, 1919- 1921, $50 14"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":" The Money Scam 34 of 120 Copyright Sovereignty Education and Defense Ministry, http://sedm.org Form 05.041, Rev. 10- 18- 200 9 EXHIBIT:________ 1 6.4 1913: Federal Reserve Act 2 The Federal Reserve Act of 1913 , 38 Stat. 251 Chapter 6 , was intended to provide a system of up to a maximum of twelve 3 reserve banks as an adjunct to the previously existing but independent National Banks which were banks of issue. The 4 various Federal R eserve banks were organized and created by the pres -existing National Banks in a reserve district as the 5 stockholders of the Federal reserve bank which was created in their district. A primary function of the Federal r eserve 6 banks was to act as a reserve bank for the member banks in each district, and as such there was no need for the Federal 7 reserve banks of issue. But under Federal Reserve Act , 38 Stat. 268 -269 , Section 18 , the various Federal reserve banks 8 could issue circulating notes of the same tenor and under nearly identical terms and conditions as the circulating notes of 9 the nation al banks. 10 In 1913 a major change in paper currency occurred with the passage of the Federal Reserve Act aimed at resolving some 11 long -standing money and banking problems which had led to bank failures, business bankruptcies, and general economic 12 contraction s. The Act created the Federal Reserve System as the nation's central bank to regulate the flow of money and 13 credit for economic stability and growth. In 1914, Federal Reserve Notes, which comprise more than 99 percent of today's 14 paper money, were issued by Federal Reserve Banks as direct obligations of the Federal Reserve System. They replaced 15 National Bank Notes as the dominant form of paper money. 16 Federal Reserve Notes were issued in denominations ranging from $1 to $10,000. The $100 note has been the largest 17 denomination printed since 1946, and in 1969 all notes greater than $100 were retired because of declining demand. 18 The design of Federal Reserve Notes has changed little over the years. In 1929, the size of the notes was reduced; in 1955, 19 the inscr iption \"In God We Trust\" was added; and in 1966, the Latin wording on the Treasury seal was replaced by an 20 English translation. In 1929, it was also decided that all currency would have a portrait on the front, and denominations 21 under $100 would have buildings or monuments on the back. Higher denominations had the denomination on the back. 22 Federal Reserve notes, which comprise more than 99 percent of today's paper currency, were first issued by Federal 23 Reserve Banks in 1914. The Federal Reserve System was established by the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, which, in part, 24 called for the creation of an independent central bank to furnish an elastic money supply that would expand and contract in 25 response to the economy's changing demand for money. Such flexibilit y in the financial system acts as a stabilizing 26 influence on prices and credit in the economy. 27 Below is a “National Currency” note issued pursuant to Federal Reserve Act, Section 18: 28 Figure 14: Federal Reserve Bank Note, 1918 , $2 29"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":" The Money Scam 35 of 120 Copyright Sovereignty Education and Defense Ministry, http://sedm.org Form 05.041, Rev. 10- 18- 200 9 EXHIBIT:________ 1 2 The above is an example of a note authorized by the Federal Reserve Act to be issued by a Federal “reserve bank” as a note 3 of general circulation.

Then, notice that those “Federal reserve notes” could be issued by the “Federal 7 Reserve Board ”, NOT by any bank per se; for a one singular purpose, namely, “for the purpose of making advances TO 8 Federal reserve banks -and for no other purpose”. 9 That sounds as though the small “r” type of “Federal reserve notes” could be issued by a Federal reserve bank ONLY to a 10 Federal reserve bank maybe in aid of a reserve requirement, but not for issuance by a Federal reserve bank as a note of 11 general circulation. Certainly, by this section 16 there is no authority fo r the issuance of any Federal Reserve Notes as a 12 note of general circulation. 13 As a guess, it is doubtful that any “Federal reserve notices” pursuant to section 16 have ever been created.

And look to Butler v. U.S., 296 U.S. 1 to find that the Agricultural Adjustment Act was declared 3 unconstitut ional and void. But for the purpose here let’s study that one paragraph in some detail. A copy of HJR -192 4 appears later in section 16.4 . 5 What exactly was made a legal tend er by way of HJR -192? First off, we see in a parenthetical insertion the language of 6 “including Federal Reserve notes and circulating notes of the Federal Reserve banks and national banking associations.” 7 None of those had ever been of a legal tender stat us before HJR -192. As for the coins minted by the United States, they 8 were already of a “lawful money” status and “legal tender” status as for coins was superfluous, except that what was stated 9 in section 1 of HJR -192 made it necessary. The gold coins, y ou might have heard, were recalled and withdrawn from 10 general circulation, which reduced the overall money supply and exacerbated the depth and length of the depression. 11 Because the last paragraph of HJR -192 specifically included all Federal Reserve notes “heretofore or hereafter —issued” 12 those two Federal Reserve notes (series of 1914 and 1918) became capital “R” Reserve notes by way of a Resolution of 13 Congress as expressed in HJR -192, and that’s when those two and all others like them became legal tender, in June of 1933. 14 6.7 1972: Executive End of Redeemability of Silver 15 Redeemability of notes in silver ended officially in August 17, 1971 with Presidential Proclamation 4074 . This was done 16 under the authority of 12 U. S.C. §95b, which granted legislative authority to the President. This statute unlawfully and 17 unconstitutionally delegated lawmaking powers to the President and violates the separation of power s doctrine . Article 2, 18 Section 2 of the United States Constitution establishes the Office of President of the United States of America, but 12 19 U.S.C. §95b refers to the “Presiden t of the United States”, who is NOT the same person.

They would have to admit that they have foisted a FRAUD upon Americans in relation to the money system since 1933 1 when FDR started this mess with the Emergency Bank ing Relief Act . 2 In that sense, a national emergency which bega n in 1933 continues to this day to justify an ongoing violation of the 3 Constitution in regards to the requirements of our money system. Of this travesty of justice, American Jurisprudence legal 4 encyclopedia says: 5 “ No emergency justifies the violation of any of the provisions of the United States Constitution. 5 An 6 emergency, however, while it cannot create power, increase granted power, or remove or diminish the 7 restrictions imposed upon the power granted or reserved, may allow the exercise of power already in existence, 8 but not exercised except during an emergency. 6 9 The circumstances in which the executive branch may exercise extraordinary powers under t he Constitution are 10 very narrow. 7 The danger must be immediate and impending, or the necessity urgent for the public service, 11 such as will not admit of delay, and where the action of the civil authority would be too late in providing the 12 means which the o ccasion calls for. 8 For example, there is no basis in the Constitution for the seizure of steel 13 mills during a wartime labor dispute, despite the President's claim that the war effort would be crippled if the 14 mills were shut down. 9 ” 15 [16 Am.Jur.2d , Cons titution al Law , §52] 16 The internal taxation within the states that violates the Constitution and stabilizes and sustains this national emergency we re 17 also never intended by the Founding Fathers: 18 \" Madison’s Notes on the Constitutional Convention [see Federalist Paper #45 ] reveal clearly that the 19 framers of the Constitution believed for some time [and wrote this permanent requirement into the 20 Constitution] that the principal, if not sole, support of the new Federal Government would be derived from 21 customs duties and taxes connected with shipping and importations. Internal taxation would not be resorted 22 to except infrequently, and for special [emergency] reasons. The first resort to internal taxation, the 23 enactment of internal revenue laws in 1791 and in the following 10 years, was occasioned by the exigencies of 24 the public credit. These first laws were repealed in 1802. Internal revenue laws were reenacted for the period 25 1813- 17, when the effects of the war of 1812 caused Congress to resort to internal taxation. From 1818 to 26 1861, however, the United States had no internal revenue laws and the Federal Government was supported by 27 the revenue from import duties and the proceeds from the sale of public lands. In 1862 Congress once more 28 levied internal revenue taxes. This time the establishmen t of an internal revenue system, not exclusively 29 dependent upon the supplies of foreign commerce, was permanent.\" 30 [IRS publication of Regulations, Federal Register, Volume 37, page 20960 dated October 5, 1972 ] 31 This is the same FRAUD that Hitler pulled in order to take over Germany.

Isn't this illegal? 5 The pertinent portion of l aw that applies to your question is the Coinage Act of 1965 , specifically Section 31 6 U.S.C. 5103, entitled \"Legal tender,\" which states: \"United States coins and currency (including Federal reserve notes and ci rculating 7 notes of Federal reserve banks and national banks) are legal tender for all debts, public charges, taxes, and dues.\" 8 This statute means that all United States money as identified above are a valid and legal offer of payment for debts when ten dered to a 9 creditor. There is, however, no Federal statute mandating that a private business, a person or an organization must accept 10 currency or coins as for payment for goods and/or services. Private businesses are free to develop their own policies on 11 whether or not to accept cash unless there is a State law which says otherwise. For example, a bus line may prohibit payment 12 of fares in pennies or dollar bills. In addition, movie theaters, convenience stores and gas stations may refuse to accept la rge 13 denomination currency (usually notes above $20) as a matter of policy. 14 [SOURCE : Legal Tender Status, United States Dept. of Treasury Website; http://www.ustreas.gov/education/faq/currency/legal - 15 tender.shtml 16 The same statute (P.L. 97 -258) which created section 5103 also contains a lengthy listin g of laws and statute which were 17 expressly repealed.

In addition to scarcity, the fact that both are metals further 31 adds to their usefulness as money. A scarce metal is the most obvious form of money imaginable in that it is indestructible 32 in comparison to pre cious stones, agricultural commodities and especially paper, and this indestructibility gives to it long 33 life as a medium of exchange and thus it is capable of surviving all sorts of calamities, including changes in government. 34 Further, gold and silver are ideally suited for use as a medium of exchange in that both are easily divisible; by being 35 divisible, a bar of gold or silver can be divided into smaller units with relative ease. Therefore, gold and silver, being hi ghly 36 malleable precious metals which co nsume relatively little space in storage are ideally suited as no other substance on this 37 earth to be used as money. 38 The value of gold and silver as a medium of exchange was quickly learned by man. The oldest known history book, the 39 Bible, is replete with references to gold and silver as money. The Bible discloses land being sold for gold and silver coin, 40 trade and commerce being conducted through the use of this medium, wars being fought to acquire this metal, taxes being 41 exacted in coin and, most importa ntly, tithes being paid in gold and silver coin. Judas betrayed Christ for the price of silver 42 coins. While mention of gold and silver as money in the Bible is everywhere, no reference to paper as money is to be found. 43 The history of virtually every ancie nt nation and empire reveals use of gold and silver coin as money. Some students of 44 monetary history assert the proposition that nations attain greatness in part through the use of gold and silver in pure form 45 as money. So long as ancient nations and state s operated on a pure form of specie money, they retained the viability of their 46 societies as well as their trade and commerce. However, when such societies allowed the debasement of their coin by either 47"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":" The Money Scam 44 of 120 Copyright Sovereignty Education and Defense Ministry, http://sedm.org Form 05.041, Rev. 10- 18- 200 9 EXHIBIT:________ the national monarch or a private group, societal dec ay occurred, that nation quickly lost its strength and was either 1 conquered or otherwise destroyed and became a part of history. 2 Delving deeper, it is quite easy to see how an adverse change in an ancient and established monetary system presages social 3 destruction. Monarchs and rulers of ancient civilizations always sought to acquire wealth and power, and the ability to 4 direct economic activity. The method for doing such was always ready at hand: the monetary system. These rulers, princes 5 and monarchs woul d debase the coin coming through their treasuries by blending the precious metals with baser metals in 6 order to have more coins to spend. Operating under this unsound supposition, these unprincipled rulers would soon debase 7 the ancient monetary standard, and the result would always be social ruin. 8 Another method demonstrated in history through which monarchs attempted to gain wealth and power involved delegation 9 of certain powers over the national monetary system to certain private interests. The lifeblood of any nation is its monetary 10 system; however, whenever any nation's monetary system has been delivered into the hands of any private group, that 11 private group has always manipulated the monetary system for its own benefit at the expense of the rest of society. Social 12 ruin is always the natural and proximate result of such an unlawful delegation of monetary powers to a private group. 13 There are certain medieval monetary scholars of considerable note who established certain basic premises for any monetary 14 system, one of whom was Bishop Nicholas Oresme. Bishop Oresme wrote a book in Latin in the 14th century, De 15 Moneta , which discussed the basic parameters for any just and lawful monetary system. According to Oresme, \"money\" 16 could only be gold and silver coin, as it had always been in every society except those of a primitive nature. The basic 17 premises of Oresme's treatise were that the monarch should coin the money, but he could not, without certain limited and 18 just reasons, alter the coin, change its form or name, change the ratio of exchange between the precious metals, change the 19 weight or material of the coins, or otherwise unjustly profit by any method of changing the basic monetary unit of a society. 20 To do any of these, according to Oresme, was an act of tyranny: 21 \"I am of opinion that the main and final cause why the prince pretends to the power of altering the coinage is 22 the profit or gain which he c an get from it. 23 \"Therefore, from the moment when the prince unjustly usurps this essentially unjust privilege, it is impossible 24 that he can justly take profit from it. Besides, the amount of the prince's profit is necessarily that of the 25 community's loss. But whatever loss the prince inflicts on the community is injustice and the act of a tyrant and 26 not of a king * * * 27 \"And so the prince would be at length able to draw to himself almost all the money or riches of his subjects and 28 reduce them to slavery. A nd this would be tyrannical, indeed true and absolute tyranny.\" 29 Bishop Oresme is probably the least known monetary scholar in history. Nonetheless, the timeless, permanent monetary 30 maxims so ably demonstrated by Oresme are clearly embodied in the framework of the common law as regards money. 31 Insofar as the common law is concerned, there are many instances of English monarchs attempting to violate Oresme's 32 monetary principles. Some examples of these unfortunate endeavors quickly demonstrate the fallacy of any attempt to 33 debase coin. King Edward IV, during the time of his reign, determined that the English nation was plagued by various 34 impure coins of sundry weights. One of the outstanding achievements of Edward IV was to perfect the standard of coin of 35 the r ealm, which produced excellent results. Subsequently during the reigns of Henry VI and Henry VIII, these extravagant 36 kings sought monetary gain by debasement of the coin of the realm, which attempts produced adverse results not only for 37 the nation but for the monarchs themselves as well. When Queen Elizabeth succeeded her father, Henry VIII, she restored 38 Edward's ancient standard and thereafter during her reign resisted the advice of her ministers to engage in debasement. Her 39 efforts at monetary order produced very favorable results. 40 Of particular importance to the subject of the American constitutional monetary standard are two periods during the 17th 41 century. One such period was in 1626. In 1625, after the death of King James I, Charles I assumed the thro ne and was faced 42 with a less than compliant Parliament. Needing money, Charles sought to engage in the old fashioned method of coin 43 debasement, but here he met stiff resistance. In September of 1626, Sir Robert Cotton addressed the Privy Council and 44 expres sed his opposition to any attempt to debase the coin: 45 \"And wealth in every Kingdom is one of the essential Marks of their Greatness: And that is best expressed in the 46 Measure and Purity of their Monies. Hence was it, that so long as the Roman Empire (a Pa ttern of best 47 Government) held up their Glory and Greatness, they ever maintained, with little or no change, the Standard of 48"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":" The Money Scam 45 of 120 Copyright Sovereignty Education and Defense Ministry, http://sedm.org Form 05.041, Rev. 10- 18- 200 9 EXHIBIT:________ their Coin. But after the loose times of Commodus had led in Need by Excess, and so that Shift of Changing the 1 Standard, the Majest y of that Empire fell by degrees. And as Vopiscus saith, the steps by which that State 2 descended, were visibly known most by the gradual Alteration of their coin; and there is no surer symptom of a 3 Consumption in State, than the Corruption in Money. 4 \"To a void the Trick of Permutation, Coin was devised as a Rate and Measure of Merchandize and 5 Manufactures; which if mutable, no Man can tell either what he hath, or what he oweth; no Contract can be 6 certain; and so all Commerce, both publick and private, destr oyed; and Men again enforced to Permutation 7 with things not subject to Wit or Fraud. 8 \"Experience hath taught us, that the enfeebling of Coin is but a shift for a while, as Drink to one in a Dropsie, 9 to make him swell the more; But the State was never thor oughly cured, as we saw by Henry the Eighth's time 10 and the late Queens, until the Coin was made rich again.\" 11 As a result of the study made in 1626 concerning debasement, a report was issued which stated that debasement served no 12 purpose other than injustic e and the decision was made against any attempt to debase. The argument against debasement 13 was cogently stated as follows: 14 \"The Measures in a Kingdom ought to be constant: It is the Justice and Honour of the King; for if they be 15 altered, all Men at that instant are deceived in their precedent Contracts, either for Lands or Mony, and the 16 King most of all; for no Man knoweth then, either what he hath or what he oweth.\" 17 Thus having his efforts to debase denied to him, Charles sought other methods for raising revenue to finance his wars upon 18 the continent. The expedient upon which he chose was forced loans made by seizing coin in the Tower of London. Five 19 Knights were incarcerated for their refusal to acknowledge the forced loans. This brought controversy with the Parliament, 20 the net result of which was the Petition of Right of 1628, which denied to the King the inherent right to make forced loans. 21 The Petition was the final straw that caused Charles to disband Parliament for 12 years during which he conducted his 22 personal rule of England. When Parliament was finally reconvened in 1640, the \"Long Parliament\" produced the Grand 23 Remonstrance. The implacability of Charles eventually lead to the Civil War, which ended in rule by Oliver Cromwell. The 24 moral of the stor y here is that attempts to debase the coin and make forced loans eventually can cause the ultimate 25 destruction of society, civil war. 26 The second period of the 17th century of importance to this issue is that shortly after the Glorious Revolution of 1688 when 27 William and Mary assumed the English throne. By 1691, there was a great debate concerning the alleged need to once 28 again debase the coin of the realm. Between 1691 and 1695, John Locke, whose writings had considerable impact upon our 29 founding fathers, wrote three treatises against the proposal to debase the coin of the realm by the small percentage of 5%. In 30 these treatises, Locke made the following cogent arguments: 31 \"For an ounce of silver, whether in pence, groats, or crown pieces, stivers, or ducato ons, or in bullion, is, and 32 always eternally will be, of equal value to any other ounce of silver, under what stamp or denomination soever. 33 \"All then that can be done in this great mystery of raising money, is only to alter the denomination, and call that 34 a crown now, which before, by the law, was but a part of a crown. 35 \"The quantity of silver, that is in each piece, or species of coin, being that which makes its real and intrinsic 36 value, the due proportions of silver ought to be kept in each species, according to the respective rate, set on 37 each of them by law. And when this is ever varied from, it is but a trick to serve some present occasion, but is 38 always with loss to the country where the trick is played * * * For it not being the denomination, but th e 39 quantity of silver, that gives the value to any coin. 40 \"Silver, i.e. the quantity of pure silver, separable from the alloy, makes the real value of money. If it does not, 41 coin copper with the same stamp and denomination and see whether it will be of the same value. I suspect your 42 stamp will make it of no more worth than the copper money of Ireland is, which is its weight in copper and no 43 more. 44 \"The stamp was a warranty of the public that, under such a denomination, they should receive a piece of such a 45 weight, and such a fineness; that is, they should receive so much silver. And this is the reason why the 46 counterfeiting the stamp is made the highest crime, and has the weight of treason laid upon it; because the 47 stamp is the public voucher of the intrinsic value. The royal authority gives the stamp, the law allows and 48 confirms the denomination, and both together give, as it were, the public faith, as a security, that sums of money 49 contracted for under such denominations shall be of such a value, that is, shall have in them so much silver; for 50 it is silver, and not names, that pays debts, and purchases commodities. 51"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":" The Money Scam 46 of 120 Copyright Sovereignty Education and Defense Ministry, http://sedm.org Form 05.041, Rev. 10- 18- 200 9 EXHIBIT:________ \"Money is the measure of commerce, and of the rate of every thing, and therefore ought to be kept (as all other 1 measures) as steady and invariabl e as may be. 2 \"It is the interest of every country, that all the current money of it should be of one and the same metal; that the 3 several species should be of the same alloy, and none of a baser mixture; and that the standard, once thus 4 settled, should be inviolably and immutably kept to perpetuity. For whenever that is altered, upon what pretence 5 soever, the public will lose by it.\" 6 As a result of the debate concerning the proposal to debase coin, Parliament refused to adopt it. Some 23 years later, 7 Parli ament enacted in January, 1718, a resolution that stated there shall not be any alteration made to the ancient coin 8 standard of England. 9 One of the most significant expositions of the common law of England, and therefore the heritage of American law, 10 cons ists of Sir William Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England . In Blackstone's ex haustive treatment of the 11 common law, he aptly stated the common law concerning money : 12 \"Money is an universal medium, or common standard, by comparison with which the value of all merchandize 13 may be ascertained: or it is sign, which represents the respective values of all commodities. Metals are well 14 calculated for this sign, because they are durable and are capable of many subdivisions: and a precious metal 15 is still better calculated for this purpose, because it is the most portable. A metal is also the most proper for a 16 common measure, because it can easily be reduced to the same standard in all nations: and every particular 17 nation fixes on it its own impression, that the weight and standard (wherein consists the intrinsic value) may 18 both be known by inspection only. 19 \"The coining of money is in all states the act of the sovereign power; for the reason just mentioned, that it's 20 value may be known on inspection. And with respect to co inage in general, there are three things to be 21 considered therein; the materials, the impression, and the denomination. 22 \"With regard to the materials, Sir Edward Coke lays it down, that the money of England must either be of gold 23 or silver; and none other was ever issued by the royal authority till 1762, when copper farthings and half pence 24 were coined by King Charles the Second * * * But this copper coin is not upon the same footing with the other 25 in many respects * * * 26 \"As to the impression, the stampin g thereof is the unquestionable prerogative of the crown * * * 27 \"The denomination, or the value for which the coin is to pass current, is likewise in the breast of the king * * * 28 In order to fix the value, the weight and the fineness of the metal are to be taken into consideration together. 29 When a given weight of gold or silver is of a given fineness, it is then of the true standard, and called sterling 30 metal * * * And of this sterling metal all the coin of the kingdom must be made, by the statute 25 Edw. I II c. 13 31 (Coinage, 1351). So that the king's prerogative seemeth not to extend to the debasing or inhancing the value of 32 the coin, below or above the sterling value * * * The king may also, by his proclamation, legitimate foreign 33 coin, and make it current here; declaring at what value it shall be taken in payments. But this, I apprehend, 34 ought to be by comparison with the standard of our own coin; otherwise the consent of parliament will be 35 necessary.\" 36 From the above authorities of Bishop Oresme, Sir Robert Cotton, John Locke and Blackstone the basic parameters of a just 37 monetary system can be discovered as well as a concise summary of the common law of money. History and these 38 authorities demonstrate that gold and silver coin was always money and these subs tances alone were money and will 39 always be; and the common law sanctioned no other medium of exchange other than gold and silver coin of the standard as 40 determined by Edward. Further, debasement of the specie coin of any nation is unjust and unlawful, and was expressly 41 forbidden by the common law. Thus, the refined essence of the common law was that gold and silver alone were money, 42 and the coins so minted had to conform to the ancient and established standard coin of the realm; further, this standard was 43 immutable and could not be debased. 10 44 7.2 Colonial Monetary Experiments 45 The actions of Charles I in dismissing Parliament in 1628 and thereafter conducting his personal rule of England for 12 46 years was a primary cause of the exodus of English citizens to the New World, America, in the early 17th century. 47 However, conditions then in this country were primitive to say the least, and the colonies were controlled by English 48   10 For a more definitive treatment of this subject and period of time, reference is made to \"The Gold Clause Cases in the Light of History,\" 23 Georgetown Law Journal 359 (1935), and Edwin Vieira's fine work, Pieces of Eight, The Monetary Powers and Dis abilities of the United States Constitution."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":" The Money Scam 47 of 120 Copyright Sovereignty Education and Defense Ministry, http://sedm.org Form 05.041, Rev. 10- 18- 200 9 EXHIBIT:________ governors and the monopolistic privileges granted by the Crown to particular court favorites. Trade with the mother 1 country, England, was especially one sided to the detriment of the colonies and their citizens, and this created a shortage o f 2 a medium of exchange, especially gold and silver coin. Barter was extensively used to consummate trade, and agricultural 3 products such as tobacco, cattle, land, wampum and other items were used as a substitute \"legal tender.\" 4 The first paper money experiment in colonial America occurred in 1690 when Massachusetts, anticipating a need to pay 5 soldiers sent to w ar in Canada, made the first emission of paper money. After the soldiers returned from this unsuccessful 6 invasion attempt, they received their pay in this scrip; see Craig v. Missouri , 29 U.S. 410 (1830) . The direct result of this 7 improvident experiment brought Gresham's Law (\"bad money drives out good money\") into operation and such specie as 8 existed in the colony soon departed for use in England. Notwithstanding the apparent adverse effects of paper emissions, 9 the supposed short term benefit was noticed by other colonies and over succeeding years, they repeated the same 10 experiment. In May, 1703, South Carolina engaged in this same expedient. Thereafter, New Hampshire followed in 1709, 11 Connecticut in June, 1709, New York in November, 1709, Rhode Island in July, 1710, Pennsylvania in March, 1723, and 12 Maryland in 1733 . The remainder of the colonies, particularly Virginia, seems to have escaped the urge of the dreadful 13 expedient of paper money. 11 George Bancroft noted that the colonies, once addicted to use of paper money, continued with 14 further emissions which only pro ved to be disastrous. 15 During the period when many of the colonies were emitting a paper currency, the value of the notes of one colony 16 constantly fluctuated against the value of all other colonial notes. This uncertainty in value was directly proportional to the 17 number and amount of the emissions made by any particular colony; the results were certain and caused the destruction of 18 trade and commerce as well as confidence in the medium of exchange. This was aptly demonstrated by the example of 19 Rhode Island. In 1743, Rhode Island issued \"bills of credit\" wherein 27 shillings in paper denomination were alleged to 20 equal one ounce of silver. But in 1751, the Rhode Island General Assembly devalued these bills to the point where, at law, 21 54 shillings in paper were exchangeable for one ounce of silver. Undeterred by the ill effects of devaluation, the Assembly 22 thereafter made the exchange rate equal 64 shillings of paper for an ounce of silver. Not only did the colonies violate the 23 express dictates of Oresme and the common law by making paper be money and not gold and silver, but they further 24 violated the law against debasement and debased their paper. 25 In 1751, one of our founding fathers, Roger Sherman, the very man who made Article 1, § 10, cl. 1 a prominent part of our 26 Constitution, was engaged in business in Connecticut. While so employed, he extended credit to a merchant from Rhode 27 Island, who later attempted to discharge his liability to Sherman with Rhode Island paper money. Sherman refused, and a 28 legal contro versy thereafter ensued. While Roger Sherman plead in this suit that the law required specie payment, the 29 Rhode Island merchant defended himself on the basis of custom of the people. The decision in the case was in favor of the 30 Rhode Island merchant. 31 Sher man was incensed at the verdict and decided, in the great tradition of Oresme, Cotton, Locke and Blackstone, to 32 espouse his views in book form. In 1752, Sherman wrote a short treatise entitled A Caveat Against Injustice, or An Inquiry 33 Into the Evil Consequences of a Fluctuating Medium of Exchange . This treatise of Roger Sherman, in addition to its value 34 in noting the injustice and inequity of a fluctuating medium of exchange, is of immense value in determining the true intent 35 and meaning of Art. 1, § 10. He demonstrated that the viability of commerce was dependent upon traders and businessmen 36 exchanging their goods and commodities for currency of intrinsic value. Such businessmen had surrendered property of 37 specific value in order to accumulate the commodities they were selling. At the time of sale, the contract price of the goods 38 sold included the cost of such goods as well as a return for the labors of the businessman. If the currency utilized to effect 39 this commercial exchange was without intrinsic value, or its intrinsic value was being deflated by actions of a sovereign 40 government, the businessman was being unfairly and unjustly deprived of his property and labor. S herman concluded: 41 \"But if what is us'd as a Medium of Exchange is fluctuating in its Value it is no better than unjust Weights and 42 Measures, both which are condemn'd by the Laws of GOD and Man, and therefore the longest and most 43 universal Custom could never make the Use of such a Medium either lawful or reasonable. 44 \"And instead of having our Properties defended and secured to us by the Protection of the Government under 45 which we live; we should be always exposed to have them taken from us by Fraud at the Pleasure of our 46 Government, who have no Right of Jurisdiction over us. 47   11 See George Bancroft's excellent treatment in A Plea for the Constitution, Wounded in the House of Its Guardians."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":" The Money Scam 48 of 120 Copyright Sovereignty Education and Defense Ministry, http://sedm.org Form 05.041, Rev. 10- 18- 200 9 EXHIBIT:________ \"But so long as we part with our most valuable Commodities for such Bills of credit as are no Profit; but rather 1 a Cheat, Vexation and Snare to us, and become a Medium whereby we are c ontinually cheating and wronging 2 one another in our Dealings and Commerce * * * we shall spend a great Part of our labour and Substance for 3 that which will not profit us.\" 12 4 While Roger Sherman had concisely stated the reasons and need for a stable currenc y of specie, he was denied the 5 opportunity to remedy this vicious problem until he attended the Constitutional Convention in 1787. 6 In 1755, war with France, who was attempting to settle the basin of the Mississippi River, commenced in the colonies. To 7 aid the war effort and to acquire the necessary resources for it, the colonies used the expedient of paper money. The 8 cessation of this conflict came in 1763, but thereafter the paper money dread continued and the \"need\" for paper money was 9 exacerbated with t he advent of the Revolutionary War. 10 In varying degrees prior to the Revolutionary War, the colonies attempted to redress the problems caused by paper money. 11 Massachusetts declared that lawful money was only gold and silver. Others, however, either ceased emissions or reduced 12 their total amount; see Bancroft's Plea . But by 1775, relations with England had become so hostile that this impending 13 conflict caused the colonies, in a compulsion of monetary insanity, to reach for the old expedient, more paper money . 14 7.3 The Period of the Revolution and the Articles of Confederation 15 With the advent of the Revolutionary War, the colonial governments as well as the Continental Congress sought the 16 services of a bandit commonly referred to as paper money. Be it in times of war or peace, the tool of paper money allows 17 any entity, either government or a private group or consortium, to obtain real resources or wealth of extraordinary value for 18 the mere cost of printing paper. With the services of paper money willingly enlisted by the Revolutionary governments, 19 these governments exchanged their bills of credit, which promised redemption in specie at some future date, for war 20 materiel, supplies and men. But as time passed and the paper emissions became greater, it became apparent that these 21 governments could not possibly honor the promise to redeem these notes for value. 22 During the War, all of the colonies emitted bills of credit, and most declared the same to be a legal tender, the States 23 claiming unto themselves the right to dec lare any thing, especially paper, a legal tender. As the Continental Congress did 24 not possess the power to declare a legal tender, it was compelled to enlist the aid of the sovereign States, which thereafter 25 declared the Continental Notes, along with their own notes, a legal tender for debts. 13 As time and the war passed, more 26 and more paper notes were put into circulation and the constant increase in this quantity caused the decline in value of all 27 outstanding notes. This process is commonly referred to as \"inflation.\" 28 Christopher Collier's book, Roger Sherman's Connecticut , ably recounts the general inflation of this period and the specific 29 monetary difficulties caused to Sherman by these paper emissions: 30 \"One hundred dollars printed in September of 1777 was worth only twenty four a year later and but four in 31 1779. By March 1780 it took $3732 to buy what could have been bought for $100 in late 1777. Sherman had 32 run up a bill of $99 at the barber's; he owed for eight bottles of wine at $58 each and two bar rels of 'cyder' at 33 $100 apiece; 'washing for self and servant $639; for 15 weeks 4 days board self and waiter, $8330; 1 pair silk 34 hose, $300; mending watch, $210; 1 pair leather breeches, $420.'\" 35 Not only did Sherman suffer the extraordinary ravages of inf lation, he had an extremely hard time obtaining payment from 36 the government of Connecticut as its representative to the Continental Congress. This lack of payment occurred 37 notwithstanding the constant paper emissions of Connecticut. 38 Other accounts of infl ation during this War disclosed that in January, 1781, it took $100 in paper to acquire one dollar in 39 specie coin. But by May of the same year, the exchange rate exceeded 500 to 1, and later all paper currency became entirely 40 worthless, hence the phrase \"n ot worth a Continental.\" It is almost certain that the members of the Continental Congress, 41 many of whom attended the Convention of 1787, were as wise and intelligent as any subsequent Congress of the United 42 States, but these gentlemen were unable to make any laws which would effectively repeal the operation of natural economic 43   12 Further discussions of the disastrous and ruinous effects of bills of credit can be found in C raig v. Missouri, supra, and Townsend v. Townsend, 7 Tenn. 1 (1821), among many others. 13 See Vieira's Pieces of Eight."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":" The Money Scam 49 of 120 Copyright Sovereignty Education and Defense Ministry, http://sedm.org Form 05.041, Rev. 10- 18- 200 9 EXHIBIT:________ laws, particularly Gresham's. When the Revolutionary War ended, the state and national governments had obtained all the 1 resources necessary for the War merely by tendering paper. The real cost of the War, in terms of wealth, was borne by those 2 who were forced to part with their property for paper which eventually became worthless. It was through the tool of a paper 3 money that the governments of the Revolutionary War obtained all resou rces for the War without surrendering 4 corresponding value in exchange. The people who lost their wealth and property as a result of being forced to part with 5 their property did not receive fair compensation. 6 Paper money was not only the instrument of thef t, its vicious nature permeated the whole of society. In 1789, Peletiah 7 Webster aptly described the entire social damage resulting from the experiments in paper money: 8 \"Paper money polluted the equity of our laws, turned them into engines of oppression, corrupted the justice of 9 our public administration, destroyed the fortunes of thousands who had confidence in it, enervated the trade, 10 husbandry and manufactures of our country, and went far to destroy the morality of our people.\" 11 Between the end of the War and the time of the Philadelphia Convention of 1787, our young nation suffered economic 12 distress as a result of continuing paper emissions. However, the Congress under the Articles of Confederation did attempt to 13 render some order out of chaos. In common circulation in our country at that time was the Spanish Milled Silver Dollar, 14 and due to its universal use, accounts were kept in this \"dollar\" unit. On July 6, 1785, Congress declared that the money 15 unit of the United States was a \"dollar;\" see 29 Journals of the Continental Congress 499 . On April 8, 1786 , Congress went 16 further and declared: 17 \"Congress by their Act of the 6th July last resolved, that the Money Unit of the United States should be a 18 Dollar, but did not determine what number of grains of Fine Silver should constitute the Dollar. 19 \"We have concluded that Congress by their Act aforesaid, intended the common Dollars that are Current in the 20 United States, and we have made our calculations accordingly * * * 21 \"The Money Unit or Dollar will contain three hundred and seventy five and sixty four hundredths of a Grain of 22 fine Silver. A Dollar containing this number of Grains of fine Silver, will be worth as much as the New Spanish 23 Dollars.\" 14 24 Thus, prior to the Convention of 1787, Congress had made a factual determination that the common money or currency in 25 use by the people of our country was the Spanish Milled Silver Dollar, and further that experiments, tests and analyses of 26 these coins revealed that they contained 375.64 grains of pure silver. Many members of Congress were also delegates to the 27 Philade lphia Constitutional Convention of 1787 and it was based upon the factual findings made by Congress previously 28 that the word \"dollar\" as mentioned in the Constitution had meaning. 29 7.4 The Constitutional Convention of 1787 30 In May, 1787, pursuant to a Congressi onal plan to revise and amend the Articles of Confederation, delegates from the 31 various states met in Philadelphia. The union of the States created by the Articles had been imperfect and therefore a better 32 organization of unity among them was needed. Howev er, a substantial problem confronting all the States at that time was 33 economic and was caused by the monetary system, therefore it was essential that the best monetary system possible also 34 result from the work of the Convention. 35 The best source of informa tion available concerning the secret debates of the Convention is James Madison's notes . Insofar 36 as the monetary provisions of the Constitution are concerned, Madison's notes reveal that on Thursday, August 16, 1787 , 37 the Convention was discussing the proposed Constitution's provisions contained in Article 1, § 8, wherein Congress was to 38 be given the power to \"emit bills on the credit of the United States.\" G ouverneur Morris on this date moved to strike this 39 proposed phrase from the Constitution. In response, Mr. Elseworth stated that he \"thought this a favorable moment to shut 40 and bar the door against paper money.\" He further stated, \"the mischiefs of the var ious experiments which had been made 41 were now fresh in the public mind and had excited the disgust of all the respectable part of America. By withholding the 42 power from the new government, more friends of influence would be gained to it than by almost anyt hing else. Paper 43 money can in no case be necessary. Give the government credit, and other resources will offer. The power may do harm, 44 never good.\" Mr. Wilson commented that, \"it will have a most salutary influence on the credit of the United States to 45   14 30 Journals of the Continental Congress 162 ."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":" The Money Scam 50 of 120 Copyright Sovereignty Education and Defense Ministry, http://sedm.org Form 05.041, Rev. 10- 18- 200 9 EXHIBIT:________ rem ove the possibility of paper money.\" Mr. Read noted that he \"thought the words, if not struck out, would be as alarming 1 as the mark of the Beast in Revelations.\" Even more emphatically voiced was Mr. Langdon's remark that he \"would rather 2 reject the whole plan than retain the three words, 'and emit bills'.\" The motion to strike these words from the Constitution 3 carried by a vote of nine states in favor and two opposed. 4 On Tuesday, August 28, 1787 , the Conv ention was discussing the provisions contained in Article 1, § 10 of the 5 Constitution. Mr. Roger Sherman and Mr. Wilson moved to amend the proposed Article 1, § 10 to include the words \"nor 6 emit bills of credit, nor make anything but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts.\" The discussion concerning 7 this proposed amendment concerned only the portion regarding \"emit bills of credit.\" In support of his motion, Mr. 8 Sherman stated that he \"thought this a favorable crisis for crushing paper money,\" re asoning that \"if the consent of the 9 Legislature could authorize emissions of it, the friends of paper money would make every exertion to get into the 10 Legislature in order to license it.\" The voting concerning the power to emit bills of credit was eight sta tes in favor and two 11 opposed. The remainder of the proposed amendment concerning gold and silver coin passed with no opposition. 12 The work of the Convention was completed on September 17, 1787, and the end result was the Constitution of the United 13 States o f America. In reference to the much needed revision of the monetary system, Congress had been granted the power 14 to \"coin money and regulate the value thereof,\" virtually the identical powers in reference to the currency which it 15 possessed under the Article s, which did not include the power to declare a legal tender. Further, certain binding, absolute 16 and uncircumventable prohibitions had been placed upon the States in Article 1, § 10, cl. 1, one of which limited the legal 17 tender power of the States to gold and silver coin. The chief architect of the monetary powers and disabilities contained in 18 the U.S. Constitution was none other than Roger Sherman, who had so ably expressed his opinion of paper money 35 years 19 earlier and resoundingly condemned it. At the convention, virtually all the delegates held views identical with Sherman, and 20 they were certain that paper money had been permanently prohibited by the \"Supreme Law of the Land.\" The intent of the 21 drafters of the Constitution was to grant to Congress the power to coin gold and silver which could be the only legal tender 22 pursuant to Article 1, § 10. Thus the Constitution was deliberately designed to insure gold and silver coin as the \"money o f 23 the realm.\" 24 The proposed Constitution was thereafter submitted to the states for ratification. In Maryland, a delegate to the Convention, 25 a lawyer named Luther Martin who was probably one of the few men to oppose prohibitions upon paper currency, 26 summar ized the work of the Convention: 27 \"By our original articles of confederation, the Congress have a power to borrow money and emit bills of credit, 28 on the credit of the United States; agreeably to which, was the report on this system as made by the committee 29 of detail. When we came to this part of the report, a motion was made to strike out the words 'to emit bills of 30 credit.' Against the motion we urged, that it would be improper to deprive the Congress of that power. But, Sir, 31 a majority of the convention, being wise beyond every event, and being willing to risk any political evil, rather 32 than admit the idea of a paper emission, in any possible event, refused to trust this authority to a government, to 33 which they were lavishing the most unlimited powers of taxation, and they erased that clause from the system. 34 \"By the tenth section every State is prohibited from emitting bills of credit. As it was reported by the committee 35 of detail, the States were only prohibited from emitting them without the consent of C ongress; but the 36 convention was so smitten with the paper money dread, that they insisted the prohibition should be absolute. It 37 was my opinion, Sir, that the States ought not to be totally deprived of the right to emit bills of credit, and that, 38 as we had not given an authority to the general government for that purpose, it was the more necessary to 39 retain it in the States. I therefore thought it my duty to vote against this part of the system.\" 40 Thus, it is clear from both the proponents of the constitutio nal ban upon paper money and one of its most ardent foes that 41 the clear design of the Constitution in reference to monetary powers was an absolute prohibition upon any paper money. 42 In New York, debate concerning ratification of the Constitution was heated. There, Alexander Hamilton, James Madison 43 and John Jay came to the defense of the proposed Constitution by publication of a series of articles concerning the 44 Constitution in New York newspapers. This series, now known as the Federalist Papers , contains virtually the best source 45 of information concerning the interpretation of our Constitution. In Article number 44 , written by Madison, the following 46 comments were made regarding the intent of Article 1, § 10: 47 \"The extension of the prohibition to bills of credit must give pleasure to every citizen in proportion to his love of 48 justice and his knowledge of the true springs of public prosperity. The loss which America has sustained since 49 the peace, from the pestilent effects of paper money on the necessary confidence between man and man, on the 50 industry and morals of the people, and on the character of republican government, constitutes an enormous 51"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":" The Money Scam 51 of 120 Copyright Sovereignty Education and Defense Ministry, http://sedm.org Form 05.041, Rev. 10- 18- 200 9 EXHIBIT:________ debt against the States chargeable with this unadvised measure which must long remain unsatisfied, or rather 1 an accumulation of guilt which can be expiated no otherwise than by a voluntary sacrifice on the alter of justice 2 of the power which has been the instrument of it. In addition to these persuasive considerations, it may be 3 observed that the same reasons which show the necessity of denying to the States the power of regulating coin 4 prove with equal force that they ought not to be at liberty to substitute a paper medium in the place of coin. Had 5 every State a right to regulate the value of its coin, there must be as many different cur rencies as States, and 6 thus the intercourse among them would be impeded; retrospective alterations in its value might be made, and 7 thus citizens of other States be injured, and animosities be kindled among the States themselves. The subjects of 8 foreign pow ers might suffer from the same cause, and hence the Union be discredited and embroiled by the 9 indiscretion of a single member. No one of these mischiefs is less incident to a power in the States to emit paper 10 money than to coin gold or silver. The power to make anything but gold and silver a tender in payment of debts 11 is withdrawn from the States on the same principle with that of issuing a paper currency.\" 12 The success of the Federalist was evident in the fact that the proponents of the Constitution were su ccessful in securing 13 ratification in New York. 14 The adoption of the U.S. Constitution in 1789 paved the way for the intended \"more perfect union.\" An analysis of the 15 method of construction of the constitutional provisions in reference to the currency power s thereof and of the 16 contemporaneous expressions of these provisions leads to the unmistakable conclusion that the Constitution designed a 17 monetary system based upon gold and silver coin, and the standard so built was enduring, perfect and immutable. The 18 influence of Oresme, Cotton, Locke and Blackstone is easily perceived. 19 7.5 Period I: The Civil War 20 After the adoption of the U.S. Constitution, establishment of the three great departments thereof and the construction of a 21 political order in harmony with that great document, Congress embarked upon the task of providing monetary order to the 22 affairs of the young nation. One of the first monetary tasks undertaken by the new Congress was obtaining from Alexander 23 Hamilton his \" Report on the Subject of a Mint .\" 15 Therein, Hamilton relied upon the previously mentioned Congressional 24 resolutions of 1785 and 1786, and determined as a matter of fact that the Spanish Milled Silver Dollar was by accepted 25 custom the monetary unit of the United States. Hamilton proffered the suggestion that such a \"dollar\" was in fact equal to 26 371.25 grains of pure silver and he suggested an exchange ratio, established by the market, between gold and silver as 1 to 27 15. Based upon Hamilton's Report, Congress adopted \"The Coinage Act of 1792,\" 1 Stat. 246 , which found that a \"dollar\" 28 was equal to 371.25 grains of pure silver. This Act of Congress, therefore, immutably set the value of a \"dollar\" at 371.25 29 grains of pure silver, and Congress, in accordance with the principles of Oresme, Cotton, Locke and Blackstone, lacked all 30 power to ever debase this standard. 31 The generation of men who drafted th e U.S. Constitution and the generation immediately following were acutely aware of 32 the precise monetary powers and disabilities embodied in our national charter. The men who sat in the state courts and the 33 United States Supreme Court up to the outbreak of the Civil War demonstrated these principles in the decisions they wrote. 34 Insofar as the U.S. Supreme Court is concerned, these principles can be found by examining certain of the opinions 35 rendered during this period, among which include the following: 36 Cal der v. Bull , 3 U.S. (3 Dall.) 386, 390 (1798) : 37 \"The prohibitions not to make anything but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of de bts, and not to pass 38 any law impairing the obligations of contracts, were inserted to secure private rights.\" 39 Sturges v. Crowninshield , 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 12 2 (1819) : 40 \"It was notorious that the States had emitted paper money, and made it a tender; had compelled creditors to 41 receive payment of debts due to them in various articles of property of inadequate value; had allowed debts to 42 be paid by installments, and prohibited a recovery of the interest. All these evils, so destructive of public and 43 private faith, and so embarrassing to commerce, the convention intended, doubtless, to prevent in future. The 44 language employed speaks only of paper money and tender laws, by a particular description,\" 4 Wheat. at 133. 45 \"That the prevailing evil of the times, which produced this clause in t he constitution, was the practice of 46 emitting paper money, of making property which was useless to the creditor a discharge of his debt, and of 47   15 2 Debates and Proceedings in the Congress of the United States, Appendix at 2059."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":" The Money Scam 52 of 120 Copyright Sovereignty Education and Defense Ministry, http://sedm.org Form 05.041, Rev. 10- 18- 200 9 EXHIBIT:________ changing the time of payment by authorizing distant installments. Laws of this description, not insolvent laws, 1 constituted, it is said, the mischief to be remedied,\" 4 Wheat. at 199. 2 \"We are told they were such as grew out of the general distress following the war in which our independence 3 was established. To relieve this distress, paper money was issued, worthles s lands and other property of no use 4 to the creditor were made a tender in payment of debts; and the time of payment, stipulated in the contract, was 5 extended by law. These were the peculiar evils of the day. So much mischief was done, and so much more was 6 apprehended, that general distrust prevailed, and all confidence between man and man was destroyed. 7 \"Was the general prohibition intended to prevent paper money? We are not allowed to say so because it is 8 expressly provided that no states shall 'emit bills of credit;' neither could these words be intended to restrain the 9 states from enabling debtors to discharge their debts by the tender of property of no real value to the creditor 10 because for that subject also particular provision is made. Nothing but gold and silver coin can be made a 11 tender in payment of debts,\" 4 Wheat. at 204. 12 Ogden v. Saunders , 25 U.S. (12 Wheat.) 213 (1827) : 13 \"It declares that 'no state shall coin money, emit bills of credit, make anything but gold and silver coin a tender 14 in payment of debts.' These prohibitions, ass ociated with the powers granted to Congress 'to coin money, and to 15 regulate the value thereof, and of foreign coin' most obviously constitute members of the same family, being 16 upon the same subject and governed by the same policy. 17 \"This policy was to provide a fixed and uniform standard of value throughout the United States, by which the 18 commercial and other dealings between the citizens thereof, or between them and foreigners, as well as the 19 monied transactions of the government, should be regulated. For it might well be asked, why vest in Congress 20 the power to establish a uniform standard of value by the means pointed out, if the states might use the same 21 means, and thus defeat the uniformity of the standard and, consequently, the standard itself? And why establish 22 a standard at all, for the government of the various contracts which might be entered into, if those contracts 23 might afterwards be discharged by a different standard, or by that which is not money, under the authority of 24 tender laws,\" 12 Wheat. at 265. 25 \"The prohibition in the constitution to make anything but gold or silver coin a tender in payment of debts is 26 express and universal. The framers of the constitution regarded it as an evil to be repelled without modification; 27 they have, therefore, left nothing to be inferred or deduced from construction on this subject,\" 12 Wheat. at 288. 28 \"The next in order is, or 'make anything but gold and silver a tender in payment of debts;' this is founded upon 29 the same principles of public and national policy as the prohibition to coin money and emit bills of credit, and 30 is so considered in the commentary on this clause in the number of the Federalist I have referred to. It is there 31 said, the power to make anything but gold and silver a tender in payment of de bts, is withdrawn from the states, 32 on the same principles with that of issuing a paper currency. All these prohibitions, therefore, relate to powers 33 of a public nature, and are general and universal in their application and inseparably connected with national 34 policy,\" 12 Wheat. at 306. 35 \"The prohibition is not, that no state shall pass any law, but that even if a law does exist, the 'state shall not 36 make anything but gold and silver coin a legal tender.' The language plainly imports that the prohibited tend er 37 shall not be made a legal tender, whether a law of the state exists or not. The whole subject of tender, except in 38 gold and silver, is withdrawn from the states,\" 12 Wheat. at 328. 39 \"The second class of prohibited laws comprehends those whose operation consists in their action on 40 individuals. These are laws which make anything but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts, * * * 41 \"In all these cases, whether the thing prohibited be the exercise of mere political power, or legislative action on 42 individuals, the prohibition is complete and total. There is no exception from it. Legislation of every description 43 is comprehended within it,\" 12 Wheat. at 335. 44 Craig v. Missouri , 29 U.S. (4 Peters) 410 (1830) : 45 \"At a very early period of our colonial history the attempt to supply the want of the precious metals by a paper 46 medium was made to a considerable extent, and the bills emitted for this purpose have been frequently 47 denominated bills of credit. During the war of our revolution we were driven to this expedient, and necessity 48 compelled us to use it to a most fearful extent. The term has acquired an appropriate meaning; and 'bills of 49 credit' signify a paper medium, intended to circulate between individuals and between government and 50 individuals, for the ordinary purposes of society. Such a me dium has been always liable to considerable 51 fluctuation. Its value is continually changing; and these changes, often great and sudden, expose individuals to 52 immense loss, are the sources of ruinous speculations, and destroy all confidence between man and man. To cut 53 up this mischief by the roots, a mischief which was felt through the United States, and which deeply affected the 54 interest and prosperity of all, the people declared in their Constitution that no State should emit bills of credit. 55"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":" The Money Scam 53 of 120 Copyright Sovereignty Education and Defense Ministry, http://sedm.org Form 05.041, Rev. 10- 18- 200 9 EXHIBIT:________ If the prohibi tion means anything, if the words are not empty sounds, it must comprehend the emission of any 1 paper medium by a State government for the purpose of commons circulation,\" 4 Peters, at 431 -32. 2 \"The Constitution, therefore, considers the emission of bills o f credit and enactment of tender laws as distinct 3 operations, independent of each other which may be separately performed. Both are forbidden,\" 4 Peters, at 4 434. 5 \"Congress emitted bills of credit to a large amount and did not, perhaps could not, make them a legal tender. 6 This power resided in the States,\" 4 Peters, at 435. 7 Dissenting opinion of J. Johnson: 8 \"The great end and object of this restriction on the power of the States, will furnish the best definition of the 9 terms under the consideration. The w hole was intended to exclude everything from use as a circulating medium 10 except gold and silver, and to give to the United States the exclusive control over the coining and valuing of the 11 metallic medium.

Bank of the Commonwealth of Kentucky , 36 U.S. (11 Peters) 257 (1837) : 13 \"If the Legislature of a State attempt to make the notes of any bank a tender, the act will be unconstitutio nal * * 14 *, \" 11 Peters, at 316. 15 \"They acted upon known facts and not theories, and meant, by prohibiting the States from emitting bills of 16 credit, to prohibit any issue in any form, to pass as paper currency or paper money, whose basis was the credit, 17 or funds or debts, or promises of the states * * * They knew that whatever paper currency is not directly and 18 immediately, at the mere will of the holder, redeemable in gold and silver, is, and forever must be liable to 19 constant depreciation,\" 11 Peters, at 3 39. 20 United States v. Marigold , 50 U.S. (9 How.) 560, 567 -68 (1850) : 21 \"They appertain rather to the execution of an important trust invested by the Constitution, and to the obligation 22 to fulfill that trust on the part of the government, namely, the trust and the duty of creating and maintaining a 23 uniform and pure metallic standard of value throughout the Union. The power of coining money and of 24 regulating its value was delegated to Congress by the Constitution for the very purpose, as assigned by the 25 framers of that instrument, of creating and preserving the uniformity and purity of such standard of value * * * 26 \"If the medium which the government was authorized to create and establish could immediately be expelled, 27 and substituted by one it had neither created, estima ted, nor authorized one possessing no intrinsic value then 28 the power conferred by the Constitution would be useless wholly fruitless of every end it was designed to 29 accomplish. Whatever functions Congress are, by the Constitution, authorized to pe rform, they are, when the 30 public good requires it, bound to perform; and on this principle, having emitted a circulating medium, a 31 standard of value indispensable for the purposes of the community, and for the action of the government itself, 32 they are acco rdingly authorized and bound in duty to prevent its debasement and expulsion, and the destruction 33 of the general confidence and convenience, by the influx and substitution of a spurious coin in lieu of the 34 constitutional currency.\" 35 Thus, from diverse prono uncements and opinions of the United States Supreme Court, a steady allegiance to the original 36 and true intent of our founding fathers in reference to the monetary provisions of the U.S. Constitution can be discerned. In 37 none of these various decisions is there any reference or allusion to any power of the States to enforce a tender in anything 38 but gold and silver coin; further, there was no mention of any power in the federal government to permit, sanction or even 39 compel the States to violate the constrain t of Article 1, § 10, cl. 1 as such was an absolute and mandatory provision. 40 Further, it was considered heresy to intimate any power in the federal government to issue any paper money. The adherence 41 of the Supreme Court to the intent of the framers must surely have had a beneficial effect upon our nation. 42 Not only was the Supreme Court a guardian of the true intent of the framers during this period of time, the high courts of 43 the various States of our Union were also as we ll. During the time prior to the Civil War, these state courts rendered 44 opinions in many cases regarding the monetary provisions of the U.S. Constitution and all these decisions had one common 45 theme: nothing but gold and silver coin could be a tender in pa yment of debts. Notwithstanding the imaginative schemes of 46 men and governments calculated to find a way to circumvent Article 1, § 10, these state courts held fast and maintained 47 their allegiance to the Constitution.

McGhee and McDermott , 16 Tenn. 242 (1835) : 14 \"By the Constitution of the United States nothing can be a tender in payment of debt but gold and silver coin,\" 15 16 Tenn., at 244. 16 \"The answer to this argument is that the Constitution of the United States is the supreme law, and that no law 17 can be valid which, in violation of that instrument, shall attempt to make anything but gold and silver coin a 18 tender,\" 16 Tenn., at 245. 19 \"The constitution of the United States (art. 1, sec. 10) prohibits any state making 'anything but gold and silver 20 coin a tender in payment of debts;\" 16 Tenn., at 246. 21 \"This provision was inserted to prevent the existence of a spurious and worthless currency, and is of positive 22 and paramount obligation,\" 16 Tenn., at 246- 47. 23 7.5.11 Texas : 24 Ogden v. Slade , 1 Tex. 13, 14 (1846) : 25 \"The note calls for four hundred dollars, lawful funds of the United States. What is the plain meaning of 'lawful 26 funds?' Gold and silver is the only lawful tender in the United States. It must therefore mean payment in gold or 27 silver. By equivalent, the parties must have meant such paper currency as passed at par with gold and silver.\" 28 7.5.12 Vermont : 29 Wainright v. Webster , 11 Ver. 576 (1839) : 30 \"No state is authorized to coin money, or pass any law whereby anything but gold and silver shall be made a 31 legal tender in payment of debt. * * * This conventional understanding that bank bills are to pass as money is 32 founded upon the solvency of the bank and upon the supposition that the bills are equivalent in value to specie 33 and are, at any time, convertible into specie at the option of the holder. Upon no other ground do bank bills, by 34 common consent, pass as money,\" 11 Ver., at 580. 35 \"When, therefore, a bank stops payment, the bills thereof cease, by this conventional arrangement, to be the 36 representative of money,\" 11 Ver., at 581. 37 Thus, from a reading of decisions rendered by state courts and the U.S. Supreme Court, Article 1, § 10, cl. 1 of the U.S. 38 Constitution had a fixed and determined meaning. This understanding was not limited to the courts of our nation, and it was 39 clearly understood by both Congress and the Presidents of our nation. For example, during the debate on the question of 40 whether to renew the charter of the Second Bank of the United States (3 Stat. 266) in 1836, Senator Daniel Webster 41 observed regarding the monetary provisions of the Constitution: 42 \"Currency, in a large and perhaps just sense, incl udes not only gold and silver and bank bills, but bills of 43 exchange also. It may include all that adjusts exchanges and settles balances in the operations of trade and 44 business; but if we understand by currency the legal money of the country, and that which constitutes a legal 45 tender for debts, and is the standard measure of value, then undoubtedly nothing is included but gold and silver. 46 Most unquestionably there is no legal tender, and there can be no legal tender in this country, under the 47 authority of this government or any other, but gold and silver, either the coinage of our own mints or foreign 48 coins at rates regulated by Congress. This is a constitutional principle, perfectly plain and of the highest 49 importance. The States are expressly prohibited fr om making anything but gold and silver a legal tender in 50 payment of debts, and although no such express prohibition is applied to Congress, yet, as Congress has no 51"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":" The Money Scam 58 of 120 Copyright Sovereignty Education and Defense Ministry, http://sedm.org Form 05.041, Rev. 10- 18- 200 9 EXHIBIT:________ power granted to it in this respect but to coin money and to regulate the value of foreign coins, it clearly has no 1 power to substitute paper or anything else for coin as a tender in payment of debts and in discharge of 2 contracts. Congress has exercised this power fully in both its branches; it has coined money, and still coins it; it 3 has regulat ed the value of foreign coins, and still regulates their value. The legal tender, therefore, the 4 constitutional standard of value, is established and can not be overthrown. To overthrow it would shake the 5 whole system,\" 4 Webster's Works , 271. 6 Further, on December 5, 1836, President Jackson stated in his 8th Annual Address to Congress: 7 \"It is apparent from the whole context of the Constitution, as well as the history of the times which gave birth to 8 it, that it was the purpose of the Convention to establish a currency consisting of the precious metals. These, 9 from their peculiar properties which rendered them the standard of value in all other countries, were adopted in 10 this as well to estab lish its commercial standard in reference to foreign countries by a permanent rule as to 11 exclude the use of a mutable medium of exchange, such as of certain agricultural commodities recognized by 12 the statutes of some states as a tender for debts, or the still more pernicious expedient of a paper currency.\" 13 Beyond the scope of this necessarily brief treatment of the monetary provisions of the U.S. Constitution is any 14 consideration of the development of banking in our country during this period. Excellent ref erences for this separate topic 15 are A Short History of Paper Money and Banking , written by William Gouge in 1833 , and Dr. Ron Paul's and Lewis 16 Lehrman's work entitled The Case for Gold . These sources disclose the evils caused to our young nation by private banking 17 establishments, which were as injurious as the paper money issued by colonial governments. Notwithstanding the adverse 18 consequences caused by private note issuance by banks, which then caused and now continue to cause financial ruin for 19 Americans, the clear and unmistakable voice of government of this period, be it from the courts, the legislative or executive 20 branches, held gold and silver coin as the only money, pursuant to the express commands of the Constitution. 21 7.6 Period II: A Different Day. From the Civil War to 1933 22 With the advent of the Civil War in 1861, the alluring call of the \"Sirens\" beckoning further experiments with that 23 expedient thief, paper money, was heard by both governments north and south of the Mason Dixon line. For real and 24 imag ined reasons, the southern States departed the Union, established the Confederacy and fired upon Fort Sumter. No 25 sooner had the Confederate Flag been flown from Montgomery than that illfated rebellious government reached for the ever 26 ready tool of wealth expropriation, paper money. It was through the services of paper money that the Confederacy obtained 27 everything necessary for war without surrendering anything of comparable value in exchange. 28 Insofar as the Union was concerned, it quickly learned that ta xation and borrowing to meet war expenses would be 29 extremely unpolitical. But, there apparently were some extremely perceptive minds in Washington which perceived the real 30 lessons of the Revolutionary War. The Continental Notes of the Revolutionary War would not have become worthless if 31 there had been an appropriate mechanism for taxing the notes out of circulation for the purpose of maintaining their value. 32 Realizing the importance of this principle, Congress enacted such a vehicle in July, 1861, and passe d the first national 33 income tax act. Once this legislation was in place, the Union, following the lead of the Confederacy, succumbed to the 34 paper money call in early 1862. 35 Treasury Secretary Chase, later to become Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, began the call for paper money to meet 36 the exigent expenses of war. In Congress, the debate concerning this proposal was extremely heated. 16 Some Congressmen 37 condemned the act to make Treasury notes a legal tender as unconstitutional while others argued in its favor. In the end, 38 Congress, obviously as an act of desperation and expedience, passed the Legal Tender Act of 1862, 12 Stat. 345 . With the 39 passage of this act, Congress ignored both the lessons of history and the plain intent of the framers of the U.S. Constitutio n. 40 In the interim of 8 years from the pas sage of the first of the series of legal tender acts until the Supreme Court was finally 41 called upon to address this issue, the state courts of our nation were presented with the horns of a dilemma. Nowhere in any 42 judicial decision of the past, or even in any uttering from Congress or the Executive, was there the slightest indication of 43 such a Congressional power to declare paper Treasury notes a legal tender. Allegiance to the intent of the law as expounded 44 by the framers required a holding that the acts w ere unconstitutional; however, doing such would surely damage the cause 45 of the Union and its war effort. 46   16 See Vieira's Pieces of Eight."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":" The Money Scam 59 of 120 Copyright Sovereignty Education and Defense Ministry, http://sedm.org Form 05.041, Rev. 10- 18- 200 9 EXHIBIT:________ An example of this problem faced by the state courts is clearly seen in the decisions of the Indiana Supreme Court. In 1 Reynolds v. State Bank of India na , 18 Ind. 467 (1862) , the Court held the Legal Tender Act of 1862 constitutional, only 2 after giving every reason to rule agai nst the act. In so holding, that court stated: 3 \"The convention which adopted the constitution not only did not grant, but they expressly rejected it as a 4 substantive power, and for the distinctly declared purpose of preventing its exercise, by Congress, u nder any 5 pretext or circumstances whatever; and this, too, after the power had been once expressly granted to the 6 Federal Government; and the States subsequently ratified the constitution with this understanding,\" 18 Ind., at 7 470- 71. 8 \"Currency, as a mediu m of exchange, is a great necessity of commerce, and it is an acknowledged power of 9 every government to ordain what shall constitute that currency. Governments have done so; and, throughout 10 the civilized world, they have all concurred in declaring that gold and silver shall be that currency. Why they 11 have so declared will be seen as we advance. Now, the precise question of what should be the currency of this 12 nation, what should be its medium of commerce, what should be used to meet that necessity, was the o ne that 13 was before the convention which constructed the frame of our government, and they ordained and established, 14 by the paramount, the fundamental law of the nation, that that currency should be gold and silver, or paper 15 issued upon, and as the representative, of gold and silver, and not bills of credit issued simply upon the 16 indebtedness and faith of the government,\" 18 Ind., at 471- 72. 17 But, within 2 years of the rendition of the opinion in Reynolds , supra, the Indiana Supreme Court had occasion to 18 reco nsider the prior opinion and this time, in Thayer v. Hedges , 22 Ind. 282 (1864) , found the legal tender acts of Congress 19 expressly unconstitutional: 20 \"In another aspect, it enables the government to make, by indirection, forced loans as actual if not as 21 oppressive as those of Charles I, as they are made without interest, against the will of the lender, and without 22 repayment of but a part of the principal; thus, in this case, as an example. The government desires Thayer to 23 loan it 500 dollars. Thayer expresses his inability or unwillingness to spare the money. The government then 24 goes to Hedges and Kleiger and says to them, you owe Thayer 500 dollars, which you are about to pay him. The 25 government wants that money, but he will not loan it. You pay it to the government, and it will give you a piece 26 of paper which it will compel him to take of you, instead of the money contracted for, in payment of your debt,\" 27 22 Ind., at 286- 87. 28 \"That the power to coin money is one power, and the power to declare anything a legal tender is another, and 29 different power; that both were possessed by the States severally at the adoption of the Constitution; that by that 30 adoption, the powe r to coin money was delegated to the Federal Government, while the power to declare a 31 legal tender was not, but was retained by the States with a limitation, thus: 'Congress should have power to 32 coin money' and 'no State shall coin money,' and 'no State shall make anything but gold and silver coin a legal 33 tender.' States, then, though they can not coin money, can declare that gold or silver coin, or both, whether 34 coined by the Federal, or the Spanish or the Mexican Government, shall be legal tender. And as Congress was 35 authorized to make money only out of coin, and the States were forbidden to make anything but coin a legal 36 tender, a specie currency was secured in both the Federal and States governments. There was thus no need of 37 delegating to Congress the p ower of declaring a legal tender in transactions within the domain of Federal 38 legislation. The money coined by it was the necessary medium,\" 22 Ind., at 300 -01. 39 \"Walker, in his Am. Law, p. 145, declares it an act of despotic power to make paper a legal tender. The 40 principal interference of government with the currency has been to debase it. Say gives an account of the acts of 41 the French monarchs, of this character, in his Political Economy, book 1, chap. 21, sec. 5, and adds: 'Let no 42 government imagine tha t, to strip them of the power of defrauding their subjects, is to deprive them of a 43 valuable privilege.' Says Mr. Gouge: 'No instance is on record of a nation's having arrived at great wealth 44 without the use of gold and silver money. Nor is there, on the o ther hand, any instance of a nation's 45 endeavoring to supplant this natural money, without involving itself in distress and embarrassment,'\" 22 Ind., at 46 305. 47 \"It was the intention, by the Federal Constitution, to withhold this power of supplanting natural money from the 48 general government, and to strip the states of it, and thus extinguish it, and insure to the people and nation a 49 sound currency forever. Of this we have not the slightest doubt. Money should be to values, what weights and 50 measures are to quantities, the exact measure, and a uniform, stable one. The States were prohibited from 51 making anything but gold and silver a tender for debts, and the general government was authorized, touching 52 this subject, only 'to coin money, regulate the value thereof, and of foreign coin,' * * * It will be observed that 53 while the States are forbidden to make anything but gold and silver a tender, Congress is empowered to coin 54 money, without being limited to the two kinds of coin to which the States are restricted,\" 22 Ind., at 306. 55 \"Now, the power is no where expressly given to Congress to make even coin a legal tender, but the prohibition 56 to the States to make anything but gold and silver such tender, goes upon the assumption that the power over 57 the subject of legal tender is possessed by the States; * * * and the Constitution restricts them to two articles, 58 either or both of which they may make thus; and the general government has not the power to make anything a 59 legal tender except as an incident to the power to coin,\" 22 Ind., at 307- 08. 60"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":" The Money Scam 60 of 120 Copyright Sovereignty Education and Defense Ministry, http://sedm.org Form 05.041, Rev. 10- 18- 200 9 EXHIBIT:________ Other states found need to construe the Legal Tender Acts in reference to the issue of whether \"greenbacks\" could be used 1 to pay state taxes. In Perry v. Washburn , 20 Cal. 318 (1862) , the California Supreme Court ruled that United States notes 2 could not be used to pay state taxes, especially where a California statute required taxes to be paid in coin. In State 3 Treasurer v. Collector Sang amon County , 28 Ill. 509, 512 (1862) , the Illinois Supreme Court ruled in the same fashion, and 4 reasoned: 5 \"The jurisdiction of the State on the subject of taxation, for all State purposes, is supreme, and over which, the 6 government of the United States can have no power or control. That government acts through delegated power 7 and can exercise no other except such as may be necessary to carry into effect a granted power. The power has 8 been, nowhere, delegated to the Congress to interfere with the mode which a state may adopt to raise a revenue 9 for its own purposes, or the manner or funds in which it shall be collected. This is a subject peculiarly 10 belonging to the States, and wholly under State control, so that should it be deemed by the State expedient to 11 collect its revenue for its own use, in the productions of its own soil, no power on earth could interfere to forbid 12 it.\" 13 A particularly important decision against the constitutionality of the legal tender acts of Congress was Griswold v. 14 Hepburn , 63 Ky. 20 (1865) . Here, the Kentucky Supreme Court was required to decide the constitutionality of the acts and 15 the decision made was that the acts contravened the U.S. Constitution: 16 \"When the Constitution was adopted, as even yet, all foreign money was metallic coin; and therefore the power 17 to regulate such coin was constructively restricted to coined metal, and did not include notes on the Bank of 18 England, or consols, or other government bonds or securities. The conclusion is plain, and apparently 19 inevitable, that the power to coin money was intended to mean to coin metal as the money of the United States; 20 and the curse of the paper currency of the revolution, the fiscal ruin of the confederation, and the history of the 21 adoption of the Federal Constitution, conduce strongly to prove that, when the people who adopted it delegated 22 to Congress exclusive power 'to coin money,' they intended that nothing else than metallic coin should be 23 money, or be a legal tender, in invitum, as money; and it is almost certain that they did not intend to confer on 24 Congress any more or other power to make money, or declare any thing else to be money, or compel the 25 circulation of any thing else as money,\" 63 Ky., at 30. 26 \"The power to coin 'money' is the only moneymaking power delegated to Congress. Without express grant, 27 Congress could have had no power whatever over money. The only grant made is specific and well defined, and 28 beyond this Congress can have no express authority to go; and any attempt to go further would defeat the great 29 purpose of defining and establishing coin as the money of the United States; and, therefore, and also because 30 no such substantive power could be implied, Congress can have no implied power to make any thing else than 31 coin money. Knowing that Congress coul d have no power over money except so far as delegated, the people 32 chose, for national reasons, to delegate the single power 'to coin money,' and there stopped. And anxious to 33 maintain coin as the only money, they tied the hands of their own Legislature, an d not only abandoned all their 34 inherent power over money, except a qualified power over the legal tender, expressly restricted to gold and 35 silver, but, for the same immutable reason, withheld from Congress any power over tender. That renunciation of 36 their absolute power and reservation of a qualified power over tender, is itself, and alone, sufficient proof of a 37 constructive and purposeful denial to Congress of any power over it,\" 63 Ky., at 34. 38 \"And if we are right, as we feel well assured we are, no one can pretend that the power assumed is, or could be, 39 implied, because it is an axiomatic truth, that nothing inconsistent with the Constitution can be implied as 40 constitutional. And had there been no other objection to the assumed implication in this case, it would be 41 repelled by the fact that to make money and fix the law of tender are great substantive powers, recognized and 42 disposed of by the Constitution, and, therefore, no power on that subject can be implied beyond or different 43 from that expressed,\" 63 Ky., at 43. 44 While some state courts found, as above, that the legal tender acts were unconstitutional, other courts in different states 45 upheld them. In Metropolitan Bank v. Van Dyck , 27 N.Y. 400 (1863) , and Shollenberger v. Brinton , 52 Pa. St. 9 (1866) , the 46 Supreme Courts of N ew York and Pennsylvania upheld their constitutionality. Thus, the war torn nation was divided not 47 only physically, but also judicially insofar as the lawfulness of the Congressional legislation regarding legal tender 48 Treasury notes was concerned. 49 Of rela ted importance to the issue of legal tender Treasury notes is the issue of the lawfulness of the Confederacy's paper 50 money. At the commencement of the Civil War, the C.S.A. had issued paper money to obtain resources for the war effort, 51 and the emissions of this paper were virtually constant. Payment of these notes was based upon a contingency, the 52 contingency being the ratification of a peace treaty between the C.S.A. and the U.S.A. With the surrender of that great 53 soldier, Gen. Robert E. Lee , the Confederacy ceased to exist. The downfall of the rebellion thus presented to the federal 54 courts the serious problem of how to treat debts contracted before and during the war in the South which debts had be en 55 partially paid with Confederate money. 56"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":" The Money Scam 61 of 120 Copyright Sovereignty Education and Defense Ministry, http://sedm.org Form 05.041, Rev. 10- 18- 200 9 EXHIBIT:________ One of the first cases rendered by the U.S. Supreme Court wherein the confederate currency was an issue was Thoringto n v. 1 Smith , 75 U.S. (8 Wall.) 1 (1869) . Here, the Supreme Court reasoned that the Confederacy was a de facto government 2 imposed by irresis tible force and that, while it existed, citizens of the Confederacy of necessity had to obey its civil 3 authority. Insofar as Confederate notes were concerned, the Court described them as follows: 4 \"As contracts in themselves, except in the contingency of s uccessful revolution, these notes were nullities; for, 5 except in that event, there could be no payer. They bore, indeed, this character upon their face, for they were 6 made payable only 'after the ratification of a treaty of peace between the Confederate St ates and the United 7 States of America.' While the war lasted, however, they had a certain contingent value, and were used as money 8 in nearly all the business transactions of many millions of people. They must be regarded, therefore, as a 9 currency imposed o n the community by irresistable force,\" 8 Wall., at 11. 10 \"Considered in themselves, and in the light of subsequent events, these notes had no real value, but they were 11 made current as dollars by irresistable force. They were the only measure of value which the people had, and 12 their use was a matter of almost absolute necessity. And this use gave them a sort of value, insignificant and 13 precarious enough it is true, but always having a sufficiently definite relation to gold and silver, the universal 14 measure o f value, so that it was always easy to ascertain how much gold and silver was the real equivalent of a 15 sum expressed in this currency,\" 8 Wall., at 13. 16 Other Civil War, Confederate currency cases include Hanauer v. Woodruff , 82 U.S. (15 Wall.) 439 (1872) , wherein a note 17 given in considerat ion of Confederate bonds was voided on principles of illegal consideration; see also Planters Bank of 18 Tennessee v. Union Bank of Louisiana , 83 U.S. (16 Wall.) 483 (1873) ; The Atlantic, Tennessee and Ohio Railroad 19 Company v. Carolina National Bank , 86 U.S. (19 Wall.) 548 (1873) ; and Stewart v. Salamon , 94 U.S. 434 (1877) . 20 In reference to the lawfulness of the \"greenback\" currency of the Union, this issue involved not one single case but a 21 multiple of cases spanning some 15 years. Before deliver ing any opinion wherein a challenge to the constitutionality of the 22 Legal Tender Acts was concerned, the U.S. Supreme Court rendered certain opinions in cases related to this issue. In 23 Bronson v. Rodes , 74 U.S. (7 Wall.) 229 (1869), the Court held that a bond requiring payment in specie coin could not be 24 discharged by paying \"greenbacks\": 25 \"The design of all this minuteness and strictness in th e regulation of coinage is easily seen. It indicates the 26 intention of the legislature to give a sure guaranty to the people that the coins made current in payments 27 contain the precise weight of gold or silver of the precise degree of purity declared by the statute. It recognizes 28 the fact accepted by all men throughout the world, that value is inherent in the precious metals; that gold and 29 silver are in themselves values, and being such, * * * are the only proper measures of value; that these values 30 are determined by weight and purity; and that form and impress are simply certificates of value worthy of 31 absolute reliance only because of the known integrity and good faith of the government which gives them. 32 \"The propositions just stated are believed to be incontestable. If they are so in fact, the inquiry concerning the 33 legal import of the phrase 'dollars payable in gold and silver coin, lawful money of the United States,' may be 34 answered without much difficulty. Each such dollar is a piece of gold or silver, certified to be of a certain 35 weight and purity, by the form and impress given to it at the mint of the United States, and therefore declared to 36 be legal tender in payments. Any number of such dollars is the number of grains of standard gold or silver in 37 one dollar multiplied by the given number,\" 74 U.S., at 249 -50. 38 In the case immediately following Bronson , supra, the Court, in Butler v. Horowitz , 74 U.S. (7 Wall.) 258 (1869) , held the 39 same way in reference to a contract requiring payment in specie. In New York v. Supervisors, County of New York , 74 U.S. 40 (7 Wall.) 26 (1869) , the Court held that legal tender Treasury notes were exempt from state taxation. 41 By 1870, some 8 years after the adoption of the first Legal Tender Act in 1862, the Court was finally required to pass upon 42 the constitutionality of those acts. As noted above, the Kentucky Supreme Court had held these acts to be unconstitutional 43 in Griswold v. Hepburn , supra, and it was to this case that the Supreme Court gran ted certiorari. The chief architect of the 44 Legal Tender Acts had been Treasury Secretary Chase, who by now was sitting on the Court as its Chief Justice, and it was 45 Chase who wrote the majority opinion in Hepburn v. Griswold , 75 U.S. 603, 625 (1870) . The issue in this case involved 46 whether legal tender notes could be used to discharge a debt contracted before the passage of the first legal tender a ct, and 47 this determination necessarily involved the constitutionality of those Congressional acts. Chase noted in the opinion that th e 48 legislation adopted by Congress making Treasury notes a legal tender occurred at the height of troubling times and that t he 49 motive for the acts was patriotic in nature; this was obviously stated because of his own personal involvement in obtaining 50 passage of the acts. Nonetheless, and notwithstanding personal motives and convictions which certainly played a part in 51 passage o f this legislation, it was time to test the conformity of the acts with the U.S. Constitution. Chase analyzed the 52 specific provisions of the Constitution which granted Congress various powers, and determined there was no express grant 53"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":" The Money Scam 62 of 120 Copyright Sovereignty Education and Defense Ministry, http://sedm.org Form 05.041, Rev. 10- 18- 200 9 EXHIBIT:________ to declare Treasury n otes a legal tender. There being no such express grant, he then examined specific Congressional 1 powers to determine if any implied power would sustain the acts. He examined the power to coin money, to borrow, to 2 regulate commerce and to declare war, but th ere he found no method for developing an implied power which would uphold 3 the acts. He examined the spirit of the Constitution as well as certain prohibitions contained therein, none of which could b e 4 useful in supporting an implied power. Finding no suppo rt for the constitutionality of the challenged acts, he found them 5 unconstitutional: 6 \"We are obliged to conclude that an Act making mere promises to pay dollars a legal tender in payment of 7 debts previously contracted, is not a means appropriate, plainly adapted, really calculated to carry into effect 8 any express power vested in Congress; that such an Act is inconsistent with the spirit of the Constitution; and 9 that it is prohibited by the Constitution.\" 10 It must have taken considerable courage for a man su ch as Chase, in high public office in the Lincoln administration and 11 who had sought these acts, to declare his own actions unconstitutional. 12 The decision in Hepburn had been pending for 2 years, and during the interim Congress decided to increase the number of 13 Justices on the Supreme Court from 8 to 9. The decision in Hepburn was a 5 to 3 decision, but shortly before the rendering 14 of that opinion, Justice Grier resigned from the Court for health reasons. This resignation made the number of Justices on 15 the Court who opposed this legislation be 4, with 3 remaining who supported the acts. 16 On the same day that Hepburn was decided, President Grant nominated two men, William Strong and Joseph Bradley, to 17 fill the vacancies on the Court. After confirmation, the n ew Court was requested to reconsider the constitutionality of the 18 Legal Tender Acts at the request of the U.S. Attorney General. This event has lead to the charge that Grant \"packed\" the 19 Court for the express purpose of securing a favorable ruling on the c hallenged acts. 20 At the time of the rendition of Hepburn , the Supreme Court had pending before it two other cases which concerned the 21 validity of the Legal Tender Acts, which cases had come to the Court at the same time as Hepburn . After Strong and 22 Bradley came to the Court, these other two cases were reargued in February and April, 1871. On May 1, 1871, the Supreme 23 Court rendered its opinion in Knox v. Lee , 79 U.S. 457, 534 (1871) , which overruled Hepburn and found the Legal Tender 24 Acts to be constitutional. Justice Strong delivered the majority opinion in Knox , and he upheld the Legal Tender Acts as 25 constitutional on the basis of auxiliary powers possessed by Congress: 26 \"And here it is to be observed it is not indispensable to the existence of any power claimed for the Federal 27 government that it can be found specified in the words of the Constitution, or clearly and directly traceable to 28 some one of the specified powers. Its existence may be deduced fairly from more than one of the substantive 29 powers expressly defined, or from them all combined. It is allowable to gro up together any number of them and 30 infer from them all that the power claimed has been conferred.\" 31 To sustain these acts, Strong used McCulloch v. Maryland analysis to find them constitutional, without specifying the 32 precise origin from which such a result ing or auxiliary power was derived from any particular single power or group of 33 powers. In effect, Justice Strong merely pointed to the Constitution and said the power arose from that instrument. 34 However, he made no attempt to address the extremely powerful arguments against the acts made by Clarkson Potter other 35 than to state: 36 \"The Legal Tender Acts do not attempt to make paper a standard of value. We do not rest their validity upon the 37 assertion th at their omission is coinage, or any regulation of the value of money; nor do we assert that 38 Congress may make anything which has no value money. What we do assert is that Congress has power to 39 enact that the government's promises to pay money shall be for the time being equivalent in value to the 40 representative of value determined by the coinage acts or to multiplies thereof. It is hardly correct to speak of a 41 standard of value * * * It is, then, a mistake to regard the Legal Tender Acts as either fixing a standard of value 42 or regulating money values, or making that money which has no intrinsic value,\" 79 U.S., at 553. 43 Dissenting from the decision in Knox were Chief Justice Chase, and Justices Clifford and Field, who rose to the occasion 44 and set forth inn umerable law, facts and arguments against the acts. 45 The decision in Knox resolved the issue of the constitutionality of federal \"bills of credit\" during war, but it was still an 46 open question as to their use in times of peace. In 1875, Congress enacted the Specie Resumption Act, which became 47 effective in 1879. In 1878, Congress passed additional legislation permitting the reissuance of Treasury notes after 48 redemption. By 1884, the Supreme Court was confronted with the issue of whether legal tender Treasury notes could be 49"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":" The Money Scam 63 of 120 Copyright Sovereignty Education and Defense Ministry, http://sedm.org Form 05.041, Rev. 10- 18- 200 9 EXHIBIT:________ reissued in peacetime. In Juilliard v. Greenman , 110 U.S. 421, 448 (1884) , the Supreme Court expanded the Knox doctrine 1 to allow peacetime issuance of legal tender Treasury notes: 2 \"Congress is authorized to establish a national currency, either in coin or in paper, and to make that currency 3 lawful money for all purposes, as regards the national government or private individuals.\" 4 In writing this opinion, Justice Gray successfully located the origin of this power in the express grant to Congress to 5 \"borrow money;\" this was appare nt notwithstanding the fact that the microscopic examination of the Constitution by Justice 6 Strong in Knox failed to reveal the source of this hidden power. As justification for this holding, Justice Gray relied upon 7 the sovereign powers of European govern ments, something which was totally new to construction of the American 8 Constitution. 9 The dissents in both Knox and Juilliard were exceptionally well written and documented rebuttals of the erroneous findings 10 of historical fact relied upon by the majority in both cases. Justice Field aptly stated the case of the dissenters by noting that 11 no jurist or statesman in our country, prior to the Civil War, ever mentioned or alluded to the power so readily found by the 12 majority in both Knox and Juilliard ; \"All conc eded, as an axiom of constitutional law, that the power did not exist,\" 110 13 U.S., at 454. The defects in findings of historical fact, argument and reasoning in both cases were ably pointed out by 14 George Bancroft in his work, A Plea for the Constitution , wr itten in direct response to the Juilliard decision. If Bancroft did 15 not fully destroy the fallacies of Juilliard , Dr. Edwin Vieira in his book, Pieces of Eight , has conclusively done so. 16 It is not the capable works as above described which have limited the scope of the Legal Tender Cases; instead, it is the 17 decisions of the same Court which rendered both Knox and Juilliard that define the limits of the legal tender powers of 18 Congress. A full two years before the Supreme Court decided Hepburn and three year s before Knox , the Supreme Court 19 determined a limitation on federal \"bills of credit\" in the case of Lane County v. Oregon , 74 U.S. (7 Wall.) 71, 77 (1868). 20 The rationale found in both Perry v. Washburn , supra, and in State Treasurer v. Collector , supra, was followed in Lane 21 County , and the Court there held that a state law requiring taxes to be paid in specie coin could not be circumvented by 22 payment in \"greenbacks,\" reasoning: 23 \"There is nothing in the Constitution which contemplates or authorizes any dir ect abridgement of this power by 24 national legislation.\" 25 Lane County was rendered by the same Court which rendered Hepburn and the majority of which decided Knox . And a 26 similar case was rendered after Juilliard , that case being Hagar v. Reclamation District No. 108 , 111 U.S. 701, 706 (1884) , 27 decided only 2 months after Juilliard . In Hagar , one issue involved the type of currency to be used to discharge a liability 28 for state taxes. In holding that such taxes had to be paid in specie coin pursuant to state law, Justi ce Field relied upon Lane 29 County and stated: 30 \"The extent to which the power of taxation of the state should be exercised, the subjects upon which it should be 31 exercised, and the mode in which it should be exercised, were all equally within the discretion of its legislature, 32 except as restrained by its own constitution and that of the United States.\" 33 To determine the full scope of the alleged legal tender powers of Congress, reliance upon the Juilliard decision alone is 34 insufficient. Knox merely found the e xistence of the federal power to emit bills of credit, without specifying any source 35 other than auxiliary or resulting powers; the scope of this power is not mentioned in Knox and can only be found by looking 36 at the style of the case, the names being indiv iduals. But Knox did not in any way destroy Bronson v. Rodes , supra, which 37 required specie payment if a contract called for such. Nor did Knox in any way destroy the efficacy of Lane County , 38 wherein state taxes were required to be paid in specie coin. Juil liard is only important for specifically defining the full 39 scope of the legal tender powers of Congress; there, the Court described the full reach of the Congressional power of legal 40 tender as only affecting the relationship between citizens and the nation al government, and among citizens, in a federal 41 forum. The decision of Hagar , which closely followed Juilliard , continued the principal that federal legal tender powers 42 could not constitutionally affect the relationship between a citizen of a state and his state government. What appears as a 43 broad statement of federal currency powers in Juilliard is not as all encompassing as many would imagine. The limit of 44 Congressional legal tender power is set forth in the Constitution in Article 1, § 10, cl. 1 , which is the very subject of this 45 brief. And in accordance with Article 1, § 10, clause 1, both Oregon and California had state laws requiring payment of 46 taxes in specie, and these laws were not voided by the exercise of the Cong ressional legal tender power. 47"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":" The Money Scam 64 of 120 Copyright Sovereignty Education and Defense Ministry, http://sedm.org Form 05.041, Rev. 10- 18- 200 9 EXHIBIT:________ An additional point of consideration arises from the fact that neither Knox or Juilliard sanctioned an irredeemable currency. 1 The court in Knox expressly held that representatives of federal liability, Treasury notes, were to be taken as the equal of 2 coin, with the understanding that these notes would eventually be paid. Redemption began in 1879, and at the time of the 3 Juilliard decision, such notes were convertible into specie coin. The Court has never sanctioned the complete suspension of 4 specie payment, as was plainly demonstrated in Ward v. Smith , 74 U.S. 447 (1869) : 5 \"Notes not thus current at their par value, nor redeemable on presentation, are not a good tender to principal 6 or agent, whether they are objected to at the time or not,\" 74 U.S., at 451 -52. 7 Therefore, a federal currency which is not redeemable in specie coin is repugnant to the Constitution. 8 For this second period in the history of the monetary provisions of the Constitution, the paramount events concerned the 9 Supreme Court decisions on the legal tender acts, and the establishment of the Federal Reserve System in 1913. But, before 10 considering the Federal Reserve issue, it is crucial to first discuss the power of Congress to delegate legislative functions. 11 Perhaps one of the most significant cases regarding Congressional delegation of authority is that of Field v. Clark , 143, 12 U.S. 649, 12 S.Ct. 495 (1892) , wherein this issue of authority of Congress to delegate was considered. Although the Court 13 there upheld the challenged delegation, the decision plainl y stated that the Constitution prevented a delegation of legislative 14 power by Congress to any person or entity. The Court reasoned that there was a distinct difference between delegation of 15 legislative power, which is unlawful, and authority or discretion vested in some official as to execution of the law, which is 16 permitted. In Union Bridge Company v. United States , 204 U.S. 364, 27 S.Ct. 367 (1907) , the Court noted the requirement 17 that an administrative agency had to give notice of hearings, conduct hearings and afford an opportunity to be heard in 18 order to proceed against a party adversely; see also Hampton and Company v. United States , 276 U.S. 394, 48 S.Ct. 348 19 (1928) . In United States v. Grimaud , 220 U.S. 506, 31 S.Ct. 480 (1911) , the Court upheld the use of agency rules and 20 regulations as the basis for a criminal prosecution, the reason being that Congress had set forth in its legislation standards 21 for such rules. In United States v. Shreveport Grain and Elevator Company , 287 U.S. 77, 53 S.Ct. 42 (1932) , the 22 requirement of rules and regulations for agencies was demonstrated. 23 But, it is 3 cases dec ided by the Supreme Court in 1935 and 1936 which are of particular significance to the issue of 24 Congressional delegation. In Panama Refining Company v. Ry an , 293 U.S. 388, 55 S.Ct. 241 (1935) , the challenged 25 legislation involved Congressional delegation to the President of extraordinary powers over oil, which were virtually 26 dictatorial. The Supreme Court held the purported Congressional delegation to be violative of the Constitution for the 27 reason that the act itself declared no policy, established no standard, and had no rules for action, required no findings of fact 28 and thus empowered the President with unprecedented, uncontrolled legislative power to act in whatever way he deemed 29 appropriate. In Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States , 295 U.S. 495, 537, 55 S.Ct. 837 (1935) , the challenged legislation 30 involved a delegation of authority to industrial trade groups to enact certain codes to regulate trade in the poultry industr y. 31 This act was likewise found unconstitutional by th e Court, it being stated that \"a delegation of legislative power is unknown 32 to our law, and is utterly inconsistent with the constitutional prerogatives and duties of Congress.\" In Carter v. Carter Coal 33 Company , 298 U.S. 238, 56 S.Ct. 855 (1936) , the challenged act involved delegation of legislative power to private coal 34 producer boards to control the coal industry through codes similar to those mentioned in Schechter . The Court was 35 particularly offended at the attempt to delegate legislative power to a private group and likewise found the legislation 36 unconstitutional. Thus, the rule of the cases demonstrates that, in order for Congress to delegate discretionary power to any 37 entity, the legislation permitting such must set forth a Congressional purpose and policy , a standard for action in conformity 38 with that policy, and guidelines for rules, procedures, finding of fact by the delegate, and administrative procedures which 39 afford due process of law. The delegate of legislative power simply has authority to act purs uant to the authority of the 40 statute and \"fill in the details\" by following Congressional intent. 41 In 1907, a money panic occurred which many have concluded was cause d by deliberate international gold shipments which 42 affected bank reserves. As a result of the damage caused by this panic, the people of our nation and various politicians 43 agitated for monetary reform. Paul Warburg, a German who immigrated to our country i n 1902 and who was an officer of 44 the banking firm of Kuhn Loeb and Company, thereafter proposed a great central bank in the European tradition. Congress 45 established a monetary commission to study this proposal, and the multitude of reports so made can now be found in the 46 Senate and House Documents and Reports of that period. In 1909, the 16th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, the 47 income tax amendment, was proposed and it was eventually, allegedly, ratified in February, 1913. The income tax is a 48"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":" The Money Scam 65 of 120 Copyright Sovereignty Education and Defense Ministry, http://sedm.org Form 05.041, Rev. 10- 18- 200 9 EXHIBIT:________ condition precedent for any fiat currency system. Between 1909 and 1913, the proposed central bank plan began to take 1 shape; finally, the Federal Reserve Act was refined enough to secure its passage and enactment on December 23, 1913. 17 2 The Federal Reserve Act as p romoted to the American public by its proponents gave the outward appearance that the 3 \"Money Trust\" was being destroyed and was being replaced by a governmental agency which would operate for the benefit 4 of the public. It was necessary that the American pe ople be defrauded and deceived because the Act did not dethrone the 5 \"Money Trust\" but in fact granted to that Trust thereto fore vast and unknown powers. As noted at the beginning of this 6 brief, private groups have always desired to have the power to provi de currency to a nation and this act in fact gave the 7 Juilliard powers of Congress to a private, powerful, financial group. 8 The Act 18 established 12 privately owned Federal Reserve Banks, the stock in which was to be, and is now, owned by 9 member banks whi ch are likewise privately owned. These 12 private, regional central banks comprised the whole system 10 known as the Federal Reserve System. The only public attribute of this system arose from the fact that the System was to be 11 controlled by a 12 man Board of Governors, 7 of whom were to be appointed by the President. Without question, the 12 System as constructed in this legislation, and now, is totally private, having only some titular \"public\" heads. The financia l 13 powers that sought and obtained this legislati on desired a complete privately owned system with enough public facade to 14 render a deceptive appearance. Not only does the legislation disclose the private nature of this System, the federal courts o f 15 our nation have now recognized this fact; see Lewis v. United States , 680 F.2d 1239 (9th Cir. 1982) . 19 16 The original act establishing the Federal Reserve System authorized the issuance of Federal Reserve Notes which were to 17 be redeemed in \"lawful money of the United States;\" see 12 U.S.C. §411 . Prior to its repeal in 1994, 12 U.S.C. §152 18 defined \"lawful money\" to be gold and silver coin, and therefore the act called for specie redemption of such notes. The fact 19 that such notes were also deemed \"obligations\" of the United States conclusively shows that the Juilliard powers of 20 Congress were conveyed to the System, since such powers were ostensibly derived from the Congressional power to 21 \"bo rrow money.\" 22 Since the Federal Reserve Act conveyed to a private banking cartel a very substantial Congressional power, the question 23 naturally arises as to whether this legislation is constitutional on this basis. It is unnecessary to consider the infinit e, 24 numerous transactions of the System such as its open market operations, discount operations and flagrant, abusive, tortious 25 manipulations of the reserve requirement ratio. Since the only crucial link to the Juilliard powers of Congress consists of 26 the f act that Federal Reserve Notes are U.S. obligations, analysis can be limited to this one aspect. Here, Congress in the 27 Act established no discernible policy or purpose insofar as the issuance of such obligations is concerned; there is no 28 standard by which action taken pursuant to such nonexistent policy can be controlled; there are no rules, regulations or 29 procedures to be followed concerning the issuance of these obligations; there are no requirement for finding of facts in 30 reference to issuance of these o bligations; and certainly there are no administrative procedures such as public hearings and 31 opportunity to be heard. It appears that the conveyance of Congressional Juilliard powers to these banks was an outright 32 gift to a very powerful, self interested f inancial group, subject to no control or restraint by Congress. The Federal Reserve 33 System was given unbridled power to expand or contract the number and amount of outstanding federal \"bills of credit.\" 34 This legislation is unconstitutional for this reason. 35 It is \"fortunate\" that the Federal Reserve System was in place just in time for World War I. The System was successful in 36 creating instantly all the additional credit needed to finance that great conflict. Federal bonds were sold to the System in 37 exchang e for credit extended to the government for the bonds. Further, these bonds became the basis upon which Federal 38 Reserve Notes were issued. As the war progressed, the paper currency and credit supply greatly expanded and this directly 39 caused inflation. 40 Wit h the successful conclusion of the War, the monetary powers in control of the Federal Reserve System schemed a 41 deliberate, premeditated, intentional contraction of the currency supply. The new Federal Reserve System had demonstrated 42 its currency expansion abilities and it was now time to test its contraction capabilities. On May 18, 1920, a secret meeting 43   17 The corrupt struggle involved in securing this certainly unconstitutional piece of legislation is definitively stated in Eustace Mullin's authoritative work, The Secrets of the Federal Reserve. 18 38 Stat. 251. 19 See also Comm. for Monetary Reform v.

During this meeting, plans were made which were shortly thereafter implemented to raise severely the 2 discount rate and reserve requirement ratio. The results were predictable and agriculture and its support industries received 3 a severe financial blow, all for the purpose of reducing prices. Much financial ruin was caused and those who were 4 damaged were without fault. Nonetheless, the System proved efficient at currency cont raction, thus laying the groundwork 5 for the Great Depression. 20 6 After this criminal and vicious currency contraction experiment, the System engaged in a general inflationary policy, which 7 created the \"roaring twenties.\" By 1926, 1927, and 1928, newspapers , bank officials, stockbrokers, and even the President 8 and state governors commented on the \"good\" times and encouraged everyone to enter the stock market because \"prosperity 9 was now here.\" However, sometime in the spring or summer of 1929, plans similar t o those devised on May 18, 1920, must 10 have been made, and these plans were obviously made operational before October, 1929. On October 29, 1929, the 11 speculative bubble caused by the inflationary policy of the \"Fed\" was burst and the Great Depression was ushered into our 12 nation. Fortunes are made not only by inflationary currency policies but contractionary policies as well. The trick is to 13 know when they will occur; those who knew made fortunes during the Depression, compliments of the System created by 14 Congress. 15 While the Great Depression was caused by improvident currency and credit contraction, the Federal Reserve System still at 16 that time possessed the same amount, if not more, ability to create credit . In fact, its credit creating potential is endless. The 17 System assuredly withdrew credit from the private sector of our economy to cause the Depression, but its credit creating 18 potential did not remain idle. Between the collapse in October, 1929, and June 1, 1933, the Federal Reserve Banks of our 19 nation used their credit capacity to purchase federal bonds payable in gold. By June 1, 1933, the entire System held 20 virtually all of the United States gold bonds which were to mature between June 1, 1933, and Jan uary 1, 1934. This 21 ownership of these bonds put the Federal Reserve Banks in a position to dictate the fate of the nation to Congress, and these 22 Banks exercised that power. 23 7.7 Period III: The War on Specie. 1933 to 1968 24 Franklin Roosevelt was inaugurated on March 4, 1933, at a very troubling time in the Depression. On March 6, 1933, 25 Roosevelt declared a banking holiday and closed the doors of the nation's banks; Roosevelt's authority to do such was based 26 upon the expired World War I Trading With the Enemy Ac t, 40 Stat. 411, which authorized the President to prevent 27 hoarding of gold, but which had expired at the termination of that War. Some of the banks closed as a result of Roosevelt's 28 proclamation never reopened, to the damage of their creditors, customer depositors. 29 Roosevelt also called an extra session of Congress for March 9, 1933. When the House convened, the 1933 Emergency 30 Banking Act was passed immediately with no copy of the proposed legislation provided to any House member and with 31 only 40 minutes debate. Never before or since was a piece of legislation \"railroaded\" as this one was. A similar railroad 32 occurred in the Senate, and at the end of the day, Roosevelt's after the fact legislative approval of his actions which close d 33 the banks became law. I n addition to this benefit, the new law enabled the Secretary of the Treasury to acquire possession 34 of all gold in the United States. With the new powers conferred upon him, Roosevelt extended the bank holiday, and on 35 March 10, 1933, issued another Executi ve Order the objective of which was to divest Americans of their right to possess 36 gold. Thus commenced a war upon gold initiated by an American President. 37 By June 1, 1933, a Congressional Joint Resolution, number 192 , was proposed to make it against public policy to pay any 38 obligation in gold. It was during the debate on this resolution that the fact was made known that the Federal Reserve Banks 39 possessed virtually all the federal gold clause bo nds to mature within the next 6 months. 21 This resolution was enacted on 40 June 5, 1933, and notwithstanding the fact that it was only a joint resolution, it was accorded the force of law. On August 41 28, 1933, Roosevelt issued another Executive Order which re quired information returns for gold ownership and prohibited 42 possession of gold except by license. Failure to file the required returns and possession of gold without license were made 43 criminal offenses. All the fervent work by Roosevelt to outlaw gold and make the federal government the biggest \"hoarder\" 44 of gold put American currency on the light, inconvertible currency standard. Such a standard was deemed \"modern\" like the 45   20 The story of this criminal meeting of May 18, 1920, is spread upon the pages of the Congressional Record of February 23, 1923 , pages 4362 through 4369. 21 See Cong ressional Record, June 1, 1933, page 4899."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":" The Money Scam 67 of 120 Copyright Sovereignty Education and Defense Ministry, http://sedm.org Form 05.041, Rev. 10- 18- 200 9 EXHIBIT:________ architecture of the 1930s and the \"boat tail\" Duesenbergs, Auburns, and Cords. 22 Th e final piece of legislation secured by 1 Roosevelt in his war upon gold ownership by American citizens was the Gold Reserve Act of January 30, 1934, 48 Stat. 2 337 . In the tradition used to obtain the Emergency Banking Act of 1933, this legislation was likewise railroaded through 3 Congress. Throughout this period, Roosevelt and Congress used an alleged \"national emergency\" as the predicate for the 4 hasty legislation and orders so issued. 5 As a direct and proximate result of the far reaching changes made in monetary law in 1933 and 1934, litigation on these 6 points arose. The 3 major Supreme Court decisions made as a consequence were Norman v. Baltimore and O. R. Co. , 294 7 U.S. 240, 55 S.Ct. 407 (1935), Nortz v. United States , 294 U.S. 317, 55 S.Ct. 428 (1935) , and Perry v. United States , 294 8 U.S. 330, 55 S.Ct. 43 2 (1935) . Norman , supra, dealt with a railroad bond payable in gold coin; Norman sought payment of 9 $38.10 on a bond pay able in the amount of $22.50, his basis for asking for more arising from the change made in the 10 statutory gold dollar. Seeing the inherent justice in denying relief to a person seeking more than he was entitled, the 11 Supreme Court in Norman denied the relie f sought. In Nortz , a plaintiff seeking similar relief got similar judgment as 12 Norman. Nortz had $106,300 in gold certificates and was forced to exchange the same for inconvertible currency of the 13 light standard. Based upon a higher market value of gold than legal value of the same, Nortz instituted suit to recover 14 $64,334.07, the alleged difference between the market price of gold and the legal price. The Court denied his request for 15 unjust enrichment. In Perry , the issue concerned a federal gold bond and the method of its payment in light of the June 5, 16 1933, Joint Resolution. Although the Court in Perry held the Joint Resolution to be unconstitutional insofar as it applied to 17 federal bonds, it ultimately determined that Perry had neither alleged nor prove n any damage in his breach of contract 18 action and was therefore not entitled to any. In this trilogy of cases, all parties were seeking a gain or benefit as a resul t of 19 the monetary changes caused by the President and Congress. The Joint Resolution of June 5, 1933, has no significance 20 today because it has been effectively repealed; see 91 Stat. 1229 , and Fay Corp. v. Frederick & Nelson Seattle, Inc. , 896 21 F.2d 1227 (9th Cir. 1990) , for explanation of the ending of HJR 192's application in 1977. 22 Since the monetary changes of the 1930s, the federal government has unilaterally ceased fulfilling its monetary 23 responsibilities required by the Constitution (its Marigold duties) and has allowed the function of providin g currency to the 24 nation to be assumed by the Federal Reserve System. The minting of dollars of silver ceased in the 1930s, and the gold 25 reserves so violently taken from the American people were used to support greater and greater quantities of notes as th e 26 gold reserve requirement was lowered over a span of many years. 27 The vacuum created by Congressional nonfeasance, or malfeasance, insofar as the currency system is concerned, enabled 28 the Federal Reserve System to play a greater and greater role in provid ing currency. This favorable environment followed 29 directly as a result of this System demonstrating its ability to bankrupt the federal government by the gold bonds it held 30 immediately prior to June 5, 1933. The open question is whether the Federal Reserve System did in fact obtain the gold 31 required to pay the gold bonds the System held at that time. A possible answer to this question appears to lie in the fact th at 32 the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has many tons of gold in its possession beneath the str eets of New York City and 33 the further fact that the Federal Reserve Banks claim a lien upon or title to all gold possessed by the government. 34 Since the debacle of the 1930s, the \"Fed\" has provided monumental amounts of credit to the Federal government to finance 35 World War II, the Korean War, and the vast increase in social programs enacted by Congress. The increasing quantities of 36 credit provided to the federal government has enabled it to acquire more and more control over the G.N.P. of our nation. 37 On th e day President Kennedy was buried, the first irredeemable Federal Reserve Notes were shipped from the U.S. 38 Treasury. Shortly thereafter, the Treasury consulted Merrill Jenkins, a nationally renown expert on vending machines, to 39 determine how \"slugs\" could be used to operate vending machines; Jenkins suggested a \"sandwiched\" coin. Thereafter, 40 President Johnson used the media to promote the idea of a silver shortage, and soon clad coins came into circulation 41 pursuant to the Coinage Act of 1965, 79 Stat. 254 . 42 Once debased clads had been provided to the nation by the Treasury, the one remaining step necessary to put the nation 43 itself on the \"fiat\" standard was to prevent r edemption of circulating notes with silver. This came in 1967 with the Silver 44 Certificate Act, 81 Stat. 77, which provided that redemption of silver certificates would end on June 24, 1968. On June 25, 45   22 For a more definitive analysis of this period, see Henry Mark Holzer's law review article entitled \" How Americans Lost Their Right To Own Gold - And Became Criminals in the Process ,\" 39 Brooklyn Law Review 517 ( 1973)."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":" The Money Scam 68 of 120 Copyright Sovereignty Education and Defense Ministry, http://sedm.org Form 05.041, Rev. 10- 18- 200 9 EXHIBIT:________ 1968, the nation was placed on a completely fiat monet ary standard; since then, the nation has been floating upon a \"vast 1 sea\" of paper money and credit. 2 7.8 Period IV: Fiat Law Equals Fiat Currency. 1968 to the Present 3 The Viet Nam war, or, properly, U.N. peacekeeping action, was financed with Federal Reserve credit; that war began for 4 our society the \"endless war for endless peace\" proposition of Orwell's 1984 . Since then, endless new wars labeled social 5 programs have increased in the federal government's unveiled attempt to reduce the entire U.S. economy to i ts control. 6 Such a blatant grab for power by the federal government could not have occurred with a constitutional monetary system. 7 The silver dollar, the \"dollar of our daddies,\" was killed prior to this period. It was replaced by \"bastard\" sons and daughters 8 such as the Eisenhower dollar and \"Susan B. Agony,\" which were utterly repugnant to the coins intended by the framers of 9 our Constitution. 10 President Nixon closed the \"gold window\" in 1971 to prevent foreign redemption of our paper currency with gold. But this 11 did not result in damage to those international holders of currency because the federal government provided compensation 12 via a vast foreign aid program. 13 Since 1968, federal budget deficits have vastly increased; the difference between federal revenues and federal expenditures 14 has been provided, in the majority, by new credit created by the \"Fed.\" This apparently alarming development has spawned 15 state efforts to amend the Constitution to provide for a balanced budget. The proponents of a balanced budget apparently 16 lack understanding of the precise social role played by budget deficits; if these advocates are successful in their endeavor, 17 the end of life as we know it here in the United States will surely come to an end. 18 The scientific art of creat ing booms or depressions for our economy has been fully developed by the \"Fed.\" This 19 organization can now totally control the U.S. economy, and this ability allows it to totally control any particular industry. 20 The past few years have clearly shown the abi lity of the \"Fed\" to attack any industry, be it the automotive, oil, or 21 transportation, and bring that industry into its control. The current industry under concerted attack by the creditor creator s is 22 agriculture. 23 Of particular significance presently is the war of the \"Fed\" against its own kind, private commercial banks. The Fed desires 24 to bring all banks directly under its control and to create out of some 14,000 independent banks a few large industry giants. 25 The fewer the number of banks, the greater th e control by the \"Fed.\" A deposit made into a bank in heartland America can 26 quickly result in credit extended to Red China. 27 There are many other detrimental effects to be noted as a result of the banishment of specie as the only component of our 28 monetary system and its replacement by fiat currency, but such would serve no purpose here. It only needs to be noted that 29 specie coin is \"free man's\" money; it is unpolitical and a circulating currency of specie coin cannot result in any 30 governmentally imposed fav oritism or benefit to debtors at the expense of creditors. Fiat currency, however, is political 31 money and can be used to favor one group against another or to destroy any group, including an independent sovereign 32 state. 33 7.9 The Impolicy of the Present Currency System 34 The U.S. Constitution was adopted, as stated in its preamble, to insure justice and promote domestic tranquility and 35 comparison of Congressional legislation and programs with such standards is beneficial notwithstanding the fact that the 36 preamble' s ideals have no legal import. If an act or program established by Congress conforms with these ideals, the merit 37 of the same becomes readily apparent. However, if any act or program is calculated to promote injustice or is disruptive of 38 popular tranquilit y, serious attention should be undertaken to neutralize these negative effects. The question of concern here 39 is whether the present currency system of the United States promotes or denies justice and domestic tranquility. 40 Any analysis of the current monet ary system must, of necessity, begin with an examination of the instruments of this 41 system, which consist of the \"clad\" coin, Federal Reserve Note and demand deposit. It is through these instruments, this 42 media of exchange, that the commerce of this nation is consummated. The apparent infirmity of all these instruments arises 43 from the fact that each is virtually worthless and cannot by any stretch of the imagination be considered a standard of value . 44"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":" The Money Scam 69 of 120 Copyright Sovereignty Education and Defense Ministry, http://sedm.org Form 05.041, Rev. 10- 18- 200 9 EXHIBIT:________ The cost to produce a \"clad\" coin is reputed to be less t han 10% of the face value. The penny is made of zinc with a copper 1 coating for purposes of deception; being some of the most common elements of the earth, they have relatively little value. 2 The \"higher\" coins are likewise made of the cheap, plentiful elements of copper and nickel. In reference to the Federal 3 Reserve Note, the cost to print the same is alleged to be $25.00 per 1000 bills, regardless of denomination. The substance of 4 that note is paper, made of extremely plentiful wood. The only redeeming qua lity of that note consists of its fancy 5 engraving, at least in comparison with other notes of the world. Notes used in other nations such as England and Saudi 6 Arabia have a \"comic book\" or bathroom tissue quality or appearance. 23 While clads and notes have an actual existence, 7 the same cannot be stated in reference to that \"instrument\" which plays the major role in our currency system, the demand 8 deposit. The demand deposit does not exist in reality, it having no physical form. Such a deposit cannot be brou ght to court 9 and placed into evidence. A demand deposit is nothing more than a chose in action; it is nothing more than a claim against a 10 financial institution such as a private commercial bank. It exists, if at all possible, only as an electronic \"glitch\" in the 11 memory of the computer terminals of the banks of our nation. While the quantity of clad coins and paper notes in 12 circulation is somewhat limited by resources and production, the total amount of demand deposits which can be produced is 13 virtually end less. 14 The defect of our present currency system insofar as the instruments thereof is concerned, consists of the total lack of any 15 quality or value. Barter is the system of exchange whereby property is directly exchanged for other and different property. 16 No one can be damaged by barter. Specie coin is an improvement of barter exchange; here exchange occurs via a common 17 form of property, gold or silver, and property and wealth are exchanged for property and wealth. Trade and commerce 18 achieved through the us e of specie coin is similar to barter and nobody gets damaged thereby. However, to prostitute the 19 specie coin exchange by replacing it with something of worthless value results in wealth and property being exchanged for 20 nothing of value. This is nothing more nor less than theft. Our nation is nothing more than a society of thieves and we steal 21 each other's wealth, property and labor with something that is inherently worthless. 22 However, while citizens of this nation unknowingly steal one from another, the c reators of these monetary instruments are 23 the greatest of thieves. The Federal Reserve Banks and all the private commercial banks of this nation are the creators of 24 Federal Reserve Notes and bank demand deposits. These institutions obtain whatever real res ources, wealth and labor they 25 need or desire merely by printing on paper and issuing credit. These institutions truly acquire everything they need or 26 desire, such as bank buildings, employee labor, farmlands or factories, for nothing but the cost of printi ng. 27 Another serious defect of our currency system consists of the fact that the supply of this purported currency can be 28 manipulated at will by the Federal Reserve System. By purchasing government bonds, the Federal Open Market Committee 29 can expand the credit supply; by selling bonds, it can contract that supply. By the Federal Reserve Board decreasing bank 30 reserve requirements, private banks c an increase deposits; the inverse works for an increase in the reserve requirement ratio. 31 The American people have absolutely no control over the volume of currency and credit in circulation. When the currency 32 supply is deliberately and intentionally decre ased by this manipulation, innocent victims are created who cannot repay 33 loans; this results in loss of property through foreclosure. 34 Perhaps the most reprehensible feature of our currency system arises from the fact that this currency originates by being 35 loaned into circulation. An apt example of this process is a fictional card game. Assume the existence of 4 card players who 36 borrow their playing cards from another person. The players execute and deliver notes promising to repay 13 cards plus 1 in 37 the wa y of interest in exchange for 13 cards with which to play. This process put into circulation among the players the 38 total sum of 52 cards. However, the aggregate liabilities of all the players is 56 cards, thus it is impossible for all playe rs to 39 extinguish the debt to the card owner. By loaning the cards into circulation, greater liabilities were created than there were 40 cards in circulation. The card owner creditor will surely acquire the collateral of the players through foreclosure. 41 Our currency originat es in the same identical fashion: it is loaned into circulation. Thus, our debt based currency system has 42 created greater liabilities among us than there is currency and credit in circulation. The world is full of demonstrations of 43 this principle. Mexico has borrowed and put into circulation a great amount of currency and credit. However, 44 notwithstanding the fact that the loan proceeds are put into circulation, if Mexico taxes that currency out of circulation to 45 repay the loan, it will only recover the prin cipal amount of the loan. The currency to pay interest never has an existence. 46 Here in the United States, the aggregate liabilities of our economy exceed all of the circulating currency and credit. We wil l 47 forever be in debt bondage so long as we continue to maintain the present currency system. 48   23 No slander of the American Banknote Company intended."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":" The Money Scam 70 of 120 Copyright Sovereignty Education and Defense Ministry, http://sedm.org Form 05.041, Rev. 10- 18- 200 9 EXHIBIT:________ In reference to the problem of the federal deficit, it must be noted that it plays a vital social role. Since our medium of 1 exchange is loaned or borrowed into circulation, only the aggregate principal of all loans is in circulation. The currency to 2 pay the interest does not exist. To provide the means to pay the annual interest charges the economy of our nation accrues, 3 the federal government via its budget deficits supplies new currency to the economy so that 85% to 90% of the interest can 4 be paid. So long as currency originates via the loaning mechanism, some part of society must bear the burden of providing 5 the currency to pay interest, and this role is being played by the budget deficit. If the federal government is prevented by 6 law from playing this crucial social role, then the private sector will have to assume that duty. It will take just a short t ime 7 to mortgage all of the assets of America if this should occur. Then, the credit creators will shut down the A merican 8 economy and foreclose on all of America. 9 The above are the principle defects of our currency system. This system is not designed to insure justice and promote 10 domestic tranquility. It is designed for the exact opposite. This system is not just unc onstitutional, it is anti constitutional. 11 The last refuge of the American people from sure and swift destruction at the hands of this monetary system is through the 12 judiciary of our nation. And a little known and totally unused law is ready and waiting to be used for this purpose. That law 13 is embodied in the \"Supreme Law of the Land;\" it is found in Article 1, § 10, cl. 1 of the U.S. Constitution. 14 7.10 Summary and Conclusions 15 John Adams once made a statement which aptly described the problems facing our nation: 16 \"All the perplexities, confusion and distress in America arise not from defects in our Constitution; not from 17 want of honor or virtue, so much as from downright ignorance of the nature of coin, credit and circulation.\" 18 For a brief period in our Constitutional history, the judiciary of our nation understood the true nature of coin, credit and 19 circulation. But when such knowledge became uncommon or forgotten, errors discernible only through history were 20 repeated, the conseq uences of which we are now suffering. 21 The common law, that ancient river of habit and custom of the English peoples flowing backward into time, dealt 22 decisively with the topic of money. At common law, money was only gold and silver coin; the minting of gold and silver 23 was performed by the King according to the ancient standard coin of the realm. There was no authority granted by the 24 people empowering the King with the prerogative to debase coin. But, as history has plainly shown, monarchs and other 25 forms o f government have frequently tended toward usurpation of power and abridgment of the rights of the people. 26 Whenever this has occurred, it has been necessary for the people to actively reclaim their lost liberties. 27 Although the common law precepts, maxims, and principles of money applied to the early colonial governments of our 28 nation, these governments considered themselves at liberty to violate the same. But, as the common law was nothing more 29 than an embodiment of natural, universal law, the violation thereof by colonial paper money emissions resulted in 30 punishment being administered by natural, universal law. Colonial paper money experiments, which spanned a century, 31 caused economic tribulation for everyone involved. 32 Shortly prior to the Revolutionary W ar, the baneful consequences of paper money had surely been perceived, but not to the 33 degree of severity to prohibit it altogether. It took the experience of the Revolutionary War to permanently imbed in the 34 mind of Americans that paper money was an evil o f the first order to be banished forever from our shores. 35 The paper money experiments of early America and the consequent disastrous results thereof were fresh in the minds of the 36 framers of the Constitution when they met in Philadelphia in 1787. When the y came to a consideration of the monetary 37 system to be constructed by the Constitution, they determined that a uniform specie currency must be the money of 38 America. To insure this uniformity, they empowered Congress with the right to coin money. While they did not choose to 39 transfer the legal tender power of the States to the federal government, they did place the limitation of Article 1, § 10, 40 clause 1 of the U.S. Constitution on that power and this limitation made only gold and silver coin the legal tender. Power to 41 declare a legal tender, limited to gold and silver, was expressly left in the possession of the States. 42 The intent of the framers in this respect is perfectly clear. Ever y single written record of this period confirms the 43 proposition that the Constitution absolutely commanded a specie currency and prohibited any governmentally sanctioned 44 paper money. There exist no records of this period that would slightly indicate any contrary intent. During the first period in 45"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":" The Money Scam 71 of 120 Copyright Sovereignty Education and Defense Ministry, http://sedm.org Form 05.041, Rev. 10- 18- 200 9 EXHIBIT:________ our constitutional history, the resounding voice of all three branches of government, state and federal, repeated the position 1 taken by the framers of the Constitution. All authorities uniformly agreed that the money of the Constitution was gold and 2 silver coin, and this was so because of express provision. At that time, there was not a single voice that denied this 3 principle, which was considered one of the highest principles of Constitutional law. 4 The advent of t he Civil War brought the supreme test to government. Although doubting the lawfulness of such a measure, 5 Congress authorized the emission of federal \"bills of credit.\" After having done so, Congressional damage to constitutional 6 principles had to withstand scrutiny by the judiciary of our nation. Some state courts voided the acts while others upheld 7 them. Resolution of this issue thereafter could only come from the U.S. Supreme Court. When the Supreme Court finally 8 spoke on this issue, it was through the voice of the very man who devised the legal tender acts in the first place. If there was 9 any man in the country then who knew perfectly well both sides of this issue, it was Chief Justice Chase. Chase had 10 personal reasons to uphold the validity of the acts, yet when he found the acts to be unconstitutional, he demonstrated 11 himself to be a jurist of the highest order. There certainly was never a member of the Supreme Court who was thrust into 12 this position, and there may never again be a similar situation. Cha se occupies a special place in the history of American 13 jurisprudence. 14 While the Hepburn decision followed the common law and all previous case law in America, political intrigue entered the 15 picture for the purpose of a direct assault upon the United State s Constitution. The success of this endeavor resulted in new 16 members on the Supreme Court, and one of these new members then wrote the opinion in Knox , which expressly overruled 17 Hepburn . Knox set a precedent in ways other than the issue of money; it starte d the trend away from the proposition that the 18 federal government is one of limited powers. If Knox rationale in reference to construction of Congressional constitutional 19 powers is followed, then every questionable exercise of power by the federal governme nt can and will be justified similarly, 20 with the proximate result being tyranny by the federal government. What the Supreme Court did in Knox was to amend the 21 U.S. Constitution without complying with Article V. 22 The subsequent legal tender case of Juilliar d not only refined Knox , but it placed a limit on its rationale. The scope of the 23 legal tender power does not abridge the powers and constitutional restraints on the States as that case demonstrated. And 24 this maxim is clearly shown when Juilliard is compar ed with the decisions in Lane County and Hagar . The net result is that 25 the Legal Tender Cases have not impinged upon or transgressed any part of the constraint upon the States as enumerated in 26 Article 1, § 10 . 27 If a crime against the law and mankind has ever occurred, then it was surely a crime that Congress committed when it 28 established in 1913 the Federal Reserve System. This act created 12 privately owned banks of issue, which were unified 29 into one system and then given a publi c facade for appearance sake. For no consideration and without any restraints being 30 placed upon the grant, Congress empowered these banks to issue notes which were deemed to be obligations of the federal 31 government. 32 After creation, these banks assumed qui ckly a prominent position in the financial affairs of this nation which they have ever 33 since held. Their power was adversely exercised in 1920 and 1921 and the result was a depression in agriculture. 34 Thereafter, these banks created a boom which ended in th e worst economic calamity known to modern man, the Great 35 Depression. 36 During the Depression, these banks readied a war against the federal government. Gold and silver coins have always been 37 and always will be the enemy of paper money. The friends of paper money during this dark era in our history made certain 38 that gold would never again offend them; the embarrassing predicament in which they placed the federal government was 39 sufficient to cause the federal government to take an action unprecedented in the a nnals of the history of money. This action 40 was the bold move to divest all gold from the possession of the American citizens and to forever lock it up in the vaults of 41 Fort Knox . All of this occurred during a \"national emergency,\" and this emergency was the predicate for the actions taken. 42 The knowledge and experience gained by the central bankers in the 30's was put to use in the 1960s when a very silent war 43 against silver was conducted, which resulted in the oblit eration of all connections between this precious metal and our 44 currency. While the attention of the American public was focused upon the preparations for sending men to the moon, one 45 of the deadliest social diseases ever known to man, fiat money, was intro duced to our nation. 46"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":" The Money Scam 72 of 120 Copyright Sovereignty Education and Defense Ministry, http://sedm.org Form 05.041, Rev. 10- 18- 200 9 EXHIBIT:________ Today, the currency system in our country is totally privately owned and controlled; it is manipulated at will and is 1 specifically designed to conquer financially the American people. The chief bank note which this system issues is totally 2 irredeemable. These notes, in addition to credit claims against the Federal Reserve Banks, constitute the reserves upon 3 which the nation's private banks issue a multiple of demand deposits, which are likewise irredeemable. The issue of all 4 these priv ate banks is plainly unconstitutional. And this entire system has been imposed upon the American people with 5 irresistible force and power. Is our entire currency system as unconstitutional as the Confederate currency system described 6 in Thorington ? 7 Since the advent of the fiat paper money, our nation has suffered from the identical ills which the framers of the 8 Constitution endured. Inflation is endemic, taxes are constantly rising, crime is rampant, Americans are unemployed, and 9 that great institution, th e American family, is about to disintegrate. These are always the direct social consequences 10 whenever any nation has permitted its currency to be debauched and replaced with paper, as history has clearly shown. 11 Neither the national executive or legislativ e branches display any inclination to remedy this severe social problem. Further, 12 state governors and legislators are afflicted with a lack of knowledge of the true nature of coin, credit and circulation and 13 are thus impotent to offer redress. However, the judiciary of our nation does offer hope and has a ready remedy: it can 14 implement and revitalize the perfect solution found in Article 1, § 10, clause 1 of the U.S. Constitution. 15 8 History of Redeemability of Federal Res erve Notes in Gold and Silver 16 From the beginning of the Federal Reserve in 1913, it was intended that \"Federal Reserve Notes\" would represent the dollar 17 at a ratio of $1 in \"Federal Reserve Notes\" to be equal to $1 in value ... but by 1935; the ratio of gold to \"Federal Reserve 18 Notes\" had slipped to 40% and at that time it was enacted: 19 \"Every Federal Reserve Bank shall maintain reserves in gold certificates, or lawful money of not less than 35% 20 against its deposits, and reserves in gold certificates of not less than 40% against its Federal Reserve notes in 21 actual circulation.\" 22 [12 U .S.C. § 413, as enacted on August 23, 1935 ] 23 Now the ratio was esta blished at $2.50 in \"Federal Reserve Notes\" to be equal to $1 in value; however, this, too, did not 24 last for long; in less than 10 years, the ratio had changed once more, and out of necessity the reserve requirements were 25 reduced to 25% (see the \"Act\" of J une 12, 1945, 59 Stat. 237). 26 The \"Act\" of June 12, 1945, established a new ratio for the value; at that time $4 in \"Federal Reserve Notes\" circulating that 27 the banks and the government were beginning to become nervous; they then enacted legislation to attempt to curb the 28 redemption of \"Federal Reserve Notes\" by restricting the Federal Reserve banks from paying out \"Notes\" of another 29 Federal Reserve bank (See \"Act\" of July 19, 1954, 68 Stat. 495 ). 30 By 1965, all was totally lost; the ratio of \"Federal Reserve Notes\" then circulation and Bank Credit to the value standard 31 was approaching $400 to $1; that is to say, 400 \"Federal Reserve Notes\" to be equal to $1 in value. It was out of desperate 32 necessity that Congress enacted legislation eliminating reserve requirements altogether (See \"Act\" of March 3, 1965, 79 33 Stat. 5 ). 34 By 1968, Congress finally admitted what was known for some 35 years, that the \"Notes\" were hopelessly depreciated and 35 no possibility of redemption existed (See \"Act\" of March 18, 1968, 28 Stat. 50). 36 If history is at all accurate, we can soon expect Congress to issue a n ew Currency to be used to replace the present Currency 37 at a discount of approximately 100 to 1 or 100 \"Federal Reserve Notes\" for 1 Note of the new Currency. If any less of a 38 depreciation is maintained at that time, subsequent changes in Currency must prevail until that level is attained. 39 This was exemplified as recently as 1780, 193 years ago our Currency followed the same path and ultimately died in the 40 hands of those who possessed it. 41 \"Almost the first financial steps of Congress after the hostilities began was to vote an issue of paper money, and 42 within a week of the battle of Bunker Hill, under date of June 22, 1775 authority was given for an issue of 43 $2,000,000. of bills of credit, based upon the credit of the States with a careful apportionment of the amount 44 each colony should redeem between 1779 and 1782.

Their \"Note\" is worthless abroad and 35 rapidly declining at home. It is perhaps the only opportunity we shall have in the next sixty years to escape total 36 enslavement by allowing the Currency to collapse. It will harm no one; the Federal government would be let out of a 465 37 billion dollar debt and the American consumers would be let out of a 3 trillion dollar debt all owed to these privately owned 38 banks; but our government will not allow this to happen. The government will treat the bank paper (\"Money\") as their 39 obligation and enslave the people it is instead supposed to be protecting in a feeble attempt to maintain this insane system 40 of finance.

Public - and private - 2 sector analysts have long monitored this growth because of the effects that it is believed to have on real economic activity 3 and on the price level 25 . The money supply is consider ed an important instrument for controlling inflation by economists 4 who say that growth in money supply will only lead to inflation if money demand is stable 26 . 5 9.1 Convention s 6 Because (in principle) money is anything that can be used in settlement of a debt , there are varying measures of money 7 supply. Since most modern economic systems are regulated by governments through monetary policy , the supply of money 8 is broken down into types of money based on how much of an effect monetary policy can have on that type of money. 9 Narrow money is the type of money that is more easily affected by monetary policy whereas broad money is more 10 difficult to affect through monetary policy [5] . Narrow money exists in smaller quantities while broad money exists in much 11 larger quantities . Each type of money can be classified by placing it along a spectrum between narrow (easily affected) and 12 broad (difficult to affect) money. The different types of money are typically classified as M's . The number of M's usually 13 range from M0 (most narrow ) to M3 (broadest) but which M's are actually used depends on the system. The typical layout 14 for each of the M's is as follows: 15 • M0 : Physical currency . A measure of the money supply which combines any liquid or cash assets held within a 16 central bank and the amount of physical currency circulating in the economy. M0 (M -zero) is the most liquid 17 measure of the money supply. It only includes cash or assets that could quickly be converted into currency. This 18 measure is known as narrow money because it is the smallest measure of the money supply. [6] 19 • M1 : M0 + demand deposits, which are checking accounts . This is used as a measurement for economists trying to 20 quantify the amount of money in circulation. The M1 is a very liquid measure of the money supply, as it contains 21 cash and assets that can quickly be converted to currency. [7] 22 • M2 : M1 + all time -related deposits, savings deposits, and non -institutional money -market funds. M2 is a broader 23 classification of money than M1. Economists use M2 when looking to quant ify the amount of money in circulation 24 and trying to explain different economic monetary conditions. [8] M2 is key economic indicator used to forecast 25 inflation. [9] 26 • M3 : M2 + all large time deposits, institutional money -market funds, short -term repurchase agreements, along with 27 other larger liquid assets. The broadest mea sure of money ; it is used by economists to estimate the entire supply 28 of money within an economy. [10] 29 9.2 Fractional -reserve banking 30 The different forms of money in government money supply statistics arise from the practice of fractional -reserve banking . 31 Whenever a bank gives out a loan in a fractional -reserve ba nking system, a new type of money is created. This new type of 32 money is what makes up the non- M0 components in the M1 -M3 statistics. In short, there are two types of money in a 33 fractional -reserve banking system 2728 : 34   24 Extracted from Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_supply on 4/13/2008. 25 The Money Supply - Federal Reserve Bank of New York 26 a b money supply Definition 27 Bank for International Settlements - The Role of Central Bank Money in Payment Systems.

The M2 me asure is thought to be held primarily by 6 households. The third aggregate, M3, which is no longer published, included M2 plus certain accounts that are held by 7 entities other than individuals and are issued by banks and thrift institutions to augment M2- typ e balances in meeting credit 8 demands; it also includes balances in money market mutual funds held by institutional investors. The aggregates have had 9 different roles in monetary policy as their reliability as guides has changed. The following details their principal 10 components [14] : 11 • M0 : The total of all physical currency , plus accounts at the central bank that can be exchanged for physical 12 currency. 13 • M1 : M0 - those portions of M0 held as reserves or vault cash + the amount in demand accounts (\"checking\" or 14 \"current\" accounts). 15 • M2 : M1 + most savings accounts , money market accounts , a nd small denomination time deposits ( certificates of 16 deposit of under $100,000). 17 • M3 : M2 + all other CDs (large time deposits, institutional money market mutual fund balances), deposits of 18 eurodollars and repurchase agreements . 19 The Federal Reserve ceased publishing M3 statistics in March 2006, explaining that M3 did not appear to convey additional 20 information about economic activity compared to M 2, had not been used in determining economic policy, and that the costs 21 to collect M3 data outweighed the benefits.

The exemption applies to each form of taxation that would require the obligation, the 7 interes t on the obligation, or both, to be considered in computing a tax, except - 8 (1) a nondiscriminatory franchise tax or another nonproperty tax instead of a franchise tax, imposed on a 9 corporation; and 10 (2) an estate or inheritance tax. 11 (b) The tax status o f interest on obligations and dividends, earnings, or other income from evidences of 12 ownership issued by the Government or an agency and the tax treatment of gain and loss from the disposition of 13 those obligations and evidences of ownership is decided unde r the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 ( 26 U.S.C. 1 14 et seq.).

This subsection does not apply to obligations and evidences of ownership issued by the 17 District of Columbia, a territory or possession of the United States, or a department, agency, instrumentality, or 18 political subdivision of the District, territory, or possession 19 Therefore, your Federal Reserve Notes (FRN’s) are not taxable by federal State governments, because they aren’t really 20 lawful money, but debt obligations, or the equivalent of corporate government bonds! For more interesting reading, we 21 refer you to the L egal Tender Cases, Juilliard v. Greenman, 110 U.S. 421 (1884) . 22 “Under the power to borrow money on the credit of the United States, and to issue circulating notes for the 23 money borrowed, [Congress'] power to define the quality and force of those notes as currency is as broad as 24 the like power over a metallic currency under the power to coin money and to regulate the value thereof. Under 25 the two powers, taken together, Congress is authorized to establish a national currency, either in coin or in 26 paper, and to make that currency lawful money for all pu rposes, as regards the national government or private 27 individuals. . . . (Emphasis added)” 28 Here is what one federal court said when one American claimed his FRN’s were not lawful money and that they were 29 exempt from taxation by a state. It’s all B.S., of course: 30 “Congress has delegated the power to establish this national currency which is lawful money to the Federal 31 Reserve System. 12 U.S.C. §411 . Congress has made the Federal Reserve note the measure of value in our 32 monetary system, 12 U.S.C. § 412 (1968) , *fn1 and has defined Federal Reserve notes as legal tender for taxes, 33 31 U.S.C. §392 (1965) . Taxpayers' attempt to devalue the Federal Reserve notes they received as income is, 34 therefore, not lawful under the laws of the United States.” 35 [Mathes v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 576 F.2d 70 (1978 )] 36 Obviously, Mr. Mathes didn’t explain his case properly. If he had stuck to the statutory definition of a “dollar” and 37 demanded that a statute be produced describing WHICH of the two “dollars” they are talking about, the court would have 38 been powerless, because “there ain’t no friggin statute”, as confirmed by correspondence from the Federal Reserve Board 39 itself!

The following provision requires that earnings of an 44 “employee” as legally defined are not “wages” if the employee is not engaged in a “trade or business” and the 45 “employee’s” remuneration was paid in any med ium OTHER than “cash”: 46 United States Code 47 TITLE 26 - INTERNAL REVENUE CODE 48 SUBTITLE C - EMPLOYMENT TAXES 49 CHAPTER 24 - COLLECTION OF INCOME TAX AT SOURCE ON WAGES 50 Section 3401.

The “law” pursuant to HJR -192 set asid e or “suspended” the common law in 10 regard to payments of contracts in money, or as it might be said in another way, HJR -192 was very much a banker’s delight 11 because it effectuated a suspension of redemption of all of the outstanding circulating notes as we ll as a newly created 12 “legal” ability to “negotiate” checks and other money denominated securities without having to pay out lawful money, 13 meaning gold or silver coins. Instead the Banks could discharge their fiduciary duty by offering, that is “tendering” 14 anything that was legal tender at that time. (All of the above will be found in HJR -192, Section 1. 15 As a point of emphasis here, HJR -192 found at 48 Stat. 112- 113 did not by express terms repeal any of the pre -existing 16 common law remedies. At the most, all it did was indirectly suspend any ability to use the common law remedies for a 17 while. 18 The while, as it turns out, last ed from 1933 to 1982, or almost 50 years. But upon the repeal of HJR -192 all of the older 19 common law remedies became available for use again and the Banks could not “legally” evade their fiduciary duty to pay 20 in lawful money. But they do and have continued to avoid their duty it seems simply because no one has demanded that a 21 Bank should pay in dollars of lawful money and has stood firm in refusing to accept those Federal Reserve notes when 22 tendered. 23 You can refuse them now that HJR -192 has been repealed and when you do the Bank is put into a very difficult spot. 24 Lawfully, a Bank must pay in lawful money dollars and it is very likely that the Bank simply does not have any, or maybe 25 not enough to transact your check. That tells you that the Bank is insolvent, A.K.A. bankrupt. 26 There is today a parity relationship between FRn’s and the lawful money silver dollars which is about 10 to 1 and moving 27 upward to 12 to 1. Under the 10:1 parity a single or 1 “dollar” Federal Reserve note is actually worth only ten cents in 28 silver coin lawful money. Go to a coin store and buy one silver dollar coin using FRn’s. You’ll learn about parity values. 29 11 Evils of a corrupted monetary system 30 A paper money system allows those holding the reigns of power of that system to essentially fleece the economy for their 31 own benefit. Such a “political” monetary system impedes economic growth, increases private and govt debt, aggregates 32 political and economic power in the hands of an elitist few, among many other social detriments. In contrast, a specie 33 monetary system allows the populace to hold wealth in their own hands and a specie system cannot be manipulated as can a 34 paper money system. Real economic growth at faster rates would occur with a specie monetary system. It is paper money 35 and not specie money that causes problems and retards growth of the economy. 36 Imagine what our economy would be like if, since the war between the States, we had a specie monetary system instead of 37 a paper one. We would not have had the economic “drag” on the economy caused by a paper system. We would not have 38 suffered from the “whipsaw” recessions and expansions created by a paper system. Real economic growth far greater than 39 we have seen would have been achieved. We would have had fewer wars, steady economi c growth, far smaller govt, steady 40 prices (if not declining prices), etc. 41 The reason we have a paper money system is because it allows a few men to operate a giant Ponzi scheme at tremendous 42 costs to the rest of us. Men like the Treasury Secretary, can make tens and hundreds of millions “bux” a year. And then 43 they can become Treasury Secretary, and make decisions that help their friends (JP Morgan vs Bear Stearns). 44"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":" The Money Scam 80 of 120 Copyright Sovereignty Education and Defense Ministry, http://sedm.org Form 05.041, Rev. 10- 18- 200 9 EXHIBIT:________ 11.1 Historical perspective 1 History shows that the U.S. economy greatly improved when paper money (“bills of credit”) was banished by the monetary 2 provisions of the U.S. Constitution .

Specie money and pa per currencies have always been at war with each other. The advantages 8 of operating a paper currency system accrue solely to those operating this system, the “elites”. Those who operate such a 9 system can expand and contract the supply of currency at will, thus allowing those operators to aggregate assets in their 10 own hands. Lots of people think there is an event known as the business cycle, but they are wrong; it is really a banking 11 cycle. 12 An example of the harm caused by paper money is seen when you simply study the events leading up to WWI and 13 afterwards. The U.S. was “lucky” to have the Fed Reserve created in 1913, just a few years before the War. The Fed then 14 financed much of the cost of the war, and after it, deliberately contracted the money supply.

Each of these coins are minted with a face value that is als o 18 “legal tender”. For instance, you can presently buy a one ounce Gold Eagle for 976.61 Federal Reserve Notes as of the 19 time of this writing on 4/12/2008.

Yes Yes No. Current notes fraudulently indicate otherwise What’s wrong with th e above situation? Here are a few inequities: 11 1. How can you lawfully use Federal Reserve Notes or U.S. Mint numismatic “dollars” to pay debts without helping 12 Congress commit TREASON punishable by death under the original United States of America Money Act, 1 Stat. 13 246? That act has NEVER been repealed. The U.S. Mint numismatic dollars violate said act because their face value 14 is not proportional to the gold content and therefore this is a “debasement of the coin” punishable by death under said 15 act. 16 2. Which o ne do we pay taxes against? What if our business associates pay us in gold coins ? Do we declare our income 17 based on the face value or the Federal Reserve Note value? 18 3. What statute dictates that taxes are to be paid in Federal Reserve Note value? We’ll gi ve you a hint: There ain’t none ! 19 4. If there is no statute dictating that taxes are to be paid in Federal Reserve Note value, then how can a judge decide 20 without a statute? Judges aren’t allowed to MAKE law or legislate from the bench. The Constitution res erves the 21 power to make law and create such obligations ONLY to Congress. Any deviation from this separation of powers is 22 TREASON and amounts to allowing judges to entertain “political questions”, which is forbidden. 23 5. Congress has no legislative jurisdicti on inside a state of the Union to collect income taxes. How can it pass a statute 24 defining the value of a “dollar” for the purposes of taxation without exceeding its authority there? 25 “It is no longer open to question that the general government, unlike the states , Hammer v.

He correctly points out that the value of the coins must be proportional to their weight and they in fact are 11 not, leading to unjust and unequal weights and measures. 12 The replies you received to your query from both John Ensign's office and the Treasury Department reveal just 13 how confused this situation is. Being a man who considers his word his bond, I would have to say that the FRN 14 is and remains a contract ; whether or not the government chooses to admit this . . .they printed the things. At 15 the top of the contract they proudly proclaim it to be a Federal Reserve Note. At the bottom they declare the 16 value, as in the dollar bill as One Dollar. The value of goods or services the note may purchase has changed, 17 albeit not for the better. However, if you hold a 1900 $20 gold piece, you can still purchase what that coin 18 could buy when it was minted. 19 The situation with coinage is more complex, but equally (if not more) confusing . The United States Code 20 provides for three different types of coinage denominated in \"dollars\" : namely, base- metallic coinage, gold 21 coinage, and silver coinage . 22 The base -metallic coinage consists of \"a dollar coin,\" weighing \"8 .1 grams,\" \"a half dollar coin,\" weighing \"11 23 .34 grams\" ; \"a quarter coin,\" weighing \"5 .67 grams\" : and \"a dime coin,\" weighing \"2 .268 grams.\" All of 24 these coins are composed of copper and nickel. The weights of the dime, the q uarter, and the half dollar are in 25 the correct arithmetical proportions, the one to each of the others . But the \"dollar\" is disproportionately light 26 (or the other coins disproportionately heavy) . In this series of base metallic coins, then, the questions 27 naturally arise : Is the \"dollar\" a cupro -nickel coin weighing \"8.1 grams\"? Or is it two cupro - nickel coins 28 (or four or ten coins) collectively weighing 22.68 grams? Or is it both? Or is it neither, but something else 29 altogether, to which the weights of these coins are irrelevant? 30 Similarly, the gold coinage consists of \"a fifty dollar gold coin\" that \"weighs 33 .931 grams, and contains one 31 troy ounce of fine gold\"; \"a twenty- five dollar gold coin\" that \"contains one -half ounce of fine gold\" ; \"a ten 32 doll ar gold coin\" that \"contains one fourth ounce of fine gold\"; and \"a five dollar gold coin\" that \"contains one 33 tenth ounce of fine gold.\" The \"fifty dollar,\" \"twenty- five dollar,\" and \"five dollar\" coins are in the correct 34 arithmetical proportions each to the others. But the \"ten dollar\" coin is not. Therefore, is a \"dollar\" one- 35 fiftieth or one- fortieth of an ounce of gold? It appears to be undecided . 36 I would have to say that, based on the oath I took when I assumed this office ; the US Government has not 37 upheld its part on a contract begun back when it first began printing monetary notes . We still trade the notes 38 for goods and services, but the trust is no longer there. 39 [Congressman Bob Beers of the Nevada Assembly, Letter Dated 1/14/2008 ; See Section 16.7 ] 40 The other inequity pointed out by Congressman D ean Heller later in section 16.8 is that there is no fixed or legal 41 relationship between the legal tender or “face value” of silver coins and the equivalent “dollars” in Federal Reserve Notes, 42 leading to unjust and unequal weights and measures: 43 To begin with, I apologize for the confusion my previous letter caused . To clarify, 31 U.S .C. 5116(b)(2) does in 44 fact address the sale of silver and not the dollar . As you pointed out, 31 U.S.C. § 5112(e) contains the most 45 accurate definition of a dollar coin . which by statute mus t contain .999 ounce fine silver. 46 However, as we both know, paper dollars are used much more frequently in circulation, and the U.S. Code does 47 not contain a specific definition of a dollar bill . According to 31 U.S.C. 5115(a)(2) , the Treasury is authorized 48 to print currency notes of \"at least one dollar .\" No law mandates use of the dollar bill, but clearly it has been a 49 more convenient mode of legal tender for Americans in recent decades . A s you are likely aware, the Coinage 50 Act of 1965, which modified 31 U.S.C. 5103, states : \"United States coins and currency (including federal 51"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":" The Money Scam 83 of 120 Copyright Sovereignty Education and Defense Ministry, http://sedm.org Form 05.041, Rev. 10- 18- 200 9 EXHIBIT:________ reserve notes) are legal tender for all debts, public charges, taxes, and dues .\" Wheth er individuals utilize coins 1 or paper currency is a matter of personal choice . Similarly, no federal statute mandates that a private business, 2 a person or an organization must accept currency or coins as for payment for goods or services . Private 3 busines ses are free to develop their own policies on whether or not to accept cash unless state law says 4 otherwise. 5 [Letter from Congressman Dean Heller dated July 11, 2007 ; Section 16.8 later] 6 To make things wors e, no less than the Federal Reserve Board itself admits that there is no legal definition or fixed 7 definition of the word “dollar” . Furthermore, they also admit that Federal Reserve Notes are NOT “dollars”! See section 8 16.6 later. All of this confusion results in unjust weights and measures, which t he Bible condemns as abominable: 9 “Diverse weights and diverse measures, 10 They are both alike, an abomination to the LORD.” 11 [Prov. 20:10, Bible, NKJV] 12 “Dishonest scales are an abomination to the LORD, 13 But a just weight is His delight. ” 14 [Prov. 11:1 , Bible, NKJV] 15 Aside from all the above, there are other much worse problems with our present fiat monetary system of Federal Reserve 16 Notes: 17 1. It is very dangerous to place in the hands of our rulers the ability to create money backed by nothing. Such a 18 predicament is “rife with moral hazards”. These moral hazards are exemplified by the following questions: 19 1.1. “If I gave you the ability to create money out of nothing, could or would you restrain yourself in printing endless 20 quantities of it?” 21 1.2. “Who can restrain the politicians in printing unlimited quantities of fiat currency and how can such a power 22 lawfully be restrained?” 23 2. As we point out, Federal Reserve Notes are FRAUDULENT because they are not authorized anywhere in any currently 24 enacted positive law statute to be used as legal tender for PRIVATE debts, or for ALL debtus, both public and private. 25 3. Since the Federal Reserve Notes are backed by absolutely nothing , the ir value is deter mined solely by their supply. 26 4. The U.S. government can print as much as they want at very little cost or expense, and thereby effectively STEAL 27 from those already holding the notes by diluting the value of the notes in circulation . 28 5. A debt -based currency sys tem punishes savers and rewards borrowers. Those who save are punished by inflating away 29 the value of their savings. Those who borrow have to pay back less in real terms over time than they borrowed because 30 of inflation. This: 31 5.1. Prevents the capital forma tion that is the heart of any productive economy. 32 5.2. Causes countries who adopt it and who have trade deficits to eventually to have to seek lenders from outside their 33 borders, making them economic slaves to foreign countries. 34 6. It is illegal to counterfeit and those who do it go to federal prison . 18 U.S.C. §471 . However, every time the 35 government prints more fiat currency , they are counterfeiting. This violates the principle of equal protection and equal 36 tr eatment under the law. 37 7. What the U.S. government has done is effectively made the illegal act of counterfeiting into a franchise called the 38 Federal Reserve, and reserved to itself the ONLY authority to commit this illegal act. 12 U.S.C. §83(a) mandates that 39 member banks within the Federal Reserve system are prohibited from loaning their own money. Thus, our government 40 has: 41 7.1. Created an unconstitutional “Title of Nobility” for itself in violation of Article 1, Section 9, Clause 8 of the 42 United States Constitution . 43 7.2. Granted itself a monopoly as the only entity that can loan REAL money. 12 U.S.C. §83(a) PROHIBITS banks 44 from l oaning their own money. ALL of their money must come from the government. 45 8. Banks who want to participate in the Federal Reserve counterfeiting franchise must agree to become “national banks” 46 within the meaning of Acts of Congress. This: 47 8.1. Subjects member banks to federal supervision and thereby destroys the separation of powers between what is 48 private and what is public. 49 8.2. Makes member banks into agents of the United States Government. See 31 CFR §202.2 . 50 8.3. Allows Congress to pass laws and policies that force depositors under the color of law essentially to become 51 statutory “U.S. persons” (26 U.S.C. §7701(a)(30)) and statutory “U.S. citizens” (8 U.S.C. §1401 ) in order to use 52 their serv ices . This causes the bank system to become a franchise that : 53 8.3.1. Rec ruits new federal “employees” and “public officers”. 54"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":" The Money Scam 84 of 120 Copyright Sovereignty Education and Defense Ministry, http://sedm.org Form 05.041, Rev. 10- 18- 200 9 EXHIBIT:________ 8.3.2.

Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 58 25 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188, 114 A.L.R. 1487, does not apply to this action. The rights and duties of the United 26 States on commercial paper which it issues are governed by federal rather than local law. When the United 27 States disburses its funds or pays its debts, it is exercising a constitutional function or power . This check was 28 issued for services performed under the Federal Emergency Relief Act of 1935, 49 Stat. 115, 15 U.S.C.A. ss 29 721 -728 . The authority to issue the check had its origin in the Constitution and the statutes of the United States 30 and was in no way dependent on the laws of Pennsylvania or of any other state. Cf. Board of Commissioners v. 31 United States, 308 U.S. 343, 60 S.Ct. 285, 84 L.Ed. 313; Royal Indemnity Co. v. United States, 313 U.S. 289, 61 32 S.Ct. 995, 85 L.Ed. 1361. The duties imposed upon the United States and the rights acquired by it as a result of 33 the issuance find their roots in the same federal sources. FN2 Cf. Deitrick v. Greaney, 309 U.S. 190, 60 S.Ct. 480, 34 84 L.Ed. 694; *367 D'Oench, Duhme & Co. v. Federal Deposit Ins. Corp., 315 U.S. 447, 62 S.Ct. 676, 86 L.Ed. 35 956. In absence of an applicable Act of Congress it is for the federal courts to fashion the governing rule of law 36 according to their own standards. United States v. Guaranty Trust Co., 293 U.S. 340, 55 S.Ct. 221, 79 L.Ed. 37 415, 95 A.L.R. 651, is not opposed to this result. That case was concerned with a conflict of laws rule as to the 38 title acquired by a transferee in Yugoslavia under a forged endorsement. Since the payee's address was 39 Yugoslavia, the check had ‘something of the quality of a foreign bill’ and the law of Yugoslavia was applied to 40 determine what title the transferee acquired. 41 FN2 Various Treasury Regulations govern the payment and endor sement of government checks and warrants 42 and the reimbursement of the Treasurer of the United States by Federal Reserve banks and member bank 43 depositories on payment of checks or warrants bearing a forged endorsement. See 31 Code of Federal 44 Regulations ss 202.0, 202.32- 202.34. Forgery of the check was an offense against the United States. Criminal 45 Code s 148, 18 U.S.C. s 262, 18 U.S.C.A. s 262. 46 In our choice of the applicable federal rule we have occasionally selected state law. See Royal Indemnity Co. 47 v. United States, supra. But reasons which may make state law at times the appropriate federal rule are 48 singularly inappropriate here. The issuance of commercial paper by the United States is on a vast scale and 49 transactions in that paper from issuance to payment will commonly occur in several states. The application 50"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":" The Money Scam 85 of 120 Copyright Sovereignty Education and Defense Ministry, http://sedm.org Form 05.041, Rev. 10- 18- 200 9 EXHIBIT:________ of state law, even without the conflict of laws rules of the forum, would subject the rights and duties of the 1 United States to exceptional uncertainty. It would lead to great diversity in results by making identical 2 transactions subject to the vagaries of the laws of the several states. T he desirability of a uniform rule is 3 plain. And while the federal law merchant developed for about a century under the regime of Swift v. Tyson, 4 16 Pet. 1, 10 L.Ed. 865, represented general commercial law rather than a choice of a federal rule designed 5 to protect a federal right, it nevertheless stands as a convenient source of reference for fashioning federal 6 rules applicable to these federal questions. 7 United States v. National Exchange Bank, 214 U.S. 302, 29 S.Ct. 665, 53 L.Ed. 1006, 16 Ann.Cas. 1184, falls in 8 that category. The Court held that th e United *368 States could recover as drawee from one who presented for 9 payment a pension check on which the name of the payee had been forged, in spite of a protracted delay on the 10 part of the United States in giving notice of the forgery. The Court follo wed Leather Mfrs.' Bank v. Merchants 11 Bank, 128 U.S. 26, 9 S.Ct. 3, 32 L.Ed. 342, which held that the right of the drawee against one who pres ented a 12 check with a forged endorsement of the payee's name accrued at the date of payment and was not dependent on 13 notice or demand. The theory of the National Exchange Bank case is that the who presents a check for payment 14 warrants that he has title to it and the right to receive payment. FN3 If he has acquired**576 the check through a 15 forged endorsement, the warranty is breached at the time the check is cashed. See Manufacturers' Trust Co. v. 16 Harriman Nat. Bank Trust Co., 146 Misc. 551, 262 N.Y.S. 482; Bergman v. Avenue State Bank, 284 Ill.App. 17 516, 1 N.E.2d 432. The theory of the warranty has been challenged. Ames, The Doctrine of Price v. Neal, 4 18 Harv.L.Rev., 297, 301 -302. It has been urged that ‘the right to recover is a quasi contractual right, resting 19 upon the doctrine that one who confers a benefit in misreliance upon a right or duty is entitled to restitution.’ 20 Woodward, Quasi Contracts (1913) s 80; First Nat. Bank v. City Nat. Bank, 182 Mass. 130, 134, 65 N.E. 24, 21 94 Am.St.Rep. 637. But whatever theory is taken, we adhere to the conclusion of the National Exchange Bank 22 case that the drawee's right to recover accrues when the payment is *369 made. There is no other barrier to the 23 maintenance of the cause of action. The theory of the drawee's responsibility where the drawer's signature is 24 forged (Price v. Neale, 3 Burr. 1354; United States v. Chase Nat. Bank, 252 U.S. 485, 40 S.Ct. 361, 64 L.Ed. 25 675, 10 A.L.R. 1401) is inapplicable here. The drawee, whether it be the United States or another, is not 26 chargeable with the knowledge of the signature of the payee. United States v. National Exchange Bank, supra, 27 214 U.S. at page 317, 29 S.Ct. at page 669, 53 L.Ed. 1006, 16 Ann.Cas. 1184; State v. Broadway Nat. Bank, 28 153 Tenn. 113, 282 S.W. 194 . 29 FN3 We need not determine whether the guarantee of prior endorsements adds to the drawee's rights. See 30 Brannan's Negotiable Instruments Law (6th ed.) pp. 330- 331, 816- 817 ; First Nat. Bank v. City Nat. Bank, 182 31 Mass. 130, 134, 65 N.E. 24, 94 Am.St.Rep. 637. Cf. Home Ins. Co. v. Mercantile Trust Co., 219 Mo.App. 645, 32 284 S.W. 834. Under the theory of the National Exchange Bank case, the warranty of the title of him who 33 presents the check for payment would be implied in any event. See Philadelphia Nat. Bank v. Fulton Nat. Bank, 34 D.C., 25 F.2d 995, 997 . 35 The National Exchange Bank case went no further than to hold that prompt notice of the discovery of the 36 forgery was not a condition precedent to suit. It did not reach the question whether lack of prompt notice might 37 be a defense. We think it may. If it is shown that the drawee on learning of the forgery did not give prompt 38 notice of it and that damage resulted, recovery by the drawee is barred. See Ladd & Tilton Bank v. United 39 States, 9 Cir., 30 F.2d 334; United States v. National Rockland Bank, D.C., 35 F.Supp. 912; United States v. 40 National City Bank, D.C., 28 F.Supp. 144. The fact that the drawee is the United States and the laches those 41 of its employees are not material. Cooke v. United States, 91 U.S. 389, 398, 23 L.Ed. 237. The United States 42 as drawee of commercial paper stands in no different light than any other drawee. As stated in United States 43 v. National Exchange Bank, 270 U.S. 527, 534, 46 S.Ct. 388, 389, 70 L.Ed. 717, ‘The United States does 44 business on business terms.’ It is not excepted from the general rules governing the rights and duties of 45 drawees ‘by the largeness of its dealings and its having to employ agents to do what if done by a principal in 46 person would leave no room for doubt.’ Id., 270 U.S. at page 535, 46 S.Ct. at page 389, 70 L.Ed. 717. But the 47 damage occasioned by the delay must be established and not left to conjecture. Cases such as Market St. Title 48 & Trust Co. v. Chelten Trust Co., s upra, place the burden on the drawee of giving prompt notice of the forgery - 49 injury to the defendant being presumed by the mere fact of delay. See London & River Plate *370 Bk. v. Bank of 50 Liverpool, (1896) 1 Q.B. 7. But we do not think that he who accepts a forged signature of a payee deserves that 51 preferred treatment. It is his neglect or error in accepting the forger's signature which occasions the loss. See 52 Bank of Commerce v. Union Bank, 3 N.Y. 230, 236. He should be allowed to shift that loss to the drawee only 53 on a clear showing that the drawee's delay in notifying him of the forgery caused him damage. See Woodward, 54 Quasi Contracts (1913) s 25. No such damage has been shown by Clearfield Trust Co. who so far as appears 55 can still recover from J. C. Penney Co. The only showing on the part of the latter is contained in the stipulation 56 to the effect that if a check cashed for a customer is returned unpa id or for reclamation a short time after the 57 date on which it is cashed, the employees can often locate the person who cashed it. It is further stipulated that 58 when J. C. Penney Co. was notified of the forgery in the present case none of **577 its employees was able to 59 remember anything about the transaction or check in question. The inference is that the more prompt the notice 60 the more likely the detection of the forger. But that falls short of a showing that the delay caused a manifest 61 loss. Third Nat. Bank v. Merchants' Nat. Bank, 76 Hun 475, 27 N.Y.S. 1070. It is but another way of saying that 62 mere delay is enough. 63 [Clearfield Trust Co. v.

Thei r use in private industry is 1 voluntary but cannot be mandated, since current law at 12 U.S.C. §411 describes them as “obligations of the United States” 2 and does not make them “money ” for private purposes. Even the U.S. Treasury w ebsite admits that Federal Reserve Notes 3 are not legal tender for private purposes: 4 FAQs: Currency 5 Legal Tender Status 6 I thought that United States currency was legal tender for all debts. Some businesses or 7 governmental agencies say that they will only accept checks, money orders or credit cards as payment, and others will only 8 accept currency notes in denominations of $20 or smaller. Isn't this illegal? 9 The pertinent portion of law that applies to your question is the Coinage Act of 1965 , specifically Section 31 10 U.S.C. 5103, entitled \"Legal tender,\" which states: \"United States coins and currency (including Federal reserve notes and circulating 11 notes of Federal reserve banks and national banks) are legal tender for all debts, public charges, taxes, and dues.\" 12 This statute means that all United States money as identified above are a valid and legal offer of payment for debts when tendered to a 13 creditor. There is, however, no Federal statute mandating that a private business, a person or an organization must accept 14 currency or coins as for payment for goods and/or services. Private businesses are free to develop their own policies on 15 whether or not to accept cash unless there is a State law which says otherwise. For example, a bus line may prohibit payment 16 of fares in pennies or dollar bills. In addition, movie theaters, con venience stores and gas stations may refuse to accept large 17 denomination currency (usually notes above $20) as a matter of policy. 18 [SOURCE : Legal Tender Status, United States Dept. of Treasury Website ; 19 http://www.ustreas.gov/education/faq/currency/legal -tender.shtml 20 Federal Reserve Notes are promissory notes , not unlike the commercial paper described in the above Clearfield case. That 21 is how they are described in the Legal Tender Cases: 22 “It must be evident, however, upon reflection that, if there were any power in the government of the United 23 States to impart the quality of legal tender to its promissory notes, it was for congress to determine when the 24 necessity for its exercise existed ; that war merely increased the urgency for money; it did not add to the powers 25 of the government nor change their nature; that if the power existed it might be equally exercised when a loan 26 was made to meet ordinary expenses in time of peace, as when vast sums were needed to support an army or a 27 navy in time of war. The wants of the government could never be the measure of its powers. But in the 28 excitement and apprehensions of the war these considerations were unheeded; the measure was passed as one 29 of overruling *458 necessity in a perilous crisis of the country. ” 30 [Legal Tender Cases, 110 U.S. 421, 457- 458 (1884) ] 31 Below is the definition of “promissory note”: 32 “ Promissory note . A promise or engagement, in writing, to pay a specified sum at a time therein stated, or on 33 demand, or at sight, to a person therein named, or to his order, or bearer. An unconditional written promise, 34 signed by the maker, to pay absolutely and at all events a sum certain in money, either to the bearer or to a 35 person therein designated or to his order, at a time specified therein, or at a time which must certainly arrive. 36 A signed paper promising to pay another a certain sum of money. A n unconditional written promise to pay a 37 specified sum of money on demand or at a specified date. Such a note is negotiabel if signed by the maker and 38 containing an unconditional promise to pay a sum certain in money either on demand or at a definite time and 39 payable to order or bearer.

As such, when the government uses them, they surrender sovereign immunity and 4 go down to the ordinary level of a private citizen and not a government. The U.S. Supreme Court affirmed this conclusion 5 when it held the following: 6 Moreover, if the dissent were correct that the sovereign acts doctrine permits the Government to abrogate its 7 contractual commitments in \"regulatory\" cases even where it simply sought to avoid contracts it had come to 8 regret, then the Government's sovereign contracting power would be of very little use in this broad sphere of 9 public activity. We rejected a virtually identical argument in Perry v. United States, 294 U.S. 330 (1935) , in 10 which Congress had passed a resolution regulating the payment of obligations in gold. We held that the law 11 could not be applied to the Government's own obligations, noting that \"the right to make binding obligations 12 is a competence attaching to sovereignty. \" Id. at 353. 13 See also Clearfield Trust C o. v.

The dissent ignores these sta tements (including the statement from Jones, from which case Horowitz 29 drew its reasoning literally verbatim), when it says, post at 931, that the sovereign acts cases do not emphasize 30 the need to treat the government- as-contractor the same as a private par ty. 31 Our Contract Clause cases have demonstrated a similar concern with governmental self- interest by recognizing 32 that \"complete deference to a legislative assessment of reasonableness and necessity is not appropriate because 33 the State's self- interest is at stake.\" United States Trust Co. of N.Y. v.

It has been only recently that the case for the gold standard has begun to surface from under the 1 Policy Makers' anti -gold debris. Consequently, gold is once again gaining the attention and interest it so rightly deserves. 2 Today's free -market advocates of the gold standard differ from past advocates. For example, free -market advocates do not 3 exclude silver or other commodities from their concept of a gold standard. Indeed, they do not even insist that gold must be 4 money. The case for the gold standard is actually the case for market -originated commodity money, and the case ag ainst 5 government -regulated fiat money. It is simply an extension of the case for free markets which respect the rights of man, and 6 the case against controlled markets which violate the rights of man. 7 To be concerned with the gold standard is to be concerned with a free economy, regulated by the values and choices of 8 men, rather than a controlled economy in which the values and choices of men are regulated by government. This concern 9 for man's freedom to express values and exercise choices is derived from t he deeper concern for justice and for man's right 10 to property. The man concerned with justice does not aim to force others to use gold as money. Rather, he insists that 11 government has no right to prevent him and other men from using gold as money if they c hoose. The man concerned with 12 property rights does not urge government to legislate pro- gold policies in order to arbitrarily increase the value, popularity, 13 or status of gold. Rather, he insists that government stop inflating, since this arbitrarily decre ases the value of his money 14 claims to property. 15 Antagonists of the gold standard claim that it is impractical. But the gold standard is, in fact, the most practical monetary 16 system yet conceived by man. However, the gold standard's primary virtue does not lie in its practicality: it lies in its 17 morality. Those concerned about such things as freedom, justice, the preservation of property rights and purchasing power, 18 would do well to consider the moral case for the gold standard, for, once understood, it is the individual's best defense 19 against government confiscation of property through inflation. 20 The fact that prevents government from indulging in inflationary schemes under the gold standard can be best summed up 21 in a phrase: governments can't print gold. But to understand the implications of this statement, and the virtues of having 22 gold as money, it is first necessary to understand what money is — and what money is not. 23 12.1 What Money Is . . . 24 A man on a desert island has no need for money. He produces the goods he needs to survive, and consumes all he produces. 25 Similarly, a primitive society has no need for money. The kinds of goods produced are extremely limited, and if individuals 26 desire to exchange their goods with one another, they can do so through dir ect exchange, i.e., barter. But under a division of 27 labor economy where men specialize in production and where there is a variety of goods produced, desired, and traded, 28 there is a very definite need for money. For how else could Mr. Jones in Florida sell his oranges to men throughout the 29 world and then buy Mr. Smith's best- selling novel, unless there existed some medium of exchange acceptable to all parties. 30 Money originates from men's desire for indirect exchange. And more, since indirect exchange usuall y occurs between 31 strangers like Smith and Jones, money must be an object which is mutually valued. Thus, money is that commodity which 32 serves as a medium of exchange by virtue of its high degree of marketability. 33 The task of discovering which commodity will be most valued by and most acceptable to men as a medium of exchange can 34 only be accomplished through a market process; for it is only through the market that men's values and choices are properly 35 reflected. The verdict of the market has reflected three general requirements for any lasting medium of exchange: that 36 money should be generally acceptable to most men; that it should be practical to use; and that it should be relatively stable 37 in value. If these requirements are satisfied, the result is a money of trust. 38 Trust is the lifeblood of money, and money is the lifeblood of any economy based on the indirect exchange of goods and 39 services. A money of trust serves to facilitate exchange among men, and in doing so, breeds a healthy and growing 40 economy. B ut if men should ever begin to mistrust money, the market will immediately reflect this loss of confidence. Then 41 money will begin to lose stability, lose its acceptability, and will soon become impractical to use in exchange. 42 Mistrusted money is the antit hesis of the lifeblood of an economy. It's a kind of \"bad blood\" circulating between men 43 throughout the economy, breeding confusion and suspicion. The fact that men's mistrust of money will result in monetary 44 crises and collapse, underscores the need for a money that never contradicts men's values, a money that at all times properly 45"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":" The Money Scam 89 of 120 Copyright Sovereignty Education and Defense Ministry, http://sedm.org Form 05.041, Rev. 10- 18- 200 9 EXHIBIT:________ reflects men's values, i.e., a money based on, and constantly exposed to, individual choices — which means a free- market - 1 originated commodity money. 2 When one considers the complex process that must take place before men can discover which commodity money constantly 3 reflects their changing values and choices, one can understand why it is only through a free market process that money can 4 properly evolve as a medium of trust. And one may also understand why no man, group of men, or government, has the 5 right to dictate what money or its value should be. This decision must be a market decision if it is to be a lasting decision. 6 Throughout history, almost every conceivable commodity has been used as a medium of exchange. Through the years of 7 economic development and through trial and error, those commodities least suited to serve as money were eliminated, while 8 those commodities best suited survived as forms of money. After centuries of exchange between men, the commodity that 9 emerged as the most valued, the most practical, the most trusted money among men, was gold. 10 What gives rise to men's trust in gold? First, men value gold as money because men value gold as a commodity. Gold at an y 11 time can be converted to its commodity role if its monetary role should ever be questioned. Second, since gold is relatively 12 scarce and precious to men, it has stability of value. Therefore, it can be trusted to serve as a relatively stable medium of 13 exchange. And since most individuals desire to save part of what they produce in some monetary form, gold's stability of 14 value provides them with a reliable monetary method of accumulating and storing wealth. 15 What else gives rise to men's trust in gold? Gold is easily marketable, which means it is acceptable to men in exchanges of 16 all kinds. Gold is also trusted because it is practical: it's durable, so it won't perish or rot; it's small in bulk, so it i s easily 17 transportable. It's a metal, which means it can be used in different forms, such as bars or coins; and, since gold does not 18 evaporate, it will lose neither quantity nor quality if or when men should decide to melt their coins into bullion or melt their 19 bullion for use in production. 20 There is one more thing that gives rise to men's trust in gold: the knowledge that gold cannot be counterfeited; the 21 conviction that the money supply cannot be artificially and arbitrarily increased by those who would aim to confiscate 22 wealth rather than produce it; the kno wledge that money (the claim to production and effort) will itself represent production 23 and effort. In short, men's trust in gold carries the conviction that the monetary system freely adopted by men is based, not 24 on whim and decree, but on integrity and p roductivity. 25 These are some of the reasons why men have trusted gold as a medium of exchange through history — and why today's 26 Policy Makers damn its existence. 27 12.2 And What Money Is Not 28 Money is not paper. Paper notes evolve from the desire for a convenient substitute for commodity money. The paper notes 29 that circulate as money today were once money substitutes (receipts for gold), defined by and convertible into a specific 30 amount of gold. Paper notes did not and cannot become a money of trust without first representing a commodity of trust. 31 Consider the reaction of free men — men who, understanding and respecting the meaning of property rights, are suddenly 32 and for the first time offered in place of gold, non- convertible paper notes. These notes would be m eaningless to such men. 33 No man who had just come from harvesting a field of wheat would even consider trading his wheat for scrap paper. 34 There are only two ways in which men will accept paper notes without commodity convertibility : if they are forced to do 35 so, or if they are conned into doing so. Americans are now legally forced to accept government's non -convertible paper 36 notes — but only because they have been conned into believing that commodity money is \"old -fashioned\" and 37 \"impractical\" and that paper notes are indicative of a \"modern and sophisticated economy.\" 38 Nothing could be further from the truth. Non -convertible paper \"money\" is fiat money that derives its value, not from its 39 value as a commodity, not from its value as a useful medium of exchange according to the requirements of a medium of 40 exchange, but from the decree of government. Fiat money is a throwback to the days of kings and the mentality of dictators. 41 It is not a money evolved from the values and choices of free men in free markets, but a money created through the 42 coercion of government. 43"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":" The Money Scam 90 of 120 Copyright Sovereignty Education and Defense Ministry, http://sedm.org Form 05.041, Rev. 10- 18- 200 9 EXHIBIT:________ Is commodity money old- fashioned and impractical, as today's Policy Makers contend it is? Consider the following facts: 1 Over the last several decades, the exchange ratios (the prices) of various commod ities have not varied much in value 2 relative to each other. For example, the value of eggs to milk or milk to bread would be at approximately the same ratios 3 today as they were years ago. 4 12.3 Why Prices Rise 5 But if it is true that the exchange ratios of comm odities are relatively the same today as they were in the past, why then 6 have prices (the exchange ratios of dollars to goods) soared over the years? The reason is that the value of the paper money, 7 with which government forces everyone to deal, has fallen yearly relative to all commodities. Clearly, if a commodity 8 (theoretically, almost any commodity) had been used as a medium of exchange over the past decades instead of 9 government's fiat money, prices would have remained relatively stable. It is important to realize that it is not commodities 10 that are rising in value, but fiat money that is falling in value. 11 Since 1933, when the U.S. severed the dollar -commodity relationship by abandoning what was left of the gold standard, the 12 value of the dollar has dep reciated by over ninety per cent in relation to other commodities. This could never occur under a 13 commodity standard — only under a government imposed fiat standard. Had the U.S. returned to a dollar based on and 14 convertible into gold instead of severing t he dollar -gold relationship, the supply of dollars over the years would have been 15 limited to, or checked by, the supply of gold. Therefore, the value of the dollar today would have been equal to the value of 16 gold in relation to other commodities. Instead, the U.S. decided to print dollars whenever \"needed\" and to pretend that the 17 dollar was \"as good as gold\" by legally fixing its value. The pretense couldn't last, and today the dollar is worth a mere 18 fraction of its value in terms of gold in 1933. 19 Paper notes that are not representative of and convertible into a commodity are not money and have never satisfied the 20 requirements of money for long. They are notes of circulating debt which men are forced to accept, so that governments can 21 continuously pursue th eir policies of inflation. 22 12.4 The Nature of Inflation 23 Inflation is the fraudulent increase in the supply of money substitutes and credit. It is a policy which allows government to 24 artificially create and spend more money than it is able to collect in taxes or borrow from its citizens. Government is the 25 cause of inflation — the effect is higher prices. 26 Consider each dollar as a claim to some tangible good. If the claims are increased, the value of each claim goes down 27 because there are more dollars seeking g oods. This bids prices up. 28 But inflation is not simply rising prices. In fact, inflation may exist even when prices remain the same or decrease. How is 29 this possible? If the production of goods and services increases more than the artificial increase in p aper claims, prices will 30 drop — but not by as much as they would have, had there been no artificial increase in paper claims. Thus, in real terms, 31 the value of paper claims is effectively reduced even though in relative terms the value of these claims may increase. 32 Historically, and in relatively free market economies, there are only two ways in which a general across -the -board increase 33 in prices can occur: through a dramatic increase in commodity money (such as new gold discoveries) or through a 34 fraudulen t increase of money substitutes by banks and governments. The former type of general price increase rarely occurs 35 and is perfectly natural. The latter is both unnatural and immoral. 36 In the case of new gold production, those who have produced the new commodity money will have earned the right to 37 exchange their product for the products of others. All other non- money producers may have to pay higher prices for goods, 38 as the supply of gold increases, but the higher prices are compensated for by having more money to spend. Who receives 39 the \"new\" money will depend on individual productivity — and this is as it should be, for it is the justice of the market that 40 the acquisition and distribution of wealth is based upon productivity rather than decree. 41 But, given a fiat standard where government sanctions and sponsors an artificial increase in paper money or credit, the 42 increase in purchasing power for some men can only be obtained at the expense of other men. Given a fiat standard, income 43 distribution is the result of chance, caprice, or government favors and loans. When government doles out its fiat money, 44"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":" The Money Scam 91 of 120 Copyright Sovereignty Education and Defense Ministry, http://sedm.org Form 05.041, Rev. 10- 18- 200 9 EXHIBIT:________ these notes dilute the value of all other outstanding money claims. Those who receive the fiat money first, benefit from 1 spending their money before prices rise. But as the fiat money is spent, prices are higher for all other consumers. Thus, the 2 difference between a real increase in the money supply (i.e., commodity money) and an artificial increase (i.e., in paper 3 claims) is the difference between production and theft. 4 Clearly, inflation is a moral issue. However prices respond, it is immoral that some man, agency, or government is legally 5 permitted to obtain wealth at the involuntary expense of other men. The major challenge in the sphere of monetary relations 6 today is how to abolish the coercive power of government to control the supply and regulate the value of money, and how 7 to return this function to the market where it properly belongs. 8 12.5 The Fiat Standard at Work 9 Under a fiat standard, government gains con trol of the banking system and thus, indirectly, of the nation's money supply. It 10 can artificially and arbitrarily create money and furnish credit. Government paper notes are not based on or convertible into 11 gold, or any other tangible commodity; man's pro duction and labor are not the sole claim to other men's production and 12 labor : the supply and value of money are determined by government. 13 Under the American version of the fiat standard, the banking system and the nation's money supply are controlled and 14 regulated for the most part by a twelve -man Board of Governors which is empowered to make policy decisions for the 15 majority of the nation's banks. Thus, America's banking system is not a free and private banking system — it is a quasi - 16 governmental banking system, known as the Federal Reserve System. 17 It should be clear that the Federal Reserve System's power to create claims against individuals' property is immoral. But 18 neither the Federal Reserve System nor the fiat standard is ever defended on moral grou nds; they are defended on practical 19 grounds. Once inspected, however, these grounds turn out to be about as solid as quicksand. The primary justification given 20 for a fiat standard is that credit can be extended far more rapidly and extensively. This, it is claimed, is the fiat standard's 21 major virtue. It is, in fact, a major vice. 22 The greatest economic threat under a fiat standard is that the Federal Reserve System will supply heavy doses of money and 23 credit to the loan market in an attempt to reduce inter est rates and \"stimulate\" the economy. This attempt, while temporarily 24 stimulating economic activity, leads to malinvestment, as businessmen falsely anticipate greater profits. A \"boom\" results, 25 but since the \"boom\" is artificially created, the prosperity is temporary and, for the most part, illusory. Government has not 26 furnished more goods; it has not increased the nation's prosperity; it has simply increased the money supply —which leads 27 men to believe they are richer. The fact is, however, they only have more paper claims to goods. This cannot enrich anyone; 28 it can only lead to future inflation, i.e., a reduction of the value of real claims to wealth. 29 12.6 The Illusion of Prosperity 30 Thus, increases of money and credit provide only an illusion of prosperity, for with increased money and credit come 31 increased costs for producer goods and increased wage costs. Higher wages then lead to over -consumption, as consumers, 32 too, are enticed by the illusion of prosperity. But overconsumption results in higher prices whi ch reduce the consumer's 33 standard of living. Since the \"boom\" was inflation- inspired, producers and consumers are not better off — they are worse 34 off. Mal -investment and over -consumption are mistakes — errors in judgment — caused by government's attempt to con its 35 citizens into believing that profit opportunities are better than they really are. 36 When the credit expansion that stimulated the \"boom\" ends, the mistakes that were made cannot be perpetuated. These 37 mistakes must be liquidated: consumers buy less and begin paying off their unrealistic accumulation of debts. Producers 38 liquidate inventories. Interest rates rise, and unemployment increases as the economy struggles to readjust. The severity of 39 the readjustment depends on the degree and length of gover nment's prior credit expansion and the policies implemented to 40 cope with the adverse effects. Given continual injections of money and credit in the inane attempt to continue the \"boom\" 41 and prevent a necessary recession, hyperinflation will result. Hyperinf lation must lead to monetary chaos as well as 42 economic disaster, i.e., to depression. A major depression is not a necessary result of the fiat standard, but inflation and the 43 \"boom -bust cycle\" are. 44"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":" The Money Scam 92 of 120 Copyright Sovereignty Education and Defense Ministry, http://sedm.org Form 05.041, Rev. 10- 18- 200 9 EXHIBIT:________ The whole purpose of fiat money is to allow government to spend more money than it can raise in direct taxes from its 1 citizens. As a result, the American fiat standard has worked more often as a means of redistributing wealth than a means of 2 stimulating the economy. Government, instead of furnishing money to the loan market in the attempt to continuously 3 reduce interest rates, has created money to finance the \"welfare\" state. When government's fiat money enters the economy 4 in the form of checks for expenditures, rather than through the loan market, the sequence of events and the effects are a 5 little different. 6 Men usually hold their money as savings, but as prices continue to rise over the years of government deficit spending, men 7 realize that the pieces of paper they hold are continuously and progressively depreciating in value — that inflation is 8 becoming a way of life. Once men begin to lose confidence in government's fiat money, it's only a matter of time before the 9 years of simple inflation burst into hyperinflation and monetary collapse. 10 Thus, whether gover nment tries to stimulate the economy or to finance programs that it cannot afford, the fiat standard is 11 self -defeating and counter -productive. The consequences of America's fiat standard have been mild by historical standards: 12 the Great Depression of the ' 30's, an endless series of booms and busts since then, and a depreciation of the dollar by about 13 92 percent. So much for the \"practicality\" of the fiat standard! 14 12.7 The Meaning of the Gold Standard 15 In a free society, no man, group of men, or government has the \"right\" to infringe upon the rights of others. This means that 16 within a free society, the initiation of force is banned. All goals must be attained through persuasion and voluntary 17 cooperation, and no goal may be achieved at the expense of any man — not for the \"good\" of another man, not for the 18 \"good\" of the state, and not for the \"good\" of society. A system of voluntary exchange is a system of laissez- faire 19 capitalism. Under capitalism, man's rights are supreme. They are defended by government — not violated by government. 20 A gold standard is an integral part of a free society; a fiat standard is an integral part of a controlled society. A gold 21 standard cannot exist without the consent of individuals; a fiat standard cannot exist without the initiated force of 22 government. A gold standard is based on voluntary exchange, the recognition of men's values, and respect for private 23 property; a fiat standard is based on compulsory \"exchange,\" the denial of men's values, and the insidious confiscation of 24 private property. 25 Wealth is production, and gold is the equivalent of wealth produced. Because neither wealth nor gold can be created out of 26 nothing, neither wealth nor gold are possible without men of intelligence, men of ability, and men of productivity. Fiat is 27 force and is the equivalent of wealth confiscated. Both fiat and force are the tools of the envious and the cowardly. 28 Where a gold standard is welcomed by the best of men, the fiat standard is welcomed by the worst of men. Where the gold 29 standard deman ds the earned, the fiat standard grants the unearned. Where a gold standard evolves from individual choice, 30 a fiat standard evolves from government edict. Where a gold standard necessitates only that men be left free to act, to 31 choose, and to trade, a fiat standard invites government to control, to regulate, and to dictate men's choices, actions, and the 32 terms of trade. 33 Gold limits the government's power to spend more money than it receives in taxes, and in doing so, gold limits the 34 government's arbitrary power over the economy; gold checks artificial money and credit expansion; it prevents artificial 35 \"booms\" which lead to very real \"busts\"; gold protects individuals from economically unsound government programs; and 36 it protects citizens from the inflationa ry confiscation of private property. Not only is the gold standard the most practical 37 monetary system yet discovered, it is a standard consistent with freedom — yet it is the gold standard that today's Policy 38 Makers either ignore or denounce. 39 12.8 Is a return t o the Gold and/or Silver Standard Realistically Possible? 40 The next question we must deal with would be the following: 41 “Is a return to the gold standard realistically possible?” 42"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":" The Money Scam 93 of 120 Copyright Sovereignty Education and Defense Ministry, http://sedm.org Form 05.041, Rev. 10- 18- 200 9 EXHIBIT:________ To answer this question, we must look at the production, consumption, and suppl y of gold, the supply of money, and the 1 relationship between the two. 2 We must first begin with a collection of recognized statistics about gold, silver, and the money supply.

Percent of currency reserves worldwide that could be backed by all the gold ever produced: 20.62%. 31 According to the World Gold Council, all the governments in the world hold about 30,000 metric tonnes of gold (the USA 32 holding the most, with 8000 metric tonnes ). Only about 163 ,000 tons have been accumulated by everyone worldwide since 33 the dawn of man. 36 Thus our estimate that the Fed and the Treasury have borrowed and or printed enough money in a year 34 to buy all the gold owned by all governments 7 to 14 times over (depending on whose figure you use of the deficit 35 spending), and nearly twice as much gold than is owned by all people and governments combined! 36 According to Jon Nadler of Kitco Precious Metals , who is the premier precious metals dealer in North America, there is 37 enough gold to cover the value of only 0.6% of the world’s fiat currency. Here is what he said, on Nov. 5, 2009: 38 “As stated in these columns many times b efore, the vast majority of those central banks which wanted to offload 39 their gold holdings, - for whatever reason - have already done so. Wise or unwise, ill- timed, or not, symbolic, or 40 not. Some have even floated the idea that the Indian gold purchase is decoy, a ploy to ultimately 'whack' the 41 budding moonshot in gold with. Okay. Sure. And Ben Bernanke regularly sends me Christmas gifts for being a 42 good Jedi apprentice... 43 Way too much is being read into such actions, or the lack thereof, mainly by amateur o bservers who cannot 44 grasp the concept that ALL the gold in the world (163.000 tonnes of it) adds up to 0.6% of total global 45 wealth, and that it is not about to make a comeback as the de facto 'currency' of the realm or peg among the 46 world's central banks.

Why, sure they can. Will there be 1 tectonic shifts that completely reverse the status quo? Nope. 2 Th e gold standard as we knew it, is history, let us face that inescapable fact. And that, is not just Nobel 3 laureate Paul Krugman's take on the matter. None of this, however, should preclude you , and/ or any othe r 4 investor from making it your own 'standard' if that is your preference. For the majority of individuals, the 5 same exact average that the computation of the official sector's average holdings amounts to (roughly 10%) 6 is a perfectly adequate level. Notwith standing Portugal's 90% or Canada's practically zero gold allocation 7 levels. As we said, these are matters of personal preference, and not standards by which to judge other 8 countries, or individuals' allocation decisions. 9 At the end of the day, it has now been more than three years since individuals around the world have surpassed 10 the official sector in terms of the sheer tonnage of holdings. Thus, there is very little to be gained by constantly 11 pointing to this sale or that purchase as a harbinger of...any thing, or a 'vote' on anything. You may rest assured 12 that no change in central bank reserve management policies would come about, even given $5.000 per ounce 13 gold. It simply does not matter. ” 14 [Jon Nadlter, Kitco, Commentary on Nov. 5, 2009; http://www.kitco.com/ind/nadler/nov052009.html ] 15 We conclude this section by stating that : 16 1. If all the gold coins ever produced throughout history were still available today, then their value would be almost four 17 times the total world currency reserves. 18 2. Jon Nadler’s assertion that only 0.6% of the current world currency reserves could be covered by gold seems 19 untrustworthy. 20 3. We could go back on the gold standard for some fractional percentage of the currency in circulation. The fraction 21 currently stands at 20 percent. That fraction would grow if fiat currency were outlawed or gold standard were re- 22 imposed , because it would automatically raise the value of gold to account for inflation, most likely. 23 13 Conclusion and Summary 24 Our present money system is TOTALLY corrupted, unjust, inequitable, and an abomination to the Lord according to the 25 Bible: 26 1. Our m onetary system has transitioned through the following discrete phases of historical evolution: 27 1.1. 1792-1861 : Redeemability of all notes in gold and silver under the United States of America Money Act of 1792. 28 1.2. 1862 -1865 : Redeemability of the “greenback” temporarily suspended during the Civil War by Abraham Lincoln. 29 1.3. 1866 -1932 : Redeemability of all note s in gold and silver. 30 1.4. 1933 -1971 : Redeemability of all notes in silver but not gold. Gold was outlawed in 1933 , but only in the federal 31 zone and not states of the Union . See HJR -192, which only applied to the government and not the pe ople . 32 1.5. 1972 -Present : No redeemability at all. Currency is entirely fiat currency whose value is regulated by the supply. 33 You can read about the above history in: 34 Pieces of Eight , Second Revision, Edwin Viera; ISBN - 10 - 0967175917, 2002 http://www.edwinvieira.com/ 2. The only valid current legal definiti on of a “dollar” is found in the original United States of America Money Act of 35 1792, 1 Stat. 246 -251 . This act has never been repealed or modified and is still in effect today , even t hough it is not 36 enforced . You can read the act in its entirety later in section 16.10 . Th e definition of a lawful dollar is: 37 2.1. 371.25 grains of pure silver. 38 2.2. 0.848 6 ounces of pure silver. 39 2.3. 416 grains of standard silver. 40 3. We curren tly have in this country three mutually exclusive, parallel, and non -overlapping money systems. All three of 41 these systems use the word “dollar” to describe the note or money. 42 3.1. Lawful money minted under the authority of the United States of America Money A ct, 1 Stat. 246 -251 . This 43 money is no longer printed or minted. 44 3.2. Gold and silve r coins issued by the U.S. Mint under the authority of 31 U.S.C. §5112. The se coins are not lawful 45 money because they are not in compliance with the United States of America Money Act, 1 Stat. 246 -251 . 46 3.3. Private scrip issued by the mint and borrowed from Federal Reserve that has never been approved for “private 47 use” and may only be used internally within the U.S. government under the authority of the Federal Reserve Act . 48 4. The value of a “dollar” under each of the above three systems is not consistent or uniform , and therefore an hateful 49 ABOMINATION to God : 50"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":" The Money Scam 97 of 120 Copyright Sovereignty Education and Defense Ministry, http://sedm.org Form 05.041, Rev. 10- 18- 200 9 EXHIBIT:________ “Diverse weights and diverse measures, 1 They are both alike, an abomination to the LORD. ” 2 [Prov. 20:10, Bible, NKJV] 3 4.1. No statute defines the fixed value of a “dollar” within the U.S. Mint coins currently offered. 4 4.2. No statute defines the fixed value of a “dollar” in the Federal Reserve Note fiat system. 5 4.3. No sta tute dictates which of the t hree systems must be used for the purposes of federal or state taxes. The choice 6 is yours . 7 5. Because there is no legal definition for the fixed value of Federal Reserve Notes c urrently in use and no redeemability 8 for anything of value , and because the value of each note is determined exclusively by the supply, then: 9 5.1. Our present fiat money system is unlawful, which simply means “not authorized by law”. 10 Unlawful . That which is contrary to, prohibited, or unauthorized by law . That which is not lawful. The acting 11 contrary to, or in defiance of the law; disobeying or disregarding the law. Term is equivalent to “without 12 excuse or justification .” State v. Noble, 90 N.M. 360, 563 P.2d 1153, 1157. While necessarily not implying the 13 element of criminality, it is broad enough to include it. 14 [Black’s Law Dictionary, Sixth Edition, p. 1536 ] 15 5.2. Our present fiat money system makes “money” into a political and not a legal commodity. In effect, Federal 16 Reserve Notes function as the equivalent of “permission slips” to do something by the government. 17 5.3. Any dispute involving Federal Reserve Notes is a political and not a legal dispute which may only lawfully be 18 resolved by the political and not legal branch of the government, meaning the Executive or Legislative 19 department s. 20 5.4. It is unlawful for de jure state or federal c ourts to entertain legal disputes involving Federal Reserve Notes. If 21 they do, they are unlawfully engaging in “political questions” in violation of the separation of powers that is the 22 heart of the United S tates Constitution. It is illegal because they have no delegated authority to decide either 23 which of the three money systems to use , the value of a Federal Reserve Note, nor may they compel you to 24 consent or choose which of the three money systems to use . See: 25 Political Jurisdiction , Form #05.004 http://sedm.org/Forms/FormIndex.htm 6. The coins currently made av ailable by the U.S. Mint do not comply with the United States of America Money Act of 26 1792 : 27 6.1. A “one dollar” S ilver Eagle, for instance, is worth $1.18 under the original United State s of America Money Act 28 of 1792, 1 Stat. 246- 251 . 29 6.2. The reason U.S. Mint coins do no conform to the USA Money Act is because Congress had to give up its 30 authority to mint lawful currency t o even have a Federal Reserve. 31 6.3. As such, the coins offered by the U.S. Mint at this time are NOT “lawful money” because they don’t comply with 32 the only law currently regulating the value of a “dollar” in silver. 33 7. The only thing that “employers” , meaning inst rumentalities within the U.S. government, can lawfully and truthfully 34 report on IRS Form W -2 as “wages” are amounts received in cash. This means that persons who are paid in gold or 35 silver or another valuable commodity receive no “wages” reportable on IRS form W -2, even if they are “employees” 36 pursuant to 26 U.S.C. §3401(a)(11) . One employer named Robert Kahre did this in Las Vegas, Nevada and was 37 indicted for failing to withhold. The trial occurred in United States District Court in 2007 and the jury acquitted 13 38 people of ALL 160+ counts. Both the IRS, the Treasury, and the media have been conspicuously silent about this 39 victo ry because they are all in bed together and benefit too much from hiding the truth from the American public .

We do not have any lawfully issued money as money is legally defined in the United States Constitution, Article 1, 42 Section 10 . 43 8.1. This state of affairs has existed since the Emergency Banking Reli ef Act of 1933, 48 Stat. 1 was passed on March 44 9, 1933 by TRAITOR and then President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. 45 8.2. This violation of our Con stitution is being perpetuated in the name of an ongoing national emergency under the 46 authority of 12 U.S.C. §95b . 47 8.3. 12 U.S.C. §95b is legislation that unconstitutionally delegates to the President of the U nited States the authority to 48 decree law, and thus it violates the separation of powers doctrine. 49 8.4. Not even a national emergency justifies suspension of any portion of the United States Constitution: 50"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":" The Money Scam 98 of 120 Copyright Sovereignty Education and Defense Ministry, http://sedm.org Form 05.041, Rev. 10- 18- 200 9 EXHIBIT:________ “ No emergency justifies the violation of any of the provisions of the United States Constitution. 37 An 1 emergency, however, while it cannot create power, increase granted power, or remove or diminish the 2 restrictions imposed upon the power granted or reserved, may allow the exercise of power already in existence, 3 but not exercised except during an emergency. 38 4 The circumstances in which the executive branch may exercise extraordinary powers under the Constitution are 5 very narrow. 39 The danger must be immediate and impending, or the necessity urgent for the public service, 6 such as will not admit of delay, and where the action of the civil authority would be too late in providing the 7 means which the occasion calls for. 40 For example, there is no basis in the Constitution for the seizure of steel 8 mills during a wart ime labor dispute, despite the President's claim that the war effort would be crippled if the 9 mills were shut down. 41 ” 10 [16 Am.Jur.2d, Constitutional Law, §52 ] 11 9. No one in the government wants to fix the problems in our money system because: 12 9.1. All those who have tried have become the target of assassination attempts by the money changers, including 13 Andrew Jackson , Abraham Lincoln , Calvin Coolidge , and John F. Kennedy. The plot to kill Jackson failed but it 14 succeeded in the case of Lincoln, Coolidge, and Kenned y. 15 9.2. Abraham Lincoln in his Gettysburg Address intended after the Civil W ar to lift martial law and return to a lawful 16 money system. He was subsequently assassinated. 17 9.3. President Calvin Coolidge refus ed to get the U.S. into World War 1 while the money changers wanted us in the 18 war so they could bankrupt the treasury and initiate the Federal Reserve system . Coolidge mysteriously died of a 19 heart attack and after his vice president took office, we sudden ly entered World War 1 because that vice president 20 was scared he would be next to be assassinated by the money changers. 21 9.4. Government revenues would go down, which would reduce the retirement benefits of all those who benefit from 22 the current system. This c reates a criminal conflict of interest for federal and state judges in violation of 18 23 U.S.C. §208 . 24 10. The money changers in the private, for profit banking cartel called the Federal Reserve expand and perpetuate their 25 power by: 26 10.1. Fomenting war that necessitates the government to go into debt and rely on their services to pay for the 27 manufactured war. 28 10.2. Fund ing both sides of the war to get both sides to implemen t their counterfeiting scheme . 29 11. Only notes which bear the following inscription are lawful money and “legal tender” for ALL purposes . 30 “THIS NOTE IS LEGAL TENDER FOR ALL DEBTS, PUBLIC AND PRIVATE” 31 Not all Federal reserve notes issued, and especially the earl y ones after 1913, have this inscription and therefore are the 32 equivalent of “private scrip” for internal use only within the Federal Reserve System itself and not by the public at 33 large. 34 12. The phrase “PUBLIC AND PRIVATE ” appearing on Federal Reserve Notes currently in circulation is 35 FRAUDULENT and nowhere found in present enacted law relating to the U.S.A.’s mone tar y system. 36 12.1. This phrase is not found in the current authority for creating lawful money , which is 12 U.S.C. §411 found la ter in 37 section 16.3 and Public Law 97 -258, 96 Stat. 877, Section 5103 . 38 12.2.

NO enactment of Congress after HJR -192 on June 5, 1933 mentions the phrase “public and private”, even though 1 all currently issued Federal R eserve Notes have this phrase printed on them . THIS IS A MONUMENTAL 2 FRAUD committed against the American People ! 3 12.4. The U.S. Supreme Court in the Legal Te nder Cases, 110 U.S. 421 (1884) affirmed that Congress has no authority 4 to mandate that obligations of the United States constitut e money for “private purposes” when it held: 5 “The states are prohibited from emitting bills of credit; but congress, which is neither expressly authorized 6 nor expressly forbidden to do so, has, as we have already seen, been held to have the power of emitting bills 7 of credit, and o f making every provision for their circulation as currency, short of giving them the quality of 8 legal tender for private debts , even by those who have denied its authority to give them this quality. ” 9 [Legal Tender Cases, 110 U.S. 421, 447 (1884) , SOURCE: Section 16.9 later] 10 13. The reason Congress won’t enact any portion of the phrase “PUBLIC AND PRIVATE” in the phrase “TH IS NOTE IS 11 LEGAL TENDER FOR ALL DEBTS, PUBLIC AND PRIVATE” into law is because they would have to admit that : 12 13.1. America’s monetary system is ONLY “public”, meaning that everyone who handles or uses the current “legal 13 tender” is an officer of the U.S. governm ent and the Federal Reserve . 14 13.2. You can’t handle this kind of fiat currency without becoming a “public officer” and therefore a “taxpayer” 15 engaged in the “trade or business” franchise. See: 16 The “Trade or Business” Scam , Form #05.001 http://sedm.org/Forms/FormIndex.htm 13.3. There is no such thing as private property when it comes to fiat money. 17 13.4. Everyone who participates in this fictitious and virtual economic system in effect must become surety for the sins 18 of the few who benefit from the Federal Reserve counterfeiting franchise . This is b ecause without becoming 19 surety, it would be impossible to stabil ize the supply of money amidst the band of thieves and liars who pretend 20 to be public servants, and who run the U.S. government. These scoundrels know how to do nothing but borrow 21 and spend . A $ 11+ trillion public debt is proof positive that the scoundre ls serving in the U.S. Congress are not 22 the least bit concerned about balancing annual budgets. 23 13.5. The net result of all the above is that the only thing that regulates the value of our money is your own labor, 24 which has been pledged as surety for public debt . The “taxes” you pay in proportion to the labor you render 25 institute the equivalent of slavery in violation of 18 U.S.C. §1583, 42 U.S.C. §1994 , and the Thirteenth 26 Amendment . It is slavery because there is no other alternative economic system that most businesses or private 27 sector employers will accept or use for their workers. Furthermo re, the Treasury has systematically and 28 criminally , and with malice, prosecuted all those who offer alternatives, such as: 29 13.5.1. eGold.

The Nation al Commodity and Barter Association (NCBA). 34 In effect, they have removed all other alternatives and forced you into slavery and surety for your public servants, 35 and this has turned our system of government upside down and created a dulocracy, which is a sy stem of 36 government where the servants rule at the point of a gun directed into their Master’s face s (YOU). 37 “ Dulocracy .

The existence of this redeemability provision implies that Federal Reserve Notes are NOT lawful money. 6 Congressman Bob Beers of the Nevada Assembly admitted this in a letter dated January 14, 2008, which we have 7 included later in section 16.7 : 8 No statute defines – or ever has defined – the “one dollar” Federal Reserve Note “FRN” as the “dollar,” or 9 even as a species of “dollar.” Moreover, the United States Code provides that FRNs “shall be redeemed in 10 lawful money on demand at the Treasury Department of the United States . . . or at any Federal Reserve bank.” 11 Thus, FRNs are n ot themselves “lawful money” – otherwise, they would not be “redeemable in lawful money.” 12 And if FRNs are not even “lawful money,” it is inconceivable that they are somehow “dollars,” the very units 13 in which all “United States money is expressed.” 14 [Congres sman Bob Beers of the Nevada Assembly, Letter Dated 1/14/2008 ; See Section 16.7 ] 15 16.2. Federal Reserve Banks by law are required to redeem Federal Reserve Notes and convert them into silver. The 16 only thing stopping them essentially is : 17 16.2.1. Presidential Proclamation 4074 . 12 U.S.C. §95b authorized this Presidential Proclamation. 18 16.2.2. The Silver Certificate Act of 1967, 81 Stat. 77 , which ended redemption of silver certificates. 19 16.3. Congress has NEVER enacted a law ending redeemability of Federal Reserve Notes in silver, and therefore 20 Executive fiat law and not actual law s enacted by Congress is the only thing impeding redeemability in silver. 21 The Silver Certificate Act ended redeemability of silver certificates, which were United States notes issued as 22 silver certificates, but that act did not address Federal Reserve Notes. 23 17. There is no Constitutional authority for the Federal Reserve Notes currently in circulation to be used as “legal tender ” 24 and therefore lawful money for private purposes . The money issued by our government is not issued under the 25 authority to mint coin found in Article 1, Section 8 , Clause 5 , but rather under the authority to borrow found in Article 26 1, Section 8, Clause 2. 27 18. Our present fiat money system is debt based. The U.S. Mint prints Federal Reserve Notes for 3 cents and then the U.S. 28 Government borrows the freshly minted FRNs from the Federal Reserve AT INTEREST. Every dollar currently in 29 circulation was BORROWED from the private, for profit Federal Reserve System. The Federal Reserve is no more 30 “Federal” than Federal Express! 31 19. The fiat Federal Reserve N ote system creates many inequities and injustices which justify its immediate elimination, 32 including: 33 19.1. It makes a franchise out of illegal counterfeiting. 34 19.2. It is rife with moral hazard. 35 19.3. It creates an unconst itutional Title of Nobility, whereby a private, for profit Federal Reserve System has a 36 monopoly on counterfeiting and is protected from the consequences of its illegal act s by the authority of law. 37 19.4. It creates money out of nothing. For instance, it allows banks who are members of the Federal Reserve 38 counterfeiting franchise to loan out ten times the amount of Federal Reserve Notes they have on deposit. 39 19.5. It allows the government to STEAL from the populace by simply printing more money. In that sense, 40 government control over the money supply functions as the equivalent of an additional “invisible tax”. 41 19.6. Every dollar in circulation amounts to a government debt. The more dollars in circulation, the greater the 42 government debt and the more taxes which must be collected to pay the debt. The bigger the money supply, the 43 more unstable and confiscatory the government must become to sustain its addiction to debt. 44 19.7. It rewards the government for counterfeiting by increasing tax revenues. Every time the government print s 45 (counterfeits) more currency using the Federal Reserve counterfeiting franchise , the value of money in circulation 46 goes down, prices and incomes increase, and the result is more tax revenues because of inflation caused by the 47 counterfeiting. 48 19.8. It punishes those who save and favors those who borrow. Those who save are penalized because the value of 49 their money is debased by new money counterfeited by the government. 50 20. The nature of the counterfeiting monopoly and franchise embodied by the Federal Reserve Syst em has allowed the 51 government and the Federal Reserve to acquire undue control over the lives and fortunes of Americans and financial 52 institutions: 53 20.1. Banks who don’t want to participate are coerced into participating by refusal to clear their checks or trans actions 54 within the Federal Reserve Automated Clearing House System (ACH) . 55"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":" The Money Scam 101 of 120 Copyright Sovereignty Education and Defense Ministry, http://sedm.org Form 05.041, Rev. 10- 18- 200 9 EXHIBIT:________ 20.2. Banks who participate become subject to federal law t hat they otherwise would not be subject to, including the 1 Bank Secrecy Act , which causes them to become SPIES for the federal government in the process of complet ing 2 Currency Transaction Reports (CTRs) that are, in most cases, not required and actually FRAUDULENT. See: 3 Demand for Verified Evidence of “Trade or Business” Activity: Currency Transaction Report , Form #04.008 http://sedm.org/Forms/FormIndex.htm 20.3. Being under the thumb of Uncle Sam has effectively made banks into federal employment recruiters for the 4 government. The account applications for these banks ask prospective depositors or borrowers if they are 5 statutory “U.S. citizens” with a Social Security Number or Taxpayer Identification Number, which is a synonym 6 for a government employee domiciled on federal territory and engaged in the “public office” and “trade or 7 business” franchise. Many banks refuse to accept CORRECT, LAWFUL forms documenting the status of 8 depositors as “nonresident aliens” not engaged in the “trade or business” franchise with no identifying numbers , 9 even though it is in full compliance with the law, because they don’t want to be in trouble with their “parens 10 patriae”, Uncle Sam. Such tactics are what we call “corporate fascism”. See: 11 20.3.1.

The face value or “legal tender” value of all the coins offered are not uniformly proportional to their weight. 42 19 21.2. They are not in compliance with the original United States of America Money Act, April 2, 1792, 1 Stat. 246. 20 This act is still in full force and effect and remains unaltered. Notice that Public Law 97 -258 did not repeal this 21 act . You can verify this by examining section 16.5 later. See: 22 http://famguardian.org/Subjects/MoneyBanking/Money/U SAMoneyAct/money_law.htm 23 22. Our present corrupt fiat monetary system was created in the following order, and it must be DISESTABLISHED in the 24 REVERSE order , or chaos and anarchy will prevail : 25 22.1. The Sixteenth Amendment was passed. February 1913. 26 22.2. The Income tax was created. Oct. 3, 1913. 38 Stat. 114- 203 . 27 22.3. The Federal Reserve was established. The Federal Reserve Act was enacted December 23, 1913. 38 Stat. 251. 28 See section 16.1 later. 29 23. The existence of the IRS owes itself to the present corrupt fiat monetary system. The IRS cannot be eliminated until 30 the fiat system is also eliminated: 31 23.1. The sole function of the IRS is to regulate the supply of money. The Federal Reserve counterfeits the money and 32 the IRS retires excess from circulation. 33 23.2. Without a method to retire excess curre ncy from circulation, the American p eople will end up with an unstable 34 monetary system because the U.S. government will be left with no viable way to regulate the supply of money. 35 23.3. “Taxpayer” describes a person who has become surety for the government to re gulate the supply of money. The 36 politicians ensconced in the U.S. Government habitually and repeatedly violate their solemn oath of office to 37 protect and defend the U.S.A. Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic while SPEND ING, 38 BORROW ING , a nd SPEND ING SOME MORE . The “taxpayer” pays the ultimate price for these sins and 39 becomes a human sacrifice to the pagan god of money that U.S. politicians worship. 40   42 On this subject, Congressman Bob Beers of the Nevada Assembly had the following to say: “The base- metallic coinage consists of \"a dollar coin,\" weighing \"8 .1 grams, \" \"a half dollar coin,\" weighing \"11 .34 grams\" ; \"a quarter coin,\" weighing \"5 .67 grams\" : and \"a dime coin,\" weighing \"2 .268 grams.\" All of these coins are composed of copper and nickel. The weights of the dime, the quarter, and the half dollar are in the correct arithmetical proportions, the one to each of the others . But the \"dollar\" is disproportionately light (or the other coins disproportionately heavy) . In this series of base metallic coins, then, the questions naturally arise : Is the \"dollar\" a cupro -nickel coin weighing \"8.1 grams\"? Or is it two cupro - nickel coins (or four or ten coins) collectively weighing 22.68 grams? Or is it both? Or is it neither, but something else altogether, to which the weights of these coins are irrelevant? Similar ly, the gold coinage consists of \"a fifty dollar gold coin\" that \"weighs 33 .931 grams, and contains one troy ounce of fine gold\"; \"a twenty -five dollar gold coin\" that \"contains one- half ounce of fine gold\" ; \"a ten dollar gold coin\" that \"contains one fo urth ounce of fine gold\"; and \"a five dollar gold coin\" that \"contains one tenth ounce of fine gold.\" The \"fifty dollar,\" \"twenty -five dollar,\" and \"five dollar\" coins are in the correct arithmetical proportions each to the others. But the \"ten dollar\" coin is not. Therefore, is a \"dollar\" one- fiftieth or one -fortieth of an ounce of gold? It appears to be undecided .

Admit that NO national emergency justifies suspending any provision of the United States Constitution or creating any 13 new power within the national government . 14 “ Emergency does not create power. Emergency does not increase granted power or remove or diminish the 15 restrictions imposed upon power granted or reserved. The Constitution was adopted in a period of grave 16 emergency. Its grants of power to the federal government and its limitations of the power of the States were 17 determined in the light of emergency, and they are not altered by emergency. What power was thus granted 18 and what limitations were thus imposed are questions [290 U.S. 398, 426] which have always been, and 19 always will be, the s ubject of close examination under our constitutional system. 20 “While emergency does not create power, emergency may furnish the occasion for the exercise of power. 21 'Although an emergency may not call into life a power which has never lived, nevertheless emergency may 22 afford a reason for the exertion of a living power already enjoyed.' Wilson v. New, 243 U.S. 332, 348 , 37 S.Ct. 23 298, 302, L.R.A. 1917E, 938, Ann.Cas. 1918A, 1024. 24 [Home Bldg & Loan Ass’n v. Blaisdell, 290 U.S. 398 (1934) ] 25 ________________________________________________________________________________ 26 “ No emergency justifies the violation of any of the provisions of the United States Constitution. 43 An 27 emergency, however, while it cannot create power, increase gra nted power, or remove or diminish the 28 restrictions imposed upon the power granted or reserved, may allow the exercise of power already in existence, 29 but not exercised except during an emergency. 44 30 The circumstances in which the executive branch may exercise extraordinary powers under the Constitution are 31 very narrow. 45 The danger must be immediate and impending, or the necessity urgent for the public service, 32 such as will not admit of delay, and where the action of the civil authority would be too late in pr oviding the 33 means which the occasion calls for. 46 For example, there is no basis in the Constitution for the seizure of steel 34   43 As to the effect of emergencies on the operation of state constitutions, see § 59. 44 Veix v.

Admit that no power granted to the government by the Constitution may be delegated either to a branch of government 11 not authorized to exercise it or to a private company or corporation without violating the Constitution and the 12 separation of powers doctrine. 13 The police power includes all measures fo r the protection of the life, the health, the property, and the welfare of 14 the inhabitants, and for the promotion of good order and the public morals. It covers the suppression of 15 nuisances, whether injurious to the public health, like unwholesome trades, or to the public morals, like 16 gambling- houses and lottery tickets. Slaughter -House Cases, 16 Wall. 36, 62, 87; Fertilizing Co. v. Hyde Park, 17 97 U.S. 659 ; Phalen v. Virginia, 8 How. 163, 168; Stone v. Mississippi, 101 U.S. 814 . This power, being 18 essential to the maintenance of the authority of local government, and to the safety and welfare of the people, is 19 inalienable. As was said by Chief Justice WAITE, referring to earlier decisions to the same effect: 'No 20 legislature can bargain away the public health or the public morals. The people themselves cannot do it, much 21 less their servants. The supervision of both these subjects of governmental power is continuing in its nature, and 22 they are to be dealt with as the special exigencies of the moment may require. Government is organized with a 23 view to their preservation, and cannot divest itself of the power to provide for them. For this purpose the largest 24 legislative discretion is allowed, and the discretion cannot be parted with any more than the power itself.' Stone 25 v. Mississippi, 101 U.S. 814 , 819.

Hardin, 135 U.S. 100 (1890) ] 29 _______________________________________________________________________________ 30 “'Whatever differences of opinion,' said the court, [in the case of Beer Co. v. Massachusetts, 97 U.S. 28 ] 'may 31 exist as to the extent and boundaries of the police power, and however difficult it may be to render a 32 satisfactory definition of it, there seems to be no doubt that it does extend to the protection of the lives, health, 33 and property of the citizens, and to the preservation of good order and public morals. The legislature cannot by 34 any contract divest itself of the power to provide for these objects. They belong emphatically to that class of 35 objects which demand the application of the maxim, salus populi suprema lex, and they are to be attained 36 and provided for by such appropriate means as the legislative discretion may devise. That discretion can no 37 more be bargained away than the power itself.' 38 ... 39 “In the still more recent cas e of Stone v. Mississippi, 101 U.S. 814 , the whole subject is reviewed in the opinion 40 delivered [111 U.S. 746, 753] by the chief justice. That also was a case of a chartered lottery, whose charter 41 was repealed by a constitution of the state subsequently adopted. It came here for relief, relying on the clause of 42 the federal constitution against impairing the obligation of contracts. 'The question is therefore presented, (says 43 the opinion,) whether, in view of these facts, the legislature of a state can, by the charter of a lottery company, 44 defeat the will of the people authoritatively expressed, in relation to the further continuance of such business in 45 their midst. W e think it cannot. No legislature can bargain away the public health or the public morals. The 46 people themselves cannot do it, much less their servants.

No statute defines - or ever has defined - the \"one dollar\" Federal Reserve Note \"FRN\" as the \"dollar,\" or even as a species of \"dollar .\" Moreover, the United States Code provides that FRNs \"shall be redeemed in lawful money on demand at the Treasury Department of the United States ... or at any Federal Reserve bank .\" Thus, FRNs are not themselves \"lawful money\" - otherwise, they would not be \"redeemable in lawful money .\" And if FRNs are not even \"lawful money,\" it is inconceivable that they are somehow \"dollars,\" the very units in which all \"United States money is expressed .\" People are confused on this point because of the insidious manner in which FRNs \"evolved\" - actually, degenerated is a more appropriate verb - from the late 1920s until today . FRNs of Series 1928 through Series 1950E carried the obligation \"The United States of America will pay to the bearer on demand [some number of) dollars .\" Prior to 1934, the notes carried the inscription \"Redeemable in gold on demand at the United States Treasury, or in gold or lawful money at any Federal Reserve Bank .\" After 1934, the notes carried the inscription \"this note . . . is redeemable in lawful money at the United States Treasury, or at any Federal Reserve Bank\" (post-1934) . Starting with Series 1963, the words \"will pay to the bearer on demand\" no longer appear ; and each FRN simply states a particular denomination in \"dollars .\" The replies you received to your query from both John Ensign's office and the Treasury Department reveal just how confused this situation is . Being a man who considers his word his bond, I would have to say that the FRN is and remains a contract ; whether or not the government chooses to admit this . . . they printed the things . At the top of the contract they proudly proclaim it to be a Federal Reserve Note . At the bottom they declare the value, as in the dollar bill as One Dollar . The value of goods or services the note may purchase has changed, albeit not for the better . However, if you hold a 1900 $20 gold piece, you can still purchase what that coin could buy when it was minted .

The United States Code provides for three different types of coinage denominated in \"dollars\" : namely, base- metallic coinage, gold coinage, and silver coinage . The base-metallic coinage consists of \"a dollar coin,\" weighing \"8 .1 grams,\" \"a half dollar coin,\" weighing \"11 .34 grams\" ; \"a quarter coin,\" weighing \"5 .67 grams\" : and \"a dime coin,\" weighing \"2 .268 grams .\" All of these coins are composed of copper and nickel . The weights of the dime, the quarter, and the half dollar are in the correct arithmetical proportions, the one to each of the others . But the \"dollar\" is disproportionately light (or the other coins disproportionately heavy) . In this series of base metallic coins, then, the questions naturally arise : Is the \"dollar\" a cupro-nickel coin weighing \"8 .1 grams\"? Or is it two cupro- nickel coins (or four or ten coins) collectively weighing 22 .68 grams? Or is it both? Or is it neither, but something else altogether, to which the weights of these coins are irrelevant? Similarly, the gold coinage consists of \"a fifty dollar gold coin\" that \"weighs 33 .931 grams, and contains one troy ounce of fine gold\" ; \"a twenty-five dollar gold coin\" that \"contains one-half ounce of fine gold\" ; \"a ten dollar gold coin\" that \"contains one fourth ounce of fine gold\" ; and \"a five dollar gold coin\" that \"contains one tenth ounce of fine gold .\" The \"fifty dollar,\" \"twenty-five dollar,\" and \"five dollar\" coins are in the correct arithmetical proportions each to the others . But the \"ten dollar\" coin is not . Therefore, is a \"dollar\" one-fiftieth or one-fortieth of an ounce of gold? It appears to be undecided . I would have to say that, based on the oath I took when I assumed this office ; the US Government has not upheld its part on a contract begun back when it first began printing monetary notes . We still trade the notes for goods and services, but the trust is no longer there .

I appreciate your continued interest in this issue . To begin with, I apologize for the confusion my previous letter caused . To clarify, 31 U .S .C . 5116(b)(2) does in fact address the sale of silver and not the dollar . As you pointed out, 31 U .S .C . 5112(e) contains the most accurate definition of a dollar coin . which by statute must contain .999 ounce fine silver . However, as we both know, paper dollars are used much more frequently in circulation, and the U .S . Code does not contain a specific definition of a dollar bill . According to 31 . U .S .C . 5115(a)(2), the Treasury is authorized to print currency notes of \"at least one dollar .\" No law mandates use of the dollar bill, but clearly it has been a more convenient mode of legal tender for Americans in recent decades . As you are likely aware, the Coinage Act of 1965, which modified 31 U .S .C . 5103, states : \"United States coins and currency (including federal reserve notes) are legal tender for all debts, public charges, taxes, and dues .\" Whether individuals utilize coins or paper currency is a matter of personal choice . Similarly, no federal statute mandates that a private business, a person or an organization must accept currency or coins as for payment for goods or services . Private businesses are free to develop their own policies on whether or not to accept cash unless state law says otherwise . Again, thank you for staying in touch with me .

Allen Butler and Geo. F. E dmunds , for plaintiff in error. *435 Thos. H. Talbot and Jas. McKeen , for defend- ant in error. GRAY, J. *421 Juilliard, a citizen of New York, brought an action against Greenman, a citizen of Connecticut, in the circuit court of th e United States for the Southern district of New York, alleging that the plaintiff sold and delivered to the defendant, at his special instance and request , 100 bales of cotton, o f the value and for the agreed price of $5,122.90; and that the defendant agreed to pay that sum in cash on the delivery of the cotton, and had not paid the same or any part thereof, except that he had paid the sum of $22.90 on account, and was now justly indebted to the plaintif f therefor in the sum o f $5,100; and demanding judgment for this sum, with interest and costs. The de fendant in his answer ad- mitted the citizenship of the parties, the purchase and delivery of the cotton, and the agreement to pay therefor, as alleged; and averred that, after the de- livery of the cotton, he offered and tendered to the plaintiff, in full payment, $22.50 in gold coin of the United States, 40 cents in silver coin of the United States, and two United Stat es notes, one of the de- nomination of $5,000 and the other of the denomin- ation of $100, of the description known as United States legal tender notes , purporting by recital thereon to be legal tender, at their respective face values, for all debts, publ ic and private, except du- ties on imports and interest on the public debt, and which, after having been presented for payment, and redeemed and paid in gold coin, since January 1, 1879, at the United States subtreasury in New York, had been reissued and kept in circulation un- der and in pursuance of the act of congress of May 31, 1878, c. 146; that at the time of offering and  tendering these notes, and co in to the plaintiff the sum sum of $5,122.90 was the entire amount due and owing in payment for the cotton, but the p laintiff declined to receive the notes in payment o f $5,100 thereof; and that the defendant had ever since remained, and still was, ready and willing to pay to the plaintiff the sum of $5,100 in these notes, and brought these notes into court, ready to be paid to the plaintiff, if he would accept them. The plaintiff demurred to the answer, upon the grounds that the defense, consisting of new matter, was in- sufficient in law upon its face, and that the facts stated in the answer did not constitute any defense to the cause of action al leged. The circuit court overruled the demurrer and gave judgment for the defendant, and the plaintiff sued out this writ of er- ror. *436 The amount which the plaintiff seeks to re- cover, and which, if the tender pleaded is insuffi- cient in law, he is entitled to recover, is $5,100. There can, therefore, be no doubt of the jurisdiction of this court to revise the judgment of the circuit court. Act Feb. 16, 1875, c. 77, § 3, (18 St. 315.) The notes of the United States, tendered in payment of the defendant's debt to the plaintiff, were origin- ally issued under the acts of congress of February 25, 1862, c. 33; July 11, 1862, c. 142; and March 3, 1863, c. 73, passed during the war of the rebellion, and enacting that these notes should ‘be lawful money and a legal tender in payment of all debts, public and private, within the United States,’ except for duties on imports and interest on the public debt. 12 St. 345, 532, 709.

United States notes shall be lawful money, and a legal tender in payment of all debts, public and private, within the United States, except for duties on imports and interest on the public debt.’ The act of January 14, 1875, c. 15, ‘to provide for the resumption *437 of specie payments,’ enacted that on and after January 1, 1879, ‘the secretary o f the treasury shall redeem in coin the United States legal tender notes then out-standing, on their presentation for redemption at the office of the as- sistant treasurer of the Un ited States in the city o f N ew York, in sums of not less than fifty dollars;’ and authorized him to use for that purpose any sur- p lus revenues in the treasury and the proceeds o f the sales of certain bonds of the United States. 18 St. 296. The act of May 31, 1878, c. 146, under which the notes in question were reissued, is en- titled ‘An act to forbid the further retirement o f United States legal tender notes,’ and enacts as fol- lows: ‘From and after the pa ssage of this act it shall not be lawful for the secretary of the treasury or other officer under him to cancel or retire any more of the United States legal tender notes. And when any of said notes may be redeemed or be received into the treasury under any law, from any source whatever, and shall belong to the United States, they shall not be retired, canceled or destroyed, but they shall be reissued and paid out again and kept  in circulation: provided, that nothing herein shall prohibit the cancellation and destruction of mutil- ated notes and the issue of other notes of like de- nomination in their stead, as now provided by law. All acts and parts of acts in conflict herewith are hereby repealed.’20 St. 87. The manifest intention of this act is that the notes which it directs, after having been redeemed, to be reissued and kept in circulation, shall retain their original quality of being a legal tender. The single question, therefore, to be corsidered, and upon the answer to which the judgment to be rendered b etween these parties depends, is whether notes o f the United States, issued in time of war, under acts of congress declaring them to be a legal tender in p ayment of private debts, and afterwards in time o f peace redeemed and paid in gold coin at the treas- ury, and then reissued und er the act of 1878, can, under the *438 constitution of the United States, be a legal tender in payment of such debts. Upon full consideration of the case, the court is unanimously of opinion that it cannot be distinguished in prin- ciple from the cases heretofore determined, repor- ted under the names of the Legal-tender Cases , 12 Wall. 457; Dooley v. Smith , 13 Wall. 604; Railroa d Co. v. Johnson , 15 Wall. 195; and Maryland v. R ailroad Co. 22 Wall. 105; and all the judges, ex- cept Mr. Justice FIELD, who adheres to the views expressed in his dissenting opinions in those cases, are of opinion that they were rightly decided. The elaborate prin ted briefs submitted by counsel in this case, and the opin ions delivered in the Legal- tender Cases , and in the earlier case of Hepburn v. Griswold , 8 Wall. 630, which those cases over- ruled, forcibly present th e arguments on either side of the question of the power of congress to make the notes of the United States a legal tender in pay- ment of private debts. Without undertaking to deal with all those arguments, the court has though it fit that the grounds of its judgment in the case at bar should be fully stated.

Maryland , 4 Wheat. 316, by which the power of congress to incorporate a bank was demonstrated and affirmed, notwithstanding the constitution does not enum erate, among the powers granted, that of establishing a bank or creating a corporation, The people of the United States by the constitution established a national government, with sovereign powers, legislative, execu tive, and judicial. ‘The government of the Union,’ said Chief Justice MAR- SHALL, ‘though limited in its powers, is supreme within its sphere of action;’‘and its laws, when made in pursuance of the constitution, form the su- preme law of the land.’‘Among the enumerated powers of government, we find the great powers to lay and collect taxes; to borrow money; to regulate commerce; to declare an d conduct a war; and to raise and support armies and navies. The sword and *439 the purse, all the exte rnal relations, and no in- considerable portion of the industry of the nation, are intrusted to its government.’4 Wheat. 405-407. A constitution, establishi ng a frame of government, declaring fundamental prin ciples, and creating a na- tional sovereignty, and intended to endure for ages, and to be adapted to the various crises of human af- fairs, is not to be interpreted with the strictness of a private contract. The co nstitution of the United States, by apt words of designation or general de- scription, marks the outlines of the powers granted to the national legislature; but it does not undertake, with the precision and detail of a code of laws, to enumerate the subdivisions of those powers, or to specify all the means by which they may be carried into execution. Chief Justice MARSHALL, after dwelling upon this view, as required by the very nature of the constitution, by the language in which it is framed, by the limitations upon the general powers of congress introdu ced in the ninth section of the first article, and by the omission to use any restrictive term which might prevent its receiving a fair and just interpretation, added these emphatic words: ‘In considering this question, then, we must  never forget that it is a constitution we are ex- pounding.’4 Wheat. 407. See, also, page 415. The breadth and co mprehensiveness of the words o f the constitution are nowhere more strikingly exhib- ited than in regard to th e powers over the subjects of revenue, finance, and currency, of which there is no other express grant than may be found in these few brief clauses: ‘The congress shall have power-- ‘To lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and ex- cises, to pay the debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States; but all duties, imposts, and excises shall be uniform throughout the United States. ‘To borrow money on the cred it of the United States. ‘To regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the several states, and with the Indian tribes.’ ‘To coin money, regulate the value thereof, and o f foreign coin, and fix the standard of weights and measures.’ *440 The section which contains the grant of these and other principal legislative powers concludes by declaring that the congre ss shall have power-- ‘To make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers, and all other powers vested by this consti- tution in the government of the United States, or in any department or officer thereof.’ By the settled construction and the only reasonable interpretation of this clause the words ‘necessary and proper’ are not limited to such measures as are absolutely and indispensably necessary, without which the powers granted must fail of execution, but they include all a ppropriate means which **126 are conducive or adapted to the end to be accom- plished, and which, in the judgment of congress,  © 2008 Thomson/West.

That clause o f the constitution which declares that ‘the congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises, to pay the debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States,’ either em bodies a grant of power to pay the debts of the United States or presupposes and assumes that power as inherent in the United States as a sovereign government. But, in whichever aspect it be considered, neither this nor any other clause of the constitution makes any men- tion of priority or prefer ence of the United States as a creditor over other creditors of an individual debt- or. Yet this court, in the early case of U. S. v. Fish- er , 2 Cranch, 358, held that, under the power to pay the debts of the United States, congress had the power to enact that debt s due to the United States should have that priority of payment out of the es- tate of an insolvent debtor which the law of Eng- land gave to debts due to the crown. In delivering j udgment in that case, Chief Justice MARSHALL expounded the clause giving congress power to make all necessary and proper laws, as follows: ‘In construing this clause, it would be incorrect, and would produce endless diff iculties, if the opinion should be maintained that no law was authorized *441 which was not indispensably necessary to give effect to a specified power. Where various sys- tems might be adopted for that purpose, it might be said, with respect to each, that it was not necessary, because the end might be obtained by other means. Congress must possess the choice of means, and must be empowered to use any means which are in fact conducive to the exer cise of a power granted by the constitution. The government is to pay the debt of the Union, and must be authorized to use the means which appear to itself the most eligible to effect that object.’2 Cranch, 396. In McCulloch v. Maryland he more fully developed the same view, concluding thus: ‘We admit, as all must admit, that the powe rs of the government are limited, and that its limits are not to be transcended. But we think the sound construction of the constitu- tion must allow to the national legislature that dis-  cretion, with respect to the means by which the powers it confers are to be carried into execution, which will enable that body to perform the high du- ties assigned to it, in the manner most beneficial to the people. Let the end be legitimate, let it be with- in the scope of the constitution and all means which are appropriate, which ar e plainly adapted to that end, which are not prohibited, but consist with the letter and spirit of the constitution, are constitution- al.’4 Wheat. 421. The rule of interpretation thus laid down has been constantly adhered to and acted on by this court, and was accepted as expressing the true test by all the judges who took part in the former discussions of the power of congress to make the treasury notes of the United States a legal tender in payment of private debts. The other judg- ments delivered by Chief Justice MARSHALL con- tain nothing adverse to the power of congress to is- sue legal tender notes. By the articles of confeder ation of 1777, the United States, in congress assemble d, were authorized ‘to borrow money or emit bills on the credit of the United States;’ but it was declared that ‘each state retains its sovereignty, freedom, and independence, and every power, jurisdiction, and right which is *442 not by this confederation expressly delegated to the United States in congress assembled.’Article 2; art. 9, § 5; 1 St. 4, 7. Yet, upon the question whether, under those articl es, congress, by virtue o f the power to emit bills on the credit of the United States, had the power to make bills so emitted a legal tender, Chief Justice MARSHALL spoke very guardedly, saying: ‘Congress emitted bills of credit to a large amount, and did not, perhaps could not, make them a legal tender. This power resided in the states.’ Craig v. Missouri , 4 Pet. 410, 435. But in the constitution, as he had before observed in Mc- Culloch v. Maryland ,‘there is no phrase which, like the articles of **127 confederation, excludes incid- ental or implied powers, and which requires that everything granted shall be expressly and minutely described. Even the tenth amendment, which was framed for the purpose of quieting the excessive j ealousies which had been excited, omits the word  © 2008 Thomson/West. No Claim to Orig. U.S. Govt. Works.

The men who drew and adopted this amendment had expe rienced the embarrass- ments resulting from the insertion of this word in the articles of confederat ion, and probably omitted it to avoid those embarr assments.'4 Wheat. 405, 406. The sentence sometimes quoted from his opin- ion in Sturges v. Crowninshield had exclusive rela- tion to the restrictions imposed by the constitution on the powers of the states, and especial reference to the effect of the clause prohibiting the states from passing laws impairing the obligation of con- tracts, as will clearly ap pear by quoting the whole paragraph: ‘Was this general prohibition intended to prevent paper money? We are not allowed to say so, because it is expressly provided that no state shall ‘emit bills of cred it;’ neither could these words be intended to restrain the states from en- abling debtors to discharge their debts by the tender of property of no real va lue to the creditor, because for that subject also particular provision *443 is made. Nothing but gold and silver coin can be made a tender in payment of debts.'Id. 122, 204. Such reports as have come down to us of the de- bates in the convention that framed the constitution afford no proof of any general concurrence of opin- ion upon the subject before us. The adoption of the motion to strike out the words ‘and emit bills' from the clause ‘to borrow money and emit bills on the credit of the United Stat es' is quite inconclusive. The philippic delivered before the assembly o f Maryland by Mr. Martin, one of the delegates from that state, who voted ag ainst the motion, and who declined to sign the constitution, can hardly be ac- cepted as satisfactory evid ence of the reasons or the motives of the majority of the convention. See 1 El- liot, Deb. 345, 370, 376. Some of the members o f the convention, indeed, as appears by Mr. Madis-  on's minutes of the debates, expressed the strongest opposition to paper money. And Mr. Madison has disclosed the grounds of his own action by record- ing that ‘this vote in the affirmative by Virginia was occasioned by the acquiescence of Mr. Madis- on, who became satisfied th at striking out the words would not disable the government from the use o f public notes, so far as they could be safe and prop- er, and would only cut off the pretext for a paper currency, and particularly for making the bills a tender, either for public or private debts.’But he has not explained why he thought that striking out the words ‘and emit bills' would leave the power to emit bills, and deny the power to make them a tender in payment of debts. And it cannot be known how many of the other delegates, by whose vote the motion was adopted, intended neither to proclaim nor to deny the power to emit paper money, and were influenced by the argument of Mr. Gorham, who ‘was for striking out, without inserting any prohibition,’ and who said: ‘If the words stand, they may suggest and lead to the emission.’‘The power, so far as it will be necessary or safe, will be in- volved in that of borrowing.’5 Elliot, Deb. 434, 435, and note. And after the first clause of the tenth section of the first articl e had been reported in the form in which it now stan ds, forbidding the states to make anything but gold or silver coin a tender in payment of debts, or to pass *444 any law impair- ing the obligation of contracts, when Mr. Gerry, as reported by Mr. Madison, ‘entered into observa- tions inculcating the importance of public faith, and the propriety of the restraint put on the states from impairing the obligation of contracts; alleging that congress ought to be laid under the like prohibi- tions;’ and made a motion to **128 that effect; he was not seconded.Id. 546.As an illustration of the danger of giving too much weight, upon such a question, to the debates and the votes in the con- vention, it may also be observed that propositions to authorize congress to gr ant charters of incorpora- tion for national objects were strongly opposed, es- pecially as regarded banks, and defeated.Id. 440, 543, 544.

The words ‘to borrow money,’ as used in the con- stitution, to designate a power vested in the national government, for the safety and welfare of the whole people, are not to receive that limited and restricted interpretation and meaning which they would have in a penal statute, or in an authority conferred, by law or by contract, upon trustees or agents for private purposes. The power ‘to borrow money on the credit of the United States' is the power to raise money for the public use on a pledge of the public credit, and may be exercise d to meet either present or anticipated expenses and liabilities of the gov- ernment. It includes the power to issue, in return for the money borrowed, the obligations of the United States in any appropriate form, of stock, bonds, bills or notes; and in what ever form they are issued, being instruments of the national government, they are exempt from taxation by the governments of the several states. Weston v. Charleston City Council , 2 Pet. 449; Banks v. Mayor , 7 Wall. 16; Bank v. Sup'rs , 7 Wall. 26. Congress has authority to issue these obligations in a form adapted to circulation from hand to hand in the ordinary transactions o f commerce and business. In order to promote and fa- cilitate such circulation, to adapt them to use as currency, and to make them more current in the market, it may *445 provide for their redemption in coin or bonds, and may make them receivable in payment of debts to the government. So much is settled beyond doubt, and was asserted or distinctly admitted by the judges who dissented from the de- cision in the Legaltender Cases , as well as by those who concurred in that decision. Veazie Bank v. F enno , 8 Wall. 533, 548; Hepburn v. Griswold ,Id. 616, 636; Legaltender Cases , 12 Wall. 543, 544, 560, 582, 610, 613, 637. It is equally well settled that congress has the power to incorporate national banks, with the capacity, for their own profit as well as for the use of the government in its money transactions, of issuing bills which, under ordinary circumstances, pass from hand to hand as money at their nominal value, and which, when so current,  the law has always recognized as a good tender in payment of money debts, unless specifically objec- ted to at the time of the tender. U. S. Bank v. Ban k of Georgia , 10 Wheat. 333, 347; Ward v. Smith , 7 Wall. 447, 451. The power of congress to charter a bank was maintained in McCulloch v. Maryyland , 4 Wheat. 316, and in Osborn v. U. S. Bank , 9 Wheat. 738, chiefly upon the ground that it was an appro- priate means for carrying on the money transactions of the government. But Chief Justice MARSHALL said: ‘The currency which it circulates, by means o f its trade with individuals, is believed to make it a more fit instrument for the purposes of government than it could otherwise be; and, if this be true, the capacity to carry on this trade is a faculty indis- pensable to the character and objects of the institu- tion.’9 Wheat. 864.And Mr. Justice JOHNSON, who concurred with the rest of the court in uphold- ing the power to incorporate a bank, gave the fur- ther reason that it tended to give effect to ‘that power over the currency of the country which the framers of the constitu tion evidently intended to give to congress alone.’Id. 873. The constitutional authority of congress to provide a currency for the whole co untry is now firmly es- tablished. In Veazie Bank v. Fenno , 8 Wall. 533, 548, Chief Justice CHASE, in delivering the opin- ion of the court, said: ‘It cannot be doubted that un- der the constitution the power to provide a *446 circulation of coin is given to congress. And it is settled by the uniform **129 practice of the gov- ernment, and by repeated decisions, that congress may constitutionally authorize the emission of bills of credit.’Congress, having undertaken to supply a national currency, consisting of coin, of treasury notes of the United States, and of the bills of na- tional banks, is authorized to impose on all state banks, or national banks, or private bankers, paying out the notes of individuals or of state banks, a tax of 10 per cent. upon the amount of such notes so paid out. Veazie Bank v. Fenno, supra; Nat. Bank v. U.S. 101 U. S. 1. The reason for this conclusion was stated by Chief Just ice CHASE, and repeated by the present chief justice, in these words: ‘Having  © 2008 Thomson/West. No Claim to Orig. U.S. Govt. Works.

To this end, congress has denied the quality of legal tender to foreign coins, and has provided by law against the imposition of counterfeit and base coin on the community. To the same end, congress may re- strain, by suitable enact ments, the circulation as money of any notes not issued under its own au- thority. Without this power, indeed, its attempts to secure a sound and unifor m currency for the coun- try must be futile.’8 Wall, 549;101 U. S. 6. By the constitution of th e United States, the several states are prohibited from coining money, emitting bills of credit, or making anything but gold and sil- ver coin a tender in payment of debts. But no inten- tion can be inferred from this to deny to congress either of these powers. Mo st of the powers granted to congress are described in the eighth section o f the first article; the limitations intended to be set to its powers, so as to excl ude certain things which might otherwise be taken to be included in the gen- eral grant, are defined in the ninth section; the tenth section is addressed to the states only. This section prohibits the states from doing some things which the United States are expre ssly prohibited from do- ing, as well as from doing some things which the United States are expressl y authorized to do, and from doing some things which are *447 neither ex- pressly granted nor expressly denied to the United States. Congress and the states equally are ex- pressly prohibited from passing any bill of attainder or ex post facto law, or granting any title of nobil- ity. The states are forbi dden, while the president and senate are expressly authorized, to make the treaties. The states are forbidden, but congress is expressly authorized, to co in money. The states are prohibited from emitting bills of credit; but con- gress, which is neither expressly authorized nor ex- pressly forbidden to do so, has, as we have already seen, been held to have the power of emitting bills of credit, and of making every provision for their  circulation as currency, sh ort of giving them the quality of legal tender for private debts, even by those who have denied its authority to give them this quality. It appears to us to follow, as a logical and necessary consequence, that congress has the power to issue the obligat ions of the United States in such form, and to impr ess upon them such qualit- ies as currency for the purchase of merchandise and the payment of debts, as accord with the usage o f sovereign governments. The power, as incident to the power of borrowing money, and issuing bills or notes of the government for money borrowed, o f impressing upon those bills or notes the quality o f being a legal tender for the payment of private debts, was a power universally understood to be- long to sovereignty, in Europe and America, at the time of the framing and adopting of the constitution of the United States. Th e governments of Europe, acting through the monarch or the legislature, ac- cording to the distribution of powers under their re- spective constitutions, had and have as sovereign a power of issuing paper money as of stamping coin. This power has been distin ctly recognized in an im- portant modern case, ab ly argued and fully con- sidered, in which the empero r of Austria, as king o f Hungary, obtained from the English court of chan- cery an injunction agains t the issue in England, without his **130 license, of notes purporting to be public paper money of Hungary. Austria v. Day , 2 Giff. 628, and 3 De Gex, F. & J. 217. The power o f issuing bills of credit, a nd making them, at the dis- cretion of the legislature, a tender in payment o f private debts, had long been exercised in this coun- try *448 by the several colonies and states; and dur- ing the revolutionary war the states, upon the re- commendation of the congres s of the confederation, had made the bills issued by congress a legal tender. See Craig v. Missouri , 4 Pet. 435, 453; Briscoe v. Bank of Kentucky , 11 Pet. 257, 313, 334-336; Legal-tender Cases , 12 Wall. 557, 558, 622; Phillipps on American Paper Currency, p assim . The exercise of this power not being pro- hibited to congress by the constitution, it is in- cluded in the power expressly granted to borrow money on the credit of the United States. © 2008 Thomson/West.

Under the power to borrow money on the credit of the United Stat es, and to issue circulat- ing notes for the money borrowed, its power to define the quality and force of those notes as cur- rency is as broad as the like power over a metallic currency under the power to coin money and to reg- ulate the value thereof. Under the two powers, taken together, congress is authorized to establish a national currency, either in coin or in paper, and to make that currency lawful money for all purposes, as regards the nation government or private indi- viduals. The power of making the notes of the United States a legal tender in payment of private debts, being included in the power to borrow money and to provide a national currency, is not defeated or restricted by the fact that its exercise may affect the value of priv ate contracts. If, upon a j ust and fair interpretation of the whole constitu- tion, a particular power or authority appears to be vested in congress, it is no constitutional objection to its existence, or to it s exercise, that the property or the contracts of individuals may be incidentally affected. The decisions of this court, already cited, afford several examples of this. Upon the issue of stock, bonds, bills, or notes of the United States, the states ar e deprived of their power of taxation to the extent of the property invested by individuals in such obligations, *449 and the burden of state taxation upon other private property is cor- respondingly increased. The 10 per cent. tax, im- p osed by congress on notes of state banks and o f private bankers, not only lessens the value of such notes, but tends to drive them, and all state banks o f issue, out of existence. The priority given to debts due to the United States ov er the private debts of an insolvent debtor diminish es the value of these debts, and the amount which their holders may re- ceive out of the debtor's estate. So, under the power to coin money and to regulate its value, congress  may (as it did with regard to gold by the act of June 28, 1834, c. 95, and with regard to silver by the act of February 28, 1878, c. 20) issue coins of the same denominations as those al ready current by law, but of less intrinsic value than those, by reason of con- taining a less weight of the precious metals, and thereby enable debtors to discharge their debts by the payment of coins of the less real value. A con- tract to pay a certain sum in money, without any stipulation as to the kind of money in which it shall be paid, may always be satisfied by payment of that sum in any currency which is lawful money at the place and time at which payment is to be made. 1 Hale, P.

To q uote once more from the j udgment in McCulloch v. Maryland: ‘Where the law is not prohibited, and is really calculated to ef- fect any of the objects in trusted to the government, to undertake here to inquire into the degree of its necessity would be to pass the line which circum- scribes the judicial department, and to tread on le- gislative ground.’4 Wheat. 423. It follows that the act of May 31, 1878, c. 146, is constitutional and valid, and that the circuit court rightly held that the tender in treasury notes, reis- sued and kept in circulation under that act, was a tender of lawful money in payment of the defend- ant's debt to the plaintiff. Judgment affirmed. *451 FIELD, J., dissenting . From the judgment of the court in this case, and from all the positions advanced in its support, I dis- sent. The question of the power of congress to im- part the quality of legal tender to the notes of the United States, and thus make them money and a standard of value, is not new here. Unfortunately, it has been too frequently before the court, and its latest decision, previous to this one, has never been  entirely accepted and approved by the country. Nor should this excite surprise ; for whenever it is de- clared that this government, ordained to establish j ustice, has the power to alter the condition of con- tracts between private par ties, and authorize their payment or discharge in something different from that which the parties stipulated, thus disturbing the relations of commerce and the business of the com- munity generally, the doctrine will not and ought not to be readily accepted. There will be many who will adhere to the teachings and abide by the faith of their fathers So the qu estion has come again, and will continue to come until it is settled so as to up- hold, and not impair, the contracts of parties, to promote and not defeat justice. If there be anything in the history of the constitu- tion which can be established with moral certainty, it is that the framers of that instrument intended to prohibit the issue of legal-tender notes both by the general government and by the states, and thus pre- vent interference with th e contracts of private parties. **132 During the revolution and the period of the old confederation, the continental congress issued bills of credit, and upon its recommendation the states made them a legal tender, and the refusal to receive them an exting uishment of the debts for which they were offered. They also enacted severe penalties against those who refused to accept them at their nominal value, as equal to coin, in exchange for commodities. And previously, as early as Janu- ary, 1776, congress had declared that if any person should be ‘so lost to all virtue and regard for his country’ as to refuse to receive in payment the bills then issued, he should, on conviction thereof, be ‘deemed, published, and treat ed as an enemy of his county, and precluded *452 from all trade and inter- course with the inhabitants of the colonies.’Yet this legislation proved ineffectual; the universal law o f currency prevailed, which makes promises o f money valuable only as they are convertible into coin. The notes depreciat ed until they became valueless in the hands of their possessors. So it al- ways will be; legislative declaration cannot make the promise of a thing the eq uivalent of the thing it-  © 2008 Thomson/West. No Claim to Orig. U.S. Govt. Works.

The legislation to which th e states were thus in- duced to resort was not confined to the attempt to make paper money a legal tender for debts; but the principle that private cont racts could be legally im- paired, and their obligation disregarded, being once established, other measures equally dishonest and destructive of good faith between parties were ad- opted. What followed is th us stated by Mr. Justice STORY, in his Commentaries: ‘The history, in- deed,’ he says, ‘of the various laws which were passed by the states, in their colonial and independ- ent character, upon this su bject, is startling at once to our morals, to our patriotism, and to our sense o f j ustice. Not only was paper money issued and de- clared to be a tender in payment of debts, but laws of another character, well known under the appella- tion of tender laws, appraisement laws, installment laws, and suspension laws, were from time to time enacted, which prostrated all private credit and all private morals. By some of these laws the due pay- ment of debts was suspended; debts were, in viola- tion of the very terms of the contract, authorized to be paid by installments at different periods; prop- erty of any sort, however worthless, either real or personal, might be tendered by the debtor in pay- ment of his debts; and the creditor was compelled to take the property of the debtor, which he might seize on execution, at an appraisement wholly dis- proportionate to its known value. Such grievances and oppressions, and others of a like nature, were the ordinary results of legislation during the revolu- tionary war and the intermediate period down to the formation of the constitution. They entailed the most enormous evils on the country, and introduced a system of fraud, chican ery, and profligacy which destroyed all private co nfidence and all industry and enterprise.’Vol. 2, § 1371. *453 To put an end to this vicious system of legis- lation which only encourag ed fraud, thus graphic- ally described by STORY, the clauses which forbid the states from emitting bills of credit or making anything but gold and silver a tender in payment o f  debts, or passing any law imparing the obligation o f contracts, were inserted in the constitution.‘The at- tention of the convention , therefore,’ says Chie f Justice MARSHALL, ‘was particularly directed to paper money and to acts which enable the debtor to discharge his debt otherwise than was stipulated in the contract. Had nothing more been intended, nothing more would have been expressed, but, in the opinion of the convention, much more remained to be done. The same misc hief might be effected by other means. To restore public confidence com- pletely, it was necessary, not only to prohibit the use of particular means by which it might be ef- fected, but to prohibit the use of any means by which the same mischief might be produced. The convention appears to have intended to establish a great principle, that contracts should be inviolable.’ Sturges v. Crowninshield , 4 Wheat. 206. It would be difficult to be lieve, even in the absence of the historical **133 evidence we have on the subject, that the framers of the constitution, pro- foundly impressed by the evils resulting from this kind of legislation, ever intended that the new gov- ernment, ordained to establish justice, should pos- sess the power of making its bills a legal tender, which they were unwilling should remain with the states, and in which the past had proved so danger- ous to the peace of the co mmunity, so disturbing to the business of the people, and so destructive o f their morality. The great historian of ou r country has recently giv- en to the world a history of the convention, the res- ult of years of labor in the examination of all public documents relating to its formation and of the re- corded opinions of its framers; and thus he writes: ‘With the full recollection of the need or seeming need of paper money in the revolution, with the menace of danger in futu re time of war from its prohibition, authority to issue bills of *454 credit that should be legal tender was refused to the gen- eral government by the vote of nine states against N ew Jersey and Maryland.

History cannot name a man who has gained enduring honor by causing the issue of paper money. Wherever such paper has been employ ed it has, in every case, thrown upon its authors th e burden of exculpation under the plea of pressing necessity.'Bancroft's His- tory of the formation of the constitution of the United States, vol. 2, p. 134. And when the conven- tion came to the prohibition upon the states, the his- torian says that the clause, ‘No state shall make anything but gold and silver a tender in payment o f debts,’ was accepted without a dissentient state.‘So the adoption of the constitution,’ he adds, ‘is to be the end forever of paper money, whether issued by the several states or by the United States, if the con- stitution shall be rightly interpreted and honestly obeyed.’Id. 137. For nearly three-quarters of a century after the ad- option of the constitution, and until the legislation during the recent civil war, no jurist and no states- man of any position in the country ever pretended that a power to impart the quality of legal tender to its notes was vested in the general government. There is no recorded word of even one in favor o f its possessing the power. All conceded, as an axiom of constitutional law, that the power did not exist. Mr. Webster, from his first entrance into public life in 1812, gave great consideration to the subject o f the currency, and in an elaborate speech on that subject, made in the senate in 1836, then sitting in this room, he said: *455 ‘Currency, in a large and perhaps just sense, includes not only gold and silver and bank bills, but bills of exchange also. it may in- clude all that adjusts exch anges and settles balances in the operations of trad e and business; but if we understand by currency the legal money of the  country, and that which constitutes a legal tender for debts, and is the standa rd measure of value, then undoubtedly nothing is included but gold and sil- ver. Most unquestionably there is no legal tender, and there can be no legal tender in this country, un- der the authority of this government or any other, but gold and silver, either the coinage of our own mints or foreign coins at rates regulated by con- gress. This is a constitutional principle, perfectly plain and of the highest importance. The states are expressly prohibited from making anything but gold and silver a legal tender in payment of debts; and although no such express prohibition is applied to congress, yet, as congress has no power granted to it in this respect but to coin money and to regulate the value of **134 foreign coins, it clearly has no power to substitute paper or anything else for coin as a tender in payment of debts and in discharge o f contracts. Congress has ex ercised this power fully in both its branches; it has coined money and still coins it; it has regulated the value of foreign coins, and still regulates their value. The legal tender, therefore, the constitutional standard of value, is es- tablished and cannot be overthrown. To overthrow it would shake the whole system.’4 Webster's Works, 271. When the idea of imparting the legal-tender quality to the notes of the United States, issued under the first act of 1862, was fi rst broached, the advocates of the measure rested their support of it on the ground that it was a war measure, to which the country was compelled to resort by the exigencies of its condition, being then sorely pressed by the confederate forces, and requiring the daily ex- penditure of enormons sums to maintain its army and navy and to carry on the government. The rep- resentative who introduced the bill in the house de- clared that it was a measure of that nature, ‘one o f necessity and not of choice;’ that the times were ex- traordinary; and that ex traordinary measures must be resorted to in order to save our government and preserve our nationality.

In the senate also the measure was pressed for the same reasons. When the act was reported by the committee on finance, it s chairman, while opposing the legal-tender provision, said: ‘It is put on the ground of absolute, overwhelming necessity; that the government has now arrived at that point when it must have funds, and those funds are not to be obtained from ordinary sources, or from any of the expedients to which we have heretofore had re- course, and therefore this new, anomalous, and re- markable provision must be resorted to in order to enable the government to pay off the debt that it now owes, and afford circulation which will be available for other purposes.’Cong. Globe, 1861-62, pt. 1, 764. And upon that ground the pro- vision was adopted, some of the senators stating that in the exigency th en existing money must be had, and they therefore su stained the measure, al- though they apprehended danger from the experi- ment. ‘The medicine of the constitution,’ said Sen- ator Summer, ‘must not become its daily food.’Id. 800. A similar necessity was urged upon the state tribunals and this court in justification of the meas- ure, when its validity was questioned. The dissent- ing opinion in Hepburn v. Griswold referred to the pressure that was upon the government at the time to enable it to raise an d support an army, and to provide and maintain a na vy. Chief Justice CHASE, who gave the prevailing opinion in that case, also spoke of the existence of the feeling when the bill was passed that the provision was necessary. He favored the provision on that ground when secret- ary of the treasury, although he had come to that conclusion with reluctan ce, and recommended its adoption by congress. When the question as to its validity reached this court, this expression of favor was referred to, and by many it was supposed that it would control his judicial action. But after long pondering upon the *457 subject, after listening to repeated arguments by able counsel, he decided against the constitutionality of the provision; and,  holding in his hands the casting vote, he determined the judgment of the court. He thus preferred to pre- serve his integrity as a ju dicial officer rather than his consistency as a statesman. In his opinion he thus referred to his previous views: ‘It is not sur- prising that amid the tumult of the late civil war, and under the influence of apprehensions for the safety of the republic almost universal, different views, never before entertained by American states- men or jurists, were adopted by many. The time was not favorable to consid erate reflection upon the constitutional limits of legislative or executive au- thority. If power was assumed from patriotic motives, the assumption found **135 ready justific- ation in patriotic hearts. Many who doubted yielded their doubts; many who did not doubt were silent. Some who were strongly averse to making govern- ment notes a legal tender felt themselves con- strained to acquiesce in the views of the advocates of the measure. Not a fe w who then insisted upon its necessity, or acquiesced in that view, have, since the return of peace, and un der the influence of the calmer time, reconsidered their conclusions, and now concur in those which we have just announced. These conclusions seem to us to be fully sanctioned by the letter and spirit of the constitution.’8 Wall. 625. It must be evident, however, upon reflection that, i f there were any power in the government of the United States to impart the quality of legal tender to its promissory notes, it was for congress to determ- ine when the necessity for its exercise existed; that war merely increased the urgency for money; it did not add to the powers of the government nor change their nature; that if the power existed it might be equally exercised when a loan was made to meet ordinary expenses in time of peace, as when vast sums were needed to support an army or a navy in time of war. The wants of the government could never be the measure of its powers. But in the ex- citement and apprehensions of the war these con- siderations were unheeded; the measure was passed as one of overruling *458 necessity in a perilous crisis of the country.

Never before was it contended by any j urist or commentator on the constitution that the government, in full receipt of ample income, with a treasury overflowing, with more money on hand than it knows what to do with, could issue paper money as a legal tender. What was in 1862 called the ‘medicine of the constitution’ has now become its daily bread. So it always happens that whenever a wrong principle of conduct, political or personal, is adopted on a plea of necessity, it will be after- wards followed on a plea of convenience. The advocates of the meas ure have not been con- sistent in the designation of the power upon which they have supported its validity, some placing it on the power to borrow money, some on the coining power, and some have claimed it as an incident to the general powers of the government. In the present case it is placed by the court upon the power to borrow money, and the alleged sover- eignty of the United States over the currency. It is assumed that this power, when exercised by the government, is something di fferent from what it is when exercised by corpora tions or individuals, and that the government has, by the legal tender provi- sion, the power to enfor ce loans of money, because the sovereign governments of European countries have claimed and exercised such power. ‘The words ‘to borrow money,” says the court, ‘are not to receive that limited and restricted interpretation and meaning which they would have in a penal stat- ute or in an authority conferred by law or by con- tract upon trustees or agents for private pur- poses.’And it adds that ‘the power, as incident to the power of borrowing money and issuing bills or notes of the government for money borrowed, o f impressing upon those bills or notes the quality o f being a legal tender for the payment of private debts, was a power universally understood to be- long to sovereignty, in Europe and America, at the time of the framing and adoption of the constitution of the United Stat es. The governments *459 o f Europe, acting through the monarch or the legis- lature, according to the distribution of powers under  their respective constitutions, had and have as sov- ereign a power of issuing paper money as of stamp- ing coin,’ and that ‘the exercise of this power not being prohibited to congress by the constitution, it is included in the power expressly granted to bor- row money on the credit of the United States.’ As to the terms ‘to borrow money,’ where, I would ask, does the court find any authority for giving to them a different interpretation in the constitution from what they receive wh en used in other instru- ments, as in the **136 charters of municipal bodies or of private corporations, or in the contracts of in- dividuals? They are not ambiguous; they have a well-settled meaning in other instruments. If the court may change that in the constitution, so it may the meaning of all other clauses; and the powers which the government may exercise will be found declared, not by plain word s in the organic law, but by words of a new significance resting in the minds of the judges. Until some authority beyond the al- leged claim and practice of the sovereign govern- ments of Europe be produced, I must believe that the terms have the same meaning in all instruments, wherever they are used; that they mean a power only to contract for a loan of money, upon consid- erations to be agreed be tween the parties. The con- ditions of the loan, or wh ether any particular secur- ity shall be given to the lender, are matters of ar- rangement between the partie s; they do not concern any one else. They do not imply that the borrower can give to his promise to refund the money any se- curity to the lender outside of property or rights which he possesses. The transaction is completed when the lender parts with his money and the bor- rower gives his promise to pay at the time and in the manner and with the securities agreed upon. Whatever stipulations may be made, to add to the value of the promise, or to secure its fulfillment, must necessarily be limited to the property, rights, and privileges, which the borrower possesses. Whether he can add to his promises any element which will induce others *460 to receive them bey- ond the security which he gives for their payment depends upon his power to control such element.

It will hardly be pretended that the government of the United States has any power to enter into an engagement that, as security for its notes, the lender shall have special privileges with respect to the visible property of others, shall be able to occupy a portion of their lands or their houses, and thus interfere with the possession and use of their property. If the government cannot do that, how can it step in and say, as a condition o f loaning money, that the lender shall have a right to interfere with contracts be tween private parties? A large proportion of the property of the world exists in contracts, and the government has no more rignt to deprive one of their value by legislation operat- ing directly upon them than it has a right to deprive one of the value of any visible and tangible prop- erty. No one, I think, will pretend that individuals or corporations possess the power to impart to their evidences of indebtedness any quality by which the holder will be able to aff ect the contracts of other parties, strangers to the loan; nor would any one pretend that congress possesses the power to impart any such quality to the no tes of the United States, except from the clause authorizing it to make laws necessary and proper to th e execution of its powers. That clause, however, does not enlarge the ex- pressly designated powers; it merely states what congress could have done without its insertion in the constitution. Without it congress could have ad- opted any appropriate m eans to borrow; but that can only be appropriate for that purpose which has some relation of fitness to the end, which has re- spect to the terms essential to the contract, or to the securities which the borr ower may furnish for the repayment of the loan. The quality of legal tender does not touch the terms of the contract; that is complete without it; nor does it stand as a security for the loan, for *461 a security is a thing pledged, over which the borrower has some control, or in which he holds some interest. The argument presented by the advocates of legal tender is, in substance, this: The object of borrow- ing is to raise funds, the addition of the quality o f legal tender to the notes of the government will in- duce parties to take them, and funds will thereby be more readily loaned. But the same thing may be **137 said of the addition of any other quality which would give to the holder of the notes some advantage over the property of others, as, for in- stance, that the notes should serve as a pass on the public conveyances of the country, or as a ticket to places of amusement, or sh ould exempt his property from state and municipal taxation, or entitle him to the free use of the telegraph lines, or to a percent- age from the revenues of private corporations. The same consequence-a ready acceptance of the notes- would follow; and yet no one would pretend that the addition of privileges of this kind with respect to the property of others, over which the borrower has no control, would be in any sense an appropri- ate measure to the execution of the power to bor- row. Undoubtedly the power to borrow includes the power to give evidences of the loan in bonds, treas- ury notes, or in such other form as may be agreed between the parties. These may be issued in such amounts as will fit them for circulation, and for that purpose may be made payable to bearer, and trans- ferable by delivery. Experience has shown that the form best fitted to secure their ready acceptance is that of notes payable to bearer, in such amounts as may suit the ability of the lender. The government, in substance, says to parties with whom it deals: Lend us your money, or furnish us with your products or your labor, and we will ultimately pay you, and as evidence of it we will give you our notes, in such form and amount as may suit your convenience, and enable you to transfer them; we will also receive them for certain demands due to us. In all this matter there is only a dealing between the government and the individuals who trust it. The transaction concerns no others. The power which authorizes it is a very different one from a *462 power to deal between parties to private con- tracts in which the government is not interested, and to compel the receipt of these promises to pay  © 2008 Thomson/West.

This latter power is not an incident to the former; it is a distinct an d far greater power. There is no legal connection between the two-between the power to borrow from those willing to lend and the p ower to interfere with th e independent contracts o f others. The possession of this latter power would j ustify the interference of the government with any rights of property of other parties, under the pre- tense that its allowance to the holders of the notes would lead to their more ready acceptance, and thus furnish the needed means. The power vested in congress to coin money does not in my judgment fortify the position of the court, as its opinion affirms. So far from deducing from that power any authority to impress the notes of the government with the quality of legal tender, its ex- istence seems to me inconsistent with a power to make anything but coin a legal tender. The meaning of the terms ‘to coin money’ is not at all doubtful. It is to mould metallic substances into forms con- venient for circulation and to stamp them with the impress of the government authority indicating their value with reference to the unit of value estab- lished by law. Coins are pieces of metal of definite weight and value, stamped such by the authority o f the government. If any doubt could exist that the power has reference to metallic substances only it would be removed by the language which immedi- ately follows, authorizing congress to regulate the value of money thus coined and of foreign coin, and also by clauses ma king a distinction between coin and the obligations of the general government and of the states. Thus, in the clause authorizing congress ‘to provide for the punishment of counter- feiting the securities and current coin of the United States,’ a distinction is made between the obliga- tions and the coin of the government. Money is not only a medium of exchange, but it is a standard of value. Nothing can be such standard which has not intrinsic *463 value, or which is sub- j ect to frequent changes in value. From the earliest period in the history of civilized nations we find  pieces of gold and silver used as money. These metals are scattered over the world in small quantit- ies; they are susceptible of **138 division, capable of easy impression, have more value in proportion to weight and size, and are less subject to loss by wear and abrasion than any other material possess- ing these qualities. It requires labor to obtain them; they are not dependent upon legislation or the caprices of the multitude ; they cannot be manufac- tured or decreed into ex istence; and they do not perish by lapse of time. Th ey have, therefore, natur- ally, if not necessarily, become throughout the world a standard of value. In exchange for pieces o f them, products requiring an equal amount of labor are readily given. When the product and the piece of metal represent the same labor, or an approxima- tion to it, they are freel y exchanged. There can be no adequate substitute for these metals. Says Mr. Webster, in a speech made in the house of repres- entatives in 1815: ‘The circulating medium of a commercial community must be that which is also the circulating medium of other commercial com- munities, or must be capab le of being converted in- to that medium without loss. It must also be able not only to pass in payments and receipts among in- dividuals of the same society and nation, but to ad- j ust and discharge the balance of exchanges between different nations. It must be something which has a value abroad as well as at home, by which foreign as well as domestic debts can be sat- isfied. The precious metals alone answer these pur- poses. They alone, therefore, are money, and whatever else is to perform the functions of money must be their representative, and capable of being turned into them at will. So long as bank paper re- tains this quality it is a substitute for money; di- vested of this, nothing can give it that character.’3 Webster's Works, 41. The clause to coin money must be read in connection with the prohibition upon the states to make anything but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts. The two taken together *464 clearly show that the coins to be fab- ricated under the authority of the general govern- ment, and as such to be a legal tender for debts, are to be composed principally, if not entirely, of the  © 2008 Thomson/West.

Coins of such metals are necessarily a legal tender to the amount of their re- spective values, without an y legislative enactment, and the statute of the United States providing that they shall be such tender is only declaratory of their effect when offered in payment. When the constitution says , therefore, that congress shall have the power to coin money, interpreting that clause with the prohibition upon the states, it says it shall have the power to make coins of the precious metals a legal tender, for that alone which is money can be a legal tender. If this be the true import of the language, nothing else can be made a legal tender. We all know that the value of the notes of the government in the market, and in the commercial world generally, depends upon their convertibility on demand into coin; and as confid- ence in such convertibility increases or diminishes, so does the exchangeable value of the notes vary. So far from becoming th emselves standards o f value by reason of the legi slative declaration to that effect, their own value is measured by the facility with which they can be ex changed into that which alone is regarded as money by the commercial world. They are promises of money, but they are not money in the sense of the constitution. The term ‘money’ is used in that instrument in several clauses,-in the one authorizing congress ‘to borrow money;’ in the one authorizing congress ‘to coin money;’ in the one declari ng that ‘no money’ shall b e drawn from the treasury, but in consequence o f appropriations made by law; and in the one declar- ing that no state shall ‘coin money.’ And it is a settled rule of interpretation that the same term oc- curring in different parts of the same instrument shall be taken in the same sense, unless there is something in the context in dicating that a different meaning was intended. Now, to coin money is, as I have said, to make coins out of metallic substances, and the only money the value of which congress can regulate is coined money, either of our mints, or of foreign *465 countries. It s hould seem, there- fore, that to borrow money, is to obtain a loan o f coin money; that is, money composed of the **139 precious metals, representing value in the purchase of property and payment of debts. Between the promises of the government , designated as its se- curities, and this money, the constitution draws a distinction, which disappears in the opinion of the court. The opinion not only declares that it is in the power of congress to make the notes of the govern- ment a legal tender and a standard of value, but that under the power to coin money and regulate the value thereof, congress may issue coins of the same denominations as those now already current, but o f less intrinsic value, by reason of containing a less weight of the precious me tals, and thereby enable debtors to discharge their debts by payment o f coins of less real value. This doctrine is put forth as in some way a justification of the legislation au- thorizing the tender of nominal money in place o f real money in payment of debts. Undoubtedly con- gress has power to alter the value of coins issued, either by increasing or diminishing the alloy they contain; so it may alter, at its pleasure, their denom- inations; it may hereafter call a dollar an eagle, and it may call an eagle a dollar. But if it be intended to assert that congress can make the coins changed the equivalent of those having a greater value in their previous condition, and compel parties contracting for the latter to receive coins with diminished value, I must be permitted to deny any such author- ity. Any such declaration on its part would be not only utterly inoperative in fact, but a shameful dis- regard of its constitutional duty. As I said on a former occasion: ‘The powe r to coin money, as de- clared by this court, is a great trust devolved upon congress, carrying with it the duty of creating and maintaining a uniform standard of value throughout the Union, and it would be a manifest abuse of this trust to give to the coins issued by its authority any other than their real value. By debasing the coins, when once the standard is fixed, is meant giving to the coins by their form and impress a certificate o f their having a relation to that standard different from that which in truth *466 they possess; in other words, giving to the coins a false certificate of their value.

The changes from time to time in the quantity of al- loy in the different coins has been made to preserve the proper relative value between gold and silver, or to prevent exportation, and not with a view o f debasing them. Whatever power may be vested in the government of the United States, it has none to perpetrate such monstrous iniquity. One of the great purposes of its creation, as expressed in the pre- amble of the constitution, was the establishment o f j ustice, and not a line nor a word is found in that in- strument which sanctions any intentional wrong to the citizen, either in war or in peace. But beyond and above all the objections which I have stated to the decision recognizing a power in congress to impart the legal-tender quality to the notes of the government, is my objection to the rule of construction, adopted by the court to reach its conclusions-a rule which, fully carried out, would change the whole nature of our constitution, and break down the barriers which separate a govern- ment of limited from one of unlimited powers. When the constitution came before the conventions of the several states for adoption, apprehension ex- isted that other powers than those designated might be claimed; and it led to the first 10 amendments. When these were presented to the states they were preceded by a preamble stat ing that the conventions of a number of the states had, at the time of adopt- ing the constitution, expressed a desire, ‘in order to prevent misconception or abuse of its powers, that further declaratory and rest rictive clauses should be added.’ **140 One of them is found in the tenth amendment, which declares *467 that ‘the powers not delegated to the United States by the constitu- tion, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people.’The  framers of the constitution, as I have said, were profoundly impressed with the evils which had res- ulted from the vicious legislation of the states mak- ing notes a legal tender, and they determined that such a power should not exist any longer. They therefore prohibited the stat es from exercising it, and they refused to grant it to the new government which they created. Of wh at purpose is it, then, to refer to the exercise of th e power by the absolute or the limited governments of Europe, or by the states previous to our constitu tion? Congress can exercise no power by virtue of any supposed inherent sover- eignty in the general government. Indeed, it may be doubted whether the power can be correctly said to appertain to sovereignty in any proper sense, as an attribute of an independent political community. The power to commit violence, perpetrate injustice, take private property by force without compensa- tion to the owner, and comp el the receipt of prom- ises to pay in place of money, may be exercised, as it often has been, by irresponsible authority, but it cannot be considered as belonging to a government founded upon law. But be that as it may, there is no such thing as a power of inherent sovereignty in the government of the United States. It is a government of delegated powers, supreme within its prescribed sphere, but powerless outside of it. In this country, sovereignty resides in the people, and congress can exercise no power which they have not, by their constitution, intrusted to it; all else is withheld. It seems, however, to be supp osed that, as the power was taken from the states, it could not have been in- tended that it should disappear entirely, and there- fore it must, in some way, adhere to the general government, notwithstanding the tenth amendment and the nature of the constitution. The doctrine that a power not expressly forbidden may be exercised would, as I have observed , change the character o f our government. If I have read the constitution aright, if there is any weight to be given to the uni- form teachings of our great jurists and of comment- ators *468 previous to the late civil war, the true doctrine is the very opposite of this. If the power is not in terms granted, and is not necessary and prop- er for the exercise of a po wer which is thus granted,  © 2008 Thomson/West. No Claim to Orig. U.S. Govt. Works.

And in determining what measures may be adopted in executi ng the powers granted, Chief Justice MARSHALL d eclares that they must be appropriate, plainly ad apted to the end, not pro- hibited, and consistent with the letter and spirit o f the constitution . Now, all through that instrument we find limitations upon the power, both of the general government and the state governments, so as to prevent oppression and injustice. No legisla- tion, therefore, tending to promote either can con- sist with the letter and spirit of the constitution. A law which interferes with the contracts of others, and compels one of the parties to receive in satis- faction something different from that stipulated, without reference to its actual value in the market, necessarily works such injustice and wrong. There is, it is true, no provision in the constitution of the United States forbidding in direct terms the passing of laws by congress impairing the obliga- tion of contracts, and there are many express powers conferred, such as the power to declare war, levy duties, and regulate co mmerce, the exercise o f which affects more or le ss the value of contracts. Thus, war necessarily suspends intercourse between the citizens or subjects of belligerent nations, and the performance during its continuance of previous contracts. The imposition of duties upon goods may affect the prices of arti cles imported or manufac- tured, so as to materially alter the value of previous contracts respecting them. But these incidental con- sequences arising from the exercise of such powers were contemplated in the grant of them. As there can be no solid objection to legislation under them, no just complaint can be made **141 of such con- sequences. But far different is the case when the impairment of the contract does not follow incid- entally, but is directly and in terms allowed and en- acted. Legislation operating directly upon private contracts, changing their conditions, is forbidden to the states; and no power to alter the stipulations o f such contracts by direct legislation *469 is con- ferred upon congress. There are also many consid- erations, outside of the fact that there is no grant o f the power, which show that the framers of the con-  stitution never intended that such power should be exercised. One of the great objects of the constitu- tion, as already observed, was to establish justice, and what was meant by that in its relations to con- tracts, as said by the late chief justice in his opinion in Hepburn v. Griswold , was not left to interference or conjecture. And in support of this statement he refers to the fact that when the constitution was un- dergoing discussion in the convention, the congress of the confederation was en gaged in framing the or- dinance for the government of the Northwest territ- ory, in which certain articles of compact were es- tablished between the people of the original states and the people of the territory ‘for the purposes,’ as expressed in the instrument, ‘of extending the fun- damental principles of civil and religious liberty, whereon these republics, [the states united under the confederation,] their laws and constitutions, are erected.’That congress was also alive to the evils which the loose legislation of the states had created by interfering with the obligation of private con- tracts and making notes a legal tender for debts; and the ordinance declared th at in the just preserva- tion of rights and property no law ‘ought ever to be made, or have force in the said territory, that shall in any manner whatever interfere with or affect private contracts, or engagements, bona fide and without fraud previously formed.’This principle, said the chief justice, found more condensed ex- pression in the prohibition upon the states against impairing the obligation of contracts, which has al- ways been recognized ‘as an efficient safeguard against injustice;’ and the court was then of opinion that ‘it is clear that those who framed and those who adopted the constitution intended that the spirit of this prohibition should pervade the entire body of legislation, and that the justice which the consti- tution was ordained to establish was not thought by them to be compatible with legislation of an oppos- ite tendency.’Soon after the constitution was adop- ted the case of Calder v. Bull came before this court, and it was *470 there said that there were acts which the federal and state legislatures could not do without exceeding their authority; and among them was mentioned a law which punished a  © 2008 Thomson/West.

And Mr. Madis- on, in one of the articles in the Federalist , declared that laws impairing the obligation of contracts were contrary to the first prin ciples of the social com- pact, and to every principle of sound legislation. Yet this court holds that a measure directly operat- ing upon and necessarily impairing private con- tracts, may be adopted in the execution of powers specifically granted for other purposes because it is not in terms prohibited, and that it is consistent with the letter and spirit of the constitution. From the decision of the court I see only evil likely to follow. There have been times within the memory of all of us when the legal-tender notes o f the United States were not exchangeable for more than one-half of their nominal value. The possibil- ity of such depreciation wi ll always attend paper money. This inborn infirmity no mere legislative declaration can cure. If congress has the power to make the notes a legal tender and to pass as money or its equivalent, why should not a sufficient amount be issued to pay the bonds of the United States as they nature? Wh y pay interest on the mil- lions of dollars of bonds now due when congress can in one day make the money to pay **142 the principal? And why should there be any restraint upon unlimited appropriations by the government for all imaginary schemes of public improvement, if the printing-press can furnish the money that is needed for them?
