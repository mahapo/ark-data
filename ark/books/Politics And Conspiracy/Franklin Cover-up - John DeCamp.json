In the years since the first copies of The Franklin Cover­ Up hit the streets, not only have I and others learned far more about the Larry King political sub-culture of drugs and child abuse and the horrors of child abuse committed and covered-up by certain members of the Catholic clergy, but the circulation of The Franklin Cover­ Up throughout the United States has brought many new cases to my doorstep. And, one after another. I have become involved as attorney on one side or the other in these startling cases-from Columbine to the Oklahoma Bombing; from MY first-of-its-kind lawsuit against any Catholic Diocese for covering up .child abuse by priests to today, when it seems every day brings a new revelation about the abuse and use of children by clergy. What I was condemned for saying 15 years ago, when the first edition of The Franklin Cover-Up first came out, is now shouted from the rafters of the churches and POLITICAL HALLS across the United States. AND THE ABUSES ARE BEING CORRECTED. When this book first came out, it was the first to open the ugly side of many of these issues-and I was certainly condemned by many for doing so. In fact, I was so threatened because of that first book that I had to move my entire family to a small town of 300 people, Clatonia, Nebraska, where I felt I had more security and neighbors to help watch out for and protect my children. That move has worked out fine for me. And my children are the greatest ever. I wish I COULD DROP THIS ISSUE ENTIRELY, but I have too many daily, weekly calls from folk all over America asking for help or guidance or information or direction on their particular problems. Hence, I thought the best way to answer them was to make this book available to them with current updates. That is part of what I have tried to do in this 200412005 edition of The Franklin Cover-Up. I have never spent one penny advertising or promoting this book. However, whatever caused it, it has sold well over 110,000 (One Hundred Ten Thousand) copies. Hopefully, it will do some good for some and give courage to others to Fight Back and Tell the Truth. John DeCamp December 2004/January 2005 ...

Boner was \" ... mildly sedated and calmed down ... and put in a private room for 'observation.' \" When nurses came to check on him early next morning, Boner was sitting in a chair, bleeding from the mouth and quite dead. Former FBI Los Angeles Bureau Chief Ted Gunderson tried to get autopsy and other information and details that were promised him on Boner's death, but Gunderson, and appar­ ently every other entity, were totally shut out of all information. No news stories on Boner's death were published in the news, despite Boner's previous front page fame and \"notoriety\" in the Franklin case.

DECAMP is trying to collect the million dollar judgment he won against Larry King but Larry claims he ... has no money.\" JOHN KERRY & BOB KERREY both tried to become President and George W. Bush became President. JOHN KERRY claimed he knew of horrible atrocities done in Vietnam but JOHN DECAMP helped establish in 200 1, 2002, 2003 that Lt. Bob Kerrey was the officer in charge who ordered slaughter of 25 unarmed women & children at place called Thanh Phong in Vietnam, for which Kerrey was decorated under claim that these had been armed Viet Cong soldiers. DeCamp returned to Vietnam in 2001 and met with the \"survivors of the Thanh Phong massacre\" and was asked to help them. DeCamp directly contacted both Senators Bob Kerrey and John Kerry to look into the matter and see if they were willing to help out these survivors. BOTH JOHN KERRY AND BOB KERREY REFUSED to do anything."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"------------------- - Catholic Church and many clergy members have been sued success­ fully in lawsuits identical to DeCamp's first lawsuit against the Church. DeCamp's suit first showed Americans the very serious problem with abuse and cover up of the abuse throughout the United States by members of the Catholic clergy. Boys Town and the Archdiocese of Omaha have now also been named in multiple lawsuits for the identical activities that DeCamp alleged in his 1991 lawsuit, which, as stated, was the first of its kind in America to open and expose this abuse cesspool. FINAL COMMENT & UPDATE: I have become involved in a number of super high profile cases since First Edition of Franklin Cover-Up came out .... but, perhaps the most frightening to me has been the COLUMBINE case where I represented various victims of the massacre and/or their families. I believe as a result of those cases I am the only lawyer to have taken the depositions of the Harris boy's mother & father, and I am one of the only victims' lawyers to have seen certain Columbine materials and tapes. I have reached certain conclusions on Columbine which I feel obligated to put into print here in hopes it will some day make a difference. More court action has been done to keep everything secret and destroy the depositions than anything 1 have seen in my 40 years of court activity. SO, for my own personal and LEGAL safety and protection. let me say simply that everything-absolutely every thing-l say here is simply MY OPINION AND BELIEF and not done to violate any court orders or sealed records. But say these OPINIONS and BELIEFS. I MUST. 1. I believe the first crime committed at Columbine was the slaugh­ ter of the children (Harris and Klebold's classmates) by Harris and Klebold. 2. Just as surely I do believe the second\t \"crime\" of Columbine has been the continuing and strong suppression of the informa­ tion and evidence by the Legal System which keeps parents and the public from really ever knowing the truth-or at least having a real opportunity to make judgments as to what the truth is, by having available all the information from which to make judgments."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"3. I believe-as sure as I believe anything on this earth-the claim I made IN A LAWSUIT IN FEDERAL COURT in which I alleged, on behalf of the Columbine children, that the Harris boy's actions, including PARTICULARLY AND ESPE­ CIALLY HIS FINAL ACT OF SUICIDE, were caused or influenced to occur by the antidepressant drugs he was taking. 4. Remarkably enough, within a year or so after I dropped out of this lawsuit and the lawsuit was dismissed by the Federal Judge, IT BECAME PUBLIC INFORMATION AND KNOWLEDGE THAT CERTAIN OF THESE ANTIDEPRESSANTS DO IN FACT CAUSE SUICIDAL BEHAVIOR, PARTICULARLY IN CHILDREN AND TEENAGERS, AND NOW THIS FACT MUST BE PUT ON THE DRUGS WHEN THEY ARE SOLD OR PRESCRIBED TO CHILDREN. But, of course when I had this lawsuit going, none of this information was public knowledge BUT WAS ALL DENIED by the drug companies. And, one of these days-SOON-when I get a legal comfort level to do so without getting punished by the legal system I intend to BLOW IT OUT ALL STRAIGHT ON THE REAL COLUMBINE TRUTHS."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"TABLE OF CONTENTS Chapter I.

Colby and his wife, Sally Shelton Colby, a United States ambassador under President Jimmy Carter, were at that very moment warn­ ing me to get away from the Franklin child abuse investigation, Larry King, and anybody else linked with Franklin, as quickly as possible for the sake of my own life and safety. Sally and Bill had never talked to me like this before. They sat me down, made it clear that this was not one of our routine discussions about life and health and happiness, and empha­ sized to me the serious nature of what and whom I was deal­ ing with. \"What you have to understand, John, is that sometimes there ix"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"x • THE FRANKLIN COVER-UP are forces and events too big, too powerful, with so much at stake for other people or institutions, that you cannot do any­ thing about them, no matter how evil or wrong they are and no matter how dedicated or sincere you are or how much evidence you have. That is simply one of the hard facts of life you have to face. You have done your part. You have tried to expose the evil and wrongdoing. It has hurt you terribly. But it has not killed you up to this point. I am telling you, get out of this before it does. Sometimes things are just too big for us to deal with, and we have to step aside and let history take its course. For you, John, this is one of those times,\" Bill warned, with Sally nodding her head in affirmation. When a caution of this nature comes from someone of the stature and experience of Bill or Sally Colby, you have to take it seriously, even if you do not want to. I had already had warnings enough, that unless I backed off from the Franklin situation, I might be looking at life from a pine box six feet un­ derground. Bill Colby had ample reason to know the seriousness of the Franklin case. In secret, Colby had been hired a few months earlier by the Nebraska Legislature's investigative committee, to look into the single-engine plane crash, in which the Senate's private investigator, Gary Caradori, and his son were killed. \"But Bill,\" I argued, \"somebody has to do something. The problem here is that our institutions of government have been corrupted. If there is a cover-up-and I now absolutely believe there is, even though originally I thought this whole Franklin story had to be a fantasy-then that cover-up can only take place with the cooperation and even the active assistance of some of our key institutions of government, from the courts to the cops, from the highest politicians, to the media representa­ tives, to the wealthiest business leaders of our community and country. \"I can't believe what you are telling me, Bill.

Maybe it will have some message for you. \"Last night I returned from Russia,\" Bill began. Our conversation was taking place shortly before the now infamous August 19, 1991 coup attempt to throw out Gorba­ chov, and the subsequent collapse of the Soviet Union as it had existed since 1917. \"Why was I in Russia?\" Bill explained. \"For meetings in Moscow, to try to work with other world leaders and Russian leaders, privately and quietly, so that when and if a transition of power and a change of government and economic policy occur in Russia, they occur in such a way that it avoids a war. was staying at a hotel located right near Red Square which, as you know, is the most guarded, sacred spot in the Soviet Union.

There were not going to be any parades down Madison Avenue with ticker tape.

We have to keep working at our goal. But we have to be sensible enough, not to risk everything and get ourselves destroyed or killed in the process.

You maybe have to face the fact that you cannot 'right' all the 'unrightable wrongs.' That there really are people too powerful, interests too big; that the rich and the powerful, even when doing evil, can and will succeed and you can do nothing about it at that moment. \"But,\" Bill continued, \"you do the possible, recognize the impossible, and if you are right-and you are, and we both know it-there will be a time when victory will come and the good will triumph over the evil.

On August 8, 1991, she was sentenced to serve nine to twenty-seven years in prison. Owen was indicted for telling a grand jury, before which she testified in 1990, that she was sexually abused as a juvenile, by a Nebraska district court judge, by the chief of police of the city of Omaha, by the manager of the Franklin Community Federal Credit Union, and others. Alisha Owen also witnessed, she said, the abuse of other children by figures in Nebraska's political and financial establishment whom she named, among them the publisher of the state's largest newspaper, the Omaha World­ Herald. She testified that she was in a group of Nebraska children who functioned for years as illegal drug couriers, traveling nationwide, for some of Nebraska's wealthiest, most powerful and prominent businessmen. Two grand juries, one local and one federal, had a mandate to consider these and other charges of child abuse connected with the Franklin Credit Union. They indicted the victim-wit­ nesses for perjury instead! \"This is unprecedented, probably in the history of the United States,\" commented Dr. Judianne Densen-Gerber, a lawyer, psychiatrist and nationally prominent specialist on child abuse, during her visit to Nebraska in December 1990. \"If the children are not telling the truth, particularly if they have been abused, they need help, medical attention. You don't throw them in jail!\" Both grand juries admitted that Alisha Owen and Paul Bo­ nacci, whose testimony extensively corroborated Owen's, had xvii"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"• • • xviii • \" rHE FRANKLIN COVER·UP been badly abused. But this was done, they concluded, by persons other than those the young people named. Bonacci, too, was indicted for perjury. Two other victim-witnesses, whose stories buttressed those of Owen and Bonacci, recanted under immense pressure. Alisha Owen and Paul Bonacci refused to recant. America is suffering an epidemic of child abuse. \"S.O.S. America,\" a 1990 report from the Washington, D.C.-based Children's Defense Fund (CDF), said that \"a survey by the American Association for Protecting Children indicates that 2.2 million children were reported abused, neglected, or both in 1987-a 225 percent increase since 1976, and a 48 percent increase in the previous five years.\" CDF and other estimates caution, however, that only one in every five cases of abuse and neglect gets reported. \"The dimensions of the abuse are staggering,\" Dr. A. Nicholas Groth, director of the sex offender program at the Connecticut Correctional Institute, told the New York Times in 1990, \"If we saw these same numbers of children suddenly developing some kind of illness, we'd think we had a major epidemic on our hands.\" Shocking as the numbers are, the nature of the crimes is more so. Ever more frequently, abuse involves what law enforcement officials refer to as \"sadistic, ritualistic\" features, or, to speak plainly, satanism. What the victims of this type of abuse de­ scribe is so horrific, that parents, teachers, and even child welfare workers have great difficulty to grasp what they are being told. The mind recoils from such evil, inflicted on the most innocent of all people, children. In recent months, news media around the country have been full of propaganda to the effect that children who report abuse are just telling what they fantasized, or stories fed to them by adults. As for satanic or ritualistic abuse, many newspapers declare that it does not even exist, as the New York Village Voice did in a June 1990 article, which attacked \"the great ritualistic abuse hoax.\""},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION • A banner-headline story in the Chicago Tribune of May 17, 1991, \"A chilling tale of child abuse no one can prove,\" gave typical coverage of the debate over whether or not children are being abused by satanists: ' All nine children tell the same story, a grisly tale of being taken out of school and abused in a blue house. They name the same culprit, a school administrator who performs satanic rituals as part of his twisted routine. In the 14 months since the first child came forward, police said they have conducted 150 interviews and cannot substantiate the claims of the children, who range in age from 5 to 9. Prosecutor Stanley Levco is more blunt: He doesn't believe them, and he plans to publicly clear the accused. But the children's enraged parents believe them. And a once-skeptical psychologist also thinks they are telling the truth. All agree the children have been traumatized. The prob­ lem is, no one can prove how. 'In all these cases, I don't know of a single shred of credible, corroborating evidence,' Levco said. . . . The stories of the Evansville children reflect a recent, bizarre trend in child abuse cases across the country. As more children are encouraged to step forward and expose adults who hurt them, police are encountering more cases of child abuse accompanied by allegations of occult rituals. The Tribune cited Kenneth Lanning, the Federal Bureau of Investigation's expert on occult crime, on the virtual non­ existence of ritualistic abuse. Lanning, who has publicized his opinion that \"more people have been killed in the name of Jesus and Mohammed than in the name of Satan,\" said on this occasion, that there had \"been only one criminal conviction stemming from charges of satanic ritual abuse in the U.S.\" On April 28, 1991, the Omaha World-Herald carried a story along these lines, titled \"Satanism ... Lots of Talk, Little Proof.\" It said that the problem was not an epidemic of satanic abuse, but rather, \"authorities say, America is witnessing an epidemic of concern over Satan and his minions, especially among adherents of fundamentalist Christianity. So-called rit­ xix"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"xx • THE FRANKLIN COVER·UP ual abuse is only part of it. But are these stories of incest and human sacrifice true? Many mental health experts think not. And at least two law enforcement officers, with the FBI and the San Francisco police, say they have looked into some of the claims and found nothing.\" (Emphasis added.) An embattled minority of law enforcement officials disagrees with Lanning of the FBI. Ted Gunderson, a 28-year FBI veteran, former special agent-in-charge of the Bureau's Los Angeles Field Division, speaks from his personal knowledge of one of the most infamous recent cases involving ritual abuse, the McMartin pre-school case in California. After a 33-month trial, and despite voluminous evidence against them, school operators Peggy McMartin Buckey and her son, Raymond Buckey, were exonerated in January 1990 on 52 counts of molesting the children in their care, while the jury failed to reach a verdict on thirteen other counts against Raymond Buckey. In a May 25, 1990 interview with Executive Intelligence Review, Gunderson said, \"In the McMartin case, for example, before any criminal charges were filed against anyone, 460 complaints were filed with the Manhattan Beach police. Are we to believe that 460 families fed their children the same story of ritualistic sexual abuse, animal sacrifices, etc.?\" He stressed that the crimes were reported in an affluent suburban area, where residents are typically skeptical about organized child abuse or satanic conspiracies. Gunderson commented on the effect of Lanning's disclaim­ ers: \"In my opinion, other than [satanists active in the United States in the twentieth century] Aleister Crowley, Anton LaVey, and Michael Aquino, Ken Lanning is probably the most effec­ tive and foremost speaker for the satanic movement in this country, today or any time in the past.\" Evidence from Gunderson's investigations has convinced him that tens of thousands of children or young people disappear from their homes each year, and that many are ritually sacri­ ficed. A decade ago, one estimate, printed in Reader's Digest in July 1982, was that \"approximately 100,000 children are unaccounted for\" each year. That number sounds too high, but"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"• • • INTRODUCTION • nobody knows what the true figure is, because the FBI does not keep count. Gunderson observes: \"The FBI has an accurate count of the number of automobiles stolen every year. It knows the number of homicides, rapes, and robberies, but the FBI has no idea of the number of children who disappear every year. They simply do not ask for the statistics. Every month, every major police department in the United States files its uniform crime statistics with the FBI. It would be simple for the bureau to add one more column to the statistics and get a breakdown of every reported case of missing children-not to even mention children who are kidnaped for ritualistic purposes, and, in some cases, murdered. I am convinced that the FBI does not ask for these statistics because they do not want to see them. They would be confronted with an instant public outcry for action, because the figures would show a major social problem. That problem would de­ mand action.\" The Franklin Credit Union scandal, centered in Omaha, opens a window into the hideous world of child abuse, and of organized, illegal drug peddling, patronized and protected by powerful figures in politics and business. National media interest in the case flickered in 1988, when the Franklin Community Federal Credit Union was raided by federal agencies and shut down. Franklin's manager was Law­ rence E. (Larry) King, Jr., then 44, a rising star in state and national Republican circles, an officer of the National Black Republican Council. King sang the national anthem at the GOP national conventions in 1984 and 1988. Nearly $40 million was missing from the coffers of the small, ostensibly community-oriented credit union. The finan­ cial scandal turned into something more, when it became known that children from Omaha and its surroundings said they had been flown from city to city, to be abused at parties held by Franklin's officers and well-known Nebraskans, including nationally prominent Republican Party activists. \"A Lurid, xxi"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"• • • xxii • THE FRANKLIN COVER·UP Mysterious Scandal Begins Taking Shape in Omaha,\" head­ lined the New York Times. Three years later, people living outside eastern Nebraska are unlikely to be aware of the Franklin scandal, and those in the region have been told that the case is closed. Larry King is serving his jail term for misappropriation of funds, after a guilty plea. Law enforcement at the local, state and federal levels said there was no evidence of drug-peddling, organized child abuse, or satanic activity by King. The allegations of child abuse were \"a carefully crafted hoax,\" according to one of the two grand juries that examined the affair. A chief witness, Owen, stands convicted of perjury. The day after Alisha Owen's conviction, 3,000 Nebraskans responded to a local radio station's poll; 94% of them said they believed that she had been railroaded and that there was a cover-up. What the public suspects, the careful investigator of the Franklin case confronts face to face. This case is far from closed. This book will explore the substance of the Franklin case, much of which has never been revealed to the public until now. That means evidence concerning key players, which apparently was never brought before, or was ignored by, the grand juries. It means evidence gathered for the Nebraska Legislature's special committee on the Franklin case, which found and verified the tracks of criminal activity, where law enforcement purported to see none. The legislative investigation, which began in November 1988, ended on January 9, 1991, when a new Legis­ lature was sworn into office, and the investigative committee authorized by the previous Legislature was automatically termi­ nated as required by the state constitution. The Legislature had the option to renew the investigation, but did not; many members knew or suspected what the stakes were, and were terrified.

I knew how high Larry King's reach went; I was sitting in the front row, just fifteen feet from the main podium, at the 1984 and 1988 Republican national conventions, duly elected by the people of the State of Nebraska as a delegate, pledged, in the first instance, to Ronald Reagan and, in 1988, to George Bush. I was there, as the story of the Franklin Credit Union and the child abuse broke in Nebraska. I wrote the \"DeCamp memo\" in 1990, which marked a new phase of the case. I will describe events in which I personally was involved. Most of these have never been made public, and it has pained me tremendously at times, when I knew that the Omaha World-Herald was saying something false or distorting a fact, that I had no forum or no legal right to respond, because I had to protect a client or honor a legal privilege. As an attorney, furthermore, I have some specialization in cases of allegations by youngsters against adults in the area of child abuse. It has been my policy and belief, as it is now, that there is nothing worse than child abuse, with the possible exception of falsely accusing people of child abuse. Just in the past year, I have overturned two felony charges against individuals in rural Nebraska, who were charged with abusing their daughters, based on allegations from the daughters. I was convinced the girls were not telling the truth. I successfully proved this in both cases, and the girls broke down and told the whole story as to why they had lied. In addition, I am the lawyer for the National Child Abuse Defense and Resource Center of Nebraska, which fights against false accusations of child abuse, and is made up of adults who have been falsely accused of child abuse. By contrast with these cases of fantasy, I can say without reservation that in one Franklin-related instance after another, there was sufficient evidence and corroboration available for anyone seeking it, to back up the victims' tales. My own recollections and considered judgments are just a fraction of the huge record of the Franklin case. The files of the Legislature's main investigator, the late Gary Caradori, testify to the mass of leads law enforcement would xxiii"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"xxiv • THE FRANKLIN COVER·UP not pursue. Documentary evidence presented in this book, never before made public, makes it possible to contrast the assurances of local and state officials that there was little or no Franklin-related abuse, with what those agencies had in their own files. The chapters of this book dealing with Franklin are based, apart from my direct experience, strictly on documents avail­ able and documented facts. I do not claim to know the accuracy or veracity of every statement made by every witness or other person, recorded in these documents. I do claim, however, that the statements and the evidence were officially presented exactly as described. Readers can draw their own conclusions, as to what is or is not believable. I have been very careful to present only material and docu­ ments which I can legally and properly, in my opinion, make available. I also must state, that I received none of the Franklin commit­ tee documentation from the committee's chairman, Senator Loran Schmit, other than what I was entitled to as attorney for Paul Bonacci. Some people inevitably will claim, as they did when I issued the DeCamp memo in January 1990, that Senator Schmit, whose private attorney I am, \"leaked\" everything to me. I said then, and I say now, that nothing could be further from the truth. Neither is anything whatsoever from grand jury docu­ ments-some of which I had access to-presented here, be­ cause I am not allowed to disclose this information. I wish I could. I wish everything about Franklin could be made public. Then, the public could judge even more thoroughly about what is true and what is false. I believe that sunshine and exposure of all facts from all agencies that have information about Franklin would establish the truth of the stories of drug abuse, child abuse, pedophilia, abuse of positions of public trust, cover-up by institutions of government, and, most tragic, involvement in this conduct and later cover-up by some of our most respected and wealthiest citizens. I believe that the record must get out into the open, to the extent possible, and that the public has to share the information."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"• • • INTRODUCTION • Otherwise, truth becomes whatever those who control the insti­ tutions of government, and the press, say it is. Benjamin Frank­ lin said, \"Whoever would overthrow the liberty of a nation must begin by subduing the freeness of speech.\" For a textbook example of how this can be done, I would say: Come to Ne­ braska! Watch how when you totally control the press, when you own the press, you can make truth be whatever you want, you can make villains out of heroes, sinners out of saints, and vice versa. In this book, therefore, much of the material has been kept in its documentary form-the words of investigators, state senators, victim-witnesses, parents, police, or FBI, as recorded in police documents, eyewitness reports, testimony to the Legis­ lature, published interviews, and so on. I will allow these docu­ ments to speak for themselves. Spelling and punctuation have been left as they appear in documents, except for minor punctuation changes in transcripts. Interpolations in quoted material are denoted by brackets []. When the name of a victim or other person is not his or her real name, it is marked with an asterisk * the first time it appears. The Franklin case, which has dominated political life in Nebraska for three years, has chilling implications for.the whole United States. The unfinished business of the Franklin investi­ gation is a matter not only of justice for children in one state, but of the lives of untold numbers of children everywhere. Evidence developed from Franklin and King's activities leads into drug-trafficking, money-laundering, pornography, child prostitution, and the kidnaping and sale of children in different parts of the United States, and abroad. The shocking treatment of Alisha Owen and Paul Bonacci by the courts in Nebraska is one give-away, of what a high stake has been wagered on suppressing the Franklin scandal. Members of the state Senate and investigators who sought to discover the truth of the matter, found that out earlier on, in a personal, violent manner. xxv"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"CHAPTER \"NEBRASKA IS DEATH-LACED\" \"If even half of what I have heard is true, this is the biggest thing to ever hit Nebraska,\" Gary Caradori told his wife, Sandie, late one night in August 1989. Although he was exhausted, the new chief investigator for the Nebraska Legislature's Franklin committee did not sleep that night. There was more cause for sleeplessness in the weeks that followed. On September 14, 1989 someone broke into the Cara­ doris' home. By January 1990, Caradori was writing to Nebraska Secre­ tary of State Alan Beerman, \"We-my employees and my­ self-have been followed and questionable situations have arisen during this investigation. Threatening situations have resulted numerous times. Why? Am I too close to something they do not want to become public?\" On April 13, 1990, a repairman from the Executone company reported to Caradori that his phone was tapped, a finding con­ firmed to him by sources inside the phone company. The investigator continued to work, with a growing sense of the importance of his task.On May 29, 1990 Caradori wrote to Franklin committee chairman Loran Schmit. \"To be frank,\" he told the senator, \"it is my opinion that we are the only ones who are seriously working to get this case 'out in the open,' so to speak. I honestly feel that should we terminate this investi­ gation that no further work will be done on it.\" On June 23, 1990, Caradori took a few hours off to attend a barbecue at the Omaha home of Mary Lyons-Barrett.

Arriving in a 1980 white Corvette, Caradori told Concerned Parents president Trish Lanphier he had taken the car out of storage for the day's drive, because his other vehicles had been tam­ pered with, and he was \"sure that no one had ever seen that car.\" He was planning to sell his boat for the same reason, but what he most feared, he told Lanphier, was that someone would tamper with the private plane he often flew. \"It would be so easy to tamper with a plane.\" In early July 1990, Caradori phoned Senator Schmit. \"We've got them!\" he exclaimed about some new evidence he had just developed. \"There's no way they can get out of it now!\" He and his son Andrew would be flying to Chicago for the All-Star Game the weekend of July 7-8, he told Schmit. Caradori was going to do a little investigating on the side and would review the new evidence with the senator, upon his return the following Wednesday. On that Wednesday morning, July 11, 1990, Senator Schmit was in his office, talking with a journalist about the Franklin investigation. He related the numerous threats received by him­ self and Caradori, and Caradori's evaluation of those threats. \"It's unlikely that they would kill you or me, Loran, because that would be too obvious,\" Gary had said once, \"But then again, you never know.\" At about 10:30 a.m., Senator Schmit took a phone call. He listened for a moment, appeared shaken, and said, \"Oh, my God, no!\" After asking a few questions, he hung up, tears in his eyes. \"Gary's dead.\" It happened at 2:30 a.m. on July 11, when Gary and AJ. were flying back to Lincoln, Nebraska from Chicago. A farmer in Lee County, Illinois reported that he saw a flash of light, heard an explosion, and saw a plane plunge to the ground. The Caradoris were killed, the plane's wreckage scattered over three-quarters of a mile. The eyewitness account of a flash of"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"\"NEBRASKA IS DEATH-LACED\" • light and an explosion was on the early edition of television news in Nebraska, but got pulled from subsequent reports, which said that the plane exploded on impact. At the Nebraska statehouse that morning, Senator Schmit talked to reporters, who soon filled his office. \"There were a lot of people in this state who wanted to see Gary dead,\" he charged. \"They got their wish. The question to be answered is whether it was a coincidence.\" Gary's brother Dick Caradori was interviewed by the Lincoln Journal about the many threats Gary had received. \"I know that it weighed a lot on his mind,\" Dick said. \"He always hoped that they just didn't cover it up. He said there was a lot to it and a lot of big names involved and hoped their money wouldn't sweep it under the rug.\" Gary's mother, Mary, told the paper that Gary \"cared dearly about the people involved in the Frank­ lin case. He worked day and night for them.\" Sandie Caradori never received official notification of her husband's and son's deaths. She heard the news from friends, who heard it on the radio. Early the next day, before the bodies were even home from Illinois, the FBI descended on Caradori' s office with a subpoena for all his records. What evidence had Caradori turned up? According to the Lincoln Journal the day after Caradori's death, \"Schmit con­ firmed that Gary Caradori had been trying to obtain pictures that some alleged victims said were taken of them during the period when they were being abused. He also confirmed that Caradori had been told that some of those allegedly involved in child sexual abuse 'had exposed some of the victims to satanic cultism. He was working on places and times.' \" He was also working on leads into Washington, D.C. Mystery surrounded not only the crash of the airplane, but Caradori's whole trip. Gary and A.J. had stayed at the Days Inn Lakefront Motel in Chicago, where both his wife and his associate Karen J. Ormiston had telephoned, asked for him by name, and spoken with him (their phone bills showed the calls), but motel management would tell Caradori's investigative firm there was no record of his ever having stayed there. And if 3"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"4 • THE FRANKLIN COVER-UP there was no record that Caradori had registered at the motel, there was also no record of what phone calls he might have made from Chicago. After months of investigation, the National Transportation Safety Board had not come up with the cause of the crash. My friend Bill Colby, former director of the CIA, commented after he looked into the matter, that the cause would probably never be known. Mary Caradori rendered her own verdict on the deaths of Gary and AJ.: \"My son and grandson were murdered.\" Many Nebraskans echoed her opinion. They have growing grounds for suspicion. From late 1988, when the Franklin case first broke into public view, until mid-1991, at least 15 people associated with the case as investigators, alleged perpetrators, or potential witnesses, died sudden deaths, many of them violent. In December 1990, as Dr. Densen-Gerber prepared to travel to Nebraska at the request of the Legislature's Franklin commit­ tee, she consulted several friends with relevant expertise. One of them was a member of the New York State Police, who warned her, \"Don't go. Nebraska is death-laced.\" Caradori's death cast a pall of terror over the state. Civil rights leader Rev. James Bevel, who visited Nebraska in Octo­ ber 1990 as part of a fact-finding commission, said that he had never seen such terror on people's faces, \"not even on the faces of Mississippi Negroes in the 1950s and 1960s,\" who lived under the threat of lynchings by the Ku Klux Klan. In this atmosphere, Douglas County and federal grand juries indicted victim-witnesses Alisha Owen and Paul Bonacci. The Senate Franklin committee went out of existence on January 9, 1991. On June 21, 1991, Alisha Owen was found guilty, and Douglas County prosecutors dropped the charges against Paul Bonacci. As far as the Nebraska political establishment was con­ cerned, the door on the Franklin case was slammed shut for good. Thousands of Nebraska citizens are concerned that what Gary Caradori uncovered not go with him to the grave. The story of the Franklin Credit Union investigation is intertwined with the systematic cover-up that investigation confronted, from the time of the first cries for help from children six years ago."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2 LARRY KING, A MAN WELL-KNOWN TO CHILDREN The first alarm went off on June 10, 1985, when the Washington County, Nebraska, Sheriffs Department contacted a Nebraska Department of Social Services (DSS) social worker handling the case of Sean*, Sally* and Steve McArthur*. The children were living in foster care with Jarrett and Barbara Webb of Fort Calhoun. The social worker wrote up the call: The Sheriffs department phoned today and stated they have the McArthur children in their custody and they had picked them up from the Webb home due to child abuse complaint. Sean had welts and scratches over parts of his back which he said the Webbs had beat him with a railroad iron and belt. They also had picked up the Webbs' son Joey*, age 16. Joey also complained of being beaten by his parents. . . . Sean said the Webbs have been beating [them] for quite some time and this is not the first time this has happened to them. They were afraid to say anything the other times .... Jarrett Webb worked for the Omaha Public Power District and was a board member of the Franklin Community Federal Credit Union, headed by Lawrence E.

In August, Joey's sister Kimberly Patterson* Webb (age 14) and another brother, Mi­ chael*, ran away, but were returned to the Webbs. In November, Nelly Patterson* Webb, 16, fled to the home of her grand­ mother, Ruby Patterson*. The Fremont office of DSS reported on the reasons, in a document dated December 18, 1985: Our office and a Deputy interviewed Kimberly [who had obtained permission to visit Nelly at their grandmother's] and Nelly separately and together. Both girls stated numer­ ous times that they refuse to go back to the Webbs. . .. Both girls have stated they have received \"whippings\" and \"beatings\" from both Barbara and Jarrett at different times. These started in 1978, approximately eight months after they moved into the Webb home. The girls said they were hit with objects: an extension cord, a belt, a \"black thing,\" (rubber hose) and a \"railroad prop\" (a narrow piece of heavy black rubber approximately two feet long with several holes in each end). Before they were struck, they were made to remove their clothing. They were mainly struck on the back or on the behind, but occasionally on the head or face. Social workers removed Nelly, whose full name was Corne­ lia M. Patterson* Webb, from the Webb home and placed her with foster parents Ron and Kathleen Sorenson in Blair, Nebraska. Soon after this move, she was interviewed at the Washington County Sheriff's Office by State Patrol Investigator Jane F. Tooley. Tooley found out that the abuse was not limited to beatings. Tooley wrote in her report, dated January 30, 1986: She stated that she had been sexually abused. . .. Nelly stated that when she was approximately nine or ten years of age, that Jarrett Webb kissed her for a long time and that she pulled away because she couldn't breathe and it was nasty.

Nelly stated that when she was 10 and 11 years old, at night time when everyone was in bed, Jarrett Webb called her into his room a couple of times. When she didn't come into the room he then told her to come in or he would whip her. ... She stated that Jarrett Webb pulled the sheet down and pulled her on top of him . . . . She stated that she could feel his hair against her leg and knew that he didn't have any underwear on. When Nelly was 15, she told Tooley, Jarrett Webb punished her by ordering her to undress and lie on the bed, and then beating her with a rubber strap. Next, he made her lie on her back, put her legs in the air, and \"he pressed himself between her legs,\" and \"started 'humping her' .... He started beating her again with the strap .... He then started sucking on her breasts. . .. Nelly stated that she started crying and that Webb left.\" When, in February of 1986, the Department of Social Ser­ vices requested immediate and emergency removal of Kendra* and Michael Webb from the Webb home, it listed eight separate concerns, among them: 2) Repeated allegations of physical abuse told to our Department by six children during separate interviews: a) of being struck for long periods of time while naked, by various objects, including a belt, rubber hose, and the \"railroad prop\"; b) denial of meals in the home 3) Sexual abuse of Nelly by Jarrett (supported by a poly­ graph test given to Nelly 1-30-86) 4) The intense concern by the children out of the Webb home for the physical and emotional well-being of the chil­ dren remaining in the home ....

Under DSS rules, this would cut short an investigation into the mistreatment of the girls. Reversing an adoption was not a routine procedure. \"Regard­ ing a relinquishment [of adopted children], the Department does not accept one easily,\" noted one DSS social worker in her log of the Patterson Webb case. The Webbs insisted on it. Social workers recorded that in January 1986, Barbara Webb \"was crying and carrying on,\" inquired about \"allegations\" the girls were making, and wanted \"to get relinquishment over with.\" Negotiations on behalf of the Webbs were conducted by attorney Gary Randall, whose brother Casey Randall was in the orbit of Larry King's Franklin Credit Union; Nelly and Kimberly referred to Casey as \"Larry's maid.\" Gary Randall arranged the relinquishment with the help of the very official who would have handled a criminal prosecution of the Webbs for child abuse, had there been one at that time-Washington County prosecutor Patrick Tripp. In June 1986, in the face of a pattern of gross abuse of children by the Webbs, the state suspended their foster care license. Prosecutor Patrick Tripp again came to the rescue, deciding not to file sexual abuse charges or any other charges against Jarrett or Barbara Webb. Instead of investigating her reports about the Webbs' involvement in pornography and child prostitution, Tripp called Nelly Webb a liar-lie detector tests notwithstanding. Tripp's attitude was recorded by Julie Walters, a youth care worker called on to interview Nelly and Kimberly Patterson Webb in March 1986, because they had described abuse of boys residing at Boys Town, the large orphanage west of Omaha, where Walters was employed. In Walters' fifty-page report on the child abuse described to her by the girls, Tripp figures as an adversary of the children: When presented with Jane Tooley's investigation, Pat Tripp, the Washington County prosecutor, said he didn't believe Nelly and wanted her to take a polygraph test. At his request, Nelly was given four polygraph tests administered by a state trooper at the State Patrol office on Center St. in Omaha."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"• • • A MAN WELL·KNOWN TO CHILDREN • The state trooper, after Nelly's testing was completed, told Kathleen Sorenson he tried to \"break Nelly down\" but he was convinced she was telling the truth. He also told Nelly that she \"passed\" and that he believed her. Although the polygraph tests showed Nelly was not deceptive, Atty. Pat Tripp maintained he still didn't believe what Nelly said. He said Nelly had fantasized those stories to the point that she believed they were true. Tripp's line, that child victims in Nebraska just invent abuses, and that therefore their complaints need not be seriously investigated, would be heard from one law enforcement agency after another, throughout the Franklin case, down to the perjury conviction of victim-witness Alisha Owen. For Pat Tripp, there was a personal element in this case. He was a \"good friend,\" according to foster parents cited in a September 1989 report by legislative Franklin committee inves­ tigator Karen Ormiston, of two individuals named by Nelly and Kimberly Webb as involved with the Webbs-Fort Calhoun Superintendent of Schools Deward Finch and Fort Calhoun High School principal Kent Miller. Between late 1985 and June 1986, thanks to Tripp, the Webbs escaped both a DSS investigation and possible criminal prosecution. Shortly after his refusal to file criminal charges in this case, Tripp quit as Washington County attorney. Today he is a prominent lawyer in Omaha. Well-known as they were, Deward Finch and Kent Miller were small fry compared to another name that appeared in Walters' report, the same person for whom Nelly and Kimberly said Casey Randall was the \"maid\"-Larry King. Walters wrote: While the Webbs were away, the kids snooped through the house. They found: I. pornographic video tapes in a bag under the Webbs' bed (which the kids played on the VCR while Webbs were gone)-one tape specifically showing teenagers involved in sexual activity. Nelly and Kimberly 9"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"10 • THE FRANKLIN COVER-UP knew from eavesdropping that Larry King supplied the Webbs with the video tapes; 2. pornographic magazines in the basement. Once when Sean was suspected of snooping around in the magazines he was not allowed to eat anything at the Webbs' house for one week; 3. box of a lot of \"romantic\" novels in Mrs. Webb's closet (i.e., mothers having sex with their sons); 4. stacks of 8\" x 10\" (approx.) \"photo\" envelopes marked \"DO NOT BEND\" in Mrs. Webb's closet ... ; 5. photos of naked white women in Webbs' bedroom dresser drawer. Walters' report also conveys the Webbs' pricey lifestyle and the involvement of more people, including Larry King, in their activities: Although at the 3/7/86 hearing, Mr. Webb stated that he earns $32,000/year, the Webbs' home is furnished quite expensively ($2,000 paintings, crystal, silver, several VCRs, TVs, etc.). Also, Mrs. Webb wears a four carat diamond ring, a full-length fur coat, all custom-made dresses, expensive accessories. When they throw a party it includes caterers and limousines .... Larry [King] attends meetings/parties at the Omaha Girls' Club ... about every other week. He sometimes invited Joey Webb or Nelly by calling the Webbs and telling them to have one of the kids ready in so many minutes. Nelly said they had no choice about attending these functions. She said she attended only once about 2 years ago (age 14) but Joey attended regularly from the time he was in seventh grade (approx. age 12-13) until he left the Webbs' home (age 16). When Nelly attended she and Larry King went alone in his limo. Other times, Mrs. King and Mr. and Mrs. Webb also attended. Nelly described these functions as lasting about 45 min­ utes. She said she attended one held on a Fri. evening about 7:00 p.m. There were about ten to fifteen older men present and about twenty-five young teenage girls there.

This began about two years ago. Again, Nelly said the kids had no choice about whether or not they would attend. They were driven over to King's with Mr. and Mrs. Webb .... Nelly and Kimberly said they talked with boys at those parties who said they were from Boys' Town .... From [Boys' Town] year book photos, after examining '83, '84 & '85 yearbooks, Kimberly said [four boys] had all attended some of Larry's parties during the summers of '84 and '85. Nelly was afraid to mention any names but earlier had mentioned a \"Brent\" (whose picture she didn't find in the yearbooks), who told her he had left Boys' Town in '84. Brent was \"flown to another city somewhere\" in Larry's private plane to \"work for someone else\" after he and Larry had a disagreement. ... At the parties there are usually about thirty adults present, male & females, more white than black guests because ac­ cording to Larry \"blacks get ignorant when they drink and tighter with their money and whites spend more money when they're drunk.\" Also present were some prostitutes (ages unknown but not teenagers) and [illegible] ages 16-22, and Nelly and Kimberly-about twenty kids total. If a man was interested in a young lady he held out a folded $50 or $100 bill in front of them and whispered something in their ear. Then they went upstairs or to some other area of the house. Nelly and Kimberly said the prostitutes told them they gave half of the money they got to Larry King. Larry also gave some of the boys at these parties new cars. The sexual activity was not always behind closed doors or confined to the upstairs rooms, and sometimes involved more than two people. Couples engaged in sexual activity were same-sex as well as opposite sex .... The money Joey told Nelly and Kimberly he made \"working for Larry\" the Webbs took from him supposedly to keep for him .... The girls talked about Larry King's power to command underage youth to do his bidding: Larry claims to donate money to Boys' Town and be on the Board of Directors at Girls Club.

Nelly said Larry \"has a bad temper.\" Larry also tells the young men they'll get hurt. Julie Walters' write-up contains the most explosive account by the Patterson Webb girls, which marked the pornography and prostitution network they were caught up in as a scandal of national scope. What they told was so awful, that it screamed for immediate investigation. In the course of attempts by law enforcement personnel and, later on, news media to belittle the children's testimony, however, this particular item from Nelly's account would serve the opposite purpose: How can anything she says be believed, the line went, if she says this? The passage in Julie Walters' handwritten report reads as follows: Nelly also accompanied Mr. and Mrs. King and [their son] Prince on trips to Chicago, N.Y. and Washington, D.C., beginning when she was 15 years old. She missed twenty­ two days of school almost totally due to these trips. Nelly was taken along on the pretense of being Prince's babysitter. Last year she met V.P. George Bush and saw him again at one of the parties Larry gave while on a Washington, D.C. trip. At some of the parties there are just men (as was the case at the party George Bush attended)-older men and younger men in their early twenties. Nelly said she has seen sodomy committed at those parties. At other parties during Larry's trips, Larry had local prostitutes (in their 20's & 30's) there to entertain his male guests .... At these parties, Nelly said every guest had a bodyguard and she saw some of the men wearing guns. All guests had to produce a card which was run through a machine to verify the guest was, in fact, who they said they were. And then each guest was frisked down before entering the party. This was not the last time that the name of George Bush would surface in the Franklin affair."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"• • • A MAN WELL·KNOWN TO CHILDREN • After the Patterson Webb girls raised Larry King's name, Julie Walters asked some discreet questions about King of Boys Town employees, and of some people in the north Omaha community. Walters summarized what she was told: \"If you mess with him, you'll get your legs broken.\" \"On the outside he has all the appearances of an upstand­ ing citizen; but underneath he's very dirty.\" \"Omaha has a very large underworld and he's a very powerful man nationally. Maybe he doesn't have all the connections personally but he knows the people who do. . . .

Finch would later be named by two other victim-witnesses as an associate of Larry King. Walters wrote: Kimberly overheard Mrs. Webb tell someone on the phone, \"I got him [Finch] all the way. 1 caught him several times down there with black girls.\" Nelly saw Mr. Finch leave the Webb home once as she returned home from school and Kimberly saw him leave the Webb house several times dur­ ing daytime hours. Kimberly's first period class at school is a study hall which is located across the hall from the school's office. She said Mr. Finch would regularly call the Webbs and say, \"It's time for another meeting.\" Mr. Finch would interrupt whatever he was doing when the Webbs arrived to meet with them, meeting in the school office sometimes for several hours. At some meetings, Kent Miller, principal of Ft. Calhoun H.S., was also present. Mrs. Webb almost always carried a large Gucci bag (almost the size of a shopping bag) with her into these meetings.

King had told the building manager that he was renting the apartment as a place to stay when he worked late, so that he didn't have to travel out to his suburban home.

In a report dated June 30, 1988, Carmean put down more of what he had learned from Loretta: During the course of Reporting Officer's interview with LORETTA ISABEL SMITH concerning child pornography activity, as well as devil worship, she mentioned the name of LARRY KING as being a participant and supporter in these activities.

Stitt explained before the state Legislature's Executive Board, on December 19, 1988, \"[O]ne of the things that you want to keep in mind, as horrifying as this is when you review it, this girl is very concrete about who was present at these homicides, what was happening, dates, she gave a lot of specific informa­ tion and in working with children one of the ways you know this is not a global fantasy is the more details they give you.\" The information given to hospital staff and to the Omaha police by Loretta Smith overlapped and corroborated what was already in the hands of authorities from the children from the Webb household, and from Margo Georgiu and her daughter. From three separate cases, involving pornography, child abuse, and ritual murder, children's testimony and other evidence converged on Larry King."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 4 COVER-UP PHASE THE POLICE In July 1988, Omaha police officers in the Robbery and Sex Unit received an unexpected visit from their boss, Chief of Police Robert Wadman. According to the officers' own account, related by Nebraska Foster Care Review Board official Dennis Carlson in testimony to the Legislature's Executive Board, they took precautions to keep Wadman out of their work on Larry King. Excerpts of Carlson's remarks, from the Executive Board minutes of December 19, 1988, show that the officers feared a police cover-up of King's activities, from within the de­ partment: [Officer Carmean] told me some things which I found to be somewhat startling. I asked if he was interested in informa­ tion regarding Larry King and he said, yes we are, we're conducting what he called a supersensitive investigation of Larry King and he said this investigation was so supersensi­ tive that they were not even using the steno pool in the Omaha Police Department. They were handwriting their police reports, and he also told me that Chief Wadman had come to their unit and directly asked if they were investigating Larry King ....

The investigation of Loretta Smith's charges did not go far, in Wadman's department. Neither did the career of Officer Carmean. On the afternoon of June 28, 1988, immediately after Carmean's interview with Loretta, his supervisor, Sgt. Ken Bovasso, spoke by telephone with Dr. Kay Shilling, Loretta's psychiatrist at the hospital. According to Bovasso's write-up, Shilling told this Reporting Officer that she has spoken with LO­ RETTA SMITH since LORETTA'S discussion with Officer CARMEAN .... LORETTA told DR. SHILLING that she only gave Officer CARMEAN general information, ... [but] that she had no problem talking with Officer CARMEAN. Reporting Officer told DR. SHILLING that sometime during the week of 04 July 1988 this Reporting Officer will assign Officer CARMEAN to revisit Loretta at the hospital in order to build up some rapport and possibly obtain more spe­ cific information. Carmean never came back to interview Loretta Smith again. As Loretta volunteered more horrific, detailed allegations during the summer, Richard Young Hospital and FCRB person­ nel were concerned about the lack of police interest. Dennis Carlson recalled, in his Executive Board testimony: Loretta was making more allegations against Larry King and others and these were allegations of the most serious nature. She was reporting that she had witnessed homicides. Investigator Carmean was contacted by myself on one, possi­ bly two or three, occasions ....

Investigator Carmean and Investigator Hoch left my office and they seemed sincere, they seemed that they were going to investigate these allegations and later it was as if air had been let out of a balloon, that all of a sudden they had no interest in even re-interviewing a girl who was saying that she had witnessed homicides and I just don't understand it. ... FCRB Executive Director Carol Stitt testified: I would like to add something that was highly unusual in this case.

All those people had made contact and nothing was being done .... Not long after after his interview with Loretta, Officer Carmean was transferred out of investigations altogether, into a section called Research and Planning. At the same Executive Board meeting, Senator Ernie Chambers recounted a phone conversation with Carmean: When I called [the sexual assault unit], they said he's no longer here and that's when they told me that he was with Research and Planning .... I finally ... got him and I men­ tioned his enthusiasm at the outset, and that from what I had developed in terms of creditable information being given to me, I felt he'd been transferred because he was getting too close to something and his superiors did not want him to continue.

I've known of Carmean for years and he's not the type of officer who'd want to be put into an office where he's the only one there, in fact that might have been the creation of the department. Didn't even have a secretary. Carmean himself testified before the legislative Franklin committee in June 1989, that, although he had been pulled off the case, he thought Loretta's charges were \"credible\" and deserved follow-up. Less than two weeks later, on July 5, 1989, Chief Wadman tried to get Carmean declared crazy. In a lengthy \"Inter-Office Communication\" to Omaha Public Safety Director Pitmon Fox­ all (a cousin of Larry Kingl), Wadman announced that Carmean needed a mental health evaluation: I am requesting a supervisory referral for Officer Irl Carmean to see police psychologist Dr. Steven Sherrets. I am basing this request on the actions demonstrated by Officer Carmean that surfaced during the Larry King investigation .... Prior to Officer Carmean's assignment with Research and Planning, he was serving as an investigator with the Robbery and Sex Unit under the command of Lt. Guy Goodrich. While in that assignment, Officer Carmean was involved as an investigator and did participate in looking into matters involving allegations that Larry King was involved in some sexual improprieties with young people. The investigation never did come close to supporting the allegations suffi­ ciently for a charge to be considered against Larry King. One other Omaha policeman who was reported to have kept a file on Larry King, Officer Bill Skoleski, died of a heart attack.

In April 22, 1989 interviews with King and Wadman, Frank Brown of TV-7, Omaha, ques­ tioned them about an incident in which Wadman intervened at King's request, to order the release of a suitcase seized in a drug raid. BROWN: King acknowledges he is a friend of Chief Wad­ man's. We asked King did he call the chief to get a suitcase released that had been seized in a drug investigation? BROWN: You had that friendship where, you could .... Yes. BROWN: You could call the Chief of Police and get a piece of evidence released? I felt that I could call anyone in this city. BROWN: What was that suitcase? I've always wondered what was in that suitcase and what was it about? Urn, it's really nothing. It was a relative of mine and he was staying at a hotel, and I guess they had a drug bust or something ....

Switching back to Larry King, Brown raised another question about a smooth ride he seemed to have gotten from the OPD: BROWN: The Omaha Police had an investigation last summer into an alleged pornographic ....

WADMAN: We had a situation where we were advised that there was a possibility of child pornography involving-no, it came in as child pornography case. What happened is that there was a photographer who was taking photographs of young women, and in the course of that set of circumstances, a mother with her daughter called and filed a complaint with the police department, and the complaint involved a situation where her daughter was approached by the photographer to be photographed, and the photographer extended an invita­ tion to this young woman's mother to come with her. They went to the studio; photographs were taken; and in the course of that the mother became concerned over the photographs and some of the photographs that she observed at the photo studio and then filed a complaint of concern that this was a possible pornographic situation. We investigated it, found the photographer to be, you know, legitimately involved in the photography business, legitimately involved in conducting the photographs, and getting signed releases and having a photography studio and so on. The only involvement is that this individual had subleased his studio or apartment from Larry King, and that was the extent of our investigation into pornography-related activi­ ties involving Mr. King in any direct way.

The Nebraska Foster Care Review Board, which is not a law enforcement agency and is not equipped to investigate crimes, let alone prosecute them, in 1988 found itself by default the main recipient of reports of abuse from children and from case workers, which attested to the existence of an organized child exploitation ring in Nebraska, and stretching far beyond. Expressing frustration and alarm that the Omaha Police had failed to investigate reports of child murders and other serious crimes, even after many urgent phone calls from personnel at Richard Young Hospital, FCRB Executive Director Carol Stitt on July 13, 1988 met with Nebraska's Republican governor, Kay Orr, to seek help. Governor Orr told her to \"do whatever is necessary\" to secure an investigation. On July 20, Stitt wrote to Attorney General Robert Spire, to request that his office, the state's top prosecuting agency, enter the case. For the first time, somebody openly pulled together the testimony of Nelly Patterson Webb, Loretta Smith, and other children, whose reports of abuse all cited Larry King. \"Pursuant to the Nebraska Child Abuse Statutes, the State Foster Care Review Board is making a report of allegations of a child exploitation ring and respectfully requests an investi­ gation,\" wrote Stitt. She noted that in December 1987, FCRB had reviewed the allegations about a child prostitution ring centered on the Webb family's foster home. Then: On 5/17/88, the Foster Care Review Board received a phone call from Kirsten Hallberg ... who is a previous employee 33"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"34 • THE FRANKLIN COVER-UP of Uta Halee Girls Village and currently works for Richard Young Psychiatric Hospital in Omaha.

She also reports that at a recent child exploitation conference in Kansas City a detec­ tive from Kansas City ... asked her when the Nebraska authorities were going to do something about Larry King. On 7120/88, Kirstin Hallberg reported a 15-year old girl at Richard Young who is talking about inappropriate activity with Larry King and also is alleging witnessing a murder of a young boy who said he was going to tell of the abuse he suffered. Along with the letter, the Foster Care Review Board turned over its entire file on these cases to the attorney general. Spire assured the FCRB that he would do everything in his power to help, and assigned the case to one of his top assistants, Bill Howland. As months dragged by with little apparent action by the attorney general, Stitt and Dennis Carlson demanded a meeting with Howland, which was held in his office on November 22, 1988. Stitt described the meeting to the Legislature's Executive Board, on December 19, 1988: When Dennis and I were in this meeting it became clear to me that if Mr. Howland had ever read the materials we delivered to him in July, it was a long time ago.

Her fellow Executive Board member Burrell Williams added: I think we became really baffled and puzzled on what was going on when you get all this information in front of you and nothing had, [or] is being done about it. Dennis Carlson was also puzzled: I ... don't know what if anything either the Omaha Police Department or the Attorney General's office actually did . . . . If I were doing that investigation, the first thing I would have done with that information is contacted Loretta Smith who's making allegations that she had witnessed homicides, not a homicide, it's homicides .... I ... talked to Loretta Smith's case worker at Richard Young Hospital on Novem­ ber 22 and she told me that the last person that interviewed Loretta was Officer Carmean and that took place on June 28, 1988. On November 30, 1988, Stitt again attempted to contact the governor, to set up a still more urgent meeting, because of the failure of the attorney general's investigation to get off the ground. The governor's staff scheduled a meeting for the fol­ lowing week, but canceled the appointment the next day. The governor, according to her office, was \"not willing\" to meet, as Carlson recorded in his daily notes of December 1. In the November 22, 1988 meeting, Howland once again claimed he would do everything he could, a claim undercut by the attitude of the governor. The Attorney General's Office put one investigator, Thomas Vlahoulis, on the case part time, but, as the Legislature's Franklin committee was to learn on lime 22, 1989, he did next to nothing. In this transcript of his legislative testimony, Vlahoulis is questioned by committee counsel.

COUNSEL: Now, the conclusion I draw, after reviewing that information, is that you really didn't do anything between July and late November, except to collect some extraneous pieces of information about Mr. King's business interests and perhaps about ... his wife's citizenship status. That's my conclusion from reading the reports. On December 20, 1988, Attorney General Robert Spire was quoted in the Lincoln Journal saying that his office had \"acted promptly and professionally\" on all the \"sensitive information\" received on child abuse six months earlier. Yet the Nebraska State Patrol, the agency that would be called upon by the attorney general in such an investigation, conducted its very first investigative meeting on the case on December 19, 1988, the day Spire was boasting to the Lincoln Journal about his alacrity! In the face of official inaction, Carol Stitt and the medical personnel responsible for treating Loretta Smith grew con­ cerned about her safety. She had already been threatened, and the new charges she was making put her in even more danger. Stitt turned to still another agency, the Douglas County (Omaha and surroundings) Attorney's Office, and requested a protective order for Loretta. When the Douglas County attorney filed the order, however, it said that Loretta was making bizarre statements, that she had been on the streets for two weeks, and that she was suicidal! Not only were these allegations untrue, but they could help ensure that Loretta be discredited in any future court appearance. The order had an even graver implication, as Senator Cham­ bers observed during Stitt's December 19, 1988 testimony to the Executive Board of the Legislature.

SENATOR CHAMBERS: Now this is some information that I have and maybe you don't, are you aware that Lynne [sic] Crnkovich has had information given to her by certain pro­ fessionals about some of the things that these youngsters have been talking about and making allegations and she chose to do nothing.

Vlahoulis, the part-time sleuth from the Attorney General's Office, later told Franklin committee investigators about an­ other time Loretta ran afoul of Crnkovich. According to Vla­ houlis' conversations with Crnkovich in January 1989, Father Val Peter of Boys Town \"had been approached by Loretta Smith and ... she complained to him that the F.B.1.and Crnkovich had intimidated her to such an extent while she was at Richard Young Hospital that she had not provided them with all the information that she knew.\" At the December 19, 1988 Executive Board meeting, Senator Loran Schmit asked Carol Stitt what effect the gross mishan­ dling of her case might have on Loretta Smith. Stitt answered, \"I'd like to say if the State continues to handle the case the way they've handled it, everything that this perpetrator has told them is being reinforced.

To understand how this could be, requires a good look at state politics during the mid­ 1980s, especially the Robert Kerrey administration of 1983­ 1987. Early in the decade, the signs went up, billboard-size with flashing neon lights, that Nebraska was now, more than ever, a \"wide open state,\" to use the terminology of the organized crime-controlled political machines in various parts of the United States during the 1920s and 1930s. Mafia control in those days was so tight in some cities, that opposition newspa­ per editors were gunned down in broad daylight. A June 1991 article in the Minneapolis Star- Tribune recalled, about the history of Minnesota, \"Alvin Karpis, onetime Public Enemy No.1, once said, 'Every criminal of any importance in the 1930s made his home at one time or another in St. Paul. ... If you were looking for a guy you hadn't seen in a few months, you usually thought of two places-prison or St. Paul. If he wasn't locked up in one, he was probably hanging out in the other.' \" In order for the city to have this status, veteran St. Paul Pioneer Press reporter Nate Bomberg has said, \"Every­ body was in on the take.

That was when the state seized Commonwealth Savings, forc­ ing its owners, the Copple family, to ante up any and all company and personal assets to help redeem depositor losses. It was the first year of Bob Kerrey's term as governor of Nebraska. The case haunts Kerrey to this day. In 1990, as the price tag for cleaning up failed savings and loan institutions nationwide soared into the hundreds of billions of dollars, one of the loudest critics ofthe Bush administration's handling of the matter was freshman Senator Bob Kerrey, Democrat of Nebraska. An Omaha World-Herald headline cap­ tured the clashes: \"Kerrey, Fitzwater Trade Allegations Over Handling of S&L Crisis.\" White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater cautioned Kerrey that as many Democrats as Republi­ cans were involved in the S&L fiasco, and then admonished him in personal terms. According to the July 16-22, 1990 Omaha Metro Update, Fitzwater \"added that if Senator Kerrey is bent upon making S&L a campaign issue, it's one that could work against Kerrey. The White House apparently has some files on Commonwealth Savings and State Security Savings, but no details were given.\" The mentioned institutions were two of Nebraska's largest industrial banks. They collapsed in 1983 and 1984, shortly after Kerrey's election as governor. Kerrey knows about his vulnerability. Soon after the ex­ change with Fitzwater, the senator got himself interviewed by a friendly World-Herald reporter, to come clean about the events of 1983-84. Under the headline \"Kerrey: My Errors in Insolvencies Will Not Diminish S&L Scrutiny,\" he admitted what he had fiercely denied at the time-that his key adviser on the Commonwealth and State Security crises was his close friend, business associate, and chief financial adviser, Bill Wright. \"Regarded by some as one of the cleverest and most ambitious financial operators in the state,\" according to a bro­ 39"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"40 • THE FRANKLIN COVER·UP chure from the Lincoln-based Concerned Citizens for Responsi­ ble Government, Wright was also a major shareholder and the president of State Security Savings. This relationship, Kerrey now said, may have led to \"appearances of impropriety,\" but this all happened because \"I was new to politics.\" For informed Nebraskans, Kerrey's confession was a bomb­ shell, as the Metro Update observed: \"But what Kerrey-faced with the absolute imperative to get his own past behind him if he is to have any credible role in the Democratic pursuit of President Bush's handling of the national savings and loan scandals-told [World-Herald reporter] Kotok is breathtaking in implication. It is especially so for those whose depth of knowledge takes in the entire fabric of the Kerrey Administra­ tion: Commonwealth Savings Co., State Security Savings, Ker­ rey's own panoply of private business dealings, and, finally, the creation and uses of the Nebraska Investment Finance Au­ thority.\" According to information published in the Metro Update and other documentation, those implications are that Kerrey and Bill Wright used the powers of state government to: 1) loot State Security's depositors of at least $4 million and as much as $10 million, 2) deprive the depositors of Common­ wealth of at least $40 million, 3) set up a new state agency, with the sole apparent purpose of giving Kerrey and his cronies millions of dollars in low interest loans, 4) cheat farmers out of $200 million in subsidized loans, and 5) peddle junk bonds to investors who thought they were getting high-grade state bonds. The voluminous evidence of these activities can be found in a 1986 state Senate investigation, which I chaired, of the failures of State Security and an Omaha bank, the American Savings Company; in 1988 brochures of the Concerned Citizens for Responsible Government; in the Omaha Metro Update of July 16-22, 1990; in a set of three tightly documented reports submitted to the Nebraska Legislature in 1990 by a group of depositors from the failed Commonwealth bank, led by Reuben Worster of Lincoln and veterinarian Dr. Melvin Bahensky of Grand Island; and in a 1991 tort claim filed by myself as attorney and on behalf of Commonwealth depositors."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"• • • DESTRUCTION OF COMMONWEALTH SAVINGS • According to his own account, Bob Kerrey entered politics to make money. In September 1981, as he was contemplating a run for the Nebraska governorship, Kerrey lamented to busi­ nesswoman Dana Saylor Robinson, that in business, \"You have to know someone or cater to this or that politician, to get anything. The only way you are going to be able to make any money is to be in politics.\" The record shows that, with the advice of financial genius Bill Wright, Kerrey fulfilled his ambition at the expense of the citizens of Nebraska. Late one night in the last week of 1982, Democratic Gover­ nor-elect Kerrey and Bill Wright summoned Republican Paul Amen, the state banking director, to a meeting to ask him to stay on in the new administration. Anticipating the request, Amen brought with him \"our highly confidential, secret, sensi­ tive list of problem institutions,\" as he later told my legislative committee when we were looking into the State Security and American Savings failures. High on the list were Commonwealth Savings, controlled by Lincoln businessman S.E. Copple and his son Marvin, and State Security, whose president and leading stockholder was none other than Bill Wright. In 1986, testifying before my committee, Amen was asked if he hadn't felt a little strange showing the governor this list in the presence of Wright, whose own bank was on it. Amen replied, \"No, Senator Harris, I didn't even think in terms of that. I thought in terms of the fact that Bill Wright was the Governor's principal adviser and the Governor had wanted him present at the particular meeting.\" Wright was a prominent lawyer in Lincoln, a member of a wealthy, established family, and one of the rising stars in Ne­ braska politics during the 1970s. State Security, which he and associates acquired in 1978, in a highly leveraged buyout, had made many loans to businessman Bob Kerrey. Wright became the guiding force behind Kerrey's gubernatorial campaign, 41"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"42 • THE FRANKLIN COVER·UP headed his transition team, and served as the governor's per­ sonal counsel. His law firm, Wright, Rembolt, and Ludtke, soon became official adviser to the Nebraska State Banking Department. On October 31, 1983, while Banking Commissioner Amen was on the East Coast negotiating for a purchaser to buy the troubled Commonwealth bank, Governor Kerrey suddenly is­ sued a late-afternoon press release which said, \"We are monitor­ ing the activities of Commonwealth; we are looking at that institution with more interest than we are the other institutions which we monitor.\" The next morning, panicked citizens mobbed the bank. State authorities shut its doors by the afternoon. According to a release from Concerned Citizens for Responsible Government, \"In the Lincoln Star of November 1, [1983] Kerrey himself was quoted as saying that he was barred by law from publicly indicating how serious the Commonwealth situation might be. That is to prevent a public official from creating a run on a financial institution. Yet, by his own words on television and in the newspapers, Kerrey caused exactly that result.\" Commonwealth could have filed for reorganization under the bankruptcy code, to protect its depositors in the wake of the run. But Kerrey forestalled that action by securing a legal opinion from his appointees at the State Banking Department's legal counsel-Bill Wright's law firm-that bankruptcy should not be allowed, but that the state should seize the bank. By statute, Commonwealth also should have had ten days to find new capital, before being seized. The bank had at least two offers-the one Amen was working on, and one from a local group of investors. S.E. Copple was willing to sell his control­ ling stock in the bank to this local group for $1, in return for an infusion of $8-10 million in capital, in order to save the bank. The bank, as Commissioner Amen later testified to the Legislature, would have been saved. Some $50 million of depositors' funds would have been preserved as well. But Kerrey's press release, the resulting run, and the governor's refusal to allow Commonwealth to be purchased after its sei­ zure, preempted that possibility."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"• • • DESTRUCTION OF COMMONWEALTH SAVINGS • The failure of Commonwealth, the biggest collapse of a financial institution in the history of Nebraska, was a human tragedy of major proportions. Many of its depositors were elderly people, who had their life savings in Commonwealth. When it collapsed, some of them were left without even money to buy food. By 1991, eight years after the collapse, one-third of the depositors have died. Many of them died from heart attacks or strokes, within the first 90 days after their bank's doors were shut. Seven families with retarded children had put their life savings in the bank, to care for the children after the parents die; that money was all gone. Kerrey claimed to have great compassion for Common­ wealth's depositors, but his actions spoke otherwise. Throughout 1983, the State Banking Department pressured Commonwealth president S.E. Copple to put up over $8 million of his personal assets and those of his son Marvin, to secure unsecured loans that Commonwealth had taken from other banks. In one instance, a multi-million dollar property got pledged, to secure an approximately $750 thousand loan. These were debts to, among others, Bill Wright's State Security Sav­ ings and the National Bank of Commerce, owned by Kerrey's associate Jim Stuart. Now, after seizing Commonwealth, Ker­ rey's administration pressured the 88-year-old man to dispose of whatever personal assets he had left, including his residence, to \"pay back depositors.\" The bulk of Copple's substantial assets, however, were no longer available to the depositors. They had already been taken by Kerrey's friends. The Copple family was descended from some of the first pioneers in Nebraska. It had a tradition of fierce independence from the state's financial establishment, whence Kerrey re­ ceived campaign funding. The Copples' bank had been a source of liquidity for farmers and small and medium-sized entrepre­ neurs. When Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker doubled interest rates to nearly 20%, in the fall of 1979, many Nebraska banks, including Commonwealth, landed in trouble. But there 43"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"• • • 44 • THE FRANKLIN COVER-UP was a decision to attack the Copples, while sparing institutions tied to Kerrey. The brouhaha over Commonwealth's collapse diverted atten­ tion from State Security Savings, which Amen testified had been in worse shape than Commonwealth. State Security escaped the kind of pressure applied to the Copples. Rather, Kerrey's permission for State Security to remain open until July 9, 1984 made possible its \"milking and draining\" by Bill Wright and other bank officers, in the words of our 1986 Senate investiga­ tion. (That investigative report was unanimously adopted by all members of the legislative committee by which it was prepared, Republicans and Democrats alike, including some of Governor Kerrey's previously staunchest supporters.) Then, State Security was allowed to file bankruptcy, contrary to the standard set for Commonwealth by Wright's law firm via the State Banking Department. Wright's double standard was glaring. It was Wright, who took State Security intofederal bankruptcy, which shielded it from possible attempts by local officials to investigate its affairs or to protect depositors. Yet Bill Wright's law firm, acting as official adviser to the Banking Department, had prohibited that same course from being fol­ lowed by Commonwealth, by issuing its opinion that such a declaration of bankruptcy by Commonwealth would be illegal. At the age of 88, S.E. Copple was stripped of everything he owned, sent to prison, and died a pauper, while Bill Wright quietly moved out of Nebraska, into a million-dollar mansion in Rancho Santa Fe, California. While he was closing down Commonwealth, Bob Kerrey made money on business deals arranged by the institution he allowed to remain open, State Security. On April 5, 1983, the governor, Wright and others formed a partnership called American Investment Group. The chief purpose of AIG was to acquire a choice block of Lincoln real estate, the Shoppers Fair shopping center. This business opportunity resulted from a maneuver by State Security. Bill"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"DESTRUCTION OF COMMONWEALTH SAVINGS • Wright's bank had loaned businessmen Jerry Joyce and Robert Rentfro, the owners of Shoppers Fair, millions of dollars for other projects. It threatened to foreclose on all those loans, unless Joyce and Rentfro sold Shoppers Fair for a million dollars below its assessed value. When Joyce and Rentfro pre­ pared to sue, State Security looked for another arrangement. Ultimately, Shoppers Fair was delivered to the Kerrey group, in return for State Security writing off $3 million of Joyce/ Rentfro debts. State Security financed the purchase by AIG with a loan at 4% under the prime rate. The $3 million write-off of Joyce/Rentfro loans and the new below-prime loan to enable AIG to acquire Shoppers Fair, relieved State Security's depositors of substantial funds. Those depositors lost millions in other financial swindles, which reveal the brutality of the Kerrey group's actions, master­ minded by Bill Wright. Wright and others gained control of State Security in 1978 by purchasing its stock, through a holding company they owned, with a very preferential loan from First National Bank of Lincoln (FirsTier Bank, after its 1984 merger with Omaha National Corporation); the loan required no per­ sonal guarantee and carried no personal obligation, meaning that if it went \"bad\" and the company folded, Wright and his partners had no obligation to repay. Ultimately, they did not repay it. Having gained control of State Security, they sold its most valuable asset, a downtown Lincoln office building, to them­ selves (using a disguised corporate name) for one fourth of its actual value. Since the depositors really owned the equitable value of the building, this transaction alone robbed them of a small fortune. Adding insult to injury, Kerrey's friends then effectively sold the building back to the selfsame depositors, using a long-term lease. The new owners leased it to them at the actual value, four times higher than what they had just paid for the building! On May 28, 1986, with the statute of limitation on prosecu­ tion for these activities about to expire, several members of the Legislature's investigative committee wrote to Banking Director James Barbee and Attorney General Robert Spire, 45"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"46 • THE FRANKLIN COVER·UP \"We urge you to consult immediately with the appropriate law enforcement authorities to determine whether criminal prosecu­ tion is warranted.\" Nothing was done.

As a member of the investigative committee, privy to details that showed just how sordid the affair was, even she had had enough. The senators subpoenaed Spire and other Kerrey-appointed officials, who stated that it was their prerogative to prosecute or not, and they chose not to. We called Kerrey himself as a witness, and instructed him to bring his personal financial statements. According to the Metro Update, \"Kerrey said he resented the request for his bank records. He parried the request by saying that the committee was essentially saying, 'It is OK if your banker tells us everything they know about you.' Kerrey eventually did consent to appear before the committee. Highlights included his denial of im­ proper influence by William F. Wright. Key decisions of the administration were based upon advice from the Department of Banking [whose counsel was Wright's law firm] and other official channels, Kerrey testified.\" Kerrey's AIG deal was already a scandal when it transpired, in 1983. Talking about his business affairs to my legislative committee in 1986, the governor claimed that he had taken every politician's routine precautions: \"I prepared and executed a business trust that naturally moved all the assets physically that I owned, all the business assets, away from even indirect control.\" But somehow this did not prevent Kerrey from person­ ally signing the papers to set up AIG. If it was supposed to be a typical blind trust, to shield a public official from knowl­ edge of how his assets are being managed, Governor Kerrey's trust had at least one eye open. Metro Update described it,"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"• • • DESTRUCTION OF COMMONWEALTH SAVINGS • \"Kerrey's blind trust: It was his sister, Jessie, and her husband, Dean Rasmussen, Kerrey's very active partner in Prairie Life, the restaurants and other business deals. How can you have a blind trust with a bunch of partners you see maybe every day? You maybe eat dinner with them. Or they come over from time to time?\" In November 1983, Kerrey acted quickly to shield himself and his associates from investigation during the uproar over the collapse of Commonwealth. On November 5, 1983, news media reported what was an apparent leak from administration sources, that Republican Attorney General Paul Douglas, who normally would have handled the Commonwealth investiga­ tion, was involved in improper Commonwealth loans. Douglas was a long-standing friend of the Copples. With impeachment proceedings under way, Douglas resigned. Kerrey replaced Douglas as attorney general with his own man, Robert Spire. (Today, Spire serves as U.S. Senator Ker­ rey's chief of staff.) To oversee the Commonwealth investiga­ tion, he named a new special assistant attorney general, David Domina, formerly a law clerk in Bill Wright's law firm! On November 15, 1983, Kerrey fired Banking Director Paul Amen and replaced him with John Miller, whom he had ap­ pointed to the State Liquor Control Commission in June. Miller admitted he had no knowledge of the banking business, telling the press, according to the Metro Update, \"I can't even balance my checkbook.\" The Legislature's Banking, Commerce, and Insurance com­ mittee, then chaired by this writer, Senator John DeCamp, was prepared to investigate the Commonwealth collapse, which came under its purview. But Kerrey handpicked a special new committee for the job. In a November 21, 1983 letter to the governor, I protested Kerrey's actions: \"Governor, it would be most unfair and unreasonable to expect your own people, Mr. Domina, Mr. Miller and yourself, for example, to investigate yourselves since you are the administration officials in charge 47"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"48 • THE FRANKLIN COVER-UP of the Banking Department and since the Attorney General's office is the attorney with the responsibility of providing the legal guidance to the Banking Department and to you.\" The ostensible investigation by this made-to-order commit­ tee turned out as expected. A 1990 report to the Legislature by Reuben Worster of Lincoln and other Commonwealth depos­ itors characterized its findings: \"The conclusion of the Domina Report was filled with speculation and 'Who Dunits' and the final analysis determined that Kerrey was an innocent by­ stander, Amen and [his assistant in the Banking Department] Lake exercised poor judgment, and Douglas was guilty of a multitude of crimes surrounding the failure of the financial insti­ tution.\" Although Commonwealth had been looted before its col­ lapse, Worster's group charged that post-seizure actions planned by Kerrey were even more egregious. In their three­ volume report, these Commonwealth depositors argued that Kerrey had tried to establish, through changes in law and per­ sonnel, the ability to devalue Commonwealth's assets by 50% and then sell them to individuals of his choice, with loans financed by a new, Kerrey-appointed agency, the Small Busi­ ness Development Authority. Although this alleged scheme attributed to Kerrey bogged down in legislative resistance, Commonwealth assets did get inexplicably devalued by 54%, and did wind up in the hands of Stuart and other Kerrey­ connected creditors, Worster's group has charged. Commonwealth depositors got paid only $8.5 million by the state, against their $50 million in losses. There was no reason for them to have lost a nickel. The bank had assets, mainly in real estate, then valued at $50-60 million. The Commonwealth property at 40th & Old Cheney in Lincoln, for instance, would have been worth $35 million if properly developed, according to an estimate given in 1985 by state-appointed receiver John Queen, in front of depositors' representative Dr. Breiner and attorney John Robinson. At the fire sale after Kerrey's liquida­ tors devalued Commonwealth's assets, choice properties, such as 40th & Old Cheney and the Commonwealth Building, went to Jim Stuart's National Bank of Commerce."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"• • • DESTRUCTION OF COMMONWEALTH SAVINGS • On another project to make millions from the creation of a new state body, the Kerrey clique evidently had more success. The Omaha Metro Update of July 16-22, 1990 summarized the case: In 1982, the fortunes of Prairie Life Center, [businessman] Kerrey's planned sports center in Lincoln, were at a low ebb. His managers were saying in published accounts in the Lincoln press that the project was dead. It would not fly, they said, because interest rates made it financially impossible. It was announced that subscribers to membership had their downpayments refunded. But then it was 1983 and a miracle. Kerrey was in as governor, Wright was his trusted, closest financial adviser. Kerrey's announced highest governmental priority became the creation of NIFA [Nebraska Investment Finance Author­ ity], the very body that could breathe new life into Prairie Life. Three public agencies that had been lending money in the areas of agriculture, home building, and industry were to be consolidated into one, into NIFA, which was to be created as a new public authority. And there was one additional area of lending; loans could now be made to commercial enterprises. Suddenly, Kerrey's enterprise, Prairie Life, which couldn't fly in 1982, could soar in 1983. Suddenly, it became economically feasible. The senator and his partners got a loan of $2.55 million, some 4 percentage points under the going rate .... After the bill to set up NIFA passed, Kerrey appointed all nine members of its board, including Bill Wright. One of NI­ FA's very first loans was to Prairie Life. Four days after ap­ proval of this loan to Kerry's project, Lancaster County Repub­ lican Chairman Randy Moody wrote to Senator Yard Johnson, chairman of the Legislative Council Executive Board, about the obvious conflicts of interest. \"This insider deal seems a slap in the face of the taxpayers and business community of the state of Nebraska,\" Moody wrote. \"It's obvious the governor 49"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"• THE FRANKLIN COVER·UP has taken advantage of his elected position to line his pockets and he, his sister and brother-in-law [partners in Prairie Life] are laughing all the while.\" Metro Update reporter Bob Hoig also came to me with some questions about NIFA: This writer went to former Sen. John DeCamp, who spear­ headed NIFA into existence in 1983 as head of the Banking Committee. What, the Omaha Metro Update asked Def.arnp, has NIFA acomplished that it could not have accomplished as three separate agencies, even if the agencies had to be amended in some way, except to make the type of loan that went to Kerrey and his partners and that, of course, allowed Kerrey to appoint the original board? DeCamp said he could think of nothing. DeCamp is a Republican. He was once close to Kerrey but he said they are not close now. He knows NIFA as well as any legislator, past or present. And he can think of no reason for its existence other than to make a new class of loan and to allow Kerrey to appoint its board. In 1986, NIFA marketed a $200 million bond issue, for the avowed purpose of funding low-interest loans to Nebraska's distressed farmers. Kerrey negotiated a deal with New York­ based junk bond peddlers Drexel Burnham Lambert, for Execu­ tive Life Insurance Company of California to market the issue. (Executive Life failed in 1991 due to its Drexel-linked losses.) Drexel and associated firms earned their fat fees, the value of the bonds collapsed, and not one dollar out of the $200 million ever reached a Nebraska farmer! According to a federal law suit filed in April 1990 by holders of the devalued bonds, the main purpose of the financing was never to provide funds to farmers, but to provide \"inexpensive funds to Executive Life for reinvestment, .. in junk bonds .... \" While the actions of Kerrey and his associates outraged legislators and tens of thousands of depositors who suffered, there was deafening silence from Nebraska's major press, the Omaha World-Herald, the Lincoln Journal, and the Lincoln Star, The Metro Update of July 16-22, 1990 gave some insight into why: so"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"• • • DESTRUCTION OF COMMONWEALTH SAVINGS • John Gottschalk, an important World-Herald figure in the business sense since 1975 and publisher of the newspaper since last January, has invested through his daughters in Kerrey's ventures since Kerrey's earliest days in business in the early 1970s. The daughters, now ages 15 and 23, own a $50,000 share in the Prairie Life Center in Omaha. As for the Lincoln Journal-Star, one of its three board mem­ bers since 1981 has been Bill Wright. From covering up financial swindles, it was a short step to covering for prominent businessmen who were involved in organized drug peddling or for politicians and publishers with a weakness for young children. Reviewing the Commonwealth case and the Franklin Credit Union scandal side by side, it is striking how the casts of characters overlap. Key personnel in the Kerrey-appointed apparatus, who snowed the Common­ wealth depositors, will intervene again as Franklin unfolds. The state regulators in charge of the Commonwealth receiv­ ership were John Queen and Robert Kirchner. Deputy receiver under Queen was one Kent Johnson, Commonwealth's former comptroller and the state's star witness against S.E. Copple; Johnson was to be indicted in 1990, for stealing over one million dollars of Commonwealth depositors' funds, during the receivership. Queen and Kirchner will get a federal contract to analyze the Franklin Credit Union in 1989. On this new assignment, they will hire Johnson once again.

Jerry Lowe was a Lincoln police officer, without prior training in financial investigations, assigned to go through the records of Commonwealth.

Ultimately, close to $40 million was determined to be missing from this credit union that claimed to have a scant $2.6 million in total assets. The obligations were listed on a second, secret set of books. In Nebraska's unicameral Legislature, a handful of senators moved to begin a probe into what happened to the Franklin money. The two main initiators of this legislative investigation, the one that would persist when law enforcement balked, were Senator Ernie Chambers, Democrat of north Omaha, and Sena­ tor Loran Schmit, Republican of Bellwood. Senator Chambers represented the district where the Franklin Credit Union was founded in 1968, by community activists, with the proclaimed goal of making credit available for busi­ 53"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"54 • THE FRANKLIN COVER-UP nesses and individuals in the African-American community of north Omaha. (It was by qualifying as a \"low income credit union,\" that Franklin could sell certificates of deposit to non­ members, the means by which it swindled millions.) Larry King became its manager in 1970. Chambers was in receipt of numerous complaints against King. People talked about his high spending ways, and about the teenaged boys who got in and out of limousines with King. During 1988, Chambers received some of the Foster Care Review Board reports, that abused children had named Larry King. Senator Schmit, as a Republican, knew of suspicious behav­ ior by King out of town. In early years, Larry King was a Democratic Party activist, and headed Black Democrats for McGovern in 1972, but after he shifted registration in 1981, King made his name in the GOP. As Schmit's friend and personal attorney, I shared with him my own recollections about how I had noticed the two faces of Larry King, which I later summarized in writing: \"I had personally been a delegate to the Republican National Conven­ tion in 1984 and 1988 and been a witness at the massive spending and luxury at the Larry King parties in both Dallas and New Orleans, and as chairman of the legislative Banking Committee had observed with a jaundiced eye the Franklin operation, which no information could be obtained on because it was a Federal Institution.\" At these two conventions, I attended the two biggest parties ever sponsored by Larry King. It was the first of these that brought King to my attention. The year was 1984. I was attending the Republican National Convention in Dallas, Texas, having been elected as a delegate pledged to support Ronald Reagan. Nebraska was seated in the front row in the convention hall. I had the first seat in the row. The feeling of excitement and power was awesome. The man sitting next to me, Senator Rex Haberman of Impe­ rial, Nebraska, informed me that the portly black man standing at the podium as the convention was set to begin, was from"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"THE FRANKLIN COMMITTEE • Nebraska and was the fastest rising black star in the Republi­ can Party. \"Who the blazes is he?\" 1 asked, \"And how come 1 haven't heard anything about him?\" \"Larry King,\" Senator Haberman told me, \"and you and 1 are attending his party tonight.\" \"1 had planned on going to a good movie,\" 1 told Haberman. \"Can't,\" Haberman explained. \"Not if you are going to be a good Republican. You are from Nebraska and this is a party being put on by a Nebraskan to honor another black Nebraskan, DuBois Gilliam, who is going to be getting one of the highest appointments any black person has ever gotten in government. You've got to be there.\" So, we went. I drove Rex out to the party, which was being held at Southfork Ranch, famous as the setting for the TV show \"Dallas.\" It was the most impressive party I have ever witnessed. The attendance by top politicians was remarkable; names and faces you only hear or see on television were there in number. At the center of the excitement was Larry King. Draped over him like a blanket throughout the evening was a heavyset woman, who 1 learned was Maureen Reagan, the president's daughter. From what I saw, this party had to have cost far more than the one or two hundred thousand dollars I have heard as an estimate. At a public meeting in 1990, I recalled my thinking at the time: \"I got to wondering: Here's this little credit union, and here's Larry King, obviously in the highest reaches of the Republican Party .... And I just wondered, how does he do this supposedly on a salary of $16 thousand a year?\" Such conspicuous consumption as I had witnessed, earned Larry King the tag \"flamboyant\" in just about any mention of his name. The NeVA's civil suit against King, filed November 14, 1988 in the wake of the raid, put some price tags on his lifestyIe. It itemized $4 million of King's personal expenditures, paid out of credit union funds during the previous thirteen months, including: $1 million in American Express bills, $148,000 to Old Market Limousine, $70,000 to Floral Con­ 55"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"• • • • • • • THE FRANKLIN COVER-UP cepts, $61,000 to Mastercard, $39,000 to Citibank, $37,000 to himself, $27,000 to Omaha Jewelry, and so on. As the disclosures began to flow, on how King's $2 million dollar credit union had tens of millions of dollars in deposits unaccounted for, and on the secret second set of books, I suggested to Senator Schmit that he talk to some other legisla­ tors about investigating whether some state laws were violated. Why was I concerned? Because, from my experience as chairman of the Banking, Commerce, and Insurance Committee of the Legislature, I knew that with all the regulatory controls existing for a federally insured institution, it was impossible for such a theft to occur without cooperation by higher up officials. Larry King could only have accomplished this massive theft with the help or cooperation of regulatory officials or politicians at the highest levels. That meant that institutions of government must have been compromised. Senator Schmit had his own reasons for thinking that a legislative probe of the Franklin collapse was in order. He had heard from friends of his in the black community, that Larry King spent money like a drunken sailor, but was not making any loans in the community. When I discussed a possible investigation with Schmit, I had no idea that anything other than theft, and the possible protection of illegal financial transactions, would be involved. As the investigation was launched, no one, except possibly Senator Ernie Chambers, knew where it might lead. On November 18, 1988 the Legislature passed Schmit's resolution in favor of an investigation. In front of special hear­ ings of the Legislature's Executive Board, the strands of evi­ dence against Larry King were finally pulled together, for the first time, before officials who would pay attention. After the first session, on December 12, 1988, Senator S6"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"THE FRANKLIN COMMITTEE • Chambers made a dramatic announcement about the probe. The investigation would go into not only financial wrongdoing, he said, but also the physical and sexual abuse of children by persons connected with Franklin. People holding official jobs might be affected, added Senator Schmit. At the three and a half hour Executive Board hearing on December 19, 1988, Carol Stitt, Dennis Carlson, and Burrell Williams of the Foster Care Review Board summarized the abuse complaints centered around Franklin's top officer. They presented their files on the Webb foster home and on Loretta Smith. CARLSON: The nature of these allegations are something that is going to shock the Committee. They deal with cult activities, they deal with sacrifices of small children, they deal with sexual abuse, and there's a correlation between these two different reports. We have, the Boys' Town report ... prepared by a worker from Boys' Town named Julie Walters, ... (which) contains the allegations of the children that were in the Webb foster home, Nelly primarily. Years later, well, two years later, we have Loretta Smith in.Richard Young Hospital who's making allegations against Larry King and as far as we know there is no relationship between Nelly and Loretta Smith. . .. Both reports talk about the Omaha Girls Club, both reports mention a specific individual who is the superintendent of schools .... SENATOR REMMERS: [T[he question that came into mind, it's been in my mind since you've been testifying and I think you've answered part of it just now, is you're talking about about these abuses from children from Boys' Town and Girls' Club and so forth, now is there a common thread that goes over here to the Credit Union deal that we are investigating? In other words to the Franklin Credit Union? Is there a common thread there that kind of leads to that? CAROL STITT: Well, the common thread is Larry King. SENATOR REMMERS: Yes, that's what I mean. It all goes back to him? OK. CAROL STITT: Yes, he seems to be more the organizer, or the high-class pimp, I mean if that helps fit this together. ... 57"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"• THE FRANKLIN COVER·UP Stitt also clarified what she had written in her June 1988 letter to Attorney General Spire, about a Kansas City connection of Larry King. She testified that she had cross-checked with the Kansas City detective, who reportedly inquired of Kirstin Hallberg about when Nebraska was going to crack down on King. The officer, said Stitt, \"confirmed that Larry King had been there, had contributed money to a group home and when he left, three boys came forward and said that they had been abused by him while he was there.\" The Executive Board also received from the FCRB the hand­ written report by Julie Walters, on her interview with the teen­ aged victims during 1986. In the December 21, 1988 Omaha World-Herald, reporter James Allen Flanery recounted a tele­ phone interview with Walters at her home in another state, in which she told him how their testimony had seemed at first \"too bizarre to be true.\" But the more experience she gained with troubled children, Walters added, \"working in probation, I'm more sure than ever that there is more truth than not in their accounts. The conclusion I reached was the kids I spoke with were not lying.\" What the senators heard at the closed December 19, 1988 meeting shook them to the bone. \"The information brought tears to my eyes,\" Schmit said, according to the Lincoln Journal. \"I do not cry easily and I was not the only person that was moved.\" Chambers echoed the witnesses' outrage about delays: \"With this type of information it is inexcusable that action had not been taken of an investigative nature. People were not contacted that should have been. Leads were not followed up that should have been followed up. My feeling is that the whole thing is being sat upon and nothing was done.\" The question of a cover-up of Franklin-linked crimes came up at the outset, in this way. Omaha Police Chief Wadman and state Attorney General Spire offered a lame protest. \"Every step that should have been taken was taken,\" Wadman told the Journal. Spire said, \"We did receive some sensitive information in July. My office acted promptly and professionally and noth­ ing was sat on.

Attorney Kirk Naylor came on as Special Counsel. On February 15, Lowe sent a memo to the committee on the results of his first comprehensive evaluation of the case, including its handling by law enforcement. Lowe wrote: This matter is indeed a complex and complicated one, com­ mencing with the closing of the Franklin Credit Union ... and mushrooming into a situation where additional allega­ tions (other than the financial improprieties) have arisen, including influence peddling, child abuse and neglect, child sexual abuse, pornography, substance abuse, homicide, and inaction and possibly malfeasance on the part of law enforce­ ment agencies, public agencies, and public officials for events dating several years back.

The task which the Committee has undertaken will not be an easy one .... The allegations regarding the exploitation of children are indeed disturbing. What appears to be documented cases of child abuse and sexual abuse dating back several years with no enforcement action being taken by the appropriate agen­ cies is on its face, mind boggling. In this and other early reports, Lowe made clear that every aspect of the Franklin case was politically hot. Larry King had become wealthy and influential thanks to quite a number of \"big people,\" he commented. Moreover, Lowe reported, there were indications that King was involved in guns and money transfers into Nicaragua, of involvement by the CIA, and possi­ bly \"a White House connection.\" There appeared to be \"some type of connection between the money missing [from Franklin], the crisis in the Savings and Loans, and the funneling of money to Haiti and Nicaragua.\" Lowe wrote that there was evidence Omaha Police Chief 59"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"• • • 60 • THE FRANKLIN COVER-UP Robert Wadman had stayed at Larry King's residence in Wash­ ington, D.C. Lowe retraced the leads contained in the documents assem­ bled by the FCRB. In March, he interviewed Loretta Smith three times. In April, he talked with Cornelia (Nelly) Patterson, who had taken back her original name after she escaped from custody of the Webbs. With Lowe's investigative reports in hand, the Franklin com­ mittee convened hearings. When some state officials were called before them, the senators met with a stone wall. Testifying on June 22, 1989, Attorney General Spire ap­ peared still unchastened. Just as his office had dallied in the face of Carol Stitt's plea for action on complaints against Larry King the year before, Spire now said about Franklin-linked child abuse, that \"based on conclusions and reports of the FBI, the Omaha Police, and the Nebraska State Patrol, all three of those have concluded that the reports do not have substance. Someone was working at cross-purposes outside the hearing room, as well. While the Legislature's Franklin committee was getting started at the end of 1988, the NCVA selected a firm called Financial Advisory Group, of Council Bluffs, Iowa, to make its own determination about what had happened to Franklin's missing millions. FAG was a partnership formed by John Queen and Robert Kirchner, whose earlier appointments included the one they got from Governor Kerrey-state regulators to oversee the liquidation of the Commonwealth Savings and Loan. In their 1989-1990 audit of Franklin Credit Union, Queen and Kirchner would conclude that Larry King spent nearly all of it on flowers, limousines, gold watches, and his generally ex­ travagant lifestyle. Even as he proceeded with the audit of Franklin, Queen was serving during 1990 as deputy receiver for Commonwealth, overseeing the liquidation of the bank's remaining assets and"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"• • • THE FRANKLIN COMMITTEE • the disbursement of the proceeds. On August 14, his chief assistant in the receivership, Kent Johnson, was arrested by the FBI for stealing over a million dollars in Commonwealth funds. Although Queen's co-signature was on every check Johnson wrote to steal the money, Queen claimed that his name had been forged. His career, in any case, was tightly intertwined with Johnson's. Johnson worked for him in the Commonwealth receivership, on the Franklin audit, and at an Omaha corporation he owned, Phoenix Sign Corp. This was a venture Queen launched by buying up the assets of Globe Neon, a bankrupt firm. One of Queen's fellow holders of a $50,000 share of Globe Neon before it folded, was none other than Larry King! Queen and Kirchner enjoyed the sympathy of investigator Jerry Lowe, who wrote in his February 15, 1989 case summary for the Franklin committee: A private consulting firm headed by Omaha residents John Queen and Bob Kirchner, both formerly associated with the receiver for Commonwealth Savings in Lincoln, Nebraska, was retained by the National Credit Union Association (NCUA), in early 1989 and given the responsibility to trace all the funds flowing into and out of the Franklin Credit Union. . .. I am familiar with both Mr. Queen and Mr. Kirchner due to my involvement as a Lincoln Police Depart­ ment investigator in the Commonwealth matter. ... I can personally attest to the thoroughness and capabilities of Mr. Queen and Mr. Kirchner and the people assisting them and believe an association with them would save us an enormous amount of time in following the money. I have been Senator Loran Schmit's personal attorney for a number of years. When we were both senators, we frequently worked together on major issues. At other times, such as when we disagreed on the issue of telephone deregulation, we led opposite sides, and fought each other tooth and nail. During the early months of the legislative investigation of Franklin, I personally had serious doubts as to the validity of 61"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"62 • THE FRANKLIN COVER-UP what was being alleged. I provided a minimum of legal advice to Senator Schmit during this period, but he did insist that I be available to provide him such advice. Schmit had the experience of a previous investigation, in­ volving drug-related matters and the State Patrol, which ended up with him and other senators, including myself, being sued by some of the individuals investigated. He wanted to make sure that he made no error that would cause any legal liability for him. Even though we had won that earlier suit against us, Senator Schmit wanted to exercise all caution, to protect himself from lawsuits. Therefore, like many other state and national politicians, he quite properly had private legal counsel-me. In the spring of 1989, after the Franklin committee had been conducting investigations for some time, Senator Schmit sought my legal advice. He wanted to know the legal liability involved, if he supported a planned report of the committee, which was to suggest that there was child abuse committed by prominent individuals-not to be named-which had not been properly investigated by agencies of government. I asked for no names and he provided no names of the individuals he was talking about. In point of fact, there were enough rumors floating in the legislative corridors and on the streets of Omaha, that at least a dozen prominent persons could have been the subject of these accusations. I gave him the same advice then, that I would give now: \"Accusations of child abuse are the worst accusations you can make against an individual. That is because, no matter what the truth of the matter, once the accusation is made, it will never be able to be rubbed completely off, even if the individual accused is as innocent and pure as can be. Therefore, before you sign your name to anything that suggests that there is serious child abuse or before you suggest that an agency of government has failed in its duty to find or investigate child abuse, make sure you have the smoking gun that establishes that is what actually occurred. Not just for your legal protection, but because that is the right thing to do. To falsely accuse of child abuse is a terrible thing. To cover up child abuse, is worse than falsely accusing.\""},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"THE FRANKLIN COMMITTEE • I had my own personal experience of a false accusation of child abuse, which still bums in my soul. It was also a hideous example of the use of political office to intimidate, silence or destroy political enemies. The year was 1984, early January. I had announced my intention to run for the United States Senate. As chairman of the Legislature's Banking Committee, I was actively seeking to investigate the collapse of Commonwealth Savings, which had just occurred. In an Associated Press listing of the ten most powerful people in Nebraska, as ranked by media editors and publishers, I was number 5, behind the governor, U.S. Senator J.J. Exon, Omaha World-Herald publisher Harold An­ dersen, and University of Nebraska President Ronald Roskens. Polls showed me as the leading candidate for the Republican senatorial nomination. Then, I received a message from Republican Party leaders. It was simple: \"GOP strategists at the highest levels believe this is the year the Republicans can beat J.J. Exon. Opinion poll analysis shows that such a victory can only come, if the candidate is a woman and has no political 'baggage.' (Remem­ ber, 1984 was the year of Democrat Geraldine Ferraro's candi­ dacy for U.S. Vice President, the 'Year of the Woman' in politics.) Republican leaders are fearful that you, John DeCamp, will be able to win the primary, but because of 'baggage' and controversiality, you will not beat Exon in November. Therefore, Republican leaders ask you to withdraw from the primary. If you do not drop out voluntarily, you will have to be stopped some other way. And stopped you will be, because this race means so much to Republican leadership, at the highest levels in Washington.\" I did not listen. I continued to campaign for the Senate seat. Shortly thereafter, a tenant in one of my apartments, who was delinquent on her rent, lodged an anonymous complaint to the Nebraska Department of Social Services. She charged that I and my wife had \"abused\" my young daughter when she was five years old. A picture in a family photo album, showing my daughter in a pose like the Coppertone baby ads, was the basis for the complaint. 63"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"64 • THE FRANKLIN COVER-UP Two investigations conducted immediately, one by the DSS and one by the Lincoln Police, found there was no child abuse and so reported. But a County Attorney, Mike Heavican, took matters into his own hands. Heavican was on the Republican search commit­ tee for a senatorial candidate, which ultimately picked a woman with no \"baggage,\" and she lost to Exon. He also was someone whose name had come up as my Senate Banking Committee attempted to start probing the Commonwealth and State Secu­ rity matters, as someone who may have granted illegal tax favors to involved parties. Heavican filed a petition, alleging that I and my wife had abused our daughter in the way we were educating and raising her. It was a civil, not a criminal, filing, but I am sure it was designed to gain statewide publicity. Heavican's action also exemplified how a public position can be abused. It comes as a shock to most Americans, that the lowliest county attorney has absolute immunity when he files complaints or charges against somebody, even if he does so knowing them to be false. His automatic immunity is sup­ posed to protect the prosecutor, as an institution of government, from being deterred from effective action by the specter of future lawsuits. The abuse of this institutional privilege can be terribly destructive. Months of investigation resulted in a legal opinion from Judge W.W. Nuernberger, that there was no child abuse. Nuern­ berger concluded that if Mr. and Mrs. John DeCamp were guilty of child abuse, then so were a lot of families and so was the late President Kennedy, and perhaps every family in Nebraska would have to destroy its photo albums, if I were considered guilty of anything. While the investigation was under way, media coverage continued to smear my name with the charges. I maintained that the phantom child abuse was concocted by Heavican, using the County Attorney's office, for the political purposes of knocking me out of the Senate race and stopping my Com­ monwealth/State Security investigation. Six years after these horrible events, my suspicions were confirmed."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"• • • THE FRANKLIN COMMITTEE • On March 17, 1990, the Kansas City Star reported on the DeCamp child abuse allegation: ... Roland Luedtke, a former lieutenant governor and the mayor of Lincoln from 1983 to 1987, launched his own review of the charges. \"The report that came back to me was that [DeCamp] was pure as the driven snow,\" Luedtke said, but, he added, whoever may have had it in their mind to get rid of DeCamp \"accomplished their purpose.\" My 1984 ordeal came to mind in the spring of 1989, as I insisted to Senator Schmit that he exercise caution in the Franklin case. Senator Schmit offered an amendment to the committee report, written by himself, which stated, in essence, that at this point in the investigation, the legislative committee did not have the smoking gun that would establish the truth of any of the child abuse allegations or the failure of institutions of government. In July 1989, a controversy broke out on the Franklin com­ mittee, over Schmit's amendment and the course of the investi­ gation. Some members maintained that Senator Schmit was not doing enough to follow up the child abuse. Schmit rejoined that the information gathered thus far by Lowe, while useful, was mostly second-hand, and that the committee should follow the advice he had been given by a friend in law enforcement: \"Follow the money trail.\" There is almost no important crime that can be committed, said Schmit, echoing his friend's advice, without spending money, and spending money leaves a paper trail. It should be possible to move from hearsay to court­ admissable evidence such as checks, credit card receipts, and flight manifests.

In a review of his work for the committee, Caradori recalled his first impressions: From the onset it was apparent that I was up against a barrier regarding mistrust of the Franklin Legislative Committee. I was told repeatedly that people were afraid to divulge any information, not only because of retribution of the alleged perpetrators, but also because they feared they would be publicly discredited by the Omaha World-Herald. People were also becoming discouraged by the lack of progress made thus far on the investigation and they translated this to mean \"cover up.\" Initially, the reports which Mr. Lowe had generated were reviewed in detail. It was evident that while there were a large amount of reports generated, that very little of sub­ stance had been gained by him regarding firsthand informa­ tion. It was then decided that, while secondhand information had been valuable in that it presented an idea of the possible scope of abuse going on, that it was more important to locate individuals who had actually been abused and participated in the various activities that comprise this case."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"• • • CHAPTER 8 \"SOMEBODY HAS TO TELL THE STORY\" Caradori did find victims who would talk. Four of them allowed him to videotape their stories, in nearly 30 hours of sessions during late 1989 and early 1990. These interviews contained detailed allegations of sexual abuse, drug usage, pornography and other crimes by prominent Omaha citizens. Implicated, among others, were individuals already named by Nelly and Kimberly Webb, Brenda Parker, and Loretta Smith, as abusers or pornographers: Rusty Nelson, Deward Finch, Larry King. What these victim-witnesses related became the central mat­ ter of the Franklin case, but nobody except for a few law enforcement personnel, state senators, and grand jury members has viewed the Caradori tapes. Snippets were aired on television in Omaha. With their contents largely unpublicized, the tapes became a target of speculation and denunciation, rumor and doubt.

She indi­ cated that she was also involved with other minors involved in pornography and homosexual acts involving various peo­ ple in Omaha. Several of the individuals she mentioned were Alan Baer, Harold Andersen, and also former Police Chief Robert Wadman, who had participated in many parties. It should be noted that Alisha also indicated that Mr. Wadman is a pedophile. Contrary to impressions that the Omaha World-Herald tried to convey, Alisha Owen not only did not seek out Caradori, but she told him only a fraction of the story at that first meeting. As she later described to the legislative Franklin committee, she was extremely reluctant to get involved at all. After Cara­ dori left, she contacted the prison psychiatrist, who directed her to Superintendent Lawrence Wayne. He advised her to tell the truth and to cooperate with the Franklin committee.

She observed later when the black youth emerged from the bedroom that he was tucking in his shirt and fastening his pants. Alisha also observed Alfie Allen going in and out of the bedroom numerous times. She observed a young boy approximately 14 years old sitting on Harold Anderson's lap.

He also fits the description as related by Alisha. Other information from Alisha was that Troy Boner and Danny King were taken to Council Bluffs by adult males for sexual purposes. Corroboration: Troy Boner and Danny King related these events in detail in their respective videotaped statements. Alisha also describes a forced sexual encounter which occurred at the French Cafe in August of 1985. Present were five boys from Boys Town, Tom McKinney [sic], and Judge Theodore Carlson, among others.

Information regarding these flights is as fol­ lows: ... Private Flights: The first private flight that Alisha was on occurred in March of 1984 .... The plane landed at a small airport in California .... Upon their arrival, Danny and Alisha were taken to an Embassy Suites type motel, and two businessmen came into their room. One man had sex with Danny, and one man had sex with Alisha. They received no money. Please note that she said that Larry King had ordered her to take this trip. The man that Alisha had sex with she describes as \"ex­ tremely weird.\" He hurt her, forced her to have anal sex, slapped her and threw her around. He took out a knife and threatened her if she didn't perform oral sex on him, and threatened to cut off her nipples. She was afraid and crying.

Corroboration: Troy indicates in his video statement that Alisha, after this ordeal, was extremely upset and \"smelled\" and was a \"mess.\" ... When Alisha was asked who participated and who was aware of the transportation of kids across state lines for sexual purposes, she said that Larry King and Alan Baer were aware of this. It is probable that other adults were also aware of this. She stated that Bob Kerry [sic] knew about these activities and that Larry (Lnuk) had told her this. Larry (Lnuk) also indicated that Bob Kerry knew about the closing of the Franklin Credit Union before it fell. Other issues discussed regarding Bob Kerry consisted of Alisha's statements that she had a friend who works for Dixon and Dixon law firm who is responsible for maintaining the keys to the file room.

It is also possible that Florence Davis may be involved in \"funneling kids\" into certain foster homes. See a transcribed interview with Millie Boggs* the Director for the Omaha Children's Home for further infor­ mation regarding Florence Davis .... Caradori filed a back-up report for this part of the precis, entitled \"Taped conversation with Gary A.

Let me tell you a little bit about what I know about Florence. I mean, Florence just used to be a line worker. I mean she was a worker like I am. GC: I want you to talk about that because her name has come up. Just because a person's name has come up doesn't make you guilty either. MB: No. GC: And maybe it came up because she had the position at the time. And doggone it, I'm going to get her pulled on the carpet and have her explain herself from back then.

In late June of 1983 I attended a meeting at the state with Florence Davis, the McArthur children's worker, and Lloyd Linquist, the permanency planner.

Quite to the contrary, after meeting with Mr. and Mrs. Webb, I was more concerned than ever as I did not feel that this was a proper home for these three children .... Something that I think is extremely suspicious is that about the time that the King mess was surfacing, Florence Davis suddenly left the state, almost overnight, and suppos­ edly is living in California. A short time later, Lloyd Linquist went on sick leave and was gone for many months. And then about the time he was to return, he also resigned. While he was on leave I understand that he took a trip to Tahiti. I think personally that Lloyd Linquist and Florence Davis know a lot about the situation regarding the abuse of these children and they should be found and questioned .... One time when Florence was working for the state, I be­ lieve before she became a supervisor, I noticed that she de­ clared bankruptcy while she was living in her new condo and had her new car. However, after that whenever I would see Florence it seemed like she was dressed extremely well and did not appear to have any monetary worries, although I am not a friend of Florence's and I did nothing with her socially. Lloyd Linquist also was impeccably dressed, although someone told me that he had only rented a room at the Grace Bible Institute and actually didn't even have an apartment. ... I thought it was interesting that Lloyd could take trips to Europe which I know that he did in the years that he was a permanency planner, and other exotic vacations on the salary that he was paid by NDSS. Caradori's summary of the testimony from Alisha resumed: During the second video taped statement, [Alisha] again discussed the pornography aspect of this case. She said that Rusty Nelson develops his own photographs and that he would more than likely have the negatives of the group and individual pornographic photos, possibly to blackmail Larry King at a later date.

She again discussed the parentage of her child. She said that she is 99.9 percent sure that her child is Bob Wadman's, and that conception occurred in August of 1984. She had sex­ ual intercourse with him on August 8th, August 10th, August 17th, and August 22nd.

Tim took Troy to Alan Baer's residence in the Twin Towers which Troy stated was apartment #201 .... He said that he knew he was there so Alan Baer could get acquainted with him, and so he could make some money.

He said that he walked back to Alan Baer's apartment later that afternoon at Alan Baer's request. Alan met him at the door in a yellow Ralph Lauren bathrobe. Alan Baer asked him to get undressed. (Troy stated that he thought he was going to get $50.00.) He started undressing in the hall­ way and Alan Baer asked him to go into the bedroom. Alan Baer then got undressed and a sexual encounter ensued, including mutual masturbation and oral sex. After this sexual encounter, they took a shower together and he received $400.00 in fifty-dollar bills. Alan Baer told him to call him that next Tuesday.

The other boy's name was Shawn (Lnuk) and he was approximately 12 to 13 years old. They drove to Des Moines in a tan Mercedes, which Troy thought might possibly be rented. They stayed at the Savoy Hotel in downtown Des Moines. Troy and Shawn stayed in the room at the hotel while Alan Baer attended some business meetings.

During this three weeks, Larry would stop by at various times, usually in the afternoon, for sex with him. They would perform oral sex on each other, and Larry King performed anal sex on Troy.

It had been viewed by himself and the other members of the Franklin committee, Senators Bernice Labedz, Dan Lynch, Jerome Warner and Den­ nis Baack. \"Members of our committee are dismayed,\" Schmit wrote in a letter to Attorney General Spire, released at the press conference, \"by the fact that no state or federal investiga­ tive bodies interviewed any of these new witnesses we have, even though they were discovered by our investigative efforts 83"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"84 • THE FRANKLIN COVER-UP after a fairly short time and with a very small budget. ...

He abided by the committee consensus, however, to hold them back. By December 1989, local, state and federal law enforcement had received copies of the videotapes of Alisha Owen, Troy Boner, and Danny King. Some officials, notably Douglas County Sheriff Dick Roth, said they believed the victim-wit­ nesses. After watching five hours of the tapes, the Associated Press reported in February 1990, Roth \"said he found the wit­ nesses' statements to be credible.\" But there was no apparent move toward prosecutions."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 9 THE DECAMP MEMO On January 18, 1990, I released a document that soon became infamous as \"the DeCamp memo.\" For the first time, the names of prominent alleged perpetrators were public. A lot has been written about that memo, much of it full of untruths and distortions. What follows is the true story of the DeCamp memo and the events leading up to it. In the spring of 1989, after the first child abuse stories surfaced, I recommended to Senator Loran Schmit that he go directly to the FBI in Omaha to discuss the very serious allegations being made against Police Chief Robert Wadman by various individuals. This was before anybody even knew that Alisha Owen or other victim-witnesses existed and, of course, before Alisha Owen's allegations against Robert Wad­ man were made. This legal advice of mine to Senator Schmit was in response to his question as to how to handle things, when law enforce­ ment officials themselves were being accused of impropriety. \"Go to the highest authority you can, above the authority who is being accused,\" I told him. Senator Schmit insisted I go with him to this meeting, as his personal attorney. I agreed to go, but on condition that he first meet one-on-one with the regional head of the FBI, Nick O'Hara, without me present. He did meet with O'Hara for about one hour. Then I was called into the room. It was only at that urne, through discussion, that I learned that the individual in question was former Omaha Police Chief Robert Wadman. In brutal language and with the most somber demeanor possible, Mr. O'Hara made it clear that probably his closest 85"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"• • • 86 • THE FRANKLIN COVER-UP friend in the world was Police Chief Robert Wadman, and that anyone who would dare to accuse Robert Wadman of impropriety had better realize that in accusing Wadman, they were effectively taking on Nick O'Hara and the FBI. I realized instantly, that my advice to Senator Schmit may have been faulty. How could I have known in advance, that the head of the FBI and the former chief were so intimate in their business and personal relationships? There was tension in the air. I made a point of saying that I also was sure that all these accusations-whatever they were-had to be nonsense. I pointed out that my experience as a public official, a senator for sixteen years, made me appreci­ ate the fact that it is easy to accuse a public official and darned difficult for one to defend himself, since the accusations are immediately put on the front page of the paper and broadcast as the lead story on the evening TV news. But, as if to make a point that both I and Senator Schmit had better understand how serious it was for anyone to come to the FBI and raise questions about Robert Wadman, O'Hara had us sit down and provide him information about ourselves, as ifwe were the ones being accused and investigated, proceeding exactly as one might expect the FBI to do with someone the FBI was investigating. \"What's your date of birth? Where were you born? What is your exact name? Do you have any aliases?\" O'Hara quizzed us. When we left the FBI offices, I said to Senator Schmit, \"Wow, did J make a mistake. Anybody who dares to investigate this is going to get themselves buried by the FBI, if they start making any accusations against Wadman or anybody associated with him.\" I had no idea how prophetic those words were.

Articles began to appear in the Omaha World­ Herald. aimed to discredit the witnesses and intimidate any other potential child victim-witnesses from testifying or coming forward with information. As the stories proliferated, Gary Caradori expressed to Sena­ tor Schmit his concern for the safety of the victim-witnesses who had allowed themselves to be taped. Schmit sought my legal advice again. \"These kids need protection or they are going to end up dead, or become afraid to continue to tell the truth,\" the senator said. \"The committee has to do something to guarantee their protection. \" Gary Caradori was even more vehement on the need for protection. \"Unless they get into a protected environment, where Alan Baer and Larry King and Robert Wadman are not able to get to them and scare them, I can tell you the kids will fold. They will do whatever those guys order them to do. They will fold, or they will end up dead,\" Caradori hammered at Senator Schmit. \"You have to do something to protect them.\" My legal advice to Senator Schmit and my direct warning to Gary Caradori at that time, in December 1989 and January 1990, was the most painful information I have ever had to provide someone. \"You cannot and should not do anything to use committee funds or committee personnel to provide protection for these kids,\" I told Schmit. \"Otherwise, you and the committee may be accused of impropriety and tampering with witnesses, and who knows what else. Painful as it is for me to tell you this, you have to find some other legal channel to provide protection for the kids. Whether that channel is the courts or a judge or whoever, it is something that either the lawyer for the kids should be doing, or some institution of government vested with the power and responsibility to do those things should be doing. But you, Senator Schmit, should not personally get involved in any way, shape or form in providing money or assistance or protection for these kids, nor should the committee, in my opinion.\" Senator Schmit shared his concerns with other members of 87"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"88 • THE FRANKLIN COVER·UP the legislature, who were hearing the rumors and who had their own resources for finding out information. Key among them was Senator Jerry Chizek of Omaha, chairman of the Legisla­ ture's Judiciary Committee. He was very tight with Douglas County Sheriff Dick Roth. In early January 1990, as stories of what was involved in the Franklin case spread through the streets of Omaha, Senator Chizek took it upon himself to set up a very secret, private meeting among Senator Schmit, Sheriff Roth, a representative of the Douglas County District Court, Judge Corrigan, and himself. I was asked by Senator Chizek and Senator Schmit to attend the meeting. I was glad to come, for the purpose of providing legal guidance to Senator Schmit, so that he did not engage in trying to solve the problem of protection for the witnesses in an illegal, if well-intentioned, manner. The meeting took place in an auto body repair shop some­ where in west Omaha, on what I am sure was the coldest day of the year. For most of the afternoon, discussion centered around the essence of the rumors that were circulating about the contents of the Caradori tapes. Attention was focused on the necessity of protecting the victim-witnesses who had provided testimony. Sheriff Roth had viewed the tapes. I presume others in the room also had, including Senator Schmit. I personally had not viewed the tapes and, believe it or not, have not viewed them to this day. From the conversation on that cold January day, there was no doubt at all, that Sheriff Roth and others in the room believed in the validity and accuracy of the allegations made on the tapes. As the talks progessed, Sheriff Roth used a phrase that had special meaning to me. \"I will tell you one thing,\" he said, \"Nick O'Hara of the FBI and Robert Wadman are closer than nineteen is to twenty.

They carry enough weight in this community to do what they want and get away with it.\" Sheriff Roth did stand up for the victims of Franklin-related child abuse, on several occasions. 1 know that he subsequently came under intense pressure, including from the World-Herald, to repudiate his belief that the allegations of the child victim­ witnesses were true. The net result of the secret meeting with Sheriff Roth and Judge Corrigan of the Douglas County District Court was noth­ ing. The plan was for Judge Corrigan to explain the situation, including the fact that fellow district court judges were the subject of some of the accusations, to the other dozen district court judges. Then a plan might be worked out, for witness protection under the auspices of the court. Unfortunately, that did not transpire. What Judge Corrigan did or did not do, only he knows. About the time of the secret meeting with Judge Corrigan and Sheriff Roth, my office received a long-distance phone call from a girl who identified herself as Loretta Smith. 1 returned her call. \"I'm one of the Franklin victim-witnesses,\" she explained. \"I'm the one they wrote a lot about in the Omaha World­ Herald. A friend of mine told me that maybe you would help me.\" Having read the stories about Loretta, who was not identified by name in the World-Herald, 1knew basically the story she was telling, as to her abuse and the individuals who had supposedly abused her. \"I know who you are, Loretta, and if 1 can help you, 1 will,\" 1 said. \"And yes, 1 have read about you and your story and, surprising as it might sound to you, 1 do believe you.\" We discussed ways 1 might help her. A couple of weeks after that phone call, reporter Kathy Rutledge of the Lincoln Journal telephoned me at night at 89"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"90 • THE FRANKLIN COVER-UP home. She said she understood I had been in touch with Loretta Smith, and she wanted to know all about the matter. It was clear from the beginning of the conversation, by the tone of her voice and her accusatory questions, that Kathy was intent on doing a hatchet job on me. I begged Kathy Rutledge not to distort facts. She repeatedly tried to suggest that I had improperly contacted Loretta Smith. Furthermore, she kept implying that I had told Loretta that I had secret information on Franklin, which I would be trying to use improperly. I corrected Rutledge again and again. I pointed out to her that if I had done the things she was saying or implying that I did, such conduct would be a violation of legal codes of ethics and would subject me to penalties, including even revocation of my license to practice law. I urged that she not even write a story about this, for the protection of the young lady involved. If she insisted on writing a story, I said, she should at least tell the truth and not distort facts. A few days later, a lawyer working in my office, John Goc, walked into the office carrying the Lincoln Journal and talking loudly: \"What are you trying to do, DeCamp, get yourself disbar­ red? What are you going around talking to this reporter for? When the Bar Association sees this, you can bet you'll be in trouble. I hope you have a good explanation. You're going to kill your lobbying business with this kind of story.\" That is ap­ proximately what John Goc said to me on January 18, 1990. I ran down to get a copy of the newspaper, knowing already what Kathy Rutledge must have done. Determined to get herself a headline story and lots of attention, she had to distort the truth. Just as I feared, every negative and distorted impression was conveyed by her story. Six days later, I would be notified by the Bar Association that I was under investigation, as a result of the Rutledge story. Even before that happened, I was confronted by Omaha World-Herald reporter Bob Dorr on the telephone, demanding that I answer questions about Franklin, such as what I knew, where I got my information, how I got the name of this Franklin witness, what secret information I had, and why I was conceal­"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"THE DECAMP MEMO • ing things. His drift was the same as Kathy Rutledge's ques­ tions. I determined that I could no longer keep silent. I would answer the questions of Dorr in detail in writing, so that there would be no misunderstanding or distortion possible. Or, if there was distortion nonetheless, I would have a record of what I had actually told him. My answer to Bob Dorr' s questions was the DeCamp memo. I also prepared a documented reply to the Nebraska Bar Association inquiry, to prove that the conduct related by Kathy Rutledge in her article had not occurred. I was able to submit affidavits from two employees in my office, who swore that it was Loretta Smith who contacted me, and not vice versa. I also obtained an affidavit from a friend of Loretta, who knew me and my wife from when we had helped her, on request from her minister, several years earlier, and who was the person who advised Loretta to call me. Within hours after presentation to the Bar Association of this documentation, the bar investiga­ tion was terminated. I was cleared of any impropriety or wrong­ doing. The Lincoln Journal ran a second story on the matter, after the DeCamp memo was issued, in which Rutledge attempted to correct the falsehoods and deceptions in the first story. In any case, I filed a slander and defamation lawsuit against the Journal for that first story, which lawsuit is still in the courts. . . . I charged in the memo, that in the Franklin case, \"institutions of government have failed and thus credibility of government itself is at stake in this matter and in a very real sense, first the [legislative J committee and then the Legislature, are the court of last resort.\" (Emphasis in original.)

The Press quietly and carefully covers up, either thru ignorance or artifice, while the various institutions of Government repeat the old Com­ monwealth/State Security game of \"let the statute of limita­ tions run\" on those that should and could be immediately prosecuted and investigate and study and \"ask for more information.\" Why? Because of the personalities involved. The World Herald and Lincoln Journal want to know where I get information on Franklin. Get serious. A reporter has to be deaf, dumb, blind and corrupt not to know the names of the personalities involved and the scope of the allegations. Stop on any street corner in Omaha; go into any coffee shop; have a drink in any bar in Omaha, or if you are lazy, walk around the Capitol Rotunda in Lincoln and simply listen to the discussions. Here is what you will learn: 1. The allegations are that the most powerful and rich public personalities of the state are central figures in the in­ vestigation. 2. That these include former Omaha World Herald Editor Harold Andersen; Larry King of the dead Franklin Credit Union; Former Omaha Police Chief Robert Wadman; Media Personality Peter Citron; Ak-Sar-Ben Financier and bluest of the bluebloods, Alan Baer, for starters. 3. That the allegations are that these individuals were some of the centerpieces in a co-ordinated program of Child Abuse, Drug Abuse, and abuse of their various public posi­ tions of trust and honor. 4. That prosecutors who should be prosecuting are afraid to prosecute for one reason or another and that the public itself is rapidly losing faith in its fundamental institutions of government as a result of this perceived coverup, whether real or imagined. . ..

I fear, just like any alleged child victims in this bizarre tragedy, that the rich and the powerful will use their positions of power and control of institutions of government to shut up those who would speak out and bring things to a head. The DeCamp memo lit a firestorm of controversy in Omaha and statewide. On radio, TV, and in the press, it was dealt with daily for several weeks. The furor touched off by the circulation of the memo is conveyed in a March 17, 1990 Kansas City Star article, head­ lined \"Former legislator's angry memo turns sober Nebraska on its ear\": Two months ago, DeCamp sat behind his [word processing] machine and pounded out the infamous \"DeCamp Memo.\" The piece of invective became the subject of discussion from Omaha's silk-stocking salons to the cowboy bars in the Sand Hills. He named five prominent Omaha men as \"central figures\" in a legislative committee's yearlong review of allegations of sexual abuse linked to the 1988 collapse of the Franklin Community Federal Credit Union .... DeCamp's memo found its way to dozens of copy ma­ chines and quickly littered the state, spawning a swirl of gossip. In an attempt to put the rumors to rest and find the truth, the U.S. attorney called a federal grand jury last month. And next week a Douglas County grand jury in Omaha will begin hearing the allegations, including one that King flew teenagers to Kansas City in 1985 to perform sex with men in a rented room at the Westin Crown Center Hotel. Hardly modest, DeCamp takes credit for the convening of the grand juries. \"If it had not been for that memo, 93"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"• • • 94 • THE FRANKLIN COYER-UP there would not even be a grand jury investigation today,\" DeCamp contends .... DeCamp had the audacity to name, among others, Harold Andersen, former publisher of the Omaha World-Herald. DeCamp left the implication that Andersen, an icon of jour­ nalism who lunches with President Bush, had a fetish for children. Said one politician, \"It was like insulting God.\" Rumors started reaching me, that I was going to be sued by various people. Finally, a close friend of mine, who is a prominent reporter in Nebraska and whom I agreed not to name in this book, came to me privately to say that an agreement had been reached among the various individuals I had named in the memo, and others, for Peter Citron to be the one to sue me. The purpose would be to destroy me in full view of the public, and to repudiate the DeCamp memo. Truth put a crimp in that plan. Not long after the message was delivered to me, Peter Citron was charged with sex crimes involving male minors in the Omaha area. It seems that some parents, who knew their children were hanging around Peter Citron, were shocked to see him named in the DeCamp memo. They responded by asking their children, whether or not there was any truth to the allegations, with respect to Citron. One after another, the boys began to pour out the truth to their parents. The demands by parents for immediate action left the police and prosecutors no choice. They had to file charges against Peter Citron, although I rather suspect they did not want to. Citron ultimately pleaded guilty. Today he is in prison, sentenced as a mentally disordered sex offender. Needless to say, the World-Herald devoted many column­ inches to condemning the DeCamp memo as irresponsible. I cannot neglect to comment on the World-Herald's overall role in the Franklin scandal. Nebraska has only one state-wide news source. It is the"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"THE DECAMP MEMO • Omaha World-Herald. Our small population, vast expanses, and the cost of maintaining a daily newspaper in this day and age, all guarantee that the World-Herald is the news source for this state. With that awesome power, one would think would come a corresponding measure of responsibility, to make sure Nebraskans get all sides of an issue. That they really get the news. But the World-Herald's long-standing pattern of behavior is just the opposite. If it has an editorial attitude on a story, its news coverage and every other aspect of the newspaper are mustered to accentuate the preferred side of the issue and suppress opposing views. In the case of Franklin, the paper went to new lengths. The integrity and credibility of the newspaper went on the chopping block, for the sake of suppressing the truth about Franklin and, to a high degree, the Commonwealth and State Security banking stories-Nebraska's three biggest scandals of the last fifty years. Why all this effort? Because, tragically, the people who control the World-Herald appear to have a strong vested interest in suppressing the truth. Whether it is Peter Citron, past pub­ lisher Harold Andersen, or underlings who have their positions only because of Andersen, their linkage to Franklin dictates that they use the best tool available, the World-Herald, to tell the public what they want them to believe. Because of its virtual monopoly as a news source, something repeated often enough by the World-Herald may attain the status of truth in the minds of those who read it. In the case of Franklin, the paper has repeated a simple theme, shaped by its top personnel-that the Franklin sex scandal, pedophilia and drug abuse stories were trumped up. I can present certain facts, never publicly revealed before now, that exemplify the program of deception carried on by the World-Herald throughout the Franklin scandal, continuing to the present. In coverage of the DeCamp memo, and in other Franklin coverage, the impression given by the World-Herald was that the legislative committee to investigate Franklin, headed by 95"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"96 • THE FRANKLIN COVER-UP Senator Schmit, was functioning in an irresponsible manner, allowing leaks to the press and to others.

I was providing information to the committee, as committee records will bear out. Probably the best example of this would be the detailed breakdowns of Franklin Credit Union financial transactions, which the committee received from me, months in advance of their own investigation. How did I get such data? Believe it or not, I got them from the chief counsel of the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), Robert Fenner. In an unsolicited phone call from him, Fenner gave me details about Franklin's secret accounts. In retrospect, I believe he wanted-through me-to throw cold water on the questions that were heating up in Omaha, about the role of Franklin monies in the Iran-Contra money-laundering schemes. At the time, I asked Fenner if he wanted me to share his information with Senator Schmit, which he did. I immediately drafted a detailed memo of my conversation with Fenner. I provided the information to Senator Schmit, for the legislative committee. I gave Fenner's phone number to Schmit.

A banner headline in the World-Herald trumpeted: \"Grand Jury Says Abuse Stories Were a 'Carefully Crafted Hoax'.\" The conclusions presented in the 42-page \"Grand Jury Re­ port,\" not to mention the pretentious language in which it discounted whole areas of the Franklin case, betray the delibera­ tions of the jury, rather, as a carefully crafted cover-up. The grand jury gave opinions on a variety of matters. The Douglas County grand jury cleared Larry King of child abuse: We found no credible evidence of child sexual abuse, inter­ state transportation of minors, drug trafficking or participa­ tion in a pornography ring by King or other Franklin officials or employees. To the extent that homosexual relations occur­ red involving such employees or officials, the evidence we were able to uncover showed these exchanges to be voluntary acts between persons above the age of consent. Yes, Larry King had diverted credit union funds for his personal gain, but \"it is our opinion that federal authorities are better able to pursue matters regarding this misappropriation of credit union funds, and we strongly recommend that they"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"COVER·UP PHASE II: THE GRAND JURY • continue to do so.\" And although \"we also found probable cause to believe that King, on numerous occasions, used money or items of value to 'entice, inveigle, persuade, encourage or procure' men in their late teens or early twenties to engage in acts of prostitution with him, and, therefore, he committed the crime of pandering,\" the statute of limitations had run out on many of these acts, and \"our ultimate decision was that to charge and try King with a class IV felony under state law when he is facing 40 felony counts in federal court [on financial charges only] would not be the best use of the resources of the Douglas County District Court, and again we have deferred to the federal prosecution.\" So careful was this grand jury not to fritter public resources, that it did not even subpoena Larry King! The grand jury explained away its failure to call King as a witness: Because King is presently in an institution out of the state pursuant to an order from the federal court, and because we believed he would rely on his right against self-incrimination ... , we decided it would not be fruitful to attempt to require King to appear before us. Whenever it did admit that abuse had taken place, the grand jury stipulated that none of it had anything to do with the Franklin Credit Union. The grand jury indicted three people. First came Alan Baer, the department store heir, one of the five persons named in the DeCamp memo. We did have testimony from certain witnesses about sexual involvement with Baer. Evidence also showed that these witnesses received substantial amounts of money or other valuables in exchange for sex .... Therefore, we believe Baer committed the offense of pandering, and we have handed down an indictment against him for that offense. However that may be, the grand jury added, \"We have found no direct connection between Alan Baer and King or the Franklin Credit Union, other than limited social and busi­ ness dealings.\" 107"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"108 • THE FRANKLIN COVER-UP Peter Citron, another of the five I named, appeared before the grand jury and was found to have had \"inappropriate sexual contact with male minors,\" but again, \"no connection has been found to link Citron with the Franklin Credit Union .... \" Citron had already been indicted and convicted for these contacts in a separate court process. The other two people indicted were the victim-witnesses, Alisha Owen and Paul Bonacci. These young people had suf­ fered, admitted the grand jury, but that had nothing to do with Franklin: \"We think that Owen might have been sexually abused during her early years, but not by the people and in the way she has alleged.\" As for Bonacci, \"according to his testimony, he was a child victim of repeated sexual abuse by persons not associated with the Franklin investigation.\" Accusing them of lying to the grand jury during May and June of 1990, the jury handed down indictments against Owen on eight counts of perjury and against Bonacci on three counts. Troy Boner and Danny King, the other two main witnesses taped by Caradori, recanted in the spring of 1990. The Douglas County grand jury made no mention of the fact that by retractin their testimony to Caradori, the two were saying that they lie to the Legislature, whose representative Caradori was. The grand jury noted that in a May 1990 interim report, it had recommended \"that the Washington County Attorney charge Jarrett Webb with third degree sexual assault of a minor,\" namely Nelly Patterson Webb. Where Nelly had reported organized abuse and prostitution, however, she was not to be believed: In early 1986, Nelly began to expand her allegations by charging that she had been taken by King on flights to other cities such as Chicago and Washington, D.C. where she was \"put on display\" at parties where sex and illegal drug activities took place. We interviewed a number of witnesses who traveled extensively with King, and a few made what must have been embarrassing admissions about engaging in sexual contact with King on some of these trips. However, no witness before the Grand Jury could confirm in any way that Nelly Webb or any other children were ever transported"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"COVER-UP PHASE II: THE GRAND JURY • for any illegal purposes and we found no evidence to support these claims. Addressing other dimensions ofthe Webbs' house of horrors, the grand jury offered its opinion that it was \"unfortunate that so much time elapsed between the first allegations of abuse and the time that the last children were removed from the home.\" It then faulted Carol Stitt of the Foster Care Review Board for writing to the state attorney general so promptly about Loretta Smith's reports, instead of first making more inquiries on her own! But Attorney General Spire had \"appro­ priately passed the information on to [Law Enforcement chief] William Howland,\" and any delays past that point must have been due to Howland's heavy workload, in the jury's opinion. Loretta Smith, who testified before the grand jury, had \"suf­ fered more abuse and neglect than anyone should ever have to endure,\" but \"the perpetrators of such abuse may never be known.\" In any event, \"the Grand Jury found no evidence to substantiate any connection between King, or any Franklin personnel, and the alleged illegal activities described by the girl.\" The grand jury report contained gratuitous pronouncements such as that \"children do have the right to expect that if they exhibit reasonable behavior, they will not be abused.\" (Empha­ sis added.) It casually mentioned that, according to the OPD, there were \"over 500 known pedophiles in the Omaha area.\" (Since the U.S. Department of Justice estimates that a typical pedophile molests 77 children before he is caught, and most are never caught, a contingent of 500 pedophiles would be abusing thou­ sands of children every year!) One pedophile even caused us [grand jury members] to be greatly concerned. This individual, Robert W. Andresen, a white male, 6'5\", 325 lbs., has been known to coerce males (including male minors) to his residence. Once he has taken a male there, he may sexually assault and/or pornographically photograph 109"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"110 • THE FRANKLIN COVER·UP the young man. Furthermore, we have reviewed documents that state Andresen has threatened to physically hann his victim(s) and has threatened to search out and kill those who report him to the authorities. Having painted that bloodcurdling portrait, the grand jury dismissed the matter with a wave: \"Unfortunately, because the victims refused to testify against him, we could not indict.\" In reality, Andresen figured in the taped testimony of Troy Boner and Danny King to Gary Caradori, which the grand jury ne­ glected to say. The grand jury charged that the \"hoax\" was spread by certain \"rumormongers\"; among these, it named two child care work­ ers, to whom the victims had begun to speak. In the opinion of the grand jury, \"Perhaps never in the history of Douglas County has the discordant multitude played so feverishly upon the rumor pipe as in the allegations of sexual misconduct rounding Franklin.\" All those who had pursued the allegations, such as Senator Schmit and the Franklin committee, Senator Chambers, this writer, members of the Concerned Parents, and a free-lance journalist named Michael Casey, came under attack from the grand jury. But, in a striking variation from normal grand jury procedure-to either indict an individual or not to name him at all-this jury cleared, by name, all the prominent alleged abusers, including Judge Theodore Carlson, Harold Andersen, former Game and Parks Commissioner Eugene Mahoney, Omaha Mayor P.J. Morgan, and Omaha lawyer Thomas McKenney. As for alleged abuser Chief Robert Wadman, the jury observed, \"We now look upon Owen as the perpetrator and Wadman as the victim.\" According to the grand jury, one of the perpetrators did not even exist: \"Owen repeatedly referred to a bodyguard and enforcer of King's nicknamed 'Larry the Kid.' We believe this muscular, black male, in his late teens or early twenties, to be a fictitious character.\" The report did not explain, how a fabricated personality could have appeared in reports from at least four different children over a period of three years. Loretta Smith told about a person named King Horse, who was at"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"COVER·UP PHASE II: THE GRAND JURY • parties and rituals she attended in 1985. Alisha Owen testified that Larry King's \"henchman\" was a black youth named \"Larry (Lnuk)\", also known as Kings Horses. Danny King said \"Larry, Jr.\" was King's righthand man. And Paul Bonacci reported that a black man he called \"Larry Little King\" would carry out threats on Larry King's behalf. Finally, the report insisted that there was no cover-up. There are citizens who believe that prominent individuals, allegedly associated with this case, are automatically guilty because of their public stature. They also believe that the public stature of these individuals allows automatic protec­ tion and the power to cover up situations. While we agreed that this was a possibility, our investigation found nothing to substantiate any of these allegations. There is no evidence of a cover up. The Douglas County grand jury said it \"spent the most time\" and \"the majority of our fact finding and deliberative effort,\" on refuting the videotaped testimony assembled by Gary Cara­ dori. It concluded, \"There is no doubt after reviewing all rele­ vant evidence, that the story of sexual abuse, drugs, prostitution, and judicial bribery presented in the legislative videotapes is a carefully crafted hoax, scripted by a person or persons with considerable knowledge of the people and institutions of Omaha, including personal relationships and shortcomings.\" With Caradori, as Senator Schmit put it, \"conveniently no longer alive to defend himself,\" the grand jury insinuated that he had staged the tapes for personal profit: We have scrutinized Caradori's investigative techniques. In too many instances individuals Caradori interviewed were \"fed\" items of information. He led his witnesses and the videotapes were stopped and started at suspicious intervals with the substance of the witnesses' stories changing. Cara­ dori stated that he thought it was his job to find the leads and it was someone else's responsibility to follow them up. We believe to the contrary. We think that Caradori stood to gain professionally and personally from the outcome. Caradori spent more time supporting the allegations rather III"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"112 • THE FRANKLIN COVER-UP than verifying the same. Caradori worked from a sensational base. If there appeared to be something that would be scan­ dalous, he was interested in following it through. If it was just a routine matter, he was not willing to invest the neces­ sary time or effort. In October 1990, Karen Ormiston, the employee of Cara­ dori's investigative firm who was with him at the videotapings, passed a polygraph test administered by Chris Gugas, a profes­ sional polygraph specialist from San Diego who was President of the National Polygraph Association. The questions to which she answered \"no,\" were: \"1. During Gary Caradori's inter­ views with the Franklin case victims, did he ever threaten anyone in obtaining information from them? 2. To the best of your knowledge, did Gary coach any of the alleged Franklin case victims on what they should say in their interviews? 3. Did Gary and you advise any of the four victims at anytime to fabricate their stories?\" To the question, \"Were all the state­ ments given to you and Gary by the four Franklin case victims completely voluntary?\" she answered \"yes.\" Gugas concluded, \"[I]t is the opinion of this examiner that Ms. Ormiston answered all of the above relevant questions truthfully,\" One of Caradori's close associates said after his death, \"We never thought these tapes represented more than a tiny part of the overall story. They are important, but the Franklin case has been turned into a debate on the tapes.\" The collaborator was talking about the investigation's reach into high political circles and into Washington D.C., but the point applies also to the use of the tapes themselves. The bad faith of the grand jury's dismissal of Caradori's work comes even more into relief, if contrasted with the reams of evidence in the investigator's files, which the grand jury apparently failed to consider. By no means satisfied with the taped statements as they stood, the meticulous Caradori listed, at the end of each interview precis, dozens of leads for follow-up and cross-checking. A small excerpt demonstrates his exhaustive investigative agenda: 6. Records from what was formerly Brandeis to determine the payment of the dress and teddy that Wadman bought Alisha."},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"• • • COVER·UP PHASE II: THE GRAND JURY • 7. The bartender who was present at the French Cafe when Alisha had lunch with Wadman. 8. The kitchen help who was employed at the French Cafe at the time that Alisha and Wadman had lunch there. 23. Fuel records for the private planes that Alisha took. This would indicate where the plane fueled up, especially on flights to the west coast. 24. David Hughes; a pilot named by Alisha as one of Larry King's favorite pilots. Caradori did not trace through many of these leads, because he died. But the grand jury waved them aside. The jury's report says that it \"heard live testimony from 76 witnesses\" in all. Caradori's notes on the Alisha Owen and Troy Boner tapes alone, list over 75 people to be interviewed during follow-up, not counting Alisha and Troy. Caradori's evidence, the originals of which occupy a whole locked room at the statehouse, comprise cross-indexed binders, boxes of files, hundreds of hours of audiotapes as well as the videotapes, and a list of 291 potential witnesses in all. The grand jury had a full set in its possession. I do know, who from Caradori' s potential witness lists was called before the panel, because I was one of the few people who ultimately had access to this information. I am forbidden from identifying these people. As I have said, I believe that if the entire grand jury testimony could be made public, that would be in the public interest. I also believe that, if that were done, there would be a follow­ up grand jury to investigate the original grand jury. The Grand Jury Report met with outrage. Trish Lanphier, head of the Concerned Parents group, two of whose founders were denounced as \"rumormongers\" by the grand jury, blasted the indictment of Alisha Owen and Paul Bonacci: \"This is a sick grand jury. Turning the victim into the perpetrator. This is so classic.\" 113"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"114 • THE FRANKLIN COVER-UP Phone calls against the jury's findings poured into a local TV station, as reported in the Omaha Metro Update of July 30: \"The day after the grand jury report hit on Tuesday, July 24, an 'unscientific' viewer phone-in poll by Omaha television station KETV Channel 7 indicated 10-1 viewer dissatisfaction with the grand jury report. More than 3,000 responses were tallied.\" The jury claimed-without having called me to testify­ that I had \"issued [my] memorandum for personal political gain and possible revenge for past actions against [me].\" I filed a civil suit, charging that the jury's statements \"were malicious, intentional, negligent and done in ... violation of [my] clearly established constitutional and statutory rights.\" Senator Chambers submitted a \"Motion to Expunge\" to the Douglas County District Court, accompanied by an 83-page supporting brief, which documented the jury's gross irregular­ ities. The legislative Franklin committee's official response to the jury's report raised a question which the jury had carefully left unanswered. \"We assume from their choice of words­ carefully crafted hoax,\" the Franklin committee said, \"that the Grand Jury was persuaded that the testimony of the witnesses corroborated each other, and included facts and circumstances which were readily verifiable and attested to by other witnesses. Otherwise, it could not be logically deemed 'carefully crafted.' If it was carefully crafted, who crafted it and when?\" In addition, the committee observed, \"Alisha Owen and Paul Bonacci are charged with perjury and Troy Boner and Danny King are not. As we see it, the victims who stand by their story are charged with perjury, while those that have admitted to false statements before the Committee [in the videotaped testi­ mony] are not. That makes little sense to us. Either all of them should have been indicted or none of them. The message is mixed and appears to favor encouraging the recanting as a way to avoid the hazards of criminal prosecution. It also tells persons they can lie under oath to Legislative Committees, so long as they change their story before they get to court.\""},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"• • • COVER·UP PHASE II: THE GRAND JURY • The Omaha World-Herald, whose society columnist Citron stood convicted of child molestation while its former publisher, Andersen, was whitewashed in the grand jury report, leaped to the jury's defense. \"Grand Jury Did Its Job; The Insults Are Intolerable,\" blared its lead editorial on July 29, 1990. Rumors of wrongdoing and coverup in the Franklin case were rampant last winter. Based on the conclusions of the Douglas County grand jury, it now appears that the rumors resulted from the fantasies of liars, hoaxers and opportunists who wanted to pay back their perceived political enemies. Because of the rumors last winter, however, the faith of much of the public in its institutions was shaken. At one time, there seemed no way to determine the truth. How fortunate Nebraska was to have the grand jury sys­ tem to help it get to the truth. Now, however, the grand jury system itself is under at­ tack. The grand jurors who constituted the Douglas County body are being insulted. Doubts are being cast upon their integrity. The barrage continued, with an August 2, 1990 World-Her­ ald editorial, \"Schmit Panel Can't Duck Responsibility in Hoax\": Loran Schmit is frantically rewriting history as he urges the public to believe that his Franklin committee doesn't deserve the criticism it was given by the Douglas County grand jury. . . . Senator Schmit, you and other people connected with the committee haven't been putting evidence together prop­ erly since the day committee investigator Gary Caradori made the videotapes that became part of the Franklin story . . . . Schmit clearly had his mind made up on the credibility of many of the stories on the videotapes. By June, still sticking by his view that the stories were believable, he was insinuating that \"money is being spent\" to block the indictments of prominent people.

The World-Herald evidently hoped that the \"wild tale\" about prostitution and a cover-up had been laid to rest by the grand jury. The more that became known about that panel, however, the more obvious it was that the grand jury itself, guided by prosecutor Samuel Van Pelt, was adding to the cover-up, and had systematically leaked sensitive information, buried crucial evidence, and threatened witnesses. In my opinion, never was a case of control and abuse of institutions of government and cover-up of crime executed more perfectly, than in the calling and handling of this grand jury. A grand jury can be the best or the worst device to uncover crime. First, everything in a grand jury is supposed to be secret. Second, the prosecutor in charge of the grand jury can do about as he pleases, in presenting or screening information. If a corrupt or incompetent prosecutor is in charge, the result will correspond to his behavior. Third, if the grand jury is controlled by corrupt forces, as I believe this one was, then they may use the grand jury as a means to find out what people know about the matter under scrutiny, by calling them as witnesses, without any of that information becoming public. Then such information can be used to assist in a cover-up. The so-called recantations of Troy Boner and Danny King appear to be a case in point. Nebraska may have the worst laws in the United States, on the use of the grand jury system. They contribute to corruption and cover-up, rather than proper investigation and indictment. At an October 14-15, 1991 hearing in the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Paul, Minnesota, this fact was exploited by the Nebraska Attorney General's Office, which was defending Douglas County Prosecutor Van Pelt and the grand jury fore­ man in the Franklin case, Michael Flanagan, before a three­ judge panel that was questioning them. The state's argument"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"• • • COVER-UP PHASE II: THE GRAND JURY • was that the poor quality and ambiguity of Nebraska state laws on the use of grand juries at the county level should exempt the prosecutor and the foreman from responsibility for any errors or wrongdoing committed by the grand jury. All grand jury testimony remains sealed. The evidence given here of the jury's role in the cover-up comes from the public domain; it is a fraction of the story. Concern that the grand jury was rigged arose even before it was chosen, just as soon as retired judge Van Pelt was named as special prosecutor for the Franklin case at the county level. On March 12, 1990, the Lincoln Journal ran a letter from 43 neighbors of the late Cairo, Nebraska farmer and political activ­ ist Arthur Kirk, in which they termed Van Pelt \"a hired gun for the state.\" The group charged that Van Pelt had covered up the 1984 death of Kirk at the hands of a State Police SWAT squad, which they called murder. In that case, they wrote, \"Van Pelt simply took the statements of the perpetrators, put them in his report and exonerated them of any wrongdoing. He did exactly what he was paid and hired to do.\" Gross irregularities in Van Pelt's investigation of Kirk's death were noted by Senator Ernie Chambers and others at the time. The police, for instance, claimed that Kirk fired first. If he had, their claim to have fired in self-defense might have held water; yet no ballistics tests were done to see if Kirk had fired his weapon at all! Kirk's wife charged that she had been used by the state police to lure Kirk out of his house, so he could be gunned down. \"I came to realize that they had used me against my own husband. I had been used as a decoy,\" she was quoted in Lindsey Williams' 1987 book, Where' s the Food? Despite glaring contradictions in the SWAT team's story, Van Pelt found that the police had acted in self-defense. The World-Herald retaliated against the Cairo citizens' let­ ter, with an all-out defense of Van Pelt. The March 17, 1990 lead editorial, \"Van Pelt's Report on Kirk Followed the Evi­ dence,\" lamented, \"The sad fact of the matter is that some 117"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"118 • THE FRANKLIN COVER-UP people cling to wild, sensational rumors and conspiracy theories even in the absence of any rational basis.\" • Van Pelt's behavior during the Franklin grand jury was no rumor, but a matter of record. Three people who testified before the grand jury-Paul Bonacci, Alisha Owen, and a young woman called \"Jane Doe\"-subsequently charged that Van Pelt intimidated them and attempted to force them to change their testimony. Paul Bonacci testified before the Legislature's Franklin com­ mittee on October 16, 1990, about his grand jury experience. BONACCI: And the other thing is they kept saying when I was in front of the-that-some-that jury or whatever, they kept telling me to-that if I stuck to my story they were going to make me be in trouble for it.

OWEN: I-you know, as I said before, they never talked to me about 1983 and 1984. They don't even know what happened. They-they send me into this grand jury, they are calling me a perjurer and they have never even asked me what happened. And when-it's kind of hard for me because I want people to know I'm telling the truth, and sometimes some of the things that you have to tell them about what happened or about the perpetrators is difficult. And it would be, I think, a gross injustice if that evidence was suppressed. The fact that I know about the bunion or the knot on his little toe and he has hair on his toes, you know, I can tell you exactly how the hair patches on his feet are, it would be a gross injustice if that was suppressed in the grand jury. I think that would-that would be absolutely a crime. Because in the United States today when it comes to those kinds of cases, a lot of times the only way that a victim can actually prove that they were abused is by identifying key marks on that person's body that no one else would know.

I had about 25 minutes for a statement the first time, and they had about that many questions. Mr. Van Pelt said they didn't have any further need for my appearance up there. And I thought that was sort of strange in view of the fact that we spent a year and a half at this, we have spent hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of hours, and [the Franklin committee] could answer all their questions. And I might, without revealing anything that was asked, might add that most of the questions that were asked of me, I think [Franklin committee counsel] Mr. Berry is here, had little or nothing to do with the scope of the investigation. And the second time around, when I appeared at my request, it was more of the same. And it's a rather disappoint­ ing situation when you realize that if you are hunting for something and you do not look where you know the evidence is, you're not going to find it. In my civil suit, I charged that Van Pelt and Dougherty had even participated in writing the grand jury's final report, a practice forbidden by Nebraska law. Jury foreman Michael Flanagan admitted their involvement, as the World-Herald re­ ported on August 21, 1990: Flanagan emphasized that the grand jurors participated equally and actively in the writing of the report, dividing"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"COVER-UP PHASE II: THE GRAND JURY • the writing into small groups and then meeting again and again as a whole to \"polish and polish\" the text.

It was a completely joint effort.\" The grand jury explained that its failure to subpoena Larry King was due to the probability that King would have invoked his Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate himself. In other cases, it was fine with Van Pelt to call witnesses who would take the fifth, as he indicated to Jane Doe in the exchange reported by the Nebraska Observer: On the return trip home, Mr. Van Pelt told Jane Doe about the \"easy day\" coming up the next day. When she asked why, he disclosed to her that the witness would \"plead the Fifth.\" She said, \"He told me that he was a homosexual and that he had sex with little boys. And that they would indict him on that, so the fact is that he had to plead the Fifth so he would not get indicted.\" Van Pelt said it would be an easy day \"because he wouldn't have to do anything,\" except \"just sit there and listen to those guys plead the Fifth through­ out the questions.\" ... That exchange, in addition to consisting of inappropriate disclosure by Mr. Van Pelt, is in sharp contrast to the Jury's refusal to subpoena Larry King, \"because ... he would rely on his right against self-incrimination,\" and therefore, would not be fruitful to attempt to require King to appear before (the Grand Jury).\" [Emphasis in original.] • Van Pelt's treatment of Jane Doe caused such a public outcry, that Douglas County prosecutor Ronald Staskiewicz felt com­ pelled to conduct an investigation.

He had handled the child molesta­ tion trial of World-Herald society columnist Peter Citron. After Citron's conviction, Sigler maintained that the Citron case had never been linked with the Franklin investigation \"in the begin­ ning, middle, or end. That's not what this case is about.\" He told the World-Herald. \"It had nothing to do with Franklin, the evidence uncovered didn't show any link. That's a big misconception.\" Neither was Sigler disqualified from responsibility to probe Van Pelt's performance, by the fact that two witnesses to the Legislature's Franklin committee witnesses had placed him in the Franklin case! On June 10, 1990, Karen Ormiston interviewed one Alice Good*, who had information on pornography and prostitution. Ormiston recorded, \"The subject feels that a Douglas County prosecuting attorney identified as Robert Seigler [sic], nick­ named 'Smiley,' is involved with the Franklin case.\" Paul Bonacci was more specific, in testimony given to the Franklin committee on June 12, 1990. BONACCI: With Larry King I've traveled a lot of times to Kansas City, and that was usually by car. But we used to go up to Sioux City, Iowa and we used to take a-there was a chartered plane. It was called KAM Air or something. And they used to fly us up to Sioux City and we'd stay at a hotel that was right on the river. And he had a boat and stuff we used to go on all the time.

In the days before his death, Rogers told friends that he was very afraid of what King would do to him, and that if anything happened to him, to contact Robert Sigler. The Douglas County grand jury said it \"spent a considerable amount of time investigating all aspects of Rogers' death,\" but concluded it had nothing to do with Larry King. Sigler's friend and associate in the law firm, Gerald Moran, later also joined the Douglas County attorney's office. In 1991, he ran the prosecution of Alisha Owen for perjury. Sigler promptly reported back to Staskiewicz, that Van Pelt had done nothing wrong. From the outset, Paul Bonacci presented a huge obstacle for the Douglas County grand jury. Since Bonacci refused to recant what he had testified to Caradori, Van Pelt's jury was compelled to indict him for perjury, in order to maintain that the story of Franklin-connected abuse was a carefully crafted hoax. It was difficult to see how Bonacci could have participated with Owen in the fabrication of such a hoax. Caradori did not even meet him until May 10, 1990, and took his videotaped statement for the Franklin committee on May 14-five days after Owen finished testifying before the grand jury. Bonacci's recollections corroborated Alisha's on many points, although he told Caradori that he thought the last time he had spoken with her was in 1986. Since his testimony supported Owen's, the grand jury had to call Bonacci a liar: Bonacci was perhaps the most pathetic witness to appear during the entire proceedings. . .. He has been diagnosed as having multiple personalities, and his psychiatrist doubts that he can tell the truth. His many inconsistencies and contradictions render his testimony unbelievable and neces­ sitate his indictment for perjury. This tortured formula contained not one, but two contradic­ tions. Obviously, a person who was medically incapable of 125"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"126 • THE FRANKLIN COVER-UP telling the truth could not also be guilty of perjury, or deliberate lying under oath. The second error, however, was to cite the alleged opinion of \"Bonacci's psychiatrist,\" who did not appear as a witness before the grand jury. It was a stretch even to apply this label to the doctor in question, Dr. Beverly Mead, since he examined Bonacci on behalf of the Omaha Police Department. But where Dr. Mead did testify, before the Frank­ lin committee, he said he believed Bonacci to be telling the truth! Dr. Judianne Densen-Gerber, New York-area psychiatrist, lawyer, child abuse expert and member of the International Society of Multiple Personality and Dissociative States, has described the ailment Bonacci suffers from, Multiple Personal­ ity Disorder (MPD). It is not a psychosis, she said, but a neurosis, that results from a defense mechanism in the mind of a child seeking to protect himself from \"unimaginable atrocity.\" Virtually all MPD victims were severely abused starting before they were six years old, with tortures such as being hung upside down and having hot objects stuck inside them, or being forced to participate in the murder, mutilation and cannibalism of other children. A child subjected to such terrible emotional and physical pain has no possibity of escape from this \"emotional Auschwitz,\" so his mind, in self-defense, invents another iden­ tity at the moment of abuse and suffering. Through this mecha­ nism, the child victim can imagine he is someone else, looking at the pain and betrayal from the outside, as if it were not actually happening to him. As the victim grows older, these different personalities survive in the victim's mind, each having its own age, name, memories and characteristics. Multiple Personality Disorder is familiar to many people from Flora Rheta Schreiber's book Sybil, about the first MPD victim who ever reintegrated her personality through psychoanalysis. \"Sybil,\" tortured since infancy by her mother, first sought a psy­ chiatrist's help as a young woman in Omaha, Nebraska. Invited to Omaha by the Legislature's Franklin committee, Dr. Densen-Gerber testified on December 29, 1990 about her examination of Paul Bonacci. She was questioned by committee counsel Robert Creager."},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"COVER·UP PHASE II: THE GRAND JURY • CREAGER: Doctor, I believe the grand jury actually went so far as to pin their conclusion on a \"fact\" that according to testimony Mr. Bonacci was not capable of telling the truth. Do you have a comment on that? DENSEN-GERBER: I think it would be very difficult for Mr. Bonacci to lie .... Being a multiple personality there is no need to lie, you switch [personalities] .... First of all, Mr. Bonacci's story is an average story for someone in Mr. Bonacci's circumstances. There is nothing that Bonacci told me that I haven't heard from other patients or individuals. He has no elaborations and he often says I don't know. He does not fabricate or he does not try to provide answers which most people do because they want to please. He doesn't even give you the impression that he wants to please. Police-hired psychiatrist Dr. Beverly Mead concurred, when he answered questions from senators and Bonacci's attorney, this writer, at an October 1990 hearing before the Franklin committee. DECAMP: What do you believe now, Doctor, relative to his discussions here that we've heard and the ones you and I have listened to? MEAD: I personally feel that these details that he's related to us were experiences that he really experienced .... SENATOR SCHMIT: I have several questions of Dr. Mead. Doctor, we heard the witness in various personalities men­ tion some specific names of persons who were with him at various times, Larry King, Robert Wadman. ... In your professional experience, is there-how do you-I guess my question is do you feel those descriptions are accurate? MEAD: I would like to see them confirmed from other sources, of course. But it's-it's my present impression that Paul is-or [personality] Alexandrew is reporting things honestly as he remembers them. SCHMIT: Is there any way that he could have imagined this and dreamed it up and then told it to us here today? Could that have been done? MEAD: It would be a most phenomenal trick to do that. I don't think it would be possible. I think he's talking about 127"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"128 • THE FRANKLIN COVER·UP things that he actually remembers .... In our effort to remem­ ber something, sometimes we may say, well, I think so-and­ so, and as we think about it we come to believe it. So there might be a few details that are not precisely as happened. But I think basically the story as he tells it is what he is honestly reporting. SCHMIT: For example, the story about his trip to the South­ fork ranch [with Larry King, during the Republican national convention, to be sexually abused], do you believe that story? MEAD: Yes. Finally, the credibility of Paul Bonacci is bolstered by his own action in April of 1986, two years before there was a Franklin case, when he reported to the Omaha Police Depart­ ment and to officials of his high school, that he was abused by Harold Andersen, Larry King, Alan Baer, and others. Henry Rosenthal, then Bonacci's attorney, spoke to the Franklin com­ mittee about this on June 21, 1990. ROSENTHAL: I talked to his people at school, you know, because I-I had some severe doubts about this fellow telling me about that. But his problem-one day he went kind of outer space in school and they thought it was drugs and it really wasn't. This stuff was really starting to work on him. He just did not want to recruit anymore for Mr. Baer. SENATOR LABEDZ: He told us that. ROSENTHAL: But I talked to the school officials. You are talking about assistant principal at school, how many people, 4,000 students. I talked to his head counselor and they said it's absolutely true.

One thing I told the Attorney General ... is that I don't want Larry King to commit suicide and I don't want any accidents that will take him out. What he's doing he has not done by himself and couldn't do by himself.\" With over forty years in the Legislature between them, Schmit and Chambers knew whereof they spoke.

I had really great, great people who were counselors and teachers, who were over some of the major companies in the city. And I would go to them and ask them what they thought I should do and sometimes they would come and sit down or send someone out to talk with us. Harold Andersen of the World-Herald was one of the great people who came out. Bill Fitzgerald at Commercial Federal Savings and Loan. I called him once years ago when we were in a crisis and he said, \"I'Il be there at 7:30 tomorrow morning.\" And so he was. So I have to say the Omaha power structure has some of the best people to work with. They'll help you if they're convinced you want to help Omaha. They don't tum their backs: they have never done it to me. And I appreciate it because I like being a part of what makes this city grow, and this country. Had the \"Omaha power structure\" merely extended a liberal hand to a young black man trying to get ahead? For some of the city's elite, perhaps that's all there was to it. Days and even weeks after the raid, some of Franklin's backers were still defending King. The World-Herald of No­ vember 9, 1988 quoted its own publisher, Harold Andersen, Ken Power of US West Communications, and Lyn Wallin Ziegenbein of the Kiewit Foundation, in praise of King. \"Until the day it closed, Franklin was performing a useful purpose,\" Harold Andersen said on November 30, 1988. Yet someone making even a casual inquiry-such as a busi­ nessman might be expected to do before he contributed or deposited hundreds of thousands of dollars in a credit union­ would quickly hear the kind of warning Boys Town social worker Julie Walters did, when she asked around about King. They would have heard he was a dangerous man, and they would have heard about pornography, drugs, and pedophilia. Some, at least, of these \"great people\" from the major compa­ nies, had to know precisely what they were doing when they sponsored Larry King."},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"-------- • • • THE OMAHA BUSINESS COMMUNITY • In Gary Caradori's files is the transcript of a February 12, 1989 phone conversation with Sheila McGuire, aka Sheila Cal­ der, former manager of the French Cafe, who had moved to the West Coast. This night spot, partly owned by Larry King, was named by victim-witnesses as a center of sexual abuse. Alisha Owen told Caradori that \"Sheila Calder would arrange parties at the French Cafe during the afternoon when the cafe was closed.\" Here is what the hostess had to say: We had parties in my apartment above the French Cafe. Larry King would wine and dine potential investors down­ stairs at the Cafe. When the French Cafe closed about 1 AM, King and his man called Parking Lot Bob-who worked for him (and was our coke connection)-would bring people upstairs to my place. If Larry King investors wanted drugs, booze, children or hookers (male or female) we'd get them. While these guests of Kings took their pleasures-with the kids or whoever-King would sit and watch-while he drank, did coke and played with his young boys .... One time, when this guy Irv from NYC wanted Sandra­ who was about 12 or 13 years old and getting her 1st period, Larry intervened when Sandra refused. King pulled out a roll of $100.00 bills and gave Sandra 5 of them. King then pulled out a small gram of coke and gave that to Sandra. Sandra finally agreed and went off to bed with Irv. King took good care of the local and out of town high rollers. If you had the money to invest at Franklin, King would cater to your most deranged perversion. And, let me tell you another thing. The boys in the board rooms around Omaha are s---ing in their Brogans. If this case gets cracked open the list of involved will read like Who's Who. King and his crew have ruined a lot of childrens' lives. Two years after the raid on King's credit union, as the legislative Franklin committee's original term drew to a close, an old hand in Nebraska politics reflected on the events of the past 24 months. \"The Omaha business community,\" he said, 131"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"132 • THE FRANKLIN COVER·UP \"the Ak-Sar-Ben crowd, has really closed ranks behind Alan Baer, Andersen and the rest of them. The word has gone out: layoff the Franklin investigation. Most of the Senators are terrified. These guys make and break political careers. They give a lot of campaign money, and many of the Senators get what are generously called 'consulting fees,' or sometimes positions-no-show jobs, really-with the big firms up there. That's the way it's done. It's not uncommon for a big company to have more than one Senator on a $50,000 retainer.\" Who were \"these guys,\" the Ak-Sar-Ben crowd? Visit the Omaha Public Library to look up the boards of directors of big Omaha companies, and you will find names that are listed on board after board. Take a few of those-say, Walter Scott, Jr., chairman and CEO of the construction giant, Peter Kiewit and Sons Corporation; Charles \"Mike\" Harper, chairman and CEO of the $20 billion per year food conglomer­ ate ConAgra; Michael H. Walsh, CEO of Union Pacific Rail­ road, a major force in Nebraska for over a hundred years­ and ask the librarian to help find information on these men. The reply will likely be something like what one library staffer told a friend of mine in 1991: \"These are businessmen all right, but they are intensely secretive. We have very little on them.\" For over a century, the Omaha business community has been organized around the Knights of Ak-Sar-Ben, a quasi­ freemasonic social organization, centered on a racetrack and fairgrounds in Omaha. Spell \"Nebraska\" backwards and you get its name. Founded in 1895, Ak-Sar-Ben functions as a sort of central committee of the corporate elite, and a self-perceived oligarchy for the city. Every year Ak-Sar-Ben celebrates a ritual coronation of the \"King of Ak-Sar-Ben,' generally an older corporate executive, and his Queen, generally the younger wife or daughter of another man in the club. The king for 1990 was Mike Harper of ConAgra. Here, and at debutante balls and other affairs organized for the younger generation, the lords and ladies of Ak-Sar-Ben establish their social pecking order. The rituals and \"den shows\" mimic ceremonies from different lands, real and invented, and always pagan.

Ak-Sar-Ben's clout is so legendary, that Omaha Mayor P.J. Morgan, himself a member of the Ak-Sar-Ben social set, could make political hay by a demagogic attack on it. In 1990, during a squabble with Ak-Sar-Ben over where a new stadium would be constructed, Morgan blustered, \"Frankly, I'm just sick and tired of a small handful of people who think that they can control this city and county without regard to feelings, sentiments and desires of the honest, hard-working people who are the real foundation of this city.\" Sensitive to this widespread perception, ConAgra's Harper, speaking as chairman of Ak-Sar-Ben's Board of Governors, replied in a special World-Herald column on December 9, 1990, \"Ak Knights Don't Control City.\" Just because the indi­ viduals and corporations on Ak-Sar-Ben's board had given over $50 million to various causes over the past 20 years, wrote Harper, ticking off a list of most of the public facilities in Omaha, that did not mean they had clout. \"I am at a loss to see how contributions to reputable charities can be associated with political power.\" Harper's own company flaunted its political power over the city and the state, just a few years ago. According to \"Omaha Held Hostage,\" a May 1989 article in Progressive magazine, ConAgra threatened in 1987, to pull out of Omaha, unless the city granted it a choice piece of free land, sewage, paving and a host of other benefits, which will ultimately total as much as $60 million, for a new corporate headquarters. The city acquiesced. Later the same year, when the Nebraska Legislature was on the verge of removing personal property tax exemptions on purchases of jet airplanes and mainframe computers, Harper put out the word to the legislature: Change the tax bill, or ConAgra leaves Nebraska. The bill was changed. 133"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"134 • THE FRANKLIN COVER-UP Ak-Sar-Ben has been ruled for decades by its Board of Governors, a roster of sixteen influentials (increased to twenty, in 1990, \"to better represent the entire community,\" according to Mike Harper), most of whom are chief execu­ tives of major corporations. In the late 1980s, the board included: Charles \"Mike\" Harper, President and CEO, ConAgra William A.

These corporations poured millions into the Franklin Credit Union, in the form of deposits and outright contributions. Their executives supported King, in arrangements both informal and formal. Bill Fitzgerald, Knight of Ak-Sar-Ben and president of Com­ mercial Federal Savings and Loan, helped his friend Larry King with advice. When the jig was up for Franklin and the Consumer Services Organization, King's close associate CSO director Barbara Moore could find employment with Walter Scott's wife, Sue.

Ak-Sar-Ben interfaced with the Franklin credit union proper, but also with individuals in the orbit of Larry King. One of its biggest financial contributors in recent years was the department store heir and child abuser, Alan Baer. Catering for Ak-Sar­ Ben was Gary West, bartender from the Max gay bar. As the Legislature geared up to investigate the credit union, its lofty advisors began to jump ship. At the Legislature's Executive Board meeting of December 12, 1988, Senator Chambers captured the picture: This situation will be like the Nazi regime after it failed, nobody saw Hitler. nobody knew who Hitler was, but one kid once saw an old man who one time knew a guy who talked to a guy who saw a car drive by with curtains on it and somebody said Hitler was in that car. That's the way this is going to be, nobody knows anything, nobody has seen anything, nobody knows why investigations in the past, by the federal government, were terminated. Sure enough, over the next months one board member after another would appear on the pages of the World-Herald, to deny he had really had anything to do with Franklin. Virtually nobody from the powerful firms that channeled funds to Frank­ lin and advisers to its board, was ever questioned by the Franklin committee about his relations with the credit union. Once again, according to one veteran politician, the whiff of a ConAgra payoff was in the air: Those who helped cut short the Franklin investigation would receive campaign funding from ConAgra, and those who pursued it would not. For some of the Franklin board members, the ties to Larry King were too close to hide. Gary Caradori questioned one of them, Joseph Barker III of Massachusetts Mutual Insurance Co., on March 1, 1990. He wrote up their exchange:"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"THE OMAHA BUSINESS COMMUNITY • At 1400 this writer arrived at the Massachusetts Mutual Insurance Company located at 90th and Dodge, Omaha, Nebraska, and contacted Mr. Joe Barker. Mr. Barker then did admit to writing policies for Larry King and his family. He stated that as far as he knew, he handled all of Larry King's life insurance. Mr. Barker stated that he had known Larry King for many years. He was not certain how they met, however, they did share some duties on church commit­ tees and possibly several other boards .... When my ques­ tioning started to center around social gatherings,Mr. Barker indicated with a nervous gesture that yes, he had been to some social events with Larry King, but that everything was always \"on the up and up.\" He stated that throughout his friendship with Larry, everything was always \"straight\" and that he had never seen anything out of the ordinary. To the trained investigator, something didn't sit quite right. Caradori observed: This investigator noted that Mr. Barker seemed extremely uneasy while this writer was present. Further investigation will be conducted reference this matter. In other cases, Franklin Advisory Board members were one step removed from personal contact with King. One person from a company would sit on the board, while somebody else was more directly in touch. The law firm Byrne & Randall (credit union board member Carolyn Rothery) fit this pattern. Joseph Byrne handled much of King's legal business early in his career, and King used Byrne as a personal reference on credit applications, according to a February 17, 1989 report by Jerry Lowe. Byrne's partner, Gary Randall, was the lawyer who negotiated Jarrett and Barbara Webb's way out of trouble in 1986. Erickson, Sederstrom, Leigh, Eisenstatt, Johnson, Kinnamon (credit union board member Leo Eisenstatt) was retained by King and the credit union for various matters. Quoted by James Traub in a December 1991 article in Gentlemen's Quarterly, Leo Eisenstatt recalled, \"The Kings came to our house for dinner, and we went to their house. We were one big, happy family.\" 137"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"• • • 138 • THE FRANKLIN COVER·UP An employee of Erickson, Sederstrom, Leigh, Eisenstatt, et al., Jay Derr, came to the attention of Caradori and the Franklin committee, in connection with King's sexual escapades. Cara­ dori received reports from at least two sources, that Derr had taken a private flight with King to the 1988 Republican National Convention, where King organized one of his sex parties. In his notes of March 29, 1990, Caradori reported a local law enforcement officer receiving \"a call from the DEA in D.C. requesting help on Jay Derr.\" Then Paul Bonacci testified about him before the Franklin committee on June 12, 1990. SENATOR LYNCH: Does the name Jay Derr mean anything to you? BONACCI: Yeah, Derr I know. Jason Derr. SENATOR SCHMIT: Why is that name familiar to you? BONACCI: Well, there was a guy that was at some parties and stuff, he told me his name was Jason Derr. And that's all I remember.

Harold Andersen was King's biggest backer in the Omaha business community. He chaired Franklin's Advisory Board and co-chaired its fundraising drive, starting in 1983. These money-raising efforts lost some of their luster in 1989, when it was revealed that the money was used to build an addition to the credit union, the most prominent feature of which was a bedroom. The retreat was equipped with \"a brass bed, a fluffy white comforter, a stereo and a television,\" according to former Franklin employee Noel Seltzer, quoted in the March 5, 1989 Lincoln Journal. Others said King used it for afternoon trysts with his homosexual lovers. Andersen claimed that he did not know there was a bedroom in the addition he raised the money for, but Seltzer had a specific recollection, reported in the Village Voice: \"When the addition opened, credit union employees say, Andersen gave guided tours of the new building. 'He always walked by the door and it was open,' says Noel Seltzer, a former employee. 'He knew there was a bedroom in there, he had to see it. We did.' \" Seltzer told the Lincoln Journal, that during Andersen's opening-day tour, \"the door to the bedroom was open, ... although it was kept locked after that and the room was off limits to employees.\" For years before the fall, Andersen's World-Herald chroni­ cled the great works of Larry King and his associates. Its magazine, The Midlands, ran a feature article in 1983, full of praise for Franklin board member Jarrett Webb and his wife Barbara as model foster parents. The paper's incessant PR work for King, before and after the collapse of Franklin, was bitterly resented by many in Omaha's black community, as Senator Chambers said at the Executive Board session of December 12, 1988: This man that the World-Herald has pussy-footed around and tried to hold up as a role model for our children, a leader 139"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"• • 140 • THE FRANKLIN COVER·UP in our community, is a gross insult to us ... and I get tired of seeing World-Herald headlines about the leader of the credit union, things that try to indicate that he typifies what our community is .... In the community there is outrage that the appearance seems to be to try to keep this man looking like a decent, upstanding citizen. One of the pictures you'll see is where he was catering something for one of the Christ Child centers in Omaha to make it look like he's a great guy. You'll see an article that talks about how generously he gave for AIDs research. If I'm stealing your money, it is easy for me to be generous with that money. In the black community $100 for the Boys Club, $100 for the Girls Club. For a gay outfit in Washington, D.C., $18,000 at a pop .... So the reason I'm saying this is to indicate that I believe that the World-Herald tried to cover up. When Franklin collapsed, the newspaper viciously attacked victim-witnesses, parents, senators, and anyone else who per­ sisted in seeking an investigation of the child abuse charges. It was company policy to protect the pedophiles, admitted World-Herald reporter Gabriella Stem in 1990. Asked why the World-Herald did not print information Stem herself had discovered about a young homosexual tied to Alan Baer, Stern shouted, in the presence of other reporters in the statehouse corridor, that \"we have to protect the little fag because he would lead to the big fag,\" namely Baer. (When I mentioned Stern's exclamation, on a radio station KKAR program, World­ Herald publisher Woody Howe called me to deny Stern said any such thing. But Stem herself confirmed to me that she had. Soon afterwards, she left the World-Herald to work for the Wall Street Journal.) Harold Andersen volunteered his fund-raising talents also for the Nebraska Wildlife Federation, a private entity established in honor of his close friend, former State Game and Parks Commission head Eugene Mahoney. The latter was to figure many times during the Franklin investigation, including when"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"THE OMAHA BUSINESS COMMUNITY • Alisha Owen testified he was present at Larry King's sex parties. Mahoney worked on the OPO vice squad before he entered politics and became known as the \"godfather\" of many a politi­ cal career. In fact, Gene Mahoney was the godfather of my own political career. I conducted my first successful election campaign, from Vietnam where I was an infantry captain, without ever setting foot in the United States. The publicity about that was important to my election, but there was another, secret powerful factor. Senator Gene Mahoney had become arch enemies with the senator I was running against, Bill Wylie. I chanced to fit perfectly into Mahoney's plans against Wylie. Back in Nebraska, while I was shooting at and being shot at by Viet Cong, Gene Mahoney was working for my election. He was to remind me later, that I never would have been a senator if not for him. Mahoney made politicians, and he destroyed them. Ask for­ mer Omaha Mayor Mike Boyle, the only mayor of Omaha ever recalled from office. Mahoney engineered that recall. He worked behind the scenes, so that no one was ever able to pin the tail on the donkey. Gene Mahoney would demand that you be his \"boy,\" once he put you in office. He might not call on you very often, but when he wanted your vote or your support on something, you had better deliver. I did not deliver, early on, because we disagreed on a major matter. As a result, I am supposed to spend the rest of my life doing \"penance for Uncle Gene.\" It is a common joke among political folk in Nebraska, that if you cross \"Uncle Gene,\" you will have to \"do penance.\" Almost any politician in the state will confirm, that Eugene Mahoney is probably the most powerful politician in Nebraska in recent history. Gary Caradori' s dossier on Mahoney filled up with incident reports of another nature. One of his confidential informants, in an interview on February 22, 1990, recalled how he once returned Mahoney's car to him at a camp where, lacking wife or family, Mahoney spent time. 141"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"142 • THE FRANKLIN COVER·UP Immediately west of the Louisville State Park is a little camp near there with a half a dozen cabins in it. And Mr. Mahoney's is the far west cabin in that group right up against the river. ... We took that car down there and went up with the keys to leave the, to identify the car, so here's the keys. And the door swung open and as I recall there was no screen or anything on it. And there stood a large, heavyset, fleshy, young black man absolutely in the buff with nothing but a big smile on his face. In retrospect, the informant thought, it was likely that the heavyset young man had been Larry King. That would agree with a report by Jerry Lowe from June 18, 1989, of an interview with a former Franklin employee: [Source] indicated that [Godfather's Pizza founder] Willie Thiesen's name had been linked with Larry King's as being homosexually involved ... and that King had also had simi­ lar relationships with Harold Andersen, Eugene Mahoney, and Bob Wadman. Investigator Robert Hansel of Caracorp, Caradori's firm, filled out the picture on October 1, 1990: Information was obtained that Mr. Mahoney has a cabin at the west end of Louisville Park. [The source] also stated that some sexual activities may have occurred there. He stated Harold Andersen was real close with Gene Mahoney and his name had come up on several occasions. The name, Nate Foley*, was mentioned. He stated he knew for a fact that Gene Mahoney had propositioned him in the past and showed him some photos .... [He] informed this writer that Mr. Foley did get very upset at the time when he was propositioned by Mr. Mahoney. He also stated that possibly Mr. Foley did get a promotion to keep his mouth shut about the incident. Mahoney was notorious, as Game and Parks Commissioner, for surrounding himself with good-looking young men. On March 16, 1990, Caradori recorded a description of Mahoney's travels, by a former pilot for the Game and Parks Commission, who used to fly him around:"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"THE OMAHA BUSINESS COMMUNITY • During his time with the Commission, he stated that Eugene Mahoney always travelled with young individuals, i.e. late teens or early 20s .... Whenever Mahoney would travel, especially with his aides, they always had to stay in the same room or cabin with Mahoney. He stated that on numerous occasions Harold Andersen had also travelled with Maho­ ney, which may have been to promote the State Games [sic] and Parks Commission, and also for fundraisers. Said the February 22, 1990 confidential informant, about Mahoney's ongoing activities: This park isn't quite done but it's got a major residence in there with an apartment above and below. Mr. Mahoney to this day, you know he's not affiliated with the Game Commission, lives in the upper half when he's around. The lower half, 10 and behold, has a beautiful blond, blue-eyed young male there that Mr. Mahoney found at about 18 or 19 years of age. And he is kept there at state expense. He's the highest priced park superintendent in the state even though when he came in there he had absolutely no creden­ tials. He'd never worked in a state park and didn't know anything about managing people or the wildlife or anything. On March 16, 1990, Caradori reported the observations of another source: He went on to state that Mr. Mahoney did like to cater to teenage boys and had participated in many outings with various groups of teenage kids, such as the Boy Scouts. With the help of Harold Andersen and Lincoln Journal-Star publisher Joseph Seacrest, over a two-year period, Mahoney raised more than $10 million for the new Mahoney State Park. According to Caradori' s confidential informant, \"There's an assumption that there's some Franklin Credit Union money that went into that place.\" To identify where the park money came from, he said, the place to start quite simply in any state area is to drive through them and record the names off the cabins.

Everything is the 143"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"144 • THE FRANKLIN COVER·UP Harold Andersen this, V.J. Skutt that. And obviously those are the people who probably helped funnel money for that particular project, or something in that park anyway. Mahoney's political power and his role as a darling of the Ak-Sar-Ben crowd were captured in a December 7, 1989 article in the World-Herald: Gov. Orr and Sen. J.J. Exon, who have been at odds politi­ cally for 20 years, were on the same side Wednesday in pushing the election of Eugene Mahoney to the Omaha Public Power District Board. Mahoney, who was appointed Nebraska Game and Parks Commission director when Democrat Exon was governor and who was appointed by Republican Gov. Orr to the OPPD post, said he reluctantly would seek election to the post next year. \"I really hate campaigning,\" said Mahoney, a former state senator from South Omaha. He said he had planned to serve out his term and not seek election, but was talked into running by a group of prominent businessmen who where the hosts of a Wednes­ day reception. Among those paying tribute to Mahoney at the $100-a­ person fund-raiser at the Cloud Room at Kiewit Plaza were Walter Scott, Jr., chairman of Peter Kiewit Sons' Inc., Mike Yanney, president of America First Cos.. Attorney General Robert Spire, and Mayor Morgan. The crowd of more than 210 at the event, which raised more than $40,000, included corporate leaders, South Omaha businessmen, former Mayor Eugene Leahy and former Sen. Dave Karnes, R-Neb. \"I've never seen anything like it in my life,\" said Yanney, a frequent sponsor of political fundraisers. \"The great thing about Gene is he crosses all party lines and he does it with dignity. Gene Mahoney is one of the great men in this community and this state.\" Scott said, \"Gene is a good hunter, a good fisherman, and a good sportsman.

Before coming to Franklin, Larry King had been a management trainee at Omaha National Corporation, one of the institutions that merged into FirsTier in 1984. Every dollar that went into Franklin Credit Union-the miss­ ing $40 million was no exception-went into its account #153­ 7-353 at FirsTier. \"There would sometimes be a million dollars coming in in the morning and a million leaving in the afternoon,\" said one person familiar with the investigation. \"The amounts were astounding, and remember this is a $2.6 million credit union. There is no conceivable way in the world that FirsTier was not fully aware of what was happening, as far as gross irregular­ ities.\" FirsTier would cover for Franklin when the credit union overdrew, as one disgruntled FirsTier official told former Franklin employee Noel Seltzer. Senator Chambers charged in early June of 1989, that the large volumes of Franklin transac­ tions, occurring in such short periods of time, should have raised suspicions about the nature of its business. This was just business as usual, protested the officers of FirsTier. Bank Vice President Donald Petersen told the Lincoln Journal on June 5,1989, \"Franklin Credit Union had acommer­ cial account with FirsTier Bank Omaha that was no different from our standpoint than other commercial accounts. We clear incoming and outgoing items for our customers, but the cus­ tomer is ultimately responsible for each transfer in their ac­ count.\" During Franklin's heyday, the board of FirsTier Bank and FirsTier Financial Services was a who's who of the Omaha business community. On it were pedophile Alan Baer and Knight of Ak-Sar-Ben Walter Scott, Jr., the Kiewit Construc­ tion chairman who was known in the business community as \"one of the real powers\" in FirsTier. 145"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"• • • 146 • THE FRANKLIN COVER-UP Donations to Franklin through the Union Pacific Foundation made the Union Pacific Railroad one of Larry King's biggest corporate backers. Its individual leaders, like former Union Pacific Chairman John Kenefick, deposited funds at Franklin. According to reports out of Omaha's homosexual commu­ nity, the old Harriman family railroad overlaps other areas with King. \"The company is well-known for two things at the top: homosexuality and freemasonry,\" said one knowledgeable person. Is there a tradition or obligation of homosexuality among top Union Pacific executives? The Legislature's Franklin committee heard testimony from a former Franklin employee, implicating two Union Pacific executives in the recruitment of \"young kids for Larry King's friends.\" Robert Andresen, the pedophile whose brutality was so heavy-handed that even the Douglas County jury mentioned (but did not indict) him, worked for Union Pacific. So did the foreman of the grand jury! The Douglas County panel was headed by citizen Michael Flanagan, an employee of Union Pacific Railroad for 27 years. Given that Union Pacific personnel were implicated in the matters under consideration, there would have been a conflict of interest for any UP employee sitting on the grand jury. In the case of Flanagan, there was more to it than that. In the summer of 1990, while the Douglas County grand jury was sitting, I received a call from a person who identified himself as an executive at Union Pacific headquarters in Omaha. He declined to give his name, saying, \"I am too old to start over. I have too much vested in a good salary, position and pension. But I do not feel I can sit idly by.\" He defended Union Pacific as a company that was good to its employees and, he thought, good for the country. But it had been taken over by a homosexual element, which tolerated, condoned and encouraged a code of sexual conduct he felt was abhorrent. Even this would be no one's business, he said, unless"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"THE OMAHA BUSINESS COMMUNITY • it was being imposed on people, using the power of UP in Omaha and Nebraska. At first, I thought the man might be trying to make an issue of some minor homosexual relationship, and I told him I was not interested in \"bashing\" homosexuals. I said that I didn't care what adult men did with their sex lives, so long as they do not abuse and hurt children. I could have told him, but I didn't, that my own brother had died of AIDS in California just the year before. My brother was a homosexual; he was also one of the best human beings on the planet. My caller's carefully chosen words quickly dispelled the notion that he meant insignificant incidents, and led me to ask, \"Are you talking about the head of Union Pacific, Mr. Walsh?\" While the information he provided satisfied me that my concern about Walsh might well be valid, the caller made it clear that this was not the immediate point of his contacting me. What he had to say, was that the foreman of the grand jury had committed impropriety of such a nature and degree, that Union Pacific had to reach a private financial settlement to protect him. \"I believe if you will check out a former very young male Union Pacific employee named Pike*,\" said my caller, \"you will discover that Mr. Flanagan made improper sexual advances upon him, and he complained to Union Pacific officials. A financial settlement was reached by Union Pacific and the young male individual was paid a substantial sum of money by Union Pacific to keep quiet, go about his business, and find other employment. \" I began to investigate, and found the facts accurate. Here is how they were summarized in a lawsuit, filed by me on behalf of Paul Bonacci: The Grand Jury Foreman, Michael Flanagan, should not have been allowed to be Grand Jury Foreman because he himself, Michael Flanagan, had been recently involved in an incident in which he, Flanagan, was accused of pandering and in which he, Flanagan, and his Company, Union Pacific, had reached a civil settlement to suppress such incident and satisfy the demands of the individual making the complaint 147"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"• • • 148 • THE FRANKLIN COVER-UP against him. Thus, the Grand Jury Foreman was being liter­ ally asked to indict other individuals whom Bonacci was identifying for the very things that he, Flanagan, had been accused of and reached civil settlement to avoid like indict­ ment and prosecution. Through Flanagan, the suit also charged, Union Pacific was directing the grand jury: Further, Flanagan himself violated his Grand Jury duties by sharing Grand Jury information with other individuals, including lawyers and others he met with on a regular basis almost every day following Grand Jury proceedings at Union Pacific Headquarters in Omaha, and receiving advice and guidance from them on how to proceed in the Grand Jury proceedings and providing them information on the suppos­ edly secret Grand Jury proceedings themselves. One of King's earliest boosters was the wife of a man with an unrivaled reputation for shrewd investments-Warren E. Buffett, chairman of Berkshire Hathaway. Based in Omaha, Buffett is the second biggest stockholder in the Washington Post and a controlling power in ABC-TV. In 1991, he acquired large blocks of stock in American Express and Wells Fargo Bank. When Salomon Brothers faltered in August 1991, the owner of 13% of its stock-Buffett-stepped in as interim chairman. With $4.4 billion to his name, Buffett is ranked by Fortune magazine as the 24th richest man in the world, and in the United States is among the top five. In Omaha, the Buffett mystique gains from the fact that there are two hundred­ some \"Buffett millionaires,\" who made their fortunes by invest­ ing through Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway. Buffett favors the multiplication of money, but not people. He contributes to groups advocating radical population reduc­ tion. His Warren Buffett Foundation lists hundreds of thousands of dollars in grants to Negative Population Growth, the Associa­ tion for Voluntary Sterilization, Planned Parenthood, the Popu­ lation Council and Population Institute, the Sex Information"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"THE OMAHA BUSINESS COMMUNITY • and Education Council, and Federal American Immigration Reform. Negative Population Growth members, according to the group's literature, \"believe that a drastic reduction in total population size represents the only viable option consistent with human survival.\" NPG wants the United States, and then every country, to enact programs to drop the U.S. and world population to one-half its present levels within 90 to 100 years. Buffett contributes approximately 7% of NPG's total budget. Language about Buffett, and his own, abounds with refer­ ences to his \"cult.\" A 1991 Washington Post write-up of his annual shareholders' meeting quoted guests along those lines: \"It's like worshipping at the altar of the high priest of fi­ nance .... \"; \"He has a very large, cultish following.\" Buffett himself has called his management staff \"magicians.\" Said Steve Forbes of Forbes magazine, talking to National Public Radio about Buffett, \"He's not Moses, but they read what he says as if it were written on tablets. . .. Buffett's economic forecasts are more listened to, than Papal Encyclicals or the State of the Union message.\" In 1974, when stocks were at a low, Buffett told Forbes he felt \"like a sex maniac in a harem,\" wanting to buy. On November 8, 1991, the Wall Street Journal trumpeted in a two-page spread on Buffett as \"the Oracle of Omaha,\" that his \"folksy image belies a killer instinct.\" Backing from Buffett's socialite wife, Susie, came early in the rise of Larry King. Susie Buffett was a volunteer at the credit union in its early days. According to the Lincoln Journal­ Star of March 19, 1989, King \"liked to tell the story of a woman coming to the credit union to see him and being told to return at 7:00 the next morning because he was so busy. The woman was Susie Buffett, wife of billionaire Warren Buf­ fett, and she did come back to offer her help at the credit union.\" For years, it has been part of Larry King lore in Omaha, that the Buffetts hosted a tenth wedding anniversary party for him and Alice. James Traub's December 1991 Gentlemen's Quarterly article served as a platform for Warren Buffett to deny he had a role in that affair, and to insinuate that perhaps the party never happened: \"In 1978, King asked Susan Buffett 149"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"• • • 150 • THE FRANKLIN COVER·UP if she would be willing to host his and Alice's tenth-anniversary party at her house .... Susan said yes, but her husband said no.\" Paula Albert, a close researcher of the Franklin scandal who has interviewed several people who attended the anniversary party, commented that the Buffettffraub account was carefully worded. Buffett avoided an outright assertion that the party didn't take place, but \"you'd be left with the thought that it never happened, if you didn't know anything.\" Buffett told Traub, \"I knew that King was a phony .... It was like he had a big sign on his head that said, 'PHONY, PHONY, PHONY.' \" These protestations prompt the question, why, if Buffett saw so clearly that Larry King was a fraud, he did not alert his friends at FirsTier, or the World-Herald. Buffett is a director emeritus of one of the institutions that merged to become FirsTier, and he served on the World-Herald board. Larry King returned favors, by hosting a fundraiser for Buf­ fett's son Howard, when Howard ran for Douglas County com­ missioner. Warren Buffett may have done some more private socializing with Larry King, if a former Omaha city employee is correct in his report, that when Larry King was crowned \"Queen\" at The Max gay bar, Warren Buffett was his escort. \"This is what his cousin Barbara Webb told me,\" said the source. \"She said the people, they were mad, because Larry brought his son and his wife there.\" The Wall Street Journal feature reported that Warren and Susan Buffett have lived apart for thirteen years, although they attend official functions together. Buffett shares his home with a companion named Astrid Menks, \"alternating his time be­ tween the two women.\" According to the Journal, Buffett met Menks in 1977, when Susie brought her home from the nightclub where Menks was a waitress-the French Cafe. Buffett and King shared an interest in Boys Town, which to many Americans evokes the 1938 movie starring Spencer Tracy as Father Flanagan, the priest with the heart of gold whose orphanage, Father Flanagan's Home for Boys, straightened out"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"THE OMAHA BUSINESS COMMUNITY • many an errant youngster. Known today as Boys Town, it is an incorporated village on the west side of Omaha, with exten­ sive land and plush facilities, and an endowment of $460 mil­ lion. The orphanage is therefore a major power in the Omaha financial world. It has begun a $25 million nationwide expan­ sion program, and will have youth care facilities in seventeen cities by 1992. The chairman of its finance committee is Union Pacific's Michael Walsh. In 1972, Warren Buffett executed a maneuver around Boys Town, which is not fully understood to this day. His own Sun newspaper ran a series of articles, that targeted Boys Town for having too large an endowment. The Sun wrote, \"members of the board of directors of Father Flanagan's Boys' Home gener­ ally seem little concerned that the institution has amassed a net worth of more than $200 million while going to the public twice a year with a plea of poverty.\" Of the cited $200 million, $175 million was the \"liquid endowment.\" Editor and Publisher magazine reported on March 30, 1985, \"The Sun papers in 1973 became the first weeklies to win the Pulitzer Prize for an expose of Boys Town. The story idea originated with Buffett, who also participated in its develop­ ment and wrote a section of it.\" The articles prompted a major shake-up and purge of person­ nel at Boys Town. Buffett is believed to play some significant role with the orphanage today, perhaps in his specialty-invest­ ment advice. An inquiry with Boys Town was referred to the in-house attorney for the orphanage, who, in answer to the simple question, \"What is Mr. Buffett's precise role with Boys Town?\" spent 25 minutes in two phone calls, not quite denying, but also carefully never confirming, that Buffett had a role with the facility. At any rate, Buffett has not complained lately about the size of Boys Town's endowment, although it is much larger now than it was in 1973. Larry King was intimately involved with Boys Town. The institution came up repeatedly during the Legislature's Franklin investigation, and even earlier.

According to an FBI and Nebraska State Patrol interview with the girls' foster mother, Kathleen Sorenson, \"Walters related Nelly's statements to Fa­ ther Val Peter. ... Val Peter then stated that Boys' Town would conduct its own discreet investigation into Nelly's statements.\" Peter apparently did nothing, as Carol Stitt informed the legisla­ ture's Executive Board on December 19, 1988: \"It has been brought to my attention that no such investigation ever took place.\" The FBIINSP brief on Sorenson's interview said: Sorenson stated that an unspecified time in the summer of 1988, Julie Walters spoke to two prominent black males and one black female at Boys' Town confirming Nelly Webb's statements about Larry King. Sorenson could not recall the names of these individuals. The individuals were either em­ ployees or associates of Boys' Town. These individuals told Walters not to ask questions about King \"because it could be dangerous.\" King was highly visible on the Boys Town campus, because of his distinctive yellow Tojan car. On March 27, 1989, Jerry Lowe interviewed Julie Walters by phone: Julie indicated that she subsequentlyhad a conversation with Val Peter regarding the yellow Tojan including discussions that several Boys' Town teachers, including those as having the last names Barksdale, Wilson, and Gary, had been seen driving the automobile.Julie indicated that when she brought the matter of the Tojan up to Father Peter, that he had"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"THE OMAHA BUSINESS COMMUNITY • initially denied any knowledge of the automobile, however, later on indicated that it was his belief that Omaha people couldn't accept black male teachers at Boys' Town and blamed the information regarding the Boys' Town black male teachers driving the Tojan, on racism. At least one reported driver of the Tojan, John Barksdale, was closely associated with Larry King. Barksdale worked at the credit union, as well as at Boys Town, and had been tapped by King to head up a planned nationwide expansion, known as Franklin, U.S.A. In January 1988, Father Peter summoned Kirstin Hallberg. She submitted her notes on the discussion to Franklin investiga­ tor Jerry Lowe: Father Peter called me (Hallberg) and expressed an interest in Loretta's case and said he felt that Boys' Town could offer her \"a safe place to heal.\" When I commented that she probably wouldn't feel too safe if she saw \"the yellow To­ jan,\" he (Peter) said that he heard it had \"been around\" and then quickly changed the subject. Under pressure, Peter once again promised an investigation. Julie Walters recalled, in her March 27, 1989 phone conversa­ tion with Lowe: Julie indicated that she later learned that Val Peter had given an individual by the name of Dave Shanahan, who is the Director of Admissions at Boys' Town, the responsibility of conducting, what Julie described, as a staff practice inves­ tigation of the Tojan automobile and the accompanying refer­ ences to Boys' Town personnel riding in it. Julie indicated that she was uncomfortable about Shanahan investigating this as she expressed the personal opinion that she does not trust Shanahan. Julie indicated that Shanahan was a white male in his early forties and a long time employee of Boys' Town and indicated if she had to describe Shanahan she would describe him as being an individual with a good ole boy mentality who was not interested in the truth as much as making sure that nothing of a negative nature involving Boys' Town came out of the investigation. 153"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"154 • THE FRANKLIN COVER·UP Walters was right-honest investigations of Larry King at Boys Town were quashed, as Franklin investigator Karen Ormiston found out when she interviewed former policeman Alan Kupres, on August 14, 1990. Mr. Kupres indicated that he had worked as a police officer for Boys Town for approximately three years. He stated that he had run the license plates on a vehicle which was regis­ tered to Larry King several times, but that his superiors had directed him to \"leave it alone.\" Alisha Owen, Paul Bonacci, and Nelly and Kimberly Webb all reported that King took boys from Boys Town for his pedophile activities. Omaha author Steve Bowman, who is preparing a book on the Franklin Credit Union for release in 1992, discovered as he interviewed Boys Town grads, that King's activities there were scarcely anomalous. \"You would keep hearing the same thing, over and over again,\" Bowman said of the graduates, many of whom were homosexually involved with Larry King. \"They would invariably say, 'I first discovered my homosexual­ ity during counseling at Boys Town.' \" The homosexual ambiance at the orphanage was featured in a novel, reported on in the August 27, 1989 World-Herald: An Omaha native said his new novel describing a youth's painful upbringing in a boys' home, including many homo­ sexual encounters, is based on his eight years at Boys Town. Jimmy Cheshire, 44, of Yellow Springs, Ohio, said in an interview that \"Home Boy\" accurately depicts life as he saw it at Boys Town from 1955 to 1963 when he graduated as class valedictorian .... Cheshire said homosexuality was \"rampant\" at Boys Town while he was there. \"Everybody I knew was involved in it. After graduation, no one talks about it,\" he said. \"In my opinion, one third of the Boys Town counselors were pedophiles. The only reason they were there was because kids were there. A lot of kids were seduced\" .... Cheshire said he did not find any adults at Boys Town who were \"reliable.\" \"There were some brutal people, some sick people,\" he said. \"The children turned to each other' for support.\""},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"• • • THE OMAHA BUSINESS COMMUNITY • Father Val Peter said of Cheshire's book, \"Boys Town would never condone any activity like that, nor do we have knowledge of it. I think sex sells, like the National Enquirer.\" Boys Town officials deny with equal vehemence, that Larry King was associated with their facility in any way. Evidence from Franklin Credit Union files contradicts them. Working relations between the credit union and the orphan­ age were in order as of a December 13, 1979 letter from Franklin employee Joel Rogers, one of King's homosexual lovers, to Boys Town Deputy Director for Development Wil­ liam E. Ramsey: \"Mr. King, Mr. Larson, and myself are appre­ ciative of your visit yesterday, and look forward to working with you and the Father Flanagan Boys' Home.\" The extent of the planned collaboration is not known, but at one point Franklin was paid $15,000 to do a study on the relocation of people who lost their houses because of an expansion of Boys Town. Boys Town boys could get jobs at Franklin. King hired Brandt Thomas*, a 1984 graduate, to work at the credit union, according to a July 5, 1983 report from Doyle and Carol Gilles­ pie, Boys Town family teachers. They also noted that \"Brandt has moved in with his employer, Mr. King.\" Thomas was still under care of the school, and his change of residence was sanctioned by the highest official at Boys Town, then-Executive Director Father Hupp. His March 26 1983 letter to Brandt's mother, Lila Thomas*, was summarized by legislative Franklin committee researcher Jose J. Soto: \"This letter from Father Hupp advises Brandt's mother of steps to take before Brandt moves in with Larry King.\" Hupp even attended the party King threw for Thomas, after the boy moved in. Two and a half years later, Nelly Webb was to tell Julie Walters, that King frequently took Thomas around with him to serve as a homosexual prostitute. By the time Franklin Credit Union met its fate, Boys Town had deposited, or planned to deposit, one million dollars in the credit union! 155"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"156 • THE FRANKLIN COVER-UP Ifhis liaison to Boys Town were insufficient for his purposes, Larry King had the Omaha Girls Club as a hunting ground. Victim-witnesses consistently said both institutions were tapped by King to find candidates for sexual abuse. In an April 14, 1989 report, Jerry Lowe summarized what he heard from Loretta Smith: Loretta furthermore told Carmean that many of the people who were taking the [pornographic] photographs were lead­ ers of the north Omaha Girls' Club and included prominent people who used code names. When I asked Loretta what the code names were she indicated simple names like Mary, Jane, etc. She had told Carmean that doctors and lawyers were involved and when I pressed her on this she indicated at one of the photographic sessions she saw some files and someone said something to her about one of the men working in chambers. Lowe wrote up, on May 8, 1989, observations from Nelly Webb: Relative to the North Omaha Girls' Club, Cornelia indicated that she had heard that a couple of girls had slept with men who were somehow connected with the Girls' Club .... A week later, he learned from Kathleen Sorenson, that Nelly and Kimberly talked about being at many parties at King's house on River Road and at another location. They were often taken to these parties at a moments notice. They said the parties were for very important people. Caradori's investigation showed that King's control of the Girls Club was a matter of public record, for anybody who bothered to look. Checking the incorporation papers at the Secretary of State's office, Caradori discovered that the Girls Club was incorporated in December 1973, with Larry King as its president, \"to promote ... the health, social, cultural, vocational and character development of girls .... One of the three incorporators was Franklin officer Mary Jane Harvey,"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"• • • • • • THE OMAHA BUSINESS COMMUNITY • indicted with King for embezzlement there, and named by children as one person who transported them for sexual abuse. Had such research been done by law enforcement at the time of the children's complaints, more could have been learned, about the \"very important people\" the girls saw party­ ing with King. The stakes in keeping their identity under wraps were obviously very high. The Omaha corporations that bankrolled Larry King and Franklin are also the major sponsors of youth organizations in Nebraska, such as Boys Club, Girls Club, Boy Scouts, Boys Town, Uta Halee Home for Girls, and others. These corpora­ tions donate millions of dollars per year to these organizations, as the annual reports of the recipients show. Many executives of these firms sit on the boards of the youth care facilities. The donation of so much money and time would seem to indicate a great concern for Nebraska's youth. Key members of the Omaha business community, however, did nothing to help and plenty to wreck the Franklin committee's investigation into the sexual abuse, ritual torture, and murder of children. Is it possible that some of these corporate leaders sit on the youth boards, for the same reason that Larry King founded the North Omaha Girls Club? Why, for instance, did the notorious pedophile Alan Baer join the board of the Boys Club? And after the extraordinary publicity over his pedophilia in 1989 and 1990, and his indictment for pandering, how is it conceiv­ able that in 1991 Baer was still on the board of Boys Club? Assume most corporate board members are not involved in child abuse. But judging by the behavior of the Omaha business community during the Franklin investigation, the ones who are guilty of such behavior enjoy toleration, or even protection, by the others. 157"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"158 • THE FRANKLIN COVER-UP These are the 1987 and 1988 boards of directors of the two FirsTier institutions.

And I responded, that the investigation would go where it went.\" Hard as the Omaha business community worked to distance itself from Larry King, there were even more strenuous efforts to insulate from the scandal anybody of national stature, with whom King had consorted. There was a lot to hide. In the Republican Party, King had a meteoric rise. He sang the Star-Spangled Banner at a National Black Republican Coun­ cil event in 1982, where President and Mrs. Reagan were guests of honor. By 1984, it was the GOP's national convention that heard the national anthem from Larry King. There in Dallas, he hosted his extravagant party at Southfork Ranch, where I saw Maureen Reagan draped over King all evening like a big blanket. In 1988, at the Republican national convention in New Orleans, King sang again. He made a ten-minute \"get-out-the­ vote\" video on behalf of Bush, for the 1988 campaign. The Omaha Star, newspaper of the city's black community, chronicled the rise in politics of Larry King. In his \"Political Viewpoint\" column of November 24, 1983, Ernest E. Bryant"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"THE WASHINGTON CONNECTION • explained why King was unable to stand for re-election as chairman of the Nebraska Frederick Douglass Republican Council. Chairman King has accepted a position in the Reagan/Bush re-election campaign. He was appointed by National Black Republican Council Chairperson LeGree Daniels, who was named Chairperson of the Black Voters for the Campaign, in the Reagan/Bush '84 re-election bid. She has appointed King as coordinator of all the activities to bring out the Black vote. In brief this means that Mr. King will be responsible for meeting with the Party officials and the Black Republican leadership within each of the 17 targeted states. He will coordinate the efforts of these groups in support of the Reagan/Bush campaign .... Mr. King will also be traveling to the 17 targeted states when President Reagan does, to draw state party officials and Black Republican leadership together. Mr. King has also accepted the Chairmanship of the National Black Republican Council, Development Commit­ tee for Fund Raising. Stepping inside the Franklin Credit Union, visitors were greeted by a four foot high picture of Larry King with Ron­ ald Reagan. King's backers in the Omaha business community have plenty of ties to Washington, since Nebraska has been a favorite stomping ground for the national GOP. Although its population is just 1.6 million, the concentration of corporate wealth in the state makes it a priority for fundraising, with the attendant political and business back-and-forth. Peter Kiewit and Sons, for instance, contributed $100,000 to elect Richard Nixon, and later got the contract to build the subway system for the nation's capital. During the 1990 gubernatorial campaign, George Bush called Republican Kay Orr's reelection bid the most important race in the country; Bush visited Nebraska three times. (Orr lost.)

King was 'whisked' out of Omaha 'in a hasty, almost clandestine way' last month so he could not attend an event at which President Bush spoke. Chambers said that a trial of King could prove embarrassing to 'powerful people at the national level.' \" The notes of Franklin investigator Gary Caradori confirm the senator's suspicions. On February 19, 1990, twelve days after King was whisked off, Caradori wrote: I was informed that LK was sent to Missouri for observation because the Secret Service had discovered that he had pur­ chased a ticket to Governor Orr's breakfast with President Bush. LK was approached at a local floral shop, and was rushed to court by the Secret Service, or at their demand. This was so sudden, that LK's attorneys were unaware of what was going on. The word in Omaha was that King, indicted in federal court May 19, 1989 on forty counts of financial wrongdoing, was planning to ask Bush for help. When Larry King traveled the political circuit, he evidently had two agendas. To the public, he was the rising GOP star with the resonant baritone voice. Something else went on be­ hind closed doors. At the Dallas convention in 1984, King threw his splashy party at Southfork Ranch, remembered by me and many other delegates as an unparalleled extravaganza.

Marcy remembered Texas in particular, and a Republican Convention because one of the children, possibly Kendra, had a book of matches from Texas and that is how the children had known where they were at. Joanie stated she remembered that the children had been exploited sexually in Texas, and she indicated that it was [the] feeling this activity had been occurring for several years. I was later to learn from Paul Bonacci, that he was also at the famed Southfork party. He described it for me in exact detail, some seven years after the party took place. He had been there for the purpose of providing sexual favors for people Larry King wanted to accommodate, satisfy, or compromise. Paul said he was one of a troop of teenaged boys and girls, whom King had shipped to Dallas for his purposes. I have talked to Paul repeatedly about this party. I have listened to his description. Only by having been there, could someone describe the setting the way Paul did to me. Because I was there myself for the party, I am certain that Paul Bonacci was there and did not invent his story or his description of the party. This was, it happens, just one of Paul's leads into matters surrounding Larry King and Franklin that I could personally check out and know the boy was telling the truth. Not because somebody told me he was telling the truth. Not because some­ body said he passed a lie detector test on the subject. But because I was there and saw a part of it, and saw the exact same things this boy did. Again in 1988, attendance at Larry King's party was virtually mandatory for any true Nebraska Republican attending the Republican National Convention, held this time in New Orleans. Most of the Nebraska delegation was transported to the party by bus. The theme of the festivities was Mardi Gras. 167"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"• • • 168 • THE FRANKLIN COVER-UP With me was my l2-year-old daughter, Jennifer, who met a black youth named Prince at the party. \"Look, Daddy, that boy's name is 'Prince King.' Isn't that a funny name?\" Jenny said to me, as she looked at the name tag of the son of the man sponsoring the party, Larry King. Everybody had a name tag pinned on, immediately upon enter­ ing the party. I am sure that, again, Larry King had youth at that party, whose sexual favors were used as gifts for this or that politician or businessman. King's parties were designed to bring in everybody, from the innocent to the top-ranking businessmen and politicians. I personally attended the two largest parties he ever threw, as did many Republican officials. As a guest at the party, you would not know from the outer glitter, what sordid activity was going on behind the scenes. I am sure that was the character of many of Larry King's parties, particularly the political events. Outwardly, they had the appearance oflegitimacy, with prominent people in attendance, from mayors to presidents, from businessmen to congressmen. So, when people say to me, \"Well, I was at one of Larry King's parties and I did not see any of this sex or drug or pedophilia stuff,\" I understand that they may be speaking with honesty and accuracy. As to what really went on, I believe they are wrong. Larry King spent his money far and wide, not just in Ne­ braska. One of the places he rented was a house for $5,000 a month, off Embassy Row in Washington, D.C., which formerly housed the Brazilian legation to the Organization of Ameri­ can States. \"When Larry entertained, it was a hot ticket,\" said a public relations man King hired, quoted by Rick Hornung and Michael Casey, in the February 28, 1989 Village Voice. \"Virtually every high-ranking black member of the Reagan Administration had been out to lunch, over for drinks, or at a dinner party.

King acquired contacts in Washington's homosexual prosti­ tution scene, one of whom was the late Craig Spence. A lobbyist and political operative, Spence maintained a call boy ring that catered to the political elite and, unlike most D.C. call boy rings, offered children to its clients. Spence's activities made banner headlines in the Washington Times on June 29, 1989: \"Homosexual prostitution inquiry ensnares VIPs with Reagan, Bush.\" Spence's access was so good, that he could arrange nighttime tours of the White House for his clients. The Times added on August 9, 1989, that Spence \"hinted the tours were arranged by 'top level' persons, including Donald Gregg, national security advisor to Vice President Bush . . . . \" Spence, according to friends, was also carrying out homo­ sexual blackmail operations for the CIA. According to a Washington, D.C. investigative journalist who researched the Spence ring, \"The way we discovered Larry King and this Nebraska-based call boy ring, was by looking through the credit card chits of Spence's ring, where we found King's name.\" Another investigator, with personal knowledge of the call-boy rings operating in Washington, put it this way: \"Larry King and Craig Spence were business partners. Look at two companies, 'Dream Boys' and 'Man to Man', both of which operated under another service, 'Bodies by God.' \" When Craig Spence turned up dead-a suicide, police were quick to say-in a Boston hotel room, in November 1989, it was the latest in the long string of deaths of persons linked to Iran-Contra covert operations and funding. There is evidence that Larry King had Washington business in that area as well. \"In the 6 1 / 2 months since federal authorities closed Franklin, rumors have persisted that money from the credit union somehow found its way to the Nicaraguan contra rebels,\" said a World-Herald article on May 21, 1989. 169"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"• • • 170 • THE FRANKLIN COVER·UP The first World-Herald reporter on the Franklin case, James Allen Flanery, apparently found more than rumors about the money-laundering. In late 1988, Flanery called Carol Stitt to discuss what he had learned. Their conversation is related in a February 21, 1989 report by Jerry Lowe: Carol's notes also have a reference to Larry King running guns and money into Nicaragua .... Carol's notes on Dec. 21, 1988 reflect that she talked with Flanery and in addition to the Nicaraguan info he was also now talking about CIA involvement and provided info that yesterday (Dec. 20) the FBI quit cooperating with him .... Carol's notes next jump to Feb. 6, 1989, where she talked on the phone with Flanery and Flanery told her that the appropriate people didn't want to believe any of this and who was ever going to prosecute it. Apparently Flanery told Carol he was close to resigning and the reasons he didn't think anyone wanted to do anything was because of the possibility of a White House connection, the connections to a number of big people, and the fact that the investigators wanted badly to confine this all to the money. Also many white people made Larry King, he did not happen on his own. Apparently Flanery told Carol he was uncomfortable on the phone, his editor was distressed, and things he had written were continually edited, he wanted to get his by-line off the article printed the 9th among other things .... Flanery also expressed concern to Carol that if he didn't get off this story he worried about being compromised. Soon Flanery was off the Franklin case, which continued for months to be the major news lead in Nebraska, and went to the University of Kansas on sabbatical. When he returned a year later, Flanery no longer wrote about Franklin.

The man on the other end of the phone said he knew I was a close friend of former CIA head Bill Colby, and that I also was Senator Loran Schmit's personal attorney. He quickly came to his point. \"I know there are a lot of rumors, that Franklin was being used as a front for laundering money for the Contras and that a lot of the money that is missing from Franklin actually went to finance the Contras.\" I acknowledged that I had heard such talk, and told him, \"I myself am one of those who wonder, if that is not a real possibility, in light of the way things have been shaking out on the Contra scandal.\" Fenner then gave me a flood of details on the secret Franklin accounts, and where the missing money supposedly went. No destinations linked with Iran-Contra were mentioned. \"I know you recommended that Bill Colby be hired to inves­ tigate this matter,\" Fenner continued, \"and that the committee rejected Colby. That was a big mistake. It is going to take someone of his ability and integrity, contacts and stature, to get to the bottom of this.\" \"So tell me,\" I said, \"just what is at the bottom of it? If it is not laundered money involved in the Iran-Contra scandal, what the blazes is it? And how could Larry King get away with this, without you or somebody else knowing what was going on?

A lot of awfully powerful and prominent personalities involved. But probably not anything you can do anything about. As far as politicians go, it does not seem to go to the very top, as some of the rumors suggested.\" \"Are you telling me that the Franklin theft and scandal was just one big queer party, with a bunch of rich folk who do not want their involvement known?\" I asked. \"Yes,\" replied Fenner, \"and I am not sure we know who all 171"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"• • • 172 • THE FRANKLIN COVER·UP was involved. Larry King did very clearly have contacts at the highest levels, that made it possible for him to prevent proper audits. Otherwise, this could never have happened. But the money was not used for Iran-Contra purposes.\" Reviewing that conversation from the vantage point of nearly three years later, I think that on both counts-where the money went, and the involvement of high-level political figures-I was hearing something short of the real story from Fenner, to put it charitably. Independent investigations confirm that there are ample grounds to question the conclusion of the NCUA-hired firm, FAG, that the nearly $40 million gone from the credit union was all squandered by Larry King on limousines, flowers, gold watches for his lovers, and the like. Former political associates of King, sources on Capitol Hill, and intelligence specialists suggest that Larry King was one of dozens of owners and directors of savings and loans and other financial institutions, used by the CIA to help finance covert operations. From their information, a picture takes shape. S&L managers, allegedly including King, would secretly lend CIA operatives bundles of depositors' money, supposedly on a 30-day basis. In some instances, hundreds of thousands and even millions of these dollars would be flown out of the United States, to destinations such as Switzerland and the Bahamas. The money would be invested for profit in short­ term high-yield financial instruments or other overseas hot­ money schemes. Before federal auditors could notice any money missing, it would be returned. Some of the profit would be used to payoff the cooperating financial officer and other intermediaries. The rest was funneled into slush funds for covert operations. But the CIA would not always return the money. In 1990, a U.S. congressional committee was forced to investigate alle­ gations that the CIA's financial machinations had been a factor in the collapse of several S&Ls. In an explosive series of"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"• • • THE WASHINGTON CONNECTION • articles in the Houston Post, investigative reporter Pete Brewton wrote that during \"an eight month investigation into the role of fraud in the nation's savings and loan crisis, the Post has found evidence suggesting a possible link between the Central Intelligence Agency and organized crime in the failure of at least 22 thrifts, including 16 in Texas.\" One of the S&Ls named by Brewton was the Denver-based Silverado Savings & Loan, on whose board sat Neil Bush, son of the president. Sources have alleged that Silverado and Larry King's Franklin Credit Union had financial dealings with one another, but no independent confirmation has been obtained. U.S. House of Representatives Banking Committee hearings on the Franklin Credit Union, held in 1989, did place Larry King in the right locations for covert operations. They estab­ lished that during the 1980s, King traveled several times to Jamaica, where Lt. Col. Oliver North and other Iran-Contra principals transacted a lot of banking. They heard testimony that Franklin's chief accountant, Tom Harvey, together with his mother Mary Jane Harvey, made several trips to Switzerland, in the time period millions of dollars disappeared from the credit union. In a memo dated June 18, 1989, Jerry Lowe noted that Larry King often received phone calls from Switzerland, that the staff at Franklin Credit Union had heard that King took money to Jamaica, and that Tom Harvey took money abroad, on numer­ ous trips to Spain. Direct ties of Larry King to persons and institutions active in Iran-Contra are a matter of public record. In 1987, according to the World-Herald, King donated $25,350 to Citizens for America, a group that sponsored speaking tours for Oliver North and Contra leaders. CFA was a key public relations group for Iran-Contra; King was a founding member and one of its largest contributors. According to his May 22, 1989 interview with Omaha radio station KKAR, King was trying to bring North to Nebraska. 173"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"174 • THE FRANKLIN COVER-UP A former security guard for King has sworn that he saw North attend at least one of King's parties, a party at which children were also present. Since he was stationed outside, he has no knowledge of what might have happened inside. \"I just thought it seemed kind of curious, the whole set-up,\" he said. The head of CFA, David Carmen, was a partner in Carmen, Carmen and Hugel, the public relations firm hired by Larry King to help set up one of his other projects, the Council for Minority Americans. It is alleged that Carmen, Carmen and Hugel was one of King's direct links to the CIA. Another of the PR firm's partners was Max Hugel, formerly deputy director in charge of covert operations, under the late William Casey at the CIA. Hugel earned the post for services rendered to the 1980 Reagan-Bush campaign. Larry King met Hugel back then, since one of Hugel's responsibilities for the campaign committee was out-reach and liaison work with mi­ nority groups. Brought to the agency by Casey in 1981, Hugel lasted only a few months at the CIA and was forced out under a cloud of scandal. King had a third friend at Carmen, Carmen and Hugel­ Ambassador Gerald Carmen, the father of David. \"What was Larry King doing with Ambassador Carmen?\" reflected a Washington intelligence specialist, \"It was the diplomatic pouches .... Larry had even been lobbying for his appoint­ ment as an overseas ambassador.\" According to a Washington Times report of December 15, 1988, King did seek an ambassa­ dorial apointment. One source specified that he wanted to repre­ sent the United States in Jamaica, where his wife, Alice, was born. During the height of Iran-Contra activities, 1984-86, Ambas­ sador Carmen was in the right place to have served as bag man. He was U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, Swit­ zerland from 1984 through August 1986. The United States am­ bassador to Switzerland in that period was Faith Whittlesey, who was depositioned by the congressional committee investigating Iran-Contra.

According to the intelligence newsletter Unclassified (December 1990-January 1991), \"the Carmen group under a National Endowment for Democracy con­ tract, handled the U.S. activities of the Violeta Chamorro cam­ paign in the Nicaraguan elections.\" If King was involved with CIA money laundering, that jibes with a report from a member of Concerned Parents: \"I heard from two different black people in North Omaha that King used to send limousines down to Offutt Air Base [home of the Strategic Air Command] to pick up CIA personnel for parties.\" The sometimes expansive Larry King used to talk fondly about his friends. In a Sept. 7, 1988, interview with the Metro­ politan King said, \"I know some of the people I admire aren't very popular. Ed Meese. The late Bill Casey of the CIA. And I love former Chief Justice Burger. Those are the people I really like to talk to. Bill Casey .... I just thought so very highly of him.\" Larry King adored Bill Casey, but what about one of Casey's predecessors at Central Intelligence-George Bush? Ever since July 23, 1989, when the lead editorial in the World-Herald said that \"one child ... is said to believe that she saw George Bush at one of King's parties,\" King's connection with Bush has been a frequently asked question about the Franklin case. Anxiety on this account has run especially high in Omaha's black community, where in December 1990, one young lady stood up at a public meeting and proclaimed, \"I think George Bush is involved in this child abuse case, and that is why all these people have been dying.\" Inside investigators of Franklin, and the Webb case before it, know that Bush's name came up at the very beginning, and it came up more than once. The July 1989 World-Herald column, in an attempt to discredit this and other victim-witness testimony, attributed the mention of Bush to a person \"under psychiatric care,\" meaning Loretta Smith. In reality, the report was from Nelly Patterson Webb. 175"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"176 • THE FRANKLIN COVER·UP Nelly first brought up Bush in 1986, when she told Julie Walters about the sex parties she was flown to in Washington and Chicago. She saw Bush at two of these parties, she said, one in each city. Nelly also told Walters that one frequent party-goer with King was a boy named \"Brent,\" the one who was \"flown to another city somewhere\" after a falling out with King. Walters did not have the resources to cross-check this information with the life of Brandt Thomas, the Boys Town resident who had moved in with Larry King. Franklin credit union files contained a letter signed by King, in his capacity as Youth Affairs Com­ mittee advisor for the National Black Republican Council, list­ ing Thomas as one of two national contact people for NBRC campus chapters. Three years later, with an investigation of abuse by King and the Webbs finally under way, Nelly was interviewed again. Speaking to Franklin committee detective Jerry Lowe, she re­ peated her account of the Chicago party, and said that Bush and the two men he arrived with appeared to have left the affair with a young black man she called \"Brandt.\" Of course, as I have made clear, mere attendance by a politician, be he the president or any other office-holder, at a Larry King party does not mean that person knew of or was involved in Larry King's sordid activities. Almost every top Nebraska Republican, including myself, attended the two largest parties King ever hosted, the ones at the Republican national conventions in 1984 and 1988. Bush's name surfaced again in Lowe's May 1989 review of reports by Thomas Vlahoulis from the state attorney gener­ aI's office: Sorenson told Vlahoulis that both Kimberly and Nelly broughtup the name of George Bush and indicated that they had both met him ....

In August 1990, Bush appointed Ronald Roskens of Ne­ braska, to head the Agency for International Development (AID). Roskens had been fired the previous year as chancellor of the University of Nebraska, where Larry King was a member of his \"chancellor's advisory committee.\" Gary Caradori's daily notes for Feb. 19, 1989 record: I was informed that Roskins [sic] was terminated by the state because of sexual activities reported to the Regents and verified by them. Mr. Roskins was reported to have had young men at his residence for sexual encounters. As part of the separation from the state, he had to move out of the state-owned house because of the liability to the state if some of this sexual behavior was \"illegal.\" Upon Roskins vacating the house, he was provided a house by Joe Seacrist [sic] of the Lincoln Journal-Star. The leadership of AID is the kind of sensitive job-AID assignments have been used as a \"cover\" by CIA agents, for instance-for which appointees undergo a background check that would have to tum up what Caradori also heard. Neverthe­ less, George Bush appointed Roskens. When Harold Andersen's reputation sagged in the fall of 1989, due to his unconcealed association with Larry King, his friends at the Nebraska Society ofD.C. staged an awards dinner in Washington to polish his image. George Bush sent a testimo­ nialletter in praise of the adviser to the U.S. State Department and occasional horseshoes-player at the White House. Bush wrote about Andersen and his wife: \"These two outstanding individuals have spent countless hours serving the city of Omaha and the state of Nebraska. Throughout Harold Ande­ rsen's career with the Omaha World-Herald, he has made that 177"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"• • • 178 • THE FRANKLIN COVER·UP fine paper an example of journalistic integrity. In addition, he has been a vigorous promoter of efforts to improve the quality of life in his community.\" Like George Bush, Harold Andersen moves in the upper circles of the U.S. intelligence community. The career of an­ other Nebraskan, Robert Keith Gray, illuminates that milieu and why it would be so congenial to a person like Larry King. Gray is the chairman and CEO of Hill and Knowlton, one of the two biggest public relations firms in the world, with such blue-chip clients as AT&T, IBM, Xerox, and DuPont. CBS-TV's 60 Minutes has called Hill and Knowlton \"by far, the biggest, most influential PR firm in Washington,\" adding that \"critics accuse them of being an unelected shadow gov­ ernment.\" Gray first came to Washington, D.C. during the Eisenhower Administration, as Ike's appointments secretary and then secre­ tary of the cabinet. He went to Hill and Knowlton in 1961. Gray played a role in Ronald Reagan's 1976 presidential campaign and, in 1980, he was deputy director of communica­ tions, reporting directly to Bill Casey. On the strength of his connections in the new administration, he left Hill and Knowlton to set up his own PR firm. Within a year, Gray and Company secured over $9 million in billings from a clientele including Warner Communications, NBC, GTE, Mutual of Omaha, the American Trucking Association, the American Iron and Steel Institute, and the governments of Canada and Turkey. In 1986, Hill and Knowlton bought out Gray and Co.; Gray became chairman and CEO of Hill and Knowlton. Said to be Harold Andersen's \"closest friend in Washington,\" Gray is also reportedly a specialist in homosexual blackmail operations for the CIA. Gray's own sexual proclivities were the subject of an article in the July-August 1982 issue of The Deep Backgrounder, entitled \"Reagan Inaugural Co-Chairman Powerful 'Closet Ho­ mosexual'?\" The Deep Backgrounder tabloid featured exposes"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"THE WASHINGTON CONNECTION • of homosexual networks in Washington, D.C.; its contributing editor was former senior CIA official Victor Marchetti. During the Watergate era, Robert Keith Gray served on the board of Consultants International, founded by CIA agent Edwin Wilson. When Wilson and fellow agent Frank Terpil got caught running guns abroad, Gray tried to deny his connec­ tion with Wilson. \"Yet ten years before,\" according to Peter Maas' book Manhunt, \"in a top secret Navy review of Wilson's intelligence career, Gray described Wilson as a person of 'un­ qualified trust,' with whom he'd been in contact 'professionally two or three times a month' since 1963.\" Author Jim Hougan, in Secret Agenda, reported another aspect of Wilson's work for the CIA: According to fugitive ex-CIA officer Frank Terpil, CIA­ directed sexual blackmailing operations were intensive in Washington at about the time of the Watergate scandal. One of those operations, Terpil claims, was run by his former partner, Ed Wilson. Wilson's base of operations for arrang­ ing trysts for the politically powerful was, Terpil says, Ko­ rean agent Tong Sun Park's George Town Club. In a letter to the author, Terpil explained that \"Historically, one of Wilson's Agency jobs was to subvert members of both houses [of Congress] by any means necessary .... Certain people could be easily coerced by living out their sexual fantasy in the flesh .... A remembrance of these occasions [was] permanently recorded via selected cameras .... The technicians in charge of filming ... [were] TSD [Technical Services Division of the CIA]. The unwitting porno stars advanced in their political careers, some of [whom] may still be in office.\" Gray's associate Wilson was apparently continuing the work of a reported collaborator of Gray from the 1950s-McCarthy committee counsel Roy Cohn, now dead of AIDs. According to the former head of the vice squad for one of America's biggest cities, \"Cohn's job was to run the little boys. Say you had an admiral, a general, a congressman, who did not want to go along with the program. Cohn's job was to set them up, then they would go along. Cohn told me that himself.\" 179"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"180 • THE FRANKLIN COVER·UP The first president of Tong Sun Park's George Town Club, where Wilson's sexual blackmail operations were reportedly run, was Robert Keith Gray. Gray maintained his intelligence connections during the Reagan Administration, according to an affidavit filed with the Southern District of Florida Court on December 12, 1986, by Attorney Daniel Sheehan for the Christie Institute. The affidavit states that when CIA chief Casey, national security adviser Robert McFarlane, and NSC staff member Lt. Col. Oliver North were devising a method to circumvent a congressional ban on arming the Contras, they turned to Gray and Company. Gray employee Rob Owen set up a private group to solicit funds for the Contras. Owen was called before Congress, to testify on how he delivered bags of cash to the Contras. In February 1989, Hill and Knowlton's Charles Perkins rushed to New York, for a fraction of the firm's usual fee, to help with public relations for Covenant House. The youth organization's director, Father Bruce Ritter, was alleged to have molested youth who took refuge with him. Lauded by the Reagan and Bush Administrations as a show­ case for the privatization of social services, Covenant House had expanded into Guatemala as a gateway to South America. According to intelligence community sources, the purpose was procurement of children from South America for exploitation in a pedophile ring. The flagship Guatemalan mission of Covenant House was launched by a former business partner of Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio Somoza, Roberto Alejos Arzu, who had ties to the CIA, according to the Village Voice of Feb. 20, 1990. The Voice quoted Jean-Marie Simon, author of Guatemala: Eternal Spring, Eternal Tyranny: \"It's like having Idi Amin on the board of Amnesty International.\" A top source of money for Covenant House has been Robert Macauley, founder of Americares, a service organization impli­ cated in channeling funds to the Contras.

As in New York, also in Nebraska an institution that sheltered child abuse could count on protection from Washington. The attitude of federal agencies towards Larry King's Franklin Credit Union fits the mold. All the way back in 1984, a Franklin teller named Edward Hobbs tried to blow the whistle about the embezzlement of funds from the credit union. He addressed a memorandum to his employers, and traveled to Lincoln, the state capital, to brief state banking officials on its contents. National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) examiners saw Hobbs' memo­ randum later that year. The memo covered evidence of embez­ zlement, and information Hobbs had, that promotions at Frank­ lin were based on doing homosexual favors for its manager, Larry King. The only visible result of his initiative was that Edward Hobbs lost his job. Between 1985 and 1988, Franklin skipped the annual audit, required by federal law for institutions of its type. The Legisla­ ture's Franklin committee was told that when an audit was called for, King would pick up a special phone, call someone in Washington, and the audit would be called off. 1 got the whiff of a Washington connection, when 1 first inquired about Franklin. As I explained it at a public meeting in December 1990, \"I first noted something a little funny with the credit union when a good friend of mine and sometimes adversary on occasion, named Ernie Chambers, complained that the major financial institutions weren't making loans into the black community, that they were red-lining, in other words making sure the financing couldn't go into the black areas. As I began to investigate, I tried to find out information on ... [Franklin]-what was it doing to get loans there? ... I found out that all the king's horses and all the king's men couldn't get information because, I was told, that was none of my business and if I didn't like it, to talk to the Feds and if you talk to the Feds you could find out nothing.\" 181"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"• • • 182 CHAPTER 14 COVER-UP PHASE III: THE FBI In a deposition taken October 13, 1989, John Stevens Berry, counsel for the Franklin committee, was grilling OPD Chief Wadman about the lack of OPD follow-up on the child abuse when it was first reported. In exasperation, Wadman replied: The tough thing with this, Mr. Berry, is that we have the FBI who conducts an investigation and basically says the same things that we have said. If the FBI, are they now linked to this cover-up in some way? Should the Justice Department be investigated as somehow or another assisting in this \"cover-up?\" Wadman said it, but in this case it's true. The Justice Depart­ ment, acting through the FBI and the U.S. Attorney's Office in Omaha, emerges from the record of the Franklin investiga­ tions not so much as a party to the cover-up, but as its coordina­ tor. Rigging grand juries, harrassment of witnesses, incitement to perjury and tampering with evidence-federal personnel were seen to apply all of those techniques in the Franklin case. In a case full of reported trips across state lines for sexual exploitation purposes, involving prominent persons from the national political parties, where was the Federal Bureau of Investigation? It was running interference, and worse.

O'Hara, who kept Wadman's picture on his desk, threatened, \"You f--- with Bob Wadman, you f--­ with the FBI!\" There was a hint of trouble from the Bureau already in the summer of 1988, as OPD Officer Irl Carmean recollected in a memo to Deputy Chief Charlie Parker, dated December 20, 1988. A fellow officer had just reminded Carmean of a meeting back in July or August, where Lt. [Bill] Goodrich spoke of the Larry King investigation and stated that he (Goodrich) had been in contact with a federal agency that was also investigating King. To the best of Officer Berney's recollection, Lt. Goodrich said that the federal agency was concerned that our child pornography/ abuse investigation might hamper their investigation. Officer Berney told me that although he wasn't sure, it was either directly stated or he (Berney) got the impression that we were to either \"slow down or back off' in our investigation so as not to impede the federal case. In 1988 and 1989, according to testimony to the Legislature's Franklin committee, the FBI claimed to be interested in Franklin money issues, but not child abuse. Dennis Carlson ofthe Foster Care Review Board testified to the Franklin committee, citing state Assistant Attorney General William Howland, that U.S. Attorney Tom Thalken had said \"that the federal authorities were investigating Mr. King .... But he said basically their investigation was confined to the money issues, and they were not specifically investigating allegations of child abuse.\" Howland's part-time investigator, Vlahoulis, told the Frank­ lin committee that it was his impression the FBI had information on private charter flights, something Gary Caradori would con­ firm in a dramatic way. Moreover, as advertised in a May 12, 1990 article in the World-Herald, the FBI had been looking at Franklin since 1987, for over a year before it was closed!

I was told that if Friedrichs* or any of the other people working for the CPA firm that was contracted by the government would say anything, that they would automati­ cally lose their jobs. That evidence was never made available to the Franklin committee, nor its existence publicly acknowledged by the FBI. All warrants concerning the raid were sealed by U.S. Magistrate Richard Kopf. . . . The Douglas County grand jury proclaimed on July 23, 1990, that the allegations and evidence of Franklin-linked child abuse were a \"carefully crafted hoax.\" Its report implied that the perpetrators were Alisha Owen, journalist Michael Casey, and the late Gary Caradori. According to testimony of Alisha Owen and her parents before the Franklin committee, the FBI had this line already in March of 1990, before the grand jury even started sitting.

The whole ordeal was extremely unprofessional. He then looked over his shoulder at the other agent, gave him a smirk, and shook his head. He identified himself as Mickey Mott. ... I then asked them directly whether Troy Boner had tried to speak with them on the previous day. Mr. Mott said, \"I can't confirm or deny that.\" I indicated that I did deserve an answer. Mr. Mott then said, \"Yeah, he came to the office but we can't waste our time with him. He has lost all credibility.\" Troy Boner did attempt to come clean.

Schmit said at least eight people were in his office last week when Boner, in essence, recanted his recantation and said that what he had originally told Caradori was the truth. Six of the eight appeared at a press conference Thursday, including four-Schmit, Sen. Labedz, Caradori associate R.I.

The six at the press conference Thursday said Boner was in Schmit's office both July 16 and July 17, the day of Caradori's funeral. Under pressure, Boner reasserted that what he told Gary Caradori was not true. His new lawyer, Marc Delman, insisted that his client had lied to Caradori. A specialist in child abuse cases when he worked in the Douglas County Attorney's Office, Delman was now better known for defending pornographers. Since Boner was penniless, many people in Omaha wondered if Alan Baer or another patron had given him the money to hire Delman. On Sept. 25, 1990, a federal grand jury returned findings almost identical to those of the Douglas County jury: There is no credible evidence for us to believe that funds or individuals connected with the Franklin Community Federal Credit Union were involved in the sexual exploitation of minors, the interstate transportation of minors, the interstate transportation of minors for sexual purposes or the traffick­ ing in controlled substances.

Alisha Owen was indicted again, on eight counts of perjury. The FBI, as Boner said, had threatened Boner into recanting his videotaped statement, which enabled the Douglas jury to return its \"carefully crafted hoax\" verdict, and set the pattern for the federal grand jury. Federal officials in charge of the latter, in particular Assistant U.S. Attorney Thomas Thalken, attempted to terrorize Alisha Owen into recanting as well. In testimony to the Franklin committee on June 21, 1990, Owen told about her experience with the federal grand jury, in an exchange with committee counsel. BERRY: Now, I do not want to know what questions were asked and what answers you gave. But you told me earlier that your life hasn't been easy and the worst three days of your life were in front of the county grand jury. Was the federal grand jury a more pleasant experience Of- OWEN: Well, now I have to clarify that statement. No longer-the worst three days of my life were not in front of the county grand jury but they were in front of the federal grand jury .... Imagine if you were woken up at 5:00 in the morning, told to take a shower and get dressed. You were not told where you were going. I mean, if sombody came to your home at 5:00, did not tell you where you were going, they had the authority to drag you out of bed.

Over and over and over and over again. I have not heard the word perjury so many times in my entire life than that day .... He was saying this to my attorney, saying I'm going to put her on the stand and if she doesn't, you know, if she doesn't tell the truth I'm going to charge her with perjury. Alisha's attorney Henry Rosenthal confirmed her account: Well, I don't know Tom Thalken .... He came at me like a little grizzly bear .... And he had a finger about two inches from my nose and kept yelling about perjury. And I didn't even know what he was talking about. Over and over about this and that and this and that. I said, let me tell you, if you think you have got any evidence of perjury when she's done, please charge her, just please do that. And that's-every time there was a recess, yelling about perjury .... This was before the evidence even started. Long before Thalken's behavior in dealing with Owen, his name had surfaced in Gary Caradori's investigation, as an alleged pedophile who frequented adult book stores in Council Bluffs, Iowa. Moreover, a confidential informant told Caradori, that Thalken was key to the cover-up in progress. In a February 22, 1990 report, Caradori transcribed an interview with this confidential informant.

He succeeded Pamela Vuchetich, who had conveyed to Alisha the FBI's offer of a deal, from Vuchetich's friend Mickey Mott. In her Franklin committee testimony of June 11, 1990, Owen reported another incident involving Vuchetich and the FBI, which appeared to be an attempt to craft some evidence of the \"carefully crafted hoax\": They had Troy call me in the beginning of March. He called me in the afternoon and I got on the phone. . .. Pam had told me that Troy had recanted his statement about Danny. She never told me he recanted his statement about me. And you know, maybe I was naive, maybe I was just dumb, but I never once thought he could do that because, I mean, I had all this evidence, you know, and I mean, I'm the one that-you know, that told them about Troy and others. It never dawned on me that he would ever do that, recant about Danny. So we-I got on the phone and I-one of the first things I asked him was, why are you doing this to Danny, he's one of your best friends, how could you do this, what are you doing? And he said, something, Alisha, I'm scared. And his voice-the FBI has this tape. His voice is just really scared. And I know Troy sleeps until 4:00 or 5:00 at night, so I started to think oh, my God, he's in Omaha for a week, it's 3:00,2:30 in the afternoon, somebody must be at his house making him do this. And I thought this must be a taped phone conversation. I was-I was literally scared.

So I asked him, why are you doing this? And he-and he said, Alisha, I'm scared, I don't know what to do, tell me what to do. And then he asked me, quote, unquote, do you think we're going to get any money? And I-I stopped for a second and I said, I don't give a damn about any money, you know, just tell the truth. That's what I said, quote, unquote. Excuse my French. But I just-just tell the truth. He said, what should I do? And I said, just tell the truth. And he kept trying to make these leading statements, Alisha, what should I do? And that's when I realized at that point in time that whoever was listening was probably law enforcement, trying to do entrapping statements. . . . And after I got off the phone, I tried to get ahold of Pam. Well, Pam is sitting down in the FBI's office with them making that call. Tried to get hold of Pam, Pam is not around. So I was upset enough and I was worried enough that possibly somebody was sitting there with a gun that I called Gary. And I thought, okay, if anybody is going to be able to do anything or know anything, Gary will know or he'll be able to find out. I called Gary. And Gary said, Alisha, Troy is sitting down at the FBI's office right now. So okay, I knew that the FBI was the one that prompted him to that call .... So Gary told me that it was the FBI. And Gary said to me at that time, Alisha, maybe you should start wondering why your attorney is spending so much time with the FBI. Against Alisha Owen's specific instructions, she reported, Vuchetich turned over to the FBI a file that Alisha maintained on acquaintances from her past. Vuchetich had suggested she assemble this information. In it were the names of some people, like former boyfriends, who could be expected to be bitter toward her. Alisha Owen told the Franklin committee, that the FBI also directly advised her to tell a lie-to say that she had lied on the videotapes. 193"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"• • • 194 • THE FRANKLIN COVER-UP SENA TOR SCHMIT: In other words, they advised you to say that you had lied on the tapes?

SCHMIT: I want to interrupt there because that is almost an identical statement that we heard in the press made by Troy, that not everything on the tapes was true. OWEN: That's what they told me to say .... And there were times when they tried to get me to say that Gary Caradori was withholding evidence from them, there were times when they-they basically really rammed Gary into the ground. Caradori wrote in his daily notes of April 20, 1990: At approximately 1415, this writer received a telephone call from Alisha Owen. She talked about the FBI hinting to her that if she changed her story that they would insure that they would \"go after\" this writer and Mike Casey for \"fabri­ cating\" an investigation. She informed me that she had not fabricated any part of any story and that she was sticking to the story she told me, and that she wished me well. For my own protection, I tape recorded the telephone conversation which lasted approximately 30 minutes. According to an associate of Caradori, Franklin committee counsel John Stevens Berry alerted Caradori that he should get a lawyer, since he would likely be indicted. Alisha was not the only witness the FBI was reported to have harrassed or told to lie.

And then he said he was told by the FBI, we're going to advise you it's best for you that you keep your mouth shut. And I said, say that again, and he repeated it so I could write it down. Gary Caradori interviewed a victim-witness named Terry Muller*. In his daily report of April 20, 1990, Caradori wrote: Further this writer received a telephone call from Sue Tompkins*, sister of Terry Muller. Briefly, Sue told this writer that the FBI and a member of the State Patrol were harrassing her brother and trying to get him to talk about things that he just didn't know about. She stated that her brother is extremely scared. He wants to tell the truth, how­ ever, he felt extremely uncomfortable with the FBI and State Patrol investigators. She stated that a Phillips and FBI Agent Coulter were very harsh with her brother. On May 4, 1990, Caradori added: Following this meeting, this writer placed a telephone call to Sue Tompkins, who is the sister of Terry Muller. She advised me that Terry had retained an attorney to protect him from the FBI. I told her that I wished him well and hoped that everything worked out for him. Caradori's investigative notes for February 19, 1990 record his talk with Joanie Gregory, a Department of Social Services social worker who screened families applying for foster care licenses: Approximately 2.5 years ago she was inspecting the home of Jarrett and Barbara Webb for a renewal of their license. She felt the environment was not right and wrote a letter to DSS in Lincoln. She received no response. After a couple of months, she wrote a letter to the Omaha Police Department regarding this same situation with the Webbs. She was then contacted by the FBI. In the meantime she had tried to do some research on her own, but evidently files were missing. 195"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"196 • THE FRANKLIN COVER-UP To this writer's knowledge, a letter was not written to the FBI.

On his own bitter experience with the Bureau, Caradori commented to the Franklin committee, on June 22, 1990. CARADORI: I think the [Douglas Co.] grand jury is being misfed information. SEN.

You know, the people ... in law enforcement say, we checked every lead you got, every lead that you have and it's nothing.

CARADORI: That's right. The legislative investigator found that the FBI interfered with material even before he got to it. One afternoon in late 1989, Caradori and Karen Ormiston spent several hours at YNR Airlines in Sioux City, Iowa, photocopying flight manifests of Larry King's charter flights. At other airlines, staffers had already confirmed to Caradori, that King took underage boys and girls with him on charter flights. At YNR, children's names were listed for the flights-proof that King was transporting children around the country as the Webb girls, Alisha Owen, Paul Bonacci, and others had charged. The owner of YNR made a phone call, and prevented Cara­ dori from leaving with the records, some of which had yellow FBI tabs attached to them. Since the Franklin committee had only limited, in-state subpoena power, Caradori requested the NCVA to subpoena the records, tum them over to him, and not mention this to the FBI. NCVA general counsel Robert Fenner agreed. Caradori never got the records, but someone else apparently did. Caradori told a friend, that he saw some of the FBI stickers from YNR, in a notebook carried by FBI agent Mickey Mott. The FBI maintained that there was no proof whatsoever that King had transported children; the Douglas County grand jury lamented, that it was a pity charter companies did not keep flight manifests, so no trips could be verified.

It is my sincere hope that the federal agencies cannot just walk all over the state agencies, espe­ cially since we have given them everything we have yet we have been allowed to see nothing that they have. This in itself has not only prolonged the investigation, but it has also been a major factor in that the FBI does seem to get to our leads since they do have a lot of manpower. I do feel that the leads turned over to the FBI have effectively been stonewalled as it pertains to this investigation. The FBI's eagerness to discredit the victim-witnesses may be based on more than just an institutional commitment to protect former Omaha FBI chief Nick O'Hara's friend Chief Wadman, or Assistant U.S. Attorney Thalken, or higher-ups in Washington. A look at life inside the Bureau, including its Omaha branch, shows why. In August 1990, black FBI agent Donald Rochon settled his suit against the FBI for racial discrimination. A highly decor­ ated veteran of the Los Angeles Police Department, Rochon joined the FBI in the early 1980s. According to the settlement, Rochon, who worked in the Omaha FBI office in 1983 and 1984, will receive more than $1 million over his lifetime, and have his $500,000 in legal expenses paid. In his suit, Rochon charged Omaha FBI personnel with sexual perversion. Some of the details are recorded in a \"Motion of the [U.S.] Attorney General for Summary Judgment as to Plaintiffs [Rochon] 'Chicago Claims,' \" filed on September 13, 1989 in Washington, D.C. After his Omaha assignment, Rochon had moved to Chicago, where the harassment con­ tinued. Subhead II of that motion, \"The Sexual Deviance Complaint and Investigation,\" reads in part: In response to his telephonic complaint, a signed sworn statement was taken from Rochon on July 3, 1984. In his"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"COVER-UP PHASE III: THE FBI • statement, Rochon described a series of acts or events which he alleged were evidence of sexual deviance by SA [Special Agent] Dillon and other SAs assigned to the Omaha office. Specifically, Rochon alleged that he had \"personally ob­ served\" Dillon \"French kissing\" SA Agent Terry 1. Bohle, a male, at a going-away party for SA Bohle, and that he likewise had \"personally witnessed\" Dillon \"exposing him­ self in the Omaha office during a regular work day to numer­ ous Omaha employees, both male and female.\" In addition, Rochon said that he had heard reports that Dillon had allowed Bohle to urinate into his mouth and to \"urinate into a beer bottle, [from] which he subsequently drank;\" and that Dillon had been observed \"picking out the deodorant block in [the] men's urinal and placing this block in his mouth.\" Rochon further alleged that Dillon appeared preoccupied with homo­ sexual sex, kept homosexual pornography at his desk, and had frequently spoken in the office of homosexual acts. Another agent backed up Rochon's account of Dillon's allowing Bohle to urinate into his mouth. In an official re­ sponse, Dillon protested that SA Bohle only \"accidentally\" did urinate on him on one occasion. He added that he, Dillon, had not exposed his penis in the office, as Rochon charged, but merely his buttocks. The Bureau defended Dillon's possession of pornographic homosexual literature, as necessary for his investigation of homosexual prostitution. But Rochon's claims of discrimination and harassment were so well substantiated, that the FBI chose to settle. In October 1983, the FBI announced it had investigated a male prostitution ring in Omaha. Apparently one of the agents on the case was none other than SA Dillon. U.S. Attorney Ron Lahners commented privately at the time, \"This thing is so big and involves so many prominent people around this state.\" The investigation was expected to bring high-level indictments, but never did. One Nebraska insider said recently, \"There is no doubt that the pedophile networks investigated in 1983 over­ lapped those of Larry King; in fact King himself was probably looked at at that time.\" Special agent Dillon, who was investigating homosexual prostitution in those years, was \"real close to some priests at 199"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"200 • THE FRANKLIN COVER·UP Boys Town,\" according to a law enforcement source who knew Dillon then. Years later, Caradori received allegations that some priests associated with Boys Town, in particular Father Pat Henry and Father Fiala, were pedophiles; Father Henry was sent to Bolivia when child abuse scandals surfaced at Boys Town in the mid-1980s. Donald Rochon was a successful agent, part of whose respon­ sibility while in Omaha was to find missing children. He once was commended for finding a kidnapped girl within one day of beginning work on the case. Inevitably, as a black agent, he would have developed ties in the black community in north Omaha, where Larry King's pedophilia was notorious. Many of the boys King used as prostitutes were black, and were recruited from Boys Town, where the alleged pervert SA Dillon seemed to have friends. Would it have been just a matter of time until Rochon found himself investigating SA Dillon, and others in Dillon's clique? One thing was established for certain by Rochon's court documents: Dillon was the ringleader of the harassment operation which drove Rochon from Omaha, and most of the rest of the Omaha FBI office covered up for Dillon."},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"CHAPTER IS KATHLEEN SORENSON'S STORY At the time of his death, Gary Caradori was known. to be pursuing two tracks-the Washington, D.C. connection, and satanism.

Caradori told Senator Schmit he had some Franklin leads to follow up, while he was in Chicago for the All-Star Game. One place he planned to visit was a satanic book store. The Douglas County grand jury acknowledged that the alle­ gations in the Franklin case \"necessitated our studying satanic and pedophile activity in eastern Nebraska, particularly in the Omaha metropolitan area.\" The testimony of two victim- witnesses who did not know each other, Loretta Smith and Paul Bonacci, placed King in the middle of such activity.

Satanic activity is not new in Nebraska and the surrounding midwestern states. Some families have passed it from genera­ tion to generation, over fifty or a hundred years. Satanic prac­ tices have spread into the highest levels of society, where Larry King traveled. A Nebraska woman now in her forties, who calls herself \"a little wild\" in her youth, tells how she was approached at age 15 and asked if she were a virgin.

Its sex organs had been re­ moved and the body drained of blood. State Patrol investiga­ tor E.M. Hastreiter said no blood or tracks were found on the scene. Mutilation stories began in May and at first authorities attributed the acts to varmints, mostly coyotes. But then a veterinarian called to examine the dismembering and drain­ ing of a cow near Madison in June said he was concerned \"that a human element was involved.\" In most cases blood has been drained and reproductive organs removed. A helicopter frequently has been seen hov­ ering over the area about the time of the mutilation. A copter with a spotlight was seen over the Lancaster County farm of Richard Benes the night of a confirmed mutilation there. Knox County Sheriff Herbert Thompson, who is investi­ gating seven mutilations, also reports the simultaneous sight­ ing of unidentified helicopters in that area.

In his written history, Bonacci described how King picked him up after school one day in December, \"and took me to the Triangle which is in a wooded area in Sarpy County. I witnessed a sacrifice of a human baby boy. Everyone was chanting and it was a yearly ritual around the time of Christ's birth to pervert the blood of Christ.

A groundbreaking account of satanic activities in Nebraska came from Kathleen Sorenson, the foster mother who took in Nelly and Kimberly Patterson after they fled from the Webbs. Mrs. Sorenson decided to speak out about what she had learned from children in her care. Together with her eldest foster daugher, a survivor of ritualistic abuse, she spoke at public forums around the state, gave radio and television inter­ views, and appeared on Geraldo Rivera's nationally televised special on satanism. This is the report Kathleen Sorenson gave on a Christian TV interview program aired in Nebraska in 1989, based on her experience with over 30 children who spent months or years in her home. We got involved and learned about this subject because we were foster parents and worked with a number of children.

Sex is without a doubt a part of every area of this, all sorts of perverted sex. That is what you will first hear, about the sex, about the incest, and it is so hard to believe. But once we get that, we have learned that we can go on and ask and find out ... and it will involve pornography; that is always part of it. Part of the reason is that they can use that to threaten the children. \"We have pictures, we will show the police if you talk.\" It makes the children feel that they are in great danger, and they are all very frightened of the law. They talk about the garish make­ up that the people in the group wear, they talk about singing that they didn't understand. Obviously that is chanting, and that has come up in every one of these stories, and none of them call it chanting. There will be dancing. Most often that will involve sexual acts. There will always be a leader and they will be very frightened of the leader. These children, from a very young age, and I am talking about children who came out of birth homes, the family they were born to, worshipped the devil. That's all I can share, and I don't pretend to be an expert. All I can tell you is what the children have told me. My husband and I say, we know things we shouldn't know. That's true, and I thought very carefully before I agreed to do the program, because we have heard so much, and it is so ugly, and so frightening, that you hesitate to tell it to people. It's very heavy to know. I don't want people running around looking in their closets and not leading normal lives. You don't want to think you are giving people ideas. I don't want people to say, if a child starts to talk about some of this, \"They probably saw it on that show Kathleen did.\" But we're hearing more and more. And it is becoming very, very out in the open, and I think it's time for people to know that this is not fun and games; this is not something that we can laugh at-or ignore. The children I have talked to have all had to murder before the age of two. That is something beyond anything I could comprehend. But in some way, whether with the help of an adult's hand over theirs, by having them practise, by getting them excited to be part of the adult scene, they do murder. And the evil thing that happens is, that they really believe that they want to. They want to do what the 20S"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"206 • THE FRANKLIN COVER-UP older people are doing, and they are praised for that. And that becomes their goal, to be like the adults. There is a little part in them, that natural good, God-given part, which knows that it is wrong. But in a group, and in the excitement of everything, they want to do that. They enjoy the sex. Children are capable of enjoying the sex. I didn't know that. Well, why would they fight against it? A child will eat a bag of candy if you give it to them. They will take part in these things willingly. When they get out and begin to talk, it is very difficult for them to realize, we didn't realize it at first, that they actually wanted to do it. They are told they will never get out, no one will ever believe them, that there is no freedom, that \"the law will get you,\" they are hopeless before they get someone willing to listen. They are threatened with death. Every time a child is killed in their group, they are told, \"If you tell, this will happen to you.\" They have every reason to believe that. So even when they are into the [foster care] system, and with another family and begin to feel somewhat safe, they still expect these people to show up on the doorstep. They believe that these people know everything they are doing, everyone they're talking to. One teenager told me that she had been told, that if she ever got married, that they would fool her, it would be one of them and she wouldn't know it ahead of time. They set them up to fail in every area. It is very prevalent in the midwest, Iowa, Nebraska, Mis­ souri. Some people have speculated recently that these states are headquarters .... As you listen to us talk about these things, there will be a natural part of you which will deny much of what you hear, and believe me, we did too. I would like to share this with you, partly in the children's words, so that you can hear the things that they said that nobody could make up, that no child could know. That's what eventually convinced me, along with the deep emotion. The grieving, screeching damage and hurt that they cry out with as they talk. The children I will be talking about, these are all children that I personally talked to. They are today between the ages of 5 and 17. When they talked they were between the ages of 5 and 15.

So we are talking about very small children .... We are talking about children forming consciences at that time, learning right from wrong. These children do not know. They come out and do not know what is right. They are confused. What they did before, that they were rewarded for, is such a horror to anybody else, that they are shunned. And most often they have been in multiple placements, they will go to a home, they will steal, they will lie, they will hurt animals. One little guy would sharpen pencils and try to stab people. I don't mean poke, I mean stab. People don't like that in their homes. They don't have any idea what it is, they just think, \"We have a weird kid.\" Many are sent to psychiatric hospitals where they are labeled psychotics, schizophrenics, and who would want them in. I praise God that he brought so many of them into my life. and through our home, and that there are other families like ours, it is just a movement of the Holy Spirit, the only way I can explain it. ... I will begin with the first stories that we heard, which will seem horrible to you, but are very mild to me, because we have progressed and heard far worse things. The first story is about two little boys who were 7 and 9 when they talked, and they told about sexual abuse at one point, and were very grieved. We talked about good and bad touching and we thought we really had gotten to the bottom of it, and then that afternoon the little one began to cry, and when we couldn't get the answer from him, the older brother said, \"He is probably crying because he was in the room, when they killed his friend.\" That was the first one we know about. And as they described that, they talked about that particular victim being brought into a room, hands and arms tied, mouth taped, and how there had been x's marked on his body, on his vital organs. That was bad enough. Within a very few weeks we learned that it was not the adults who had killed that child. It was this oldest boy, who was talking. The next person that we talked to was a little boy, who was very borderline mentally. He had language problems, it was very hard for him to explain himself. And when he began to come out of it, everyone was startled the way he talked. We were real sure, we knew he had not been around these other children and heard anything, but we began to 207"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"208 • THE FRANKLIN COVER-UP question ourselves, \"Are we asking strange questions. Is there something odd about us which makes children come and dump these things on us?\" The part which made me believe this child's story, he talked about different babies being killed, but this particular one being stabbed, he curled up in a fetal position, he was 9 years old when he was telling the story. He curled up in a fetal position, and his eyes got real glazed, and he said, \"They cooked that baby on the grill.\" And I thought, he has really flipped out. I mean, I didn't know. And he said, \"Oh, gross, it smelled like rotten chicken, or rotten deer.\" He then went on to tell us how they would cut out the heart, or cut off the sex organs, and save them in the refrigera­ tor. A very typical thing that these kids talk about. They worship the sex organs .... They kept it for another cere­ mony. I asked him where the bodies went. I did not get any answers from that child about what happened to the bodies, but the other two boys, who I spoke about first, eventually, they talked about throwing the babies in the fire. And I asked about that, \"You mean they were dead when they threw them in the fire?\" And the littlest one said, \"No, no. Them was alive and them threw them.\" And by this time we were really getting freaked out. What were we going to do? How can you help these kids? Where do you find a therapist who can deal with this? ... But God set up a support system. Other families were helping us, and that really helped. The next child I will share about, and I am going sort of by categories here, how we learned, and the types of killings, this little girl is II today, she was 9 when she first talked. It was a very painful thing when she first started to share the sex things. The sex things are so harmful to the children and they are so embarrassed and it is so personal to the children, and they know that they enjoyed that. They know that. We had been through all that. She began to draw pic­ tures of cats, and the cats all had tails that were on the other side of the page, or their leg was someplace else. As we began to work with her and talk, she said that she had had to kill a pregnant cat. She first said that they had killed a pregnant cat. We said how did you know it was pregnant. Well, she could not explain that, but as we got into it, she confessed that she had had to kill the cat. And I asked her."},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"KATHLEEN SORENSON'S STORY • And her description was, \"With a knife, I put it in her bottom, and twisted it.\" Now you tell me, does a kid know that? If I ask a kid how do you kill a cat, do you think they will say that? Those are the kinds of details these children tell us. Later, and they eventually cut the cat open, and that was how they knew the cat was pregnant. And they eat parts of the cat, and the feces and the blood. And again, this was just the beginning. It progressed, and the next time she had to kill a baby, the same way-put the knife in the bottom and twist. The baby was alive and he was screaming. And that child hears that, to this day, and has nightmares and flashbacks. And they cut the baby open, and they ate the baby. They do this, so there are no bodies left, and they bum what is left and grind up the bones. And she talked about that, pouring gasoline on the bodies and burning them in the back yard. And I used to think that was nuts, but I have heard it enough times now that I know it must be so .... We know there are mortuaries involved, to cremate the bodies, and that makes sense .... The most horrible story about fire that I have to tell, and this is extremely, extremely disturbing, it was a little girl, she was a teenager when she was telling me. And she was describing a bam where they used to go to have their meet­ ings and they used to gather outside the bam, and there would be chanting. And then as they went inside the bam they would be split into different groups. And she was never with any of her family, they all went to different places. And I asked her where she had to go and she said \"I was always in the burning room.\" And as she went on to describe the burning room, I thought, how she came out of this, with any sanity at all, I don't know. She was a very small child. They would take in children, probably pre-schoolers, and they would hang them from the rafters in this bam, and there would be as many as five or ten hung in a row. They would be fully clothed, which is unusual, because frequently they are naked. The children, like this girl, were all given candles. And you can picture the ceremony as she described it. And the candles were lit. Then the adults would go forward and would pour liquid from a cup on each of the children's clothing, which was obviously gasoline or kerosene. And 209"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"• • • 210 • THE FRANKLIN COVER-UP then they would give a signal and the others would have to go forward and set the children on fire.

But you couldn't object, because the children that objected were killed. Frequently, she said, people would come in families, not knowing that their child would be sacrificed, and she described the screams when they realized that their child had been killed .... This child, about two years ago, just fell to the ground at Christmas time, everyone thinks that Christmas is such a wonderful time. And she confessed that she hated Christmas, she couldn't wait until everything was put away, because all she could hear was babies crying. Christmas is the time when the most babies die. And she covered her ears and cried for hours, and screamed, \"Stop it, stop it, stop it! Talk to God and make him stop it!\" All she could hear is the screams and the babies crying .... Christmas for the children I have talked to, has been one of the worst times. I have had three children tell me about a very similar ceremony, and I will kind of merge that and tell you how it went. They were taken to a church, and all the children, it is a very festive occasion, and they are taken to the front of the church, and a small child is now brought in, two of them talked about babies and they put them on a platform. The adults are all celebrating and dancing, and singing and the children are getting into the spirit of it, and what they are doing is forming a circle around the child, and of course the child represents the child Jesus, and they begin mocking, and spitting, and calling names, and then they encourage the children to begin doing it, and you can imagine how it gets out of control. And at some point they hand all of the children knives and then they are all hacking, and slashing until the baby is dead, and then they all celebrate because the child Jesus is dead. Kathleen Sorenson was aware that it was dangerous to tell the public what she did. She appealed to friends, \"Pray for me.\" She died in a head-on car crash in October 1989."},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"• • • KATHLEEN SORENSON'S STORY • Fonner FBI abuse specialist Ted Gunderson evaluated the accident in which Kathleen Sorenson was killed as a satanic contract suicide. The other driver didn't die, but well could have; in satanic lore, a person who loses his life in such a contract murder/suicide will be reincarnated with more power, granted by Satan. Kathleen was driving on a long, narrow stretch of road between Fremont, Nebraska and her home in Blair. At least several people knew the road she would be on, and at what time. A car was traveling in front of her, which was possibly the \"spotter\" car used in such a situation. Another car, coming from the opposite direction, crossed the center line and rammed into Kathleen's car, killing her. Both the young woman driver and her husband had prior arrest records for cruelty to animals, a common marker for satanism. Not long after Sorenson's death, a teenager in a youth care facility told a worker, \"You better watch out or we will get you like we got that lady from Blair.\" The youth went on to describe a ceremony of drawing lots for the privilege. One of the most potent weapons of the satanists is the inability of the average person to comprehend such hideous events as described by Kathleen Sorenson. A few years ago, if anyone had recounted something like her testimony to me, I would have recommended that they be hauled off to the loony farm. Today, I have no doubt that much-maybe all-of it is true. I have been confronted with documentation of a world I did not know about or believe existed. I understand why normal people, reading Kathleen Soren­ son's words, will have what psychiatrists call a \"denial syn­ drome.\" Dr. Densen-Gerber addressed this phenomenon, when she testified before the Senate Franklin committee on December 29, 1990: I want to say one thing.

I would also not want the material to be turned over to any other commmittee. Because it takes two to three years for the average person to get through the automatic denial that goes along with this kind of material. The first human defense mechanism against untenable horrific facts is to say that they don't exist. Dr. Densen-Gerber testified that a particular satanic ritual, in which a two-year-old child was placed in the cavity created by a Caesarean section delivery of a baby, was so horrible that she herself refused to understand what some of her patients were telling her. I've been in this field for an awfully long time. I should have realized that's what these three patients were telling me. It was so horrific for me to contemplate. Taking a two­ year-old child and placing it in an open uterus, in a dying woman. To have this child covered with blood. I used denial myself after all these years .... [This] has occurred, accord­ ing to Sorenson, in Nebraska, and now she's dead. And the same thing that is described, this ceremony, was described by Bonacci as occurring in Nebraska. She reviewed her prison interview with Paul Bonacci, con­ ducted the previous day: 1) He has an extraordinary memory for detail, making him an invaluable witness, 2) He does not lie, 3) He has precisely described satanic rituals used by interna­ tional cults which it were impossible for him to have known, unless he participated in them. Oh, he calls one personality a computer chip in his head. He keeps it together by this meticulous obsessive attention to detail.

Now he knew such things, as for instance, let me give you an example. In discussing the C[aesarean]­ section, which was done here in Nebraska, the Triangle. When he was there the girl was fifteen, as he describes her two year old son had to have sex with her prior to her death, prior to the hysterotomy or C-section .... The two year old had sex with his mother. The mother was a believer, he states that she was not tied down, though she was drugged, and a lot of them had drugs. The baby was removed and the blood drained, the chalice passed, the high priest urinated in the chalice, in the blood. Because part of the way of the reverse Christian belief is to take the blood and defile it. But only the high priest may do it. And he knew it. ... The baby was dismembered .... The next thing that he said is that the child would not stop crying and so they eliminated that child as well. And ate the flesh. And the mother died and she was also eaten by the cult. And I said, \"well, what happened to the bones and teeth?\" And he said that they were ground in a machine. Which is one of the ways that they do do it. He described it extremely well. Occasionally you have to ask a question in a matter of fact way. So instead of saying was there anything done with any body part that was unusual, I said \"Who ate the eyes?\" Because part of this ritual is the eating of the eyes. And because the concept is that when you eat the eyes of the fetus or the new born, you gain sight, that's a Celtic Druid ritual which has been taken by these individuals. And without a change in voice or anything else he said Malachi ate the eyes .... And I said but you were supposed to eat the eyes [as the third-ranking member in the cult]. And he said I was out of favor and was not permitted to eat the eyes .... But I have to tell you the detail that he knew about how the rituals are conducted have convinced me he has been at ritual events.

The lives of four fighters who didn't quit, even under frightening conditions, give hope and encouragement for the fight to defeat the pedophile rings.

Then, the Douglas County Grand Jury indictment of Paul Bo­ nacci brought me deeper into the Franklin case, and the suffer­ ing of its victims.

My first act with respect to representing Paul Bonacci was to have him write down everything he could remember, about individuals who had abused him, from his earliest boyhood. An excerpt from what he wrote appears in Chapter 10. In that document and in Paul's letters, his handwriting will vary, depending on which personality is in control. Bonacci was sentenced to five years in prison in 1989, for molesting a young boy for whom he was baby-sitting. Appar­ ently one of Paul's homosexual personalities was in control of him during the incident, in which he briefly put his hand on the outside of the young boy's pants, an activity stopped when a remorse-stricken Paul reasserted control. Despite testimony from family friends and church members, that this was out of character, and despite its being a first offense, the Omaha court \"threw the book\" at Paul. This was before Gary Caradori first interviewed Paul, but the Franklin case had broken, and it would have been known to those to whom it mattered, that Bonacci could be a key Franklin witness. Paul Bonacci is not just a victim. He is an intelligent young man, who has entered a process of redemption. Bonacci was intentionally damaged, spiritually and physically, from a very early age. He was forced to participate in \"headhunting\" expedi­ tions, luring younger boys into servitude. Throughout his childhood, Paul fought desperately to survive hell. He was brutalized continuously. Once when he was very young and it was discovered he was going to tell about the abuse, he had hot metal shoved into his mouth. Now, Paul is in a fight for his life, and for the life of others. A person who, until quite recently, was involved in a life very immoral and dangerous to others, is now motivated to an effort to live by love and a sense of justice. In letters and conversations with friends, Bonacci says that the mission of his life is to prevent other children from suffering what he has. He speaks of being strong in his Christian faith, and of his efforts to convert other inmates. In a letter from prison, to a friend, Bonacci talked about his desire to serve others: \"I'm a 23 year old man who loves God 21S"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"216 • THE FRANKLIN COVER-UP and wants to do the right thing to prevent other children from being abused.

If by my death I can prevent a child from being abused, I'd do it.\" In his written report on his victimization, Paul said, \"I have in the past cowered and given up. I no longer can cower and give up, instead I must stand firm and with truth go forward and fight against the men and the evil they have done to myself and other young people. '[P]erilous times shall come, for men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, with­ out natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, traitors, heady, high­ minded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such tum away.

They can continue to deny these things before men, but the day will come when they will stand before God and He will know all and then they cannot deny .... I have continued to speak the truth and for doing so I am now being put down as a liar. The only liars are those who continue to deny the terrible sins they have done. Also Troy and Danny who at first told the truth and then began to lie to save their own butts from indictments which everyone with a brain could see coming for the victims. I will stand firm in my faith and trusting in the Lord to show the truth in the end.\" Paul has repeatedly been placed in situations of danger while in prison. He has been moved to different facilities, contrary to agreements worked out by me as his attorney. He was given food to which he was allergic, while his weight dropped, and he was denied a blanket for months. He has had no medical help for his Multiple Personality Disorder, induced by what"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"FOUR FIGHTERS WHO DIDN'T QUIT • Dr. Densen-Gerber called the \"emotional Auschwitz\" of rit­ ual abuse. Bonacci was beaten several times in jail. He has been placed in the same area in the jail with potentially violent people associated with Alan Baer and Larry King. Since he testified before the Legislature's Franklin commit­ tee, Paul Bonacci has been under continual attack by the irregu­ lar troops, so to speak, of the Nebraska cover-up, such as the World-Herald and its reporter Bob Dorr, who have ridiculed him as a hoaxer. Paul Bonacci's commitment to saving other children is evi­ dent in his willingness to be interviewed by investigators of child abuse. In order to remember details, Paul must go through the difficult process of allowing his different personalities to come forward and speak. If one personality can't remember, another might. The personalities were originally established, one by one, at the exact moments of psychological terror when Paul as a defenseless child was physically attacked. Some of the personalities are very young children, some are girls, some are boys, some are men. The process of calling them up, of assuming these different identities, often involves intense pain for Paul. If he didn't care, he wouldn't go through these diffi­ cult interviews.

At sentencing, Alisha read a statement, in which she blamed state prosecutor Gerald Moran, the World-Herald, and two of the men she accused of abusing her, Robert Wadman and Harold Andersen, for cloud­ ing the issues and fueling a climate of innuendo against her. \"I couldn't change my story when the FBI asked me to,\" she said, \"because I can look into the mirror and know I am telling the truth. Children ask for justice, while adults plead for mercy. Your honor, I stand before you here today and I ask for justice.\" Even while she was a repeated victim of abuse, Alisha was an excellent student and a youth leader in her church. She is known as an intelligent and well organized person. During her trial, courtroom observers were impressed by her close attention and participation in all aspects of her legal defense. Meanwhile, the prosecution attempted to portray Alisha as an immoral person since childhood, the way a rapist's lawyers often try to depict the rape victim as a slut who invited and possibly de­ served abuse. This courtroom performance reduced Alisha to tears several times. As a teenager, Alisha gave birth to a child, who she strongly maintains was fathered by one of her abusers, Chief Wadman. Her parents have stood by her, and in support of her little daughter.

A friend of hers said, \"Her determination was unchanged by being in sol­ itary.\" When she was 17, Alisha was discarded as a sexual object by the pedophiles. At that point, she was in a position to have become a trusted, and very wealthy, member of organized crime networks. Someone serving as a \"mule,\" or youthful courier for criminal drug runners, would have narcotics worth hundreds of thousands of dollars pass through her hands. When Alisha started to talk to Franklin committee investigators, many deals were offered to her to make her stop. But her disgust and concern over what was happening to other children prevailed. LORAN SCHMIT, FARMER, SENATOR, MAN WITH COURAGE For the two years of its existence, Senator Loran Schmit chaired the Franklin committee of Nebraska's unicameral Leg­ islature. It was disbanded against his recommendation. Schmit has farmed all his life. He is the father of ten children, a grandfather, and has served in the Nebraska Legislature for twenty-three years. His work in the Legislature, on agricultural and water resources development in the state, is described by long-time associates as being of \"legendary proportions.\" Senator Schmit has chaired the Agriculture, Public Works, and Natural Resources committees of the Legislature. He was a member of its Executive Board for eighteen years. In January 1991, when the Franklin committee was decommissioned, the newly elected Legislature stripped Schmit and its other mem­ bers of key positions; Schmit lost his chairmanship of the Natural Resources committee.

In December 1990, meeting with the Ministerial Alliance in Omaha, he said he felt personally responsible for the death of the man he hired to investigate the Franklin Credit Union case. Schmit has a longstanding reputation as a last resort for people trying to help children in trouble. As Franklin committee chairman, Schmit often stayed at his office late into the night, to pursue the investigation of the pedophile ring. After Caradori was killed, and the Franklin committee no longer had a profes­ sional investigator, Schmit remarked, \"Gary had this remark­ able knack of just putting on his casual clothes and going out to places where people had information and just sitting down with them and gaining their trust. That's how he brought in all these facts in the investigation. I know I can't do it like Gary did, but when I hear that someone has information for us I just put on myoid clothes and go wherever I need to go and sit down with them, and try to get that information myself. Gary would have done it much better, but I try.\" This senator, who often starts speeches by saying, \"Well, I'm just a farmer, but here's what I think,\" is a plain-spoken man. The image before him, of setting the pace for the people of his state, and of keeping the faith with his martyred investiga­ tor, has proven Loran Schmit to be a man of courage. He has withstood threats and harassment. At the height of the Franklin committee investigation, a piece of gallows humor around the state house was to ask, \"Who wants to go start Schmit's car to­ night?\" There have been efforts to ruin Schmit financially, including by means of spurious lawsuits filed against him. The FBI launched several investigations of Schmit. He also found his legislative district so radically altered in a June 1991 redistrict­ ing, that his reelection became a long shot.

We have to take action, and stop this abuse once and for all.\" While most of the Legislature cowered, fellow Franklin committee members Senator Dan Lynch and Senator Bernice Labedz, especially, showed courage in standing by Senator Schmit to the day their committee was dissolved. GARY CARADORI, MARTYR Gary Caradori told the victim-witnesses of child abuse whom he interviewed, that he would die for them, if necessary. He died on July 11, 1990, at the age of 41, when his plane crashed in Illinois. His eight-year-old son was also killed. During Alisha Owen's trial, FBI agent Rick Culver testified that Caradori' s work for the Franklin committee was worthless. Former Police Chief Robert Wadman, posing as the wronged party, sued the state for damages, charging that Caradori' s investigation caused him mental anguish. Wadman's claim against the state was turned down, and the lawsuit dismissed. Mary Caradori has commented, that there were no such slanders of her son while he was alive. She calls him \"a gentle, smiling man, a great man and the greatest investigator Nebraska has ever had.\" The man the World-Herald now smears as a Keystone Kop, she notes, was the youngest person ever to qualify as an investigator for the State Patrol. He was univer­ sally liked and respected, and he was \"so bothered by what he was finding in the Franklin investigation that he just couldn't give it up.\" \"He worked on this investigation sometimes 24 or 48 hours without eating or sleeping,\" Caradori's mother recalls. \"He looked so worn out I was worried about him. I told him, 'maybe you should give it up,' but he couldn't give it up.

That is the kind of man he was. And he knew that they were victims of slavery and a Satanic cult. He knew that if the perpetrators aren't brought to justice, they will not stop.\" A former Nebraska state patrolman, who later opened his own private investigative company, Caradori was known as a resourceful investigator. George Zahn, plant manager at the Monfort of Colorado meatpacking plant in Grand Island, Ne­ braska, told the World-Herald that Caradori \" 'did a very good job for us,' providing security and handling some investigations for Monfort for about seven years. 'He works any and all hours,' Zahn said. 'It doesn't make any difference to him. He's a person you can trust.' \" Lincoln private investigator Edward H. Itzen, president of Metropolitan Protection Service, added, \"I've never heard anything but good about him.\" Caradori once traveled to East Germany and found a woman's father, 39 years after they were separated. He rescued young girls who ran away from home and became caught up in prostitution in Las Vegas or California. Franklin committee counsel John Stevens Berry told the World-Herald, that Caradori is \"the kind of guy who can check out the cat houses and find the child and get the kid out of there.\" Looking back, Mary Caradori recalls Gary's anticipation that the Franklin case was about to break wide open. \"You'd better believe there was a cover-up,\" she says. \"My daughter­ in-law and I were never notified about Gary and A.J.' s death.

They and federal authori­ ties moved to tidy up matters that were left hanging. Larry King is in prison, but not for child abuse. Under a plea bargain arrangement finalized with federal prosecutors on June 17, 1991, King is serving a IS-year sentence for embezzle­ ment, conspiracy and making false financial record entries. Since the Douglas County grand jury deferred to the federal authorities, and since there was no trial of King on the federal embezzlement or any other charges, the evidence of child prosti­ tution and abuse perpetrated by King was never presented in any court. Jarrett Webb did not stand trial. In a calculated display of concern, the Douglas County grand jury recommended in May 1990, that Webb be indicted by Washington County prosecutors for \"third degree sexual assault of a minor,\" Nelly Patterson. On December 26, 1990, however, Washington County Judge David Quist dismissed the charges against Webb, ruling that the statute of limitations had run out on acts committed in 1985. In Nebraska, cases of abuse of children under sixteen years of age are supposed to receive an automatic extension of the statute. But although Nelly had reported abuse that began when she was nine years old, the judge ruled that the assaults in question were not prosecutable because they occurred two days after the girl's sixteenth birthday!"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"• • • \"SO THE TRUTH WOULD NEVER COME OUT\" • Alisha Owen was convicted of lying when she said she was sexually used by Robert Wadman. I will allow the articles and statements of others to deal with this, since I have, at Alisha's request, now agreed to represent her free of charge. I do not want to say anything here that would jeopardize Alisha or my ability to help her. But I can say, that Alisha Owen's trial took the strangest turns I have seen any trial take. Suffice it to say, that I believe she had the most extraordinary trial there ever was in Nebraska. I have not a shadow of a doubt that her story is true, like Paul Bonacci's. On August 8, 1991, Alisha Owen was sentenced to three consecutive three to nine year prison terms. As she remarked, she will be in jail longer than Larry King. Minutes after Owen's conviction, Prosecutor Gerald Moran dropped the Douglas County perjury charges against Paul Bo­ nacci. He also obtained a court order that barred me from gaining access to other files that would have been used in Paul's trial. Speaking as Paul's attorney, I charged, \"They dropped the charges so that the truth would never come out.\" For months, motion after motion to deposition those Bonacci accused was denied by Judge Patrick Mullen. Now, Moran stipulated that any such depositions and discovery were perma­ nently ruled out. I had seen it coming. As we moved closer to the commence­ ment of Paul Bonacci's perjury trial, I said many times to all who would listen, \"I guarantee you that Paul Bonacci will never go to trial. They will either kill him, or dismiss the charges. We are ready for trial. When we have the trial, the entire picture of crime, drug dealing, pedophilia and child abuse, and even this satanic cult activity, will come out, with all the personalities associated with it. They dare not bring this boy to trial. Or, if they are going to bring him to trial, they will have to get rid of me first and get someone in there handling the trial whom they control.\" For over a year, after the initial flurry of coverage in 1989, the national news media avoided the Franklin case.

Wadman asserted that \"Caradori led witnesses, fed witnesses,\" while Boner pronounced that \"the whole thing was just a lie,\" and that \"Caradori convinced me to do it.\" The narrator stated, \"Caradori's motives remain unknown.\" The impact on Alisha Owen's trial, of such a presumably authoritative national TV show passing judgment on the Ne­ braska case, was devastating. Although the judge expressly ordered the jurors not to watch the program, a good number of them did, and several reported that it was the main topic of discussion in the jury room the next morning! In articles on July 20 and 21 and a lead editorial of July 26, 1991, the World-Herald attacked victim Owen, Senator Schmit, and myself as \"bacteria that cause a plague,\" and ridiculed the legislature's investigation as a \"Keystone Kop\" affair. The editorial, entitled \"The Lessons of Franklin,\" denounced all and sundry-Senator Loran Schmit, myself, the Legislature, the Omaha news media, Douglas County Sheriff Dick Roth, and the general public-whosoever had ever intimated that the children might be telling the truth-for \"damaging the reputations of innocent people.\" Never again, the editorial in­ toned, should the Legislature exercise its rights to oversee law enforcement in the state."},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"• • • \"SO THE TRUTH WOULD NEVER COME OUT\" • Neither the Franklin case nor the hideous kind of activity it involved, however, are over with. The World-Herald itself demonstrated as much, in a July 20, 1991 article appearing side-by-side with one of its denunciations of the Franklin inves­ tigators. Under the headline \"Male Hustlers Move In When Workers Leave,\" the paper trumpeted that prostitution and child abuse were here to stay. The article quoted Sgt. Ken Bovasso of the OPD: \"Male prostitution has been occurring at 16th and Jackson for years. . . . I don't think you can stop it ... it will continue to happen.\" (This was the same Sgt. Bovasso who supervised Officer Irl Carmean's work with Loretta Smith, which abruptly termi­ nated. He is also the Bovasso charged in the civil suit filed by this writer, with having subjected Paul Bonacci \"to long hours of brutal interrogation involving threats, intimidation, [and] physical and mental abuse ... purposely designed to prevent him [Bonacci] from disclosing any information he had regard­ ing the conduct of prominent Omaha citizens.\") Witnesses interviewed by the World-Herald described the expensive cars driven by the men who pick up young boys, and said that between \"tricks\" the boys shoot up drugs and discard the hypo­ dermic needles on the sidewalk. The Franklin case remains alive not only in Omaha, but in its nationwide and international scope. Karen Ormiston, Caradori's coworker, reviewed the case in September 1990. In her notes on a September 22, 1990 conversation with Alisha Owen's lawyer, Henry Rosenthal, Ormiston recorded: I did indicate to Henry that these kids were only a small part of this case, and that the bulk and real intent of this case was to determine why OPD, FBI. and the NSP had insisted that they had thoroughly investigated these allega­ tions and concluded that there was no merit to these allega­ tions. I also indicated that the end result of this case should be to determine where the monies earned from kiddie porn, child prostitution. and drug activity, were going to.

Again, I stated that the statements of the kids was [sic] very important, but these kids were but a small part of the frightening reality and extent of the \"bigger picture\" of this case. Three days later, Ormiston wrote to Senator Schmit in the same vein: Gary and I have always maintained that these kids were not the case-they were only a small part of it. For instance, where does all the money go that is earned by child prostitu­ tion and kiddie porn, and what is it used for? Why is the FBI and/or others trying so desperately to cover all this up? We both know that if these people were just ordinary citizens that they would certainly be in prison right now based on the incredible amount of information they, the State Grand Jury and Federal Grand Jury, have already received. As a matter of fact, they would have been endicted [sic] based on just a small portion of this information and the allegations made against them. The Franklin investigators had lifted a comer of the rug, under which could be glimpsed a national and international organized crime syndicate, engaged in pedophilia, pornogra­ phy, satanism, drugs, and money-laundering, and protected, as their own limited investigation began to show, by federal au­ thorities. Pull a thread on any comer of this vast, seamless web, and the whole begins to unravel. In the Franklin case, this is nowhere clearer than in the testimony of Paul Bonacci. I debriefed Paul Bonacci at length, as did private investigator Roy Stephens, in preparation for the perjury trial that was not to be. Through his many personalities, each with its own distinct, partial recollections, Bonacci provided new evidence on child kidnaping, pornography, and murder taking place in the United States and abroad. The Franklin case was just one part of what"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"• • • \"SO THE TRUTH WOULD NEVER COME OUT\" • he knew. The North American Man-Boy Love Association, or NAMBLA, figured prominently in what else Bonacci could recall. The motto of NAMBLA is \"Sex before eight, or it's too late.\" One of its leaders is named David Thorstadt. Two of Bonacci's personalities, Sean and Christopher, have \"Thors­ tadt\" as their last name. Bonacci reports that he was brought into contact with Thorstadt through two Omaha men, that he traveled with Thorstadt to New York, and that he witnessed NAMBLA-organized auctions of children. Alexandrew, another Bonacci personality, wrote to Dr. Densen-Gerber, who had examined him in prison, in April 1991: I can even recall when and where I remember you from. Tell me if I'm wrong in which I know you wouldn't remem­ ber me. It was in New York on December I believe the 28th or 29th, 1982, it was a Tuesday or Wednesday (not important). It was a news conference at I believe the Holiday Inn. I had to wait for David [Thorstadt] with a friend. When he got done he told me that wicked old witch Gerber was someone he had to fix somehow. Densen-Gerber, dubbed \"public enemy #1\" by NAMBLA for her efforts to expose the organization, commented, \"He's absolutely right. The details are perfect. ... \" Bonacci may remember events in Europe. He tells of having traveled to Europe more than once. One of his personalities speaks and writes German, more fluently than is probable just from Paul's brief study of German in high school. In July 1991, just as the Franklin case got officially wrapped up at the sentencing of Alisha Owen, the news broke in Iowa that Paul Bonacci had given evidence in one of the most notori­ ous kidnaping cases in the country. It was the disappearance of Johnny Gosch. Early Sunday morning, September 5, 1982, 12-year-old Johnny Gosch went out on his Des Moines Register paper 229"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"230 • THE FRANKLIN COVER·UP delivery route, as usual. Only that Sunday, he never came home. For nine years, his parents have searched the country for him. Most evenings, and weekends when they were not on the road to check out leads, they sold candy bars in local shopping centers, to finance the search. In late 1990, the Gosches got the first major break in years, because of what Paul Bonacci had to tell. I had noted that one of the events Paul described reminded me of the case of Johnny Gosch, which I had read about years earlier. I went to the library, and confirmed the similarity of the details of the case, with what Paul said. I then contacted the Gosch family. They advised me that they had had their fill of false leads from people who claimed to know something about their missing boy, and people who claimed to have infor­ mation for sale but did not seem genuinely interested. But a couple of weeks later, Mr. Gosch did come to Omaha. The Des Moines Register of July 24, 1991 reported on what developed: A Nebraska inmate has provided details about the abduction of Johnny Gosch that only someone with firsthand knowl­ edge could have had, his lawyer said Tuesday. Inmate Paul Bonacci's account \"did not match up 90 percent, not 95 percent, not 98 percent, but 100 percent,\" John DeCamp said. \"I am convinced this kid is telling absolutely the truth. . . . He never varied on the time. He gave a description of Johnny's pants, names on his shirt, scars on the body.\" DeCamp said he became suspicious of a Gosch connec­ tion when he read a transcript of a psychiatrist's interview with Bonacci in which an \"incident\" involving a newspaper carrier was mentioned. DeCamp said Bonacci didn't identify Gosch by his full name. \"I went to the library and checked on Johnny Gosch. I wrote to the Gosches and told them I don't know if there is any validity, but the dates coincide and he talks about someone from Iowa.\" DeCamp said John Gosch, the boy's father, met with Bonacci, \"and started getting chills. I believe he believed him,\" DeCamp said."},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"\"SO THE TRUTH WOULD NEVER COME OUT\" • John Gosch, Sr. walked into the prison in Lincoln, Nebraska to meet Paul Bonacci for the first time, unannounced. Sitting down across from him, Gosch asked Bonacci, \"Do you know who I am?\" Bonacci replied, \"You look like-it can't be-the eyes, you look like Johnny Gosch.\" Noreen Gosch told the World-Herald. that paper reported on July 22, 1991, that Bonacci knew \"some incredible things\" about the case. For instance, \"There were photographs taken of Johnny prior to the kidnaping. We know this because a woman reported it to police. We're convinced Bonacci saw those pictures. He accurately described the location, which is not far from our home. He described many things about the pictures which we have never publicly talked about.\" Bonacci also described a mark on Johnny Gosch's body, which the Gosches had never publicized. As a result of the Gosch meeting, Roy Stephens came to visit with me. Shortly after we discussed Paul Bonacci and the Gosch case, I hired him to check out Bonacci's story on Gosch and on other things. Roy Stephens is an Omaha-based investigator and a founder of the Missing Children's Foundation. A former safecracker who went straight, Stephens was named \"Outstanding Man of the Year\" for 1991, by the Nebraska Jaycees, for his work in recover­ ing children. Roy is remembered in Nebraska, as the man who did what the police and other investigators were unable to do­ locate and cause the conviction of the kidnaper of Jill Cutshall, the Norfolk, Nebraska girl who disappeared in 1987 and almost certainly was murdered, though her body was never found. Stephens was cited as the leading child finder in the nation, in an article in the 1991 summer supplement to Forbes maga­ zine: \"The best in the business in that field, according to a survey of his peers, is Roy Stephens ... who has recovered some 50 missing children over the last five-and-a-half years,\" said G. Gordon Liddy of Watergate fame, now a private security consultant in Florida.

Quoted in the July 22, 1991 World­ Herald, Stephens said that Bonacci \"hasn't told me anything that hasn't been true.\" Bonacci described to Stephens the kidnaping of Johnny Gosch, as an eyewitness: PB: Well, we got up at, oh, before the sun got up.

Because I had said something and Emilio hit me a couple of times. RS: What did you say? PB: Called him a dirty bastard because of the way he treated Mike .... At night when we was in the hotel and stuff he'd brought some other guy and made Mike have sex with that guy. I didn't think that was right. ...

And it sounded like there was more than one kid. It sounded like there was a couple of them there. And then we went around the block and he let me out of the trunk and told Mike to, he says, if you don't do what I say, I'm gonna shoot you. He has a gun he pulled out and pointed at me and says, you do what I say or I'll shoot you.

RS: You're both sitting there? Were you hidden in the back seat or were you just sitting up normal? PB: Down low, kind of sitting on the floor. And then Emilio, I guess, I don't know what he did, but he, Mike told me, he says, when the car slows down, he says, when you feel the brakes jerk, he says, I'll grab him and you just hold him down. And so it happened quick. It's like we went up, I felt the brakes jerk, and I saw the door fly open and I saw Mike jump out and the next thing I know there was somebody, you know, he grabbed the boy and he'd thrown him in and my job, you know we were supposed to do is just hold him down and gag his mouth so he couldn't yell or nothing. And then after we had, just, like two seconds, just spun off, tore off, got out of there. Two other people were involved in the kidnaping, one of whom was a local contact. Bonacci named them all. According to a July 18 article in the Des Moines Register, \"Stephens has told the family, sources say, that [Bonacci] identified the Des Moines 'contact' from a photograph. The suspected contact, said [Noreen] Gosch, has been under suspicion by the family for some time.\" Furthermore, \"Gosch said Stephens told her the same ring may be involved in other kidnapings in the region, including the suspected abuction of Des Moines Register carrier Eugene Martin, 13, in south Des Moines in 1984, and more recently, that of Jacob Wetterling in St. Joseph, Minn.\" Bonacci described a network of safehouses, where the pedo­ phile ring stored kidnaped children before selling them. He said he met Johnny Gosch again several years later, and provided a detailed description of the farm on which Gosch was being kept in Colorado and of Gosch's new \"parents,\" a homosexual man and a lesbian in their thirties. After Gosch once attempted to run away, Bonacci reported, they branded him on the buttocks with the same brand used on horses and cows on the farm, of which Bonacci drew a picture for Roy Stephens. The man called Emilio was part of a highly organized na­ 233"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"• • • 234 • THE FRANKLIN COVER-UP tional and international kidnaping ring. Stephens asked Bo­ nacci, \"What did Emilio tell you that he did for a living?\" PB: Kidnap kids and took them to Las Vegas. RS: What kind of kids? PB: Any kid that he could get. RS: Does it matter if it's male or female? PB: Him, no, him he'd kidnap boys or girls. Main thing he'd kidnap was boys, though, 'cause he said he'd get more money for them. Emilio used to tell me all kinds of things like how they could get away with kidnaping kids and sell them out of the country. He said most of the kids were sold in Las Vegas at a ranch he took me to one time for an auction. I went with him to Toronto several times where boys were sold. I saw a few girls once in a while. He said virgins could bring as much as $50,000. They called the boys toys, used toys brought in money but not as much .... Most boys were sold out of America cause it's harder to find them. The men who bought them had planes and could transport them easily. Bonacci ran into Emilio again in March 1986, near Buena Vista, Colorado, on the second occasion he saw Johnny Gosch. Despite the astonishing new information from Paul Bonacci on the Gosch kidnaping, West Des Moines police \"have not interviewed Bonacci and have no plans to do so,\" according to the July 21, 1991 Des Moines Sunday Register. \"We are aware of what's going on,\" said Lt. Gerry Scott, in charge of the Gosch investigation. \"We're not going to reinvent the wheel. This has been investigated in Nebraska. When things need investigating, here, they will be investigated.\" Bonacci also conveyed to Stephens specific recollections related to two other notorious cases-pedophilia and ritualistic abuse in Jordan, Minnesota, and satanism and child sacrifice near Bakersfield, California. In 1983 and 1984, Scott County, Minnesota prosecutor"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"\"SO THE TRUTH WOULD NEVER COME OUT\" • Kathleen Morris investigated and began to prosecute a ring of child molesters centered in the town of Jordan. Child victims had testified about satanic rituals and the filming of children in sex acts. \"The case involves the largest adult-juvenile sex ring in Minnesota history, authorities said,\" reported the Minne­ apolis Star-Tribune on November 18, 1983. At least 30 children told police they had been molested. Morris brought indictments against 24 adults. People magazine of October 22, 1984 summarized, \"The village harbored rings of adult sex abusers who incestuously victimized their own children and other children during ritualistic sex parties involv­ ing sadism and bestiality. Some of the children described a bizarre sexual variation of hide-and-seek in which children who were 'found' were taken to a bedroom and abused.\" The children told of witnessing three ritualistic murders. Child care workers and psychologists found the children highly credible. Psychologist Michael Shea, who treated some of them, told People, \"Children are not able to fantasize in such graphic detail about sexual acts which are outside their experience. And they certainly can't be coerced, or bribed or brainwashed into making statements about their parents.\" Minnesota psychologist Susan Phipps- Yonas, who also inter­ viewed some of the children, told the Star-Tribune that she fully believed their reports: \"It's not just the details that make them convincing, but the [emotional] effect behind the stories. They're extraordinarily upset when they recount these things. They'd have to be world-class actors to be so convincing if it wasn't true.\" Phipps-Yonas speculated that since the children talked about large sums of money changing hands, organized crime was likely involved. Morris indicted the ring's chief figure, 26-year-old James Rud, on 108 counts of child abuse. His parents, Alvin and Rosemary Rud, and his 17-year old brother were also indicted, as were several other people from the Valley Green Trailer Park, 35 miles outside of Minneapolis-St. Paul. Most of the abused children also lived in the trailer park.

Yet in 1991, from prison in Nebraska, Paul Bonacci identi­ fied by name, from pictures, some of the same individuals Morris had been investigating.

Although the boy was confused over the meaning of the sexual terms, when a defense attorney asked if he feared that his father would abuse him again, the boy looked across the courtroom at Bentz and replied, \"You won't do that no more, right?\" During the grueling cross-examination, defense attorneys succeeded in shaking some of the young witnesses' stories by hammering away at dates, places and word meanings. However, a 12-year-old girl steadfastly refused to waver from her testimony. When a defense attorney accused her of lying, she snapped: \"You're just helping Bob and Lois [Bentz] to get out of this stuff, this child-abusing stuff, I'm not lying, you guys are. It's the truth, they hurt us.\" Later she rushed tearfully into the arms of a social worker. Though the Bentzes got off in the Scott County case, James Rud plea-bargained. Before the case was scratched, he pleaded guilty to lesser charges. In 1978 and 1980, Rud had been convicted of sexually abusing children in Virginia and Minne­ sota, respectively. On other occasions, Bonacci described ritualistic abuse and the sacrifice of a boy at a place near Bakersfield, California. The details of his testimony, including names, are consistent with the 1983-1985 investigation by Kern County, California Sheriff Larry Kleier into satanic ritual abuse there. Despite attempts by the state attorney general, John Van De Kamp, to discredit the Kern County investigation as based on \"hearsay\" and \"hysteria,\" a grand jury indicted seven people on 377 counts of pornography, child abuse and drug possession. They were convicted in a 1986 trial and sentenced to a total of 2,600 years in prison, but a state appeals court overturned the convictions in 1990, on grounds of \"egregious prosecutorial misconduct.\" Several months after becoming Paul Bonacci's attorney in the summer of 1990, I remarked to a friend, \"You know, the"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"\"SO THE TRUTH WOULD NEVER COME OUT\" • more I find out about this case, the more I am absolutely convinced that drugs are a major part of it. Everywhere you turn, there are drugs, and on a huge scale. The kids report Alan Baer involved in bigtime drugs from California, Larry King has been reported as a major pusher, and Wadman's name has been strongly linked to drugs.\" Through the use of young boys and girls, Larry King was able to have a nationwide drug transportation network. It interfaced perfectly with his ability to compromise and blackmail politi­ cians or businessmen. Having cocaine available could make it easier for Larry King to entice prominent people, after they got drunk, and then high on the drug, into sex with a teenaged girl or boy. According to the accounts of Paul Bonacci and Alisha Owen, Alan Baer was running a nationwide drug ring, and used chil­ dren 18 or under as couriers. Once the children became 19, and thus could be tried as adults, Baer let them go. Senator Ernie Chambers observed to the Executive Board of the Legislature on December 19, 1988, just as the Franklin investigation was getting underway: My community is ravaged by drugs. We see the Omaha police picking up kids from 14 to l8-years old with a half an ounce or less of these narcotic substances and that is supposed to be fighting the drugs. These are nickel and dime pushers, not suppliers, not mid level suppliers. A few days ago the Douglas County Sheriff got together with some of the county sheriffs, one was from Sarpy, and they made a raid and they got a pound and a half of heavy drugs, some money and some weapons. They didn't tell the Omaha po­ lice. And I talked to the Douglas County Attorney and I told him I was glad they didn't tell them because had the Omaha police been notified this drug bust would never have occurred, they would have told the individual, they would not have gotten a substantial amount of the drugs. These nickel and dime people in my community that they are arresting don't have the connections or the money to bring 239"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"• • • 240 • THE FRANKLIN COVER-UP the amount of drugs into the City of Omaha that are coming. And certainly the little piddling amounts that are picked up by the police have no meaning or significance. When we wanted, as a community, to help organize and work with a task force of black officers to address the drug problem and the gang problem, Chief Wadman fought it tooth and nail and did not want it, wanted to deny that the problem existed. And I said the only reason that a police official would be opposedto this kind of action is because he knows something or he's part of it. One of Caradori' s informants stated that Wadman was instru­ mental in bringing the drug-trafficking gangs, the Los Angeles­ based Bloods and Cryps, into Omaha. According to a June 19, 1989 report by Caradori's predecessor at the Franklin commit­ tee, Jerry Lowe, members ofthe Bloods and Cryps were identi­ fied by local police as driving Larry King's car. As soon as awareness dawned, that sexual and ritual abuse of children was happening in Nebraska, and that it was being protected from within the political and law enforcement estab­ lishment, a resistance movement on behalf of the children took shape. In her famous interview on Geraldo Rivera's TV special on satanism, Kathleen Sorenson identified her group as Believe the Children. Later, friends of Kathleen were active in the Concerned Parents group, which urged that the testimony of Loretta Smith and others be investigated on its merits, instead of dismissed out of hand. Against the shroud of cover-up, imposed by the World­ Herald in its treatment of the Franklin case, some newspapers showed the integrity to keep all aspects of the case alive in Nebraska. Foremost among these has been the Nebraska Ob­ server, published by the Nebraska Citizens' Publishing Group and edited by Frances Mendenhall. While most of the national press dropped the Franklin story,"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"\"SO THE TRUTH WOULD NEVER COME OUT\" • in the summer of 1990, Executive Intelligence Review sent an investigative team into the state to report on the case first-hand. Its July 27, 1990 article, \"FBI covers up child abuse, murder in Nebraska,\" brought a rain of denunciations on the pages of the World-Herald, which made much of the fact that EIR was founded by the jailed economist and presidential candidate, Lyndon LaRouche. After an initial \"no comment\" from an FBI spokesman, Nick O'Hara's successor at the Nebraska-Iowa office of the bureau, Charles Lontor, took to the pages of the World-Herald on August 13, to denounce such talk of cover­ up as \"nonsense,\" and to say that the FBI did \"not wish to become involved in a futile public debate with them [EIR] or anyone who may choose to support their efforts.\" It was my view, that the Franklin cover-up was so massive in Nebraska, that it could not be broken just inside the state. In 1991, the case did receive attention in the Italian weekly A vvenimenti and in Pronto, published in Spain. Both articles came from Italian journalists Giovanni Caporaso and Massimi­ liano Cocozza Lubisco, a team that has produced many stories for Italian television. After their own May 1991 investigative trip to Nebraska, they wrote about the kidnaping and sale of children as \"the market of horrors.\" They quoted Paul Bonacci and Roy Stephens at length. I was glad of the presence of other international observers, who came when the Schiller Institute, founded by Helga Zepp­ LaRouche in 1984 and based in Washington, D.C. and Laatzen, Germany, organized an ad hoc human rights fact-finding mis­ sion to Nebraska. In response to a Schiller Institute appeal, nine people from five U.S. states and three foreign countries constituted themselves as the Citizens' Fact-Finding Commis­ sion to Investigate Human Rights Violations in Nebraska. Among them were the Reverend James Bevel, former close associate of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., an Austrian leader of the European Citizens' Initiative to Protect Life and Human Dignity, the president of the Ukrainian Political Action Com­ mittee of the United States, and a clinical psychologist from Canada. They came from October 11 to 17, 1990, and during 241"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"242 • THE FRANKLIN COVER·UP that week, interviewed many witnesses, visited the Omaha FBI office, watched hours of videotaped testimony from child victims, and read mountains of documents. The Citizens' Fact-Finding Commission issued a report that denounced the \"torture and murder-in-progress\" of Paul Bo­ nacci, and said that there was so little recourse through the law left in Nebraska, that an international spotlight needed to be shined on the systematic \"violations of human rights\" there. After these findings were published, one hundred fifty cler­ gymen, civil rights leaders and other community leaders from throughout the United States signed a \"Letter to the Citizens of Nebraska,\" which endorsed the findings and called on the Senate Franklin committee to pursue its investigation \"at all costs.\" The World-Herald refused to print the Commission's findings and the endorsement letter, even as a paid advertise­ ment. In an October 20, 1990 article by Bob Dorr, the paper attacked the independent fact-finders as \"LaRouche Investi­ gators.\" There and in subsequent articles, Dorr called upon the exper­ tise of so-called \"anti-cult\" specialists from the Anti-Defama­ tion League (ADL) of B'nai B'rith and the Cult Awareness Network (CAN), in attempts to rebut the Commission's work. Rev. Bevel came in for particularly strong attack by such de­ fenders of the cover-up. Rev. Bevel was so horrified by what he witnessed during the short mission of the Fact-Finding Commission, that he moved to Nebraska for a period of months, to work with citizens resisting pedophilia and the cover-up of it. He was the target of death threats and physical attack in Omaha. At first I thought that Rev. Bevel must be crazy, or a radical trouble-maker. Why would a middle-aged man with a family to support take off and move to Nebraska in the middle of winter, to take up a cause that could guarantee him nothing but grief, and might get him killed? But as I watched him work and saw his dedication, I learned more about faith, hope, charity and truth from this one dedicated individual, than from all the priests, pastors and rabbis I have"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"\"SO THE TRUTH WOULD NEVER COME OUT\" • known. Rev. Bevel cared about one thing-children. Children were being abused and were going to be abused, unless some­ thing was done. The more Bevel worked, the more he was condemned by the World-Herald for his efforts in the black community, particularly, to expose the sins. Rev. Bevel and others found there was a tremendous unspo­ ken support among the people of Nebraska, for the victims of the child abuse ring. Radio call-in polls showed that Nebras­ kans, by margins of up to ten to one, do not agree with the way prosecutors have handled the Franklin case or believe that the witnesses are hoaxers. During 1991, a newly-formed citizens' group called the Nebraska Leadership Conference mobilized a large number of people, hundreds of whom traveled to Lincoln for several large conferences. At two of the conferences, detailed background presentations on the exploitation of children and on the Franklin cover-up were made by knowledgeable people from many dif­ ferent institutions and organizations in Nebraska. At a third, out­ of-state specialists on satanic cults were given the opportunity to educate Nebraskans on the scope of the problem. The confer­ ences turned into mass meetings, which rallied support for the victim-witnesses. In September 1991, the Nebraska Leadership Conference issued a pamphlet called \"The Mystery of the Carefully Crafted Hoax,\" which documented many of the inconsistencies in the Douglas County grand jury's and other official versions of the Franklin case. After Alisha Owen's conviction, Frances Mendenhall's Ne­ braska Observer devoted its July 12, 1991 issue to a dissection of the flaws in Alisha's trial, and related matters. One article was, \"Owen Trial Was a Far Cry from Justice,\" in which Mendenhall reviewed such key issues as the contradictory be­ havior of Troy Boner and the lack of any demonstrated basis for the central claim of the prosecution, that Alisha Owen was motivated by a desire for publicity. Other headlines included, \"Evidence the Owen Jury Didn't Get to See,\" \"Common Mis­ conceptions About the Owen Trial,\" \"Caradori Widow Ques­ 243"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"• • • 244 • THE FRANKLIN COVER-UP tions Fairness of '48 Hours' ,\" and \"Bonacci Recalls Early Trauma,\" which drew out the implications of dropping the charges against Paul. Thousands of copies of that Observer issue have circulated in Nebraska. Many demonstrations of support for Paul Bonacci and Alisha Owen were held in Lincoln and Omaha, outside the facilities where they have been imprisoned. A group called the Children's Civil Rights Committee was active in these, and also began holding weekly prayer meetings in Omaha, in December 1990. The Children's Civil Rights Committee has been instrumental in efforts to reinstate the Legislature's investigation into the Franklin case. Another group that played a key role in 1990 and 1991 efforts to crack the Franklin cover-up, by lobbying and literature distribution, was the Commonwealth Depositors Committee, led by Reuben Worster and Dr. Melvin Bahensky. A respected veterinarian, now in his eighties, \"Doc\" Bahensky is legendary for his spirit and tenacity in fighting to expose the wrongs in the Commonwealth and Franklin cases. He always maintains, that they are one and the same. In October 1991, the Nebraska State Parole Board voted 5-0 to parole Paul Bonacci, who has been serving a five-year sentence since 1989. On Hallowe'en, soon after a scathing World-Herald editorial against the decision, the board reversed itself. As Bonacci's attorney, I responded with the following press release: From beginning to present, Franklin has been a cauldron of cover-up skillfully executed by powerful and wealthy thieves and pedophiles. Punishment, destruction and even elimina­ tion of those who would expose or try to correct the evil wrought by these individuals is the reward of child victim­ witnesses and any who would aid those children. The perpetrators have corrupted institutions of govern­ ment. Abetted and at times absolutely led by the Omaha"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"\"SO THE TRUTH WOULD NEVER COME OUT\" • World-Herald they have systematically turned lies into truth and truth into lies. A \"free\" Paul Bonacci would continue to provide information which helps expose individuals and offenses involved in this cover-up. So, one way or another, they intend to eliminate Paul Bonacci-no matter what it takes. That is my very real fear. Therefore the World-Herald intimidated an already frightened and beleaguered parole board into effectively re­ versing their original proper decision to allow this youth out of prison. If there is a God above, the Franklin cover-up will fail and the evil and individuals involved will be exposed. Meanwhile, the visible payoff to the Parole Board will be a glowing editorial in the Omaha World Herald. Right on schedule, the World-Herald came out on November 3, 1991, with an editorial, \"Vote on Bonacci Was Sensible.\" Flaunting its clout more blatantly than ever, the paper took credit for the reversal, attributing it to lobbying by \"the press and others.\" I have often said that I wish I had never heard of the Franklin Credit Union, Larry King, or Paul Bonacci. I sincerely mean this. Why? Simply because I believe Paul Bonacci is telling the truth, and that our institutions of government have been as badly corrupted as that implies. If I still had the luxury of believing, as I once did, that the allegations of drug abuse, child abuse, pedophilia, theft and satanic cult activity were exaggerated imaginings of some over­ active child and adult imaginations, then I would not have to do anything about Franklin. I could still be enjoying an income of $400,000 per year as a lobbyist, without having to work too hard, instead of being financially strangled as clients are intimidated away from hiring me, because of the Franklin con­ nection. But I do know that it's true, and because of my upbringing, I have no choice but to plow ahead. Were there any reasons for me or others to be \"afraid or concerned\" about our lives? You make your own judgment, after I tell you about just one documented incident. At the height of the legislative Franklin investigation, when 245"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"246 • THE FRANKLIN COVER-UP the Douglas County grand jury was also going full bore, I received a phone call in the middle of the night, from a close friend of mine in Omaha, who wanted to warn me that my life might be in danger. It was approximately a week after Gary Caradori died. \"Why do you believe this?\" I asked. \"Are you sure you are not falling into a trap, overreacting to rumors?\" \"I don't know,\" answered Mary Kay Evans, a former cam­ paign chairman of mine. \"As you know, I am close to one of the University of Nebraska Board of Regents members, Dr. Robert Prokop. He called me and said he did not particularly like you or really ever get to know you, but that he felt he had an obligation, morally, to warn you.\" I knew of Dr. Prokop. Everybody in Nebraska did. Prokop had been chairman of the Board of Regents for many years. He had been a Democratic candidate for Governor of Nebraska just recently. And he was somewhat famous as a police pathologist, not only in Nebraska, but for many cities in the United States. \"What did Prokop say,\" I asked, \"that has you so con­ cerned?\" \"He simply told me he was with the police, riding around talking to individuals on the street-which he does once a month, he said-and he learned that you were supposed to be the target of an assassination, because of your Franklin involvement and trying to force the investigation there. And he said that if I cared about you, that I should call you so that at least his conscience would be clear.\" The next day, I called Dr. Robert Prokop. I told him who I was and what Mary Kay had said. I asked him if Mary Kay was imagining things, or maybe just getting carried away a bit, because of all the concern and fear that Franklin was generating. Prokop was stern and nervous. \"We really don't know each other,\" he said, \"but I feel I have a moral obligation to tell you that when I was with the police last night, one of the very reliable informants we talked to advised us that you, John DeCamp, were supposed to be the 'first hit,' instead of Gary Caradori. In other words, Mr. DeCamp, you were supposed to"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"• • • \"SO THE TRUTH WOULD NEVER COME OUT\" • be eliminated first and then Gary Caradori if that was necessary. Now that Caradori has been killed, I was concerned that maybe they will go ahead with the next hit, which means you.\" \"Are you serious?\" I asked. \"Do you really think there is even a remote possibility that could happen?\" \"I have no doubt it could happen,\" Prokop said. \"I have been doing police work and autopsies for almost as long as you have been around. And I think I know the difference between conversation and serious talk. That's why I felt I had to warn you, even if it is not my area of responsibility.\" After warning me by phone, Prokop took it upon himself to make three separate trips to Lincoln from Omaha, to meet with the legislative Franklin committee and try to warn them of the seriousness of this threat. So, am I crazy to be concerned? Is Prokop crazy? Maybe so. But there have been too many surprises for people closely involved in Franklin, who ended up dead. I was prepared to take Bill Colby's warning seriously, when he sat me down and warned me that Franklin would never be dealt with without exposure in the national and international press. What is Franklin really all about? Was it theft by a black politician of forty million dollars? Is it child abuse? Is it just a big \"homosexual party,\" as Mr. Fenner from the NCVA suggested to me? Is it laundering money for Iran-Contra? Were there murders to protect rich and powerful people? Were there politicians involved in the sins and the cover-up? Does it involve satanic cult activity and pedophilia, and exploitation of children in horrible ways? Why does the World-Herald care so much, and why has it gone overboard to damage and discredit anyone who would maintain that Franklin is more than a hoax? 247"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"248 • THE FRANKLIN COVER-UP Why do people continue to believe, that there was and is a cover-up, by prominent wealthy businessmen and politicians? What I am going to offer now are my conclusions, my beliefs, based on the massive information I have seen and heard since Franklin broke in November 1988. First, I have absolutely no doubt, that prominent individuals, whom everybody in Omaha is familiar with, and many of whom have been named during the investigation, have engaged in long-term activity involving drug peddling and drug abuse, child abuse, and pedophilia, with particular attention to the abuse of young boys. That in the case of Larry King and the cadre of people he dealt with closely, boys and girls like Paul Bonacci, Troy Boner, Danny King, and Alisha Owen were used as drug couriers for a national program of illegal narcotics marketing. They were \"throwaway\" kids. Because they were teenagers and younger when they were doing this activity, they provided a perfect insulation blanket between the real drug czars, like Larry King or Alan Baer, and the law. Larry King was able to read people and compromise people through their weaknesses. And Larry King knew whom to cater to and to compromise. Compromise the heads of institutions. Cater to the secret sins of a law enforcer, so that when you need protection, that official is not in a position to do anything but sit and watch your illegal activities. Cater to the weakness for drugs, or 13-year-old girls, or 9-year-old boys, and then blackmail as required. Yes, based on what I have seen, much of which I am legally forbidden to reveal, I have no doubt that child abuse, pedophilia, illegal drug trafficking, murder, satanic cult activity, theft, and a host of other crimes were involved in what we have come to know as the Franklin scandal. Just as surely do I believe, that there was and is a cover-up. Just as surely do I fear, that nothing will be done about it. So, let me conclude my saying simply this: Bill Colby, you were right. It is too big. I am too small. They are too rich and powerful, and go up too high in business and government, for me to touch them or do anything about it. Yes, it is something"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"\"SO THE TRUTH WOULD NEVER COME OUT\" • that I should have abandoned long ago and faced up to the fact that good does not always triumph and that evil, with its many faces, does sometimes succeed.

BOBBY AND ME It is impossible to understand the Franklin scandal and its cover­ up, without knowing the environment created in Nebraska when Robert Kerrey was governor, 1983 to 1987. It was an atmosphere of permissiveness for the rich and powerful, to do mostly as they pleased. Some of what follows, I probably should have said some time ago. Now, the prospect of Bobby Kerrey holding the highest office in the land means that I, who am knowledgeable about Kerrey in a way that probably no one but the closest of his cronies is, have no choice but to speak out. I could say much more, but I think the following episodes, in addition to what I have said in Chapter 6, are enough to shed important light on Bobby's character. I have always called him \"Bobby\" or \"Roberto.\" Bobby has always called me \"John-boy.\" Joseph Robert Kerrey and John William DeCamp. We go back about twenty years. Bobby had just returned from Vietnam with one and a half legs and the Medal of Honor and was trying to sort out his physical pain and mental bitterness toward the Vietnam experi­ ence.

Bobby had been aN avy lieutenant on special duty in Vietnam with the SEALS. I had been an Army infantry captain in the"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"APPENDIX B: BOBBY AND ME • south, in the Mekong Delta, on special assignment to John Paul Vann and a program called CORDS, which was run by then Deputy Ambassador to Vietnam, William E. Colby. Colby would later become head of the Central Intelligence Agency, under Presidents Nixon and Ford. I functioned as an infiltrator and analyst for CORDS, which in fact was more CIA than anything. Officially, CORDS was the pacification program. But that's another story. In the early 1970s, I was aware of Bobby because of his war protest activities and his Medal of Honor. He was aware of me because of my high profile and controversial activities as a state senator. One of the first things I did in Nebraska, following my return from Vietnam, was to sponsor a legislative resolution, which some viewed as a war protest, but which in reality was an attempt to open dialogue on the Vietnam War issue and to educate the politicians in the United States as to what was really occurring in Vietnam. The essence of my plea in the legislative resolution was this: Let us win or get us out of this war. Do not keep us in the position of not being allowed to win and not being allowed to lose, swinging in the wind. For the first time in its lOO-yearhistory, the Nebraska Legis­ lature voted not to allow any discussion on a resolution. It also forbade any hearing on the resolution to be held within the walls of the Nebraska State Capitol. This was how volatile this issue was back in 1971, and how adamant the elected officials in Nebraska were against anybody daring to question the propri­ ety or value of the Vietnam War. I was hurt and discouraged by this action and what I viewed as the stupidity of the Legislature, in refusing to want to learn about the issue. As I sat at my Senate desk, licking my wounds after the vote to ban any hearing on the topic, Lincoln Star reporter Don Walton came up. \"Pretty discouraging, wasn't it?\" Don asked. \"Yeah,\" I muttered angrily, \"these bastards think they can suspend the First Amendment by some vote of this legislature that effectively says the Vietnam War does not even exist. No 253"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"254 • THE FRANKLIN COVER-UP wonder they call them hayshakers. They love to wallow in their own ignorance. Sad thing is, they might actually learn something about the Vietnam War-they might even learn to understand why there are war protests.\" Don Walton bent over my desk and whispered in my ear, so no one standing around would hear. \"The way I read that resolution the Legislature just passed,\" Don said, \"was that they were not allowing any discussion on your resolution to occur inside the walls of the State Capitol. I did not see anything in that resolution that said you could not hold a hearing outside the Capitol, on the front steps.\" Don smiled. I perked up. In a flash, I knew what he meant. Defy the Legislature. Hold a hearing of our own right on the steps of the Capitol. Invite one and all to come and partici­ pate. Have any senators attend who wanted to. Let the others chicken out if they wanted, but make sure everyone got counted. And that is exactly what I did. I announced the hearing would take place on the \"north steps of the Nebraska State Capitol.\" The press did the rest. On the day of the hearing, the Capitol steps were barren of people, except for more law officers, undercover police, FBI agents, and CIA operatives than had ever been assembled in Nebraska at one time. The only senators who dared to come sit on the steps of the Capitol to participate in the hearing and listen to testimony were: Senator Terry Carpenter, the firebrand from Scottsbluff, who had gained national attention by nominat­ ing a non-existent \"Joe Smith\" for President at the Republican National Convention years ago, to mock the nomination process at conventions; Senator Ernie Chambers, who has gained state, national, and international attention for his unwavering defense of the rights of African-Americans; Senator Pol. Morgan, now Mayor Morgan of Omaha; Senator Wally Barnett, who later became Nebraska State Fire Marshall; and myself, Senator John DeCamp. As we five sat there at our make-shift hearing table on the steps, I felt disappointed. We were going to be made fools in front of the state and national press, because of the failure of"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"• • • APPENDIX B: BOBBY AND ME • the people to care enough to show up for the hearing. And I was going to be the biggest fool of all. Then we heard a distant rumble. Slowly it grew louder. As we looked north from the Capitol steps, we could see the street filled by a mass of human beings moving straight toward us. It was the most moving sight of my life. There they were, several thousand people marching on the Capitol, covering the street for blocks behind the leaders. Men in wheel chairs who had lost limbs or worse in Vietnam; combat veterans who came back shattered in spirit or mind, who had been cynical about everything but afraid to express it; students from the University of Nebraska by the thousands; and businessmen and housewives by the hundreds. In the front, leading the parade, was a young war hero named Bob Kerrey, The event turned out to be the largest hearing ever held by the Legislature, up to that time. As ideas were shared, those who supported the war and those who opposed it, including many on both sides of the issue who had fought in it, came together for the first time and communicated. It was awesome. Part way through the hearing, a group of Vietnam War veterans moved up to the podium and began depositing medals they had earned for acts of heroism. This was their way of repudiating the war, and for them it was a catharsis. Years later, there were rumors that Bob Kerrey was one of those who deposited a medal in the \"coffin\" some of the vets brought to the hearing to put the medals in. Kerrey has always denied this. In 1982, when Bobby was running for governor, his partici­ pation in the event became an issue with potentially damaging political consequences.

Besides, I don't think I was even there.\" He declared that he had been in Peru visiting his brother at the time of the hearing, so he could not have been there. I was dumbfounded. But as Bobby grew more insistent that he had not been there, I started to become confused about the matter myself. I complied with his request, taking his word, and publicly said that I must have been mistaken to say that Bobby attended the hearing. Recently, I decided to see what records there were of that special hearing, twenty years ago, where Bobby now said he was not present. In the files of the Lincoln Journal, I found a May 6, 1971 article, which identified Congressional Medal of Honor winner Bob Kerrey as one of the main speakers at the rally. The article said, \"A Nebraska native and Vietnam Congressional Medal of Honor winner, Robert Kerrey, in a prepared statement said that the 'Viet Cong or North Vietnam­ ese troops are angelic compared with the ruthless Americans.' \" I checked the files of the World-Herald. They also report Bobby as a speaker at the hearing. Two days after the event, Bobby wrote a letter to the Journal in which he said that what he meant was that\" ... the evidence of atrocities in Vietnam is sufficient to support an argument against all wars .... \" Over the next several years, we had little contact. Bobby entered the restaurant business and-with a little help from a law I helped amend, that let an individual obtain more liquor licenses than were allowed until then-began to do quite well.

Bobby and I next had quite a bit to do with each other in 1982, during the Nebraska gubernatorial race. I was there when the state's leading powerbrokers anointed Bobby as the next governor, in fact it was I who suggested they anoint him. That is a fascinating story, but let me first give a little necessary back­ ground. Starting in the mid-1970s, a debate over the structure of Nebraska's banking industry emerged as the issue which would dominate state politics for a decade. Officially dubbed \"Multi­ Bank,\" the issue was a turf battle of monumental proportions, over who was going to own the banks in Nebraska, and what competition was going to be allowed in the purchase of exist­ ing banks. On one side were the \"Independents,\" who advocated owner­ ship of banks by individuals. The Independents were very strong in Nebraska, as in many rural states. On a per capita basis, as I recall, we probably had more banks than almost any other state in the United States. On the opposing side were the \"Big Banks,\" particularly those based in Omaha, the state's largest city. Nebraska law forbade holding companies, which could own many banks. If holding companies were allowed, the big banks would naturally start buying up a lot of small banks-\"Multi-Bank.\" That was the issue. In 1976, I won the chairmanship of the Senate Banking Committee, which controlled banking, finance and insurance in Nebraska. That is, I thought I won it. I know today that I 257"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"258 • THE FRANKLIN COVER-UP was merely the bright young legislator selected by powerful men in business and politics, to aid their efforts to change the banking structure in Nebraska. I believed at the time, that the banking structure changes I was proposing, which would allow the big banks to get bigger, were good for Nebraska. I thought they were necessary, as well as probably inevitable. It was this battle over bank structure, that next brought Bobby and me together. In 1978, the banking forces I supported determined that we had likely assembled enough senators in the recent election, to pass the Multi-Bank structural changes. But we had to be sure that if we passed the legislation, we could get it signed by the governor. A veto would be fatal. It was possible to get a majority of votes to pass the legislation, but electing enough senators to override a governor's veto might take two or three elections, or forever. It would be much faster and cheaper, the big boys concluded, to control the governor. Accordingly, at a very private meeting between a Nebraska congressman named Charles Thone; the state's then-premiere lobbyist, Jim Ryan; Omaha National Bank President and CEO John Woods; Omaha National Vice President Don Adams; and myself, certain agreements were reached. The meeting was held at John Woods' personal residence in Fair Acres, Omaha, in a quiet \"servants' quarters\" outside the main house. The understanding was clear, that we would work to make Charles Thone governor. And Charles Thone, who said he strongly believed in our Multi-Bank bill, gave his iron-clad pledge that he would sign it, just as soon as we could \"put it on my desk.\" But the best laid plans of mice and men go oft awry, and that is what happened with the new governor, Charles Thone. Charlie liked being governor. Charlie was cautious. Charlie did not want to do anything that made anybody unhappy. The last thing Charlie needed after being in office for a couple of years, was to have a controversial issue on which he had to play King Solomon, which would make one or another powerful group hate him, no matter what he did."},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"APPENDIX B: BOBBY AND ME • Multi-Bank was exactly that. The two contending groups of banks financed almost all major political races in Nebraska­ on both sides-for almost a decade. Politicians would pledge their support to either the Independents or to the Big Banks, led by Omaha National (later to merge with First National of Lincoln to become FirsTier), as the first step toward running for public office, particularly for the Legislature. Some politicians came to believe that they would never really have to cast a vote on the issue, because there would never be enough votes to get the bill passed. Therefore, they could promise to support Multi-Bank, without having to worry about a final vote or signature on the bill. Charles Thone was apparently one of those. As long as the bill never reached his desk, he could promise till the cows came home that he would sign the bill, but he would never be held accountable. But on a fateful day in 1980, something happened in the Legislature that nobody dreamed possible. It had never hap­ pened in the first one hundred years of Nebraska history. There was a tie vote, 24 to 24. Nebraska's unicameral Legislature has 49 Senators, but on this day, Senator Ernie Chambers decided to sit on his hands, rather than vote for what he regarded as one bunch of evil-doers against another. Then, in an act of dubious legality, Lieutenant Governor Roland Luedtke cast the deciding ballot in favor of the Big Banks. Never before had a lieutenant governor voted on anything. Governor Charles Thone was in a dilemma. If he signed the bill, he incurred the wrath of the powerful independent bankers. If he did not, he betrayed the promise he had made to John Woods and the Omaha business community, who were intent on this piece of legislation. Charlie did the smart thing. He left town and criticized Luedtke for having improperly voted for the bill. Luedtke re­ sponded by putting on the hat of Acting Governor, and signed the bill into law. The story did not end there. On instructions from Attorney General Paul Douglas, who favored the independent bankers, the newly passed law was not entered into the statutes. It was as if it had never passed. 259"},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"260 • THE FRANKLIN COVER-UP In the next year's legislative session, the Big Bank forces came back with guns blazing. Led by me on the floor of the Legislature and in the Banking Committee, we marched the legislation slowly but surely through three legislative votes and to a final showdown with Governor Thone. We had a bare majority, but nowhere near enough votes to override a governor's veto. On a spring day, as Charlie was dreaming of an easy reelec­ tion, as the newspapers were saying that he was unbeatable, being a Republican governor in a Republican state, who had done nothing really right or really wrong, we laid the newly passed legislation on Charlie's desk. John Woods sent clear messages to Charlie Thone, that he was expected to live up to his promise to sign the legislation. But the Independent Bankers had their own ace in the hole. They had the leading independent banker in the state meet one­ on-one with Charlie and \"explain the facts of life.\" The facts were these: 1. That if Charlie signed the legislation he would be politically dead, because ... 2. The Independent Bankers would organize a referendum on the newly passed legis­ lation and put the issue on the ballot in the next election, where ... 3. As Charlie, we and everybody else knew, it would almost certainly be defeated, because the voting public was inclined to support the Independents. Charlie would be done for. Charlie got the message. He vetoed the bill. With that veto, Charlie's political doom was sealed, and the door was opened for Bob Kerrey to be the next Governor of Nebraska. Until then, Bobby was still frying hamburgers at his restaurant, and was no closer to the governorship, to Debra Winger, or to Hollywood than the local movie theater. John Woods was adamant. So was super-lobbyist Jim Ryan. Charlie Thone must be eliminated. It was time to come up with other candidates. To my suggestion that they seriously consider supporting me for Governor, the answer was unanimous. I was too contro­ versial. I had too much political \"baggage.\" I would not like being governor. I was too effective as a legislator and besides, as everybody knows, except for signing bills, the Governor of Nebraska is not as powerful as independent legislators."},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"• • • APPENDIX B: BOBBY AND ME • What they said was probably true. They wanted me as their power broker in the Legislature. I suggested we get behind a young man named Bob Kerrey. For a couple of years, there had been talk about Bobby. I had even dreamed, as I told Bobby many times, of running for Governor, with Bobby as Lieutenant Governor. I knew others were encouraging Bobby, too. From that meeting on, it was a done deal. Jimmy Ryan and Omaha National Bank Vice President Don Adams were assigned the task of meeting with Bobby privately to sort out whether he would support Multi-Bank legislation. Bob Kerrey filed as a candidate. A lot of people found it remarkable, that Democrat Bob Kerrey had the heavy support of the normally totally Republican Big Bank establishment. In November 1982, Kerrey became Governor of Nebraska. His first public appearance as Governor was to testify before my Banking Committee for Multi-Bank. Shortly thereafter, he signed the bill into law. Though the support of John Woods and the Omaha business community was the most critical factor in Kerrey's election, there was another force in Nebraska politics at the time, whose support was believed to be practically indispensable to winning the election. This was the pro-life movement. The vocal head of the pro-life group, Senator Bernice Labedz of Omaha, was more than just another state senator and more than just another pro-life leader. She was the matriarch of the Democratic Party. She was close friends with both of Nebras­ ka's U.S. Senators, J. James Exon and Edward Zorinsky, for each of whom she had worked as office manager. Her support for a candidate guaranteed tens of thousands of votes. Bernice wanted to support Bobby Kerrey, but she was not going to support anybody who was not pro-life.

Your courageous leadership in advancing respect for human life, promoting a strong family and a decent society, has been an inspiration to me as well as thousands of our fel­ low Nebraskans.

Since becoming a candidate for Governor, I have consis­ tently stated my opposition to abortion. As recently as May 14, 1982, in both the Omaha World-Herald and the Lincoln Journal, I stated, \"I find abortion to be morally repugnant.\" It was in the Omaha World-Herald on May 14, 1982, that I also stated clearly that my position was not \"pro-choice.\" I believe the unborn to be human life and entitled to all the protections the State can legally offer for the preservation of life ... I believe there are many important challenges that face us over the next few years. Reducing the number of abortions in our State and working with you toward the elimination of the need for even a single abortion will be of a highest priority. I am confident working in partnership with you in the years ahead will be one of the most rewarding experi­ ences of my life.

Polls showed that only a candidate who would have the support of the pro-choice movement, stood a chance to beat George Bush. Bobby's first substantive act in his presidential campaign was to repeat a pattern I had seen during the years I worked with him. He repudiated everything he had previously said on the subject of abortion, acknowledged that he had been essentially fibbing in his pro-life statements, and admitted that he had given the previous false commitments purely for the purpose of getting elected. Campaigning in New Hampshire, Kerrey was quoted in the October 17,1991 World-Herald, regarding his letter to Senator Labedz: \"It was a political act, yeah, and an act about which I feel very little pride .... The whole issue of not just abortion but many of the other emotional issues in 1982 were extremely difficult. I didn't know what public policy was for certain, should be for certain, and-as a result-I was all over the map.\" The Multi-Bank legislation was not Governor Robert Ker­ rey's only foray into state banking law. In 1983-84, the state's banks were experiencing severe problems. In the summer of 1984, Kerrey called a special legislative session to deal with these problems, but specified that it would not deal with the most notorious of them, Commonwealth, whose collapse he himself had precipitated with his infamous press statement of October 31, 1983. As the Legislature convened, however, Kerrey expanded the session to handle a completely new proposal of his own crafting, which did bear on Commonwealth and State Security. Kerrey's crony Bill Wright was involved. Kerrey's new proposal was for a special form of interstate banking, in which only one out-of-state banking group would be allowed to take over Nebraska financial institutions. It would be arranged so that this single out-of-state group, a Colorado­ 263"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"264 • THE FRANKLIN COVER-UP based combine with which Kerrey's associates were secretly working, would quietly take over Commonwealth and State Security, in return for the interstate banking monopoly. I had been sponsoring legislation to allow legitimate inter­ state banking, but this was not legitimate. It was clear to me that the reason for the Kerrey administration's approach to Commonwealth, was to cover up a multitude of sins related to State Security, owned by Kerrey's intimate Bill Wright. I met with Bobby. We talked intensely. I made clear that I would support a competitive and reciprocal interstate banking proposal, which I thought would help all Nebraskans, not one that would be used to bail out individuals involved in what I felt was corruption. I mentioned for the first time to him, face to face, the role of his friend and adviser Bill Wright. When we ended our discussion, I thought Bobby would abandon his idea, and accept an interstate banking proposal along my lines. A legitimate interstate bank bill, however, could not be used by Bobby and his friends for their personal purposes, related to Commonwealth and State Security. From that standpoint, Kerrey, directed by Bill Wright, had to push through his peculiar form of interstate banking. Led by his chief of staff, W. Don Nelson, Kerrey lined up enough votes to bypass my Banking Committee and railroad his bill through the Legislature and onto his desk where he could sign it. Or so he thought. They had their votes lined up. It required 25 of the 49 to pass the legislation. Most senators knew less about the legisla­ tion than a sow knows about Sunday. But by using the most traditional political methods, carrot and stick, the Kerrey ad­ minstration had gotten commitments from twenty-six senators. They were ready to roll. Roll they did, using the most powerful lobbyists and the heaviest pressure the administration could put on. Through a technicality, I was able to stop them dead in their tracks. I invoked a procedural ruling, which forced them to have thirty votes to ever get to a vote on the bill itself. They had twenty­ six votes, not thirty. Bobby was angry.

When I got there, reporters were calling me for my response to Bob Kerrey's latest action. \"What action was that?\" I inquired. \"Bob Kerrey has declared you a 'non-person' whose exis­ tence he will no longer recognize in any way,\" they said. \"How can you declare somebody a ghost?\" I asked. \"How does Bob Kerrey think he has the authority to declare me a 'non-person'? What planet is he living on that he thinks he has this incredible power?\" I thought for a minute. Bobby was riding as high as any governor ever had in Nebraska. Movie star Debra Winger was now living in the mansion with him part time. All Nebraska was in love with Bobby and Debby. Camelot was here, and Nebraskans were lapping it up. There were pictures of Bobby fluffing up a pillow, smiling and saying, \"Just fluff up your pillow and dream about it\"-his response when asked what it was like to date Debra Winger. I knew the press was in love with Bobby, and that anything I said had to be simple and not susceptible of distortion. \"Bobby has to learn that there is more to being a governor than macho and movie stars,\" I told the press. Later, when I returned to Lincoln from Dallas, I learned from a close friend of mine and of Bobby, a prominent lobbyist, that immediately after the legislative vote in which I stopped his banking proposal, Bobby stormed out of the Governor's office and down to the doors just outside the Legislature, where he yelled out a threat: \"I know you lobbyists worked for John DeCamp to stop me on this. Well, I promise you one thing. DeCamp is 'dead meat. ' Do you hear me? DeCamp is 'dead meat.' I mean it!\" When I was an infantry captain in Vietnam, the phrase \"dead meat\" was well known. It was what a soldier, usually an enlisted man, threatened an officer with just before \"fragging\" him. \"Fragging\" was a live grenade tossed into the tent, living quar­ ters, or restroom facility of another soldier, most commonly an officer. Live grenades usually kill or maim people. Bobby knew that. His foot was most probably blown off by a live grenade 265"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"266 • THE FRANKLIN COVER-UP that either the enemy threw or, as he himself has indicated, one of his own men accidentally dropped near him. Originally no one dreamed Bobby would be recommended for a Medal of Honor. Recently disclosed records show that as the Pentagon attempted to \"popularize\" the war, the word came down to create more heroes, to recommend more wounded for medals. Since there were more places to fill on the list, Bobby's name suddenly popped onto the bottom of it. This may be a crude way of putting things, but since the Medal of Honor is being cited by the press as the apparent best evidence of Bobby's qualifications to be President, it is legitimate to discuss it. And I do not think Bobby would deny this. In 1984, Bobby knew that this lobbyist would deliver the message that I was \"dead meat,\" which he did. It occurred to me that I might be dealing with an emotionally disturbed individual. I had no doubts, as to how important the legislation was to help bailout and cover up the State Security scandal, in which Bobby and his friend Bill Wright were involved. And I knew how detrimental such legislation would be to the rest of Nebraska's million and a half citizens. A governor or legislator does not go completely nuts over a proposal the way Bobby did, unless he has something personal at stake. And I was well aware of what Bobby and his friends had hanging on their interstate banking plan. The more I learned about State Security, the extent of the thievery that had occurred there, and the fact that the publicity about Commonwealth was being used as a smokescreen to protect State Security from a deeper probe, the more at odds Bobby and I became. As I kept the heat on with continual demands for an investiga­ tion of State Security, Bill Wright left town. When the press confronted Kerrey as to why Wright was gone, an angry Kerrey snapped, that Bill Wright was \"driven out of town by John DeCamp.\" Finally, the Legislature agreed to allow my Banking Com­ mittee to investigate the State Security situation.

It is my belief, that the reason Robert Kerrey did not run for reelection, was because of this investigation and where he thought it would lead. The best evidence I can give of this, is what happened after the November 1986 election. Kerrey did not run for reelection. I was defeated for reelection to the Legislature. Bobby and I sat down for a heart to heart talk. I had not yet issued the committee report. I had determined to wait until after the election, so that it would not appear that I was using it as a campaign tool. Bobby wanted to know what I was going to say about him in the report. \"As far as I am concerned,\" I told Bobby, \"I have no reason to go after you.

I have no reason to pick on you, because it was really Bill Wright who masterminded the State Security swindle, though you obviously played a role in it. I am not out to hurt you. We both have been hurt enough and blamed enough.\" As far as I was concerned, Bill Wright was the key villain, and that is what I said in the State Security report. Perhaps I felt a bit sorry for myoid friend who left half his leg in Vietnam. Two years later, Bobby and I had occasion to get together again for some very serious business.

So, why make an issue of Kerrey and Commonwealth and State Security now? Because too much is at stake. Patterns associated with Kerrey from his earliest days in public life, which were accentuated in the Commonwealth/State Security affairs, are being repeated now in the Franklin matter, and have the possibility of being amplified onto the national level, if Robert Kerrey became Pres­ ident. What are those patterns? 1. Abuse of public positions for one's own financial benefit. This is an invariant of Kerrey' s career, from his first appearance in student politics at the University of Nebraska in 1964-65, where he was censured by the Student Council for pocketing profits from a Student Council program he was in charge of. We saw the same thing again in Commonwealth/State Security and the NIFA loan scam. 2. Shifting political position 180 degrees with the prevailing winds. When it was fashionable to be against the Vietnam War, Kerrey led the parade. When it became a political liability, he chucked his opposition overboard, and lied about it. When he needed votes and he could get them by denouncing abortion, he did so. When he thought the best way to get votes was to be pro-abortion, he embraced that position. In the lead-up to the Gulf war, Bobby was strongly against it. When it was clear that the war was popular, Bobby decided he had been \"uninformed\" before and switched his stance. I saw this happen so many times, I used to call him \"Flip­ flop Bobby\" to his face. 3. Acting as a puppet of forces behind the scenes.

His personal and business relationships with the owners and publishers of the Lincoln Journal guaranteed that truth would be sacrificed to conve­ nience.

Kerrey found himself on a podium in New Hampshire, sitting next to fellow-candidate Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas. Not realizing a microphone was on, he told Clinton a dirty joke that was offensive to lesbians and homosexuals, whom he has otherwise supported. Some of the nation's press attacked him for his crudity. But here is how the World-Herald, run by his business partner Jack Gottschalk, covered it in an editorial entitled \"Kerrey, Too, Deserves Apology.\" Bob Kerrey is right when he says he shouldn't have repeated the crude story he told Bill Clinton in a private conversation in New Hampshire. Nonetheless, it would be unjust if this stupid, minor, blown-out-of-proportion incident were to hurt Kerrey's campaign for the Democratic presidential nomi­ nation. The World-Herald gave a tortured argument, that Kerrey was only telling Clinton the joke as an example of jokes which should not be told. At that, I had to laugh, because of a sense of deja vu. It was one unforgettable thing about politicians close to the Kerrey administration, that they habitually used a dirty or racial joke to open a conversation. Bill Hoppner, now chairman of Kerrey's presidential campaign, was the master of masters, when it came to telling the raunchiest sexist or ethnic joke. And this particular joke, Bobby Kerrey himself told years before, only then he used my name instead of Jerry Brown's! Bobby's friends at the World-Herald, however, concluded: The senator on Tuesday apologized to anyone who took offense at the story. It was the proper and political thing to do. The way the story developed, however, Kerrey may be the target of a carefully crafted sabotage operation. Perhaps someone should apologize to him.

If you are about to be compromised or tarnished by your own record, act swiftly, before a scandal develops. Make a tearful confession to a friendly press conduit about your \"youthful indiscretion\" or your \"regrettable shortsightedness.\" Take something that could and maybe should destroy you politically, and tum it into an asset. When Bobby needed to clean up his image on banking matters in order to attack George Bush's handling of the S&L crisis, he staged a confession to Kotok of the World-Herald, that yes, perhaps, being new to politics and all, he had relied a tad too much on the advice of Bill Wright in the Common­ wealth/State Security affair.

My closest friend and mentor, Bill Colby, like so many others in the Franklin case, is dead; he was fished out of a river in front of his home, under the most questionable of circumstances, in April 1996. Was he killed because of his involvement in Franklin? I don't know. What I do know, is that Bill Colby was the heart and soul of the Franklin investigation. Although at a certain point he warned me against investigating the case further, it was he who relentlessly pushed to publicly expose what had already been discovered, when everyone else, including, at times, myself, wanted to call it quits. Without him, this book would never have been written. In the new, final chapter of this second edition, I tell much more about my relationship to Bill Colby, who was, in my estimation, one of the greatest patriots this country has seen, from the time that he served as our country's Deputy Ambassador to South Vietnam (but, in reality, as CIA Station Chief), and recruited a young combat infantry captain named John DeCamp to be one of his chief assistants in Operation Phoenix, right through to his role in trying to blow open the Franklin cover-up. I published The Franklin Cover-Up, as much as an insurance policy for myself and my family, as for any other purpose. Colby had pointed to the extreme danger for a person to have secret knowledge about a situation, that others who are affected want to keep out of the public's view. \"Some people will go to any lengths to make sure things stay secret,\" Colby had often repeated to me, \"which is why the CIA and the KGB sometimes find their agents dead. Your 277"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"278 • THE FRANKLIN COVER·UP best interest,\" he argued, \"may well be in publishing what you know and are able to prove, rather than keeping those facts secret. Whether you ever sell a single book or not does not really matter. Putting your information on the public record is what is important. That way, there is no logical reason to harm you or your family, to suppress some truth you have already documented. That is probably your real life insurance policy in something like this Franklin situation,\" Colby had advised me. Now, four years later, without a single dollar spent in adver­ tising or promotion, over 50,000 copies of this book have been sold nationwide. I am convinced that this is why I am alive today, although I did receive a warning in September 1996, through reliable sources, that I am targeted-i-vjust like they got Colby.\" There have also been innumerable attempts to disbar me. Although I have thus far been able to defeat every one of these attempts, they keep coming; to silence me through disbarment is, for those trying to hide the truth on Franklin, the equivalent of assassinating me. So, the battle continues, both in the Franklin case per se-about which I include stunning new material which proves the truth of Part I of this book­ and in the new cases in which I have become involved. As a result of the first publication of The Franklin Cover-Up, as an attorney, I have become involved in some of the most famous legal cases now occurring in these United States, from cases involving the militia movement, to the Oklahoma City bomb­ ing, to the notorious Gordon Kahl shootout with U.S. Marshals, about which documentaries and movies have been made, to appearances before the U.S. Senate on all of these matters, including Ruby Ridge and Waco. I have appeared on all of the national TV networks, and on many national shows, such as Nightline with Ted Koppel, Good Morning America, CNN's Burden of Proof, America's Most Wanted, and others. So, I say, as I dedicate this second edition of The Franklin Cover-Up to my friend and mentor, William Colby: \"Thanks, Bill. You were right, so right it terrifies me.

This concluding chapter will reveal more about Colby's role in Franklin, and his very last instructions to me, two weeks before his death. Finally, the last word on the Franklin cover-up is delivered in the epilogue-not by me, but by the nineteenth-century novelist Herman Melville. Besides his famous Moby Dick, Melville wrote short stories. A high-ranking personage in­ volved in the Franklin case, told me that one of these stories contained the ultimate secret behind the Franklin cover-up.

My victory in that case was but one of a series of what I call the \"mini-miracles\"-perhaps a hundred or more unforeseen events since the book first hit the streets, which prove the truth of The Franklin Cover-Up. I have chosen a small sampling of these \"mini-miracles\" to recount here. After this book appeared, attorneys for Franklin-related indi­ viduals repeatedly appeared in the printed media (particularly in the Omaha World Herald) and on TV to make statements such as: \"This book is the most libelous and slanderous book I have ever read.

That is certain. This book will be stopped and Mr. DeCamp will be proved to be a liar and made to pay damages.\" When reporters who interviewed the lawyers or principals named in the book contacted me for my response to their threats, I had one standard answer: \"I agree with certain things these people and their attorneys attacking me are saying. I agree that the things described in this book are horrible. If anyone had said these things about me, I agree that I would sue them. I believe if there is anything false in this book or if they believe I have not told the truth in this book, that they should sue me. In fact, I welcome their law suits, because that will help develop the truth. I personally believe I have been most careful and cautious in the way I . have handled matters, and only written about those things I can absolutely document.\" So, what happened with those threats? Who sued whom? Who proved what? The only major lawsuit for libel and slander arising from this book was my suit against Atlantic Telecast, owner of a television station in Wilmington, North Carolina, WECT (Channel 6). I charged that statements made on a WECT news broadcast on November 12, 1992, attacking me and the book, were false. I demanded a retraction and public apology. The first response I received was from WECT's station manager, who informed me that WECT had consulted its attor­ neys, that the station had thoroughly investigated the matters described in my book, and that WECT was not only not going to apologize, but planned to repeat the attacks. WECT's attorney further advised me that the station had investigated, in part, by talking to U.S. Senator Bob Kerrey from Nebraska, who was running for president of the United States at the time, and who had visited Wilmington, and met with representatives of the TV station. Further investigation, he claimed, was conducted by talking to the new Wilmington police chief, a man named Robert Wadman-the former police chief of Omaha, Nebraska, who had come to Wilmington in the early 1990s! 28\\"},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"282 • THE FRANKLIN COVER-UP After hearing this, I gave a simple demand to WECT: \"Rest assured I am ready to prove everything I wrote in my book. I hope you are ready and able to prove your claims made on TV. I give you three weeks for further investigation, and then I will move forward aggressively on my lawsuit against you. At that time, I will seek not only an apology, but substantial monetary damages.\" Just under three weeks from the date of my ultimatum, attorneys from Atlantic Telecast contacted me and stated that they had done further investigation and acknowledged that now they, not I, were in trouble. Shortly thereafter, a settlement agreement was reached which stipulated: (l) WECT TV would broadcast a retraction and public apology to me on its news broadcasts, and would issue a press release to the same effect; (2) WECT would pay me money damages and other financial benefits; (3) All other de­ tails of the settlement, other than those stated above, would be kept confidential for the benefit of the TV station. I accepted the settlement offer, and dismissed my lawsuit. WECT lived up to its part of the settlement, and I have lived up to mine. My lawsuit intersected a fierce political battle between Chief Wadman, upon whom WECT had relied for its information, and his own police department, particularly with an officer named Sgt. Robert Clatty. Sgt. Clatty is the Wilmington Police Department's expert on satanic ritual abuse of children, and is one of North Carolina's recognized experts as well, with published works on the subject. Chief Wadman, on the other hand, claimed that there was no such thing as satanic ritual abuse; he attempted to make it impossible for Sgt. Clatty to carry out his work, and, at one point, suspended him. The publicly waged war between Chief Wadman and his wide array of defenders in Wilmington and across North Caro­ lina, and Wadman's adversaries, led primarily by Officer Clatty, went as high as the State Legislature. From 1992 until roughly mid-1994, it divided the city of Wilmington, and even the state of North Carolina. The outcome of the war between Chief Wadman and his"},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"• • • INVESTIGATION, AND COVER·UP, CONTINUE • own force was that in early July 1994, a secret meeting was held with city officials and Wadman's attorney. On July II, 1994, Wadman resigned as police chief. Although city officials refused to comment on what had transpired in the meeting, Wadman himself admitted in a television interview later that month, that he had been ordered to resign from the Wilmington Police Department. In May 1992, shortly after the first edition of this book was published, Monsignor Robert Hupp, who had been the head of Boys Town from the late 1970s through the decade of the 1980s-the critical time in question for the Franklin case, contacted me and asked to have a meeting, at which he specified that witnesses must be present. I anticipated that his purpose was to attack me, and to deny what I had written about Boys Town. I was completely wrong. With two witnesses present, Monsi­ gnor Hupp opened our discussion with the simple statement: \"John DeCamp, your book stated the game; I hope I can help with some of the names.\" Monsignor Hupp and I then entered into an in-depth discus­ sion on the entire situation involving Boys Town, Larry King, Peter Citron, the pedophile problem in general, and the entire story of the Franklin cover-up. He verified piece after piece of evidence of the Franklin story for me, and provided guidance on other directions in which to look, to develop further proof of the children's stories of abuse by this country's wealthy and powerful. When I asked Monsignor Hupp how this ever could have happened at Boys Town, he looked at me and told me, so apologetically, \"I am like the wife who did not know, and was the last to find out. And when I finally did suspect something and tried to act, the Archbishop [Daniel Sheehan] elected to do nothing about it, when I asked him to help. And then, when I came upon something horribly evil, I found public officials and the Church would do nothing-apparently terrified at the 283"},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"284 • THE FRANKLIN COVER-UP damage it would do to the Church and to the entire city of Omaha,\" Monsignor Hupp said. \"What are you talking about?\" I asked him. \"Is there some particular story or incident you are talking about in the book that you have more information about? Please explain what you mean,\" I asked the Monsignor. He then described an incident in 1985, in which a young boy named Shattuck, who lived in Elkhorn, Nebraska, had been sexually abused and then killed. The Monsignor told me that he was certain who had killed the boy, a man he identified as a member of the Catholic clergy in the Omaha Archdiocese. Monsignor Hupp provided precise detail which he said proved beyond any doubt, that the particular individual he named was, in fact, the child's murderer. \"The Church is plagued by these sexual abuse problems across the country and by the devastating publicity the clergy abuse incidents have caused,\" Monsignor Hupp explained. \"The Church's reaction to these sexual abuse problems is, in most cases, to immediately get the clergy member involved out of the state and, if possible, out of the country, and hopefully into treatment. I know that may not be right, but it is a difficult situation to deal with, and simply moving the priest or the brother out of the state or country has been the traditional approach by the Church in America to addressing the problems. In this case, where an innocent child was murdered and where 1 know that a member of our clergy has done this, I felt I had a moral obligation overriding all other things, to bring the situation to the attention of the appropriate authorities. And I did,\" Hupp concluded. The Monsignor then shocked me for the second time that day-and in a way that brought back to me the horrible memo­ ries of the Franklin cover-up. He explained that after he determined that the Catholic Arch­ bishop of Omaha was not going to take action on the case, he then went to the FBI and to the Omaha law enforcement authorities to provide complete details on the child's murder. So, what happened as a result of Monsignor Hupp's actions? Apparently, nothing.

In September 1992, the Monsignor advised me that he was receiving all kinds of pressure and criticism and was, he feared, being forced to leave Boys Town. Shortly after that discussion, in a controversy that received national press attention on how resources should be used at Boys Town, Monsignor Hupp was removed from his post. He now lives quietly in a home in West Omaha, Nebraska. Monsignor Hupp has shown incredible courage, as he has con­ tinued to provide me direction and assistance in the Franklin investigation and related matters. Monsignor Hupp is not some 13-year-old kid whom the cops say they cannot trust or believe. On the contrary, he is one of America's most famous and nationally honored clergy­ men; the author of two best sellers; a former Presidential Ap­ pointee as Special Ambassador to the United Nations; and the former head of America's most famous child care institution (Boys Town). Monsignor Hupp showed his courage yet again, when he repeated his charges a year later to a British TV team making a documentary on the Franklin cover-up, entitled Conspiracy of Silence. In mid-1993, after The Franklin Cover- Up had been circulat­ ing for almost a year, the British-based TV station, Yorkshire Television, sent a top-notch team to Nebraska to launch its own investigation of the Franklin case. Yorkshire had a contract with the Discovery Channel to produce a documentary on the case for American television. They spent many months in Nebraska, and also traveled this country from one end to the other, interviewing, filming, and 285"},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"286 • THE FRANKLIN COVER-UP documenting piece-by-piece the Franklin story as I had told it in the book. They spent somewhere between a quarter-million and one-half million dollars investigating the story, deploying probably a thousand times the resources and abilities that I personally had. Over the year that I worked with them, I was amazed at the team's ability to gather new documents and witnesses which kept opening up new and frightening facts about Franklin. They were a crack team. In the final weeks that they were in Nebraska, they expressed their certainty that they would win awards for this documented horror story of government-sanctioned drug­ running involving children; government-sanctioned abuse of children; and government protection of some of this country's most powerful businessmen and politicians, who had been the chief actors in the Franklin story. Finally, the big day came. Their documentary was to air nationwide on the Discovery Channel on May 3, 1994. It was advertised in the TV Guide and in newspapers for that day. But no one ever saw that program. At the last minute, and without explanation, it was pulled from the air. It was not shown then, and has never been broadcast anywhere since. I have a copy of that program, which arrived anonymously in my mail in late 1995. When I watched this pirated copy, I could see clearly why the program had been suppressed. Conspiracy of Silence proved, beyond doubt, that the essential points I had stressed in the book (and more) were all true. For instance, the team had interviewed Troy Boner. Some­ time after that grand jury was over, Troy, guilt-stricken because of his lying over Gary Caradori's death, contacted me and told the truth about what had happened. This is recorded in a remarkable affidavit (see Chapter 20). The Yorkshire TV team spent a small fortune to confirm Troy's charges. They flew Troy to Chicago and paid for a lengthy polygraph (lie detector) test at the Keeler Polygraph Institute. With the results of that test, the Yorkshire team was so convinced that Troy was telling the truth, that they featured him in their documentary. It was only in mid-1996, that I finally pieced together,"},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"INV.ESTIGATION, AND COVER-UP, CONTINUE. through sources I am not at liberty to disclose, what happened to stop the broadcast of this documentary. 1. At the time the Yorkshire TV team and the Discovery Channel were doing the documentary, they had no idea how high up the case would go into Government, and what major institutions and personalities in this country, would be found to be linked to the Franklin story. Ultimately, the documentary focused on several limited aspects documented in this book, and developed them much more extensively than I ever had the resources or abilities to accomplish. 2. These areas which the documentary focused on, were: (a) the use and involvement of Boys Town children and person­ alities in the Franklin Scandal, particularly Peter Citron and Larry King's relationships to Boys Town; (b) the linkage of Franklin to some of this country's top politicians in Washing­ ton, and in the U.S. Congress, with particular attention on those who attended parties held by Larry King at his Washington mansion on Embassy Row; (c) the impropriety of these politi­ cians and businessmen and compromising of these people by Larry King, through drugs and using children for pedophilia. 3. When the broadcast tape was sent to the United States, Customs officials seized the documentary and held it up as being \"pornographic material.\" Attorneys for Discovery Channel and Yorkshire TV were able to get the documentary released. Then, the lawyers went through the film for months, making this or that change or deletion, so that the documentary ultimately advertised to be shown on the Discovery Channel on May 3, 1994, would survive any claims of libel or slander that any of the individuals identified in the documentary might attempt to bring. The lawyers had cleared the documentary for broadcast. 4. During the several months that the documentary was being prepared and advertised for showing, major legislation impacting the entire future of the Cable TV industry was being debated on Capitol Hill. Legislation, which the industry op­ posed, was under debate for placing controls on the industry and the contents of what could be shown. Messages were delivered in no uncertain terms from key politicians involved 287"},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"288 • THE FRANKLIN COVER·UP in the Cable TV battle, that if the Conspiracy of Silence were shown on the Discovery Channel as planned, then the industry would probably lose the debate. An agreement was reached: Conspiracy of Silence was pulled, and with no rights for sale or broadcast by any other program; Yorkshire TV would be reimbursed for the costs of production; the Discovery Channel itself would never be linked to the documentary; and copies of Conspiracy in Silence would be destroyed. Not all copies were destroyed, however, as I and some others received anonymously in the mail a copy of the nearly­ finished product. . . . I said in Chapter 12, \"The Omaha Business Community\": \"As essential to Franklin as [Harold] Andersen's fundraising and publicity were, the credit union could not have functioned for a single day without the complicity of Nebraska's largest bank, FirsTier .... Every dollar that went into Franklin Credit Union-the missing $40 million was no exception-went into its account #153-7-353 at FirsTier.\" In October 1994, evidence released through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) proved exactly how right I was. These FOIA documents showed that some of the same attorneys who had threatened so loudly to sue me, together with the FirsTier Bank with which they were associated, had reached a finan­ cial settlement with the National Credit Union Association (NCUA), in which they agreed to pay the NCUA $10 million in damages for their role in improprieties involving Franklin. The attorneys had to come up with over $6 million, and First Tier itself, over $3 million. Despite the fact that the FirsTier case was the biggest mal­ practice settlement in the history of Nebraska, and despite the fact that the settlement involved very prominent individuals­ including former Republican Governor Charlie Thone and at­ torney Jay Derr-the story received almost no coverage in the press, that is, before the FOIA material became public. Then, the World Herald jumped in with a huge editorial in October"},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"• • • INV.ESTIGATION, AND COVER.UP, CONTINUE. 1994, entitled \"Franklin Credit Union Crimes Unfairly Claim New Victims.\" The World Herald wrote: \"Some defendants, including banks and a law firm, have agreed to pay more than $10 million to the NCUA to settle the claims. They admitted no wrongdoing. They said they acted to avoid prolonged litigation. Their position is understandable. Litigation is expensive. Moreover, this particular litigation ran the risk of creating a false impression. ... The impression could have taken hold that a wide circle of legal and financial advisers sat on the knowledge that King was looting the credit union .... Such an impression would have been false.\" There was, indeed, \"a wide circle of legal and financial advisers\" in on the looting of Franklin, just as I had charged, and whom I name in Chapter 12, \"The Omaha Business Com­ munity.\" Finally, some of them, at least, had to pay for it. Nor was this the only multi-million dollar scam to be exposed in the wake of the first edition of this book. In Chapter 6, I described another big money scheme that intersected the Franklin case-the looting of the Common­ wealth Savings Bank, in which I filed a claim on behalf of the Commonwealth victims. To my surprise and joy, I succeeded beyond all my expectations in this case-until a strained inter­ pretation of our state Constitution was put forward by Nebras­ ka's Supreme Court. First, I presented to the Claims Board the Commonwealth story exactly as described in this book, but with even more extensive documentation. The Claims Board agreed and reached a Settlement for some $16,000,000.00 to be paid to the Commonwealth victims. But, the Legislature had to approve this, as did the Governor. So, we took the matter of the settlement-with me as attorney for the Claimants and victims-to the State Legislature. Sur­ prise-in a close but bitter battle, enough Senators stood up to acknowledge the horrible acts that had occurred, and the 289"},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"• • • 290 • THE FRANKLIN COVER-UP intense suffering of the Commonwealth victims that resulted. The settlement was approved. Next, we went to the Governor, who signed the legislation for the settlement. Then, the matter was taken to court by certain unnamed individuals (concerned citizens), who claimed that they did not want their tax money used to pay these Commonwealth victims. Nebraska has a unique section in its State Constitution which forbids the state from using any tax dollars for purposes of extending the credit of the state or granting a gift. The result: that which the Claims Board, and the Legislature and the Governor all agreed the Commonwealth Savings Bank victims were entitled to because of the failures of the Govern­ ment in Commonwealth, was taken away by the Supreme Court of the State of Nebraska. The Court claimed that Nebraska's Constitution forbids paying the money to the victims, because they were only victims of moral wrongdoing, rather than le­ gal wrongdoing. And John DeCamp, who would have become a multi-mil­ lionaire out of the case because I had done it on a contingent fee basis, ended up with nothing but the certain knowledge that I had established the truth as I have written in this book with respect to Commonwealth Savings Bank and certain of the personalities who are today so prominent on the national scene-Senator Bobby Kerrey, for example. Besides Yorkshire TV, the most notable among the electronic media which became interested in the Franklin story was the TV program, America's Most Wanted (AMW). In several episodes, AMW opened up a whole new dimension on just how high up politically the story went and how wide it reached across the country. For a while, I had great hopes. For example, AMW inter­ viewed Paul Bonacci in prison and broadcast his account of a host of specific details about individuals, places, activities, kidnappings, etc., in which he said he had participated."},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"INVESTIGATION, AND COVER-UP, CONTINUE. To the shock of AMW (and sometimes, of myself), the inci­ dents Paul Bonacci described, when investigated by AMW, turned out to be exactly as Paul had recounted. For instance, a young boy named \"Jimmy\" who had been branded by pedophile perpetrators-like you would brand a steer with a hot iron-cautiously came forward to a nationally broadcast request by and verified many of the events Paul had described, including a secret hiding place for concealing children located in Colorado, precisely as Paul had said. Investigation by AMW in preparing subsequent episodes of the program, began turning over more and more rocks, provid­ ing still more proof of the story told by Alisha Owen and by the other victim-witnesses. AMW even featured a one-hour special on one of the most important kidnappings on which Bonacci had given details, that of Johnny Gosch, the Des Moines, Iowa, newspaper boy who had disappeared a dozen years ago. Gosch's parents, John and Noreen, had repeatedly met with Bonacci and become convinced of the truth of Paul's description of the kidnapping and of Paul's own participation in it. At a press conference reported in the World Herald April 7, 1992, John and Noreen Gosch had declared: \"Paul (Bonacci) told my wife and I things that we've never told anybody.\" The investigation was moving rapidly in the Franklin case, as proof poured in by the bucketful. Then, I received a call from AMW producer for the show, Paul Sparrow. \"We are going to slow it down a bit on the Franklin story,\" Sparrow told me, \"until you can get a break in the courts or get some responsible law enforcement to follow up some of the leads we have provided them. I don't know how to exactly say this, but I am beginning to understand what you are up against when it comes to certain law enforcement not wanting to pursue this story,\" Sparrow continued. \"What, exactly, do you mean?\" I asked him. \"Well,\" Sparrow continued, \"you must be aware of the fact that America's Most Wanted works extremely close with the FBI. In fact, without them we would not really be able to have a program. We really have never had any major disagreements in all our programming because we can't afford to.

But we are running into some severe problems on this Franklin thing. It is the first time that the FBI is refusing to cooperate.

As I told Paul several weeks later, \"You have done a tremen­ dous service for this country in the work you did on the Franklin case, on its nationwide links and on its drug dealing and political implications, and particularly, by proving so many of the things in question, including even arranging to have Paul Bonacci polygraphed by some of the nation's best experts to prove his truthfulness. I full well understand your sensitive situation and your relationship with the FBI and the problems this entire case causes for you, because the essence of Paul Bonacci and the children's claims is that the FBI, for whatever reasons, is refusing to do anything about this case and is itself part of the cover-up.\" I told Paul Sparrow that I accepted his definition of his duty: to provide an entertainment program to the American public; that requires the complete cooperation of the FBI, rather than an adversarial relationship. I have continued to maintain contact with Paul Sparrow and America's Most Wanted, and maintain the highest admiration for Paul and his work. But he has done his job. Now, it is up to myself and other Americans, and particularly law enforcement, who had the opportunity to see the America's Most Wanted programs, to do something about it. AMWhad turned up boatloads of new evidence on the Frank­ lin case, and on the kidnapping of Johnny Gosch. The FBI, in response to this new evidence, officially stated that Alisha Owen was a convicted liar, and that Paul Bonacci was a con­ victed child molester.

Still another revelation confirming the Franklin story sur­ faced with the apparent forced retirement of FBI head William Sessions in 1994. In Chapter 14, \"Cover-up Phase III: The FBI,\" I discussed the case of the African-American FBI agent Donald Rochon in Omaha. Rochon had alleged, in his lawsuit against the FBI, that, in addition to harassing him, FBI agents in the Omaha office were involved in all sorts of sexual perver­ sions, and these same agents were also \"investigating\" homo­ sexual prostitution rings involving Boys Town. As I had re­ ported, it was only a matter of time until Rochon discovered­ if he had not done so already-that his FBI tormentors were deeply involved in the Franklin affair itself. The FBI agreed to settle Rochon's suit by paying him $1 million, and to reim­ burse his legal expenses of $500,000. Later, in 1994, when the press was hounding Sessions as to what, if anything, he had done during his term as FBI Director, Judge Sessions defended himself by recalling his \"successful\" handling of the law suit of the former FBI agent Donald Rochon, which, he said, he had been able to settle, without it damaging the FBI. Sessions said that the horrible allegations Rochon had made in his lawsuit were in fact true, and that a public trial would have damaged the Bureau. He, Sessions, had prevented this disaster by settling out of court. . . . In Chapter 14, \"Cover-up Phase III: The FBI,\" I reported how, in October 1989, John Stevens Berry, counsel for the State Senate Franklin Committee grilled Omaha Police Chief Robert Wadman as to why the Omaha Police Department was dismissing the reports by child victim-witnesses of horrific abuse, and of other crimes. Wadman replied: \"The FBI ... conducts an investigation and basically says 293"},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"294 • THE FRANKLIN COVER-UP the same things that we have said. If the FBI, are they now linked to this cover-up in some way? Should the Justice Depart­ ment be investigated as somehow or another assisting in this 'cover-up' ?\" I noted, apropos of this exchange, that, \"Wadman said it, but in this case it's true. The Justice Department, acting through the FBI and the U.S. Attorney's Office in Omaha, emerges from the record of the Franklin investigations not so much as a party to the cover-up, but as its coordinator.\" Now, four years later, I am even more certain of these charges. Not only has information continued to pour in on the Franklin case which strengthens me in that conviction, and not only has the Justice Department turned its back on a high-level request to re-examine the whole Franklin case (see Chapter 25), but, in case after notorious case entirely unrelated to Franklin, Justice Department personnel appear as liars, perverts, frame­ up artists, and even-assassins. An increasing number of citizens view the United States government with suspicion, even hatred. Though there are no doubt other branches of the government where corruption flourishes, there is no question in my mind that the stench of evil which emanates from Washington, originates in the so­ called Department of Justice, particularly in its permanent bu­ reaucracy. I have documented that case with respect to the Franklin cover-up, and the average citizen may have become aware of it in the massacre at Ruby Ridge, Idaho, in August 1992, where it is now generally acknowledged that the Justice Department, through its FBI marksmen, murdered the 14-year­ old son and wife of Randy Weaver. The same thing happened in Waco, Texas in 1993, when the Justice Department directed the slaughter of 86 people, based on false reports from \"infor­ mants\" out of Melbourne, Australia, associated with the Anti­ Defamation League of B'nai B'rith. I will note here, several other cases in which that same hideous corruption is apparent, and then describe at length, in Chapter 24 how the U.S. Justice Department on June 3, 1983, killed in cold blood midwestern farm activist Gordon Kahl, whose son is now my client."},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"INVESTIGATION, AND COVER-UP, CONTINUE • THE LAROUCHE CASE I think by now, although the major news media alternately blacks him out, or slanders him, most people in the country know something about the economist and several-time Demo­ cratic Party presidential candidate, Lyndon H. LaRouche, Jr. After all, he did get a very respectable 600,000 votes in the Democratic presidential primaries in 1996, averaging 10% or more of the vote in each state in which he ran. And, while people may have heard that he is a \"convicted felon,\" they probably have no idea of what actually happened. On December 16, 1988, Lyndon H. LaRouche, Jr. and six co-defendants were convicted on one count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud, eleven counts of mail fraud, in the alleged amount of $294,000 in unrepaid loans; LaRouche was con­ victed on one additional charge, of attempting to defraud the Internal Revenue Service. LaRouche was then 66 years old; it was obvious that the very harsh sentence of 15 years he was given, meant that the Justice Department intended for him to die in jail. In 1991, I first had a chance to examine a small portion of the six volumes of evidence his attorneys filed with the court, proving his innocence. I must say, notwithstanding all that I had already been through on the Franklin case, I was shocked-no, \"stunned\" is a better word-by what I read. I remember saying to colleagues at the time, \"Oh, my God, if they can do this to LaRouche, who is a well-known, if controversial, political figure, in this blatant way, there is no one in the country that they won't simply frame up.\" The U.S. Justice Department had not a shadow of \"evidence\" to convict LaRouche, nor any of his associates, one of whom, Michael Billington, was sent to jail in Virginia for 77 years! In fact, the evidence showed-in the government's own docu­ ments released under the Freedom of Information Act-as LaRouche's attorneys contended, that \"The U.S. government knew at all relevant times, from 1979 to the present day, that Lyndon LaRouche and his co-defendants were innocent of the false charges for which they were convicted.\" The only crimes committed in the \"LaRouche case\" were the massive illegalities 295"},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"296 • THE FRANKLIN COVER-UP of the U.S. Department of Justice in their zeal to remove LaRouche from the political life of this country. It later turned out, as LaRouche's associates found out from FOIA appeals, that LaRouche's latest troubles started when his longtime political enemy, Henry Kissinger, wrote a letter in 1982 to then-FBI director William Webster, asking Webster to go after LaRouche. But, already back in 1973, as other FOIA documents from the FBI's own files showed, the FBI had authorized the Communist Party of the United States (which it basically ran, through its \"informants\") to \"eliminate\" LaRouche-that is, to kill him outright. I was not the only one to get a whiff of a big-time frame­ up. Former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark, with whom I had had some contact during the Franklin case, and who was LaRouche's appeals lawyer, wrote a letter to Attorney General Janet Reno, in which he said, \"I believe it [the LaRouche case] involves a broader range of deliberate and systematic misconduct and abuse of power over a longer period of time in an effort to destroy a political movement and leader, than any other federal prosecution in my time or to my knowledge.\" And, as of August 1996, 721 U.S. state legislators (and thousands more federal parliamentarians and other dignitaries around the world) had signed an open letter calling for the exoneration of LaRouche which denounced, in no uncertain terms, his frame-up. LaRouche is out of jail, and going strong, but he has still not been exonerated from the stain of a phony conviction, nor compensated for the five years stolen from his life, nor for the untold damage done to his political movement. THE DEMJANJUK CASE A case which almost rivals that of LaRouche, in terms of the length to which the Justice Department will go to crush one individual, is that of former Cleveland autoworker John Demjanjuk. In 1979, the Justice Department accused Demjanjuk of being the notorious \"Ivan the Terrible,\" the Nazi mass-murderer who"},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"INVESTIGATION, AND COVER·UP, CONTINUE • killed countless Jews at the Treblinka concentration camp in Poland. Demjanjuk's lawyers later proved-again, from the Justice Department's own documents-that the department knew, almost from the very beginning, that Ivan the Terrible had already been proven to be someone other than Demjanjuk. Still other documents showed that the Justice Department knowingly accepted a forged J.D. card from the Soviet intelli­ gence agency, the KGB, to frame Demjanjuk. Finally, with the full knowledge that he was innocent, the Department of Justice had Demjanjuk extradited to Israel to be executed. It was only due to the extraordinary courage and tenacity of his Israeli lawyer, Yoram Sheftel, that the Cleveland autoworker was finally acquitted. Then, on November 17, 1993, the U.S. Sixth Court of Appeals in Cincinnati, Ohio, issued a stinging rebuke to the Department of Justice, in an 83-page decision overturning Demjanjuk's denaturalization. The Court charged that the Department had committed \"prosecutorial mis­ conduct\" and \"fraud upon the court,\" in obtaining the con­ viction. Nothwithstanding all that, the Justice Department is trying to have Demjanjuk extradited from the United States! THE FRUEHMENSCHEN CAS E On January 27, 1988, then-Congressman Mervyn Dymally placed before the House of Representatives a shocking document. It was an affidavit sworn by an FBI agent, Hirsch Friedman, concerning an FBI policy named Operation Fruehmenschen (German for \"primitive man\"). According to Friedman's testimony, \"The purpose of this policy was the routine investigation without probable cause of prominent elected and appointed officials in major metropolitan areas throughout the United States. It was explained to me that the basis for this Fruehmenschen policy was the assumption by the FBI that black officials were intellectually and socially incapable of governing major governmental organizations and institutions.\" 297"},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"298 • THE FRANKLIN COVER·UP Other evidence backed up Friedman's charges, including a 1987 book by Dr. Mary Sawyer, Harassment of Black Elected Officials: Ten Years Later, a follow-up to a 1977 report she had issued on the same subject. The figures backed up Dymally and Sawyer's charges. Be­ tween 1983 and 1988, 14% of all political corruption cases targetted black officials, though they comprised only 3% of U.S. officeholders. From 1981-1983, roughly half of the 26 members of the Congressional Black Caucus were targets of federal investigation for indictments. In magnitude, this is as if 204 members of the (largely white) 435-member House of Representatives were under investigation at anyone time! On this overall Justice Department corruption, I was very heartened to see a resolution from the National Black Caucus of State Legislators (NBCSL), which they had passed at their 19th Annual Legislative Conference, held in Birmingham, Ala­ bama, from November 28 to December 2, 1995. The resolution referred to the two-day hearings which the Schiller Institute had sponsored in Virginia on August 31 and September 1, where a distinguished panel of legislators and international legal experts (including prominent members of the NBCSL) came together to examine Department of Justice corruption regarding the above cases and others. The NBCSL said, in its \"Resolution 20: A Call For Congressional Hearings To Investigate Misconduct by the U.S. Department of Justice\": \"WHEREAS, the hearings focussed on cases where there was evidence of political targeting of groups and individuals by corrupt officials inside federal governmental law enforcement agencies, working in tandem with a concert of private organizations ... \"WHEREAS, the evidence was presented, not by the good word of the witnesses alone, but documented by the govern­ ment's own documents, records, and memoranda, first sup­ pressed and later obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, and other legal actions, \"BE IT RESOLVED ...

So now, four years later, what has happened to some of the key figures in the Franklin case? My good friend, William Colby, the chief behind-the-scenes architect of the Franklin investigation, is dead. Franklin Credit Union boss Larry King has served five years in prison and is about to be released. Alisha Owen was convicted of perjury on June 21, 1991. In February, she went to prison to begin a IS-year sentence. This is notwithstanding the fact that the Nebraska Supreme Court expunged the report of the Douglas County Grand Jury from all official records, because the report violated all laws relating to such proceedings. This Grand Jury had indicted Alisha in the first place, claiming that the children's charges of abuse were a \"carefully crafted hoax.\" The Omaha World Herald, however, had extolled the Douglas County Grand Jury report, complaining that the Supreme Court had condemned it. At my own expense, I have continued to provide legal assis­ tance to her in the appeals process during the last four years. But, I did not represent Alisha at her original, hasty 30-day trial, and the problem in defending her subsequently is, that if things were done wrong at the trial level, either by the defen­ dant, or by the defendant's lawyer, it is difficult, if not impossi­ ble, to correct that problem at the appeals level. The only way to do that, is to prove to the court that the defendant did not receive adequate assistance by counsel during the trial­"},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"YEARS LATER-WHERE ARE THEY NOW? • otherwise the appeals attorney is limited to the record created during the original trial. Troy Boner came under such onerous pressure from the FBI, that he recanted all that he had told the State Senate's Franklin investigator, Gary Caradori. This recantation was the key factor in the Douglas Grand Jury's \"findings\" that all the children had lied. In 1993, Troy engaged me as his lawyer. Before he did so, however, I asked him to write an affidavit, telling the story as he actually knew it to have actually happened. In this affidavit (printed in the next chapter), he reasserted his original story, which he had also told the Yorkshire TV crew. He has now dropped from sight, no doubt terrified about the threats that the FBI and others delivered to him, were he to tell the truth. Paul Bonacci has matured, fallen in love, and is a devoutly religious young man. He is now a youth counselor, working to protect young children from the experiences he suffered. The civil rights lawsuit I filed on behalf of Paul still contin­ ues. It has been an incredibly costly and painful effort for both of us. I will try to outline a few of the facts which are on the public record with respect to that lawsuit. First, as part of our discovery process in the suit, we were able to locate a vast store of pornographic materials, which were in the possession of the Douglas County Court. These had been held by Peter Citron before Citron was arrested. However, the court imposed such strict rules on our being allowed to see the material, that we were able to review only I % of the material-before the court ordered it destroyed! The material consisted of thousands of hours of tapes, maga­ zine articles, and related pornographic materials. The court ruled that Paul was not to be allowed to see any of the materials. This restriction was extremely damaging to us, because Paul was and is the one person who can, and will, identify the children and the others in the films-a fact the court itself acknowledged! The more we began to pour over Citron's materials, the more we discovered that huge amounts of them, as identified in the official court inventory provided to us, were missing. So, we immediately went to court-which took additional time-to 301"},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"302 • THE FRANKLIN COVER-UP hold hearings and to subpoena officials, to try to locate the missing materials and find out how these materials could disap­ pear, despite strenuous security measures. The official in control of the materials simply declaimed: \"We admit there are huge amounts of pornographic materials missing, but we are not the ones who hid or destroyed or took them, and we do not know who did.\" Additionally, I could only view the materials in the presence of guards and of the Clerk of the Federal Court, at his conve­ nience, and behind security doors, and with notice given to all other attorneys in the case to be present if they so desired. All this security was, as I was told, for the protection of the pornographers involved-which seems strange, even in this bizarre case. Under the terms and within the time frame the court allowed, it was impossible to ever look at more than a fraction of the materials. Now, incredibly, the court has ordered the materials de­ stroyed. Arrayed against me in this civil rights lawsuit on behalf of Paul Bonacci are lawyers from across the United States, from a dozen or so of the highest priced law firms in the country. One of them is Ed Warin, a former United States Attorney from Nebraska during the time much of the Franklin matters were occurring, who represents Alan Baer. The reality I, and particularly Paul Bonacci, must face in this lawsuit is this: These defendants have unlimited money, power, and resources. Paul has no resources and I have limited time and resources and a family to support and a living to earn. For example, take the Deposition of Paul Bonacci, which was given in nine days spread out over the period of a year. I have often told Paul, after the deposition and the legal assault on his credibility by the battery of high-priced lawyers assem­ bled against him: \"Paul, there was truly an angel on your shoulder during these continuing days of depositions. I do not know of a single person who could have stood up to the questioning that you were put through and survived. If I had any doubts about your"},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"YEARS LATER-WHERE ARE THEY NOW? story before the depositions, I absolutely have no doubts now that you were and are telling the truth, and are possibly the single most important person in America who can document some horrible acts by some of our top government officials and government agencies. And though your particular case may not produce anything financial for you, the information you have laid out will one day be the starting point for major investigations of certain government agencies and their prac­ tices which have been concealed from the American people. You Paul Bonacci, are the living history book, for example, for a program called 'Monarch' and someday the American people must and will have access to that story.\" The more than 2,000 pages of questioning of Paul Bonacci are today secret. Matters only hinted at in this book are devel­ oped in detail there. Senator Loran Schmit was, as chairman of the State Legisla­ ture's special committee investigating Franklin, a pillar of cour­ age, without whom little or none of the truth would ever have emerged. The forces involved in the Franklin cover-up made sure he lost his 1992 race for the Senate, after having served for 24 years. They also bankrupted him through phony lawsuits. With my help, he defeated all these legal assaults, but the suits, along with the incessant attacks by the World Herald, took a toll. Senator Schmit now works as a consultant in Lincoln. Alan Baer paid a fortune to his attorneys and managed to get his charge reduced from felonies to a single misdemeanor for which he had to pay a $500 fine. Alan Baer has now become the major promoter for the gambling industry in Nebraska. In 1996, Baer and gambling syndicate supporters spent millions of dollars to win a position on the ballot for a proposal that would have given the gambling syndicates power to allow any type of casinos or gambling enterprises into the state that they would choose; and power to regulate the new casino operations. As two former state senators, Loran Schmit and myself took out full-page ads in the World Herald denouncing the plan, and attacked Baer by name. On Friday, October 25, 1996, the gambling syndicates had made arrangements to appear before Federal Judge Kopf, who 303"},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"304 • THE FRANKLIN COVER·UP had sentenced Larry King, to obtain a federal court order to place the gambling referendum on the ballot November 5, 1996. Only a week before, I had put out a press release in which I publicly expressed my fear that the gambling syndicates would be successful in getting their proposal on the ballot, since many of the personalities involved in the syndicate, had also been involved, and protected, in the Franklin case. The release may be one reason why, when on Oct. 25, the syndicate went to get its expected order from Judge Kopf, he was nowhere to be found! It turns out he had checked himself into Bryan Memorial Hospital, with what was claimed to be a possible heart attack. When all deadlines for signing the order had passed, Judge Kopf remarkably recovered and was released from the hospital to resume his duties on the bench. U.S. Federal Magistrate Richard G. KopJ, as predicted in the first edition, leapfrogged ahead of others to win appointment as a federal judge by President George Bush, shortly after Kopf's sentencing of Larry King. U.S. Assistant Attorney Thomas D. Thalken, the federal pros­ ecutor on top of the Franklin case, who had himself been named by investigator Gary Caradori's informants as being involved in pornography, moved ahead of five other candidates, to be appointed in October 1992 to replace Kopf as the new U.S. Federal Magistrate. Gerald Moran, Douglas County Prosecutor, also moved ahead of a host of others and was appointed a District Judge in Douglas County. His assistant, Robert Sigler, who had been described by Paul Bonacci as being in the middle ofthe Franklin affair, took over Moran's job of prosecuting Franklin-related victim-witnesses, particularly Alisha Owen. Omaha FBI head Nick O'Hara, who, as the saying went in Omaha, was closer to Omaha Police Chief Bob Wadman than \"nineteen is to twenty,\" moved to Washington to become the head of Counter-Terrorism for the FBI, and then onto Minne­ sota, to head up the state's Commission on Crime."},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"• • • CHAPTER 20 TROY BONER STEPS FORWARD Under immense pressure from the F.B.I., Troy Boner recanted the testimony he had provided Gary Caradori, about the crimi­ nal activities of some of Omaha's elite citizens.

His story was recorded in an affidavit he swore before a notary public on October 27, 1993. This affidavit is printed in full below.

I, and my mother and family, are ex­ hausted from living in fear of death or injury as a result of my personal involvement in the Franklin matters which ended up in my testifying at the Grand Jury hearings as well as at the Alisha Owen Trial. I lied at the Grand Jury hearings and I lied at the Alisha Owen trial. I lied when I \"recanted\" my original testimony to Gary Caradori. I lied because I truly believed and still do believe that it was a situation where I must either \"lie or die,\" and at the insistence primarily of the Federal Bureau of Investigation officials who were dealing with me at that time, specifically Mr. Mott and Mr. Culver. The purpose of this affidavit, very simply, is to provide John De Camp the information he requires to file an action seeking protection for me and for my family from various individuals and the F.B.I. so that my true story can be told without fear of death or injury to myself or my family and so that others in a similar situation to myself can also come forward safely and tell their stories which I believe will prove very clearly that what I am saying in this affidavit is true. I am also certain now that only by telling the truth as openly and publicly as I can will I ever stand a chance of providing protection for myself and my family for the future. I have asked John De Camp to do whatever is necessary to seek Witness Protection, including Federal Witness Protection if possible, for myself and my mother and my pregnant fiancee and child-to-be. Yes, I know full well the very great risk I run by taking this action but I and my mother and family can not go on the way we are and I can not live with myself unless I take this action.

So he has told me. The exact opposite is true. Never have I spoken with John De Camp prior to this and he has never contacted me directly or indirectly. I had a friend of mine contact John De Camp several weeks ago and bring him to a meeting with me and my family at a secret location. At the time, John De Camp did not even know he was coming to meet me or my family. He thought he was being brought to meet a girl who needed representation on some matter. I searched him before our meet­ ing began. We both agreed-with my entire family present­ that anything said at the meeting could not and would not be recorded or ever used against me or to hurt me by John De Camp if I did not want to go ahead with this action. He agreed. I proceeded, along with my mother, to detail for John De Camp the fact that I had lied; why I had no choice but to lie; and many other facts. I then asked John De Camp whether he would represent me in helping to correct matters. I told him I went to him not because I liked him or knew him but because I felt he was the only honest one in this entire mess who could and would do something about my situation and who would not back down when the going got tough and who would \"stick by me thru thick and thin if I (Troy) was telling the truth absolutely.\" He promised to do this so long as I told the truth and would agree to comply with any lie detector or other truth test he or any legitimate investigative officials might ask for no matter what and so long as I and my family were doing this action not for money damages but for our safety and to get the truth told and myself and my mother and other kids protected.

After researching and investi­ gating what I, Troy Boner, had told him, De Camp said he would represent me and my family on a Pro Bono basis seeking only such compensation for representation as a Court might provide him. He also agreed to assist in any way he could personally in helping procure a secure and safe environment for me and my fiancee and child-to-be and to procure such other assistance for us as was possible thru social agencies or other groups or government agencies able to assist me and my family. He specifically refused in advance to provide any personal financial assistance in any way saying that he felt that would raise questions as to the correctness of his work on this case. I have included this information in this affidavit at his, De Camp's, request, to answer in advance questions he said others would ask. MY ORIGINAL STORY TO GARY CARADORI: What I told Gary Caradori in the original taped interviews Gary had with me was the truth. It is still the truth. From about age 14 to 17 I was seriously involved in sexual and drug and related activities with a wide range of individuals but primarily and specifically Alan Baer, Larry King, Robert Wadman, Peter Citron, Eugene Mahoney, and others of prominence and wealth whom I will identify for any legitimate investigative officials who seriously wish to correct the problems and stop the conduct these individuals are and were engaged in rather than cover up that conduct. It has been repeatedly publicly stated that my story and the stories told by Alisha Owen, Paul Bonacci, and a large number of other young people not previously identified who were simply intimidated from talking or who were ridiculed, were a \"Care­ fully Crafted Hoax.\" The stories were not a hoax. The only"},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":"TROY BONER STEPS FORWARD • carefully crafted thing that occurred was in fact the cover-up of the facts and the subsequent conviction of Alisha Owen and the original Grand Jury Investigation. In short, there was a carefully crafted cover-up by the very people who were sup­ posed to be exposing the conduct of these people rather than covering it up. And, yes, I was a very, very critical element in that cover-up but that participation by me was done because of threat and promise made to me primarily from the F.B.I.. and Mr. Mark Delman, the attorney arranged for me by others. I repeat. The original story I told on taped interview to Gary Caradori was in fact substantially the truth and substantially accurate. I say substantially because I am sure on some points I exaggerated and on some points I did not remember exactly the date or place or time of this or that event or particular person or persons involved. But, specifically, the material and substantive facts about the (1) Parties that took place at Twin Towers; (2) the use of myself and other children as drug couri­ for Alan Baer and Larry King; (3) the involvement of Alisha Owen at the parties and as a drug courier also and her involvement with former Omaha Police Chief Robert Wadman; (4) my relationship with Alan Baer sexually and otherwise as well as the involvement of a number of other children with him; (5) Wadman's presence and participation at these parties in question; (6) my delivering Alisha Owen personally to Bob Wadman on several occasions; (7) my involvement sexually as a boy with Eugene Mahoney, the former Game and Parks man; (8) Peter Citron's presence and involvement in the parties and related sexual activities and filmings, were all true, correct and accurate on the material facts. And, contrary to what the F.B.I. and others tried to get me to say and what I did say and in saying did lie about under pressure and threat and promise from the F.B.I. and others, Gary Caradori did not intimidate, threaten, coach, make up things or in any way improperly or falsely portray the information I provided him. He simply asked me to tell the truth, no matter what it was, and that is essentially what I did with him. He told me that was the law; that I had to report these things about Child Abuse under the state laws. But that was the only pressure of any kind he applied. And I 309"},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"310 • THE FRANKLIN COVER-UP know now it is the state law and all I want to do is comply with that law without fear of me or my family being hurt or killed for having complied with that law. MY CONTACT WITH THE F. B. I. AND WHY I LIE 0 AFTER THAT CONTACT: After telling my story to Gary Caradori, I was assured that it was most important that everything I knew be kept absolutely secret. That I should talk to no-one or reveal what I had provided Caradori or the Legislative Committee. Everybody, including Caradori and the Committee and the Feds told me this. I know now that this was the stupidest thing I could do and that my following their very instructions to conceal things in fact made me and my family subject to and victims of later threats and intimidation. That is one of the main reasons that I have defi­ nitely determined that I will now conceal nothing from any legitimate investigative source-including the press. I am cer­ tain that had the press really known what was happening and all the facts that they would have done a far better investigation than others and would not have allowed the cover-up to occur. I will explain later why I now believe this to be the case. In my first contact with the F.B.I., the F.B.I. officials, particu­ larly Mickey Mott and Mr. Culver, made it clear to me that (1) They were only interested in disproving everything I had told them; that (2) they were taking the position that \" ... we know you are lying and we are only trying to figure out why and who is your leader who is having you lie\"; and that (3) \"if you will tell us you are lying then we will let you off the hook but if you insist on sticking with the story you told Caradori, then we will stick you in prison for a long, long time. What you told on your tapes to Caradori can land you in prison for twenty years each on a lot of different charges of perjury. If you insist on sticking with your story, you will go down.\" When the F.B.I. dealt with me, they made it clear that they had the power to put me in prison-whether my story to Cara­"},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":"TROY BONER STEPS FORWARD • dori was true or not-and the power to put Caradori and others in prison including Alisha for providing the information we did to Caradori. And they made it clear that was what they intended to do unless I \"recanted\" my original story to Caradori and the Legislative Committee. The F.B.I. in conjunction with my new attorney, Marc Del­ man, who was arranged for me by others including particularly Frank Brown of the Television Station in Omaha, made it crystal clear to me that my only hope of staying out of prison was in \"recanting\" my original story to Gary Caradori, even though my story to Caradori was and is the truth. To make a long story short, I was put into the following situation by the F.B.I. and my attorney, Marc Delman, and I am confident in my own mind that they knew exactly what they were doing although I still do not understand all the reasons why they wanted me to lie or who they were doing this for: I had to lie to stay out of prison and I had to say that the truth was a lie and that the lies they wanted me to tell were the truth. So, when I went before the Grand Jury, at the insistence and instruction of Marc Delman and the F.B.I., I told the Grand Jury what the F.B.I. and Delman wanted me to tell the Grand Jury which is that the story to Gary Caradori was a \"hoax.\" But, as stated, the exact opposite is true. Some time after my testimony to the Grand Jury, Gary Caradori was killed. I have no proof but I do believe he was deliberately killed. But, someone else will have to determine this because I acknowledge I have no information to prove or disprove this. Immediately after Gary Caradori was killed, and because I did believe he had been killed as part of a cover­ up and as a result of my lies to the grand jury, I immediately called his home (from the Red Lion Hotel) at which time I spoke to his wife Sandie and told her I had in fact lied to the Grand Jury and that I was going to help straighten it out now. She suggested I go to Senator Schmit and provide him that information. This I immediately did and told Senator Schmit personally in his office that I had lied to the Grand Jury and that what I told Gary Caradori was the truth and that I only lied out of fear that the F.B.I. and others, particularly my 311"},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"312 • THE FRANKLIN COVER·UP attorney Marc Delman, would hurt me or my family and particu­ larly because they promised me they would put me in jail if I did not say what the F.B.I. and Delman wanted me to say which I, and I am sure they also knew was a lie. I also met Senator Bernice Labedz at the Caradori funeral and agreed I would meet her and Senator Schmit for lunch immediately following the funeral at which time we would go over my alleged \"recantation\" and I would provide her and the Committee all the facts. At the funeral, however, the F.B.I. agents, particularly Mickey Mott made it clear to me thru their actions that they knew what I was up to and gave me the clear impression that I was in \"great danger\" if I went ahead and met with the Legislative Committee and tried to tell them the truth. So, immediately following the funeral, I told my mother, who was with me, that we were not going to the meeting with the Senators and I was going to stick with my lies to the Grand Jury because of what I feared the F.B.I. or others associated with them or whom they were protecting would do to me or the members of my family. Later, Senator Labedz called me and asked why I did not show up at the meeting. At first I pretended like I did not know what she was talking about because by this time I was really scared especially because of Caradori's death. Then she said she knew I was scared. So I was honest and I remember I flat told her I was \"scared\" and could not do anything now. She said she felt sorry for me and that she understood. Then, Marc Delman and Mickey Mott saw Senator Schmit say on T.V. that I had been in his, Schmit's office, and that my \"recantation\" had been false. They both called me. Even though Marc Delman knew I had been at Schmit's office and that what Schmit was saying was the truth, he, Delman, asked me whether the conversation had been taped or whether there was any other record of my having been in Schmit's office to talk to Schmit. I told Delman there was no tape or any other record I had been with Schmit & that I had not signed anything. So, acting on Delman's instructions I publicly lied and denied any meeting or discussion with Senator Schmit and Delman publicly did the same and suggested Senator Schmit was lying."},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"TROY BONER STEPS FORWARD • Delman then instructed me to deny that I was in Schmit's office and to simply imply that Schmit was lying about all these things. Delman's exact words to me were, \"It's your word against his ... as long as there are no tapes.\" Mickey Mott the F.B.I. man also met again with me and again made it clear that if I told the truth-in other words, if I recanted my recanta­ tion-that I was in big trouble and would go to prison and for the first time Mickey Mott said something I interpreted then and now to have been a direct and personal threat that later came to pass. When I told Mickey Mott and Culver the F.B.I. people one time when I was feeling a bit cocky about their threats to me that Alan Baer and others \"could n01 afford\" to do anything to hurt me now because too much publicity was focused on me and that they could not afford the risk of doing anything to me, Mott right away told me that they probably would not do anything directly to me, that instead \"they will do something to a family member.\" And, of course that is what happened shortly thereafter after I had met with Schmit and talked to Sandie Caradori and when the F.B.I. and Delman and Baer and others thought I might break away from them, the F.B.I. and Delman, and tell the truth and confirm that I had lied when I testified to the Grand Jury. I am completely certain in my own mind, which I believe a decent and honest investigation will show, that my brother Shawn was killed as a message to me to stick with my lies and not to back down because they were afraid I might back down and tell the truth at the Alisha Owen trial. After Shawn got killed, I had no doubt at all that they really were as dangerous as I had originally feared; that they would do anything and kill anybody to keep the truth contained and to keep me lying for them; and I complied with every request they wanted me to do or say with respect to the whole so called Franklin thing. Before the Alisha Owen trial I was carefully rehearsed by the F.B.I. as to what I would say and what questions would be asked and then after rehearsing everything with the F.B.I., I was taken over to Mr. Moran the prosecutor to go thru the Rehearsal again. I do not know whether Mr. Moran knew I 313"},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"314 • THE FRANKLIN COVER·UP was lying but for sure the F.B.I. had to know because they were the ones who forced me to \"recant\" in the first place and threatened me with prison if I did not. Additionally, the F.B.I. themselves had actual pictures of me and other prominent individuals in their possession including particularly Alan Baer (1983 picture of he and me in very pornographic sexual acts) as well as checks from Alan Baer to me. So, they had to absolutely know I had a relationship with him and that they were forcing me to lie when I denied such relationships. Addi­ tionally, the F.B.I. had seized photos and tapes involving among others myself and a Mr. Andreasen and Larry King. These were video tapes of a party. And I know from having seen tapes at Peter Citron's house that the F.B.I. had access to tapes which clearly documented much of the conduct and the personalities I and other kids had identified as having occurred but which later I lied about before the Grand Jury and again at the Alisha Owen trial when I claimed-again to satisfy the F.B.I. -that the events never occurred. I do not know what the F.B.I. ever did with these pictures of me and Baer, for example, but I know they had them because I saw them. So, they, the F.B.I. had to know the real truth all along and had to know what they were doing when they forced me to lie. I am also sure that there are other pictures which would prove the things we kids told Caradori. Why do I say this? Because, the one thing I remember above all else is that these people like Baer, Mahoney, Citron, Andreasen, King, always loved to have pictures of themselves and others, particularly the kids, in weird sexual poses. MY CREDIBILITY AND THE CREDIBILITY OF THE OTHER KIDS: I know the first thing that the F.B.I. and Marc Delman and others involved in these Franklin and related matters will say when I submit my affidavit is something like: \"You can't believe these kids and you can't believe Troy Boner now. If"},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"TROY BONER STEPS FORWARD • he lied once, he will lie again. He's a drug addict. He's a sex pervert. Who are you going to believe, these kids with their wild stories or respectable people like Alan Baer or the F.B.I. or Attorney Marc Delman? Besides, these kids were as guilty or more guilty than anybody else. They were using the drugs and they were selling their bodies and they were getting paid well for it and they did it all voluntarily.\" Or something like this is what they will say. I have heard it before. But, let me give the other side of that story. Yes, we kids, from early age, sold our bodies. We became drug addicts. We got lots and lots of money from these people. But today we are ruined because of that. And we were turned into sex perverts and drug addicts by these people. In my particular case, just like a lot of other young boys, I was directly turned into a true drug addict by Alan Baer. He was the one who first taught me to mainline and who first directly injected heroin directly into my veins-same as he did to a lot of other boys. He was the one who made me a prisoner of drug addiction to where he could completely control me and use me to deliver drugs or deliver sex or anything else. Sure, he paid me well, but he also destroyed me in the process. It was Alan Baer who first injected me with a \"speed ball\", for example. A speed ball is a heroin/cocaine mix that zips you up immediately but brings you down mellow. And it was Marc Delman, my attorney arranged for me by others who claimed lowed him more than $500,000.00 for work he did protecting me, when what he really was doing was having me lie to protect others. But to those who really want the truth it really is all there for you to find out if you will only check on the things that are available. And the truth is the truth whether it is told by us street kids whom you may not want to believe or the richest and most powerful people in Omaha who you think you have to believe. Same with a lie. So, here are some things that any honest investigator can check out to see who is lying and who is telling the truth. I. Marc Delman wrote my script for the [TV] program 48 Hours wherein I claimed that the entire story of myself and the other kids was a \"hoax.\" He promised me ten or fifteen 31S"},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"316 • THE FRANKLIN COVER·UP thousand [dollars] for this. I got virtually nothing. 48 Hours told me that they had \"paid my attorney.\" There should be records on this. I think Marc got about $10,500.00 for doing that. And as everyone knows, the 48 Hours program was played on television just before the Alisha Owen jury began their deliberations. Marc Delman also claimed that I had not met with Senator Schmit to tell the truth and I followed his instructions in denying it also. This sure can be checked out. There were people who saw me with Schmit. Same with my contact with Senator Labedz. II. I saw the picture the F.B.I. had of me and Alan Baer. Some official sure ought to be able to get this picture to prove who is lying-me or the F.B.I. III. Lots of kids, other than myself and Alisha and the ones who tried to come forward and tell the truth, know about Alan Baer, Larry King and the major drug dealing activity they and other prominent people were involved in. But, as long as they are scared for their lives because of what happened to Alisha and me, they are not going to say anything. If an honest prosecu­ tor would step in and offer immunity and protection to these kids, many of them young men and women now, I am sure the entire network of drug dealing, use of kids for sex, and related things could be proven and corroborated to every­ body's satisfaction. IV. But, maybe the most important thing that any honest investigator should do is to ask me, Troy Boner, or any of the other kids such as Alisha or Paul Bonacci, to take polygraph, lie detector, tests side by side on the same questions with the people we are accusing of these things. Example, ask Alan Baer if he shot mainline drugs into me and if he is a major drug dealer and if he had sex with me. Ask Eugene Mahoney if he met me at the book store in Council Bluffs and used to regularly pay me to have sex with him as a boy? Ask [ ... ] to take a polygraph test on whether he is a big-time drug dealer. Ask the F.B.I. guys to take a polygraph test on whether they threatened me with jail if I did not say the things they wanted me to say which things were a lie. Ask Marc Delman about the 48 Hours thing and the Schmit meeting."},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"TROY BONER STEPS FORWARD • Obviously, either us kids are lying or the rich prominent people are lying. And just because they are rich and prominent does not mean they are telling the truth or because we are thought of as scum and kids who were supposedly all willingly involved in the drug trafficking and sexual activity does not mean we are lying. And like it or not, if we are not worth protecting then other young kids now and in the future will not be worth protecting either; and the prominent and respectable citizens who took us as children and made us a part of this drug dealing and sex abuse activity will continue without fear to do the same. Maybe to your children next time. I promised my mother and myself after my lying at Alisha Owen's trial caused her to get convicted that if I ever got the chance to straighten things out I would come forward and do it and set the record straight. I owe it to my brother Shawn. A couple months ago I met investigators from a British Television Broadcasting Company. They convinced me that they honestly wanted to tell the true story no matter what that story was. I believed after talking with them that my and my family's safety lies in telling everything particularly to press sources outside Nebraska and not controlled by Nebraskans. I have done this in many hours of tapes with them. They have checked on many of the matters I told them about-not dealt with in this affidavit- and have satisfied themselves that I am telling the truth about my lying to the Grand Jury and to convict Alisha Owen and the reasons why I had to lie, just as I have explained in this affidavit. The reason I mention this is simply to establish that eliminating me or any member of my family will do nothing to suppress the information or keep me from reporting it because I have already done so in many hours of tapes which have been taken outside this country but which will be made available to Federal Authorities and legitimate investigators here and in Washington, D.C. But right now, I need protection for myself and my family so that I can tell the truth totally and without fear of being punished or jailed for doing it. That is the purpose of this affidavit.

I tried to tell the truth to the F.B.I. and Marc Delman but they did not want to hear the truth and the only thing they wanted was to have me say the truth was in fact a hoax; and they scared me with threats of jail and other things into lying to the Grand Jury and then later into lying for them at the Alisha Owen Trial.

Based upon recently declassified government documents, eyewitness reports, and court records, Mercury reporter Gary Webb provided a detailed account of how the Contras financed their war against the Sandinista regime of Nicaragua by flying tons of cocaine into the West Coast, where it would be turned into the deadly, instantly addictive \"crack,\" and sold to such street gangs as the Cryps and the Bloods. All of this began after the U.S. Congress in the early 1980s passed the Boland Amendment, which stopped all official fi­ nancing for U.S. intelligence's \"covert war\" in Nicaragua. The whole project was taken \"off-line,\" and financed by drug sales-the subject of Webb's articles. Indignation exploded when the Mercury series hit the streets. Maxine Waters, Congresswoman for South-Central Los Angeles, one of the areas hardest hit by crack and drug-related violence, sent a letter to Central Intelligence Agency chief John Deutsch demanding an investigation of the Agency, in which she said, \"As someone who has seen how the crack cocaine trade has devastated the South-Central Los Angeles commu­ nity, I cannot exaggerate my feelings of dismay that my own government may have played a part in the origins and history of this problem. . . .

We all have an obligation to get to the very bottom of the origin, development, and implementation of this seedy enterprise.\" While many were shocked at the news of apparent U.S. government drug-pushing, to me it was one more confirmation of a key aspect of the Franklin case. As I had discovered early on (as had Gary Caradori), the sexual abuse of children was only one part of the Franklin story. During the 1980s, many of the children, such as Alisha Owen and Paul Bonacci, said that they had been used as drug couriers to bring cocaine in from the West Coast for Alan Baer, Larry King, and others. Then, on September 11, 1996, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Representative Harold James, chairman of Pennsylvania's Leg­ islative Black Caucus, and a former undercover narcotics cop himself, also put out a call for an investigation. In the course of that press conference another name popped up, that I knew well from the Franklin investigation: George Bush. Flanked by political leaders of both the city and the state, James declared: \"As a retired undercover Philadelphia police officer who worked on narcotics cases, I know we can better impact the flow of drugs if we stop drugs from coming into this country, arrest those at the top levels of control, and punish the white-collar dealers who try to keep their hands clean while they run the entire operation. On this occasion, we must not allow anyone to use the pretext of national security to accom­ plish another cover-up. We need an investigation that goes right to the top.\" As to where the \"top\" might be, James charged, in his release to the press, \"previous investigations of the Iran-Contra scandal, particularly the U.S. House and Senate joint hearings in 1987, revealed the central role played by then Vice-President George Bush in covert intelligence operations .... One of Bush's key lieutenants was Oliver North. Bush was also appointed by Reagan to run the National Narcotics Border Interdiction Sys­ tem, which supposedly coordinated efforts of all federal, state and local anti-drug agencies, especially along the south Florida coast. Bush was responsible for the White House anti-drug 321"},{"pageNumber":362,"pageContent":"322 • THE FRANKLIN COVER-UP effort while, at the same time, according to the recent newspaper reports, tons of cocaine were allegedly supplied to street gangs by CIA-related networks.\" Concluded James, \"There's something wrong with this pic­ ture.\" In response to a question from one of the ten reporters in attendance about the role of Bush, Philadelphia City Council President John Street replied, \"If George Bush is involved in it, someone should find it out. This kind of activity has been going on for well over a decade.\" Lt. Col. Oliver North-whom at least one witness reported seeing at a party thrown by Larry King-had overseen the Contra resupply effort, and had been fully aware of the plane­ loads of drugs coming into the United States. A U.S. Senate subcommittee report under Massachusetts Senator John Kerry cited extensive evidence that the Contras were involved in drugs, and North had noted the fact in his publicly exposed note­ books. From what I know from my own corner of the world, there is excellent reason to investigate Bush for possible involvement in the dope business. Think back to what I reported in Chapter 13, \"The Washington Connection,\" about how George Bush and Larry King were linked in multiple ways, including eyewitness reports placing Bush at King's sex parties. Think about the constant rumors that King was financing the Contras, who have now been proved to have been running dope by the ton. The first investigative reporter to ever look at Franklin, the World Herald's James Flanery, told associates that King was \"running guns and money into Nicaragua,\" and that the CIA was heavily involved. (Flanery was soon taken off the story and shipped out of state for a year.) Records exist to show that Larry King was a top contributor to a Contra \"support committee,\" the Citizens for America (CFA). King's own public relations firm was also used by the Contras. I became convinced early on that King was deeply involved with the Contras. I am reminded of the phone call State Senator Loran Schmit received on the Senate floor as the Franklin case was just beginning to break. The caller warned him off the"},{"pageNumber":363,"pageContent":"• • • DRUGS AND THE MONARCH PROJECT • case, because \"it would lead to the highest levels of the Republi­ can party.\" I am reminded of when Larry King was finally arrested-just as he was about to go to a breakfast party in Omaha for his buddy, George Bush! I am reminded of the reports I used to hear that certain people in Omaha were charg­ ing that Omaha Police Chief Bob Wadman was protecting the expansion of the Cryps and Bloods into Omaha-far from their home turf of Los Angeles. So, was Larry King's buddy George Bush the country's \"drug kingpin\" in the 1980s? I don't know. But what I do know, is that if Bush were running the Contra affair, and drugs were a big part of it, that would certainly jibe 100% with everything known or rumored about Bush, Larry King, and the Franklin Credit Union. Congresswoman Maxine Waters and Representative Harold James are right-let's investigate! As follow-up investigation from the Franklin case shows, drugs are not the deepest level of government-sponsored evil. I think the lowest level of Hell is reserved for those who conjured up and carried out the \"Monarch Project.\" \"Monarch\" refers to young people in America who were victims of mind control experiments run either by U.S. govern­ ment agencies such as the Central Intelligence Agency, or military intelligence agencies. The story told by Monarch victims-one of whom is Paul Bonacci-is that they were tortured for the purpose of creating \"multiple personalities\" within them. These multiple personali­ ties could then be programmed as desired-as spies, \"drug mules,\" prostitutes, or assassins. Because of legal cases still pending, I am severely limited in what I can say about the Monarch Project. Suffice it to say at this point: Major intelligence programs in this country did and do exist for the purpose of protection of this country and to learn what other countries, particularly our Cold War enemies, were doing in this area of mind control. 323"},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":"324 • THE FRANKLIN COVER·UP I asked Bill Colby to tell me what he could or would, about this. He said: \"Of course the CIA in particular was involved in investigat­ ing, learning and, on occasion, using, everything we could learn about mind control-and with extremely good reason. Following the Korean War, this country's military and intelli­ gence communities went through a period of absolute paranoia about just how far our enemies were ahead of us in mind control and related activities. \"There was no particular program called 'Monarch,' contrary to what you want to think. 'Monarch' was merely a name that some participants in the program-who knew very little about it, other than from their own limited participation-were given to identify themselves. But, as far as the CIA was concerned, there was no such program named 'Monarch.' \"But, with respect to mind control, I will tell you that this country spent millions upon millions supposedly catching up to our Cold War adversaries, because we believed they had developed mind control technology which exceeded anything we had. In fact, we at the Company [CIA] truly believed for a substantial period of time, that technology and techniques and drugs had been developed by Russia which would enable them to have agents who in fact really were able to have and use ESP-extra sensory perception. \"Can you imagine,\" Bill continued, \"how dangerous for this country it would be if you could have had someone meeting the President of the United States, who was actually able to read what was in the President's mind? \"I know,\" Bill continued, \"it may sound silly today to get all carried away with this fear; but I can tell you that we took it all very seriously and believed this ESP thing for some significant time period. \"I will tell you one other thing,\" Bill said, somewhat omi­ nously, \"we are not behind in knowledge of mind control. In fact, we never were, but we only found that out much later, after we had poured incredible resources into this area.

And, I intend, when I am freed from court restrictions, to tell that entire story in an upcoming book. I have deposited extensive documentation on the Mon­ arch Project with people who have the means, the motivation, and, most importantly, the guts, to print the entire story, should I suffer an \"accident\" before I get around to it. Here, I will merely quote from the work of one of America's finest investi­ gative reporters, Anton Chaitkin. I had known of Chaitkin, who writes for Executive Intelli­ gence Review magazine, from the book he co-authored with Webster Tarpley, George Bush: The Unauthorized Biography. This 659-page-book is a devastating expose of Bush, and it played a notable role in helping to shape the 1992 presidential campaign, which Bush happily lost. Perhaps it was because the name \"Bush\" was all over the Franklin scandal, that Chaitkin showed up one day in my Lin­ coln law office. I told him, \"Look, I know you have been in some tough spots before, but are you really sure you want to poke around in this? This question of 'mind control' -the Monarch Project-is the most scary and dangerous thing I have ever encountered.\" As I came to know Anton, probably all that little lecture did was to spur him on. Chaitkin got his story on the Monarch Project, and printed it in the December 13, 1993, New Federalist newspaper under the headline, \"Franklin Case Witnesses Implicate FBI and U.S. Elites in Child-Torture and Murder.\" Here follows an abbreviated version of that article: WHAT IS THE FBI PROTECTING? Since the 1992 publication of John DeCamp's book, The Franklin Cover-Up, Paul Bonacci has filed new affidavits and has given extensive interviews to investigators including report­ ers for Executive Intelligence Review and New Federalist.

The result goes a long way to explain the high stakes involved, and the frantic nature of the Franklin cover-up .... Paul Bonacci has described in detail being dragged to Wash­ ington for use as a sex toy for Larry King's clients. Bonacci told investigators he was in one of the private White House tours for young male prostitutes conducted by lobbyist Craig Spence, a close political associate of Larry King in the cloak­ and-dagger Contras enterprise. Spence turned up dead in a Boston hotel room in 1989, soon after his and King's \"compro­ mising\" business was exposed in a Washington Times June 29, 1989 story, headlined: \"Homosexual Prostitution Inquiry Ensnares VIPs with Reagan, Bush.\" 'MONARCH,' OR, AUSCHWITZ-TAKE 2 From very early childhood, Paul Bonacci was subjected to tortures as profound as any the Nazis inflicted on their captives. This is not merely a comparison; rather it is an actual continua­ tion, as we shall see. From sexual degradation, from witnessing and forced participation in Satanic cult murders, Bonacci suf­ fered the cracking of his mind into what is called \"multiple personality disorder\" (MPD). Tens of thousands of American children have been diagnosed MPDs; virtually all of them are thought to have resulted from sexual abuse, of which perhaps 85 percent were cases of Satanic ritual abuse. Psychiatric professionals specified in Paul Bonacci's legal proceedings that through it all, Paul's different \"personalities\" have emerged incapable of lying, with an ultra-sharp memory. In one instance detailed in The Franklin Cover-Up, Paul was taken by Larry King and others to a wooded area in California-identified after publication as the Bohemian Grove. There Paul and another boy were forced to do sex acts with and to consume parts of a child whom they had watched being"},{"pageNumber":367,"pageContent":"DRUGS AND THE MONARCH PROJECT • murdered by the cultists. The body was to be disposed of by \"the men with the hoods.\" A \"snuff' pornography film was made of these events; it was directed by a man the party had picked up in Las Vegas whom Paul identified as \"Hunter Thompson\"-the same name as a well known sleaze-culture figure. Paul has told investigators that the ring which plunged him into Satanism was centered at Offutt U.S. Air Force Base near Omaha; that he was taken to Offutt to be sexually victimized by a babysitter's boyfriend when he was about three years old, around 1970. Offutt is the headquarters for the Strategic Air Command, and has had a cadre of thousands of intelligence per­ sonnel. At Offutt, and later at other military installations, Paul says this ring \"trained\" him by tortures, heavy drugging, and sexual degradation, while instructing him in military arts including assassination. In fact, his personal knowledge in these realms can scarcely be accounted for other than by crediting the indict­ ments he has made. Larry King, FBI agent Gerry Wahl, Alan Baer, Harold An­ dersen, and former Omaha Police Chief Robert Wadman have all been reported as collaborators with this Satanic military­ based ring. King reportedly told Paul's captors at Offutt, \"He's young-but you trained him good.\" A member of Nebraska's Concerned Parents group reported hearing from two North Omaha witnesses that \"King used to send limousines down to Offutt Air Base to pick up CIA agents for parties.\" Larry King reported his own adoring relationship to the late CIA Director William Casey in a Sept. 7, 1988, interview in the Omaha publication Metropolitan. Psychiatrists who have treated a growing number of MPD cases, victims of Satanic ritual abuse, report an alarming pattern of findings in many of their child patients. There is a structure to the personalities, conforming to what is evidently a deliberate breaking and reshaping of the mind. This phenomenon was identified to Paul Bonacci by his tormenters, and to other vic­ tims and witnesses, as the \"Monarch\" project.

A national security pretext often cited was the need to keep up with the Soviets in the race to develop a workable Manchurian Candidate human robot. With the \"Monarch\" (or whatever official title may be attached to it) project, the idea is extended to the production of a horde of children in whom the soul is crushed, who would spy, whore, kill, and commit suicide.

Professionals probing the child victims of \"Monarch\" say there are clearly two responsible elements at work: the govern­ ment/military, and cooperating Satanic (or more exactly pagan) cults. These are multi-generation groups, where parents donate their own children-who are proudly called \"bloodline\" or simply \"blood\" cultists-to be smashed with drugs and elec­ tric shock, and shaped. Other children are kidnapped and sold into this hell, or are brought in gradually through day-care situa­ tions. Paul Bonacci and other child victims have given evidence in great depth on the central role of Lt. Col. Michael Aquino in this depravity. Aquino, alleged to have recently retired from an active military role, was long the leader of an Army psycho­ logical warfare section which drew on his \"expertise\" and personal practices in brainwashing, Satanism, Nazism, homo­ sexual pedophilia and murder. A former director of the CIA was asked directly, \"what about 'Monarch' \"? He replied angrily, and ambiguously, \"We stopped that between the late 1960s and the early 1970s.\" If a statement of fact, this would presumably relate to official participation of the CIA."},{"pageNumber":369,"pageContent":"DRUGS AND THE MONARCH PROJECT • SOME CODES AND ASSIGNMENTS The disclosures of Paul Bonacci, which cohere with reports of MPD professionals in other cases, point to a particular artifi­ cially induced mental structure as common to many victimized children. Space permits only the briefest treatment of this here; this is intended mainly to begin to \"blow the circuits,\" so to speak, when followed up by professional therapists and investi­ gators. These are some of the widely occurring separate \"persons\" which have been formed under torture, and the correspond­ ing \"triggers\": • General personality-accessible under the code name ALPHA, with possible Alpha-DOl, Alpha-009, etc. \"persons\" with distinct task orientations. • Sex programs, accessible through code name BETA; par­ ticular programs (and thus commands) are for pornography, acting, oral sex, etc. • Assassination programs, utilizing very specific modes, and espionage, accessible through code DELTA. • OMEGA, self-destruction programs, ranging from self­ mutilation to suicide by many different specific possible acts. • GAMMA, system deception, amnesia and disinformation programs. Under this or other codes are track-covering false origins for the structure, giving the child memories of torment­ ers dressed as space aliens or Mickey Mouse or in Wizard of Oz costumes. There are said to be such other personality levels as Master Programmer, Black Master, and different mental levels of backup programs. There are reported to be personnel who have large numbers of child-victims' assignments and triggers neatly filed in their little computers.

Paul cites travel to the Netherlands and Germany carrying child pornography for sub­ sequent \"import\" to the U.S.A. to avoid prosecution. In Amster­ dam, he names \"Charles Hester,\" and the British \"Tommie Carter,\" who had on computer a global list of child pornography users. NAMBLA is also cited for organizing auctions of children. • Travel to Hawaii, New York, Washington (in connection with Craig Spence) to compromise public figures by performing homosexual pedophile sex with them. • The trip to California where the boy was ritually murdered, accompanied by \"Monarch\" contact, Mark Johnson of Den­ ver, Colorado, • Travel to Mexico for the transportation of drugs, guns, and children. Paul was accompanied by the gangster-figure \"Emilio,\" who otherwise directed the kidnapping of Johnny Gosch of Des Moines, Iowa. Johnny Gosch's parents commend Paul Bonacci as an accurate witness relative to that crime. • Training under \"Captain Foster\" (survival skills) at Fort Riley, Kansas, under \"Lt. Dave Bannister\" (intelligence) at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, under \"Col. Harris Livik\" at Fort Defiance, Virginia, who is said to run a military school and to have housed \"Monarch\" boys. \"Col.

Nazi experimentation in World War II concentration camps were said to have gone beyond simply insane physical tortures. They brainwashed people, for military and strategic purposes. After the war, Allen Dulles and other Western intelli­ gence people brought Nazi doctors out for use in the United States. A teenaged concentration camp inmate named Green­ baum, who had participated to save himself, also came to the United States. Known later as \"Dr. Green,\" he became a high­ level brainwasher, and is widely represented in brainwashing programs with a distinctive Cabalistic magic theme. The precise details of these horrors lie deeply buried in national security archives. But this history, as told to psychia­ trists, dovetails with what is definitively known about Anglo­ American intelligence operations and the German Nazis. And once again, the story goes right back to Nebraska. The killers in the Nazi camps were themselves trained and organized by psychiatrists and eugenicists, operating from the \"T4\" bureau. These psychiatrists had long been the pets of white supremacist British and American financier networks. At least some of these Nazi doctors were spirited out of Germany under the supervision of former Bank of England Governor Montagu Norman and Tavistock Institute Director John R. Rees on behalf of the British government. Norman, personally an insane Theosophist who had been chief of the prewar pro-Nazi faction within England, and Rees organized postwar propaganda and continuing psychological warfare ac­ tivities, and created \"Orwellian\" groupings within U.S. psychia­ try and mental health fields. 331"},{"pageNumber":372,"pageContent":"332 CHAPTER 22 FROM MONTANA TO OKLAHOMA CITY Within hours after the bomb-or bombs-exploded in front of the Federal Building in Oklahoma City, on April 19, 1995, FBI agents were in my office in Lincoln, Nebraska, seeking my assistance to identify the bombers. Why would the FBI come to Lincoln, Nebraska, to see a lawyer named John DeCamp on a bombing in Oklahoma? Just weeks before, I had successfully represented the leader­ ship and members of a group identifying itself as the Militia of Montana (MOM), in one of the strangest cases in which I had ever been involved. It was through reading the first edition of The Franklin Cover-Up, that the Militia of Montana got my name and sought my assistance. Until they called me in early 1995, I had not even known that militias existed in this country nor, of course, that these \"militias\" were being closely watched by the FBI and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) and being viewed as a national security danger. The Militia of Montana contacted me in a state of terror after their leaders and leaders of another group identifying themselves as \"The Freemen,\" were physically assaulted, seized, and arrested in the town of Roundup, Montana, in early January 1995. I was shocked, as I listened to the story of their arrest, imprisonment and physical abuse by public officials. Why? Because these men were arrested and tortured, put under bond requirements in the range of hundreds of thousands of dollars, charged with the crime of sedition with mandatory"},{"pageNumber":373,"pageContent":"• • • FROM MONTANA TO OKLAHOMA CITY • 10- and 20-year prison terms, and were about to go to trial. My question was, \"For what?!\" It quickly evolved that their \"crime\" was that they had met with individuals like them­ selves-not for any actual violation of the law. As I investigated, and learned just how unconstitutional these arrests were, I agreed to take their case-even though I did not necessarily support, or even know, their beliefs or philos­ ophy. Why did I do this? I have always been a zealous defender of the First Amend­ ment-Freedom of Speech, Press, Assembly. This Militia of Montana case convinced me that irrespective of what I person­ ally thought about the beliefs of the MOM Leaders or the Freemen, these individuals had done nothing wrong, but were classic victims of improper government arrest, harassment, and abuse. As the case went on, I became very assertive on behalf of these men, angered by what had happened-and was still happening-under color of law. Soon, the major media focused attention on the case, telling wild lies about the facts of the incident surrounding the arrests. In February and March and April of 1995, talk shows repeatedly requested me to explain the true story, which I did. Meanwhile, militia groups from across the United States began marshaling to come to Montana, and to deal with the imprisonment of the MOM and Freemen in some fashion outside the court room; this caused me grave concern. The Attorney General of Montana became involved in the case, along with federal officials at various levels, who fever­ ishly worked to create a case to justify the imprisonment and abuse of these men. As the deadline approached for determining whether there was to be a full scale trial to attempt to permanently lock these men up, I, acting as their attorney, gave a written ultimatum to the Attorney General and to the Governor of Montana. I reprint it here, just as I delivered it to the Attorney General, the Governor, and to the Montana State Legislature: 333"},{"pageNumber":374,"pageContent":"334 • THE FRANKLIN COVER·UP Memorandum from: JOHN W.

I would also, on their behalf, make the following offer to resolve in advance any civil rights litigation that my clients may initiate against the entities involved in the episode of arrest, incarceration, charges, that occurred: If the State would make a public apology to them, explain to the public the real truth on what occurred and why it occurred, insure the dismissal of the two MusselShell County deputies involved, and pay the sum of $1.00 (One Dollar) to my clients, they would waive their civil rights case that we believe they absolutely have against the various entities and personalities involved in this most interesting story. Having said these things, John, let me present to you first the results of our/my investigation as well as some surprising offers and requests that I doubt any defendants have ever offered in Montana-or maybe anywhere else, for that matter. SITUATION: IIWe believe the episode culminating in the arrest and filing of charges against the \"Montana Seven\" began with: (1) A Con Job by a long-time repeat offender, (Call him John Doe),"},{"pageNumber":375,"pageContent":"FROM MONTANA TO OKLAHOMA CITY • who was arrested and incarcerated again on or about late Feb. 1995 for very serious spousal abuse. John Doe had become obsessed with a jealous rage and anger because he believed that a certain individual, one of the Montana Seven and a so­ called Freeman had a \"Relationship\" with his wife that he did not sanction while he, John Doe, was previously incarcerated. John Doe also knew that the charges he was facing were very grave. More important, John Doe knew that the MusselShell Sheriff's office (particularly Deputy Buzz Jones) was himself obsessed with concerns and fears and hatreds of the Freeman and/or the Montana Militia. John Doe solved his incarceration problem by spinning a tale for Deputy Jones-and later others-to the effect that the Freemen were on the verge of kidnapping and hanging public officials, particularly a Judge, as well as robbing banks and doing any sort of other dastardly deed that John Doe could spin a tale about and which MusselShell officials were ready to lap up without proper investigation or analysis. Naturally, John Doe identified his former friend, one of the Montana Seven and a Freeman, as one who was to be involved in this tale of terror-and described well his truck, items in it, etc.­ including a pile of money, gold and guns to watch out for. And thus, with one fantastic-though fantasy-tale, John Doe solved his incarceration problem and his jealousy problem, we believe the evidence will clearly show and which we believe the state is now aware of. And, with fears being driven by the Con Job of John Doe on certain public officials, on Feb. 27, 1995, warnings were issued from Federal and Other officials that armageddon was about to descend upon poor little Roundup from an invasion of the Freemen or Montana Militia, or whoever. FICKLE FI NGER OF FATE: Next, enter the fickle finger of fate-and, of course, paranoia and probably incompetence on the part of the local officials of MusselShell County, Montana. And this drama unfolds. 335"},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":"336 • THE FRANKLIN COVER·UP Seven individuals-some who did not even know or had never even met each other before, and comprised of individuals some of whom were members of the Montana Militia and others who were members of the Freemen-all ended up in Roundup at about the same time, but for different reasons. Defendant Dale Martin Jacobi of Thompson Falls, a busi­ nessman who just sold his business and has the cash from the sale and other property-guns from his home since he is moving them; equipment from his business electrical/plbg/htng busi­ ness-rides into Roundup in his 1 ton 83 Chevy right after using part of his business sale proceeds to buy some gold coins in Billings. Accompanying Jacobi was his friend and, because Jacobi was carrying his stash of loot from sale of his business, body­ guard, Frank Eugene Ellena of Billings. Frank had borrowed a two way business network radio­ completely legal, licensed, etc.-from another \"Desperado\" who ended up a member of the Montana Seven, namely, busi­ nessman Amando Gerry Lopez of Rexford. Lopez, also a Free­ man, used the equipment in his business and allowed Frank to have the radio because Frank wanted to have access to assis­ tance because he and Jacobi were carrying the cash mentioned above. Frank also had to file some \"Trust Papers\" in the court­ house in Roundup for some property Frank had bought in the county. Meanwhile, John Trochman, not a Freeman, but founder of the Montana Militia, had come to the area to meet with F.B.I. officials whom he works with, and to allay any concerns or disagreements or mis-understandings between representatives of the Freemen Group and the Montana Militia. Now comes Paul D.

And Cajun James, a legally li­ censed gun salesman, has been given an order for purchase of weapons (single shot, I might add) from Mr. Switzer also. Mr. Switzer utilizes a CMO for his purchases (Certified Money Order) which he believes has value but which there seems to be considerable disagremeent on as to how much value it has in the overall financial community-but that is not an issue in the arrest of these individuals, merely an interest­ ing sidebar. On Friday, March 3, 1995, the Fickle Finger of Fate caused Deputy Buzz Jones to arrest, rather violently and without sound reason, Mr. Jacobi and Mr. Ellena in Roundup and to search their vehicle. Deputy Jones found just what his con informant had told him he might find gold, hordes of cash, guns, radio equipment, and two individuals who belonged to the militant groups he, Deputy Jones hated. Deputy Jones apparently believed he was on the verge of stopping an invasion, kidnapping, murder and worse. And, under those circumstances, why not rough up the individuals you have arrested? Why not scream obscenities at them and threaten them and tell them that those f --- Freemen are not going to take over his town. And Deputy Jones did that ... and a lot more. But, unknown to Deputy Jones, watching from a short dis­ tance was one of the other Freemen who then contacted the other individuals named here and said they should check on what was going on. Besides, as Lopez said, \"They got my radio and I need it for my business and I can't afford another one. They cost $500.00 and I am going to go to the Sheriff and see if they will give it back to me.\" COMEDY TURNS TO SERIOUS TRAGEDY So, in two separate vehicles, the other individuals named drive over to the Sheriff s office to check on their friends and to ask for the return of Mr. Lopez's radio. 337"},{"pageNumber":378,"pageContent":"338 • THE FRANKLIN COVER·UP The tale gets controversial and tragic here. A couple of the defendants go into the sheriff's office to seek return of the Lopez radio and the others wait in their car properly parked in front of the sheriff's office. None of the Montana Seven defendants does anything improper or illegal. All are polite. But, suddenly, with lightning speed and led by Deputy Jones, the officials assault these individuals. They believe, apparently driven by paranoia, they have a right to capture. Again, led by Deputy Jones, the Montana Seven are trussed up like hogs; handcuffed with their hands behind their backs; forced to lie for six hours in pain on concrete trussed up and handcuffed. They abuse them in a variety of other ways, threaten them with loaded shotguns in their backs and chests, break out car windows, question them in violation of all legal and proper police standards; charge them with felonies of every ilk and description and fabricate allegations to support their charges and their actions. The officials lie to the relatives and friends calling in to the sheriff's office and repeatedly deny that the Montana Seven are even at the jail or have been arrested. And these things recited here are the nicest things the local officials do. THEN SA NITY STARTS TO RETURN Believing they have captured the seven most dangerous men in America, the local sheriff and his cohorts bring in the Feds. The Feds figure out-we believe-that they are in the midst of a comedy of errors and misunderstandings and after question­ ing the Montana Seven, quickly get out of any further involve­ ment in the matters pending and return everything to local officials. We believe they, the Feds, are the ones who alerted the Attorney General of Montana of the need for some proper law enforcement involvement ... but we do not know.

Hundred Thousand Dollar Bonds are reduced to ten thousand dollar bond and communication is established between the attorney for the Montana Seven, my­ self, and the A.G.'s office. Of course, before sanity begins returning, politicians (and I sure understand this) leap on the bandwagon and proclaim the evils of the terrorists and how the state must not be a victim of such terrorists; the media hypes the story-without benefit of accurate facts or any responsible investigative reporting and-the families and businesses of the Montana Seven are horribly damaged. And, the local law enforcement officials who prompted the comedy, \"leak\" one sordid and wild tale after another to the media as to what \"really\" occurred. It is time now, John, to tether ourselves to reality instead of to Rambo and resolve this case. And that is what I am offering to do with this letter. As a sample of how far reality and what was being perceived as reality were separated, let me provide you some of the evidence grabbed which was supposed to support a charge (remember the claims in the media being supported by \"leaks\" from Local Officials, particularly Deputy Jones) of counter­ feiting. Attached is the $3.00 bill which was the basis for the claim. You might note, John, that if this is counterfeiting, then every novelty store, gift shop and curio shop in America is in the business of counterfeiting and marketing counterfeit money. Yet, John, this was probably the closest to reason of any of the charges against the individuals. As a final offer to get this settled and in the best interest of getting some accurate information to all Montanans, my clients would like to make the following offer: Each of my clients would undergo a polygraph test on any material question relating to these charges against them or the events and incidents surrounding this. They would want you to bring in the best polygraph expert(s) in the country. They would agree in advance that any results of the testingfor any and all of them, no matter whether it showed positive or negative for them, would be admissible in court, civil or criminal. 119"},{"pageNumber":380,"pageContent":"• • • 340 • THE FRANKLIN COVER·UP There would be only one condition: That is, they insist the two Deputies and local officials in Musselshell County also be subject to the same terms and conditions. That is, polygraph examination on the material facts surrounding the arrest, incar­ ceration, filing of charges, police brutality, etc. Finally, for the benefit of all Montanans, they agree in ad­ vance that any representatives of the press would be allowed to be present at the polygraph examination and submit any questions they might have about the events. Why all this? So much injury and damage has been done and so much disinformation has been put out that it is in the best interest of everybody, including particularly the Montana Seven, that the truth get out. And it is in the best interests of everybody, that Law Enforcement be held to the same standards of truth and responsibility they expect of the citizens. Again, I would repeat my offer as outlined in the beginning of this letter; and with these additional incentives I have just mentioned, polygraph, willingness to answer any questions for the press, it seems it would be beneficial for everyone to get these matters resolved, sanity restored and the situation de-esca­ lated. Awaiting your reply I remain, Respectfully, John W. DeCamp, Attorney for the Montana Seven [All emphasis in original.] The official response of the Attorney General of Montana to my ultimatum, was to say that the state of Montana was proceeding with the trial on charges of criminal syndicalism (sedition).

When the press told me what the Governor and the Attorney General were purporting, I replied, \"This story is pure fantasy, an attempt by public officials to excuse their mistakes. I dare Montana and its officials to go to trial on these bogus charges, because Montana will lose, and its criminal syndicalism laws will be declared unconstitutional.\" Then, in March 1995, at the last minute before my deadline for dismissal of the charges, the Attorney General's office swept into Roundup, dismissed all the charges, and informed the press that Montana officials were not responding to my demands, but were dismissing the charges because the Attorney General \"needed more evidence\" to prove his case. My goal to free these men had been accomplished. For that 1 felt proud and satisfied. The case received much national attention-especially with law enforcement at both the state and the federal level, and I became somewhat of a legend among the patriot and militia movement. At the height of the \"Montana Seven\" case, as it came to be known, I had been dealing directly with the Montana Governor's office, the Attorney General's office and officials in Washington, as well as with the national press, trying to prevent an outbreak of violence spawned by either the militias or by the government. During February, and particularly in March and early April of 1995, rumors were flying through the entire Militia and Patriot community on almost an hourly basis, warning of immi­ nent raids by federal officials against militia compounds. Na­ tionwide, militias were circulating reports in all their fax, press and phone networks, that these raids were coming, and that the militia members had better be prepared.

Based on this, I will give here my best assessment ivironmenr in the militia world, on the eve of what actually happened-what Americans in future years Given my role in the midst of this, it was will understand about the events in Oklahoma City. Feds showed up on my doorstep right after As noted, my first involvement came when the F.E.I. sought ibing. my assistance, because of my successful representation of vari­ ous militia groups across the United States. Then, certain bombing victims asked me to file civil litigation against whomever caused their injuries. Some of these victims were in hospitals at the time, severely injured, and able to speak only through writing notes to others to deliver to me. I immediately put together an investigative team to look at the event and to try to determine what had actually occurred. The head of that team was Ted Gunderson, the former Special Agent in Charge (SAC) of the FBI's Los Angeles field office, who had had 800 agents working under him, and with whom I had collaborated in the Franklin case. Ted and his team arrived in Oklahoma before the dust had even settled from the explosion. Much later, after this initial work was completed, I became the attorney for a man named Hoppi Heidelberg, who was one of the federal grand jurors who had helped to indict Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols for the Oklahoma City bombing. Hoppi came to me because he believed the government planned to indict him for his work on the grand jury. It seems that 343"},{"pageNumber":384,"pageContent":"344 • THE FRANKLIN COVER·UP Heidelberg had read his instructions on his responsibility and authority as a member of a federal grand jury, and was deter­ mined to do his job. Hoppi Heidelberg is a true patriot. Hoppi had come to the conclusion that the government was covering up facts, was refusing to deal properly with the grand jury, and was trying to narrow the case to Mr. McVeigh and Mr. Nichols. Hoppi has said on talk shows nationwide, that he believes that there is a \"John Doe 2\"-and probably 3 and 4­ and that the government is refusing to share that information with the American people. Hoppi was in fact removed from the grand jury-after the indictments of Me Veigh and Nichols. I emphasize at this point that nothing 1 say here violates, in my opinion, any information I learned from grand juror Hoppi Heidelberg, either from the standpoint of violating federal grand jury laws or violating attorney client relationships. All informa­ tion disclosed here, was obtained by me from my own separate investigations. With respect to my own investigation of the bombing on behalf of injured victims, the following events raised serious questions in my mind in regards to the case: 1. Our investigation revealed that the so-called fertilizer bomb could not, by itself, have caused the destruction of the Federal Building, and in the manner described. Today, there are many theories, including the \"Hydro-Dynamic\" theory of a \"hydrodynamic\" super-bomb, which is highly classified, and which would have been used in conjunction with the basic fertilizer bomb. There are also the theories of General Partin, a well-known retired army general, of bombs of different types, including the possibility that bombs were placed inside at key points in the building to destroy its supports. Our investigation shows that the fertilizer bomb-as it has been described by government officials as the single source of the explosive-is not accurate. Highly qualified military personnel have observed, that if the explosion were to have been the result of only the fertilizer bomb, then a degree of expertise would have been required for its construction and placement, far beyond the capabilities of either McVeigh or Nichols. Such a fertilizer bomb would have to be a precisely"},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":"THE .OKLAHOMA BOMBING-THE REAL STORY • constructed \"shape charge,\" all of whose force would have to be directed at the building's supports, and at precisely the right angle. 2. In the investigation, I retained the most respected (and expensive) bomb experts in the world, John A. Kennedy and Associates, Inc., out of Hoffman Estates, Illinois. They had investigated the World Trade Center bombing, and are recog­ nized as one of the world's best, if not the best, in the field. 3. I prepared documents to go to court to force the govern­ ment to keep the Federal Building standing long enough for experts to examine the building, the soil, and environs, to establish what caused the destruction, in particular what type of explosive was used. 4. Only hours before I was to file the legal papers for a civil action to keep the building standing, I was contacted by Timothy McVeigh's attorneys, who presented me with two major requests. First, they asked that I allow them to file the motions to keep the building standing so that the investigation could be conducted. They had cogent legal arguments for this request: because McVeigh was/is under federal criminal charges, he had the definite legal right to keep the building standing under federal rules of evidence which grant criminal defendants the right to preserve evidence that would significantly impact their defense. It was clear that if McVeigh's attorneys believed, or even suspected government cover-up, they would definitely want the building examined. Their second request was that I release from retainer the bomb investigation team I had assembled-John A. Kennedy and Associates-which, they claimed, they wanted to hire. I granted these requests to Mcveigh's attorneys. A few hours later, I watched in horror as CNN and all the national news channels reported that McVeigh's attorneys had no intent to file any motions to keep the Federal Building standing. They had \"just reached agreement with the govern­ ment,\" the reporters explained, to permit the building to be destroyed almost immediately. Angry beyond belief, I called McVeigh's attorney and asked 345"},{"pageNumber":386,"pageContent":"• • • • THE FRANKLIN COVER-UP what they were doing. Since this all occurred on a weekend, I could take no legal action to stop the building's destruction. Mcveigh's attorney told me, \"Oh yes, we are going to allow the building to be destroyed.\" \"Why?\" I demanded. \"Because we could not afford to pay the retainer fee that the Kennedy and Associates firm wanted,\" he answered. Shocked by this feeble explanation, I asked, \"Well, just how much do they want?\" Mcveigh's attorney floored me: \"$30,000,\" he said. \"And we have no resources to pay it, because we are a court-appointed attorney and there are no funds for this purpose.\" \"For God's sake!\" I screamed at him. \"I will raise the money! I will pay the fee! There is too much at stake for America. How,\" I demanded, \"can McVeigh go along with wanting that building destroyed, when that building is the one thing that can tell America the story of what really happened? I will get you the money, somehow, but don't refuse to keep the building up for that reason!\" My protests were futile. Within hours of my call, by mutual agreement between McVeigh's attorneys and the government prosecutors, the building was destroyed, and any evidence was destroyed with it. What really did happen in Oklahoma City?

The government supervisors actively provided government resources and assistance-through their informants and infil­ trators-to McVeigh and Nichols. They may have even pro­ vided certain chemicals and materiel. Most importantly, the government supervisors were aware of the planning of the bomb, the personalities involved, and the resources available. There was a John Doe I and a John Doe 2 and probably several other John Does-but they were the government infil­ trators the government dare not admit existed, lest the American public find out just how deeply involved the government was. There is still the open question of terrorism against the United States by a foreign power-but this would involve complicity with at least certain U.S. agencies or personnel. It is certain that the government knew from the beginning, that there were no organized militias or militia conspiracy involved in the bombing as such. Yet, government spokesmen in a coordinated fashion fostered the idea that the militias were involved, and that the militias were the most dangerous animal facing all Americans. For months after the Oklahoma bombing, witch hunts against the militias were carried out under the government cover of \"national security\" -the same cover used and abused far too often in the last two decades of American history, including in the Iran/Contra trial. The government's legitimate concern with national security has been turned into a banner under which government officials and judges and agencies and politicians can, and do get away with almost anything and everything. They cover their mistakes. They cover their expenditures. They cover their sins. And they are covering up the true story of the Oklahoma bombing, not necessarily because they intend to be evil (I hope), but most likely because they cannot admit how their own negligence contributed to it. At least, that is what I believe at this point. 347"},{"pageNumber":388,"pageContent":"348 CHAPTER 24 THE U. S.

Petitioner Kahl alleges that he is in custody in violation of the Constitution of the United States. The Petitioner suffered through a trial involving prosecutorial misconduct and a biased judge.

This Statement of Facts has been prepared for the benefit of the judiciary who will be reviewing this case for the first time. I. INTRODUCTION The case before this Court is complex. It involves a chain of events and a compounding of errors that occurred over a time frame of several years. On February 13, 1983, Yorie Kahl was in a group who were involved in a shooting incident with United States Marshals and others in Medina, North Dakota. Four United States Marshals and two local Law Enforcement Officers attempted to serve an arrest warrant on Gordon Kahl for an alleged violation of misdemeanor probation. A gun battle erupted and two U.S. Marshals were killed. Three other law enforcement officers were injured as well as the Petitioner, Yorie Kahl. As a direct result of the \"shoot out\", Petitioner Yorie Kahl was charged with and convicted of second degree murder, assaulting federal officers, harboring a fugitive and conspiracy. Before this case can be understood it is critical that events leading up to the confrontation be examined and understood. The Kahl Saga, involving both Father Gordon and Son, Yorie, consists of four significant episodes. These are: (l) Preliminary 349"},{"pageNumber":390,"pageContent":"350 • THE FRANKLIN COVER-UP causes, 1976-1982; (2) The \"Shoot-out\" event at Medina, North Dakota on February 13, 1983; (3) The trial in which Petitioner Yorie Kahl was convicted, February 14 through June 24, 1983; and (4) The death of Gordon Kahl in Arkansas, June 3, 1983. II. EVENTS LEADING UP TO MEDINA Yorie Von Kahl, the Petitioner, is the son of the late Gordon Kahl. Gordon Kahl was a farmer and decorated veteran of World War II. Gordon Kahl held strong religious and political convictions. Gordon Kahl came to the conclusion in the 1970' s that America was headed politically and morally in the wrong direction. This distressed Gordon Kahl. Despite his personal lack of resources, he felt he had an obligation to share his beliefs and views with anyone who would listen. Towards this end, Gordon Kahl regularly spoke out publicly, criticizing the Government and particularly the federal income tax system. Often Gordon Kahl used the media and public gatherings to spread his message. A. POLITICAL ACTIVISM Gordon Kahl was particularly outspoken and a strong critic of what he perceived to be the perversion of politics, law and Justice that Kahl believed was occurring in America. So prolific were Gordon Kahl's written and verbal attacks on what he sincerely believed to be unconstitutional applications of laws (Income Tax, Federal Reserve System), that he eventually be­ came a well-known political dissident among those who gener­ ally shared his concerns. Among what today is known as the \"Patriot Community,\" Gordon Kahl might properly be termed an American \"Refusenik.\" In the mid-1970's, Gordon Kahl, along with other \"Refuse­ niks,\" appeared on local television in Texas to share their beliefs with other Americans. The primary target of their criticism was the foundational basis of the American Income Tax system and its application.

For a tax system built on the very theory of voluntary compliance and self assessment, individuals such as Gordon Kahl posed a threat to the superstructure of the income tax system. B. PROSECUTION To stem the feared spreading noncompliance with the tax system, the IRS in 1977 targeted Gordon Kah1 officially as the leader of the \"tax rebellion.\" The IRS initiated what it deemed to be reasonable and necessary measures to shut down the developing tax rebellion. To do this, the Government initiated a very public Prosecution of Gordon Kah1 under IRS rules and laws which penalize NON-COMPLIANCE OR FAILURE TO FILE AN INCOME TAX RETURN. A co-leader in the tax rebellion with Gordon Kah1, Mr. W. M. Rinehart, was also prosecuted, convicted and subsequently died in prison. Both Kahl and Rinehart were prosecuted for and convicted of misde­ meanors for failure to file a tax return. Yorie Von Kahl was a teenager living at home at the time of his father's prosecution. Gordon Kahl was tried and convicted in 1978 in the United States District Court for the Western Division of Texas, on two misdemeanor counts of willful failure to file federal income tax returns. Specifically, Gordon Kah1 was prosecuted under 26 U.S.c. §7203, a misdemeanor carrying a maximum sentence of up to one year imprisonment and/or maximum fine of 10,000 dollars. IT IS MOST IMPORT ANT TO NOTE, however, that at the time of sentencing, Gordon Kahl was sentenced to one year imprisonment on Count I under the felony provision of 18 U.S.c. 4205(a). Additionally, Gordon Kahl's sentence on the second misdemeanor conviction was also a felony sentence. Specifically, Gordon Kahl was sentenced to \" ... probation for five years ... \" on Count II. This felony sentence itself violated 18 U.S.c. §3651. Section §3651 provides that the probation period can not exceed the maximum incarceration penalty al­ lowable. In this case the maximum incarceration sentence al­ lowed was one year. Statutorily the maximum probation that 351"},{"pageNumber":392,"pageContent":"352 • THE FRANKLIN COVER-UP the court should or could have imposed even under the felony provisions of 18 U.S.C §365l, was one year. The judicial abuse of Gordon Kahl, whether through accident or artifice-did not end with the sentencing errors. The special conditions of Kahl's parole were blatantly unconstitutional. Parole Condition One required not that Kahl divorce himself from illegal activity or groups participating in illegal activity, but rather from groups ADVOCATING the expression of free speech, all in contravention of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Condition two required that Kahl furnish copies of his tax return every year to his probation officer. This was a direct and clear contravention of the Revenue Laws of the United States. After conviction and sentencing, Gordon Kahl was immedi­ ately sent to the Medical Center for Federal Prisoners in Spring­ field, Missouri for psychiatric evaluation. There Gordon Kahl was found competent to engage in further proceedings. He was then released on bond pending appeal. C. PRISON In January of 1979, having exhausted his appeal rights, Gordon Kahl entered the Leavenworth Prison camp in Leaven­ worth, Kansas. Mr. Kahl was credited for time served at Spring­ field although he was given no credit towards probation for his exemplary behavior while awaiting appeal. No attempt by IRS was ever made to collect any alleged back taxes from Mr. Kahl until 1982, some four years later. When Gordon Kahl arrived at Leavenworth prison, his Fed­ erally Appointed Case Worker advised Mr. Kahl that his sen­ tence was illegal and that he was improperly sent to prison by the Sentencing Court. When the same case worker reported this fact to her supervisors, the Case Worker was instructed that if \"she wanted to keep her job to keep her mouth shut.\" Shortly after that, Gordon Kahl was offered release in exchange for extremely onerous terms of probation. Gordon Kahl refused, preferring to serve his time and be free when released."},{"pageNumber":393,"pageContent":"JUSTICE DEPT. MURDER OF GORDON KAHL • D. PROBA nON In August 1979, Gordon Kahl was released from Leaven­ worth Prison Camp. While being processed out of the camp he refused to sign the probation papers. After going home to the farm in North Dakota, Kahl's probation officer went out to the farm to see Kahl. Gordon Kahl told the probation officer that if it would make the probation officer happy Kahl would sign the papers. That was the only visit the Probation Officer made to Gordon Kahl's house. Subsequently, for a few months, the Probation Officer left the Probation Report papers in the Kahl mailbox. Then, the Probation Officer even quit doing that. For a substantial time following Gordon Kahl's release from prison, Gordon Kahl maintained a low profile and specifically declined invitations to attend and speak at public meetings. Consistent with the character of a dissident though, Gordon Kahl eventually renewed his denunciation and criticism of what he believed to be Unconstitutional Government actions and Judicial Corruption. Gordon Kahl was particularly outspoken about what he perceived to be the perfidy of the State and Federal judiciary in North Dakota and their links to Masonic organizations. Specifically, Kahl targeted Federal District Judges Paul Benson and Bruce VanSickle for his strongest criticism. They, consequently, took Kahl's vitriolic criticism as a personal affront, but, even more important, an affront to their judicial authority and the prestige of the position of federal judicial officers. E. SUMMONS On June 27, 1980, the U.S. District Court for the Western Division of Texas issued a summons for Gordon Kahl to appear before the Court to show cause why his probation should not be revoked. August 6, 1980, twelve months after Kahl's release from Leavenworth Prison Camp, Gordon Kahl was allegedly served the summons. It was further alleged that Gordon Kahl had advised the Deputy U.S. Marshal who had served the summons, that Kahl did not believe he was on probation and 353"},{"pageNumber":394,"pageContent":"354 • . THE FRANKLIN COVER·UP that consequently he had no intention of appearing at any show cause hearing. According to uncontroverted testimony at trial by Joan Kahl, the widow of Gordon Kahl, the signature on the summons was not that of Gordon Kahl. The sole reason given on the motion for revocation of probation was \"On or about May 20, 1980, the probationer has not abided by his Special Conditions of Probation that he be required to furnish the probation office with a copy of his income tax return each year at the appropriate time for filing a return.\" On September 23, 1980, a month after any legal probation period would have expired, the U.S. Attorney was given leave of the U.S. District Court of Texas to withdraw the motion to revoke the Defendant's probation. This was granted by order of the Court. It is believed that the reason for the withdrawal of the motion was that the condition of probation was illegal. It is also believed that fact was known to the Federal JUdiciary as well as the consequential fact that the order could not lawfully be enforced. F. THE WARRANT Six months later on March 30, 1981, the U.S. District Court for the Western Division of Texas issued a warrant for the arrest of Gordon Kahl. The supporting grounds on the petition requesting the warrant this time were, \"It is alleged that proba­ tioner is in violation of Condition No. 7- YOU SHALL RE­ PORT TO THE PROBATION OFFICER AS DIRECTED.\" (Emphasis in original). According to a United States Marshals' Service Field Report, the Texas judge who had issued the warrant wanted Gordon Kahl returned to Texas. The report also stated \"the JUDGE HAS SET THE BOND ON KAHL AT $1,000,000 CASH OR $75,000 + 10% CORPORATE SURETY.\" (Emphasis in original.) All this for an \"alleged\" misdemeanor probation violation. A probation which was itself null and void and violative of Federal Law. Remember, no new motion had ever been entered to revoke Gordon Kahl' s probation. And, of course, the original"},{"pageNumber":395,"pageContent":"JU,STICE DEPT. MURDER OF GORDON KAHL • probation imposed upon Gordon Kahl was illegal and therefore void, Any legal probation would have necessarily expired at the latest on August 19, 1980. Therefore, for anyone of at least three reasons, the action by Federal Marshals, led by United States Marshal for North Dakota, Ken Muir, on Feb. 13, 1983 resulting in the \"Shoot-out\", was knowingly initiated under a faulty warrant at best. The three reasons, summarized again, are: 1) Illegal 5-year FELONY probation sentence given for a Misdemeanor, thereby rendering the probation itself illegal; (2) Any legal maximum probation period allowed would necessarily have expired on Sept. 23, 1980, more than 2 years before the Shoot-out\" at Medina; (3) The supporting grounds for issuing the \"Alleged\" warrant under which U.S. Marshal Muir was operating on 13 Feb. 1983, were themselves defective legal grounds. Why? Because the Probation conditions imposed ordered Gordon Kahl to perform acts which the courts are constitutionally for­ bidden to order; namely, (I) First Amendment violation by prohibiting Gordon Kahl from \"Associating\" with groups \"ad­ vocating willful disobedience .... \" (2) Requiring Gordon Kahl to furnish copies of Kahl's future tax returns to the probation office, in violation of Federal Revenue Laws. G. UNITED STATES MARSHAL, HAROLD \"BUD\" WARREN Harold \"Bud\" Warren was the United States Marshal for North Dakota on March 30th, 1981, when the so called \"Misde­ meanor Arrest Warrant\" for \"Probation Violation\" arrived at the U.S. Marshal's Office in Fargo, North Dakota. Warren immediately reacted by personally traveling to Carrington, North Dakota where Warren was advised Gordon Kahl might be located. Based on information from federal officials he had dealt with, Warren went there expecting to find a fugitive in hiding. What Warren by his own admission found was a friendly, smiling farmer leaning against the front of a church. Gordon Kahl had attended church and was waiting for Joan Kahl, his wife, to join him. A few days later, Marshal Warren made arrangements to 355"},{"pageNumber":396,"pageContent":"356 • THE FRANKLIN COVER·UP meet personally with Gordon Kahl. He wanted to discuss the \"Misdemeanor Warrant\" and resolve the situation. Warren went unarmed, as was Gordon Kahl. Warren advised Gordon Kahl of the existence of the warrant and gave Gordon Kahl thirty days to try and straighten out the situation with the warrant. Marshal Warren told Mr. Kahl, after thirty days he, Warren, would have to take action to arrest him, Kahl. During the 30 day moratorium Marshal Warren had given to Gordon Kahl to clear up the misdemeanor Warrant, Warren himself was removed from office. Warren's removal from office was itself a highly charged political maneuver. Deputy U.S. Marshal, Ken Muir, was quickly installed as United States Marshal for North Dakota. Marshal Warren himself had incurred the wrath and animos­ ity of the political king-makers in North Dakota politics by 1981. His decision to accommodate Gordon Kah1 and attempt to amicably resolve the issue of the Arrest Warrant was not well received. Gordon Kahl's very presence in North Dakota had become a significant embarrassment and irritant to the political system and economic power structure. Gordon Kahl was loud and outspoken in his criticism of the political power structure. He blamed the same political and economic power structure for an almost total collapse of the agricultural econ­ omy in North Dakota which was occurring in the early 1980's as part of the so called \"Farm Crisis.\" H. A NEW U.S. MARSHAL FOR NORTH DAKOTA In 1981 Ronald Reagan replaced Jimmy Carter in the White House. The change in presidential administrations afforded the North Dakota power brokers and politicians the opportunity to appoint a U.S. Marshal who promised to rid the system of the irritating Gordon Kahl. In the person of U.S. Deputy Marshal Ken Muir, was the culmination of all their desires. At the request and behest of Judges Benson and VanSickle, Senator Mark Andrews of North Dakota was induced to recommend to President Reagan that Deputy Marshal Ken Muir be given the appointment as U.S. Marshal for North Dakota and that U.S. Marshal \"Bud\" Warren be removed from his position as"},{"pageNumber":397,"pageContent":"DEPT. MURDER OF GORDON KAHL • U.S. Marshal. As is the custom, President Ronald Reagan then nominated Deputy U.S. Marshal, Ken Muir, for the position of U.S. Marshal for North Dakota and the U.S. Senate routinely approved the nomination. With the transfer of office from Warren to Muir, new U.S. Marshal Ken Muir specifically refused former Marshal War­ ren's offer of information and guidance and assistance in resolv­ ing the Gordon Kahl affair. Ken Muir specifically told out­ going Marshal Warren \"When you were Marshal you did it your way, (handling Kahl) now we do it my way.\" After failed attempts by Marshal Muir to apprehend Gordon Kahl-keystone cop type attempts which Kahl himself appar­ ently was never even aware of-now Deputy U.S. Marshal Warren again contacted U.S. Marshal Muir. Deputy Marshal Warren offered to give Marshal Muir what information Warren had learned about Gordon Kahl. Muir responded to Warren's contact and offer by advising Warren that, \"No need existed any more for assistance from Warren or concern about Gordon Kahl because Muir had been advised by u.s. Marshals' Service Deputy Director Toomey in Washington D.C., ... to file the Gordon Kahl warrant away and not spend anymore time or manpower on it.' \" That was in 1981. I. LIVING IN THE OPEN In 1982 the dissident Gordon Kahl freely roamed the country. He attended political meetings and personally, publicly and openly addressed these gatherings giving his strong opinions on constitutional issues such as gun control, income taxes, abortion, land use planning and Kahl's belief about excessive Masonic influence. Contrary to claims made by the Federal Government Gordon Kahl went about his business in the light of day. In the summer of 1982 Gordon Kahl's wife, Joan, and a neighbor friend named Herman Widiker went to the IRS office in Fargo, North Dakota, and offered to pay Gordon's Kahl's tax bill. The IRS told Joan Kahl and Herman Widiker that the IRS couldn't tell Mrs. Kahl and Mr. Widiker how much Gordon Kahl owed because the IRS didn't know. Gordon Kahl at­ 357"},{"pageNumber":398,"pageContent":"358 • THE FRANKLIN COVER·UP tempted to file a Temporary Restraining Order in the Bismarck Federal District Court to halt the sale of his farmland by the IRS. The Clerk of the Federal District Court actually accepted the restraining order documents, but, unknown to Kahl, actually refused to file Gordon Kahl' s petition and complaint for a temporary restraining order. This refusal to file was unknown to Gordon Kahl. Instead of advising Kahl of the refusal, the court clerk personally turned Kahl's paperwork over to U.S. District Court Judge Bruce Van Sickle and notified the U.S. Marshals Service. Judge Van Sickle was then personally contacted by Deputy U.S. Marshal Bob Cheshire, who would later be killed at the shoot-out February 13, 1983 at Medina, North Dakota. Deputy Marshal Cheshire advised Judge Van Sickle in the fall of 1982, many months before the 1983 shoot out, that Gordon Kahl was a fugitive and the Marshal apparently suggested therefore that the Clerk should not file the motion. One thing is for sure: That is, Gordon Kahl sure did not know he was a fugitive in 1982. For whatever reasons, apparently based on instructions from U.S. District Judge Van Sickle, Gordon Kahl's complaint and petition for temporary restraining order were never filed. This was never known to Gordon Kahl nor was he ever informed of this refusal action. In November of 1982 the IRS attempted to sell Gordon Kahl's farm. That effort failed when no one would bid on the farm, so the IRS bought the farm itself. Of particular interest during the early 1980's, was the prob­ lem farmers had remaining solvent. So did the banks that were financing them. Record numbers of farms and farmers were in foreclosure. In such an environment of despair and economic upheaval, many farmers saw themselves as victims of a political and economic system gone berserk. Seeing themselves as twentieth century patriots, many farm­ ers proposed the return to their perception of what constitution­ ally mandated government should be as the essential immediate and long term solution to the farm problem. Harkening back to their patriot heritage and the \"spirit of 1776\" these citizens openly exercised their right to keep and bear arms, to assemble"},{"pageNumber":399,"pageContent":"JUSTICE DEPT. MURDER OF GORDON KAHL • and speak out against the government. The typical farmer/ patriot was also a hunter. But, bottom-line, they were simply citizens concerned about losing their farms and their per­ sonal safety. J. ALL POINTS BULLETIN During the week of February 6, 1983, an All Points Bulletin (APB) was disseminated by Law Enforcement Officials in North Dakota through their state law enforcement communica­ tions network, State Radio. The APB's contents were factually inaccurate. The APB originated from a confidential source in Carrington, North Dakota. It described Gordon Kahl and an­ other man as carrying machine guns and driving to Fessenden, North Dakota to kill the Sheriff. The car Kahl was allegedly driving was in the possession of some one else that day. Need­ less to say Kahl and his friend did not show up to shoot the sheriff. It now appears that the real purpose of the APB was not informational but was designed to provoke or create a violent confrontation between Gordon Kahl and Law Enforcement. By eliminating Gordon Kahl it was hoped to quash the emerging tax rebellion. This picture only emerges looking backwards with new factual data and documentation available now and not available in the heat of the 1983 Medina shoot-out and the emotionally and politically charged trials that followed. III. EVENTS AT MEDINA, NORTH DAKOTA, FEBRUARY 13, 1983 On Sunday morning, February 13, 1983, Gordon Kahl, his wife Joan and son Yorie traveled from their farm near Heaton, North Dakota, to Medina to attend a meeting of dissidents, tax protesters and financially troubled farmers. They took their friend Scott Faul with them. Scott Faul suggested that Yorie Kahl bring Yorie's rifle in case they saw some rabbits. Yorie Kahl ran back in the house and retrieved his Ruger Mini-14. Gordon, Joan and Yorie Kahl and Scott Faul then left for Medina. Along the way they shot a rabbit to feed to the dog. 359"},{"pageNumber":400,"pageContent":"360 • THE FRANKLIN COVER·UP A. POLICE SURVEILLANCE Early that afternoon of Feb. 13, 1983, Bradley Kapp, the Deputy Sheriff of Stutzman County, North Dakota, contacted State Radio (law enforcement network). Deputy Kapp told the law enforcement radio network that the rumored meeting of the tax protesters/dissidents was underway in Medina, North Dakota at the Medina Medical Clinic and that Gordon Kahl himself was physically present at the meeting. State Radio immediately relayed the message to the U.S. Marshals' Service for North Dakota. The Marshals' service immediately contacted U.S. Marshal Ken Muir at his home and advised him of the meeting and Kahl's presence. U.S. Marshal Muir and Deputy U.S. Marshal Carl Wigglesworth immediately left Fargo headed for Medina. At Medina, Muir and Wigglesworth met up with Deputy U.S. Marshals Cheshire and Hopson who had come from Bismarck, North Dakota. At Medina Muir, Wigglesworth, Cheshire and Hopson enlisted the help of another local law enforcement officer, Medina City Policeman, Steven Schnabel. Under the pretense of executing the very warrant that Mar­ shal Muir had specifically been instructed from higher authori­ ties to ignore and not waste further resources attempting to serve, the Marshals set up a roadblock in the town of Medina at the railroad crossing. Darrell Graf, the Police Chief of Medina, became aware of the Marshals' plans and demanded that the roadblock be moved out of town. Unable to convince the Mar­ shals to abandon their ill conceived plan, Chief Graf persuaded Marshal Muir & the others with him to move their road-block out of town into the countryside north of Medina. While all of these preparations were being made, the meeting was winding up at the Medina Medical Clinic. As the meeting goers were walking out they noticed someone watching the clinic. Dr. Martin, the operator of the clinic said, \"That's just Brad Kapp (Stutzman Co. Deputy Sheriff) being Brad. He does stuff like that.\" David Broer decided to call Darrell Graf, the Medina Police Chief about it. Chief Graf told David Broer about the APB that had been issued a few days before, previously described above."},{"pageNumber":401,"pageContent":"JUSTICE DEPT. MURDER OF GORDON KAHL • The car in the APB matched Scott Faul's. This troubled Scott Faul because the day the APB was supposedly generated, his wife Shauna had driven the car to Harvey to do laundry. None of the Kahl or Faul groups present could think of any valid reason for the issuance of a legitimate warrant, especially involving Scott's car. Someone said to Gordon, Joan and Yorie Kahl, \"It looks like you're being set up.\" This disturbed Joan Kahl, but Gordon Kahl reassured her that nothing was going on that he knew of. Not knowing what to think about the APB, and the anony­ mous comment about a setup, Yorie Kahl suggested and then insisted that Yorie Kahl and his Father Gordon Kahl, trade coats and hats. Yorie Kahl and Joan Kahl accompanied by Vern Wegner and Scott Faul, got in Gordon Kahl's Chrysler station wagon. Gordon Kahl and David Broer got in David Broer's car so they could talk on the way to Gordon Kahl's home. The two vehicles left the Medina Clinic and headed north for the Kahl home. They were totally unaware of the presence of the Marshals or the ambush the Marshals had planned for them. B. PUBLIC SAFETY Based on discussion and information between himself and the Marshals that afternoon of Feb. 13, 1983, Chief Graf was convinced that the Marshals planned a violent ambush and confrontation. He was certain of the upcoming violence planned by the Marshals. So certain was GRAF of the impending danger and a certain shoot out or execution of the Dissident Kahl and Kahl's party by the Marshals, that he, GRAF, took extraordi­ nary measures to minimize the damage to the town of Medina and its citizens.

They re­ counted that Chief Graf told them \"there was going to be a shoot out and this time the police were in the wrong.\" Two other citizens who had attended the meeting at the Medina Clinic where Gordon Kahl was present were also prevented by Chief Graf from entering the ambush fire zone. Chief Graf told them, \"We are going to try to save at least Dave's [Broer] life.\" Other people at the scene also testified that Graf told them \"there is a tax protester up there and now they are going to shoot him. \" The Kahl entourage first saw the roadblock ahead of them on a hilltop a mile north of Medina as they topped a hill on the edge of town. Still unaware that they were the intended targets of the road block they pulled into the first driveway they could to turn around. Immediately, the Kahl's exit route from the areas was blocked by a Dodge Ramcharger which had followed the Kahl vehicles out of Medina. In the Ramcharger were Deputy U.S. Marshals Cheshire and Hopson, and Stutsman County Deputy Sheriff Brad Kapp. In the roadblock ahead of the Kahls' vehicles were U.S. Marshal for North Dakota, Ken Muir, Deputy U.S. Marshal Carl Wigglesworth and Medina City policeman Steven Schnabel. After the Marshals had cut off all the Kahl vehicles' retreat routes from the planned ambush zone, the Marshals jumped out of their unmarked vehicles and aimed their weapons at the Kahl group. None of the law enforcement officers at the scene were in uniform. Deputy Marshal Cheshire even told Deputy Marshal Hopson to take off his badge. Once out of their cars and with their weapons aimed directly ut the Kahl group. the Marshals began yelling \", .. we're going to blow your (Kahl group) goddamn heads off,\" and \"you are going to die.\""},{"pageNumber":403,"pageContent":"JUSTICE DEPT. MURDER OF GORDON KAHL • Gordon KaW, Yorie Kahl and Scott Faul then got out of their cars and began to separate from each other. None of the Marshals knew who Gordon Kahl was in the group or what Gordon Kahl looked like. Relying ONLY on the description provided by Deputy Kapp who had seen Gordon Kahl attending the meeting in Medina, the Marshals directed their shouts, their attentions, their weapons DIRECTLY AT YORIE KAHL WHO, AS YOU WILL RECALL, WAS WEARING HIS FA­ THER GORDON'S COAT AND HAT. This stand-off continued for a period of time that is still disputed ranging from a minute to as many as 13 minutes. Then U.S. Marshal Ken Muir fired the first shot ofthe shoot­ out. Firing his .38 Special revolver at Yorie Kahl Marshal Muir hit YORIE KAHL in the grip of the pistol Yorie was wearing in his shoulder holster. As Yorie Kahl fell backwards from being hit the \"Ruger mini-14 ranch rifle\" Yorie Kahl was carrying discharged twice. Yorie Kahl was then shot in the abdominal region by Deputy Brad Kapp with two shotgun blasts. Marshal Muir himself-rated as one of the top ten pistol shots in the United States of America-then fired three more times hitting Yorie Kahl repeatedly with his fire. During the balance of the gun battle, Victim Yorie Kahllay on the ground with his near fatal wounds. Kahl friend and traveling companion Scott Faul attempted to retreat from the fire zone but Faul's escape was cut off by an unknown but armed assailant who turned out to be U.S. Deputy Marshal Wigglesworth. With his escape cut off, Scott Faul retreated and headed back towards where Yorie Kahllay wounded on the ground. At this time, Scott Faul also came under fire from the Marshals. In response to being fired upon, Scott Faul returned fire in the direction of the Ramcharger. Seeing his son Yorie repeatedly shot and believing Yorie to be dead, Gordon Kahl himself opened fire on the Marshals, Deputy Kapp and Officer Schnabel. Marshal Muir and Deputy Marshals Cheshire and Hopson quickly succumbed to the deadly volley of fire laid down by the veteran aerial gunner Gordon Kahl.

Gordon then went over to the Ramcharger and put two more rounds into Deputy Cheshire. By the time Scott Faul reached the wounded Yorie Kahl, the shooting had stopped. Scott Faul then assisted Yorie Kahl into a vehicle and headed into Medina to the Medical Clinic. The moment the shooting had stopped, and right on schedule, ambulances and rescue personnel began arriving. The injured were taken directly to the Medina Clinic where Dr. Martin began treating them and preparing the critically wounded for transportation to the Hospital in Jamestown, North Dakota. Marshal Hopson and Yorie Kahl underwent emergency surgery for their wounds. Hopson was disabled from the effects of his head wound, but would recover sufficiently to testify in the rush to judgment called a trial 85 days later. David Broer, Vern Wegner and Scott Faul all surrendered within a day. Joan Kahl was arrested along with Yorie Kahl at the Jamestown Hospital. Gordon Kahl remained at large for four months and became the center of what was officially called by U.S. Marshals the \"largest manhunt in American History.\" IV. THE RUSH TO JUDGMENT Eighty-five days after the events at Medina and fifty-nine days after the Grand Jury returned an indictment, trial began in U.S. District Court for North Dakota, Southeastern Division. The trial was held before District Judge Paul Benson in Fargo and prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Lynn Crooks and Dennis Fisher. The details of the trial and the issues there under attack are presented in more detail in the Motion to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Sentence. It suffices here to generally list the defects in what was passed off as a trial in Fargo, North Dakota thirteen years ago.

But for the illegal actions of the United States Government in the prosecution of the Petitioner, and the lack of a fair and impartial Judiciary, the Petitioner could have proved his innocence. The Petitioner, Yorie Von Kahl: A. Was denied counsel and held incommunicado for ten days while he was interrogated by federal and state law enforce­ ment agents. B. Was prejudiced by denial of access to the Petitioner by available counsel and private investigative services being offered during the above ten day period. C.

Potential defense witnesses were hindered or prevented from testifying as a result of threats, intimidation and subterfuge by government officials. I. There was improper contact with the jury by U.S. Deputy Marshal Carl Wigglesworth, a victim in the shooting incident. J.

For sure, the cumulative effects combined to deny the Petition­ er's right to a fair and impartial trial and his rights to due process of law. From the beginning of the proceedings the Defendants tried to have Judge Paul Benson removed from the case. Judge Benson was the Masonic brother and sponsor of the deceased Marshal Muir. The defendants were well aware of the animus Judge Benson bore for any who would dare to defend them­ selves against Government agents. Seven years earlier in an­ other proceeding involving confrontations between citizens and 365"},{"pageNumber":406,"pageContent":"366 • THE FRANKLIN COVER-UP government agents at a place called WOUNDED KNEE, the team of Benson and Crooks had gained similar attention for their handling of the Leonard Peltier case. From the start the push was on to rush the trial and prejudice the Defendants. Prior to trial there was a tremendous amount of negative pretrial publicity and a deliberate disinformation campaign carried out by the Government while a unilateral gag order was being enforced on the Defense. The biasing effect this had on the jury pool was demonstrated during jury selection. There was a presumption of bias in the jury and it was proven after trial there was actual bias. One juror willfully gave deceitful answers to specific ques­ tions during voir dire relative to the juror's personal relationship with the prosecutor, Mr. Crooks. Incredibly, the impaneled jury was guarded and even enter­ tained by U.S. Marshals service who were the victims and clearly viewed themselves as a whole as the victims of the shoot out with the Defendants. Marshal Wigglesworth, himself a participant in the Medina Shoot-out and one of the assault victims of the shoot-out, engaged with the other Marshals guarding the Jury in recreational activities with the jury members. When such conduct was reported to Presiding Judge Benson, the Judge responded by simply brushing aside the incidents, refusing to hold a hearing on the matter, and insuring that the event was not recorded when Judge Benson met in chambers to discuss Wigglesworth's jury contact incidents with a select portion of the attorneys defending in the case.

This was simply one more example of Sogard's advo­ cacy deficiency. Besides being prejudiced by ineffective assistance of coun­ sel, Yorie Kahl was denied counsel prior to the appointment of Warren Sogard. Attorney Jerry Lafountain and private inves­ tigator-paralegal Gary Fredricks from Montana traveled to Jamestown, North Dakota to offer their services to Yorie Kahl and the other Defendants. Lafountain and Fredricks made themselves available to the family but they were denied access to the Defendants including Yorie Kahl who was still in the hospital recovering from his wounds. For ten days Yorie Kahl was prevented from obtaining counselor contacting anyone, including Jerry LaFountain, that could or would provide or obtain counsel for him. Assistant United States Attorney Lynn Crooks, lead prosecutor on the case, was quoted after trial saying \"We did everything in our power to make sure that they did not wind up having tax protester lawyers.\" When Jerry LaFountain and Gary Fredricks arrived in Mon­ tana they were harassed, intimidated and threatened by federal and local law enforcement officers. The motel room and car of the attorney and investigator were bugged. Everywhere La­ Fountain and Fredricks went they were followed by a detach­ ment of law enforcement. Lafountain and Fredricks were not allowed in the area of the shooting incident to investigate. They went to interview Dave Broer's Wife, Joanne Broer, and the marshals followed them there. The legal team then departed the Broer residence to see Shauna Faul, wife of Defendant Scott Faul. While LaFountain and Fredricks were driving on the interstate and no one else was on the highway, they came upon a road block and were then blocked from behind by U.S. Marshals. The Marshals searched LaFountain, Fredricks and the car including LaFountain's legal papers. Another incident involving Mr. Lafountain and Mr. Fred­ ricks was staged for their benefit. Lafountain and Fredricks 367"},{"pageNumber":408,"pageContent":"368 • THE FRANKLIN COVER·UP went to the Ramada Inn in Jamestown one night for entertain­ ment. The place was full of U.S. Marshals. The Marshals dragged a young woman outside and stripped half of her clothes off. This happened within the view of LaFountain and Fredricks who were standing inside the lobby of the hotel watching through the window. LaFountain and Fredricks did not go out to help the woman fearing the incident was a set up to charge LaFountain and Fredricks with rape and assault. The half nude woman the Marshals were assaulting came in screaming at the Marshals. Jerry LaFountain went to the front desk to call the police and the female desk clerk was herself, a U.S. Marshal. Jerry LaFountain then called a Federal judge to advise him of what was happening to insure the safety of LaFountain and Fredricks. The Marshals later harassed LaFountain and Fred­ ricks about it. The Marshals told LaFountain and Fredricks the U.S. Marshals didn't like LaFountain and Fredricks calling \"their\" judges. It was clear to LaFountain and Fredricks that if they went outside they would be arrested or shot for rape. Gary Fredricks said that they were so scared at one point they couldn't sleep for 50 hours. LaFountain and Fredricks ultimately got so scared they decided to go back home. LaFoun­ tain and Fredricks agreed together not to do or say anything because they feared for their own lives and those of their family. The first testimony in the Government's case was not from witnesses with actual knowledge relevant to the case or from experts. The first testimony was from the grieving widows of the dead marshals presenting studio photos of their husbands and telling of their children. There was no probative value to their testimony whatever. The only purpose served was to gamer sympathy with the jury and create animosity and preju­ dice against the Defendants. The government withheld exculpatory evidence from the defense that would have substantially bolstered the Petitioner's affirmative defense.

MURDER OF GORDON KAHL • who could have provided exculpatory evidence of the events of February 13, 1983 as well as knowledge of the plan by the U.S. Marshals to kill Gordon Kahl. The APB upon which the Marshals relied was inaccurate and based on false information provided by a confidential informant in Carrington, North Da­ kota, whose name was withheld from Defendants. Additionally, it is now known that a key undercover agent named Mike Phillips from Ashley, North Dakota, who was a principal in­ volved in helping orchestrate the Shoot Out, was concealed from the Defendants at the trial stage. The existence of the Carrington informant who generated the suspicious APB was also improperly concealed from defendants at trial. Potential defense witnesses were hindered or prevented from testifying as a result of threats, intimidation and subterfuge by government officials. The intimidating presence oflaw enforce­ ment officers following LaFountain and Fredricks as they went to interview witnesses was very effective. An unusual number of Government witnesses testified contrary to statements and reports made shortly after the incident and subsequently sup­ plied to defense. Especially interesting is the case of Defense witnesses Mark and Carol Lanenga. After the Lanengas finished testifying at trial and had been excused by the Court an FBI agent came up to Carol Lenenga and said \"We're not done with you yet.\" This upset Mrs. Lanenga as well it should have. A few months after trial the Lanengas heard from the IRS that they were being audited. The Lanengas thought it was an unusual coincidence though IRS said it was routine. When the Lanengas were audited again within a few months, it was no coincidence. Another witness called by the defense was U.S. Deputy Marshal Bud Warren. Deputy Warren was also dunned by IRS after testifying too truthfully for the defense. After going through the audit he also received a refund. Incidents of prosecutorial misconduct were condoned and sometimes defended by Judge Benson. During cross examina­ tion of Government witness Lonny Reuer by defense counsel Mr. Ramlo, several people in the courtroom including jurors, defendants and defense counsel observed the following: (i) Mr. 369"},{"pageNumber":410,"pageContent":"370 • . THE FRANKLIN COVER-UP Ramlo would ask Mr. Reuer a question; (ii) the witness, Mr. Reuer, would then tum his head to look at the prosecution table; (iii) Mr. Crooks would then shake his head up and down or side to side; (iv) Mr. Reuer would then tum his head back to face Mr. Ramlo and answer the question. This happened several times until Mr. Ramlo noticed others in the courtroom following this action. He then asked the witness \"When Mr. Crooks shakes his head at you like that, is that a signal to answer one way or another?\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Dennis Fisher objected, and Judge Benson immediately came to the defense of Mr. Crooks. \"I've watched Mr. Crooks try cases for 12 Years ... The question is uncalled for.\" He further chastised Mr. Ramlo for suggesting such a thing totally ignoring that perhaps what Mr. Ramlo said was true. Noting the futility of pressing the issue, Mr. Ramlo dropped it, asked a token question of the witness and abandoned cross examination. On Appeal the majority opinion did not address some of the issues appealed. After saying 28 U.S.c. §144 and 455 are similar and that it would consider them together the Court ignored §455. The Court was also disingenuous in the way it dealt with the issue of biased prospective jurors. The Court misconstrued the fact that fifty percent of the prospective jurors that were actually questioned were removed for cause arising from partiality. Judge Lay in a footnote to his dissent stated, \"The Majorities statement that only 27% of the jurors attributed their partiality to media coverage is misleading.\" United States v. Faul, et al., 748 F.2d at 1231 fn. 8. It should not matter what their partiality was attributable to, just that they were partial. The details of the grounds for the motion under §2255 appear in the motion itself. One thing is certain. As Chief Judge Lay wrote in his dissent, \"The record amply demonstrates the defendants did not and could not receive a fair trial in the District of North Dakota.\" United States v. Faul, et al., §748 F.2d at 1223.

On February 25, 1983, Gordon Kahl wrote out an affidavit witnessed by Leonard Ginter re­ counting the events of the shooting incident in Medina, North Dakota on February 13, 1983. Gordon Kahl expressed that if he was discovered he would not be given a chance to surrender before being killed. Because he expected to be murdered Gor­ don Kahl wrote out the affidavit to preserve details of the previous events so that the truth could eventually be made known. For thirteen years these original documents, made in contemplation of impending death, have been hidden. Defense attorney for Yorie Kahl has now obtained this original sworn affidavit of Gordon Kahl. In these documents Gordon Kahl details what actually happened at the Medina shoot out February 13,1983. These documents clearly exonerate Yorie Kahl. Cop­ ies of these documents were not allowed to be admitted into evidence in the original trial because they were not the originals. About the middle of April, 1983, Bill Wade had heard that the FBI was closing in on Gordon Kahl so Leonard Ginter took Gordon Kahl to the house of Art Russell. Gordon Kahl stayed at the Russell house until Leonard Ginter brought him back to the Ginter's house the last part of May, 1983. On June 2, 1983 Gordon Kahllearned of the conviction of his son Yorie Von Kahl. Gordon Kahl expressed to Leonard Ginter his desire to surrender to federal authorities to help his son. The next day, June 3, 1983, Leonard Ginter left the house without explanation at 5:15 P.M. and started driving up the driveway when he was seized by FBI Special Agent James Blassingame. Gordon Kahl was seated at the kitchen table eating dinner when Leonard Ginter left. At 5:30 p.m. the news was just coming on and Gordon was eating dinner and watching for news of his son Yorie Kahl. Norma Ginter heard a noise outside the house and went to look out the door. She was grabbed by Sheriff Gene Mathews. Norma Ginter was told to be quiet, handcuffed and taken around the corner of the house next to her husband Leonard Ginter. Sheriff Mathews left Leonard and Norma Ginter with Special 371"},{"pageNumber":412,"pageContent":"372 • THE FRANKLIN COVER·UP Agent Blassingame while Sheriff Mathews and Deputy U.S. Marshal Hall entered the house armed with pistols. State Police Investigator Ed Fitzpatrick stayed outside armed with a shot­ gun. Sheriff Mathews stepped through the kitchen doorway undetected by Gordon Kahl. Sheriff Mathews then shot Gordon Kahl in the back of the head with Mathews's .41 Magnum revolver. This single shot in the house was followed by four or five shotgun blasts directed into the house through the kitchen window by State Police Investigator Fitzpatrick. Sheriff Ma­ thews was hit by the shotgun pellets fired by Fitzpatrick while he was standing outside on the patio. This all transpired in less than a few minutes. Sheriff Mathews remained in the house twenty to forty minutes after that. The Ginters were then moved about 50 feet west of the house and pushed down to the ground. FBI agent David King then pointed a gun at Leonard Ginter and said, \"I'm going to kill you, son of a bitch,\" several times. About ten minutes later the Ginters were taken a little bit further west to where Leonard had previously removed a large rock. The various law enforce­ ment personnel were continuously shooting into the house this whole time. Leonard and Norma Ginter were then moved to the road up the hill and handcuffed to a police car about 250 feet from the house. Immediately after the initial shots were fired, Special Agent Blassingame went to Leonard Ginter and asked him \"was Gordon Kahl clean shaven?\" Leonard Ginter answered \"the man at my house was clean shaven.\" Agent Blassingame then immediately went back to the house. At about 6:00 PM an unidentified law enforcement officer positioned up the hill southwest of the house started shooting. Leonard Ginter said two of the many shots from this shooter sounded similar to the sound made when bullets hit a deer. This sound came from the comer of the garage. At this time different people started hollering that Sheriff Gene Mathews had been shot.

This was from Mathews being shot while Mathews was inside the house. This shot was from a shotgun fired by State Police Investigator Fitzpatrick through the glass of the kitchen window. In response to Sheriff Mathews being shot a police car then came down the hill on the driveway to assist him. The car was driven to the comer of the house where Mathews had been shot. Within only a minute or two the police car came back up the road past where Norma and Leonard Ginter were now handcuffed to a police car. The car went right by Leonard Ginter and Ginter could see Sheriff Gene Mathews alone in the back seat. Mathews appeared to be dead and was receiving no attention. This was about ten or fifteen minutes after six o'clock p.m., forty minutes after Gordon Kahl had been shot and killed. Immediately after Leonard Ginter saw Sheriff Mathews be­ ing taken away, Ginter heard a radio transmission from the police car he was handcuffed to. The broadcast said that Bill Wade had been shot. The law enforcement officers obviously did not know who had actually been killed in the house, but the broadcast confirmed the man in the house was dead. Bill Wade's family was called by people listening to police scanners to see if Bill Wade was dead. Bill Wade answered the phone and advised the caller he, Wade, had not been shot. Around eight o'clock p.m. Leonard and Norma Ginter saw Tom Lee, the City of Ravenden Marshal, with two five gallon cans of fuel. Lee stopped right behind the police car the Ginters were still handcuffed to and began stirring the contents of the cans. Lee then went on to the roof of the house and poured the contents of the cans down a roof vent. The fuel was then ignited by dropping smoke grenades and tear gas canisters into the vent. Mr. Lee testified by sworn affidavit that he was ordered to do this by FBI agents at the scene. The Ginters were then taken up the road to the top of the hill.

The evidence suggests that law enforcement officers at the scene knew Gordon Kahl was dead before fire was set. Gordon Kahl's body was found in front of a large picture window, easily visible to the SWAT Team from outside of the house. Later independent investigation would show accelerant pour points were found all over the house, in corners, on the body as well as under the roof vents where accelerants were admitted to have been poured. The body was definitely burned by materi­ als not found in the house. The temperature required to burn human bones is higher than what could be attained by what was in the house or even by gasoline. Neither would 10 gallons of fuel poured down the roof vents have been enough to reach the body where the body was or burn the body to the extent it was. Considering the accelerants found on the corpse at autopsy, fuel practically had to have been poured directly on the body. The feet and one hand of Kahl' s body were either completely burned off or cut off. Part of a foot was later found suggesting that the hand and feet had been cut off. Whichever the case, the fire was hot, it was deliberately set, and it destroyed a lot of evidence. CONCLUSION As stated in the foreword of this paper this case is one of an unfortunate chain of events complicated by compounding errors. The negligent manner in which the original sentencing of Gordon Kahl was mishandled served to prove beyond any reasonable doubt, in Gordon Kahl' s mind, the duplicity of the Federal Government and its court system in which he was selectively prosecuted. To Gordon Kahl, the Man whom the Media and Government described as paranoid fanatic, this treat­ ment confirmed Gordon Kahl' s belief that the courts were corrupt and validated his deeply held conviction that the U.S. Government was acting as an outlaw government. Whether it was mere negligence or by design, the illegal warrant used to give color of law to the actions of the U.S. Marshals at Medina, North Dakota, was nothing less than a"},{"pageNumber":415,"pageContent":"JUSTICE DEPT. MURDER OF GORDON KAHL • license to kill. The illegality of the outrageous actions of the Government in provoking the incident at Medina is unconscion­ able and inexcusable. The resultant proceeding was mischaracterized as resem­ bling a trial. Whether it was the defective voir dire, improper contact and influence with the jury by the Marshal's service and a victim-witness, prosecutorial misconduct, intimidation of witnesses and legal counsel, ineffective assistance of counsel, or an assassination plot by certain government officials, any one of these issues was a gross violation of the Petitioner's right to due process of law. Anyone should be enough to warrant a reversal of the verdict. The cumulative effect of other infringements of the Petitioner's rights combined to unfairly prejudice him. The major individual issues of this case, are outrageous. It is for the prevention of this kind of government misconduct and persecution of political dissidents that constitu­ tional protections were memorialized in the Bill of Rights. The fiery Arkansas chapter of this saga is bizarre to say the least. Gordon Kahl was never given a chance to surrender and the officers involved did not make any attempt to subdue Kahl when they had the chance to. The cloud of suspicion that hangs over the true identity of the burned corpse found in the Ginter house may never dissipate. The Arkansas chapter of this saga would be the last were it not for the continued unconstitutional and unjust incarceration of Yorie Kahl and Scott Faul. For thirteen years the Petitioner and Scott Faul have been model prisoners demonstrating every day they are not typical criminals, but political prisoners. The whole Kahl affair and the injustice of it can be identified as the defining moment in American history that spawned the constitutionalist, patriot, militia movement. The events leading up to Medina and following were an injustice resembling and predating the events at Ruby Ridge, Idaho in August 1992. The conduct and atmosphere of the trial of the Medina defendants is typified by the answers received by members of the United States Senate Judiciary Committee hearings on Ruby Ridge in 1995.

The case of Yorie and Gordon Kahl, as well as the broader militia movement, were subjects I frequently discussed with Bill Colby. In fact, I was surprised by his intense interest in the whole matter. Just two weeks before he died, Bill gave me some very pointed advice on the matter."},{"pageNumber":417,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 25 IN MEMORIAM BILL COLBY On April 27, 1996, my dear friend and mentor, former Central Intelligence Agency director, William Colby, disappeared, sup­ posedly while boating on the eastern shore of Maryland. Ten days later, his body was fished out of the water, less than a mile from his weekend home. His death was pronounced an accident, probably caused by a heart attack, resulting in his falling into the river and drowning. Bill's sudden, and tragic death, prompts me to recount some features of our 25-year relationship, which bear directly on the events under discussion in this book. They will hopefully shed further light on his amazing life, and, perhaps, also on the circumstances surround­ ing his most untimely death. Bill Colby was one of the pivotal figures in unearthing the Franklin scandal. Without his persis­ tent support and guidance, this book would have never been written. More than once, I was determined to put Franklin behind me, and write it off as a horrible experience that I could do nothing about. Often, I would ask myself, \"Why should I have any responsibility to do something, when others in positions of power and government responsibility would do nothing?\" I know that Senator Loran Schmit, the head of the Nebraska State Senate's Franklin investigating committee, felt the same way. I told Bill one time: \"I have done all I can do, and have been burned badly-financially and credibility-wise-and, I am sure, politically. I think it's time to just let it drop.\" It was at those times that Bill Colby kept encouraging me (and Senator Schmit), kept pushing us, almost forcing us to 377"},{"pageNumber":418,"pageContent":"• • • • THE FRANKLIN COVER-UP keep going, and to keep the press apprised. To quote his exact words, \"This case is so much bigger than you think. It goes to the very highest levels; we have to keep pulling the strings.\" His idea was not to investigate further-which he repeatedly warned me could be very dangerous-as to shine the sharp glare of publicity onto what had already been discovered, to create the possibility of a real investigation. Bill always promised that he would help me as much as possible, behind the scenes and, if necessary, publicly. And, Bill always delivered. When the Discovery Channel program, Conspiracy of Si­ lence, was being prepared, the British investigative team in­ sisted that they would not go forward on the program unless they had the on-camera personal interview, and verification of Bill Colby himself, that John DeCamp was reporting the truth with respect to Franklin, and with respect to this book, The Franklin Cover-Up. Colby went on camera, and thoroughly shocked the Yorkshire T.V. team in how strongly he came out, risking himself, to support me and my work on Franklin. Bill also wrote a letter to Attorney General Janet Reno, in which he strongly recommended that the Justice Department investigate this case from the standpoint I outlined in my book, a copy of which he enclosed with his letter. He got a formal response back from a Justice Department official, promising that the Department would indeed look into the case. But then, Bill had always backed me up, right from the earliest days, beginning in Vietnam. I vividly remember my first encounter with Colby-in the late 1960s. He discovered me by examining files of new, young officers being shipped to Vietnam, who might have \"special talents.\" At that time, my ability to speak half a dozen lan­ guages; my training in Airborne, Jungle, and Ranger Schools. well as Vietnamese Language School, and the fact I was a graduated attorney when was called into service. and voiunteered for Vietnam 'r;famrv Captain, anoar­"},{"pageNumber":419,"pageContent":"IN MEMORIAM: BILL COLBY • ently struck Colby's fancy-or at least his curiosity. Colby was officially deputy ambassador to South Vietnam at that time, but was in reality the CIA station chief. He ordered that when I showed up in Vietnam, I was to be sent directly to him. I was. Immediately, Bill immersed me in the planning of his own creation: a secret program which would later be one of the most controversial operations of the Vietnam War-the so­ called Phoenix Program. Yes, it was controversial, brutal, and at times horribly handled. But by the admission of the North Vietnamese leadership after the war, it was also the single­ most effective, and most feared program the Americans carried out during the Vietnam war. It was Bill Colby, with his power and position as ambassador in Vietnam, in 1970, that made it possible for me to accomplish something never before done or after: to run for the position of state senator from abroad. I fought my entire election campaign from Vietnam, and won it-without ever setting foot on Ameri­ can soil. I ran and won, despite the fact that the top brass, from the Postmaster General, to the heads of the Army and Joint Chiefs of Staff, had tried to stop me, because I was saying, for the first time, that which Bill Colby and others thought needed to be told to the American people. That was: \"Let us win or get out, but let's not keep conducting a charade, where we simply kill American boys to support a corrupt regime while the truth is hidden from the American people.\" Back in the States, years later, as I marched through my political life and began practice as a private attorney, I maintained the contact with Bill, and often sought his advice. He dared-when it was truly unpopular to do so-to come back to Nebraska and testify for me on controversial issues, such as the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in May 1986. Bill Colby had one characteristic rarely, if ever, found in politicians in this day and age. He told it like it is-the straight, unvarnished truth in simple, understandable terms. Colby proved that, when, as head of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), he took the CIA before the U.S. Congress, to reveal the Agency's \"family jewels\" and start the process of 379"},{"pageNumber":420,"pageContent":"• • • 380 • . THE FRANKLIN COVER·UP correcting the sins of the CIA. For this, President Gerald Ford fired Colby and replaced him with a man named George Bush. Colby told the truth again in December 1987, when he and I, and Henry Kissinger, and a couple of dozen prominent Americans, French, British, North Vietnamese, and former South Vietnamese leaders and journalists (Adm. James Stock­ dale; Col. Harry Summers, Jr.; George Will; Al Santoli; Jean­ Louis Arnaud; Ernesto Betancourt; Jacques Chaban-Delmas; Peter Collier; Sir James Goldsmith; Douglas Pike; Lam Ngoc Diep; Robert Komer; Olivier Todd; Nguyen Ngoc Quy; David Horowitz; Elliott Abrams; Tran Van Tong, to name a few) made our way to Paris, for three days, to sit around the very same table at which the Paris Peace Talks had been conducted 15 years earlier. There we all conducted our own International Conference on the Vietnam War. Though not heavily reported in the U.S., in the rest of the world the Conference was heralded as the first real truth session on what happened in Vietnam, on both sides, and why we ended up where we did. Shortly before his death, Colby gave me my final assignment. It was the week just before the Oklahoma bombing, and I spent a good amount of time with him in Washington, D.C. I brought him up to date on the Militia of Montana case which he had been following closely, describing in detail the militias' fears that the government was planning an imminent attack on them. As I sought guidance from him on how to best handle the militia situation, Bill smiled and said, \"John, it sounds to me like you have the makings of another book. Believe me,\" he continued, \"I know this MilitialPatriot movement is more sig­ nificant than most Americans, and particularly the press and politicians, could ever realize. I fear that our government does not understand the nature of this movement, nor its potential significance to this country,\" Bill said. As he continued talking, Bill became very intense. \"I watched the Anti-War Movement render it impossible for this"},{"pageNumber":421,"pageContent":"IN MEMORIAM: BILL COLBY • country to conduct or win the Vietnam War. I tell you, dear friend, that this Militia and Patriot movement in which, as an attorney, you have become one of the centerpieces, is far more significant and far more dangerous for America than the Anti­ War Movement ever was, if it is not intelligently dealt with. And I really mean this,\" Colby concluded. \"What are you saying?\" I asked Bill. \"Aren't you being a little melodramatic?\" I asked him, more than a little upset at what I thought he was saying. \"Dangerous?\" I continued. \"Hell, one Saturday night gang fight in Los Angeles is more dangerous than all the militias combined together from what I can see,\" I said. \"In fact,\" I told Colby, \"I'm willing to wager that you can't find any incidents of real danger or destruction across these United States that were, in fact, initiated by the militias. Every case I have ever heard about is a situation in which one of these characters was being attacked by some government agency over some rinky-dink crime in the first place,\" I argued. \"And, so far as I can see, most of the patriot and militia people I have dealt with are the salt-of-the-earth Americans who truly believe they are trying to save America. The typical militia member is usually someone who has a lifetime of activity, establishing that role, first in the military, then as a family man or woman, and also as a businessman or hard-working lifetime employee somewhere. Most often they are mature adults, with twenty or more years of life's experiences and learning behind them, including paying taxes, being property owners, develop­ ing their communities. \"They are not, in most cases, an eighteen- or twenty-year­ old kid, who has never held a job, been spoiled rotten, or ducked the draft or burned a flag or been arrested, or served time, or done drugs, or been a gang member or done drive-by shootings,\" I almost shouted at Colby, as I discussed this most important issue with him. \"Just what is it that makes the patriot movement and these people so dangerous?\" I demanded of him. Bill was now very intense. He spoke very slowly and very clearly, intending that there be no misunderstanding on my part of what he was saying. 381"},{"pageNumber":422,"pageContent":"382 • ·THE FRANKLIN COVER-UP \"It is not because these people are armed, that America need be concerned,\" Bill explained to my surprise. \"It is not that these people stockpile weapons and have para-military training sessions, that they are dangerous,\" Colby continued. \"What concerns me is something far more serious, that I fear our politicians do not see, cannot see, and and refuse to deal with,\" Colby said. \"They are dangerous precisely because of everything you just said. They are dangerous because these people are, in most cases mature citizens who have done everything you just described and who, tragically and in many cases very justifiably, have lost faith in the integrity and honesty of their own govern­ ment. Yes, they are dangerous because, to use your words, John, they are true patriots who are disenchanted with the government and the system they have grown up loving, support­ ing and giving their lives and talents for from the moment they were born. For many of them, it is as if they learned their mother was a prostitute and that they are bastards. It really is that traumatic.\" I listened to Bill; I looked at him, and said, almost playing the devil's advocate by defending the politicians, \"So what, Bill? There have always been unhappy people who think the politicians are crooked; that the government is bad; that the end of the world is coming or whatever. We call them nuts or crackpots or whatever and lock a few of them up now and then and go on with our business. What makes these people so much different or more dangerous than any other group who has tromped through history in the last 225 years of this coun­ try's existence?\" Then my friend, the man whom I have found to have a better grip on the processes of history than anyone else, delivered his punch line. \"They are dangerous, John, because there are so many of them. It is one thing to have a few nuts or dissidents. They can be dealt with, justly or otherwise, so that they do not pose a danger to the system. It is quite another situation when you have a true movement-millions of citizens-believ­ ing something-particularly when the movement is made up of society's average, successful citizens."},{"pageNumber":423,"pageContent":"IN MEMORIAM: BILL COLBY • \"The handwriting is on the wall in several places,\" Colby continued. \"We know from CNN and USA Today polls that about three out of every four Americans no longer trust their own government. And the distance between the government and the citizens is increasing instead of decreasing. And that means, quite simply, John, that there is a base of support for the patriot and militia community which is not visible and may not be seen or understood by our government. Our government and political leaders are still in the mode of viewing the outspo­ ken and visible members of the so-called patriot movement as simply a few nuts who need to be shut up. This is a very dangerous trend. It is time for government and the media to begin closing the gap between the government, the media and the patriot movement, rather than exacerbating it. \"The first step in that process is communication,\" Colby continued. Then, Colby stunned me with his next declaration. \"John,\" he said, looking me in the eyes, \"someone needs to step into the forefront and tell the story of the militias and the patriot movement-what it is, why it has developed, what it means to America if not properly addressed by government; who is involved and just how broad-based this movement or attitude is; where it is strongest, and how this movement can be positively directed, rather than negatively directed-perhaps by foreign powers. \"That is what your next book should be, and it must be written,\" Colby instructed, \"rather than simply spoken to me. And yes, John, I will do everything to help you do this book and tell this story. Your book must become the communications device where both sides of this controversy can go to learn about themselves but, more important, to learn about the other side.\" Colby concluded, \"And you can and must do that because you are really in the perfect position, and have the capability to do it. In fact, right now maybe you are the only one in that position.\" I was shocked by Bill Colby's near-command to write a new book. True, as the attorney for some of the Montana Militia, I had been put in a unique position to see the inner workings of the militias, but from a position of objectivity, as 383"},{"pageNumber":424,"pageContent":"384 • THE FRANKLIN COVER-UP a lawyer. I had first been drawn into the \"militia scene\" as a result of the wide circulation of this book. By the militias themselves, I was seen, not as an attorney, but as a combatant, against the worst forms of obscene corruption by our govern­ ment, and by our nation's so-called elites. The fact that I was a practicing attorney and a former elected official was of secondary consequence. \"I think you are serious,\" I said to Colby with a gentle snicker, trying to break the tension of the moment. \"You really are going to help me do this militia book, as you call it-and I know when you say you will help, that means I have access to a world of intelligence and knowledge that cannot be matched anywhere else on this planet earth. I will do it,\" I promised Bill. \"Start on it right away in fact. OK?\" \"Should be a best seller,\" Bill Colby said. \"Next time I see you here in D.C. in the middle of May, you should have the first chapter of your new book, Militia,\" Bill said. A few days later, on April 19, 1995, a bomb blew up the Federal Building in Oklahoma City. Within a year, my dear friend and longtime adviser was found dead in the Chesapeake Bay. . . . I have very serious doubts about the description of Bill Colby's death that emerged from the police search and the subsequent coroner's inquiry. I do not possess any \"secret information\" about Bill Colby's final hours; I base my doubts on 25 years of near continuous contact and collaboration with the man, a collaboration which deepened in his final years. I knew Bill Colby very well; I knew his personal habits, his idiosyncracies. Colby had a sailboat and his little get-away cottage, where he went as often as he could. I visited him there on several occasions, as Bill invited me sailing whenever I was in town. Inevitably, however, the weather forecast would warn of a possibility of rain, or a drop of rain would fall, or he'd notice that the moon was not in the right position, or the sun too hot,"},{"pageNumber":425,"pageContent":"IN MEMORIAM: BILL COLBY • or whatever. And Bill would decide not to take the risk and go out sailing. My point is simple. Bill Colby was the single most meticu­ lously careful, programmed, organized individual I have ever encountered, especially when it came to matters of safety, security, and personal activities. Therefore, the description given in the media, surrounding his death, does not cohere with Bill Colby's personality, his character, his modus operandi, and my personal experiences with him over many years. Bill Colby was not the kind of person who would take off on an evening boating expedition, leaving his computer still turned on at his desk, his half-finished dinner still sitting on the table, and most of the lights on in the cottage. That was not Bill. Furthermore, Bill had been the victim of a \"robbery\" in Washington, D.C., not too long before his death, in which he had been badly beaten, and easily could have died. This \"robbery\" and his actual death were both mysterious incidents, in a relatively short span of time. I have a hard time believing in coincidences, when it comes to people like Bill Colby. His mysterious death has also brought to my mind, his own explanations of how people end up dead, in the course of our discussing the death of Franklin case investigator Gary Caradori-a death Colby himself had investigated. His exact statement on this was: \"If it's done right, you'll never know how it was done, or who did it for sure. That's what profession­ alism is all about.\" Colby described both professional assassinations, as well as some bungles. The case of Fidel Castro, he said, was one of the biggest fiascos that Bill had ever run across. Colby told the story how in one, now known, memorable sequence of screw-ups, the CIA tried to get Fidel's mistress to plant a tube of super toxic toothpaste onto Castro's bath stand. The ploy ultimately resulted in the girlfriend becoming a dead, ex­ girlfriend. The blunders and screw-ups and lack of professional­ ism, in the efforts to get Castro, drove Bill to insist that the CIA should simply quit trying to assassinate him. In contrast, Colby always used the example of Chilean Presi­ 385"},{"pageNumber":426,"pageContent":"• • • 386 • FRANKLIN COVER-UP dent Salvador Allende's death as the perfect assassination. \"We didn't do that one,\" Colby informed me. \"Everybody thinks we did. But, we truly did not. Someone else got to him before we did, because we sure were planning it. But, whoever did that one, really did it right. We (CIA) are taking the blame in the minds of most governments around the world. But despite the fact that we did not assassinate Allende, everybody knew we wanted to and, whoever did it, left no trails. The best example of a perfect assassination-no trails; somebody else takes the blame; mission accomplished.\" I rather suspect in my own mind that that is the situation with Colby's own death. In the aftermath of Bill's death, a line began to emerge that Bill was either deeply depressed, or suffering from some fatal ailment, and, perhaps, took his own life. I think a recounting of my last face-to-face discussion with Bill Colby should dispel this gossip for good. I had this meeting with Bill shortly before his death. We had a very lengthy discussion about life, and I asked him, among other things, \"Bill, if you were going to pick any period of your life that you would say was the most satisfying and enjoyable, what two-, or three-, or five-year period would it be? World War II, Vietnam, your days as head of CIA? When would it be and what made it so special?\" Without hesitation-exactly one week before he died-Bill said the following: \"The last five years and for sure the next five years,\" Bill said. \"Are you serious?\" I asked. \"Absolutely,\" Bill said. \"Here's why. First, I have virtually no pressure; yet I am in a position to use my entire life's experiences and learning, and share them with the world to help make a difference. You know what I am doing immediately after I leave you?\" Bill continued. \"I am headed for Outer Mongolia to give a briefing and to talk to the heads of business and government there."},{"pageNumber":427,"pageContent":"• • • IN MEMORIAM: BILL COLBY • \"I just got back from Italy where I did the same thing. That's what I have been doing. I love it. Travel when you want and at somebody else's expense; receive the best treatment you could imagine-equal to or better than a head of state-but without all the responsibility, and pressure, and problems. And know that when you speak, they really do listen and know that you really can make a difference in world events, sometimes even more profound than presidents of countries. I love it. And I am in as good health as I have ever been. All the things I wanted to say, and all the places I dreamed of seeing, I am doing, and I'm going to keep doing it and enjoying it for at least the next five years, I hope,\" Colby concluded. \"So, John, don't be discouraged,\" Bill assured me, \"You are young yet, and your best and happiest years really are ahead of you.\" At the time of his death, Bill was working with Britain's Lord William Rees-Mogg, and his American sidekick, James Dale Davidson, publishing a series of newsletters, on interna­ tional events, financial opportunities, and politics. In fact, he was working on an article for one of those newsletters when he died. Rees-Mogg and Davidson are strange birds. Lord William was, for over a decade, the editor-in-chief of the staid Times of London, and its Sunday Times of London. He fits the stereo­ type of the classic English \"Colonel Blimp,\" the blunt imperial­ ist, who periodically uncorks with a nasty mouthful of invec­ tives against the \"commoner,\" or the darker-skinned races. After all, he used to write that in the coming age of society, an elite of 5% of the total population would rule over the other 95% as virtual slaves. But Rees-Mogg is not justy nasty-he represents great power. In England, it has long been said that The Times, the flagship paper of the Establishment, regularly announces Britain's foreign policy before the Foreign Office even knows what that policy will be. Rees-Mogg still writes a weekly column for The Times, and 387"},{"pageNumber":428,"pageContent":"388 • THE FRANKLIN COVER·UP is one of the major contributors to the newsletter, Strategic Investment. At the time of his death, Bill had emerged as Strategic Investment's leading \"gee-strategist,\" writing a lengthy front-page article in almost every edition. (Since Bill's death, another former CIA Director, Robert Gates, has been coopted into writing a number of articles, occupying the space formerly reserved for Bill's words of wisdom.) But on several occasions, when I saw Bill or spoke with him during the last year of his life, I'd ask him whether I should subscribe to his newsletter, or, whether he'd just give me a few copies to look over. He always told me not to waste my money. \"Ask me about any situation you're interested in, and I'll give you as thorough a briefing as I possibly can. But don't believe a word you read in that newsletter I'm writing for.\" Strange. But, then again, Bill Colby spent his entire adult life in the shadow world of spies and counter-spies. Maybe his involvement with Rees-Mogg was more complicated than I ever speculated. On at least one point, I know there was a savage difference between Bill and Lord Rees-Mogg and his crowd. Rees-Mogg is one of the most vocal detractors of President Clinton and the First Lady, and often devotes his Times of London columns exclusively to tirades against the American President. Strategic Investment, which goes out to a predominantly American read­ ership, contains non-stop assaults against the Clintons. Not only was Bill's wife, Sally Shelton Colby, in a senior position in the Clinton Administration, but Colby himself had empha­ sized to me, repeatedly, that Clinton was a great President, and that it was urgent that he be re-elected. And then I recall another incident, which I barely noticed at the time, but which now stands out in retrospect. Together with Rees-Mogg, the most savage press hound attacking Clin­ ton was one Ambrose Evans-Pritchard, a Briton who has spent hundreds of hours in Arkansas \"investigating\" the President, and writing streams of articles in The American Spectator, the British Daily Telegraph, and other papers, attacking Clinton. Evans-Pritchard once called me, urgently demanding a meeting."},{"pageNumber":429,"pageContent":"IN MEMORIAM: BILL COLBY • I had never heard of him before, and so asked Bill if he had ever heard of this fellow, \"Evans-Prickard, or something,\" as I put it, barely recalling his name. Bill answered, rather omi­ nously, as I now look back, \"His name is Ambrose Evans­ Pritchard. And,\" he said, \"be very careful.\" A week after our get-together, in which Bill spoke so enthusi­ astically about his work and his travels, he was dead-under the most unusual circumstances, his death officially labeled an \"accident.\" I did not believe it then, and I do not believe it now. But I do believe what Bill said: \"If it's done right, you will never know how it was done, or who did it.\" And so, my dear friend, I wish you a last good-bye. I will do my best to carry out the final tasks you assigned me, as I always did, so many years ago, as a Combat Infantry Captain under your command, in the rice paddies and hamlets of Vietnam. 389"},{"pageNumber":430,"pageContent":"390 EPILOGUE I finally understood the true meaning of the Franklin case one night in early 1996. Watching television and skipping through the channels, I came upon the movie Billy Budd. Instantly I zeroed in on this movie, and my heart, rather than the channels, started skipping. By the time the movie ended, the Franklin cover-up made sense. Alisha Owen's imprisonment for telling the truth made sense. The protection of the perpetrators by our highest public officials, finally made sense. I understood, also, why it was necessary to discredit me, John DeCamp, and to kill Gary Caradori, with his eight-year-old son. Any nagging doubts I may have had about any aspects of Paul Bonacci's charges were laid to rest. And it was clear to me, at last, that public officials at all levels knew Paul was telling the truth, as they set out to destroy him. Where did the blinding revelation come from? Let me go back a few months, to my last attempt to get a new trial for Alisha Owen. At that hearing, Troy Boner, who had originally told Gary Caradori the truth, and who had been forced to recant, was preparing to testify-to tell the truth as you read it in his affidavit in Chapter 21. Troy Boner was going to provide the information in open court, under oath, that would blow the lid off the Franklin case and force a new trial for Alisha Owen. As Troy came into the courthouse, he was immediately ushered into a private room by county judicial authorities. He was advised that a \"Special Attorney\" had been appointed to protect him. For approximately one hour, while the hearing was delayed, Troy was cornered in a room with this \"Special Attorney\" and with other officials from the prosecutor's office,"},{"pageNumber":431,"pageContent":"EPILOGUE • the very same prosecutorial team Troy was about to testify against. When Troy came out of the meeting, I knew he was broken, his morale smashed. His head hung down. He could not, or would not look at anyone. As I approached Troy, his new court-appointed attorney tried to step between us. With probably the last ounce of courage he could muster, Troy leaned over and whispered to me, \"Oh God, forgive me. They guaranteed if I talk here today, they will put me away for twenty years. Guaranteed I would never see the light of day again. Told me that I would be charged with perjury for my original testimony, if I opened my mouth today in court. Don't call me up there. I can't survive in prison. I know they can put me there. Look what they did to Alisha. Look what they did to my brother. I've got no choice. They told me I had to take the Fifth Amendment and refuse to testify. Otherwise, they promised I would be taken directly from court to jail.\" We all proceeded into the court room, where I called Troy to the stand. I showed Troy his affidavit. He hung his head, and when I asked my first question, \"Would you please state your name?\" Troy responded, \"I take the Fifth Amendment,\" an answer he repeated, in a barely audible voice, to all my other questions. It was hopeless. I ceased my questioning, and shortly thereaf­ ter the hearing ended. I walked back to the judge's chambers to clear up any final details. Judge Enbody had been specially appointed by the Nebraska State Supreme Court to this hearing, which I had won from the Supreme Court based on Troy's new information. (The next day I learned that he had been appointed to the Court of Appeals-a very substantial advancement in his career.) Sitting in Judge Enbody's chambers, with my head hung so low it was hitting my shoestrings, I was given the key to unlock the meaning of Franklin. \"I do not understand it, Your Honor,\" I kept repeating. \"As God is my witness, I do not think that there is a judge or other person involved in this case who does not know that horrible 391"},{"pageNumber":432,"pageContent":"392 • THE FRANKLIN COVER-UP injustice has been done. Everybody knows that Alisha Owen is telling the truth and that she is being punished for it. And, Your Honor, a person has to be deaf, dumb, blind, and totally dishonest, not to know that some of this state's and nation's top businessmen and public officials have engaged in the worst crimes possible, which are now being covered up. And these kids, instead of being honored and protected for exposing these things, are being sent to prison. Why? Why? Why?\" Judge Enbody looked at me. Slowly, his voice shaking, he began to talk. \"I am just a man. I am not a god. I wish I were. I have no choice in what I have done. I am just a man, just a man, not a god. I am doing what I must do with the evidence before me,\" Judge Enbody concluded. He appeared even more shaken and upset than I was. I shook my head. \"I don't understand. I just don't under­ stand,\" I kept repeating. \"Everybody knows what is happening, but nobody is willing to do anything about it. Why? Why?!!\" Judge Enbody looked at me and said, very slowly, \"If you want to understand the entire Franklin case, I can help you. Go read 'Billy Budd.' Read 'Billy Budd.' If you will do that, John, and if you understand the book, then you will understand the what and why of Franklin, and why it can be no other way. I do not say you will like it. I do not say you will agree with it. But at least you will understand it. That, I promise you. Go read 'Billy Budd'.\" Those were the last words I spoke with the Judge on the case. I left his chambers, burnt out, but angry. And I forgot all about Billy Budd, until the night I happened upon the movie. The story of Billy Budd is set in the British Navy near the end of the eighteenth century. Billy was a young sailor, who, although impressed into the British Navy, bore no ill will to the authorities for having dragooned him; indeed, he was the very picture of innocence and good-will, and was almost univer­ sally loved aboard his war-ship. One officer, however, devel­ oped an insane jealousy of Billy, and set out to frame him up for allegedly inciting mutiny. Since there had been several notorious mutinies in the British fleet at the time, the mere"},{"pageNumber":433,"pageContent":"EPILOGUE • whisper of \"mutiny\" was enough to spread panic among the ship's officers. To make a long story short, because of certain incriminating appearances in the case, the captain and his senior officers, although they knew Billy was innocent of all charges, nonethe­ less sentenced him to hang, a necessity-as they viewed it­ to \"save the system,\" not just on their own ship, but in the British fleet as a whole. Now I think I do understand the Franklin case. I know, now, that all the public officials involved in Franklin-whether they ever heard of Billy Budd or not-fully understood what they were doing. And what they all have done, and will continue to do in this case, Franklin, and no doubt many others like it, is this: Protect the \"system\" at all costs. The \"system\" is the only ultimate sacred cow-not any particular law or constitution, but only \"the system.\" Because, ultimately, it is the system which makes certain that the individuals functioning within it-from judges to lawyers, to prosecutors, to politicians, to businessmen­ have their places and positions, and opportunities and pecking order, and future. And, though it is unfortunate, that on occasion the protection of the \"system\" requires the deliberate sacrifice of perfectly innocent people, that is hoped overall to be the exception rather than the rule. But without the \"system\" ... So, Judge Enbody, now I understand. And, as you said, I may not agree, but I do understand. But then I have one final, nagging question. How do I know when, or if, the \"system\" itself has become so corrupted, that evil is the rule, rather than the exception? And when that occurs, what do I do about it? But I think I know the answer to that one-myoId command­ ing officer in Vietnam told me what I had to do.

In 1975, as Saigon was falling, DeCamp excused himself from the Nebraska Senate, went to Vietnam in the final days before Vietnam collapsed, and initiated and organized the world famous \"Operation Baby Lift.\" This program evacuated 2,800 Vietnamese/American children orphaned in the war. These chil­ dren were brought to the USA, where all were adopted or reunited with people from their own families. For this act, DeCamp was honored at the White House by the President of the United States, recognized by the u.S.

In 1991 John DeCamp filed the first-of-its-kind lawsuit in Federal Court charging THE OMAHA CATHOLIC ARCH­ DIOCESE and fifteen other prominent individuals and institu­ tions, including Larry King and World Herald Publisher Harold Andersen, with conspiracy to deprive Paul Bonacci of his civil rights. DeCamp's suit detailed slander, false imprisonment, child abuse, assault, battery and infliction of emotional distress suffered by Bonacci. THIS LAWSUIT with the Catholic arch­ diocese of Omaha as the FIRST NAMED DEFENDANT was attacked by the press and the politicians, and particularly certain members of the Catholic clergy as absolutely sinful and unfor­ giveable and outrageous in the extreme. And, the Federal Judge allowed almost immediately for the Catholic Bishop and Arch­ diocese to be excused from the suit. But, with persistence from DeCamp, and DeCamp's presentation of pictures and witnesses the pedophiles had denied even existed and shocking informa­ tion that had previously been denied by all the defendants, A ONE MILLION DOLLAR JUDGMENT was won by DeCamp in the case against Larry King, the remaining defendant, who is prominent in this book. 395"},{"pageNumber":436,"pageContent":"INDEX ABC-TV, 148 Abel, George P., 158 Abrams, Elliott, 380 Adams, Don, 258, 261 Agency for International Develop­ ment, xi, 177 Ak-Sar-Ben, Knights of, 132--4, 136, 144-5 Albert, Paula, 150 Albert Food Brokerage, 135 Albert, Michael, 135 Alejos Arzu, Roberto, 180 Allen, Alfie, 69-70, 77 Allende, Salvador, 386 ALPHA, 329 Amato, Angelo, 135 Ambrose, David, 135 Amen, Paul, 41-2, 44, 47-8 America First Corp., 134, 144, 158-9 American Association for Protect­ ing Children, xviii American Express, 148 American Investment Group, 44-6 American Savings Company, 40-1 American Spectator, 388 America's Most Wanted, 278, 290-2 Americares, 180 Ameritas Financial Services, 158 Andersen, Harold, 63, 68-71, 77, 92,94-5, 100, 110, 115, 128, 130-1, 134-5, 138--40, 142-5, 160, 177-8,218,251,288, 327, 395 Andresen, Robert, 80, 82, 83, 109­ 10, 146,314 Andrews, Mark, 356 Antelope County (Nebraska), 203 Anti-Defamation League, 242, 294 Anti-War Movement, 380-1 Aquino, Michael, xx, 328-30 Arkansas, 388 Arnaud, Louis, 380 Artichoke, Project, 328 Aryan Nation, 330 Association for Voluntary Steriliza­ tion, 148 Atlantic Telecast, 281-2 Austin (Texas), 100 A vvenimenti, 241 Baack, Dennis, 83 Baer, Alan, 68-71, 73, 77-9, 81-2, 87,92, 100-2, 107, 124, 132, 136, 140, 145, 158, 189, 204, 217,239,248,250-1,302-4, 308, 313-16, 321, 327 Bahamas, 172 Bahensky, Melvin, 40, 244 Bailey, Edd H., 159 Baird-Holz, 135 397"},{"pageNumber":437,"pageContent":"398 • THE FRANKLIN COVER-UP Baker, Bill, 250 Bakersfield (California), 234, 238 Bamberg, N.C., 330 Bank of England, 331 Barbee, James, 45 Barker, Joseph III, 135-7 Barksdale, John, 152-3 Barnett, Wally, 254 Batchelder, Anne S., 158 Beerman, Alan, 1 Believe the Children, 240 Benes, Richard, 203 Benson, Paul, 353, 356, 365, 366 Bentz, Bob, 237-8 Bentz, Lois, 237-8 Berkshire Hathaway, 148 Berney, Melvin, 183 Berry, John Stevens, 30-1, 122, 182, 190, 194, 196, 222, 293 BETA, 329 Betancourt, Emesto, 380 Bevel, Rev.
