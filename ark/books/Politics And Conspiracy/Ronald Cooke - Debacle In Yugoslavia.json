We noted then that Ronald Reagan said he never made a foreign policy decision without first consulting the Vatican. This Vatican consultation has been going on for years in the US State Department. Many conservative writers are concerned with the one- worldism which they perceive to be written large in the agenda of the United States government. What they do not seem to perceive is that much of this international or global thrust comes from the representatives of the Vatican in the US State Department. Almost every move that the US makes in Latin America is taken in conjunction with the information supplied by the Roman Catholic church. Now in Colombia, at this very moment, the US is getting more deeply involved to help to shore up the repressive Roman Catholic government of Colombia with US military might. The debacle in Kosovo has all the marks of Vatican propaganda tied to it. With the NATO Command working under, pledged to, and held together by the TREATY OF ROME, the US joined in to help implement the substance of that very Treaty. The propaganda which erupted in the US in support of the NATO action was incredible to behold. It should be obvious to any thinking individual that there are always TWO sides to every dispute. The US news media for the most part have ignored what triggered the dispute in Kosovo. In Kosovo the KLA (the Islamic Rebel Army out to make Kosovo totally Islamic) have been fighting now for several years to oust the Serbs from their own country and take it over by force of arms. To see more clearly what has been happening in Kosovo one could use the state of Rhode Island as an example. Suppose that Rhode Island was slowly but surely being taken over by an Islamic Rebel Force. Suppose that to hasten the take over the Rebel Islamic Force started to kill Americans and drive them off their own land. The Americans then appeal to the US government who sends in the US army to defend the American citizens who are being murdered and massacred. NATO begins to look into the problem and decides to bomb the US Army for intervening and not only the Army but begins to bomb electrical -1 -"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"installations, bridges, radio and television stations, and the Chinese Embassy to boot. How would Americans feel if such a scenario developed? For this is exactly what has occurred in Kosovo. Some critic may say that Americans would never have treated the Islamic Rebel Force as the Serbs did the KLA. So it is instructive then to remember how the Clinton Administration dealt with the Koresh Group of Waco, Texas. This group had put no one off their land by force; nor had they killed anyone. Yet they were all blown away in a blazing holocaust, men, women, children, and babies. As of this writing the whole Waco event is again being investigated. Some observers thought the gunfire was laid down on purpose to keep the men, women, and children of the Koresh group from fleeing their building. So this whole incident is under investigation again. So if the Koresh massacre is any criterion by which to judge the Reno-Clinton reaction to rebels against the United States government, what would such a tandem produce if there was a REAL threat to Americans in one of the states equal to the armed rebellion of the KLA, or even the IRA? They would put that armed rebellion down quicker than Milosevic and with far greater firepower! In the case of armed rebellion a sovereign state has the right to defend itself. And Milosevic should have had that right, but instead the Clinton Administration in league with NATO and the Treaty of Rome decided that the rebels were right and the sovereign state wrong in defending itself. From 1980 the Serbs have been systematically purged from Croatia and Bosnia. An estimated 1,200,000 have been driven from these two former states of Yugoslavia. Not one voice in that great darling of the news media \"THE INTERNATIONAL COMUNITY\" was raised to object against the genocide of the Serbs. The Ethnic Cleansing was allowed to proceed without so much as whisper of protest by that gallant defender of the oppressed, Bill Clinton. So not only was no bombing campaign launched by the US and NATO; there was not even a WORD of protest! The Vatican was the first \"state\" to recognize Roman Catholic Croatia when it illegally seceded from Yugoslavia. (Just think what the US did when the southern states sought to secede from the Union). The US, following the Vatican lead, and forgetting their own history, also quickly recognized the -2-"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"secession of Croatia. Bosnia then separated from Yugoslavia and again the US quickly recognized it as a Muslim State even though one third of the population was Serbian Orthodox Christian. Again the Serbs fought to save themselves from being driven out of what once had been their own country. Outside forces were again brought in to implement the Treaty of Rome and drive out and KEEP OUT the Serbs. Over one million Serbs have been driven out of Bosnia and NOT ALLOWED TO RETURN! Mystery Babylon UN soldiers are there to keep the Serbs out of their own country. Milosevic, to show how desperate the western press is to create a monster, has been compared to Adolf Hitler. Such comparisons are really quite pathetic. Hitler controlled most of Europe and North Africa; Milosevic has not been able to keep his own country together. One honest speaker on C-Span noted that Yugoslavia was a truly multi-ethnic state comprised of no less than 22 different nationalities all living together peaceably until Croatia broke away and started the divisions which have plagued the whole region ever since. The winter Olympics just a few years ago praised the multi-religious make-up of Sarajevo and pointed out during the telecasts that Sarajevo was a model for other areas where sectarian violence was then erupting. The IMF, on the advice of the United States, refused to give loans to Yugoslavia which would have helped its economy. This, I believe, was done at the request of the Vatican. The failure to get the loans kept the country from expanding its economy and keeping pace with the rest of Europe. Milosevic in other words was deliberately hung out to dry. The western nations wanted him and his government to fail. Much opposition was voiced against Milosevic in his own country, according to Nikolas Stavros, a Balkans Analyst on CNN, but THERE WAS NO HELP WHATSOEVER FROM THE WESTERN ALLIANCE TO ENCOURAGE THE PEACEFUL DEMONSTRATIONS AGAINST MILOSEVIC. When thousands of people flooded the streets and blew whistles in protest, Stavros said, they did not even have enough paper to write their anti- government slogans on, and there was NO HELP WHATSOEVER from the Western Alliance to encourage their peaceful protests. Stavros said that the Western Alliance decided to bomb ALL Yugoslavs indiscriminately even though their were many who opposed Milosevic and could have brought his government down with just a little help from the outside. -3-"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Again, according to another analyst if the west was going to intervene in Yugoslavia they should have done it much earlier before things started to deteriorate between the Serbs and the Kosovars. It is obvious that the Western Alliance, and President Clinton particularly, WAITED to intervene. In other words, President Clinton USED the intervention in Yugoslavia to further his own political agenda, and saved it for a crucial time to draw attention away from his scandals at home. The liberal news media basically subservient to the \"International Community\" NEVER have probed too deeply into Clinton's scandals and how he works to get them off the front page and a foreign escapade put in their place. -4-"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"The Vatican and the Western Alliance No one can understand Europe today, or even the world today, without taking into account the intrigue of the Vatican. The Reformers equated the Roman Catholic Institution - The Vatican now - with Mystery Babylon the Great. Unless one understands the part that Rome plays in the world he is at a loss to explain why certain things occur. NATO and the US are now over in Europe applying the policy of the Vatican to the Balkans. A brief historical review will show why the Vatican wants Yugoslavia punished and destroyed. For about one thousand years the Balkan peninsula has been engulfed in war. The main warring factions are three: The Roman Catholic faction concentrated now mainly in Croatia; the Serbian Orthodox faction located now mainly in Serbia; and the Muslim faction now concentrated mainly in Albania, and Kosovo, which is still a part of Yugoslavia. These three groups have battled each other for centuries. In modern Yugoslavia the tensions still ran high. When world war II broke out the Germans occupied Yugoslavia. The Nazis set up the puppet state of Croatia under Anton Pavelic which was a Roman Catholic state. The Serbs living then in Croatia were subjected to one of the worst waves of ethnic cleansing perpetrated in the Twentieth-century. The massacring and the forced conversions went on unabated for three long years. One Jewish writer even claims that Kurt Waldheim, the Roman Catholic Austrian, who was made the Secretary General of the United Nations, worked with the NAZIS in Croatia where thousands of Jews were shipped off to the German concentration camps. He claims that three years are missing from Waldheim's dossier. In the middle of all the massacring and ethnic cleansing of the Serbs from Croatia in the years 1941 -1944, stood the diabolical figure of Archbishop Stepinac. Stepinac was a fanatical Roman Catholic who took his fanaticism seriously. He inspired his priests in their forcible conversions of the Serbs, and their slaughter, if they did not convert to Roman Catholicism. Various writers have sought to document the horrors of these years in various works. Avro Manhattan, the British writer, documents with photographs and a collection of personal interviews of eyewitnesses, one of the Worst cases of papal genocide in the twentieth-century. -5-"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"In Catholic Terror Today . Manhattan gives a description of the horrific deeds of the Ustashi, (some write it as Ustasha today). The Ustasha were personally engaged in the murders of Serbian Orthodox people and clergy. He related how Anton Pavelic and Pope Pius XII planned for a Roman Catholic state to be set up with the help of the Nazis. He reports of the mass executions of Serbian prisoners, some who were pushed alive into their graves. He reports how Dr. Sekulich brought to London two documents hidden in the soles of his shoes and in the lining of his coat, on which the appeals of the Serbian Orthodox Church were made to the Nazi Commander-in-Chief General Schroder, to intervene and stop the massacre of the Serbs by Anton Pavelic. The document also noted: \"We estimate that, so far (August 8th, 1941), the number of people killed surpasses 180,000.\" 1 Many of these people were burned alive in their churches, or machine-gunned if they tried to flee the burning buildings. Others had their throats slit and others were machine- gunned or thrown into their graves alive. The murders and the killings were so horrific that few would believe that they did indeed occur. The Vatican propaganda in the US was able to silence any news of this enormous genocide carried out with papal blessings and the direct support of the Roman Catholic Arch-bishop Stepinac. The reason why Yugoslavia is being bombed goes back to this papally inspired genocide. For Archbishop Stepinac was arrested and tried by Yugoslavia for his part in the genocide. After the Nazis left Croatia, Anton Pavelic fled to South America, and Stepinac was arrested andput on trial in Zagreb. He was sentenced to 16 years hard labor for his cruel and demonic work in Croatia. Yugoslavia was the only country in the world with the courage to put such rascals on trial. The Vatican has NEVER FORGIVEN Yugoslavia for putting their Archbishop on trial. He was made a Cardinal \"for doing the Lord's work in Croatia\" by the Roman Catholic church, so they looked upon him as one of their heroes. So for Yugoslavia to put him on trial is something that the Vatican has never forgiven. Manhattan's work was totally ignored in the United States if not suppressed. His work has exacting documentation and is supported by other writers. The extent to which the Vatican went to have this suppressed is demonstrated by the fact that the United States State department, which took away Dr. Ian Paisley's visa, also refused a visa to Manhattan to visit this country for a speaking tour. The State department at this time -6-"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"showed its bent toward the Vatican and also denied true freedom of speech. References 1.

Even misled Protestants in the United States sympathized with the cruel despot and shook their fists in rage at Yugoslavia. Here is a sampling of the propaganda that filled the news media back then. It is both a commentary on just how much the US has been propagandized by Rome, and also an insight into the effect such propaganda has had on North America. On October 5,1946 a parade of witnesses testified in Zagreb that Roman Catholic priests armed with pistols went out to convert Orthodox Serbs and massacred them. Most of the witnesses were Roman Catholic Croat peasants and laborers. One witness said six hundred and fifty Serbs were taken into a church under false pretences, and then were stabbed and beaten to death by Ustashi members after the doors were locked. The Serbian Church in Exile in London, placed the number of those persecuted and massacred by Stepinac and his henchmen, at 1,200,000. Various other writers put the number at 800,000, and 500,000. The true number will never be known this side of the Judgment. Suffice it to say that hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians were massacred under Pavelic's and Stepinac's reign of terror. Manhattan describes the effect of Stepinac's reign of terror: The greatest losses, however, were inflicted among the humble members of the Orthodox Church. In Pavelic's new Ustashi State, in fact, between April, 1941, and the spring of 1945, thanks to Ustashi units Ustashi police, and concentration camps, at least 850,000 members of the Orthodox Church and citizens of Yugoslavia, including numerous Croats (plus 30,000 Jews and 40,000 Gypsies), perished thus. Hundreds of Catholic priests and Catholic friars contributed, either directly or indirectly, to this colossal massacre. To say that these were the deeds of individuals ... acting on their own initiative after scorning the admonitions of their Church and rebelling against her authority, is untrue. The Ustashi massacres, all the atrocities committed by either Catholic officials, priests, or monks, fell within a coolly calculated scheme for the total elimination of the Orthodox -8-"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"masses, actively or passively resisting their absorption into the Catholic fold. Indeed, it was the premeditated policy of the Catholic Hierarchy, acting on behalf of its true inspirer, the Vatican. 1 Manhattan personally interviewed people who survived this wonderful example of a \"Christian\" Social Order. What they saw and went through shows that those who endeavor to set up religious Vaticanomies are not exactly friendly to those who refuse to be converted to them or absorbed by them. Archbishop Stepinac was convicted on all principal counts of aiding the Axis, supporting the puppet Croatian Roman Catholic dictatorship of Anton Pavelic, abetting the terroristic Ustasha, and of glorifying the murderous Ustasha in the Roman Catholic press, pastoral letters, and speeches. 2 He was sentenced to sixteen years of hard labor. His sentence was immediately greeted by a blast of Vatican propaganda around the world. Avro Manhattan recounts in his work the worldwide reaction to the sentencing of Stepinac. The Vatican uttered a cry of horror, instantly amplified a thousandfold by the Catholic Hierarchies, Catholic agencies, and Catholic Press the world over. Pope Pius XII ordered the excommunication of all those who had taken part in the trial, from Tito himself down to the last official connected in any way with Stepinac's indictment. All received a solemn Catholic guarantee of eternal damnation in genuine Catholic brimstone and inextinguishable infernal fire... Had such authority been exercised only in hell, it would have worried fewer Christians than is generally believed... With millions of the living however, this same papal authority is not fictitious. It is real, widespread, and dangerous. It can tap vast sources of power at will, whether to help its friends and allies or to dismay its enemies. Last but not least it can engender the darkest currents of religious and political emotionalism, to control and use the deceived masses of Catholics and non-Catholics alike to further its own interests. The case of Stepinac once more strikingly demonstrated this. The Pope set in motion the vast machinery of Catholic propaganda, which in no time flooded the world with such mountainous distortions and such plain dishonesty as to shame the most deceitful of all the devils in hell. Overnight -9-"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Stepinac, the authoritarian leader, the political plotter, the politician, the promoter of forced conversions, the tolerator and indirect instigator of the Ustashi massacres, was made to appear as Stepinac the defender of true democracy, the most holy Archbishop, the courageous champion of religious freedom, the persecuted martyr. Millions accepted the Catholic version. The result was that soon large sections of the western world who until that time had not even bothered with the whole thing, hailed Stepinac as the pitiful victim of anti-Christian barbarism. The lay press followed suit, exalting Stepinac as the champion of Christianity fighting the powers of darkness. Religious and political leaders joined in the chorus. Foreign offices, heads of States, and indeed, whole governments of Catholic and non-Catholic lands sent official protests against \"such unheard of religious persecution.\" Questions were heatedly asked in the British House of Commons, in the French, Italian, and Belgian Chambers of Deputies, in the American House of Representatives, and in the Senate. In the USA President Truman was subjected to tremendous pressure to force him to intervene on behalf of the \"martyred Stepinac.\" 3 Bishop Charles F. Buddy, Roman Catholic leader from San Diego, California, wired President Truman asking for a protest to be launched in defense of Stepinac. He urged President Truman to send a straightforward fearless protest of the infamous persecution of Archbishop Stepinac and the Roman Catholic church in Yugoslavia. Liberty-loving Americans are not indifferent to the vicious travesty intended to discredit this great patriot who has valiantly championed the rights of his people. Those people are now enslaved; hence the attempt to silence the voice of their intrepid leader who is the foe to every form of dictatorship. 4 Buddy also added that Yugoslavia was out to crush the last vestige of religious freedom within her borders and that such action challenges \"Christians\" throughout the world. He further added, that such persecution could not be ignored if \"we are to maintain our national honor and our pledge to up hold the Four Freedoms.\" 5 -10-"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"The Vatican paper Osservatore Romano denounced the sentence as ignominious and said that the trial in Zagreb was a trial against the Roman Catholic church. Francis Cardinal Spellman, Archbishop of New York, said that Stepinac was \"a victim of the forces that seek to destroy men's freedom, ruin America, and dominate the world.\" 6 Spellman was particularly incensed and having the ear of six Presidents, he made the most of his opportunity. He said that moral nihilism is creeping suffocatingly over the world poisoning the bloodstream and blocking the heartbeat of America, endangering freedoms of men everywhere. We must guard against these shamming, shameless, God-hating and slave-making men who seek to drug and dragoon masses of decent men into their merciless dragnet of tyranny. 7 Spellman speaking at a world peace rally also blasted Yugoslavia again calling it 'the satanic Soviet sycophant which already sealed the doom of this noble humane priest.\" 8 Even the old rascal and inveterate hater of Protestantism and Protestants, Eamon De Valera jumped on the bandwagon protesting Stepinac's sentence. He claimed that the case of Archbishop Stepinac was but an instance of a campaign of persecution and he promised to make representations on behalf of religious freedom. De Valera knew as much about freedom as the Ayatollah Khomeini. Here are a group of statements, and there were more, made by Roman Catholic leaders and prelates all in defense of one of the greatest efforts at ethnic cleansing made up to that time in the Twentieth-century and they all manage to use semantics to create the impression that they are concerned about freedom. Stepinac was opposed to freedom violently and hatefully. He had no idea of what freedom really means and he did everything in his power to destroy the freedoms of those who refused to knuckle under to his hideous religious dictatorship. The effect of such semantics and propaganda was the complete deception of Protestants. Even men, one would have thought might know better, were completely befuddled by Mystery Babylon's pious lying prattle.

Priests and fanatical people were out not only to disturb me but to attack my person openly.\" 9 The amount of Vatican activity in the United States at this time was considerable. To give one example, on one single day in June, 1949, Pope Plus XII received five US generals in successive audiences: General Mark Clark, war-time Commander of the US Fifth Army in Italy, and subsequently Commander in the Korean war which was about to begin; Lieut- General J. Cannon, Commanding General of the US Air Force in Europe; Major-General Robert Douglas, Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces in Europe; Major-General Maxwell Taylor, Deputy Commander, of the European Command; and Lieut-General Geoffrey Keyes, Commanding General of the US forces in Austria. As Manhattan observed about this unprecedented series of papal audiences: \"All these went to see, not the self-styled papal Prince of Peace; they went to talk with the Pope, like them, a man of war.\" 10 The Vatican within a very short space of time had developed the most intimate relations with men in high military positions in the United States.

Prompting all kinds of questions about the role of the US and NATO in present day Yugoslavia. NATO was supposedly formed as a DEFENSE organization against the possibility of attack by the Soviet Union. Now it has become an AGGRESSOR FOR PEACE according to its contemporary spokesmen. Francis Matthews was no Orange man from Ulster. He was a very powerful man at that time in the US government. He was none other than the Secretary of the US Navy. He was also a fanatical Roman Catholic who was honored many times for his services to the Roman Catholic church. He was also head of the whole US organization of the Knights of Columbus, and if that was not enough, he was nothing less than a secret Papal Chamberlain of Pope Pius XII. The AGGRESSORS for \"peace\" have finally achieved their goal: the involving of the US and NATO in the punishing of Yugoslavia for putting on trial the cruel Archbishop Stepinac. It has taken about fifty years for Rome to achieve its malignant ends. But that is nothing to the Vatican whose long term goals include the subjugation of the entire world to the feet of the Roman Pontiff. References 1. Manhattan, Avro, Catholic Terror Today .

The Serbs were bombed for defending their own country against a cruel and belligerent enemy out to drive them out of their own country. It is nothing short of amazing how NATO and the US reached the conclusion that there was only one side in this struggle. As the truth now unfolds it is apparent that the US and NATO have helped the KLA in their murderous plan of ethnic cleansing.

Now that the campaign of NATO and the US has ended one can look at what has been achieved by this powerful alliance. USA Today reported on August 10, 1999, several months after the bombing campaign ended that the situation in Kosovo is one of massacres and violence. In the weeks since the Kosovo war (it was not a war it was murder on a national scale) ended, ethnic Serbs have been leaving the province by the tens of thousands-- expressing with their feet what they think of NATO'S promise to protect them, their churches, and homes. They have reason to be mistrustful. About 150 Serbian men and women have been killed- shot, knifed, mutilated in typical Balkan style- by ethnic Albanians since NATO troops entered Kosovo on June 12... The largest scale killings took place three weeks ago when 14 Serbian farmers were gunned down within earshot of British troops. That atrocity serves as potent microcosm for all of Kosovo. An estimated 150,000 of 200,000 Serbs have fled in fear. 3 Like the North of Ireland's IRA, the KLA were to turn in their arms as part of the \"peace\" deal worked out by NATO. Yet the USA Today reports that the KLA \"is implicated in much of the violence.\" What the USA Today fails to report is the amount of Islamic hatred that exists in Kosovo. As the mortar rounds and grenades still continue to fall upon Serbs civilians it is becoming obvious that the KLA have only made a token move in the turning in of their weapons.

He said that free societies had great difficulty in dealing with any kind of terrorism, and that the US was going to be drawn into what he called the \"Maelstrom\" of terrorist activity in the near future. He noted a few things about terrorism which are well worth repeating. He said that certain governments feed anti-US terrorist groups and that they are well equipped by these governments with small arms, mortars, and larger capability to deal destructive hammer blows to free societies. He also noted that Terrorists are very difficult to defeat. He mentioned the IRA in Ulster as an example. He said that terrorist groups operate clandestinely which makes retaliation difficult if not impossible. The guilty party seeks to remain unknown. Moves about underground and from one country to another. Moves in and out of various other terrorist organizations. Has the help of the disaffected in the targeted community. He said that Terrorism Calculus is very involved. It now has global capability and it would carry its war to the United States. He said terrorism was the only way that the US can be attacked. The various Islamic countries, who hate the US, cannot confront the US head on for obvious reasons. So they confront by clandestine terrorism and this is what they intend to do. -18-"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"So why the US and NATO would join together to help Islamic Jihad in Kosovo is somewhat of a mystery. Especially in light of the Islamic Jihad now going on in Dagestan the next door neighbor of Chechyna. The Islamic militants from Chechyna have now spilled over the border into Dagestan and are trying to export their Islamic Jihad to that small republic in the Caucasus. The goal in both Chechyna and Dagestan is to set up a totally Islamic state in both countries. Russia is now involved in a war with the Islamic militants in Chechyna. What a totally Islamic state means is that there is ABSOLUTELY NO FREEDOM FOR ANYONE WHO IS NOT ISLAMIC! There can be no public displays of any other faith, other than Islam. This is not all. Everyone in such a state will be governed by the teachings of the Koran. The Islamic way of life is to be followed. No open repudiation of such a life-style is allowed! In Kosovo, the US and NATO have joined with Islam to defeat the Serbs who are at least nominally \"Christian.\" Iran is certainly lurking in the background of the Kosovo problem. Rome is also up to her ears in the on going struggle in Yugoslavia. The powerful Roman Catholic family of Karl Von Hapsburg, which is a key player in the European Community, is hostile to the Serbian Orthodox. Iran, supports the Muslims of Kosovo, and is looking to soften the harsh relationship with the US that now exists. The US may use Iran in its troubles with Iraq and Saddam Hussein. So some kind of trade-off may be in the works. The Albanians in Kosovo are Islamic. They have been working for years to make Kosovo totally Islamic and to become the first totally Islamic state in Europe. Since 1979 when Tito died the Kosovars have committed an unending stream of atrocities against the Serbs. No international news media blitz reported these atrocities. The Kosovars have one goal in mind to make Kosovo an Islamic stronghold. NATO and the US have now entered the picture to help the Islamic thugs gain their prize. President Clinton used every opportunity to paint a picture of Serbian aggression against the Kosovars. He also tried to graphically depict a horror story of massacres and genocide. President Clinton has been shown to be a man who can lie under oath, so how anyone could believe his exaggerations about the Serbs is indeed incredible. As time has gone on the numbers of the massacred keeps being reduced. The exaggerated accounts of thousands -19-"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"massacred have not been proven. Recent estimates given in the press has reduced the number to 10,000. 6 Even that number cannot be documented. The real number killed which was supposed to justify the armed aggression against the Serbs was probably two or three thousand. Of these most were killed in battles with the Serbs. Some of the bodies also were Serbians killed in the fighting. Around one thousand Serbs were killed in these on-going battles. Criminal KLA rebels fought the security forces killing hundreds, just like the IRA in Ulster. Such things of course are not reported too widely in the western press. President Clinton carries on as if his policies in Ulster and Kosovo are great successes, when in reality they are complete fiascoes. President Clinton supports Gerry Adams the leader of the Sinn-Fein IRA in Ulster; and supports The Snake, the leader of the murderous KLA gangsters in Kosovo, while ignoring the governments in both countries. The crucial problem facing countries trying to put down armed rebellions is the attention span of this generation. A story can scarcely unfold before it is removed off the front page and forgotten, no matter how many innocent civilians may still be in the process of being slaughtered or exiled. The tragedy of others is quickly forgotten in the pursuit of Mammon. Many in this hedonistic generation are more concerned about the next meal, the next vacation, their team's next goal, point, or run, than about millions being killed or starving to death.

There is much knowledge being disseminated but very few really do much to inform themselves independent of the news media. So if a person watches the news on television he merely gets what certain big corporations who control the news media, want him to hear. As one man said, the news media went out of their way to paint Slobodan Milosevic as a perpetrator of genocide. He said: Had the news media called Mr. Milosevic a \"freedom fighter\" and sponsored a grand reception for him in New York, doubtless millions would have swooned with appreciation of his sacrifices for humanity, like they did for the infamous butcher Nelson Mandela. The UN gave Idi Amin, a man who was a cannibal and kept human meat in his refrigerator, a standing ovation when he visited the UN General Assembly. In other words the news media CREATES butchers and CREATES Sunday school teachers. If it wants to denigrate someone it merely digs around until it finds whatever it needs and then works the material to whatever end it has in view. Nelson Mandela and his war against South Africa was served up beautifully. So one got the picture of a nice elderly Sunday School teacher defending the poor and oppressed; instead of man who called Fidel Castro and Omar Qadaffy two of his best friends. Everything evil that Mandela perpetrated was never reported. Every evil that the other side did was reported. Thus the reader, or hearer, of such reports comes to believe what he reads or hears. In the North of Ireland the news media is STILL maximizing Bloody Sunday which took place about 30 years ago. In this case the British Army and police were said to have OVERREACTED. That is, they shot some of the revolutionary IRA and their supporters. NOT ONE WORD HAVE I EVER READ OF BLOODY FRIDAY in which the IRA bombers blasted innocent civilians in a veritable holocaust of hatred in which twenty seven people were killed.

It was planned to -21 -"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"take as many innocent lives as possible. It was planned to KILL PEOPLE. Yet I have never heard ONE WORD from the news media since that time. So a picture of cruel police and British soldiers was sent around the world to publicize Bloody Sunday and TO KEEP PUBLICIZING IT THIRTY YEARS LATER. But Bloody Friday which was planned to kill as many innocent people as possible, is NEVER mentioned by the news media again. How does one explain such bias? The News Media can keep certain events before the public or they can make them disappear from public view. They can praise a leader or denigrate a leader. The power of the modern news media is indeed very great! What is the foreign policy of the United States today? Not even Solomon in all his glory could answer that question. Take for example the US and her dealings with Turkey. Here is a country famous for its massacres of the Armenians and famous for its on going slaughter of the Kurds? Does the US and NATO then get together to bomb such a cruel genocidal nation? No. Not only that, but the US actually helps the Turkish authorities to arrest the leader of the Kurds. Turkey has enjoyed special nation privilege now for some years in US foreign policy. While the cold war was at its height Turkey allowed the US to use its territory to establish military bases to monitor the Soviet Union. The fact that Turkey is also now a part of the European Community at least in name, also affected how Great Britain regarded her. While the US and NATO were pounding Yugoslavia for its alleged human rights violations, they totally ignored the far greater violations of Turkey toward the Kurds and the Armenians. It is nothing short of criminal bias and unprincipled conduct how the so-called Allies ignored Turkish human rights violations and maximized Milosevic's. The Turks have been massacring the Armenians now for the last one hundred years. The history of the Armenians reads like a litany of massacres. The Turks have powerful allies in the US and Britain so that their reprehensible conduct is primarily ignored in the British and US news media, while the conduct of the Serbs is put under the proverbial microscope. A few years ago Sen. Robert Byrd for instance, engaged in a filibuster on the floor of the US Senate when Sen. Robert Dole sought to introduce a resolution designating April 24, as a National Day of Remembrance commemorating the 75th Anniversary of the -22-"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Armenian Genocide carried out by the Islamic Turks against the Christian Armenians. 1 President Bush, who is a promoter of one-worldism, at that time \"felt compelled to issue a statement saying he wished to join the Armenians in a day of remembrance for the more than ONE MILLION Armenian people who were victims.\" 2 So even though Bush encouraged opposition to Dole's resolution he, probably for humanitarian reasons, had to at least recognize the awful genocidal massacre of the Armenians carried out by the Turks. One writer in commenting on modern Turkey described her in this way: It should not be forgotten that the Turkey of the 20th century is in no way a civilized European state, (and) that Asian methods are employed to rule, and that its rulers, despite their European education, are unable to free themselves of those methods (repression and extinction of minorities) because those methods are not incompatible with their innermost views. 3 This statement, while showing that Turkey is far from the model of a European state, does not pinpoint the REAL problem. The real problem simply put, is ISLAM. Islam is out for the control of the world. Where it already has control in totally Islamic states it denies freedom to all other religions. Where it does not have a totally Islamic state in place, it works day and night to achieve it by any means possible. Turkey is considered one of the GREAT Islamic nations. Pan- Turkism was the policy of Turkey earlier in this century. That is, the Turks were out to create a Turkish Empire in Asia, and that empire was to be Islamic. The fact that with the advent of modern warfare Turkey lost a great deal of its former influence, does not mean that Turkey has changed its goals. Turkey invaded Cyprus more than two decades ago and the hundreds of thousands of Greek Cypriots were driven from their homes and to this day have not been able to return. Modern Turkey for all the window-dressing is still an Islamic nation out to further the cause of Islam wherever it can. The massacres of the Armenians were ALL RELIGIOUSLY MOTIVATED. This is what the western nations will not admit. The continued slaughter of the Kurds also goes unchecked or unmonitored by the press, while those engaged in the on-going slaughter are welcomed by NATO and the US. And if that it not -23-"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"enough, they are helped by the US to capture the leader of the Kurdish Resistance! To give one some idea of the nature of the savage treatment the Armenians received at the hands of the Turks, when the Armenians were caught between the Russians on one side, and the Turks on the other, they chose to fall under the power of the cruel Red Army rather than the Turkish Army. (When the Turks) invaded Armenia, (and the Soviets) invaded from the north. Caught in a pincers between the two, rather than succumb to Turkish rule, which recent events had shown to BE SYNONYMOUS WITH EXTINCTION, the Armenian republic surrendered to the Red Army. 4 (emphasis added) To the Armenians, defeat by the Turks meant TOTAL MASSACRE by them: TOTAL EXTINCTION of the entire Armenian nation. So the hypocrisy of the western press is indeed nauseating. The western press ridicules the Serbs in an incredible show of the utmost bias and hatred, while completely ignoring the Turks who are infinitely worse than the Serbs. Western politicians join the circus of hateful diatribe against the Serbs and many many people in the western nations are deceived by the unbelievable amount of pure hype and plain lies spued out by the kind of leadership the western world is now under. President Clinton adds his hysterical words to the mix and people believe him. Unthinking people, and their numbers are legion today, lap up the lies and rejoice in the freedom of the press! The western news media like to ridicule God and creation and deride those who believe in God. But God rules in this earth. So while weak western secularists allow Turkey to massacre the Kurds, Cypriots, and Armenians, God takes notice whether they do or not! The recent devastating earthquakes in Turkey are certainly acts of God. It is instructive to note that one of Turkey's largest military bases was devastated by these earthquakes. Amos the prophet asked the question: \"Is there a calamity in the city and the Lord has not done it?\" The CIA helped the murderous Turks in arresting the Kurd leader Abdullah Ocalan. He was then given a mock trial and sentenced to death. Does the CIA then help the British and Northern Ireland forces to arrest the leader of the IRA-Sinn-Fein, Gerry Adams? No!

Does the CIA then help NATO to arrest the Kosovar Albanian hate monger, killer, and assassin, whose Nom de Guerre is THE SNAKE? No, they allow him still to carry on his Islamic Jihad against the Serbs. So how does the US government decide what rebels to support and what ones to help arrest? Since the US works to help the rebel IRA in Northern Ireland, and the rebel KLA in Kosovo why does it not help the rebel Kurds who have been massacred in far greater numbers than any other rebel force in the world? What are the criteria the Clinton Administration uses to determine its foreign policy? Certainly there seems to be little rhyme or reason to Clinton's foreign policy, except that the Vatican appears to have some say in it. Certainly the United States has backed the Vatican in many places since World War II. The US intervened in El Salvador to prop up a hideous Roman Catholic oligarchy backed by its Death Squads. But the US did not intervene in Rwanda where the Roman Catholic Hutus were engaged in massacring half a million Tutsis. France did not intervene in Rwanda until the tide turned and the Tutsis managed to get an army in exile put together to go back and stop the slaughter. Only then did the French Expeditionary Force intervene. It was only after one of the worst massacres of the Twentieth century had finally spent its strength that any intervention took place. Complete CONFUSION reigned all through the country. A Confusion caused by Mystery Confusion and her terroristic tactics.

I listened to two \"scholars\" discussing Kosovo on a television program. I tuned in toward the end so I was not able to get their names. One was said to be a professor at New York University. One of the gems I was able to extract from this \"scholarly\" assessment of the bombing of Yugoslavia was the statement made by one of these scholars to the effect that \"the International Community will now feel it should impose its will on other trouble spots of the world.\" Ominous words indeed! He was alluding to the \"successful bombing strategy\" which had finally brought Yugoslavia to its knees. One cannot help but wonder who or what is this glorious International Community spoken of so blatantly? It certainly does not include many nations. India, one of the largest nations in the world numerically, condemned the bombing of Yugoslavia. Greece, with many other smaller nations, also condemned the bombing of Yugoslavia. The US Marines when they attempted to land in Greece after the bombing debacle was over, were greeted by hundreds of demonstrators carrying placards with the words MURDERERS GO HOME printed upon them! So to glibly speak of the International Community supporting such an horrific solution to the problems of Kosovo I would suggest is slightly premature. Secondly, even if such a bombing campaign had the support of many nations it would only make the statement even worse.

A look at the map of the world will show that the most stable nations on the face of the earth have come where the Protestant Reformation succeeded. Yet the very word Protestant today carries a negative image and in many cases has been discarded. The so-called International Community at the present time is composed of NATO and the United States. NATO is a group of European Nations tied together by the Treaty of Rome. This Vatican sponsored group of nations joined by the United States are now trying to impose the will of the Vatican upon all of Europe. Yugoslavia is fragmented and blown to pieces because this suits the Vatican. The Vatican wanted Yugoslavia punished for having the temerity to put on trial the murderous rascal Stepinac; and also to facilitate the papal dominance once again in Croatia. On the other side Italy is not allowed to separate into separate states, nor is the North of Ireland going to be allowed to stay separate if the Vatican has its way. Italy in its northern industrial section wants autonomy but the Vatican opposes such a breakaway idea. The North of Ireland, Ulster, is already separate, but the Vatican wants Ireland united so that the Roman Catholics would then constitute a majority in a unified island. Roman Catholic doctrines and falsehoods would then be easier to disseminate throughout the land. So the Vatican sponsors and supports breakaway states such as Croatia, but does NOT support Ulster which is now a separate state just like Croatia, except that Ulster is basically Protestant and Croatia almost entirely Roman Catholic. One is supported the other is undermined. This is Mystery Confusion at its best. When man first sought to form a one-world-government at the time of the Tower of Babylon, it was God who sent confusion among them.

The wicked and evil bombing campaign* against Yugoslavia, to implement the Treaty of Rome orchestrated and engineered by President Clinton, has ended. It has been an awful holocaust to behold. And to think that the two nations most involved in it, were the United States and Great Britain, at one time the two most Protestant nations in the world, and the defenders of Protestantism around the world at earlier times in their histories. How the mighty are fallen! President Clinton has meddled in Ulster and in Kosovo and has not produced a lasting peace in either case. He has become without a doubt, the greatest long range warrior that history has so far produced. He fights long range. He was a man who opposed war when he thought he might actually have to fight in one. Now he has graduated from that illustrious past to become the commander-in-chief of the greatest war machine in history. Truly a frightening thought to contemplate! Why was Kosovo chosen out of all the places on earth where injustice and massacre abound? Why Kosovo? Why were the Turks allowed to be part of the war machine attacking Kosovo when their history reads like a litany of massacre and terror against the Armenians, the Kurds, and the Greeks? If a self- righteous nation wanted a score of reasons to intervene to stop injustice, murder, hate, terror, massacre and genocide, then Turkey is the greatest example of these evils of any country in the world. But Turkey was not ridiculed by the western news media; no cartoons about this evil nation. Instead Turkey is welcomed as a glorious ally to help the US and Britain carry out their diabolical plans.

The bombing was intensified rather than diminished EVEN THOUGH THE BOMBING in IRAQ was stopped for the Muslim celebration of Ramadan. -28-"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"looking at the Debacle in Kosovo certain possibilities come to the fore as to why Kosovo was targeted at this time. There are at least five plausible reasons why this debacle took place at this juncture in history: 1. President Clinton has been completely overwhelmed by scandal after scandal during his time in office. He is said to be a man concerned about his place in history. So he had to do something noteworthy to leave some legacy behind other than Monica, Jennifer, and all the other scandals which up until Kosovo were really his only legacy. Kosovo was chosen then because it was looked upon as another Grenada and victory was perceived as quick and easy and Clinton would be regarded as a hero. He and Blair, in reality, discovered that victory was neither quick nor easy, and they created far more havoc and displacement in the Balkan region than anyone else. 2. There is a long range plan to unify ALL of Europe under the Treaty of Rome. This apostate-ecumenical-religious-Roman Catholic Super-State should be a matter of concern to Bible believers; but alas few seem to even notice what is happening; and even fewer seem to care. This religious-apostate monstrosity can only become worse, as Kosovo demonstrates. It can only become more dictatorial; more diabolical; more aggressive; more intolerant of true Bible- believers, as time goes on. NATO obviously wanted to show its power to implement the Treaty of Rome. What is certainly ominous for American Bible-believers, is that NATO would probably have taken much longer to achieve its goals in Kosovo if indeed it could have done so, WITHOUT AMERICAN HELP! The United States played a very key role in the implementation of the Treaty of Rome. The Vatican is now backed by both NATO and the US. Professor Arthur Noble, a European scholar, noted recently: The EU (European Union) is advancing by stealth towards (pope) John XXIII 's goal of a Roman Catholic super state. (Pope John declared 30 years ago that Europe would become the greatest Roman Catholic super state the world has ever seen.) Her present goal is unchanged- to recreate a re-mediaevalised Europe of small ineffectual states where she can easily dominate. 1 -29-"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"3. Another possible piece to the puzzle of Kosovo is the issue of Islam. By helping the KLA Islamic militants and the Islamic Albanians, the Clinton administration may be looking for some way to defuse the Islamic terrorism now being aimed at the US mainland and American installations and embassies overseas. Some think that a move is being made to reach out to Iran who might be able to help with the never-ending-other Clinton debacle in Iraq. The west is perceived in Islamic countries as pro-Israel and anti-Arab, and anti-Islam. So the issue of Islam certainly looms large in Kosovo. 4. Some analysts see the need to get rid of aging military hardware and retool and modernize the whole military establishment of the United States. What to do with thousands of pounds of aging bombs? Dredge up good reasons for a war against some helpless nation and unload the excess poundage to create the need for new weaponry. It is certainly interesting to note that the US supplied by far the major tonnage of bombs in what was really a European matter. 5. The TIMING of Kosovo was very very suspect. Why did Clinton raise his war rhetoric when he did? The crisis on the home front was the unfolding Chinese nuclear bomb secrets scandal. It was a front page news story when the bombing of Kosovo started. It moved off the front page and the bombings took center stage as the news media helped Clinton out once again. Clinton is a typical politician. Every time a threat arises on the home front, he immediately creates a new foreign escapade to deflect attention away from another one of his scandals. One writer said that when Clinton's scandals first began to unfold, he was amused. Then as they continued, he became bemused. Then as they expanded and multiplied, he became concerned. Then as they further escalated he became worried. Finally when he saw that Clinton was willing to do ANYTHING to get his scandals of the front page, he BECAME ALARMED! He saw what many others saw, that Clinton was willing to plunge the world into war, if necessary, to deflect attention away from his never ending scandals. One critic noted that the bombing of Yugoslavia got the Chinese spying scandal and the money paid by the Chinese to the Democratic party, off the front page and moved to page 4. Then as the bombing campaign increased and intensified the Chinese scandal DISAPPEARED COMPLETELY FROM THE -30-"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"NEWS! President Clinton has been beset by one scandal after another during his entire presidency. These scandals have all been of his own doing. He saw Kosovo as a possibility to salvage his beleaguered presidency, so he decided to act. He wanted to appear to be a strong Commander-in-Chief and decided to drop some bombs on Yugoslavia to achieve those ends. Why did the US and NATO not intervene in the Sudan where the genocide has been going on now for at least ten years and 1,300,000 Sudanese of the Black Christian South have been slaughtered by the Islamic North? Why was there no intervention in Rwanda where an estimated half-a million Tutsis were massacred by the Roman Catholic Hutus? Why no intervention in Turkey where the Kurds have been ethnically cleansed for years? Why no intervention in Algeria where entire villages have been hacked to death by the Islamic militants? There is a simple answer to these questions. Kosovo was chosen deliberately because it was little more than a dot on the map. At least that's what the US and NATO thought. They found out that even dots on the map are much larger in real life. But Kosovo was chosen for an easy victory seemed possible. As any one knows to intervene in any of the other situations it would have been too costly and too difficult. So the hackings and the massacres can continue and NOTHING WILL BE DONE TO STOP them. So the pious and hypocritical reasons given for intervening in Kosovo are NOT USED to justify intervention in other places where the killings, ethnic cleansings, and Islamic Jihad is much much worse. Showing that Kosovo was chosen for SOME OTHER REASON. Not the reasons given by President Clinton and the spokesmen for NATO. References 1.

The failure to separate from this evil apostate conglomerate is apparent. Many people who profess to follow the Lord Jesus Christ remain in fellowship with some of the worst apostates, refusing to obey the command and call of God.

This man is blessed of God. -34-"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"The wicked are not so. They forfeit the blessing of God. God moves slowly and deliberately. A nation does not go down as quickly as a individual. There are many people in any nation. Christians are the salt of the earth. They help to preserve a nation. Genesis reveals that God would not have destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah if He had found ten righteous people in those cities. There are still many true Christian believers in the United States. They can and should make a difference. They need to cry to the Lord - for if God's people humble themselves and seek His face, - God promises to hear them. They also need to cry out against evil wherever it is. By writing to elected officials, voicing their dissent, speaking out, and by supporting true churches, and not liberal and Christ-denying denominations, churches, and organizations. The cry of some today: \"My country right or wrong!\" Is not Scriptural nor right. True believers BELIEVE in personal ACCOUNTABILITY! They believe that people, and leaders, and yes, even Presidents are accountable for their actions and should be removed from office if their behavior and decisions are such as to produce scandal and hurt for the :country they are supposed to govern. It is FAILURE to not only call for accountability but to LIVE lives that recognize ONE'S OWN PERSONAL accountability which is weakening this great nation today. For example, many people, who profess to be Christians complain about the state of this country, who are supporting liberal churches, the Roman Catholic church, and weak and compromising evangelical churches, WITHOUT apparently seeing their own PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY for such actions. They want society to be made better but they support churches which contribute to the downgrade in society without ever apparently seeing the connection. One man, who was a very strong conservative socially, spoke with me several times when I lived in Pennsylvania. I tried to lead him out of the Roman Catholic church. He even came to hear me preach. But he ended up going back into Rome. He told me that his own priest asked him if he was a Protestant because he made his position known to the priest on various issues. But in the end he remained supportive of Rome while decrying some of the church's teachings. In other words he knew the truth but he failed to support it, or promote it PERSONALLY! The cost was to great to take a personal stand! -35-"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"There are still millions of Americans who are not too thrilled about the Vatican and its policies, but they are a silent group. So many Protestants have become befuddled by Vatican propaganda that they see only one enemy: liberalism, or Communism. So they fight that enemy with everything at their disposal. But there is no fight with religious evil, only secular evil. This can be demonstrated by the fact that many ministers and churches are concerned about the great social evils plaguing American society today. They never seem to be even aware of the spiritual evils which plague America today, much less confront them. The Reformers, and those who followed them, all viewed the Roman Catholic Mass as a great evil which plagued any society in which it was celebrated. Bucer began his reformation of the city of Strasbourg, not by cleaning up the evils of society, but by abolishing the MASS. THAT WAS THE FIRST ITEM OF REFORM! The Mass was called by Luther, an idolatrous blasphemy. Can any society be in any way reformed which continues to promote idolatrous blasphemy? Is not the promotion of idolatrous blasphemy not one of the very reasons why the REFORMATION of such evils is needed? When the first and second commandments are treated with blasphemous impunity, can any of the other commandments be regarded with sanctity? Luther said the first table of the Law takes precedence of the second table. It is of little use to cry out about the breaking of the sixth and seventh commandments if we are totally silent about the breaking of the first and second commandments. It is obviously easier to get a hearing by speaking about the breakdown of the home, the fifth and seventh commandments, and the breakdown of law and order, the sixth and eighth commandments, than it is to preach about the breaking of the first and second commandments. Every law-abiding person in society is against murder and theft. Many more are for family values; but when it comes to the first and second commandments then a minister comes into OPEN CONFLICT with all the nice religious patriotic Americans who are idolaters. This is why so many ministers are silent about such egregious evil. It is easy in just about any church building to lambast the evils of society; much more demanding to speak of the EVILS OF -36-"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"FALSE RELIGION! This is why every television preacher is silent on the great religious evils of our times; his support would dry up almost overnight if he even dared to MENTION such evils, much less preach an entire message on them. Yet we see that Israel came under the judgement of God time and time again because of idolatry. This was the VERY SIN that stopped the blessing of God; started the judgment of God; and was the seed of all the other evils with which the nation was afflicted. Men talk about revival today; but true revival will NEVER COME while idolatry goes unreproved. Idolatry brings God's judgment WITHOUT FAIL! NEVER HIS APPROVAL! Revival always signifies the REPUDIATION of idolatry in the Old Testament. While the nation remains in an idolatrous state spiritual revival is IMPOSSIBLE! It never ceases to amaze me how so many otherwise biblically knowledgeable people can be so blind when it comes to false religion. They assume that all religions are in jeopardy in the United States today and that therefore it is necessary to come to the defense of any religion that may need it. To guarantee freedom of speech and religion certainly every religion should be able to promote its ideals peaceably. But to the Bible believer that is as far as it should go. Tolerance of a religion should NEVER be equated with APPROVAL of that religion. I can tolerate Mormonism but I can certainly NOT APPROVE IT, and will do all in my power to defeat it doctrinally and theologically. Likewise with Roman Catholicism; tolerance of Roman Catholics, should never become APPROVAL of their false religion. But this is where we are today in the United States. Instead of rigorously reproving the unscriptural nature of Purgatory, the Papacy, Works Salvation, Penance, Prayers and Masses for the dead, and other Romish errors, Protestant ministers and evangelists are uniting with those who promulgate such error and expect to be praised for such conduct. This is the great sin in America today and many other egregious errors and sins flow from it. The murder of the unborn in this nation constitutes one of the greatest genocide's, cruel holocausts, and unmitigated horrors of the twentieth century. Christians SHOULD NEVER GET USED TO, OR INURED TO, the horrible MASSACRE OF THE UNBORN. But there is something worse! The worship of Idols. Christ is replaced by idols. The Rejection of Christ is the worst sin of all. So a person may oppose abortion with all his -37-"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"might and still be lost forever without hope and without God! A nation must REAP WHAT IT SOWS. The God of the Bible states that the nations are but men. Great nations may boast of their power and glory but before the God of the Bible they are like the dust of a balance before Him. Even more, \"ALL nations before Him are as NOTHING; they are counted to Him less than nothing, and vanity\" (Isa. 40:17). God's \"therefores\" are indeed awesome to behold. When nations and individuals go on in their sins the Scriptures over and over again state: \"THEREFORE\" God did thus and so. \"Who gave Jacob for a spoil and Israel to robbers? Did not the Lord, against whom we have sinned? For they would not walk in His ways, neither were obedient to His law. THEREFORE He has poured upon him the fury of His anger and the strength of battle, that is of war, and those that set him on fire, and prevailed against them. YET NOT ONE OF THEM KNEW IT OR LAID IT TO HEART!\" (Isa. 42:24-25). The overall Protestant Christian testimony which could be generated in North America, is seriously vitiated by the compromise of millions in liberal and theologically weak denominations. They want a strong America. They want morality and justice. They want to promote family values. They want the best but stay in fellowship with the worst. Some campaign vigorously to clean up television while remaining in fellowship with their liberal denomination. Truly a philosophical and theological contradiction! Altizer even taught that God was dead and millions still remained in fellowship with such abomination. Those who do this still think THEY are for family values, morality etc, but their ACTIONS overwhelm their claims and their SPOKEN values. This nation must learn that ACTIONS always speak louder than words; and particularly so in the spiritual battle which now rages in North America. It is not enough to SPEAK OUT on family values and moral issues, while our actions betray our words. A STAND against homosexuality must be taken by separating from such evils not just speaking out against them, while remaining in close fellowship with them, and while actually supporting them financially. How many in recent days have spoken out on moral issues such as homosexuality, while remaining in close denominational fellowship with homosexuals and those who promote same-sex marriages. How many sincere \"holiness\" advocates and teachers who labor long and hard to promote what they call -38-"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"\"Scriptural Holiness\" fail to separate from the gross abominations of their own denominations. Is not the very root meaning of holiness-SEPARATION? How can any one even think about Holiness-Holy-Living- Separated-living unto the Lord-- while completely entangled in some of the worst forms of UNHOLINESS-- UNGODLINESS-- UNSANCTIFIED and morally debauched evils of this generation. Yet such gross contradictions are not only never addressed, they are never even mentioned. It is as if they do not matter, when I believe, this is the VERY REASON that the testimony of millions is ruined and virtually rendered ineffectual in the overall battle for truth. The judgment of God continues to fall upon the United States today. Yet those enamored with statistics claim that there are70,000,000 born-again Christians in The United States. Suppose for one moment, for the sake of argument, that such a statistic is close to the truth, as many Americans believe that it is, WHY DOES SUCH A LARGE NUMBER HAVE SO LITTLE EFFECT UPON THIS NATION TODAY? Surely if these 70 million people were really taking their stand with their ACTIONS as well as their WORDS this nation would feel the effect of such a stand in many ways. Yet when I attend the American Council of Christian churches I see many many supposedly \"Bible-believing\" denominations that do not stand with such a testimony. When I look at the National Council of Churches I see millions identified with that stand. When I look at the feeble and compromising spirit of the National Association of Evangelicals I see millions identified with that weak stand. At the same time many cry out about the social evils of our times without ever addressing the crucial weakness of their OWN PERSONAL stand and convictions. This is why this nation languishes today. It languishes because many who speak out STRONGLY against certain evils IGNORE the EVILS in which they are personally entangled and not only do not stand against them, they never even raise their voice against them. And by remaining in fellowship with them actually indirectly SUPPORT AND MAINTAIN THEM! Stand in the evil day and having done ALL! STAND! It is the hardship, reproach, and even persecution which accompanies a Scriptural stand that so many flee from today. The comforts of Mystery Babylon religion are too attractive; the hardships of a Scriptural stand too demanding. So many remain in the fellowship of ecclesiastical entanglements while -39-"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"SPEAKING OUT STRONGLY against certain evils. Such voices are rendered futile by the spineless life which accompanies them. The Apostles were those who turned the world upside own so that it was right side up; now the church merely goes along with not only the evils of society, but the evils of the visible church. It has been turned upside down by the world; instead of being the power of God which turns the world upside down. There are many in North America today who think they understand the nature of the battle for truth, but who do not understand it at all. The battle of the true Christian is seen in the battle between Christ's body- the true church, and Mystery Babylon religion. So a man may be against the Masons and still be part of Mystery Babylon religion. He may be against Communism and still be part of Mystery Babylon religion. He may be against the Insider Conspiracy and still be part of Mystery Babylon religion. He may be against the Council of Foreign Relations and still be part of Mystery Babylon religion. He may be against Islam and still be part of Mystery Babylon religion. He may be against secular humanism and still be part of Mystery Babylon religion. Many Americans today see the great apostate conglomerate only in relation to the United States, not in relation to God's people. This is what the Bible declares: that God's people are to come out of Mystery Babylon religion. It is Mystery Babylon religion which is arrayed against God's elect people, and the core of Mystery Babylon is the system of papal Rome. Many unclean and evil spirits go to make up the great cage of the worldwide apostate conglomerate, but its seat is obviously ROME! \"Wherefore come out of her my people, that you be not partaker of her sins, and that you receive not of her plagues...
