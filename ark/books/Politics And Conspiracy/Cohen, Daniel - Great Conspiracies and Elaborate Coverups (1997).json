They have chased motorists, appeared mysteriously in the vicinity of grisly crimes, exchanged gunf ire with angry citizens, and sprayed unknown chemicals that have killed pets, plants, and livestock. Government agencies regular ly deny that such vehicles exist. Despite hundreds or thousands of these sightings the major me dia never report on them. Have th e media been silenced about this phenomenon? Is there a conspiracy? Is there a cover-up? Did you know that the core of Washington, D. C., is laid out according to a \"secret Ma sonic ritual\"? By st udying street maps o f Washington you can find an entire pent agram traced out focusing on the White Hous e, and a satanic horned goat traced around the Capitol. These are symbols that are used to conjure up evil spirits, and open a \"spiritual door to the occult, a planned invasion of the powers of darkness,\" and the nation has \"been unde r siege from the first day our first president walked into th e Oval Office.\" 1 Did you know that despite the \"official\" finding that Marilyn Monroe committe d suicide by swallowing an overdose of b arbiturate pills, no trace of them was found in her body? Did you know that hundred s of hours of secret tape recordings of Marilyn that had been made by the powerful and unscrupulous head of the Federa l Bureau of Investigation (FBI), J. Edgar Hoover, have mysteriously disappeared, and Marilyn's diary and other incriminati ng evidence were removed from the house b efore police arrived on the scene? And, most shocking of all, did you know that Robert F. Kennedy, attorney general of the United States and brother of President John F. Kennedy, was at Marilyn's house when she died? Perhaps you didn't know all the details of the invasion of bl ack helicopters, the Masonic se crets of Washington, and the murder of Marilyn Monroe, but I'll bet you' ve heard rumors. These are the sorts of ta les that are hard to avoid, even if you wa nt to. And these tales are so strange, so sinister, and ye t so exciting that few of us try to avoid them. Accounts of the appearance of mysterious unmarked \"black helicopters\" have been around for several decades now. But in recent years the accounts have in creased in frequency and have become an inte gral part of the lore of many antigovernment groups, who are convinced that there is some sort of federal gove rnment or international conspira cy to deprive them of their freedom. The black helicopters are th e air force of the conspiracy. Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan must have surprised and puzzled many of his listeners at the Million Man March in Washington, D.C., in October 1 995 when he talked about the strange Masonic or igins of Washington. A nd the description of Washington architecture as downright sata nic was contained in material distributed by the Free the Masons Ministries of Washington State. At least four books and scor es of articles have been publ ished describing the \"murder\" of Marilyn Monroe and pinning the crime on the Kennedys, the Mafia, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the FBI, or all of the above. Someone might tell you the story and then add, with a knowing wink, \"O f course it's all been covered up.\" Usually you don't hear about these conspiracies on the evening news, or read about them in the leading newspapers and magazines. They don't appear in your history textbooks either. Author Jim Hougan, w ho wrote a couple of books on conspiracies, said that there ar e two kinds of history: the safe, sanitized \"'Di sney version,' so widely available as to be unavoidable . . . and a second one that remains secret, buried and unnamed.\" 2 Authors Jonathan Vankin and John Wh alen quote Hougan ad miringly in their 50 Greatest Conspiracies of All Time . They add that the second and secret version of hist ory does have a name—it is \"conspiracy theory .\" The \"Disney versio n\" they call ''the N ew York Times version,\" \"the TV news version,\" or \"the college textbook version.\" They report, however, that they were \"heartened\" to discover the \"openness\" that so many people have to conspiracy theories. Openness is hardly the word for it. In America today large numbers of people pos itively rush to embrace any one of a huge number of conspiracy theories. Sometimes it looks as if the nation, i ndeed the entire world, is awash in cons p iracies and cove r -u p s, and that nothin g is as it"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"seems. Often the same set of facts is made to fit half a dozen different, and diam etrically opposed, conspiracy theories. Usual ly the theory a person chooses to believe depends not so much on the available information as on what that person already b elieves. Most conspiracy theories are flexible enough to fit many different points of view. For those on the political right, President John F. Kennedy was killed by a left-wing political conspiracy. For those on the left, it was a right-wing conspiracy . One problem in discussing this subject is that there really have been and doubtless still are conspiracies and cover-ups. Grou ps of individuals, organizations, corporations , and governments have gotten together and tried to do things, usually shameful or unlawful, in secret. Stories have been suppre ssed, and information burned, shredded, and buried. The Watergate affair during the presiden cy of Richard Nixon certainly comes to mind. So does the more recent Iran-Contra affair. Information about the decades-long efforts by tobacco comp anies to suppress data about the effects of cigarette smoking on health is still being slowly revealed. But the real conspi racies and cover-ups are rarely as grand, all-encompassing, or diabolically clever as those proposed by th e conspiracy theorists. President Nixon a nd his associates conspired to pull some p retty dirty political tricks, and then tried to cover up what ha d been done. But they didn't plan the assassination of Presiden t Kennedy as has sometimes been alleged. Conspiracy theories really aren't anyt hing new in American history. Fears about th e conspiratorial powers of the secretive Freemasons, or Masons, were at their height during the presidency of Andrew Jackson. Some conspiracy theories, like the one that Elvis Presley fa ked his own death and is hiding in the FBI witness protection p rogram because his life had been threatened by drug dealers, are harmless and actually quite funny. Others are not. The theory that the world is really controlled by a small cabal of Jewish bankers helped to inspire Hitler and the Nazis, with cataclysmically tragic results. It's really impossible to say whether belie f in conspiracies and cover-ups is more co mmon today than it was in the past. While it seems as if these theories attract more followers than ever before, belief can't be measured accurately. However, what we ca n say with great certainty is that the belief in conspir acies and cover-ups is still very much with us today. In order to try to understand some of thes e beliefs, where they came fr om and why they are so popular , we will look in detail a t some of the more widespread conspiracy theories. And we will start with the most widely discussed conspiracy theory in modern American history, the one in whic h almost the only people who believe the \"o fficial\" explanatio n are the officials themselves. "},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" 1 The JFK Assassination Conspiracy Virtually everyone in America who was more than ten years old on Nove mber 22, 1963, remembers exactly where he or she was when first hearing the news that President J ohn F. Kennedy had been shot in Dallas, Texas. I was just returning to the office where I worked on West 57th Street in Manhattan when I saw a group of people gathered around a newsstand listening to the radio. Groups were gathered everywhere around radios or just talking, exchanging the latest bulletins from Dallas. Pretty soon stores, offices, and theaters began to close down. I went back to the office for a s hort time, then I went home. N o one ever announced the office was closing, we all just left. The initial reaction was not sadness—that ca me later. The first reaction was shock or more accurately, surprise. How could the young and vigorous Jack Kennedy be dead, and how could he have been killed—in America! Other American presidents had been assassinated, most notably Abraham Lincol n. But the last U.S. president to be assassinated before Kennedy was William McKinley, and that was way back in 1901. By 1963 the vast majority of Americans hadn't even been born when McKinley was assassinated. Ther e had been serious assassination attempts on the lives of Presidents Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman, but few remembered them. The JFK assassination seemed not only terrible b ut a singular and utterly impr obable event in American history, even though it wasn't. Over the next few days the feeling of improbability grew stronger as the drama continued. A susp ected assassin was arrested within two hours of the killing. He turned out to be an obscure little malcont ent named Lee Harvey Oswald—a nobody. And he was supposed to have carried the killin g out with a cheap mail-order rifle. Two days later Oswald himself, surrounded by guards and TV ca mera crews, was shot while being led by guards through the b asement of a Dallas jail. The killing was shown live on national television. Th e killer was Jack Ruby, owner of a seedy Dallas nightclub—another nobody. There never was a tria l for Oswald, and while there were a num ber of investigatio ns none of them ever seemed very satisfactory. Ruby "},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" This is a photograph of Lee Harvey Oswald as he was being transferred from the city prison to the county jail. Just moments after this picture was taken, Oswald was shot and killed. Photogra phers and cameramen from across the nation recorded the unbelievable sequence of events. was tried, found guilty of murder, and sentenced to d eath. He died before his appeal was heard. To most of us it seemed not only impr obable but downright unnatural that one of the most convulsive events in modern American history could have been created by such unimportant people. And it was in this atmosphere that the most vigorous o f all American conspiracy theories grew and still flourishes to this day. More than two thousand books have been written on the subj ect of the Kennedy assassination. There have been countless magazine articles and television shows. The assassination has been one of the most popular subj ects for discussion on radio talk shows and on the Internet. Groups discussing every concei vable and many inconceivable as pects of the case communicate via e-mail, fax, telephone, letters, and well- attended conventions. As a result, more th an four out of five Americans do not b elieve the official conclusion that Oswa ld was the lone assassin. 1^ The most wi dely held opinions are that Oswald was framed or that he was part of a much wider conspiracy. Suspicions and rumors about the Kennedy assassination began to circulate almost as soon as the news broke, and they simply exploded after Oswald was killed. A Gallup Poll taken a week after the assassination showed that only 29 percent of the American public believed that Oswald had acted alone. 2 The initial suspicion was that the Comm unists, Soviets, or Cubans were behi nd the plot. Oswald himself was a highly suspicious character. Though he had enlisted in the U.S. Mari ne Corps, Oswald was an outspoken Marxist, an ideological Communist though not actually a member of the Communist part y. A short time after his disc harge from the Marines in 1959 Oswald departed for the Soviet Union. He was reasonably well treated in the Soviet Union, where defectors from the United States were rare. He worked in a Russian factory and ma rried a young Russian woman. Within two years, however, he was ready to come back to the Unit ed States with his wife. The Soviet Union a pp arentl y had disa pp ointed Lee Harve y Oswald, but he had not become disillusioned with the theor y of"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"communism. After returning to the United States, Oswald was associated with a pro-Castro Cuban group and made inquiries about going to Cuba. All of this informat ion was known almost immediately and natura lly led to early suspicions that the assassination was a Communist plot. The Soviets and the Cubans rea lized that if they were implicated in the killing of an American president the result could easi ly b e war. Both countries went to extraordinary lengths to deny a ny association with Oswald and to offer whatever proof they could that there was no conspiracy. At firs t a lot of people, particularly people in the CIA, didn't believ e them. Perhaps some still don't. But in the more than three decades since the assassination not a shred of credible evidence indicating a Communist p lot has turned up. And this in spite of an incredibly intens ive investigation by members of the intelligence community who were sure the assassination was a Communist plot. With the collapse of communism many of the records of the clandestine activities of the Soviet government have become public. They contain not a hint of a plot. Strangely, though, it wasn't the idea of a Communist conspiracy that came to grip the Americ an public. The most commonly repeated story was that the president had fallen victim to a right-wing plot. At the time Kennedy was assassinated his popularity had been rising stead ily. But there were plenty of people in America who disliked and even hated JFK. He was a pr esident who stirred deep po litical passions, pro and con. Kennedy's most vocal foes were on the political right, and Da llas was a conservative city and home to many right-wing groups. The atmosphere of speculation and rumor had grown so intense and so dangerous th at within a week the new president, Lyndon Johnson, appointed a commission headed by Earl Warren, chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, to fully investigate the assassination. The Warren Commission had an unlimited mandate and virtually unpr ecedented powers. It was supposed to answer all of the public's questions about what had happened in Dallas on that fateful day. The final 888-page report was issued on September 27, 1964, some ten months after the assassination. The Warren Commission conclusion was that Lee Harvey Oswald had fired the shot th at killed Kennedy and that he had acted alone—there was no conspiracy. The initial media reaction to the Warren Commission report in the United States was highly favorable. But the public at large was far mo re suspicious of \"official explanations,\" and soon criti cs were picking the report to p ieces. In the months following the assassination a whole network of amateur investigators sprang up. They collected and shared information and often misinformation about the assassination, and they passionately be lieved and argued that all the questions had not been answered. The list of unansw ered questions and alternative theories compiled by these \"assassination buffs\" was formidable and, as far as the general pub lic was concerned, ve ry impressive. The Warren Commission hurt its own credibili ty in a variety of ways. The commission was supposed to have had access to all relevant information. As it turned out this was not the case. Both the CIA and the FB I withheld significant material from the commission. For example, the CIA did not disc lose to the commission the fact that it had plotted with members of the Mafia to kill Fidel Castro. That would ce rtainly have given Castro a motive to have Kenne dy killed. In the end, the information that had b een withheld would not have changed the Warren Commission conclusion that Oswald ha d acted alone. But the fact that such information had been withheld led conspiracy theorist s to ask, not unreasonably, what else was being hidden. The most outrageous, gaudiest, and meanest of the conspiracy theories was the one pr omoted by New Orleans district attorney Jim Garrison. Oswald had been born in New Orleans, and though he had moved frequently he had returned to the city from time to time, including a visit shortly before the assassi nation. Oswald's New Orleans connections had been closely investigated by the FBI and the Warren Commissi on as well as by the assassination buffs. Garrison was the sort of politician who is most politely described as ''controve rsial.\" He was known for making sensational charges and then being unable to follow them up with evidence. Garrison had taken an active inte rest in the assassination from the start. In late 1966 the district attorney shocked the nation and his own staff when he said that he was going to investigat e Clay Shaw, a prominent New Orleans civic leader, as a key figure in the plot to assassinate Kennedy. He contended it was a homosexual plot, a sort of \"thrill kill ing.\" Shaw was known to be a homosexual. 3 The whole homosexual pl ot idea grew out of stories told by some unbeli evably unreliable witnesses that Oswald was a homosexual. Later Garrison was to assert, without a single shred of credible evid ence, that Jack Ruby wa s also a homosexual. As soon as Garrison's investigation was announced, he became a me dia star, not only in New Orleans but throughout the country. And he was a celebrity and majo r focus for the legion of assassina- "},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" In the film JFK , the actor Kevin Costner stars as Jim Garris on. When the film was released, many cri tics charged that it was irresponsible of Oliver Stone to have produced a major motion picture based upon the tw isted and sometimes downright untr ue allegations of Jim Garrison . tion buffs. As time went on, Garrison expa nded his conspiracy. At one point he said it \"was a Nazi ope ration whose sponsors included some of the oil rich millionaires in Texas.\" 4 At other times, Garrison targeted the right-wing Minutemen, the CIA, the FBI, White Russi ans, and anti-Castro Cubans. Anyone who disagreed with him or his inve stigation automatically became part of the conspir acy and cover-up. This included President Lyndon Johnson, the Warren Commission, and even the mu rdered president's brother Robert Kennedy. \"It is quite apparent to me,\" Garrison said, \"that fo r one reason or another, he [Robert Kenne dy] does not want the truth to be brought out.\" 5 For years, Garrison went around floating ever wilder conspiracy tales before a fascinated Americ an public. Finally, early in 1969, Clay Shaw was brought to trial, and Ji m Garrison had to present his evidence in court and not on the Tonight show. The trial lasted about five weeks. Jury deli berations took forty-five minut es. Shaw was acquitted on the first ballot. Garrison's c ase was revealed as a complete sham. But still this wasn't the end. Two days later, Garrison had Shaw rearrested on perjury charges. It was another two years befor e a federal court issued an inj unction against Garrison from prosecuting Shaw. Garrison appealed to the Supreme Court. When he was turned down he said that he was being made a \"scape goat,\" that the CIA had murdered Kennedy, and that the Supreme Court decision \"puts the final nail in John Kennedy's coffin.\" When Garrison was not reelecte d as district attorney, he complained that the CIA and FBI had c onspired to bring about his defeat. Clay Shaw was never convicted of anything, but he spent ye ars under a legal cloud and was bankr upted by his legal bills. He filed a multimillion-dolla r lawsuit against Garrison and his financial backer s. A group of wealthy New Orleans residents had raised money for the Garrison investigation. But Shaw died in 1974, before his case coul d be brought to trial. He was a broken man, and a completely innocent one. The Garr ison investigation was a shameful episode, and it grew out of public fascination with conspiracy theories. Despite his defeat, Jim Garrison went on to write a book, On the Trail of the Assassins, in which he recycled all of his theori es. This book itself wasn't ver y successful, but it became the basis for Oliver Stone's extremel y successful 1991 film JF K .

An entire ge neration learned much of what it knows about the Kennedy assassination from that film. And th e film, which is extremely powerful and persuasive, is also dead wrong. The more serious conspiracy buffs had become disillusioned with Jim Garrison and his phony prosecution. But they continued to peck away at the Oswald-as-the-lone-assassin explanati on. In 1976 a special congressional i nvestigation was launched to look into the assassinations of Presiden t Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr. The i nvestigation took more than two years and cost over five million dollars. The conclusion was that a conspira cy in the King assassination wa s likely and that a conspiracy in the Kennedy assassination was a possibility. The most probable conspirators in the Kennedy killing according to this report were members of the Mafia. The reason the Mafia wanted to kill the president was that they hated his brother Robert Kennedy, who as attorney general was waging a campaign against orga nized crime. Jack Ruby was also supposed to have mob connections, and his killing of Oswald \"h ad all the earmarks of a mob hit.\" For a while the Mafia replaced the CIA and the Cubans as chief suspects. A whole flock of alle ged hit men have either been accused of the killing or have actually confessed to it. But there is abso lutely no solid evidence linking the Mafia to the assassination. Historic ally the mob has no scruples about killing their ri vals or people who owe them money or who have double-crossed them. But they don't assassinate judges, FBI agents, or even reporters. It's just too risky. It is unthinkable t hat they would even consider killing a president, no matter how much they hated his brother. Every year about six million people visit De aley Plaza in Dallas where the assassinati on took place. Some of them pay seven dollars to visit the Conspiracy Museum, which opened early in 1995. The aim of the museum, according to its director Tom Bowden, is to get people to think. \"Maybe that way we can correct the textbooks so that they contain information about the larger conspiracy.\" 6 The Kennedy assassination has become an obsession and nearly a religion to many as well as a moneymaking business for some. Nonetheless, a good number of American s cling to the assassination conspiracy th eory simply because it helps to make sense out of an otherw ise senseless event. "},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" This illustration, produced for one of the many illustrated weekly newsmagazines of the mid-1860s, shows the artist's rendition of Booth shooting Lincoln in the box at Ford's Theatre. 2 The Lincoln Assassination Conspiracy Before the Kennedy assassination, there wa s the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. To many Americans there is an almost mystic connection between the two awfu l events. Both the names Lincoln and Kennedy contain seven letters. The two murdered presidents were succeeded by vice presidents na med Johnson. Lincoln was elected (to his second term) in 1860. Kennedy was elected a century later in 1960. However, the Ab raham Lincoln assassination r eally was the result of a conspiracy. The question is, how large a cons piracy and who was really behind it? First, the known facts: On Ap ril 14, 1865, President Abraham Lincoln, newly in augurated for his second term, attended a p erformance at Ford's Theatre in Wash ington, D.C. During the performance J ohn Wilkes Booth, a well-known actor and a member of America's leading th eatrical family, walked unquestioned into the president's private box, pointed his derringer b ehind the president's ear, and shot. He then jumped to the stag e in what he must have visualized as a triumphant, dramatic leap. But the spur of Booth's boot caught on some bunting th at decorated the president's box and he landed awkwardly, fracturing his shin. In the general confusi on he still managed to escape from the thea ter. Lincoln was carried to a nearby hous e, where he died a few hours later. The conspirators had planned a triple assa ssination. George Atzerodt got drunk and didn' t even attempt to kill Vice President Andrew Johnson. Lewis Paine stabbed Secretary of State Wi lliam H. Seward and seriously wounded him, but Seward recovered. Booth and an associate, David Herold, managed to flee to Maryland, where a docto r, possibly a member of the conspiratorial group, set his leg. After twel ve days Booth and Herold were fi nally surrounded by soldiers in the barn of Garrett's Farm in Bowling Green, Virginia. Herold surrendered. \"I'll shoot it out with the whole damned detachment,\" Booth cried. The barn was set afire, and Booth was shot by Sergeant Boston Corbett. A few months later the conspira tors who had been arrested we nt on trial and were convicte d. Four were hanged and others given prison sentences. The version of the Lincol n assassination that has come down to us throu g h most histor y books is that it was entirel y the work"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"of Booth—an egomaniacal, drunken, and fana tical actor. All the others were a motl ey crew of drunkards and fools under the control of the half-crazed Booth. And there is considerable truth to this version. Booth was undoubtedly both self-centered and unbalanced. The Ma ryland-raised actor was a he avy drinker and a fanatic supporter of the Confederate ca use—not fanatic enough, however, to abandon his lu crative acting career in the North and join the Confederate army during the Civil War. N one of his associates was particularly br ight and some, like the loutish Atzerodt, could easily be considered of below av erage intelligence. The flamboyant acto r dominated and controlled them. But from the moment the news of the president's assassination spread, there were hints, and so metimes shouts, of a wider and more sinister conspiracy. In order to understand this reaction it is necessary to understand the time. Just a week before the assassination, Robert E. Lee had su rrendered. The war was essentially over, though some fighting continued. Although Washington was the nation's capital, it was located on the bor der between the North and South, and was really more of a Southern city. It was loaded with Southe rn sympathizers and spies. Passage between North and South, even during the height of the war, was quite easy. At the time it was assumed that the conspiracy to Kill Lincol n involved many more individuals than Booth and the handful of nonentities who were ultimately convicted a nd punished for the crime. In fact, Jefferson Davis, pr esident of the Confederacy, and a few other high Confederate officials were originally indicted as part of a conspiracy, but these indictments were eventually dropped. John Surratt, one of the conspirators w ho managed to escape to Europe, told friends that the plot had been hatched on the orders of Davis. Surratt was captured in Europe two years after the assassination, br ought back for trial in the United States, and acquitted on a technicality, although his mother, who ha d far less to do with the plot, had been hanged. Booth had met with Confederate agents in Canada before he planned the assassina tion. A number of the other conspirators were known to be Confederate agents. Confederate codebooks a nd other incriminating material s were found in the possession of some of the conspirators. It was also said that Booth was a member of a se cretive underground group called the Knights of the Golden Circle, who were fanatical Northern supporters of the Confederate cause. But lit tle is known of the group. If the Lincoln assassination had been a la rge and well-planned conspiracy, then it is reasonable to assume that Booth and the others would have had a well-pl anned escape. Clearly this was not supposed to be a suicide mission. Incredibly, Booth was able to escape from the city of Washingt on and ride south; he did get some he lp from Confederate supporters and perhaps some co-conspirators along the way. But basically he was on his own. Perhaps there had been a broader plan on ce—but after Lee's surrender that would ha ve collapsed. All the evidence indicates that in the end Booth and his followers did not have much organized support. John Surratt, his mother, and several othe rs involved in the assassination conspiracy were Catholic. When Surratt first escaped from the United States, he was hidden by so me priests in Candada. In Europe he we nt to Rome and joined the papal guard under an assumed name. However, after he was identified, the pope 's chancellor had him arrested and returned to America. In the mid-nineteenth century, anti -Catholic feeling ran strong in predominantly Pr otestant America, and there was a widespread b elief that the Vatican wa s somehow responsible for the Lincoln assassinati on. For some in America it seemed as if the Vatican was responsible for every evil deed in the world. Howe ver, a Vatican conspiracy behi nd the Lincoln a ssassination was an idea that never really got off the ground. Booth, incidentally, was an Episcopalia n and as a young man had been a member of the virulently anti-Catholic Know N othing movement. Most people have assumed, and still assume, that there was a wider Confederate conspiracy be hind the assassination. At the very least there is a belief that Confeder ate higher-ups had some knowle dge of what Booth planned, but did nothing to stop it. This may have been covered up by a victorious federal government more anxious to heal the wounds of war than simply to p unish the enemy. But this is not a very sensational theory. What has grabbed the public imagination is the theory that some of Lincoln's own governme nt, his Cabinet members, his friends, and even his family were part of a conspiracy and a cover-up. There are a num ber of troubling and suspicious elements in the Lincoln assassination. First and foremost is the poor secu rity. Booth was able to walk into the president's box and shoo t him. The outbreak of war hardl y im p roved matters. Death threats arrived almost dail y , and there were a cou p le of serious attem p ts"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"on Lincoln's life. It was later discovered that one of these at tempts was made by John Wilkes Booth, who actually managed to shoot the president's famous top hat off. Yet when Lincoln went to Ford's Theatre that fatal evening, there was only one guard assigned to him, and this guard had wandered off in search of a drink. 1 The guard was a policeman name d John Parker. He had a reputation as an incomp etent and a drunk, yet just a week before the assassination he had been recommended fo r duty at the White House by Mary Todd Lincoln, the president's wife. For some reason Parker's possible ro le in the assassination, if any, wa s not investigated, or if it wa s the results were never made publ ic. Mary Todd Lincoln was not a popular figur e in Washington, and there were even rumors that she was a Southern sympathizer—rumors that are totally unfounded. Shortly before his own death in 1926, Lincoln's son Robert Todd Lincoln burned a large mass of his father's papers. He told a friend that the documents contained eviden ce of the treason of a member of his cabi net and he thought it was best for everyone that such evidence be destroyed. There has been no way to verify this intriguing statement. After shooting Lincoln, Booth was able not only to get out of the theater without anyone stopping him, but to get clean out of Washington without being seen. The city was still under wartime conditions and the ex it roads were guarded, yet none of the guards reported seeing Booth. On the night of the assassination the commercial telegraph lines in Washington—controlled by the government in wartime— went dead, delaying news of Booth's escape. The search for Booth was so badly organized that it reads like a catalog of errors. It's not unreasonable to conclude that if the assassin had not injured his leg ju mping from Lincoln's box he might well have gotten clean away. When the pursuing soldiers finally trapped Booth and his companion, they were under stri ct orders to take the actor alive if a t all possible. The barn was set afire in order to smoke Booth out, but before that could happe n the assassin was shot. The man who claimed credit for killing Booth was Sergeant Boston Corbe tt, the Jack Ruby of the Linc oln assassination. He was a strange man—a genuine religious fanatic w ho said he killed Booth on orders from God. Despit e disobeying orders about taking the assassin alive, Corbett was gi ven a reward and briefly became a well-know n and popular lecturer. He got a job as sergeant at arms for the Kansas legislat ure, but one day he went completely bers erk and began shooting up the chamber. He was confined to a mental institution, but then escaped and disappeared. The best witness to the Linc oln assassination—the assassin hi mself—was dead, and anything he could have told investigators about the plot was lost. But Booth was carrying a diary. This was taken to Washington, tu rned over to the War Department , and then it seems to have b een lost for years. When it finally tu rned up again, it created a storm because eighteen pages—the critical pages covering events leading up to the assassi nation—had been torn out. The soldiers who f ound the diary swore that it had been undamaged when they first turned it in. These are just some of the strange and suspicious events surrounding Lincoln's assass ination. They can all be explained away as the result of confusion, coincidence, and incompetence. But true conspiracy theorist s do not recognize confusion, coincidence, and incompetence—they see only a massive and smoothly running conspira cy. In 1937, historian Otto Eisenschiml announced that the man behind the plot was Lincoln's secretary of war, Edwin M. Stanton. There is no doubt Stanton was a powerful man. He was primarily responsible for protecting the pr esident, so the failures in p rotection may ultimately be laid at hi s doorstep. He was also in charge of i nvestigation of the assassination and the apprehension of the conspirators. Indeed, in the days and we eks following Lincoln's assassin ation, Stanton exercised near- dictatorial powers. And he made mistakes—but were they just mistakes? ask the c onspiracy theorists. Why would Stanton have wanted Lincoln killed? The theory is that St anton, a radical Republican, opposed Lincoln's conciliatory policies toward the defeated Confederacy. He wanted to see the rebe ls severely punished. But what possible connection could there be between such a man and the fanatic Confederate supporter Booth? Conspiracy theorists generally avoid this fundamental question. The fallback position is that wh ile Stanton and Booth did not actua lly conspire together, the secr etary of war knew of Booth's p lans and allowed the assassination to take place. That is slightly more plausible but still fa r -fetched. There is, in fact, evidence that Stanton did not want Lincoln to go to Ford's Theatre on th e fatal night, but that the president brushed aside his concerns . Lincoln was a fatalist. He beli eved that if someone reall y wanted to kill y ou, then the y would p robabl y do so. He was"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"notoriously unconcerned about his personal safety. One of the most intriguing allegations of th e Lincoln assassination conspiracy theory is that John Wilkes Booth was not shot at Garrett's farm—that the dying man dragged fr om the burning barn was someone else. B ooth was said to have escaped. He was p laced in locations as diverse as the Amer ican Southwest, Mexico, and Europe and most improbably I ndia, where, it was said, he lived to a comfortable old age on a la rge and secret government pension. Women claiming to have been Booth's wives, men and women swearing they were Booth's children, and several old men claiming to have been Booth himself surfac ed regularly in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. During the 1920s the mummified remains of a derelict pain ter named John St. Helen were trucked around the carnival circuit as the remains of John Wilkes Booth. This gruesome relic may still be on display somewhere. In 1996 a lawyer petitioned to have the remains of John Wilkes Booth exhumed and subjected to DNA testing to see if the man b uried in the grave was really Booth. This request was rejected, but it did get a lot of press coverage. The theory that there was a vast conspiracy and a vast cove r-up of the Lincoln assa ssination has become a permanent part of American lore. "},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" 3 The Illuminati Conspiracy What may be the longest-running conspiracy theory in Am erican history began on Sunday morning May 9, 1798, when the Reverend Jedidah Morse electrified and terr ified his parishioners at the Congregat ionalist First Church of Charlestown, Massachusetts. He warned them that there was a secret group of evil men that were plotting to destroy Christianity and all legitimate governments. Their agents, he sa id, were already at work in the United States infiltrat ing schools, political clubs, newspapers, even the U.S. post of fice. Their aim was to erode reli gious faith and patriotism. Who were these evil men? According to the Reverend Morse they were the Order of the Illuminati. It is not known how many, if any, of those who list ened to the sermon on that May morning had ever Adam Weishaupt, found er of the Order of the Illuminati. even heard of the Illuminati. But within just a few months n early everybody in the new United St ates had heard of them, and a genuine panic developed, particularly in New England. The group called the Order of the Illumina ti (illuminated or enlightened ones) was formed about 1776 by Adam Weishaupt, a p rofessor of canon law at Ingolstadt Univer sity in Bavaria, Germany. Inspired by freethinking philosophers like Voltaire, the group's stated aim was to free humanity fr om ''tyranny.\" For the Illuminati, this meant replacing Bava ria's church-state hierarch y with an e g alitarian societ y based on \"reason.\""},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":" Weishaupt also had a mystical side and wa s heavily influenced by the Freemasons, or Masons (more about them in Chapter 4). The Order of the Illuminati was a secret society with a strict hierarchy. Weishaupt de vised elaborate ritual s and secret signs f or his group, and he attempted to re cruit members from Masonic lodge s. Just how large the Order of the Illuminati became is difficult to determine. Deeply committed members may have been limited to Weishaupt and a few friends. There are some estimates that at its height the Illumina ti may have had as many as 2,500 members, but the records are so foggy and unreliable that no one really knows. In 1784 the highly conservative Duke Karl Theodor became Bavaria's ch ief of state, and he began an investigation of the Illuminati, the Freemasons , and other suspect organizations. Weishaupt lost his position at th e university and fled the country . In 1787 the duke came down hard on the Illuminati. The order was banned, and those who were members faced exile or, in some cases, death. At this point the Illuminati simply disapp eared from the historical recor d, probably because the organizatio n disintegrated in the face of th e onslaught. Weishaupt himself was ultimately rec onciled with the Catholic Church before his death. Why did this obscure European organization cr eate a conspiracy scare in the United Stat es some eleven years after it ceased to exist? The reason was the French Revolution of 1789, which rea lly did overthrow church and state and traumatized many in Europe and the United States as well. But there were many persons who, rather than trying to understand the vast and complicated interplay of forces that brought about an event as momentous as the French Revol ution, found it simpler and more satisfying to blame a conspiracy. James Robison, a well-known Scottish scientis t and mathematician, gathered together al l that had ever been said about the Illuminati primarily by it s enemies, added his own paranoid notions, and came up with a book called Proofs of a Conspiracy A gainst All Religions and Governments of Europe . It is a masterpiece of conspiracy theory. Robison said that the Illumi nati had not really been crushed in 1787, but had merely gone underground, and the obscure Bavarian professor was the sini ster genius behind the French Revolution and practically ever ything else that was plaguing Europe. The book was filled with all sorts of sensational charges. It said that the Il luminati had developed a detailed plan fo r killing all the aristocrats and priests in Europe, and that the order possessed an arsenal of what would have then been considered high-tech weapons like exploding boxes and poison gas. Many Americans, particularly conservative clergymen like the Reverend Morse, blamed the French Revolution for a rising tide of religious skepticism in America. For them Robison's b ook, which first appeared in Amer ica in 1789, struck a responsive chord. Morse's sermon touched off a genuine Illu minati panic. Soon anti-I lluminati preachings came from pulpits throughout New England. The editor of the influential Porcupine's Gazette said that every living man should read Proofs of a Conspiracy b ecause \"it unravels everything th at appears mysterious in the pr ogress of the French Revolution.\" 1 The New York Spectator told its readers that they must chos e between \"INDEPENDE NCE and SUBMISSION.\" 2 Among those who thundered against the evils of the Illuminati was President Timothy Dwight of Yale. He said the Illuminati would turn American churches into Temp les of Reason, cast the Bible into the bonfir e, grind Christian virtues underfoot, and make concubines of Christian women. The Illuminati excitement had a political side as well. The conservative Fede ralist party pointed to Vice President Thomas Jefferson, a driving force in the liberal De mocratic-Republican party, as a possible Il luminati conspirator. Jefferson was an outspoken defender of France, and his religious views we re anything but orthodox. The Quakers, or Society of Friends, who we re often persecuted in early America, were singled out as probable members of the conspiracy because of their egalitarian vi ews. The United Society of Irishmen was also viewed with grave suspicion. Ironically the Freemasons, who were so central to the European id eas of the Illuminati conspirac y, were treated very gingerly at first. The Masons had many powerful members in the new Un ited States. One of America' s leading Masons was George Washington himself, a revered, almost godlike fi gure in that era of American history. There were no riots or deporta tions of suspected Illuminati. But those who fe ared the conspiracy waited anxiously for the p lotters to make their move. A year we nt by and nothing happened. So the Reverend Morse climbed back into his pulpit on April 25, 1799, and said that he now had \"complete and indisputab le proof\" of the Illuminati c onspiracy against the United States—and this time the Freemasons were central to the story. "},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Morse had been given documents indicating that the Grand Orient, France's la rgest Masonic lodge, controlled a network of some sixteen American lodges plus a se venteenth in Santo Domingo. Most of t hose in the lodges were recent French immigrants. Only the truly paranoid coul d find anything sinister in these perfec tly routine documents. But Morse and his supporters found conspira cy nonetheless. For example, the new French-dom inated lodge in Santo Domingo, which had been the scene of a successful slave revolt, was called Perfect Equality. From that it was—to Morse at least—only a short leap to a b elief that there was to be a French-led invasion from Santo Domingo in order to stir up rebe llion among American slaves. Another charge was that Weisha upt had escaped to America, where he had be en able to successfully impersonate George Washington, the real Washington having b een assassinated by Illuminati agents! As the Illuminati conspiracy theories became more widely known, they inevitably began to encounter more serious opposition. In Europe, scholars were able to show that Robison's Proofs of Conspiracy was not only wrong, it was utter nonsense. Journalists compared Morse's obsession with the Illuminati to the Salem witch tria ls. By the end of 1799 the Reverend Morse and his supporters either changed their minds or just shut up in the face of critics, and what Je fferson called their \"bedlamit e ravings\" came to an end. And that should be the end of the Illu minati conspiracy story. But it's not. Once an idea, no matter how ill-founded and downright loony, enters the stream of conspi ratorial thinking, it will resurface agai n and again in one form or another. The influential nineteenth-century mythol ogist Lewis Spence tried to give the Illuminati an an cient history. Instead of b eginning in Bavaria in the late eighteenth century, Spence traced their history back to Gnostici sm, an early Christian heresy. He said that the ideas really took root in Spain while it was still under Muslim influence, and that later many Illuminati fled to France to escape the Spanish Inquisition. Attempts to tra ce secret conspiratorial groups back hundreds and sometimes thousands of years are common. Spence's theory is colorful, almo st thrilling, but there is not one shred of reliable historical evidence to support it. Far more sinister than Spence's speculati ons are the writings of the popular conspira tologist Nesta H. Webster in the early- twentieth-century. In a series of books she attempts to link a number of secretive m ovements like the Illuminati to all manner of revolutionary upheavals. One was the French Revolution, of course, for she re lies heavily on Robison's writings, and another was the Russian Revolution of 1917. Webster's 1924 book Secret Societies and Subversive Movements concludes ringingly: \"For behind the concrete forces of revolution— whether Pan Germanic, J udaic, or Illuminist— b eyond the invisible secret circle which perhaps directs them all, is there not yet another force, still more potent, th at must be taken into account? In looking b ack over the centuries at the dark episodes that have marked th e history of the human race from its earliest origins—strange and horrible cults, waves of witchcraft, blas phemies, and desecrations—how is it possibl e to ignore the existence of an occult p ower at work in the world? Individuals, sects, or races fired with the desire of worl d -domination have provided the fighting forces of destruction, but behind them ar e the veritable powers of darkness in et ernal conflict with the powers of light.\" 3 Webster's books are still in print and stil l on the recommended reading lists of a va riety of conspiracy-m inded organizations. In the 1960s the Illuminati made another and quite bizarre reappear ance. In occult circles the rumor spread that an ancient and secretive brotherhood of Illuminati was now \"controlling world events.\" No one seemed to know who the Illuminati were or whether they were supposed to be good or evil. Two centuries after an obscure professor wa s chased out of his native Bavaria, a nd the tiny and short-lived organization he founded dissolved forever, the Illuminati lives on in the world of the conspiracy theorist. "},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":" The Jack the Ripper case was front-page news for The Illustrated Police News . This appeared after the fifth murder. 4 The Jack the Ripper Conspiracy One of the most bizarre and colorful theo ries in recent times involves a famous E nglish murderer. What makes the theory so interesting is that the conspi rators are supposed to be . . . but no, why spoi l the surprise. First let's set the scene. In the fall of 1888 a serial killer brutal ly murdered five women in the Whitechapel district of London over a period of three months. The killer, who was neve r caught, became known to hist ory as Jack the Ripper. While the crimes were savage there have, unfortunately, been even worse crime s in history. The victims themselves were not famous; they were prostitutes, desperately poor women, and mo st were alcoholics. They were the sort of people who are murdered all the time—and no one really notices. The fact that the murders remain unsolved gives them a certain fascination, b ut there are lots of unsolved crimes. Yet the obsession with the Jack the Ripper case has endured for well over a century. Perhaps it's the time and place, the stree ts of fog-shrouded late Victorian London, the city of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Perhaps it's the sinister name given to the killer—Jack the Ripper . Whatever the reason or reasons, these ar e the most famous murders in modern history. Will people still be discussing th e O.J. Simpson case in the middle of th e next century? Personally I doubt it. There have been hundreds of books, movies, televi sion dramas, and plays about Jack the Ri pper. There is a regular journal of \"Ri pp erolo gy ,\" which examines and reexamines ever y minute detail of the case. A tour of the Jack the Ri pp er sites is an"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"increasingly popular tourist a ttraction in London today. And it is inevitable that there are those who must believe a case this famous cannot just ha ve happened by accident, it can't b e an ordinary murder, it must be someth ing else—something is being covered up—t here must be a conspiracy here. After the first two murders the police were under a great deal of pressure to find the murderer—to \"do something.\" Several different police agencies as well as privat e groups were literally falling over one another in attempts to catch the murderer a nd p revent further crimes. Then on the night of September 30, 1888, ther e was another Ripper murder—in fact, tw o of them in a single night. About a five-minute walk from the scene of one of the murders, police found a piece cut from the victim's apron and above it a blurry message chalked on a wall. It read: The Juwes are not The men that Will be Blamed for nothing 1 When Sir Charles Warren, commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, arrived on the s cene he declared that the message was ''meaningless\" and ordered that it be washed away, even befo re it was photographed. This was the act that first triggered suspicions that the police were covering something up. There was a lot of graffiti chalked on the walls of Whitechapel , and there is no solid evidence that this message had anything to do with the Ripper murders. The fact that it was said to be \"blu rry\" indicates that it may have been on the wall long before th e killings. And the idea that a man who has just committed the second of two brutal murders in an area that he knows is swarming with police would hang around and chalk a messa ge on a wall seems more th an a bit far-fetched. Still, destroying a potential pi ece of evidence is not good police work, and Wa rren probably was tryi ng to cover something up—but his motives may not have been sinister in the least. The area in which the murders were committed wa s home to large numbers of poor immigrant Jews. A chief suspect in the murders was someone known as \"leather ap ron,\" thought to be a kosher butcher. There was a great deal of tension in the area and Wa rren believed, with good reason, that if the Ripper murders were linked to the Jews, a riot could easily break out. He may have wanted to avoid inflaming local passions. The last known murder by Jack the Ripper took place on November 9, 1888. Within a ve ry short time afte r that, the police essentially closed down their investigation. The special pa trols were withdrawn, and the civilian \"vigilance\" group was disbanded. Some of those involved in the investigation hinted that they knew who the Ripper was, and that he had either committed suicide or had died in an institution. The threat was over. But very quickly another rumor began to spread: The police knew the Ripper was not some obscure homicidal maniac, but a Very Important Person, whose crimes were being covered up by the authorities. One of those whose name came up in the speculation was Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence. He was a Very, Very Importa nt Person, for Prince Eddy, as he was generally called, was the grandson of Queen Vi ctoria and eldest son of the Prince of Wa les. He was therefore in direct line to b ecome king of England. You didn't get much more important than that. By most accounts Prince Eddy was a rath er dimwitted and spiritless young man whose name had been connected with a couple of earlier scandals. When he died unexpectedly of influenza in January 1892 there doubtless were private sighs of reli ef mixed with public expressions of sorrow. At least the m onarchy would be spared the embarrassmen t of such an obviously unfit individual b ecoming king. It was many decades before Prince Eddy's name really hit the headlines as a Ripper suspect. In 1970, Dr. Thomas Stowell, a retired surgeon, made public the results of re search he had made forty years earlier. He had examined the private papers of Sir William Gull, Queen Victoria's physician. Stowell did not actual ly name a suspect, calling hi m only \"S,\" but the clues were unmistakable. He said the papers indicated that \"S\" had not died of influenza as reported, but of syphilis, which had affected his brain and transformed him into an insane murderer."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":" After the excitement broke, Stowell said that he had not me ant to implicate Prince Eddy, bu t would not say whom he had meant to implicate and refused to explain all the obvious points of comparison between \"S\" and the heir to the throne. About a week after issuing this denial Stowell die d, and his family immediately destroyed all his papers, so his evidence, if there rea lly was any, could not be examined. The name of Dr. William Gull ha d come up before in connection with the Rippe r murders. Robert Lees, a journalist and p sychic at the time of the murders, insisted that he had visions of the murders and that he knew where the murderer lived. He allegedly led police to the home of a prominent physician w ho lived in an elegant West End house. And Dr. Gull was a p rominent physician who lived in an elegant West End house. It was the next step, however, that elevated the Jack the Ripper story from a simple cover-up to the higher realms of conspirac y theory. In 1973 the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) was prep aring a television special on the Ripper case. They interviewed an elderly artist named Joseph \"Hobo\" Sickert who ha d a very strange tale to tell. Back in the 1880s, Sickert's father, Walter, had been quite a well-known ar tist who had many aristocratic friends. According to Joseph, his father sa id that Prince Eddy had been sent to him for social and artistic tutoring. While visiting the artist's Bohemian studio the prince met a nd fell in love with a Catholic girl na med Anne Elizabeth Crook, who worked in a nearby tobacco shop. The pair were secretly married and had a child, a girl called Alice Margaret. When Buckingham Palace and the Cabinet got word of this, th ey were horrified. A secret ma rriage to a commoner, and a Catholic to boot, might have brought down the monarchy. Royal agen ts were dispatched to separate the pair. The prince was sent to his family and told in no uncertain terms that he w ould never see Anne and his child again. Anne apparently was kidnapped and confined to an institution, where sh e eventually died a pauper and a lunatic. The child, however, escaped in the company of her nursemaid, an Irish Catholic gi rl named Marie Jean ette Kelly. Walter Sickert was able to place the child with some poor relatives. Ev entually she became Sickert's wa rd and ultimately his mistress and the mother of Joseph Sickert. She died in 1950. N ow here's where the Ripper c onspiracy comes in. Nursemaid Kelly went back to Whitechapel, where she was reduced to alcoholism and prostitution. With the aid of three of her cronies she decided to bl ackmail the government. The prime minister, Lord Salisbury, feared that the story not only would topple the monarchy but also that it would curtail the influence that the Freemasons had over the British governme nt. Salisbury was a high -ranking Freemason, and in order to eliminate the b lackmailers he turned to some of his brother Masons. 2 The Masons (or Freemasons) are a secret soci ety that began in England in the seventee nth century. Masonic lore holds that the origins of the order can be traced back to biblical times, but there is no evidence of this. Today the center for the Masons is the United States. The order is generally acce pted as a fraternal businessmen's organi zation. The \"secret\" rituals and paraphernali a, which are not all that secret, are now regarded by most outsiders as either harmless or silly. But at some times and in some place s the Masons have been viewed with genuine suspicion and real fear. In Britain some have accused the Masons of having undue political or business influe nce, but there have been no widespread anti-Masonic panics as have occurre d in France, Italy, or Spain. Chief of the Masons enlisted to get rid of the blackmai ling women was a physician, Sir William Gull, and Sir Robert Anderson, one of the police officials in charge of the Ripper investigation. Also involved wa s a seedy coachman named John N etley. The three Masons roamed Whitechapel in Netley's coach killing the women one by one. There were supposed to be only four victims, the former nursemaid and her thr ee friends, but one innocent woman was killed because of a confusion of names. The final victim, and the one who was most horribly mutilated, was Mary Jeanette Kelly—the nursemaid herself. According to Joseph Sicker t the killings and mutilations were carried out in accordance with a Masonic ritual. They were to serve as a warning to all who would challenge the power of the Freemasons. There was a suspicion that the killings were more b rutal than necessary because Gull had lost his mind. Officially, Gull died in 1890, but there were rumors that he had become a raving madman and was secretly confined to an institution, where he died a few years later. All of this, of course, was covered u p b y hi g h-rankin g Masons in the p olice force."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":" At first glance this story seems to be absolutely absurd. And that is what th e BBC program concluded it was. But a young reporter named Stephen Knight was sent by his paper to interview Joseph Sickert. Knight claims he was very skeptical in the beginning, but the old man was so obviously sincere that he began his own investigation. Knight was a diligent and resourceful re searcher. He was able to obtain Scotland Yard documents on the case that no one had ever seen before, and the result of hi s researches, [i]Jack the Ripper: The Fina l Solution, is a genuine masterpiece of conspiracy theorizing. It has everything: th e royal family, a famous and horrible seri es of murders, an enormously powerful secret society, a high-l evel government cover-up. The book was an instant sens ation because it read like a piece of thriller fiction. There is, however, quite an ugly side to Knight's work. He relies heavily on a document called The Protocols of the Learned E lders of Zion . This document has a notorious histor y. It was fabricated by the police in Czarist Russia early in the twentieth century. It was supposed to be the plan of a secret cabal of high-ranking Jews to gain absolute power in the world by treachery and violence. It became a cornerstone of Nazi propaganda and is st ill central to much anti-Semitic conspiracy theory today. Knight, however, simply calls the Protocols a Masonic document, and says that it s hows that at least some Masons would stop at nothing—absolutely not hing—to gain and keep power. He does not discuss the sinister history of the document. Regarding the notorious Juwes graffiti that Police Commissioner Warren ordered washed away, Kn ight insists the word is not a misspelling of Jews, as everyone else believed. The word, says Knight, comes out of Ma sonic lore. It stands for Ju bela, J u belo, and Ju belum, three apprentice masons who were supposed to have murdered the Grand Master Hiram Abiff, the mason in charge of building Solomon's Temple. In Masonic myth the three were tracked down, killed, and mutilated by other Masons as a warning to those who would betray th e secret brotherhood. The mutilat ions, says Knight, were similar to those carried out on the Ripper's victims. A complicated theory of this kind often has a weak link. In this case the weak link turned out to be Joseph Sickert, the man who had started the whole thing. In June 1978, two years after Knight's book was publ ished, and endorsed by Sickert, the old man gave an interview to the London Sunday Times in which he said: \"It was a hoax, I made it all up . . . a whopping fib.\" Sickert stuck to the story about his parent age, but the Ripper story he said was pure fantasy. \"As an artist I found it easy to p aint Jack the Ripper into the story.\" 3 Knight, however, refused to back down. He shot back saying th at Sickert was incensed because during his researches he had discovered that the third man in the murder ous trio was not Sir Robert Anderson but Walter Sickert. Far from being a protector of some of those threatened by the Masonic killers, Joseph's father was one of the killers himself. Both Stephen Knight and Joseph Sickert are now dead, and th e controversy between them will never be resolved, but the unsupported and wildly unlikely theory of a Masonic conspi racy lives on. New books about the case, and they appear regularly, almost alwa ys contain a serious discussion of the theory. Knight 's own book is still availabl e, as is a video based on the book. And if you want to see the case solved, find a copy of the 1979 film Murder by Decree . It is quite a gripping film in which Sherlock Holmes uncovers the terrible Masonic conspiracy behind the Jack the Ripper murders. It's all fiction, of course, as it should be. "},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":" 5 The Conspiracy King In the world of conspiracy theorists there is no one quite like Lyndon LaRouche. It's not th at he holds the most bizarre theories—though he does believe that Queen Elizabeth of England is head of the international drug trade—for others have p romoted even stranger ideas. It is that LaRouche has turned conspiracy theory into a cult and a business. Lyndon LaRouche is truly the Conspiracy King of the world today. With his large bald head and thick rimle ss glasses, LaRouche looks more like a re tired insurance salesman than a wild-eyed fanatic. His paid televised poli tical speeches are delivered in such a flat and boring style that a casual viewer could easily miss the absolutely nutty things he says. LaRouche's odyssey in the world of conspiracy has been a strange one. He cam e from a Quaker background, and his pacifism led him to become an army medic rather than an active soldier during World War II. After the war he drifted into a variety of left-wing groups. For a time he took the name ''Lyn Marcus,\" after Lenin and Marx. During the upheavals of the 1960s he formed his own group, called the New York Labor Committee. But LaRouche's left-wing associates bega n to view him with increasing suspicion. He formed a new group called the National Caucus of Labor Committees, a nd declared war on his enemies, real and imagined. Some of his followers began beating up members of other left-wing groups. The follow ers were often arrested for assault, whil e LaRouche himself remained safely in the background and out of jail. By the mid-1970s, LaRouche proclaimed that the CIA, along with the Soviet KGB, British Inte lligence, the New York City p olice department, and the Rockefeller famil y, were out to assassinate him. They were going to kidnap some of his followers, b rainwash them, and turn them into robotlike assassins who would be triggered by code words to kill him. The outside world got a glimpse into the paranoid and violent world of Lyndon LaRouche in January 1974, when a young woman named Alice Weitzman sailed a paper airplane out of the window of her New York City apartment. The plane landed at the feet of a mother and child out for a walk. When the woman unfolded th e paper she found it contained a desperate note. Alice Weitzman said she was being held prisoner in her apartment, and that her captors were about to move her to some other secret location. When the mother looked up she saw the young woma n waving frantically from her window. She decided it was no joke and contacted the police. Forty minu tes later, when the police a rrived at the apartment, they found that the note indee d was no joke. Weitzman had been a member of LaRouche's group, but she had be gun to express some skepticism . It was then that the group decided that she had been programmed to kill. She wasn't the first. The group had al ready tried to \"deprogram\" several other members. One of them was sent to the hospital when he was found running through the stre ets screaming, \"Decontrol me! Decontrol me!\" When New York Times reporter Paul L. Montgomery inte rviewed members of the group, he f ound that they \"seem incapable of talking about anything but the conspiracy . . . there seems to be anxious expectat ion about who will be singled out as a b rainwashing victim. Mr. Marcus [LaRouche] has told them they are not respons ible for their thoughts or actions because of the 'programming.'\" By the early 1970s, LaRouche's view of hi s own mission had become quite grandiose. \"T he human race is at stake. Either we win or there is no humanity. That's the way she's cut.\" By the mid-1970s, LaRouche had moved from far-left politics to the other end of the po litical spectrum. He insisted that his earlier alliances with the left had only been \"tactical.\" He form ed a close alliance with the Ku Klux Klan and the far-right Liberty Lobby. And he sent his follower s to receive militia-like training at a far-right enclave in Georgia. His conspiracy theories took on a familiar far-right anti-Semitic tone. He announced that Zionism was an evil cult, that a cab al of Jews controlled organized crime, that the Holocaust was mythical, and that the Je wish organization B'na i B'rith \"resurrects the tradition of the Jews who demande d the crucifixion of Jesus Christ.\" 1 "},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":" LaRouche has an even more overarching conspiracy theory. He se es all history as a conflict be tween an evil \"oligarchy\" and what he has called the force of \"neo-Pla tonic humanism,\" whose leaders have include d Alexander the Great, Charlemagne, and more recently Lyndon LaRouche. The \"oli garchy,\" which includes everything that LaRouche does not like, has committed every imaginable crime. There is a generous helping of genuine ne o-Nazi racism in LaRouche's theories. He says his foll owers are a sort of superrace of \"golden souls,\" while the enemy, the \"Zi onist-British organism which must be dest royed so that humanity might live,\" is really a separate biol ogical species. He wants to see a dictatorship establ ished in the United States and a \"total mobilization \" in p reparation for the \"total war\" that is sure to come. But for sheer outrageous goofiness, it is statements like this that have gotten LaRouche the mo st notoriety: \"The entire world' s drug traffic has been run by a single family since its incepti on.\" Since the statement is take n from a LaRouche publication entitled [i]Dope Inc.: Britain's Opium War Agai nst the U.S., it will come as no surprise to find that he is talking about the British royal family as head of the dope trade. The royal family can't do it alone, of cour se. They are aided by a vast collection of secret societies, private policy groups, and intelligence agencies. All the usual suspects are named. But there are also some unusual agents of the conspiracy as well. For example, LaRouche has named the rock gr oup The Grateful Dead as a \"British inte lligence operation.\" It was spawned from the CIA's experiments with psycho-active dr ugs like LSD at Stanford University and similar far-out Bay Ar ea institutions of higher education. \"That was an Allen Dulles [a former CIA dire ctor] period operation which was r un together with the Occult Bureau types in British intelligence, such as Aldous Huxley [a British author who experime nted with drugs].\" LaRouche continues: \"This is part of this satanism busine ss. Call it counterculture. Call it th e Dionysus model of the counterculture. \"Rock is essentially a revival of the an cient Dionysiac, Bacchic ritual . It does have a relationship to the alpha rhythms in t he b rain. If combined with a little alcohol and more, shall we say, mood-shaping substances with youth, with funny sex, this does p roduce a personality change of the counter cultural type.\" 2 The notion that the \"sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll\" countercult ure of the 1960s was brought about by some sort of conspiracy di d not originate with LaRouche; that it is all the fault of the British royal family probably did. More recently LaRouche has suggested that the British government was so mehow behind the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing. In addition to being a dedicated conspir acy theorist, LaRouche is also a dedicated conspirato r. There are a variety of LaRouche-sponsored organizations and publications that do not openly disclose their sponsorship. LaR ouche followers have attempted to infiltrate and control othe r organizations—without a great deal of success— and LaRouche followers have often tried to run for public office, again without maki ng their affiliations and their agenda public. In 1986 a couple of LaRouche followers act ually won in Illinois Democra tic primaries for lieutenant governor and secretary o f state. The reason they won is that they we re attractive and articulate individuals, a nd they never told the voters what they re ally b elieved and who had sponsored th eir campaigns. Since the Democrats were given no chance to win the general election, little attention was paid to the primary electi on and people voted for the LaRouche foll owers assuming that they were regular Democrats. This victory, however, was a mixed blessing for LaR ouche. Once it was discovered, the national press "},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":" On April 9, 1986, Lyndon LaRouche addressed the National Press Club, and this photograph was taken. While he had been toning down his message in previous pub lic speeches, at this session he characterized his political enemie s as drug pushers, homosexuals, pro-Soviet, or insane. suddenly began to examine what the man act ually stood for. Lyndon LaRouche, who had up to that time been little more than an eccentric fringe figure, suddenly be gan to look a lot more menacing. In his regular runs for president, usually in Democratic part y primaries, LaRouche tries to hide his more odious ideas behind code words. For example, in a 1984 prime-time paid political broadcast on CBS, LaRouche did not engage in his usual anti- Semitic diatribes. He just spoke of the influence of \"Kissinger and his friends.\" Fo rmer Secretary of St ate Henry Kissinger is Jewish. The reference might have slipped pa st a casual listener, but it was not lost on the leader of the Michigan Ku Klux Klan—who saluted LaRouche for \"exposing th e neo-atheist materialism of Kissinge r to the dismay of the Talmudists.\" 3 Lyndon LaRouche does not really respond to questions or criticism. Anyone who does criticize him is imm ediately attacked as a part of the conspiracy against him. For example, at a rare news conference in 1992 when a reporter asked him a question he didn't like LaRouche shot back, \"I'm not going to talk to a dope pusher, like you.\" 4 That reaction is typical. LaRouche has a devoted, even fanatical fo llowing, but not a large one. There are pr obably not more than a few hundred or so hard-core LaRouchies. Yet he lives in a luxurious and well-guarded estate in Leesburg, Virginia, and his network of organizations seems very well funded. Where does the money come from? Some of it comes from wealthy supporters. His b iggest catch to date is Louis Du Pont, a member of one of the richest families in America. In a well-public ized case, Du Pont's p arents went into court to prevent Louis from giving everything he had to LaRouche . LaRouche supporters have also sold p ublications, often with innocuous and misleading ti tles, in airports and other public places. But still, that didn't seem to account for the millions of dollars that the LaRouche orga nization raised. When the U.S. government looked into his finances, it was found that he had fraudulently solicited loans from his supporters, mainly elderly women, and never p aid them back. LaRouche was tried, convicted of fraud and tax evasion in 1989, and sentenced to fifteen"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"years in a federal penitentiary. He said th at this was all part of the conspiracy ag ainst him, and predicted that he would be assassinated in prison. Instead he was paroled in 1994. He wa lked out of prison uninjured a nd unrepentant, went back to Leesburg, began grinding out c onspiracy theories once again, and filed as a candidate for the Democratic nomination for p resident in 1996. LaRouche presents no particular danger to society. Though he has been around for decades, he has ne ver been able to attract more than a small following, and advancing age will not impr ove his appeal. His theories, awful as they may be, are not original. Most would exist with or without him. The real danger of Lyndon LaRouche is that he is probably the most active and effective publicist for conspiracy theories in the world today. LaRouche controls a variet y of publications and has organizations in several different countries. He also has a dedicated staff of \"investigator s\" and \"researchers.\" These are individuals who collect clippings and rumors about anyone that Lyndon LaRouche doesn't like. Th at's practically everyone. LaRouche is not particularly effective in spreading his grand theories. Besides, he is now so well known and notorious that no one with a shred of respectability wants to be associated with him in any way. La Rouche has been more effective working on smaller issues and working behind the scen es. It has often been charged that the La Rouche organizations have been used and even paid to dig up dirt and spread false rumors for others. An example of this sort of activity surf aced in 1995. The U.S. Senate appeared poised to ratify an international treaty to p reserve the Earth's biological resources. It had broad bipart isan support. But suddenly and unexpectedly problems arose. Senator Robert Dole called for a pos tponement of the vote, and ultima tely the vote was never held. Where did the opposition come from ? Much of it crystallized around the idea th at \"biodiversity\" was a new religion and the treaty was a threat to U.S. sovereignty, private property rights, control of natural resources, and individual freedom. And tha t theory came from an article wr itten by a LaRouche associate a nd first published in a LaRouche magazine. The article was then widely distributed by a number of complete ly respectable organizations like the Am erican Sheep Industry Association, which had opposed the treaty from the start but claimed that they had no idea of the origins of the alarmist information they were faxing to their senators. The October 17, 1996, issue of The Washi ngton Post quotes Columbia professo r Manning Marable regarding a \"budding alliance\" between LaRouche and Louis Farr akhan, Nation of Islam leader and sponsor of the Million Man March in 1995. Said the Post, \"The LaRouche organizati on, which frequently advances global conspira cy theories, has worked with the Nation of Islam in the past. But since the march, that connection has grown tighter with former LaR ouche vice presidential candidate and civil rights activist Ja mes Bevel frequently appear ing with Farrakhan.\" Lyndon LaRouche has been around a long time. He has dabbled in practically every bran ch of conspiracy theory. Many of his followers and former associates have gone on to their own careers in the small a nd murky world of conspiracy theory. His numerous publications have been used as sources for other conspiracy theorists. Lyndon LaRouche is truly the Conspiracy King. "},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":" 6 ''A Conspiracy So Immense\" For nearly half of the twentieth century a significant percentage of the American publ ic believed that th e United States was not merely threatened by the worldwide Co mmunist conspiracy but actu ally controlled by it. This was the largest, most influential, and most pervasive conspiracy theory in modern American history. Since the Bolshevik revolution in Russia in 1917, most Amer icans feared and hated communism. There was also a much smaller but not insignificant number of Am ericans who were sincerely attracted to the Communist ideology. Of these, some b ecame genuine Soviet agents and spies. Bu t to put matters in perspective, the Unit ed States had its own agents and spies within the Soviet Union. And the United States was never in any serious dange r of being taken over by the communist conspiracy. However, you could never convinc e Joe McCarthy's followers of that. To h ear them tell it, the Reds had already taken over, and only one man could save them. For a few years in the early 1950s, Joseph R. McCarthy, junior se nator from Wisconsin, was, if not the most powerful man in America, certainly one of the most feare d. McCarthy had been elected to the Senate in 1946, but he didn't make much of an impact in Washington until he disc overed the Communist conspiracy. Most of McCarthy's biographers say that he didn't believe much of what he said, at least not at first. But he said it anyway b ecause it got attention. McCarthy wasn't the first politician to raise the specter of the Red Menace, and he wouldn't be the la st. But no one was ever louder, more extreme, and for a short time more effective. McCarthy began his crusade against the Communist conspiracy with a speech in Wheeling, West Virginia, on February 9, 1950. He horrified his audience with the accusation that the St ate Department was \"thoroughly in fested with Communists.\" He said that he had a list with the names of 205 State Department Communists on it. In la ter speeches he used other numbers, but that didn't make any difference. The figures were completely imaginary. What made the difference was that McCarthy spoke with such assurance and was so specific a bout the conspiracy th at the press began to pay attention to what he was saying. Very quickly this once-obscure senator wi th poor reelection prospects became a na tional celebrity. Th e press would report every charge he made no matter how outrageous they knew it to be. Right-wing groups that already believed the country was in the grip of the Communist conspiracy had found their cham pion. The money poured in. A lot of politicians who knew that McCarthy was talking nonsense and genuinely disliked his tactics began backing him b ecause they were afraid of angering his devoted followers. The more attention and support he got, th e wilder and more extreme became the ch arges he made. He could destroy careers and entire branches of government with a single speech. A high point, or perhaps a low point, in his \"anti-Communist crusade,\" and certainly a low point in Am erican history, came in mid-June 1951 when McCarthy went to the floor of the U.S. Senate and delivered a two-hour-a nd-forty-five minute harangue that was part of a 169-page attack. The most memorable part of the speech was where he attacked a \"mys terious, powerful\" figure who was part of ''a conspiracy on a scale so immense as to dwarf any previous such vent ure in the history of man. A cons piracy of infamy so black that , when it is finally exposed, its p rincipals shall be forever deserving of the maledictions of all honest men.\" 1 This \"mysterious, powerful\" figure was none other than the former secretary of defens e, General George C. Marshall, a World War II hero, architect of the Ma rshall Plan (which many historians credit w ith saving Western Europe from communism after the war), and one of the most respected men in America. Marshall ha d his enemies and detractors, as everyone in public life does, but for McCarthy to stand on the floor of the Senate and charge that he was at the center of an immense Communist conspiracy was absolutely stunning. And Mc Carthy got away with it. Yes, he was denounced as \"setting a new high for irresponsibility\" and even as being \"of unsound mind.\" But his millions of follow ers loved it. This is wh at they had believed a ll along, and now someone in the public spotlight was saying it fo r them. And many of those who didn't agree with everything McCarthy said assumed that there must be so me truth in it. The notion that \"where ther e is smoke there must be fire\" is deeply embedded in our consciousness. If McCarthy had been a clever politician, there is no telling how far he might have gone. But he wasn't very clever, and he alienated too many people, including the newly elected and imm ensely popular new president, General Dwight Eisenhower. Eisenhower had alwa y s hated McCarth y for attackin g his old friend and former commandin g officer General Marshall. Then"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"McCarthy overreached hims elf by directly attacking the U. S. Army. The result was a long televised hearing of McCarthy's charges in 1954. It was the first major live television coverage of a political event. McCarthy, who was generally unkempt and untelegenic, looked and sounded downright thuggish dur ing the hearings, and wh ile no conclusion was On March 16, 1955, when this photograph was taken, Joseph McCarthy was still a senator but losing favor with his colleagues and the American public. For years he had exercised great power and in fluence by charging that many of the most prominent and respected people in Americ a were either dupes or agents of a vast Communist conspiracy. reached the junior senator from Wisconsin was clearly the loser in the court of public opinion. By the end of the year he was censured by an overwhelming majority of his Senate colleague s. He became the only senator in Washington who was never invited to the White House. Yet—and this is important—in sp ite of all the disapproval, and in spite of the many times that McCart hy's conspiracy charges had been demonstrated to be absolutely false, he never lost hi s core following. Polls showed that even after the censure by the Senate, fully one third of the American public still believed th at McCarthy was right and thought he was a courageous hero for exposing the Communist conspiracy. McCarthy did not create this group, and it did not di sappear with his fall from political grace. McCarthy was never able to do anything wi th his still immense popular following beca use he lacked the skill and perhaps the ambition to lead an independent politic al movement, and because he was a chro nic alcoholic whose drinking had begun to spiral completely out of control. He died on May 2, 1957, from the effects of his dri nking. By the end of hi s life he apparentl y had begun to believe many of the conspiracy stories that he had previously told. He repeatedly told friends, \"They're killing me.\" 2 After his death some McCarthy partisans claimed that he had never been a hea vy drinker and that his death had been due to infectious hepatitis or something el se unconnected wi th alcoholism. The most extreme of the McCarthyites found a more sinister explanation for hi s death. William Loeb, editor of the ultraconservative but very influential Manchester Union Leader of New Hampshire , wrote shortly after his hero's death: MCCARTHY WAS MURDERED BY THE COMMUNISTS BE CAUSE HE WAS EXPOSING THEM.

One dedicated McCa rthyite insisted that the great man ha d been murdered not by the Communists b ut by the Illuminati! In the minds and imaginations of the conspiracy theorist s the Communists not only were going to take over our government, b ut our bodies as well. One of the more bizarre episodes of the Cold War era was the controversy over fluoridating the water supply to prevent tooth decay. Putting fluorine, a pale yellow relative of chlorine gas, into the water supply wa s first tested in the 1940s. The tests showed quite conclusively that fluoridated water did help to prevent tooth decay in children. But some people complained that the fluorine also produced other effects, such as dizziness, nausea, and headaches. No scie ntific evidence of harmful side effects was ever found, but public-health controversie s of this type are fairly common. Usuall y they are resolved quietly. Not so with fluoridation. Very quickly a large moveme nt sprang up, claiming that the entire population was being force-fed a deadly p oison. In high concentrations fluorine is a deadly poison. But so is chlorine. Many who opposed fluoridation were motivated by a vague fear that their freedom was bei ng eroded when the government introduced a chemical into their water suppl y. It was seen as a threat to their pers onal liberty; it was un-American. However, similar fears had not been expressed over the much more widespread use of chlorine to kill harmful bacteria in the water supply. To others fluoridation was a kind of \"mass medication,\" a way of dosing the multitudes th at might be the precursor of socialized medicine and a symptom of the loom ing Communist takeover. To many, fluoridation was nothing less than an integral part of the Communist conspiracy, a \"method of Red warfare\"—a plot to drug Americans into submission. A spea ker at an American Legion convention in New York claimed fluoridation was a \"secret Russian revolutionary technique to deaden our minds, slow our reflexes, and gradually kill our will to resist aggression.\" According to the [i]Americanis m Bulletin, fluoridation had been used by Germany's Weimar regime (the left- wing German government that fell to Hitler) and had also been used by the Russians to obtain phony confessions from p risoners. Fluoridation, the [i]Bul letin went on, was \"more danger ous than atomic bombs.\" Today most of the country's major water supplies are fluoridat ed. Because of that, you probably have fewer cavities, and in case you didn't notice, the Communists have not taken over—yet. "},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":" 7 The New World Order The collapse of Soviet communism in the 1990s left many in America feeling abandoned and adrift. It wasn't just the former Communists who felt that way either. Many of those on the far right, the most fanatical of the anti-Communists, suddenly found themselves without a focu s for their fears or an anchor for their anger. For decades they had been able to blame practically ever ything that went wrong in the world or in their lives on the international Communist conspiracy. Suddenly the Russian Comm unists were no more, and even the most fanatical persons could not convince themselves, or anyone el se, that the Communist collapse was just another clever Commie ploy to confuse the true patriots and weaken their resolv e, while secretly underground the Communists were still th ere, re powerful and more sinister than ever. Somehow the Communists in China, the mo st populous nation on Earth, just couldn't take the place of the old Soviet Communists. There was no denying it, no escaping it , the Communist conspiracy, which seemed to explain so much, was dead and gone. But in a very real and personal way, li ttle had actually changed in America. Those who had bl amed the Communists were no richer or more powerful than before. Taxes were still high. The government was still trying to take away their guns. The rampant immorality that they had seen as being promoted by the Communist conspira cy was, if anything, more rampant than ever. Something was still wrong. To some very nearly everything was st ill wrong. A conspiracy to de prive them of what they needed and wanted was still out there. But what was it? It was President George Bush who inadvert ently give this conspiracy its new name. Shortly after th e victory over Iraq in the Persian Gulf War, President Bush said, \"I hope that history will record that the Gulf Crisis was the crucible for a new world order.\" The New World Order (or NWO) has become sort of a catch-all phrase. It means that some sort of one-world government or international control is to be forced on the United States, destroying the nation's sovereignt y and the constitutional freedoms of its citizens. Those behind the conspi racy are a shadowy but immensely pow erful group that might be called the \"Establishment\" or the \"Elite.\" Whoever they are they do not represent the ordinary folk wh o should be represented in a democracy like America. In this belief or fear both right- and left-wing conspiracy theorists often agree. Sometimes it is difficult to tell the difference between th em, and sometimes there is no difference. George Bush himself was just the sort of man to set the cons piracy theorists' bells ringing. He was a wealthy member of the Eastern political establishment, the ultima te Washington insider. Never mind that he had moved to Texas and had attempted to p ortray himself as the quintesse ntial Texan. That pose fooled no one. While at Ya le, George Bush had even been a member of the secret Skull and Bones Society. This Ya le student group is secretive and may be bo th snobbish and silly, but it is hardly sinister. To some conspiracy theorists, however, the Skull and Bones is right up there with the Freemasons and the Illuminati. Bush had been a member of several highly suspect internati onalist organizations like the C ouncil on Foreign Relations (CFR) and the Trilateral Commission (Trilat). He had even been a CFR board director. An d, most damning of all, he had been director of the Central Intelli gence Agency, every conspirato logist's favorite bogeyman. In their book, 50 Greatest Conspiracies of All Time , authors Jonathan Vankin and John Whalen describe the New World Order this way: \"The champions of the NWO are indeed a cadre of powerful industrialists, bankers , academics and politic ians who for three quarters of a century have been a gray eminence behind the govern ance of Britain and America. Mo re to the point perhaps they are the governors of the Western world. Call them what you will they are the 'Establishment.' Through vastly influential organizations like the Council on Foreign Relations and the Trilateral Commission, th ese elites formulate tomorrow's public p olicy today and staff the ship of state with their own. ''If this network is something less than the Red Devil depicted in many a right wing conspiracy theory, it is none the less th e kind of big business cabal that helps the elite of the private s ector if not 'rule the world' th en at least run it like a busin ess.\" 1 The most influential and res p ectable p romoter of NWO cons p irac y theor y was the late Professor Carroll Qui g le y , a scholar"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"from Georgetown University. In his massive book [i]Tragedy and Hope, he wrote that there \"does exist, and has existed for a generation, an international Anglophile [pro-B ritish] network which operates, to some extent, in the way that the radical Right b elieves the Communists act.\" 2 Quigley said that he had been close to this cabal of intern ational manipulators, and that he even admired their goals—and had b een allowed to examine \"papers and secret records.\" Quigley saw the international conspiracy as a relatively bene volent one whose goal is \"nothing less than to create a world system of financial control in private hands able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole.\" The result would be peace and prosperity, and of course great profit to th ose who pulled the strings. Quigley represents a moderate, or centri st, conspiratorial view. The far right ha s adopted a much more menacing view. The John Birch Society, which during the 1960s and 1970s was consider ed the ultimate far-right c onspiracy group in the United States, even thought that the internationali st elite controlled the Soviet Communists, and the Birchers hated the Communists. In the official John Birch Society ideology it was the internationalist capitalists who actua lly financed the Bolshevik revolut ion in Russia in 1917. A popular John Birch Society book of the 1970s was Gary Allen's None Dare Call It Conspiracy . This was the sequel to the all-time Birch So ciety best-seller None Dare Call It Treason , which detailed the society's vi ew of the Communist menace in America. In Allen's opinion the first move that th is internationalist elite ma de to control America and s ubvert the Constitution was to establish a central bank, the Federal Rese rve System. Then came the income tax, and taking America off the gold standard. The 1929 stock market crash and th e Great Depression that followed were \"scientif ically engineered\" by the Establishment. So were the two world wars a nd the Vietnam War. The cons pirators did very well for themselves by selling arms to both sides. Of course, the most fiendish creation was the United Nations—the hated \"one world government\" th at will destroy America. Right-wing conspiracy theorists have spen t many hours compiling lists of powerful Am erican political figures who are also members of the Council on Foreign Relations, the Trilateral Commission, or any of the othe r international establishment organizations. In President Clinton's admini stration, for example, the se cretary of state, all five of his undersecretaries, an d many of their subordinates as well as the national security advi sor and head of the CIA were all members of the CFR. Some conspiracy theorists with anti-Semitic leanings see an ever-threatening cabal of \"inter national Jewish bankers\" behind it all. Others look to the Illuminati, the Freemasons, or some even more esoteric, obscure, and probably quite imaginary secret society as the hidden hand controlling events. While manipulation of the Federal Reserve sy stem may be of compelling interest to so me conspiracy theorists, it is not the sort of belief that gets most people exci ted. In truth, most people have absolutely no idea what the Federal Reserve system is and they don't really care very much. Invoki ng the Council on Foreign Relations and the Trilateral Commission is not going to create a great deal of excitement eith er. But fear of a New World Order does i nvolve far more emotional issues—what the p oliticians call \"red meat\" issues.

These ships have been called Fl ying Saucers, Unidentified Flyi ng Objects, or most commonly b y the abbreviation UFOs (pronounced U-FOHZ by insiders). In addition many people believe rumo rs that the government has known about these visits for more than ha lf a century, and, for some reason, has b een covering up this knowledge. In short, there has been a vast and sinister conspiracy of silence about an invasion from outer space! This is not the sort of conspiracy theory that generally se nds people running to the hills with their guns or even causes them to change the way they vote. On occasion, how ever, the belief can become dangerously obsessive. In June 1996, members of a UFO group on Long Island, New York, were indicted for plotti ng to poison county officials wi th radioactive materials. According to the indictme nts the men believed that a UFO had crashed on Long Island and that county of ficials were trying to cover this up. The leader of the group also appeared to believe that government agen ts, including the local police, were plotti ng to kill him. The firm conviction that there is some sort of a UFO conspiracy pops up regular ly in books, on television and radio talk shows, and in films like the incredibly popular [i]Independence Day (1996), which b ecame one of the biggest moneymakers in Hollywood history. Many reasons have been given for the success of this film. One certainly is that many in the audience are thinking, \"Well, it might be true .\" Belief in UFOs is part of our culture, part of our mental landscape. We can hardly imagine a time when we didn't believe in UFOs. I know how it all began because I was an eyewitness and in a small way even a particip ant in the beginnings of the extraterrestrial cons piracy belief. For many years there had been reports off and on of strange obj ects sighted in the sky. But what came to be regarded as the age of flying saucers began on June 24, 194 7. On that day a man named Kenneth Arnol d, a private pilot, was flying near the Cascade Mountains in the state of Washingt on when he sighted nine objects streaki ng through the sky towa rd Mount Rainier. The lead object looked like a dark crescent; the other eight were flat and disc-shape d. They disappeared from view after about two and a half minutes. On the following day Arnold told his story to a couple of local reporters. One of them put it on the Associated Press wire, an d it was picked up widely. The Arnold sighti ng stimulated other sighting stories. In general, however, the Arnold sighting was regarded as what journalists call a \"silly season\" item, a ma rginally newsworthy story that was printed during the summer months when there was relatively li ttle \"hard,\" or important, news. In the late 1940s there was also a pervasive atmosphere of susp icion and fear. The United States had emerged victorious from World War II. Almost immediately it was plunged into the Cold War, that long period of confr ontation with the Soviets. The United States had already developed an atomic bomb, and everyone knew it was only a ma tter of time before the Soviet Union had its own atomic bomb. The fear was that the next war would be even more terrible than the last, that the human race might actually annihilate itself. This atmosphere affected the way people began to think about UFOs in several wa ys. The U.S. government and particularly the military began to wonder if the strange things that peopl e reported seeing might not be so me sort of Soviet \"secret weapon.\" Some of the things that people repor ted were actually secret U.S. military pr ojects, and these were to be kept secret. Much of the general public thought or at l east hoped that the spaceships had come to he lp save the human race from itself. That was a popular theme in a lot of science fiction. Flying saucers also had an active and effective promoter. He was Ray Palmer, editor of the pulp science-fiction magazines A mazing Stories and Fantastic Adventures . The covers of these magazines regularly featured semiclad gi rls being menaced by a BEM (Bug Eyed Monster). Though th ese were clearly lurid fiction magazines, th e eccentric Palmer ofte n ran long editorials p romoting any number of truly bizar re theories or beliefs. While much of the p ress first re g arded fl y in g saucers as a sort of j oke, Palmer took u p the cause in his editorial columns. But"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"the publishers got tired of Palmer's increa sing use of the magazines as his personal soapbox. He quit or wa s fired over plans f or an all-UFO issue. In the spring of 1948, Palmer began a new magazine, FATE , devoted to \"true\" ta les of the strange and unknown. The cover story for the first issu e was \"The Truth About Flying Saucer s\" by Kenneth Arnold. Palmer himself p robably wrote the articl e and a later Arnold book, The Coming of the Saucers . Palmer's breathless style was unmistakable. Later, Ray Palmer edited a number of ot her flying-saucer magazines. He never beca me rich as a few UFO promoters have, but he stuck with the subject. Year in and year out, even at times wh en interest in UFOs seemed to have faded entirely, Palmer was still out there promoting. Astronomer Donald Menzel, an early critic of UFO theories, said that Palmer practically created flying saucers. That is an exaggeration, but he ce rtainly helped to keep the interest alive. Ray Palmer died in 1977. Right up to th e end even his friends were not sure whet her he believed anything he wrote. In the late 1940s I was a young teen living in Chicago (where Pa lmer's magazines were first pub lished), and I was a devotee o f science fiction and ''true mysteries.\" I wa s therefore an avid reader of Palmer's publications. Over the years I became disillusioned when the flying saucers I sinc erely believed were going to land in some public place for all to see failed to do so. Still, I can vividly remember the treme ndous feeling of exhilaration of those early days. There was a small band of us who b elieved—no, we KNEW—an astonishing truth that the rest of the world was too blind to see. It made us fe el very special, and it was a faith that was painful to give up. From personal experi ence I can say that the attraction of bizarre, even completely crazy, theories can be astonishingly power ful. I am never tempted to ask, \"How can a sane person believe such nonsense?\" I did and I like to think that I'm sane. If an ordinary teen living in Chicago could know the truth about UFOs , then certainly the government with all its ability to monitor the skies should know it too. The only logical conclusi on one could draw was that th e government did know the truth b ut was covering it up. And in fact, the gove rnment was covering things up, but they we re not the truths that I and my fellow flying-saucer buffs had imagined. Once again the era of the Cold War must be kept in mind. Whil e a few in the government and mi litary were intrigued by the extraterrestrial possibilities of UFOs, th at idea was not take n seriously for very long. What the U.S. government was really concerned about was that the Soviets might be developing some sort of \"secret weapon ,\" an aircraft or missile, and this was what people were seeing. A special panel wa s set up by the CIA to look into the possibi lity. The Soviet hypothesis was quickly discarded for total lack of evidence. However, the U.S. government itself was conducting some experiments that were mistaken for UFO sightings, and that was being covered up. The Roswell incident, now far and away th e most famous UFO event, is a case in point. In early July 1947, just a couple of weeks after the Arnold sight ing, something crashed in a field of a remote ra nch near Roswell, New Mexico. The owner of the ranch, William \"Mac\" Brazel, went into town a few days later and reported this to the local sheriff. The sheriff called nearby Roswell Air Base, and the Air Force sent ou t a team of officers to investigate. The Air Force investigators picked up some of the debris from the ranch. It consiste d mostly of highly flexible metallic-like fragments and pieces of a light but st iff material that appeared to be c overed with strange writing or figures. "},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":" This photograph, dated July 8, 1947, shows Brigadier General Roge r Ramey studying the remains of wh at the Air Force said in a p ress release was a \"device used by air force and weather bureau(s ) to determine wind velocity and directio n\" that had fallen near Roswell, New Mex ico, a few days earlier. On July 8 the public-relations officer at Roswell Army Air Base issued a press release stating th at a \"flying disc\" had finally b een found and that the debris was being sent to Fort Worth for examination. That st ory was a sensation, but a short-lived one. Within hours, in a news conference at Fort Worth, Army spokesm en dismissed the whole incident , saying what had fallen to Earth on the Brazel ranch were the remain s of an ordinary weather balloon that ha d been destroyed in a thunderstorm. Most people, including most UFO buffs, accepted the explana tion. While interest in UFOs grew during the 1950s and 1960s, the Roswell story was almost entirely forgot ten. It wasn't until the late 1980s that UFO enthusiasts rediscovered Roswell with a vengeance and began to reexamine the case. Rancher Brazel was long dead, but others who were on the scen e at the time or who now claime d that they had been on the scene, began telling their stories. Some of the stories indicated that the whole weather-balloon story wa s fraudulent and the government knew it. They said that Brazel and others actually had been told to keep quiet about wh at they had found or seen. \"In 1947 when the government told you to s hut up, you shut up,\" one witness recalled. 1 The stories got wilder—much w ilder. There were rumors of a much larger cr ash near Roswell and of the bodies of several space aliens found on the scene and hidden away by a fearful U.S. governme nt. It was usually suggested that they were hidden at Wright-Patterson Air Force Ba se outside of Dayton, Ohio. The story kept gaining momentum. There were several books on Roswell. It was th e subject of a very popular made-for-TV movie. There was even what purported to be a film of an \"alien autopsy.\" The film was an obvious phony. At least it was obvious to many of us. But it was so widely watched that the Fox TV network gave it a repeat showing al most immediately, and copies of the film are still available for sale or rent. There are now two UFO museums in Rosw ell (and not much else since the air ba se closed down). They are places of p ilgrimage for UFO believers and some nonbelievers. Then, in September 1994, the Air Force finally admitted that, ye s, there had been a cover-up at Roswell—sort of a cover-up an y wa y . While what fell to Earth on the Brazel ranch was a ba lloon, it wasn't an ordinar y weather balloon as the Air Force had"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"originally said. The balloon was part of a program called Pr oject Mogul. It was aimed at putting sensors high into the atmosphere in order to detect pos sible Soviet nuclear tests. And in 1947 the project was top secret. People had indeed been told to shut up—not about spaceships but about a top-secret project. \"This w on't lay it to rest,\" sighe d Colonel Albert C. Trakowski, a retired Air Force officer who had run Project Mogul. He was quite right. Said Walter G. Haut, who runs one of the Roswell UFO museums, \"All they'v e done is given us a different kind of balloon. Then it was weather, and now it's Mogul. Basi cally I don't think anything has changed. Excuse my cynicism, b ut let's quit playing games.\" 2 It is difficult to pinpoint just exactly where and when the government cover-up stor ies began. But they certainly started earl y in the flying-saucer era, and they were helped along enorm ously by something that happened about six months after the Kenneth Arnold sighting. This incident al so involved a balloon, a cover-up, and trag ically the death of an airman. On January 7, 1948, Captain Thomas Mant ell was killed when his National Guard F-51 crashed while pursuing what he b elieved was a flying saucer ne ar Fort Knox, Kentucky. Captain Mantell was leading a flight of four F-51s on orders to investigate a UFO sighted over Godman Air Force Base. Mantell radioed, \"I'm closing in on it now to take a good look. It's directly ahead of me and still moving at about half my speed. . . . The thing looks meta llic and of tremendous size.\" 3 A short time later his plane crashed. The official explanation was that Captain Ma ntell had blacked out from lack of oxygen during the chase, which could have easily happened in a plane of that era. Of c ourse, there were rumors that the wreckage of the plane showed that it had been shot full of holes or that the area of the crash ha d been found to be intensely radioactive. There were, however, no facts to back up such rumors. But a vital question remained—what was Ca ptain Mantell chasing? The initial Air Fo rce explanation was that he was chasing the planet Venus. That is not as silly as it sounds. At certain times and under certain atmospheri c conditions Venus can appear to be enormous, and it has fooled even experienced pilots. But at the time of the crash Venus was not in a part of the sky wher e it could possibly have fooled Captain Mantell. The explanati on was quickly ridiculed, and th e Air Force looked foolish or, worse, sinister. It wasn't until 1951 that the Air Force admitted they knew what the pilot had been chasing, and they had known all along. He was chasing a giant Skyhook balloon. But in 1948, Project Skyhook was also top secret. Air Force of ficials deliberately misled investigators and suppressed reports from other observers who had identified the obj ect as a balloon. By the time the Skyhook explanation became known, the damage had been done. Many assumed, quite reasonably, that if the Air Force had lied about an accident that killed one of its own pilo ts, it might still be lying, still covering up something more sensational than a sec ret b alloon project. It was impossible for the U.S. government not to respond to the widespread and gr owing public belief in UFOs and in a government conspiracy. But the response was clumsy and deceptive and simply fa nned the fires of public disbelief and distrust. After the death of Captai n Mantell the Air Force initiated a string of \"projects\" that were os tensibly aimed at investigating and explaining the UFO phenomenon. They had na mes like Project Sign, Project Grudge, and finally Project Blue Book. At the start some of those involved in the Air Force investigations took the extraterrest rial hypothesis seriously indeed. But by the time Project Blue Book, the last and longest lived of the Ai r Force UFO projects, was esta blished, the investigation had b ecome little more than a public-relations ef fort. For most of its twenty-year existe nce, Blue Book didn't have the personnel or the funding to investigate much of anythi ng. The staff, which consisted of a major, two sergeants, and a secretary, could not p ossibly handle the thousands of UFO sight ings that were reported annually. They di dn't even try. UFO buffs denounced Blue Book as a cover-up, and in a sense it was. What the Air Forc e was really covering up, however, was not secret information about space aliens, but the fact that they didn't take the whol e subject seriously and were doi ng as little as possible about i t. Another red flag for believers was the early involvement of the Central Intelligence Agency in UFO investigations. In fact the CIA had been monitoring the phe nomenon since 1949, despite statements to the c ontrary. In January 1953, after a major UFO flap, the CIA convened a scientific panel on UFOs headed by Dr. H. P. Robertson, a well-know n California physicist. The p anel apparently took its job seriously but quickly concluded th at UFOs themselves represente d no national-security threat. However, the Robertson panel reported, the public was deve loping \"a morbid national ps ychology\" that might induce \"h y sterical behavior and harmful distrust of dul y constituted authorit y .\" The p anel concluded that \"immediate ste p s to stri p the"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Unidentified Flying Objects of the special status they have been given,\" should be undertaken. 5 In brief, tell people as little as p ossible and downplay UFOs. In 1953 the CIA was just beginning to acquire its reputation of enormous, almost omnisc ient power, in some eyes attaining the status of an invisible government. When th e report of the Robertson panel was decla ssified with its suggestions that UFOs essentially be buried as far as the public was concerned, it wa s cited as yet another example of the ongoing conspiracy of silence. By 1966 the Air Force was thoroughly sick of its involvement in the UFO controversy. The U.S. government wanted to get out of the UFO business completely. The c hosen method was to convene a committee under the direction of a distinguished scientist who would review what had been learned over the previous twenty years an d issue a definitive report. At first no major scientist or university wanted to touch the study , though there was a sizable fi nancial grant attached. Finally the job was taken on by Dr. Edward U. Condon, a physicist from the University of Colo rado. At first Condon appeared the perfect choice. In the late 1940s and early 1950s he had come under severe attack from the House Un-American Activities Committee and Representative Richard Ni xon, then a young and ambi tious congressman from California who was making a reputation for himself as a fire -breathing anti-Communist. Condon was accused of \"consorting with Communists.\" As a result his security clearance was revoked, but Condon fought back and ultimately was vindicated. So he had a reputation for independence and taking on the government, in addition to being a well-known and well- respected scientist. I attended the press conference at whic h Condon's appointment as head of the study was announced. Condon declared that he was quite neutral on the subject of UFOs. Th is, of course, was untrue. Like most sc ientists Condon thought the extraterrestrial hypothesis was silly at best, though he didn't know much about the subject at the ti me. But he seemed quite serene in his belie f that he would be able to produce a study with such over whelming evidence that the public would be persuaded. I talked to him after the news conference and told him th at unless he produced the little green men from Mars, the UFO b elievers would skin him alive. He t hought I was exaggerating. Several years late r, after controversies left Condon both shocked at the reaction to his work and deeply embittered, he sent me a note saying that during the controversy he had often thought of our brief conversation. I was no seer. I had just been with the UFO world long enough to know how thoroughly the b elief in a government conspiracy had gri pped the believers. For them there was no such thing as honest disagreement. There was only conspiracy and cover-up. Condon's problems started early, particularly after a memorandum from project coordina tor Robert Low, stating that while the committee had virtually no hope of finding a UFO they would have to appear as if they were looking for one, was leaked to the p ress. As attacks from the UFO community increased and becam e ever more virulent, Condon, who had seemed so calm and collected at the initial press conferen ce, became angrier and angrier. His denunc iations of the UFO believers and their supporters became louder and more intemperate. A rumor sw ept the Ufological community th at Condon had gone mad. He was mad all right, but he had not gone mad. The members of the Condon committee exa mined in detail the evidence for most of the well-known UFO cases, and found nothing sensational. While a few sightings could not be adequate ly explained, the committee assu med that this was because of lack of evidence. They found no evidence of alien spaceships. The UFO buffs had discounted th e Condon report even before it was written. When the massive 1,465-page re port was finally issued in January 1969, it may have served the purpose of giving the government an excuse to get out of the UFO business, but it had virtually no effect on public opinion. Those who cared assumed it was just part of the cover- up. It was the same reaction that had greeted the Warren Report about the JFK assassination a few years earlier. Implications of a UFO conspiracy and cover-up often reached well beyond the Air Fo rce, the CIA, and even beyond the planet Earth. One that has been enshrined in public consci ousness is the tale of the ''men in black.\" The beginning of this story is almost ludicrously mundane. In September 1953, Albert K. Bender, head of the grandly named b ut really quite tiny Internati onal Flying Saucer Bureau, annou nced in his publicati on Space Review that the flying saucer \"mystery\" had been solved. \"But any information about th is is being withheld by orders from a higher source.\" 6 Bender concluded his statement with these words: \"We advise thos e engaged in saucer work to pl ease be very cautious.\" He then shut down his organization, stoppe d publishing [i]Space Review, and generall y withdrew from the UFO field. To his friends, Bender confided a few more details. He said that he had been visited by \"three men in dark suits,\" later to be known as \"three men in black,\" and that the y had been \" p rett y rou g h\" with him and essentiall y scared him off."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":" Generally his friends, most of whom were devoted UFO buffs , didn't believe Bender's story. They knew his organization had b een losing money, and they figured that he was just looking for a dramatic excuse for abandoni ng UFOs. But the story of the men in black (MIB) began to take on a life of its own, and s oon others who said they had UFO encounters reported that they too had been visited by the sinister and mysterious MIB. Bender's original account makes the MIB soun d like CIA or other government operatives. But in later accounts they take on a weirder and unworldly aura. They are someti mes said to have \"glowing eyes,\" which ar e hidden by dark glasses. They arrive in large black Cadillacs that have a strange purple glow on the inside, and appear to be able to navigate dark roads without headlights. Or they show up suddenly at remote spots, apparently without the aid of any vehicle at all. Their speech is often strange and robotlike. But their unive rsal aim seems to be to silen ce those who \"know too much.\" Despite the fact that there has never been a single bit of credib le evidence to indicate that the MIBs even exist, much less w hat they are, they have become an integral part of the atmosphere of conspiracy that surrounds the UFO field. Nor do all the conspiracy theories date from the early days of UFOs. In December 1984 a collection of what were supposed to b e government documents surfaced revealing the existence of a super-secret group of scientis ts known as \"Majestic 12\" (MJ- 12) that had been appointed by President Harry Truman to study th e remains of aliens that had been found in a crashed UFO in 1947. The members of the group were all well -known scientists, many of whom had openl y ridiculed the idea of spaceships. They were also all dead. Initially the MJ-12 documents created quite a sensation. But on closer examinat ion most people, including many UFO buffs, concluded that they were fraudulent. But the MJ-12 documents are stil l regularly cited as proof that the government \"knows\" and is \"covering up.\" Like Roswe ll and the MIB, MJ-12 has become enshrined in UFO mythology. A genuinely secret military f acility in Nevada has now become the focus of conspiratorial speculat ion. The place is best known under the name Area 51. For a long time the military even denied that such a place existed at all. But it's there, and it 's well guarded. Just exactly what is going on in Area 51 is unknown, but some of the more informed speculation is that one of the operations is disposal of extremely hazardous waste, whic h would certainly be a good reason for the military to want to keep the place secret. Until fairly recently, Area 51 has had no connection with UFOs. But ther e have been a fairly large number of UFO sightings in the area, and the connection between them and a secret government fa cility has proved irresistible. Somehow the two must be connected, though no one seems to know just how. In 1995, Nevada State Route 375, a 100-mile (160 -kilometer) stretch of secondary road th at runs past Area 51, was officially designated the Extraterrest rial Highway. Nevada state official s cheerfully admit that this is kind of \"a tourist ploy.\" And the tourists do come, and they buy souvenirs at the Little A'Le Inn, a combination gift shop, motel, and restaurant. Some of the more serious UFO buffs decry the commercialism and the frivolity. 7 UFOs, government cove r-ups, MIBs, secret facilities , and all the other conspira torial trappings appear "},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":" The two stars of the enormously popular television show, The X-Files .

"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":" 9 The Final Conspiracy If you dig into practically any conspiracy theory, even the most skeptical person may find hi m or herself seriously wondering if there isn't \"something to it\" after all. Could all the apparent connections just be a series of coincidences? Could so much of the information simply be false? The answer to both questi ons is yes, but that can be a hard answer to accept. A good conspiracy theory sounds reasonable. It appears to answ er a lot of unanswered questions. It can also be exciting, far more interesting than mundane reality. For many, the conspiracy theory merely confirms what they already suspect or believe. And, of course, there is the fact that there have be en conspiracies and cover-ups throughout history. Two widely publicized conspiracy th eories illustrate these points. The first revolves around the deat h of President Bill Clinton's longtime friend a nd personal lawyer Vin cent Foster. Foster had b een a lawyer in Little Rock, Arkansas. He had worked closely with Hillary Clinton in the Rose law firm for nearly fifteen years, and he knew the Clintons well. After Bill Clinton was first elected presid ent, Foster came to Washington to work as a deputy White House counsel and th e Clintons' personal lawyer. Between the time of Clinton' s election and inauguration, Fost er had helped negotiate the end of the Clintons' Whitewater p artnership with Arkansas banke r Jim McDougal. He was also involved with the White House's inept firing of the staff of the travel office. Both Whitewater and what came to be dubbed \"Travelgate\" became major problems for President Clinton, his wife, and his administration. Foster himself became the object of intense scrutiny. Then on the afternoon of July 20, 1993, Vince Foster was found dead in Fort Ma rcy Park, Virginia, just a twenty-minute drive from the White House. Foster had been shot in the head. The fata l pistol was in his hand. His death seemed to be a suicide. Immediately and inevitably, rumors began to spread. One rumor alleged that Foster 's office had been sealed on orders of Hillary Clinton and his files purge d of all incriminating material before invest igators had a chance to look at them. Another, more sensational and persistent rumor was that Foster had not s hot himself in the park, but had been killed elsewhere and his b ody had been transported to the park and arranged so that his de ath would look like a suicide. Here are what people have cited as evidence: \"Foster's whereabouts for a couple of hours before his body wa s discovered are unknown. No one saw or heard Foster shoot himself. No one even saw him enter the park.\" But Fort Marcy Park is an obscure and isolated spot that is often deserted. It is not surprising that he was not seen or heard. \"There was not enough blood at the scene.\" In fact, FB I investigators found a lot of blood at the scene. \"Foster's body was covered with carpet fibers . . . he had been rolled up in a carpet before his body was moved.\" Investigator s concluded that the carpet fibers are unim portant. Carpet fibers are found nearly ev erywhere, and there we re not enough fibers on Foster's body to indicate that he had been encased in a carpet. \"Foster was not suicidal.\" Though Foster had never openly talked about suicide, everyone knew he was a deeply troubled man. Moving from Little Rock to Wash ington apparently put him under pressure s that he was unable to handle. \"Foster didn't leave a suicide note,\" or alternately, \"his su icide note was a forgery.\" There is a common myth that every suicide leaves a note. This is not true. So me suicides leave a note, and some do not. Fo ster left no note. But a few days after his death, tron-up pieces of a note were found in his briefcase. It wasn't really a suicid e note, but a sort of personal defense an d complaint that he had written a little over a week before he died. In it he expresse d his belief that no one in the White House had violated any laws. The last item said, \"I was not meant for the job or spotlight of public life in Washington. Here ruining p eople is considered a sport.\" 1 Some insist that the handwriting on this not e was not Foster's and that the pieces we re planted in his briefcase to bolster th e suicide theory. Foster's wife insists that she knew he had writ ten such a defense, and the handw riting most certainly was that of her husband."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":" While investigators and most of the mainst ream media have concluded that Vincent Fost er did indeed kill himself, the story of a murder conspiracy and cover-up has been kept alive by a sm all group of journalists, most of whom are working for a multimillionaire named Richard Me llon Scaife. Sacife had contributed hundreds of millions of dollars to fund conservative causes. He dislikes Democrats in general and Bill Clinton in pa rticular. He owns a small newspa per that has printed most of the articles questioning the Foster suicide. He also supports the Western Journalism Center, which has produced a video called Unanswered: The Deat h of Vincent Foster . Foster's death is a regular feature of so me radio talk shows, and a Vincent Foster home page is even available on the World Wide Web. The campaign has worked. As this is be ing written, there remain ge nuine unanswered questions about Whitewater, the travel- office firings, and other activities about which Vincent Fost er might have had knowledge. But there should be no question about how Foster died—he committed suicide. Yet polls take n in 1996 indicate that about th ree quarters of the American p ublic are not convinced of this. 2 Most Americans appear to believe that Foster may indeed have been \"the man who knew too much\" and that a conspiracy and cover-up have obscured the facts surrounding his death. An even more insidious conspiracy theory surfaced—or to be more accurate, resurfaced—i n August 1996. A series of articles in the San Jose Mercury News said that the CIA played a ke y role in launching the crack-co caine epidemic. The articles revived an old charge that the agency ai ded cocaine smugglers during the Reagan admini stration's covert war in Nicaragua. The story runs like this: In the early 1980s the Reagan ad ministration had a near obsession with the left-wing Sandinista government of Nicaragua. The CIA, at th e strenuous urging of its director, the la te William J. Case y, was covertly and sometimes illegally supporting the Contras, a collection of rebel groups attempting to overthrow the Sandinistas. Some of the Contras were dealing cocaine in order to get money to support their army. In other cases individuals who were nothing more than drug dealers may have operated under a Contra cover. That much has been fairly well known and accepted for a long time. The question is, how much did the CIA know about the drug deal ing at the time, and did they just look the other way or actually participate in trafficking cocaine? The CIA has always denied such charges, but with a secret agency such denials are routine and just as rout inely disbelieved. The newspaper's articles set off a fire storm in the African-American community. Starting in the early 1980s a devastating epidemic of a cheap, solid form of co caine called crack swept through black nei ghborhoods. The epidemic had been fueled by the availability of massive quantities of relatively inexpensive cocaine from South America. Was it possible that the CIA or some of its operative had actually allo wed the deadly drug to be spread? And there were even more ominous rumors. It was hinted that CIA involvement was not just the result of overzealousness in the cause of the Contras and indifference to the results, but part of a de liberate and genocidal c onspiracy against African Americans. On talk radio and across the Internet th ere was speculation about how the CIA first introduced crack cocaine into black areas and then had its agents spread the deadly drug across the country. It wa s said that this was a plot to subdue and ultimately destroy African Americans. These theories found a receptiv e audience in a community already deeply distrustful of government authority. At the time of this writing, there were a number of ongoing inves tigations of the charges of CIA links to drug deals. So far n o clear evidence of any such links has been found, but it is impo ssible to predict what future investigations might reveal. However, it is also impossible to imagine that evidence to s upport the grander conspiracy, that the CIA deliberately began the crack epidemic, will be ever be found, because it doesn't exist. The reality is that in the early 1980s huge quantities of coca ine were pouring into the country from many sources—most of which have never been linked to the CIA. Even if those drug dealers named in the [i]San Jose Mercury News articles had never existed, the use of crack cocaine would have spread in the same way. There was just too much of it out there already. But none of that makes any difference an ymore. No investigations, no rational disc ussion, will remove the fear and the anger that have developed. People will believe in this conspiracy for the same reasons that people have always believed in conspiracies—they want to, because it seem s to explain the terrible things that ha ve happened. The ideas of conspiracies and cover-ups help people make sense out of events, indeed out of a world, that ofte n seems senseless, indifferent, or cruel. However, conspiracy theories are not a l ook at the real or ''hidden\" history, but a flight from reality. And a theory, no matt er how dee p l y one believes it, will not chan g e that realit y ."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":" The best thing that you can do when confronted with a grand cons piracy theory is to step back and get a little historical p erspective. Try to remember all the other cons piracies you have read about in this book. Have the Communists taken over America? Have the Illuminati? Was John Wilkes Booth found alive? Have flying saucers really landed? Of course not. Yet conspiracy theorists of the past have confidently predicted all these things. Their predictions about what is going to happen in the future are not goi ng to be one bit more accurate. Some conspiracy theorists try to pass the whole business off as sort of a harmless intellectual game. They put out publication s with names like Paranoia . \"We just want people to think,\" says the direct or of the Kennedy assassination museum in Dallas. The authors of a popular conspiracy book call themselves The National Insecurity Council . They tell their readers to find their b ook \"entertaining.\" They add, ''But we also hope you'll take it seriously.\" 3 They warn their readers not to be \"carried away\" and see conspiracies everywhere. \"We don't encourage that.\" \"However,\" they continue \" . . . conspiracies have existed throughout recorded history. When you consider that conspirators deposed six Caesars in a row (starting with Julius), one American president by a cons piracy in Dallas is not so hard to b elieve.\" What about those six Caesars? Julius Caesar was indeed stabbed by conspirato rs, but in a public place and everybody knew who the conspirators were. His successor Augustus had one of the longest and most successful reigns in history. He was virtually worshiped by the people of Rome and died of natural causes when he was an old man. Augustus's successor Tiberius was not nearly as successful or popular, but he died in his bed at the age of seve nty-three. The next Caesar, Caligula, was seriously insane and was killed by his officers. Claudius Caes ar was an old man when he died. He may have been poisoned, b ut this is by no means certain. Nero was overthrown in a revolt by the army, and he killed hims elf. The next three Caesars died in quick succession in the civil wars that swept Rome. A revolt and a civil wa r are not conspiracies. That business about six Caesars being deposed by conspiracies came out of the Robert Graves novel I Claudius , or more p robably from the popular televisi on series made from the novel. It's very good dr ama, but very bad history. Nevertheless, a lot of people, including those who wrote this particular cons piracy book, seem to think that it is real history. History, be it ancient Roman history or modern American history, is too comp licated and too chaotic to be smoothly manipulated by a single grand cons piracy. Small and seemingly trivial events, li ke small and trivial people, can sometimes have enormous effects. And we ll-laid plans often have totally unexpected consequences. In conspiracy theory everything works smoothly for the c onspirators. No one messes up the plan. There are no conflicts among conspirators. No one spills the beans. There are no unfor eseen events. But the real world doesn't work that way. Not long ago I talked to a retired CIA official. He said th at since the CIA was a secret organization, people who didn't know anything about it could claim that it did pr actically anything and there was no effective way to refute the claim. He thought t hat b y and large that had been good for the agency, \"beca use people didn't know how often we messed up.\" And then he said, a little wistfully I think, \"If on ly we had been as powerful as people thought we were.\" 4 Conspiracy theory can be fun. It is ente rtaining and essentially harmle ss to speculate about UFOs in the Nevada desert or who is really buried in John Wilkes Booth's grave. But conspiracy theories can also produce horrifying results. If people are convinced that their government ha s secretly been taken over by hos tile and alien forces that are out to deprive them of their freedom and perhaps their very lives, we should not be surprised when some of th ese people get \"carried away\" and try to strike back by shooting agents of the government or blowing up government buildings. That is not \"entertaining\" at all. "},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":" Notes Introduction 1.
